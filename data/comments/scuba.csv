scuba,3e2wkr,Captain-Atomic,41,Tue Jul 21 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"No!!!! (but good question!)  I'm a hyperbaric technician/dive medic, and work both in the field and  in a medical chamber for wound healing.  Hyperbaric oxygen is a treatment for diseases, not a superpower.  For the same reason that taking antibiotics because they're 'medicine' doesn't work for viral infections, so HBOT doesn't work for people with normally functioning vasculature.   HBOT is a process that improves the oxygenation of the blood.  The thing is, our body is already pretty good on the oxygen front- if you're  a healthy, well-circulating adult, then the limiting factor in wound healing is NOT oxygen.  Therefore, more does not mean faster.  For diabetics, radiation-damaged skin, crush injuries, and burns however, the vessels that normally transport blood are damaged/destroyed.  What little remains is left carrying the workload, and it usually can't do it all by itself.  So, by dissolving oxygen under pressure into the bloodstream, we super-oxygenate the blood so that in those injured areas that only receive 10% of the blood necessary to heal all of a sudden get 10,000% oxygen content.  When all is said and done, they end up healing like a normal person (by removing the limiting factor of oxygen) for 2ish hours under treatment.  Which is the last point- HBOT treatments are usually given 20-60 treatments at two hours a piece per day.  This is because when you or I get a cut, it'll take a couple of days to heal.  Because patients only heal while they're in the chamber, however, they get get 40-120 hours to ensure proper healing.  So in reality, the wounds don't heal faster, they simply heal like normal.  Hope this helps and I'll happily answer any other oxygen/pressure related questions you guys have. It's a really misconstrued topic that shady people exploit for financial gain so I'm happy to clarify when I can."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:03 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask what a dive medic is? Ive never heard of that job before.
scuba,3e2wkr,Cr00chy,3,Tue Jul 21 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"Here's a basic description from one of the certifying bodies.  It's an extended scope of practice from EMT that's focused on diving injuries out of the water.  It's mostly used in commercial diving to train the people who will treat patients inside of a chamber on oil platforms/long-distance treatments.  One dive physician would then be on call, phone-in, and direct treatment to the medics.  For me, I work as a consultant for various dive groups/dive-trips/environmental companies as kind of a live aboard medical control.  If someone gets injured/DCS, I can stabilize and treat long enough for a 1-2 day transport to a chamber/hospital."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,12,Tue Jul 21 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"No, but not for the reasons you list. If I'm diving nitrox, I'm probably doing 3 to 6 dives in a day, and probably in salt water. Cuts and abrasions in water all day don't heal worth a damn."
scuba,3e2wkr,kungfudiver,4,Tue Jul 21 15:54:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, can confirm. I work as a Divemaster in Thailand, I dive 2 to 5 times a day 6 days a week. The smallest cut can take weeks to heal and can get infected real easy. I don't dive with Nitrox often though (most of the dive sites are 18 meters max) so I can't help with OP's question."
scuba,3e2wkr,Stinkin_Hippy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I hate to derail OP's thread, but I've always wondered how Divemasters working at a resort, diving day in and day out, deal with cuts in the regard of being in water all the time? After a week and a half of diving, I usually have a handful of things that need ointment and band-aids."
scuba,3e2wkr,kungfudiver,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:08 2015 UTC,Cyanoacrylate glue does an admirable job of keeping a cut closed and dirt and moisture out. When I'm diving a lot and getting small cuts- you can bet I have some handy.

scuba,3e2wkr,recluce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:09 2015 UTC,I don't understand the downvotes on this as this is the correct answer.  If you are getting cut up during a week of diving you need to practice your buoyancy skills.
scuba,3e2wkr,garuba2,0,Tue Jul 21 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"My personal way is to avoid cuts in the first place, I rarely, if ever, get cuts underwater. With good buoyancy you can avoid it but on things like wreck dives in a strong currant accidents can happen. You can also acquire cuts in day to day life outside of working / diving. If I do get a cut I use antibiotic cream (in the climate of Thailand and being in the water they get infected so easily) then like Stds9tng says cyanoacrylate glue is a life saver. I use it to close the cut then add an extra layer on top to stop water getting in and finally a waterproof plaster on top just to be extra safe.  Bigger cuts and grazes mean no diving for potentially weeks and no diving means no money. Professional divers like me make very little money anyway so we avoid cuts and grazes like the plague."

scuba,3e2wkr,texasguy911,3,Tue Jul 21 22:54:53 2015 UTC,Everybody says its not true but I confess I do feel better after doing a long 6 meter stop on nearly pure O2 rather than air.  While the guys on air stagger off the lift and flop on the bench with a cup of tea we oxygen breathers bounce around the boat annoyingly wanting to talk about the dive and show you our pictures. I'm probably going to get a weight belt wrapped round my head one day doing that. I don't think I've noticed wounds healing though but I don't have many.
scuba,3e2wkr,nigelh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"I replied to someone else below, but nitrox/High ppO2 is really frequently reported to cause less fatigue after dives.  From a medical perspective, we're not really sure why this happens outside of educated guesses.  It shouldn't happen, but it does.    Wound healing though is a completely different beast, and nitrox diving or any oxygen treatment for a healthy person will have 0 effect on cuts/scrapes/healing."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:12 2015 UTC,Could it be placebo? If people are told and / or think that Nitrox will make them feel less tired after a dive then the placebo effect might kick in and the believe they are less tired so they act less tired.
scuba,3e2wkr,Stinkin_Hippy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"It can always be placebo!  The truth is that there are a lot of factors in play, and the science behind it is both complicated and lacking.  There's a distinct physiological difference between the body's use of nitrox vs. air, so to shrug it off as placebo isn't quite doing it diligence.  That said, our current medical knowledge would say there's little the difference should make on someone's energy level after diving.  Whether that's an effect of inaccurate knowledge or inaccurate perception of tiredness is anyone's guess.   Like I said in another comment, my totally unsubstantiated hunch is that there's a small decrease in metabolic stress due to more oxygen availability while people dive- which is essentially semi-rigorous exercise. The reason some people report major changes in fatigue versus almost none may then depend on how efficient their ability to oxygenate tissue already is.  Combine this with a distinct preconception to ""feel better"" because people have already told you to expect it, and you'll end up with a major ideal of ""nitrox makes me feel better"".  There's also a totally un-researched aspect of the different places, depths, temperatures, fitness levels, frequencies, and ages that nitrox dives occur with versus air (on average), which all can play a part in the overall notion of its effects."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,7,Wed Jul 22 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I have, and more. In addition to feeling less tired after a dive and cuts and scrapes healed, I also notice my wife and other females become more attracted to me, I believe it's because the higher level of oxygen gives me a little more ""color"" under the skin, signalling my potency as a sexual partner."

I don't know if it's psychosomatic or what.    I'd be interested to hear others experiences with this, or if anyone has heard of any studies that would show benefits from diving Nitrox besides the extra bottom time."
scuba,3e2wkr,thumb0,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"People report being less tired very commonly, although there's not a great explanation as to why.  Less nitrogen (and here's where the medical research/what actually happens barrier gets crossed) SHOULDN'T make a difference on your energy level, but sure enough it's a pretty easily felt effect.  There's no medical benefit though, especially concerning wound healing- that's for sure."

Well- one of the symptoms of DCS is fatigue. Fatigue isn't a binary state so there is the possibility that people are experiencing sub-clinical DCS.  Diving Nitrox (assuming air tables) would result in less nitrogen loading which would lessen the symptoms. Whether that's what's actually happening is a different issue.  The best way to test whether the effects are psychosomatic would be to give divers a tank that may or may not contain nitrox and have them report how they feel after the dive. With enough divers and enough dives you could do a reasonable analysis- but you would also have to violate the rule that the diver must analyze the contents of their tank themselves."
scuba,3e2wkr,stds9tng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"I totally get your line of logic, but physiologically it's a bit reverse.  The fatigue is a result of the symptoms, the symptoms being the sign of DCS.  Without there first being nitrogen damage, you 'shouldn't' be getting tired.  My guess would be much more simple- when you exercise a lot it helps to have some extra O2 to keep your body oxygenated.  Might simply be a minute difference in the amount of effort your body/circulatory system has to deal with by having a bit more O2 to work with."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"The fatigue is a result of the symptoms, the symptoms being the sign of DCS.    From a first aid perspective- signs are anything you notice as a responder- symptoms are anything the patient reports.  Specifically- a symptom is ""a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease.""  In this case fatigue is a symptom reported by the patient and it is one of many known symptoms of DCS.  Fatigue can't be a result of symptoms- symptoms are simply signposts that point towards a diagnosis.   Without there first being nitrogen damage, you 'shouldn't' be getting tired.   There are many factor at play in DCS- everything from physical trauma to the tissues due to the formation of bubbles to immune system reactions that cause inflammation and irritation even when the bubbles themselves aren't problematic.  Micro bubble formation has been demonstrated (via Doppler studies) in divers even in cases where the diver shows no signs or symptoms of DCS. Conversely- a diver with even mild bubble formation may have an immunological reaction that exacerbates the condition and can result in fatigue and other signs and symptoms.   My guess would be much more simple- when you exercise a lot it helps to have some extra O2 to keep your body oxygenated. Might simply be a minute difference in the amount of effort your body/circulatory system has to deal with by having a bit more O2 to work with.   There are lots of possibilities- and the truth is we don't know for certain what's going on.  That said- if you spend any time on a technical dive boat you'll see a lot of divers sleeping and exhausted right after their dives- even though they didn't exert themselves. Meanwhile- recreational divers that didn't go very deep, but were kicking like mad men and building lots of CO2, aren't even remotely tired after their dives.  It's a complex question- and the only way to find definitive answers would be a whole lot more study- something that's unlikely to happen any time soon :)"
scuba,3e2wkr,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:34:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree- and yes, I know all about what nitrogen does physiologically. My intent was to keep it simple for the sub to understand.   Quick note- one of the more interesting cases involving diving related inflammation, oddly enough, is carbon monoxide- commercial fishermen in developing countries that get carbon monoxide poisoning from their compressor engines are amazingly resilient to DCS.  It's potentially from a chemical inhibition of the inflammatory response from nitrogen by the CO molecules.    Anyways, you're totally right, and I wasn't trying to be technical about my signs/symptoms.  But what I'm trying to express is that when you get down to the nitty gritty physiology, the difference in nitrogen loads between nitrox and air should not be causing a significant difference in energy levels.  ESPECIALLY across such a wide variety of dive profiles.    Of course nitrogen will play a factor in fatigue, especially in a technical/recreational spectrum.  But things like pressure, temperature, stress, and so many other things are easily conflated with nitrogen to make this connection. When nitrogen is an isolated variable, and this has been studied- it simply does not do enough to upset the body in a pre-DCS condition to make the difference between ""I'm happy!"" and ""I'm exhausted"".   The truth is, we have a terrible understanding of what DCS is- like you said.  Even diagnosing it is a crapshoot.  But part of that is the very partial evidence that nitrogen plays, and the very major part that anatomical and physiological differences have in it. We've done so many microbubble studies, and it's gotten us nowhere. It's at the point that some researchers are suggesting non-bubble related pathologies altogether.  So what is the point?  The point is that because of our poor understanding of nitrogen, combined with the easily misconstrued relationship of nitrogen to sleepiness, my guess is that the nitrox difference is not about nitrogen but something else entirely.  Oxygen content, average profiles/temps/ages/experience/fitness levels/depths with nitrox vs. recreational users, etc.- any of those could be more likely in my mind.  That said, I agree again- we can't say for sure.  But I'd hazard a guess that testing would be better in a chamber with a double blind with controlled patient groups, just to keep out my theory that the oxygen is making it easier from a fitness perspective."
scuba,3e2wkr,climbrocker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying- I was simply positing another potential explanation. As we've both said- DCS is a lot less well understood than most people realize and that's not going to change unless, and until, we perform more (and better) experiments."
scuba,3e2wkr,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:41:42 2015 UTC,"I like it!  Also, as an insider sidenote- one of the reasons that the research is a bit lacking is a lack of will to investigate.  A lot of the hyperbaric chambers in use are strictly privately owned, and no chamber group is going to finance or allow research using their chambers that could show hyperbarics to be ineffective. So while DCS is being tackled by certain groups, a lot of the physiological understanding is less understood because hospital-based systems are reluctant to develop better understandings.  This is a big problem for diabetic wounds/clinical HBOT especially."

scuba,3e2wkr,useallthewasabi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"Patients will usually dive what's called a treatment table 9, which will be 40-45'fsw (depending on the clinic) for 2 hours daily.

On one dive we headed in the direction of the bow and ran into a massive wall of vertical steel hull that looks to go up to about 180, but we didn't ascend to check it out. Promenade windows, large pieces of deck, hull, snarled cables are strewn about in huge piles of unrecognizable debris. All of the penetrations we looked at were really hairy and didn't seem worth the risk. Really tough to tell where you are on the wreck in any given place.

scuba,3dzogx,common_senser,4,Mon Jul 20 22:16:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth the trip. Originally we were scheduled for 3 days and 5 dives. The first dive was cancelled due to 6-8 footers the night we were supposed to travel. Left the Point Judith, RI dock at 3AM. We made it out that afternoon and got one dive in glassy pristine water. Two dives the next day and then the wind started to pick up so we called the last dive the next morning as it was getting pretty choppy and the forecast looked miserable. They have gas on board, but we ended up bringing our own. Transfilled from a set of 120's filled with 10/50 and a 100 of O2 and that was plenty for me and my buddy. They had a booster on board for anyone to use if needed. They did have a T of 10/50 on board for anyone to use as well, but since we brought our own we didn't end up needing any. If you're diving OC I would definitely bring all of the doubles and stages you intend to use on the dives, but logistically it was very easy to do with a rebreather. They do have a compressor on board, but I've heard not to trust the air quality, so we just used it to fill our dry suit bottles. If you want contact info on who to get in touch with shoot me a PM."

scuba,3dzogx,rebo2,3,Tue Jul 21 10:12:01 2015 UTC,"We didn't do any penetration on the wreck. The stern is very collapsed so it would be tough to find a place to enter. It's good to soak plates you find in fresh water for about 6 months, changing the water weekly to try to get the salt out that has leeched into the porcelain. If dried right away, the plate will shrink enough to shatter. Here's a picture of the front: http://i.imgur.com/Iw1TMkX.jpg"

Very little to zero current. 15-20 ft of vis. 51 degrees F bottom temp with 65 degrees on our 15 ft stop. Nice and toasty.

scuba,3e2sfk,ctobin1,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"First,  The agency that delivers your C-Card - be it PADI, NAUI, SDI ... is mostly irrelevant. Choose your instructor/shop based on reviews and recommendations - a good instructor is the most important thing. All accredited agencies follow the same minimum curriculum and are recognized worldwide.  Second,  Don't buy any gear. Part of your course includes basic instruction on how to properly fit your personal gear (mask snorkel and fins) and also what to look for and what to avoid.  Third,  When you do buy your personal gear. Don't skimp. Buy what fits and feels best and what will last. Decent gear will last you a long, long time.  Fourth,  Don't be cheap, get fins with a spring or bungee style strap. Much easier to put on and they will stay on. After market springs straps just don't work as well and generally have failure points that original equipment straps don't."
scuba,3e2sfk,CanadianDiver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a novice myself but I've been learning a lot while I've been studying for my own PADI Open Water. From what I've learned PADI is the most well known international diving certification worldwide, they run just about every aspect of diving from recreational to professional Specialist diving. So with them, you can get your gear sized up and recommended to you from a PADI dive shop, get certification in recreational or specialized diving, and even book PADI resort dive vacations or trips.  PADI Open Water is the entry level certification, which allows you to branch off from there into Advanced Open Water Diver or another specialized course (you will learn that there are a LOT of different courses catering to the most specific of dives and equipment.  PADI Open Water is the entry level for being a certified diver, but before that there are two programs I know of that could help get you into it of you are unsure. There is the Discover program which is about $80 and it's a day spent learning a bit about scuba and testing it out to see if you like it, then the Scuba diver course which allows you go to dive resorts as long as you are always with a Divemaster. If you've already decided you want t do it, skip scuba and discover and just go for Open Water, if your still unsure look into Discover.  As for gear, you will need fins, snorkel, mask for your Open Water course, but I recommend buying your own exposure suit(s), regulator, and BCD down the line, as it just makes it more familiar and convenient.  Scuba gear can be expensive as an upfront cost, what you pay is what you get is the name of the game here. But keep in mind if you buy high quality the gear could last you decades with proper care, so of you dive enough it pays for itself after a fairly short while.  I may have missed some things, but have fun! I'm really enjoying learning from the textbook. It's easy to understand and pretty straightforward and informative. Cheers!"
scuba,3e2sfk,hellcat858,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"When I was in college I took a NAUI class as a semester course but never did the checkout dives and a few years later I got certified through PADI. I remember the NAUI course going into a lot more of the science-nitty-gritty theory behind diving and it's mechanics. PADI will probably get you in the water faster and you'll still know everything you need to be a proficient diver. Having said that I still use the knowledge learned in that NAUI class to this day--I guess it really depends on how much information you want to expose yourself to right off the bat.  hellcat858 is right, all you really need for your cert is personal gear like mask, fins, booties, gloves etc."

scuba,3e2sfk,runsongas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on wanting to learn to dive! I've always said, ""Welcome to our addiction."" Advice for the new diver? A couple others have given some good input. Most of the training agencies have the same basic standards; what sets one class apart from another is the instructor. Before choosing an instructor it's a good idea to do a little interview. Ask these questions: 1. How long have you been diving and how many logged dives do you have? 2. What are your certifications beyond Instructor? Where do you dive most? How long have you been an instructor and how many students have you taught? What levels of SCUBA diving are you qualified to teach? These are biggies but there are probably a few others. What you are looking for is someone who actually knows how to dive and doesn't have just the minimum requirements to become an instructor. A person like this will have the experiences to share with you and make you a better diver. As far as gear is concerned just buy the basic mask, fins, and snorkel now. Once you finish class and decide you want to go further start asking questions and learning. As you become familiar with the type of diving you are interested in then choose appropriate gear. If you like diving you should own your own gear for a variety of reasons."

scuba,3e2m5q,nigelh,4,Tue Jul 21 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"I think being able to see your buddy's eyes is way important. It's hard to gauge emotion while diving, smiles or frowns are hidden by the regulator, and body language is different because you're used to reading it on dry land.  A quick look at your buddy's eyes tell you if he's excited, angry, scared, confused, or even on the verge of passing out. And in a world where communication is reduced to hand signals, knowing these emotions can be important context in a potential emergency.  This is also why deaf people often look so emotive when signing. They can't convey things through tone, so they rely on non-verbal expression."

We can come up with solutions but they are all complex and carry risk of not working and leaving you open to unacceptable consequences. Much as I love diving if it became unsafe for me I would stop and have a big equipment sale. The only real solution would be a hard hat and I can't see anybody teaching you hard hat diving without a good background in diving already. Picture: me in a tank doing training.

scuba,3dzws6,GustavoTheMexicanBer,3,Mon Jul 20 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"My question is what is the pressure of the oxygen after it gets stepped down?   First off- do not ever breathe pure oxygen underwater unless you know exactly what you are doing. Pure oxygen is toxic under pressure and can cause a seizure resulting in you drowning.  That out of the way- modern regulators are two stage systems. The first stage, the part attached to the tank, takes the high pressure in the tank and drops it to an intermediate pressure. The intermediate pressure (or IP) is approximately 140 PSI above the ambient pressure. In other words- if you are at the surface- the pressure in the line is 140 PSI gauge or ~155 PSI absolute. At 2 atmospheres the pressure in the line would still be 140 PSI gauge (140 PSI above the ambient pressure)- but it would be 170 PSI absolute.  The second stage takes the intermediate pressure and drops it to whatever the ambient pressure is. At the surface that would be 0 gauge pressure or ~15 PSI absolute. At 33 feet is would still be 0 gauge but 30 PSI absolute.  Different regulators will have slightly different intermediate pressures- and the IP may vary with depth- but the above numbers are generally true."
scuba,3dzws6,stds9tng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"You can breathe pure oxygen up to 1.4 atm, which is about 20 FSW.  Sometimes higher mixes of o2 are used as a back gas to reduce deco time.  But yeah, you have to know what you're doing."
scuba,3dzws6,Kadugan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"It's 1.6 at 20', not 1.4.  Also- you can breathe oxygen much deeper than that if you had to- but the length of time you can do that gets shorter and shorter the deeper you go. You can look at the NOAA CNS exposure tables for more precise times."
scuba,3dzws6,stds9tng,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"The demand valve reduces the tank pressure to that of the surrounding water - ambient pressure. So at 10m, you're getting air delivered at 2bar."
scuba,3dzws6,Patmarker,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Normally you don't dive with 100% oxygen but if you are referring to SCUBA air, the air is stepped down in 2 steps with the intermediate pressure being about 135 - 155 PSI."
scuba,3dzws6,Kadugan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:00:24 2015 UTC,And what about the 2nd step when you actually breath it in?
scuba,3dzws6,butterbal1,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"Ambient pressure.  Right now you are sitting in ~1 atmosphere/1 Bar/ 14.7 PSI absolute.   If you suck on a 2nd stage regulator where you are sitting now you would create suction in the reg and it would open to get the internal pressure back to ambient pressure of 1Bar/14.7 PSI.  However most of the time when people see a pressure gauge they are reading ""Gauge pressure"" which is the delta between ambient and what is the the pressurized vessel.  So when you put a gauge on a bike tire and it reads 30PSI it actually means there is 30 PSIover ambient for a total of 45PSI absolute.    The easy answer with a tiny bit of wiggle room is the regulators supply gas at close to 0 PSI/Bar and anywhere from 15-75 PSI / 1-5 Bar absolute depending on depth(up to 120ft)."
scuba,3dzws6,nigelh,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:36 2015 UTC,Point one: not oxygen but others have pointed that out. Oxygen will kill you very quickly.  Point two: any pressure other than exactly matching your surroundings will rip your lungs up like wet toilet tissue. They have a huge internal area and the walls are microscopically thin.  The original Cousteau Aqualung valve ran at direct tank pressure and one of the innovations that made it work was to feed back the exhaled air to help close the valve. See twin hose regulator for details. It was smart and made things possible but it had a lot of snags. Now we drop the pressure to about 10bar above the current water pressure (say 145psi) with a regulator on the tank so the on-off valve in your mouth has a much easier life.
scuba,3dzws6,falco_iii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:19 2015 UTC,"Tank - Up to around 3000+ PSI.  Normally never less than 500 to 1000 PSI for safety. First stage & hose -  First stage drops air pressure from the tank down to around 140 PSI. Second stage & mouth piece - Second stage drops air pressure from the hose down to ""ambient pressure"" ~ 15 PSI at sea level, plus 15 PSI per 33 feet of depth. Side question: At 140 PSI, a perfectly balanced first stage could work down to 280 feet, correct?"
scuba,3dzws6,Kadugan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"The first stage has a little hole that allows it to sense the pressure in the water so it adjusts the intermediate pressure to compensate for the depth.  The intermediate pressure is always about the same, well until the pressure in the tank can't maintain it."
scuba,3dzws6,runsongas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:59 2015 UTC,the ip is measured as the difference from ambient pressure. the absolute pressure increases with depth to keep the delta between the ip and ambient the same.

Diving should come next. Build a bunch of experience doing actual decompression dives before you start pushing deeper. When things go wrong- you need to be completely at home dealing with the issue.   So my question is which piece of gear should I get first? The regs and gauges, deco regs, backplate/harness/wings etc?   You're going to need all of it so I'm not sure it matters all that much. If I had to pick one to start with it would be your BP/W simply because you can then size it for you. Next would be another Mk17 to complete your backmount regs. After that- you're going to need tanks, deco regs, another computer/bottom timer, and so on."
scuba,3dyben,stds9tng,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"This. Go dive. If you are borrowing/renting gear you might even learn a bit about what you really want to buy instead. stds9tng is right on with the gear too IMHO, BP/W and then your second reg.

scuba,3dyben,SevenTreeIsle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:30 2015 UTC,I bought a bp/w system first. I got one from diverightinscuba.com. After that I acquired some dive right weight pockets from eBay the last big purchase I made was a long hose reg set up by HOG.
scuba,3dyben,Trojaneuph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a good backplate/harness/wing - its the foundation of a good setup. Next I'd be inclined to get your regs sorted, some twin 12s and an ally 7 with a rigging kit. I did about 60 deco dives between BSAC accelerated deco and Sport/Explorer mixed gas - I'd recommend trying to get in a similar number, to make sure your buoyancy is tip-top, you're happy in the kit, your shutdown drills are slick and you're fully comfortable with gas and deco planning"
scuba,3dyben,jonny_boy27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say find a used bp/w on scubaboard first. You can find them for a couple hundred occasionally. If you really want to buy new, don't pay more than $125 for a stainless steel bp. I'd even go so far as to say don't pay more than $100 for a SS bp. I've used the divegearexpress.com's $75 ""Premium backplate"" and a Halcyon bp and they both dive the exact same. The Halcyon is $125 more and weighs 1lb more, but they dive the exact same so there is no point in spending the extra money unless you really want a blue (H).   DRIS actually has a deal on a HOG doubles bp/w for $399. http://www.diverightinscuba.com/sale-on-sale-techequipmentpackages-hoggear-bpwfullsetdoubles-html.html I've been diving the singles version of that rig for 3 years now and the only reason I'm not diving it anymore is because I've switched to sidemount.   Aside from that, you can also get dive rite stage/deco regs used for really cheap. Sometimes even 100 bucks for the 1st and 2nd stages. I loved my mk17/g250v but have switched to atomic M1's due to an issue I had at a dive shop when getting them serviced, but there is no way I'd pay those prices for those regs for stage/deco bottles. My main cylinders I put nice regs on since I use them most, but the 40cf bailout bottle I carry along with me I have an old Conshelf reg that I got for free and learned to service myself. Much easier than spending another $700+ on a 1st and 2nd stage.   Gear gets expensive really fast when you start buying stuff to outfit multiple rigs so I typically try to buy used."

Both are quite valid, this is a hobby after all, but beware that if you target is seeing things you want cheap but reliable, able to deliver your target depth but if it's gear stop and read lots and decide where you want to end up. There is no sense in building up a shed full of gear evolutions until you get your cold water 100 meter rebreather rig. Go straight to the whole stupid system at once. (Says the owner of lots of versions of scuba gear.)  I will probably annoy a lot of people saying it but really, doubles haven't been 'tech' for ten years or more."

scuba,3dyben,stds9tng,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:44 2015 UTC,Pretty much. If it's deep it's rebreathers these days. Shallow diving is still OC because you avoid complications but that isn't 'technical'.

At 40 meters on OC and you can virtually see the SPG fall as you breathe. I'm just not brave enough to dive OC deep as the SPG crashing towards the kill zone, that's why they colour it red isn't it, scares the bjebus out of me. It's not that diving twins isn't more technical than diving a single just that very few people use twins for demanding dives anymore.   What's ""shallow"" in this context?

What are the ol' WKPP doing fantastic work linking waterways on? It ain't twinsets no more. Wreck IDing, more my line, the old blendermatic takes care of the change of plan on the dive and you only need a gas plan for your bailout. What is shallow? I suspect that's a personal call but I personally wouldn't do a deco dive on OC any more. Using the Inspiration I am routinely using about 30 bar from each of my cylinders (O2/DIL/Suit) on a dive. That is actually almost independent of depth and time. I suspect that is because the long and deep dives involve so much time dangling on a string inactive and bored out of my skull that I don't use much extra gas.  I confess to being a bit of a kit freak. Nobody needs three rebreathers."

Please understand my response was mostly tongue in cheek- I know where you're coming from.

What are the ol' WKPP doing fantastic work linking waterways on?   I think you may have missed the joke :) My point was that a cave in Mexico is most definitely a technical dive- and most of it does not require a rebreather by any stretch of the imagination.

The last one is really dependant upon where and what kind of diving you are going to do. It also depends on what you want to get out of it. Are you looking to get your cert, or do you want to learn something new. If available, the DPV is fun. Wreck is also fun.  Down south, however ... a lot of AOW get stuck with 'Boat Dive' which is mostly useless.

scuba,3dx7dp,lalafied,3,Mon Jul 20 07:37:05 2015 UTC,"What you felt could well be a sinus squeeze. Normally, the sinuses in your head will equalize without you having to do anything. However, if something is blocking them, equalization will be more problematic. This can be caused by a cold.  Please be very careful when diving when you suspect your sinuses are blocked. You now suffered from pains when descending, but the opposite (i.e. pain when ascending, called a reverse block) can also occur. It such a situation, expanding gas in your sinuses can not find its way out and causes increased pressure inside your sinus cavities. This can be quite dangerous: not being able to call the dive when you want to and simply ascend (at a safe speed, of course) is a situation you do not want to be in."
scuba,3dx7dp,nl_the_shadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This is what I suspected it was. But I did not have a cold and was breathing freely through my nose before this occurred.  The first time I felt this was during descending in an airplane around 2 years ago. Since then it has been recurring occasionally but only during descent. I used to only feel ear squeeze during free diving and flying before that.   Always had problems with ear squeeze but I learnt to deal with that but this sinus problem get unbearable sometimes.  Given my history, do you think it might be too dangerous for me to continue diving or can I manage by using some nasal drops or something to clear my sinuses before a dive."
scuba,3dx7dp,rainman_104,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"As gross as it is, blow your nose out frequently and get that snot out of there.     I exhale out my nose a lot when I dive.

scuba,3dx7dp,cayal3,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:54 2015 UTC,"I was just certified almost 2 months ago, and during my 2nd pool dive I experienced a sinus squeeze right where my eyebrow, eye socket, and nose all meet. The pain was splitting, almost blinding. I just kept my cool and it worked its way out after a few minutes, but I was still a bit uncomfortable the rest of the dive. What you are describing sounded a lot like what I experienced.   I have had a lot of bad luck with sinus infections growing up. Days and days of mouth breathing while my nasal passages were completely sealed with green goo - At least once a year. So I already had thought right away that it was a sinus issue. I wasn't congested during my class, but a little allergies were bothering me. I could breathe easily through my nose, but I could feel a bit of gunk deep in my sinuses, which I think is often the source of these problems.  I was a bit worried that my new found love for scuba was going to be abruptly over, but I was determined to figure it out. I started really being on top of my hydration by carrying a water bottle around at work, to help clear everything out (just a good habit in general). The night before each class, I would take a sudafed, then once again in the morning. This helped me get through my classes with no pain. I haven't had the problem since and I don't even take the sudafed anymore. After a few more dives I think my sinus got used to the diving somehow(?), I still feel the air pushing their way through my skull as I descend but it is not uncomfortable.  The pain was bad in the deep end of the pool at first, but now I make dives regularly to 35ish feet with no problem.  To get rid of any congestion in the past, I used to use mucinex every day because it thins the mucus out and allows your sinuses to drain. Once clear, I would hit it with saline solution. I would avoid at home sinus irrigation unless you do it right, nobody wants a brain eating amoeba. Also I am not a doctor so I would not recommend taking sudafed and mucinex at the same time  Anyways I thought I would offer up as much information to help out. I would think that you might have sinus congestion, which doesn't necessarily constrict breathing through your nose.  If it works then you'll save yourself the trouble of surgery, I  myself was going to go that route if the sudafed didn't work. Let your instructor know whats going on so they can assist you if it happens again,  even in a pool it can be a dangerous situation and its most likely bad for your cranium.  Just for clarity, I am a new diver with much less experience that many on this subreddit. This is just my personal story and I hope the information helps you solve this issue so you can relax and have fun. As a beginner myself, I am not qualified to be giving much advice but I felt as if I could help in this situation."

Not just suck a little air, try to survive by breathing through that small hole.  Hell, even the tubing is too small to provide sufficient air to breathe.  Never mind the fact that the pump he uses to ""pressurize"" them would only give him a few PSI in the bottles IF they didn't leak through the many DIY connections he uses.

They are less affiliated with dive shops in Canada though there are still some ACUC shops out there.   The ACUC is really not a huge marketing engine and their programs are really not shop friendly because there is not so much to sell - unlike PADI. For the record I am both a PADI and an ACUC certified instructor.  ACUC is more popular with dive clubs. There materials and certifications are much cheaper, but honestly PADI puts a better effort into their training materials. Ultimately though, ACUC like PADI, SDI and SSI are all members of the WRSTC - and the minimum training curriculum is the same for all.  ACUC was founded in 1962, PADI was founded in 1966 ... My dive club was founded in 1956 and a few of our original members were involved in the founding of the ACUC.  All that history aside ... the initials on your c-card mean nothing. It all comes down to having a good instructor."

I did a refresher course through my local dive shop and then a couple of open water trips buddied with an instructor. I was amazed at how fast all the skills came back. Now I dive pretty much weekly. So yeah, go do a refresher course and some supervised dives till you get your groove back then get back in the water!"
scuba,3duaow,unauthorisedcinnamon,2,Sun Jul 19 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"If you did the course and dived a bit it might come back really fast, pay for a one to one accompanied dive. If you just did the course and dropped it you'll really need a full refresher."

As long as you have or had an ID card at one point you shouldn't have to retake the entire OW course."

If you want only to dive then go to those places but if you are looking for a full vacation I think Aruba is the way to go.  The beaches are pristine and the resorts are developed and beautiful. There are also many great restaurants on the island.   I dove two different Wrecks while I was there: the Antilla and the Perdinales. The Antilla was an amazing wreck dive and was largely in tact. It was approximately 300 feet long at at a depth of 40 feet. Visibility is incredible and we were able to see the entire leng of the ship. If you are certified to go inside there is actually an air pocket that has formed on the interior.   The Perdinales was a little less impressive but had some cool unexploded ordinances as well as different wildlife. On our trip we saw sea turtles, squid, and Caribbean lobster in addition to fish."

There is always the ""Hurricane Risk"" element to these trips - - around 3-4 weeks out, you'll get paranoid watching the weather.  Ironically, a flight itineraries going through a US City before getting to the Caribbean is often as much of a factor as ""will the small part of that big storm which actually causes damage actually hit our island?"".     If flights out of DC are an option for you, consider Cayman Airways - - they should advertise this better, but first 2 checked bags are free.    Similarly, consider taking the puddle jumper out to Little Cayman.

scuba,3ds9w3,AIAmor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:15 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth i'd recommend learning to dive in worse conditions than vacation spots.  I got certified in Kansas in some nasty quarry waters, so trim/buoyancy control were enforced early. Oh you want to see any of your gauges.... STOP KICKING UP THE CRAP ON THE BOTTOM!  So when I went on vacation in Hawaii following my cert, I felt like it was super easy and could just enjoy the dives.   The only time I did a dive cert on vacation was nitrox, which with the new PADI nitro course was just stupidly simple.  Read the book, answer the questions, watch the DVD, dive, take test, get cert.    The $250 sounds about like what I paid, but it usually doesn't include mask, fins, snorkel (which my shop made me buy and wouldn't rent).  Which honestly isn't a bad starter set of things to have.    If you are going to be doing guided tours, or heck I guess even unguided, then yes just a basic cert is fine.  Just dive within your own comfort limits.  The DMs, will likely take you past your cert depth (or at least that is my experience).    If you can I'd highly recommend just a basic wrist mounted computer.  Most rental sets don't have one and they just sort of trust the DMs to shepherd you through your limits and surface intervals. If you stay above the DM your entire dive you are fine but I always feel better knowing it with an instrument I trust and know.  I say it because if the DM is diving a computer you will bust your tables if you try and do it by hand, just the nature of diving computers vs tables (yes, technically OP could do the math but how many basic OW divers record every ascent/descent and time spent there?).     The only deal I have seen is sometimes if you train at a vacation dive center they reduce the boat fees vs just booking a spot on the dive charter. Though from what I have seen it isn't much.    Sorry for the ramble."
scuba,3ds9w3,kardiffkook,2,Sun Jul 19 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"I would always recommend a hose-integrated computer for the new diver. It's important to see how your actual air consumption affects bottom time. If anything, shouldn't OP get practice using tables?"
scuba,3ds9w3,AIAmor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"As to the hose-integrated computer.  You can get a air-integrated watch computer, but start out with just the dive computer part if saving costs.  I think it helps break up the cost of the computer/reg setup to a new diver and gives, to me, the most important function.  The air consumption bit is important but you can just write down starting PSI/Bar and ending PSI/bar and compare with total dive time to see the correlation. That and I just prefer wrist worn dive computers, since I can look at my gauges/computer/compass and still have use of both hands, not something I can do with a console mount.    As to the tables I agree he should keep up/refine the skill. I can honestly say I have never been on a DM led vacation dive where I saw someone run a table and surfaced on the time from the tables, it is just so restrictive versus a computer.  They just followed the DM and trusted in him and surfaced when they were low on air or had a dive computer followed that.  Is that right, no. However, it seems to be reality for the casual resort/vacation diver. I'll do a table dive occasionally on a shallow local dive, where the table's bottom time isn't overly punitive, but when on vacation I rely almost solely on my computer."
scuba,3ds9w3,AIAmor,2,Sun Jul 19 07:59:58 2015 UTC,"I had assumed your recommendation was for rental gear, based on OP's situation. I've never run into a vacation dive spot that rents wrist computers (especially air integrated) to OW divers. That being said, I absolutely would recommend everyone try a wristmount out to find out what type of personal gear they want.   Part 2: You're absolutely right. I've never seen a table used on a vacation dive."
scuba,3ds9w3,nigelh,2,Sun Jul 19 08:25:43 2015 UTC,It would be better to be certified beforehand. It will offer you more flexibility on your vacation and you will have more experience to judge the safety of whatever dive you are doing.   A PADI certification will be just fine throughout Asia.

That's just an indicator of sloppy practice or poor training."

As to flaws, I can't speak for the whole system, but the route I went down was very good, and I wouldn't question any of it, particularly when talking about the chemistry side of it.

However as a retired Industrial Physicist I'm probably bound to come up with something like that. Physics is rather my thing.  Now let's be clear. Doing 'ordinary' diving all you need to do is follow the rules you were taught and you are applying the deductions of good physics but once you start to go deep, move out of the no-stop model or start breathing gases other than air then physics is one of your key dive planning tools.  Can I be smug and point you to some of the stuff I have already written when a forum post couldn't answer a question clearly.

scuba,3dqh8u,Altered_Amiba,3,Mon Jul 20 10:36:55 2015 UTC,"I would say that most ""got certified to go on a trip"" divers pretty much follow the rules and guidelines. That is fine for basic diving when you rely on a diver master to plan the dive.   As a diver advances they are required to think more critically about what they are doing.   Tech divers often say that the excitement is in planing the dive and then executing it correctly.   First a diver must know their surface air consumption rate and calculate how much they will breath at each stage of the dive.  Then they must figure out the correct partial pressures of breathing gasses for each stage of the dive. Nitrogen becomes narcotic around a partial pressure of 4-5 ATM so a diver must pick their safety factor. Oxygen becomes toxic quickly at 1.6 ATM of partial pressure, but is also toxic for long exposures over 0.4 ATM, and a partial pressure of less than 0.18 is deadly.   Helium is non-narcotic, but enters and exits the body's tissues dramatically faster than nitrogen.   This all brings up decompression theory, and it is still very much a theory. We start talking about variably permeable membranes, tissue half lives, gradient factors, and a lot of theories about our bodies off gas. For instance it might not be smart to switch from a bottom gas that is 60% helium to a decompression gas that has 0% helium, because your body will try to off gas the helium at a dangerous rate (in water decompression sickness is not a fun idea to think about, especially if your still an hour+ from the surface). Do deep stops help your body off gas from hard tissues with a slower half live more efficiently? Do you plan your stops at 70% of the max dissolved gas of the theoretical tissue groups, or 85%?   This all comes together in planning how much of each type of mix to carry and when you will use it. And now you are limited by the practicality of carrying that much breathing gas. Thank God I dive a rebreather that can mix gas on the fly, but then again, now I need to add CO2 into the mix, soda lime, and the caustic reaction that is created when soda lime gets wet."
scuba,3dqh8u,cradossk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm looking into mixed-gas diving now to see what divers have to know and do about it.   Would there be any set standards or guidelines to tell you how to figure out partial pressures? Might be answered myself after I do a bit more research though...  And follow up question, do you think there are any flaws with the current standard guidelines/procedures?"
scuba,3dqh8u,cradossk,2,Sun Jul 19 12:28:53 2015 UTC,"Did chemistry in high school and university.  The different gas laws (Charles, Henry, Boyle) come in handy when diving although I just remember them as the ideal gas law:  PV=NRT and derive the required relationship from there.    Deeper = increase pressure (+P). Deeper (+P) -> increase in amount of air consumed (+N).  Thus, watch your air pressure as you go deeper. . Increased or free flow = decrease in pressure (-P). Increased or free flow (-P) -> decrease in temperature (-T).  Thus, watch out for freeze-ups in cold water with increased or free flow."

Purge the air in your suit by squeezing and squatting down, particularly if you're somewhere humid.  Do you put a LOT of air in your drysuit because you're overweighted?  Do air bubbles escape from neck/wrist seals?  Water will get in when that happens.  Make sure any hair is pulled out of the seal, as it will act as a wick for water."

Close up the suit and exhaust valve, and fill it up with the power inflator. Then use a spray bottle with soapy water along all the seams  and zipper looking for small bubbles. If that doesn't find any then start looking for pin holes with the same method along the panels of the suit.   Dry suits can be patched, and they rarely are 100% dry but they shouldn't let that much water in."

scuba,3dquwx,WnbTravellerDude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:05:20 2015 UTC,"Its worth noting from where the wetness started. I dive with a very old suit (Not used that much, but very old) and I know the zipped leaks a bit (not actually my suit, and no money to fix it now, since while being damp, it still fits my needs enough). So Im always a bit wet around the zipper area. But if you actually felt that you had water moving in the suit, Id say it leaked quite much from somewhere. I did once break the suit a bit in my leg at the end of the dive (in a wreck) and it still just made my undergarments wet even tho the hole was noticeable. I didnt feel any loose water in the suit."
scuba,3dquwx,metajames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"I believe this suit is equipped with a TiZip (Plastic Zipper). Make sure you properly lubricated the zipper, especially the docking end. The TiZip can leak if the docking end is not adequately lubricated."
scuba,3dquwx,stds9tng,2,Sun Jul 19 09:39:51 2015 UTC,It is not- the EverDry 4 has a traditional brass dry suit zipper.
scuba,3dquwx,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:41:02 2015 UTC,The Neoprene wrist seals on the EveryDry 4 will often leak slightly- they're just not as flexible as a silicone wrist seal. The same for the neck seal.  Mind you I'm talking about a small amount of water- If you're pouring water out of the suit at the end of the dive- then something is wrong.

scuba,3dnfsk,jitterfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Your instructor will likely overweigh you as you won't be breathing optimally. It also prevents a rapid ascent during the safety stop due to your tank being more buoyant than at the start of the dive.  But too much weight also means poor air consumption as you'll be wasting it into your BCD. You'll also be flailing around more as a lot of weight can make it difficult to maintain a zen-like horizontal position.  After you get certified the first thing to work on is neutral bouyancy using breath control, then try to lose a few pieces of lead. You'll have a far more enjoyable experience.  Good luck on your OW dives. Im sure you'll ace it; they're super easy."

I'd recommend getting a ton of dives under your belt, to the point of where everything is completely routine.  If you live on a boat during the internship then you'll probably get free accommodations but you'll be responsible for filling tanks and making sure all the clients are happy.   Something else to consider: once you have your DM certification, it'll be tough for you to not want to flash it. Having it means you are also on call all the time during vacation"

scuba,3dmzh9,stds9tng,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"Approximately how many do you mean by ""a ton of dives""?

I'm prepared to deal with any emergency that comes up with the divers I'm leading, and can handle it calmly and gracefully. I do not have emergencies because I am thorough and careful in my pre-dive checks and if an issue does arise- I can handle it without losing situational awareness. My trim and buoyancy are excellent and second nature.""  You still have to do AOW and rescue so don't get ahead of yourself. When you start diving deeper (AOW) and having to do rescue exercises you may decide that you don't actually want that responsibility."

If you like this lifestyle and become an experienced diver it makes sense to progress on to dive instructor. You are more useful to dive shops (you can lead dives, DSDs, and teach; in general command more respect) and can earn more money to fund your travels.   With Thailand you want to be aware that the business is seasonal and that there's not much point turning up for a dive master course at the end of the season and then expecting to stay on to the next season 5-6 months away. If this is what you want talk to prospective dive shops in advance and explain what you'd like to do. Accept that you may be rejected a lot as there can be a lot of competition for these dive master internships and at the end of the day it often comes down to timing and luck."

But basically, if it's not really cheap, why risk all of the unknowns of someone else's equipment. Part of this is definitely the life support equipment argument though.

Kind of, market is saturated by used similar/same items. Everyone wants to sell them. Having the items in mint condition is not uncommon.  Usually it is the first scuba gear that people buy and then cannot sell. Some never dive afterwards, it just sits, others that dive want a different gear, this one sits again. Newly baked divers usually are ""helped"" by their dive shop to get the ""right"" gear. Thus, these particular divers, new divers, mostly buy new gear from the dive shops, new divers don't know what they want and need or how to assess used gear. Thus, there is this vicious circle where new basic gear is bought and then needs to be unloaded as used. However, the potential buyers for that gear are the new students and they are exclusively fully dressed by the dive shop mafia. ;) Thus, this slightly used basic scuba gear has little market.  Then I seen some ""garage sales"" where people discover that they still have some scuba gear from like 10 years ago, might not even be theirs. So, they put up museum pieces for sale for prices for a set that can buy a used car.   Thus, depends on scuba gear. If it is highend scuba gear, there is a big market. Say, right scooters are easy to sell. Drysuits of recent years of good brands/models is easy to sell if size is right (L or XL).   Then there are items like fins or masks that really not that expensive and majority would rather buy new. Like catheters ;) I kid.  Thus, there is certain used scuba gear that just won't sell.

Not as good as it used to be. Lots of tourists and huge operations mean diving is not as good as it once was. Coral is slowly dieing off. The day trip boat dive sites tend to be busy. Best bet is a liveaboard apparently as it goes to dive sites that are less busy and more alive  Fiji - Did a few dives around the Yasawa islands. It was pretty good. Lots of fish and some interesting reefs. Lots of sharks around Fiji (although I didnt see any). Heard a few good things about Fiji for shark diving though.  Cook Islands - I have done Raro and Aitutaki. The reef is awesome for snorkling, once you get out past the reef and dive a little deeper, the reef is a bit dead and battered from weather over time. Lots of fish to see though. A few sharks here and there. Huge turtles too. I actually thought Raro had better diving that Aitutaki. They have a pretty cool pinacle dive which has lots of lion fish, eels and sharks. Shallower dives in ocean vallys and caves had more turtles and sharks  Asia - Did a few spec courses in Koh Tao. Diving was okay, but VERY busy. If you go in the right season, you have a chance of whale sharks. The diving overall was pretty easy and pretty enjoyable. Cheap too. But most sites had at least 3-4 other dive centres there.  Borneo/Sipadan - THE BEST BY FAR. Incredible diving. Best place I have ever dived. I dived with seaventures which is this liveaboard/oil rig thing you can stay on. It was recommendation from r/scuba actually. The dives are just so magical and alive. I have never seen anything like.

scuba,3dlo3j,jitterfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:51:31 2015 UTC,Question back for you OP. Where are some good dive sites in NZ that you would recommend as a kiwi diver?
scuba,3dlo3j,jitterfish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"Fiod Land is basically a bunch of valleys full of water. It's really deepso you dive along the walls. There's a metric fuckton of crayfish so you can do a live in boat thing and eat them every night if you want. Also a load of fresh water pours down onto the salt water creating a fresh water layer. Because of this the pressure in the salt water is abnormal which results in things like black coral growing at relatively shallow depths. Due to the remoteness this is a smidge pricier.  There are a few wrecks around. There's one of a Soviet cruise ship, I haven't dived it personally but I hear that it is pretty dependant on good conditions.  The other two wrecks that I can think of are the HMNZS Canterbury which was a battleship thatgot retired and sunk as a dive spot. I have done this one and it's great. The ship is in brilliant condition, there are heaps of fish and a few areas for swim throughs. There's also a few cool things like the telephone box still being intact. The Rainbow Warrior is the other wreck. It was a Green Peace ship that French agents sank to stop it leading anti nuclear testing protests in the pacific. It's like the Canterbury, good shape lots of fish. Both of these wrecks are good and conditions don't really fuck them up (I've been on the Canterbury with vis from bow to stern and with 10m vis, being generous, both times were fantastic) and as a bonus they're in the same area so you could do a week or so long trip and get both done plus another two dives in good spots with kelp forest or bare sand type landscapes.  There are also some great marine reserves. Goat Island and the Poor Knights in the North and Stewart Island at the bottom of the South Island. If you're lucky you can see sharks at Stewart Island. Dolphins, Orcas, Seals, Penguins and Rays aren't uncommon between Goat and the Knights. Poor Knights also has a few massive Snapper because it's been a reserve for so long. Goat Island is also only about an hour or so drive from Auckland if you wanna visit the city as well. As an Aucklander it's super easy to get the tanks and do a day trip up to the Goat Island area and do some shore diving before coming home, hosing down and be having a cold one by 5pm-ish or earlier.  That's all I can think of at the moment so a search will yield more good spots but those are probably our best spots."

That restricts the flow. Many regulators also have a teeny tiny hole in the hp port. This is because there's no real flow needed, the air pressure just needs to press against the spg/ computer pressure sensor.   Low pressure hoses and port internals, in contrast, have much larger internal diameters because breathing demands far more volume to move through the hose."

scuba,3dgjic,stds9tng,2,Thu Jul 16 05:05:21 2015 UTC,"3-5 minutes to completely empty an AL80.  If you get a free flow in cold water it's likely do to a freeze. The cold escaping air keeps it cold so it keeps free flowing. If you turn off the tank, let the ice melt for a couple of minutes, then turn it back on- it will probably stop.....  However.... This is an advanced exercise and even if it stops you should end the dive because it could easily happen again.  Your buddy did exactly what he should have- gave you his alternate/pony, tried for a few seconds to solve the problem, shut off your tank, and brought you to the surface.  A free flow is a serious issue and you definitely need to get to the surface quickly (but at a safe rate). Don't dawdle :)"
scuba,3dgjic,CactusPete,0,Thu Jul 16 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"I admittedly don't know the standard training mantras for this situation - but I question turning off the tank.  That converts a potentially useless air supply (once it runs out) into an absolutely useless one (since its shut off).  Buddy breathing, or taking air from a buddy, can raise other problems (tho happily it didn't hear).  I wonder if a smoother course might be to breathe off the freeflowing reg, or switch to octo and kink the primary hose if poss, but even if not, start a normal ascent and watch the pressure guage constantly.   Even if the tank were to empty in 2 minutes, that's enough for a reasonably normal ascent from 80 feet - and as you ascend, the rate of tank exhaustion will slow as the ambient pressure drops."
scuba,3dgjic,stds9tng,2,Thu Jul 16 07:21:47 2015 UTC,"but I question turning off the tank. That converts a potentially useless air supply (once it runs out) into an absolutely useless one (since its shut off).   If the tank is allowed to drain completely- you now have two problems- buoyancy and a lack of gas. Turning off the tank prevents the complete loss of gas and subsequent buoyancy swing. Furthermore- since the freeflow was almost certainly caused by freezing- turning off the gas stops the freeflow and allows the ice that formed to melt. Once the ice melts- the regulator will function correctly once again.   I wonder if a smoother course might be to breathe off the freeflowing reg, or switch to octo and kink the primary hose if poss, but even if not, start a normal ascent and watch the pressure guage constantly.   Have you ever actually tried this? You have bubbles everywhere. They're screwing up your visibility and trying to knock off your mask.  Besides which- many freeflows are caused by the first stage freezing up- so switching to the octo won't help.  In that case- watching the SPG ... with what hand? Depending on how you were taught you either need two hands to hold the reg (holding back the tabs) or one hand holding the reg half way out of the mouth and the other hand on the ascent line. You don't have a free hand to look at the SPG- even if you could see it through the cloud of bubbles.  Kinking the hose? Again- with what hand? Sure that might work in clear tropical waters with no current and if you are comfortable holding the reg with one hand and kinking the hose with the other. But then you have no hand free to hold the ascent line- and given the buoyancy swing- that's probably a good idea.  The truth is freeflows are a pain in the ass and divers rarely handle them well.  In any case- turning the air off and turning it back on again is, as I said, a more advanced topic and you need to be comfortable with it- but it will solve the problem."
scuba,3dgjic,CactusPete,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:33:22 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of freeflows, but I've never had one I was unable to solve in the water, and fairly quickly.  So I haven't had this situation.  But having some foreknowledge and a plan is a way to avoid a small incident becoming a big emergency.  If the first stage freezes up, wouldn't both the octo and primary be freeflowing? Obviously that undercuts my ""switch to octo"" plan.  I've only had 2nd stage issues.    I see your points but still question teaching anyone to turn off a functioning air source at depth.  An AL 80 is only about 6 pounds negative, I think, and having a few extra breaths seems worth that risk.  To me, the worst case is using the remaining air to get to 50 or 30 or 20 feet and if things go dry there, a free ascent is much more feasible - especially for a relatively new diver.   It worked out here, but here there was an experienced buddy with a pony.  As for mechanics, I think you could hold the reg in the right hand, and the ascent line (if any) and SPG in the left.  It might be necessary to pull the reg away to see the SPG, or to see the depth gauge/computer or ascent line to measure or control progress.  Despite the noise and bubble madness, even with both primary and octo freeflowing the key point, to me, is that for the moment you have 1) air and 2) time.  Not a lot of either, maybe, but enough to improve your situation.   Turning off your tank at depth just converts a potential out of air emergency into an actual one.  However, I think I'd agree that for an experienced diver with an experienced buddy, with a redundant second source, its no big deal to shut it down and switch.  I'd be concerned if two inexperienced divers get a freeflow at 80 feet and start turning off tanks.  Also, I have no idea if kinking a hose is even feasible.  I'm tempted to try it on an old hose.  It would work in theory, but might take two hands or simply not be feasible in water."
scuba,3dgjic,stds9tng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"I think, and having a few extra breaths seems worth that risk.   But the point is you're on your buddy's octo- shutting down the tank removes a distraction and could fix the problem. I'm not suggesting you do this on your own- and definitely not with an inexperienced diver.   I've had a lot of freeflows   ... Why?  I dive in cold (35 degree) water all the time and I've never had one- let alone had them all the time :) What regs are you using?"
scuba,3dgjic,CactusPete,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:43 2015 UTC,"Ha ha.  I think the answer is I've been diving for a very long time, and some of the older regs were a bit more freeflow prone.  I had an old Sherwood Magnum that loved to freeflow (and that reg as sufficiently, uh, vintage, that it probably bears no relation to the modern Sherwoods.  And freeflows right after a boat entry aren't that uncommon - I've had a few and seen more.  These are on the surface and so not a safety issue - more of an annoyance.  I've never had a ""frozen reg"" hard-core freeflow.    To me, shutting down a working though flawed breathing system is like flying a single engine plane over mountains, having an engine problem but still getting power, but shutting the engine down voluntarily.  It creates the emergency.  I do get that it can be different with two experienced divers and a redudant air supply - but I question how many divers really have training to actully share air in a real world situation.  Once, scuba classes lasted weeks or months and involved multple ocean dives.  Now, it seems like a weekend or so and they turn you loose.  I appreciate your input - as I noted, you never know what the next problem you encounter may be, and a little forethought can go a long way.  If you've thought about a scenario even a little, it can convert ""WTF"" into ""Ah, I've heard of this."""
scuba,3dgjic,stds9tng,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"And freeflows right after a boat entry aren't that uncommon   Ahh- that's really not the sort of freeflow we were discussing here. If you can stop the freeflow by detuning the reg or even just blocking the mouthpiece momentarily- that's not really something you need to worry about.  There is no reason for a regulator to start freeflowing in your mouth unless you're pointed into a strong current/flow, because of ice, or because of a mechanical malfunction. The first can be stopped by simply turning your head. The latter two are serious issues and need to be dealt with.   To me, shutting down a working though flawed breathing system is like flying a single engine plane over mountains, having an engine problem but still getting power, but shutting the engine down voluntarily.   And what if that compromised engine is wasting a ton of fuel you could be using in the other engine? What if all that wasted fuel starts causing a weight imbalance? What if it's causing significant vibrations that are making it impossible to read your instruments or otherwise compromises your ability to aviate? There are in fact plenty of cases where you might shut down a spinning but poorly functioning engine in a multi. Sorry- I have a CPL, MEL, IR :)   It creates the emergency.   I disagree- a serious freeflow at depth is already an emergency. The question is simply how to best handle the situation. There isn't always one right answer- different conditions may dictate different responses.   I do get that it can be different with two experienced divers and a redudant air supply - but I question how many divers really have training to actully share air in a real world situation. Once, scuba classes lasted weeks or months and involved multple ocean dives. Now, it seems like a weekend or so and they turn you loose.   I teach scuba classes every week and I can assure you- breathing off a freeflowing regulator is much much much much more difficult for students. They can share air and do an ascent. Few, if any, are capable of doing anything but breathing off the freeflowing regulator- let alone trying to maintain buoyancy then doing an ascent.  Think about an ascent... You need to hold the ascent line with one hand, and keep your other hand on your LPI so you can vent excess gas. Where is the third (or even fourth) hand to hold the freeflowing regulator open so you can breathe off it? Where is the fourth (or fifth) hand to check your SPG while this is going on?  If you go some place like Dutch Springs (or whatever the busy local training site for you is) you'll see the truth of what I'm saying. I've seen plenty of people make alternate air ascents- even new students. I've never seen one do a freeflowing regulator ascent at anywhere near an appropriate speed- even if they manage to not bolt."

If you haven't encountered it- then why weigh in on the problem? I've seen it multiple times (just never on my own regs which are environmentally sealed and cold water rated).   But my flying analogy was a single-engine scenario, where there is no other engine.   Apologies- I misread your post. Point is there are still cases where you might do that.   Which is the case here - that air bubbling out could either just head for the surface by itself or, possibly, give the diver a breath or two or ten.   Bubbling out? We're not talking about a leaking regulator, or even a slight flow. We're talking about taking your reg and pressing the purge button in as far as it will go and trying to breathe off it.   From 80 feet, an extra breath or two could make the difference - and if you're alone, or without a capable buddy, how do you even get your tank turned off?   You don't and I never said you should. This is an advanced exercise for a capable buddy.   Do you spend two minutes horsing around with that when you could instead make a controlled ascent and surface?   Not at all- and if you read my posts you'll see I said:  ""Your buddy did exactly what he should have- gave you his alternate/pony, tried for a few seconds to solve the problem, shut off your tank, and brought you to the surface.""  and:  ""A free flow is a serious issue and you definitely need to get to the surface quickly (but at a safe rate). Don't dawdle :)""  That said- once on the way up, and perhaps even at 15' if you have plenty of gas and have your head together- then you can try turning it back on to see if it was a freeze. The more experienced the team- the easier and deeper you can do it without concern.   Is there even a ""turn off my tank"" signal?   Nope- but again- an experienced buddy team can do this easily without asking.   having novice divers actually try to buddy breath   Nobody is talking about buddy breathing here.

But your experience is different.   Sure- which is why you shut down the tank and eliminate the torrent of bubbles. At that point- where's the issue?   Also, I admit I have no idea how possible it is to even breathe off a reg with a freeflowing first stage. Is the 2nd stage just vomiting air so it's like trying to drink from a firehose?   Yes- all the numbers and quotes we've been linking to in this thread are in reference to a real freeflow- think holding your purge button down as hard as you can and trying to breathe off it. If you're talking about some bubbles coming out of a regulator then we're having two different discussions. A few bubbles coming out of your reg is not a freeflow.  This is an example of the process:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH_NqKn-oFw  Freeflow with lots of bubbles and incredibly distracting. Shut down the tank to make the ascent easier.  This isn't a great video but it gives you some idea of how distracting a freeflow can be:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZy10ECH8cI&t=205s  There are a couple of shots in there where you can see how bad the bubbles are in the divers face. The force of the stream can knock off your mask, make it impossible to see your buddy, and is incredibly unnerving for a new diver."

scuba,3dgjic,reddit0rial,7,Thu Jul 16 07:21:56 2015 UTC,"Even if that exact situation came up, and there was no buddy around to help, the chances of you dying would still be quite remote. You should be trained as an ow diver to be able to breathe the free flow- and even if during your ascent your supply was to run out lets say at 50 feet... An emergency buoyant ascent would be reasonable recourse- you may have suffered some form of dcs needing some time in the chamber, but the chances of you dying I think would have been quite remote.  And yes... The deeper down you are the more air you would have lost due to the free flow. At 80 ft you would have been going through a little over 3 times the amount of air you would have lost at the surface."
scuba,3dgjic,avboden,3,Thu Jul 16 04:05:50 2015 UTC,Plus switching to his spare reg and kinking the primary's hose could give a lot more time for the ascent.

scuba,3dgjic,fooda,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:37 2015 UTC,"Free flow should stop when you close the tank. 1st and 2nd stage will still be under pressure, so no water should get inside. Even if water gets into the regs it´s no problem since you can easily dry them with compressed air. Only your pressure gauge will brake if you let water get in. So remove the gauge first."
scuba,3dgjic,wolfgangmob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:47:45 2015 UTC,"If the free flow is just IP creep then the 2nd stage should seal up when it drops low enough but if it, the 2nd stage, is broken or stuck open the air can completely drain out. If the air completely drains out and you get water inside the 1st stage you should have it completely taken apart and cleaned out properly, preferably sonic cleaner, especially if you were in salt water. If the 1st stage was flooded then everything attached to it needs to be checked."

Worst case you think ""Oh bother, those weights were expensive"" and drop your belt remembering to blow bubbles all the way up.  If you keep calm you are in no danger because you have learned all the things you need to know. This is also why we make such a big deal about going inside or underneath things."
scuba,3dgjic,falco_iii,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"A serious incident, but sounds like you both handled it well and were never close to dying.     First, assuming I stupidity stayed put, how much bottom time do you think I had left with a runaway and 2000 pounds?    Not sure, probably 1 - 3 minutes until empty.  This video shows 2 minutes with an o-ring failure. Its educational, and not all failures are equal  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXu4bdTZbAI  ... Notice how the PSI rockets down to 2000 in 7 seconds, 27 seconds to 1000 PSI, 57 seconds to 500 PSI and 2 minutes to empty.  They lost the first 1/3 of a tank in 7 seconds and the last 1/3 in 90 seconds.     Second, assuming I ascended on my own secondary (while still bleeding air from the runaway primary) would I have made it to the surface without my buddy? (It took four minutes to ascend. I’m assuming here that the efficiency of the runaway would have lessened as I ascended. At 80 feet I was bleeding air faster than I would throughout the shallower parts of the ascent, right?)   4 minutes is 20 ft/min, which is below the PADI recommended 60 ft/min maximum, or the ""local around here"" suggested maximum of 30 ft/min in normal circumstances.  As this is an emergency situation at the start of the dive (lower sat), I could see going from 80 to surface in 2 minutes at 40 ft/min... but that's me balancing air loss vs dcs risk."

Here are a list of options (more or less in order, although the exact order can be debated)   use your buddy's alternate use your buddy's pony feather your valve and breathe your own tank breath from your free flowing 2nd stage cesa buoyant ascent"
scuba,3dgjic,unclesandwicho,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"This is literally why breathing from a free flowing regulator is a skill in your open water course. You had two courses of action when your free flow started. Ascending at a normal rate of 30-60ft/min, stopping at 15 feet and conducting a safety stop until you have less than 200psi, than completing your ascent. Breathe from your free flowing regulator, don't waste the air that is already flowing from your reg by breathing from your octo. Your having an emergency event, it's not suppose to be comfortable. Since you went down to 80 feet, a 3 minute safety stop at 15 feet is proper safe diving practices considering how much of a crapshoot avoiding a DCI hit is, even if you follow a conservative profile. So if you were getting too low on air before your safety stop was complete, than you switch to your buddy's octo/pony. You should always save those for the very last option because when shit hits the fan, it's seldom one issue only.   The second option is immediately switching to your buddy's octo, not his pony bottle and he shuts down your valve. Ascend together to 50 feet, have your buddy slowly turn your valve back on. Usually, unless your rig is completely screwed, your reg shouldn't start free flowing again. At this point you may continue the dive if you or your buddy feel comfortable. Adjust your profile and keep it shallow. Or you can ascend to your safety stop and end the dive.   CESA's are literally the last option. Blowing past the recommended ascent rates are also not a safe or viable option. Most recreational DCI hits actually happen in the last 15-20 feet of your dive. If you're diving below 30 feet for longer than 20 minutes, conduct a safety stop. If you're diving below 60 feet for any length of time, conduct a safety stop. Pony Bottles should literally only be used in the event of serious gas emergencies. If you still have gas available in your primary gas supply, use it until it's exhausted, than switch to your emergency supply (pony). Do not use your pony bottle to extend your range. Get an actual stage bottle or consider taking technical training.   My goal is to improve all divers habits, I'm just giving tips to whoever wants to dive safer. If you have better tips feel free to add them or PM me so we can battle it out."
scuba,3dgjic,stds9tng,3,Thu Jul 16 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"Ascending at a normal rate of 30-60ft/min, stopping at 15 feet and conducting a safety stop until you have less than 200psi   If you can find me a single source that says this is a good idea I'll be shocked. If you have a freeflow- you get to the surface- you do not hang around at any depth until you have 200psi.  First off- 200PSI is ~5 cuft of gas assuming you breathe it down to 0 in an AL80. You're going to lose about ~5 cuft of gas in 15 seconds with a second stage freeflow between 15 feet and the surface. Thus- In order to get to the surface safely- you would need to do the last 15 feet in 15 seconds. In other words- at the point in your dive where you should be ascending at 30fpm or slower- you now have to ascend at 60fpm just to make it to the surface.  Second- your SPG may not even be that accurate. Do you want to be at 15' only to realize your SPG was wrong and you can't breathe? Now you are going to bolt.  Third- if you have a problem (get snagged on the line or something) you have no safety margin.  Fourth- If you do breathe your tank down to 200PSI- by the time you surface you're not going to have any air left to inflate your BCD. If conditions are shitty- do you want to be trying to do this orally? Hell- even if they aren't- do you want to be doing this while nervous after having a serious issue at depth?  Fifth- if conditions are shitty- wouldn't it be nice to have some air left to get back on the boat?  I'm all for conservative diving- but you do not do a safety stop during an emergency. Our tables are already much more conservative than they used to be- and there is no evidence they don't work. A lot of stuff we do (e.g. safety stops) have more to do with the fact that people are idiots and don't actually ascend at 30fpm (or even 60fpm)- especially in the last 15'- they get close and just race up the last few feet.  If you do correctly ascend at 30fpm all the way to the surface you'll be fine- and being on the surface without air is a much better idea than being at 15' without air.   At this point you may continue the dive if you or your buddy feel comfortable.   Why would you continue the dive after having an equipment malfunction? Maybe it was a freeze- or maybe it stuck/cracked/whatever. You do not know what caused the problem- get out of the water and get the gear checked. The rest of your post centers around being safe and conservative- continuing the dive after a problem is neither.   My goal is to improve all divers habits, I'm just giving tips to whoever wants to dive safer.   I'm sorry but your recommendation is not safer. Look at my numbers- it's actually much more dangerous."

scuba,3dgjic,unclesandwicho,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Ascent rates also used to be faster than 60ft a minute. Now 60ft is considered too fast. To be more conservative, finish every dive below 40 with a 3 minute safety stop. It's a good habit and good practices."
scuba,3dgjic,wagigkpn,2,Thu Jul 16 15:40:38 2015 UTC,Agreed on good habit and good practice but human physiology had not changed and the present rules/guidelines are very conservative....

scuba,3dgjic,unclesandwicho,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"People on a general basis have very different levels of susceptibility to DCI's. Some divers can do the exact same profiles at different times and have completely different physiological effects on their body.  The same goes for nitrogen narcosis. While someone could get narced at one depth the first day, they could be completely fine at a deeper depth on another day. Or vice versa.   Most modern decompression models are nothing but computer algorithms of what they think is correct. Most of the newest ones are not actually tested anymore. And if they are, they are tested on a very small pool of subjects.   Every dive is a decompression dive, the tables are a guideline only and not gospel."
scuba,3dgjic,wagigkpn,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Not every dive is a decompression dive if you are saying you need to do safety stops. Yes everyone reacts differently and that is why decompression tables (computers) are set to very conservative figures...so that EVERYONE who dives and adheres to those guidelines will not experience Decompression sickness. In addition, the old tables already were considered to be pretty conservative as well...I'm all for extra safety and this is a good thing! More knowledge is always a good thing. I am learning new things all the time...Typically, it is pretty hard to get DCS if you are diving a singl AL80...You just dont have the air supply to stay down long enough to build up nitrogen, unless you go really deep really fast. I dont ever dive below 60 feet and dont worry about decompression. The only worry i have is making sure i leave enough time between dives."

scuba,3dgjic,-hh,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a lot of the actual science of diving has gotten severely ""dumbed down"" and removed from training.   Article such as the above are part of the ""lawyering up"", which has its pedantic mantras that they hope that even an East Texas Jury will understand.  For DCS, the bottom line is as /u/wagigkpn/ pointed out:   the amount of actual Nitrogen on-gassing from only ~5 minutes at 80fsw profile is negligible, so there's pragmatically zero DCS risk as a consequence...even with a rapid ascent & skipped stop.  However, what's been missed entirely regarding risks is the elephant in the room:  the 'hasty' ascent increasing the risk of an AGE injury (""lung rupture"") from an overpressure due to an inadvertent breathhold during ascent.    Now do note that the way that the industry has avoided the AGE risk is through their beating the drum on the dangers of DCS, and the instituting of slow ascents and a deliberative 'safety' stop:  these actions mitigate both risks - - but the education is invariably 99% about DCS (if AGE is mentioned at all).    Case in point:  before my post, no one has even mentioned the AGE risk.  Given the choice on a Recreational dive profile, I'd much rather have DCS than take an AGE hit.  Because while DCS's hurt, AGE's kill.  And usually quite quickly.    -hh"
scuba,3dgjic,-hh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:41 2015 UTC,"... the tables are a guideline only and not gospel.   Not quite.  The Tables are based on Statistics, and while Statistics aren't deterministic, that doesn't mean that they're based on faith, either.  For example, winding the clock back 20 years to some NEDU research, we know that statistically, one can do a 60 minute duration (yes, I said one hour, not 40 minutes, or every 35) square dive to 80fsw, followed by a 60ft/min ascent straight to the surface with zero stops...and still have a 95% probability of walking away without being disabled by DCS.  Now will we have bagfuls of subclinical bubbling?  Yup, but that side effect was considered acceptable for the purpose/objectives of this particular research.  Ditto for the 'fatigue' which correlates to subclinical bubbling."

FYI, within the still-not-too-distant history of dive training, performing an actual ""ESA"" ascent to the surface (with zero stops) used to be one of the required demonstration skills for OW certification - - and way, way back in the old days (~35 years ago), these were done without an instructor escort.

The hole is not cold enough to free flow most regulators, so it's necessary to also be overbreathing it. Do you think you might have been doing this?

scuba,3dgg4h,simorq,6,Thu Jul 16 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"Reef health generally? Not good. Not good at all. Every place i've been back to after a few years has had more coral death, pretty much all over the world. Fish life is still good(area dependent) and the reefs are still awesome diving, but you'll be hard pressed to find any reef in the world that isn't declining.  Long term prognosis is a continued decline of the ocean's reefs, this we know and unfortunately aren't having very good luck stopping. That said, they're not going to just...die, they're going to change, those that evolve to the new ocean climate will proliferate and eventually replace all the old.   Current numbers show roughly 10% of the world's coral is already gone. Some places, such as the Philippines, its 70%+ dead.   Your question seems to be more about are places still worth diving, in that case, yes absolutely. Very few places are so bad that the diving is noticeably worse. There is tons of wonderful diving all over the world, don't worry about that part."

It was great -- you don't have to expend much energy swimming, and it was an absolutely gorgeous area. There was nothing particularly complex or technical about it... just that once you went by something, you couldn't turn around and swim back to see it again! It was one of my open water cert dives, so the dive master was with us and the group the entire time -- I'd definitely recommend doing that, as opposed to a dive where they just let you go and tell you to come back by some time (I don't even know if the second type would be an option with a drift dive)."

scuba,3deajd,StubbyK,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:18 2015 UTC,"I've gone on several drift dives off of Playa del Carmen. They are a blast. The bottom is flat and the water isn't very deep so updrafts or downdrafts aren't a problem. You just go flying along parallel to the shore. The divemasters and boat captains do it several times every day so they know exactly where and when you'll pop up and the boat will be waiting for the group there. Listen to the dive briefing and you'll have a great time. Just talking about it makes me want to go again. Don't drop anything, you won't be able to go back for it. By kicking as hard as I could upstream I could briefly stay stationary relative to the bottom, but I couldn't make any headway against the current. It kinda makes you feel like Superman. I've never moved as fast underwater as I did down there. I'm jealous."
scuba,3deajd,denaissance,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:31 2015 UTC,So I'm used to just wall dives with the abyss below me I guess so in my mind that's what I'm thinking we're going to be looking at but if it's flat bottomed I'm not as worried!  I got that from looking at some videos but reading that reassured me!  I can't wait to be drifting along.
scuba,3deajd,denaissance,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"The shallow dives have a bottom but they do drift on the wall in Cozumel. If you want to stay off the wall Tormentors, Yucab, Delilah, Cedro El Paso, and anything with shallow in the name are where you want to go."
scuba,3deajd,iissqrtneg1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:40:11 2015 UTC,What sort of depths do you get down to?
scuba,3deajd,McFeely_Smackup,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"20 to 40 feet, usually closer to 20 than 40. We left from Playa del Carmen and stayed pretty close to that side of the channel. We never went out so far that it wouldn't have been possible to swim back to shore. Obviously it would get deeper if you went farther out. We were not the only boat out there, there were probably three or four others. They all kept a polite distance between each other, but they all seemed to be diving in about the same depth range. One buddy team from our boat ended up surfacing with a group from a different boat. It obviously caused some concern, but apparently it happens often enough that have a procedure in place for sorting it out; be sure to take a good look at your boat before you get in the water.  I learned to dive in Lake Michigan and I do 90% of my diving there. The hardest part, for me, when moving to blue water is judging depth and distance. In Lake Michigan, if you can see something, that means it is less than 30 feet away. In the ocean you can see so much farther it can be confusing. I misjudged my depth and my distance to the group or my buddy several times. My depth estimates may be a little off because of that, and it is something to warn your wife about before her first time in the ocean."
scuba,3deajd,WikiHunt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll have to inform her this is a little different than the lakes she's dove.  I've only done dives in pools and the ocean so I don't know the lake feeling quite yet!
scuba,3deajd,texasguy911,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:00 2015 UTC,"Lake diving is just like ocean diving except everything is brown, grey, or green, and you can't see as far, and your depth gauge is like 5% off, and the bottoms are just sand and rocks. But no salt and no jellyfish!"
scuba,3deajd,texasguy911,2,Wed Jul 15 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"If you're going to the cozumel dive sites, they can be much deeper than 20 to 40 feet. The wreck dive is at 70 feet. Punta Sur is probably the most technically difficult dive with depths up to 100 feet and major down drifts (I've been diving in Cozumel 6 times and only one boat has agreed to take us to Punta Sur, the dive masters will only bring divers they feel are skilled enough after diving with them for a couple days).  That being said, there are plenty of shallow, awesome dives. A lot of boats start at Paradise reef as a check, super easy dive, low drift. But once you gain your bearings, drop down to 40 or 60 feet, get your buoyancy neutral, and enjoy the trip. Some dives you can drift a mile or more!  You shouldn't have any trouble, even as a new diver, on the easier dives in Cozumel, just make sure you and your partner have safety sausages just in case!   And if you're staying closer to playa, there can be some pretty intense surge, so stay very aware of your surroundings as you bob back and forth by the command of the ocean :)  Edit: http://www.divecozumel.net/divesites.html Looks like the wreck is only at 40ft...

It was some of the best diving I've done anywhere as far as sealife goes.    Drift diving is a challenge for shore entry and exit, for a pro guided boat dive, it's really not much different from any other dive.  The only frustrating thing I found was at one point we ran across an eagle ray rolling and eating a conch, unbelievably cool..but the current was too strong to hold in place to watch."

Like you I was a bit concerned about the current, but after experiencing it, we were fine.  Our guide caught a lionfish on one dive and fed it to a grouper on the next, it was pretty slick.  The only other comment I would make is I'm an air hog.  And with drift diving I can't surface before the rest of the group like I can on a dive where the boat is anchored.  This meant there were a couple occasions where the guide had me buddy breath with him so I could make it to the end of the dive without forcing the entire group to surface."

Probably the most difficult is to stay with the group. Sometimes a group comes together and looks at something, you need to wait for them in current. Thus, you drop down and hold on to something."

scuba,3deajd,Chrisisawarmgun,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Well, you go down to the very bottom, if you can, hide behind some rock or reef. With tips of your fingers hold on to some rocky part of the very bottom, head first into the current. Try to stay as low as possible, like a low-rider car. This will lessen ability of current to push you away.  Then, when you'll see your group floating your way (you can always estimate where current will push them - so you can be on that imaginary line), at some point you let go and go up to their level, maybe like 5-10 feet up.  Sometimes there is not much to hide behind of anything. Just stay as low as you can. Granted, choose parts that are not alive."

scuba,3deajd,bassfetish,2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of the people here. I've been to Cozumel about 15 times with ~80 dives there. Drift dives can be pretty easy. Most of the swifter current is in the flat, shallow dives. Important things to remember:   When drift diving on the wall good buoyancy is key. Watch your depth! The water is so clear you can easily find yourself going deeper than you intended. Stay behind the group leader. These guys do 4 or more dives a day so they aren't going to kick a lot. If you find yourself in front of the group don't try to swim back. Find a coral head to swim behind and they will catch up. Don't take a camera. With your experience level a camera is a distraction you doing need. And often times by the time you see something cool to shoot it's behind you.  Take an inflatable dive buoy ( dive sausage) and learn the name of your boat. If you have to come up early inflate your buoy and when a boat (there are lots of boats out there so watch your ascent) comes by tell them the name of your boat and they will radio them.    Overall Cozumel is lazy man diving. No navigation skills required. If you can stay neutral and do a safety stop you will be fine. I'm going back to Cozumel twice this year after not being there for a couple years. I always have a good time."

scuba,3dg1q4,ewanvt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think the ""color screen"" computers will hold less value in the future as this specific feature will be wildly improved upon. Readability in high sun, energy efficiency, size, resolution, etc.  Tech geared computers will have more value than recreation geared ones.  I'd probably get Petrel 2. It is not air integrated but very popular. It also doesn't need batteries recharged as often as the computer you are looking at. Thus, less chance diving with almost dead battery. Petrel also takes some non-rechargeable battery that is good for many-many dives and only like $5. https://www.shearwater.com/products/petrel-2/  Here is another company that has some popularity. I think, I think, some of their models do come air integrated: http://seabear-diving.com/h3  I have air integrated Oceanic VT4. I bought that one instead of Mares Icon HD because it had LED screen. Yeah, I got it for its non-color screen (LED vs LCD). Change battery like once a year if you dive often. I found that air integration is convenient but not that big of a deal. Today, if I were to buy a new computer, I'd get the best non-air integrated one I can find. That Petrel 2 from above, I was eyeing it for some time. Popular with good reviews.   I was also looking at Mares Icon HD a few years ago. Through reading forums and such, for some reason, this computer was never popular. Always available but no one talked about it as if no one ever had it, it was odd. Not sure what is wrong with Mares Icon HD but I did not find any following. Not sure if there is a good reason. The only thing that was on my mind, Mares Icon HD since to use old LCD tech that might be hard to see when sun is shining bright, like your cell phone screen when sun as its brightest, only this comp has worse LCD than nowadays cell phones, think early android phones. That is why I got myself LED computer when LCD tech on dive computers was a new thing.  For air gauge I'd recommend to get these (available from other sellers as well):  Hose: http://www.scubatoys.com/store/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=MiflexHighPressurehose  Gauge: http://www.caveadventurers.com/hog-spg-1-5-inch.html (with black face, helps when night diving)  The hose is very thin, light. The gauge is only 1.5"" across, also, very small and light. With this setup it feels like it is almost wireless. ;) Weights nothing."
scuba,3dg1q4,texasguy911,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's good insight.  I really like the Petrel 2... but air integration seems really useful. Then again, I'm an absolute novice ;)"
scuba,3dg1q4,texasguy911,2,Thu Jul 16 13:02:41 2015 UTC,"Even with air integration you STILL need a wired gauge. That is, if connection or battery fails, you need to know how long you can be alive for.  Thus, even with my air integrated setup, I have that thin hose with a small gauge. I put a peice of bungie around lower part of the tank. Then I take the HP hose and make a u-turn near the end of the tank where I tuck that loop in under the bungie. If my air integration fails, I can reach with my arm to the butt of the tank where the bungie is holding the HP hose with the gauge, then pull on the guage and the hose would come free of bungie.  This setup allows to have a backup without clipping the gauge to yourself. Kind of, have a hose but it is not in a way, it goes along the tank, very close to the tank, hard to snag by accident.  Also, my buddy can hover over me and look at my air pressure gauge without disturbing me.    Also, if you get wireless transmitter, don't put it in directly into your 1st stage. Buy a thick rubber 6"" high pressure hose ($20). First, it helps to be closer to your wrist for best wireless connection. Second, and most important, no one would think then to use your transmitter as a handle. It has been reported, some people who try to help you get on the boat sometimes will look what they can grab onto to get a grip of you. The hose will provide a look that it is NOT a handle to touch. Also, some people who travel to Mexico and such and have scuba operators setup their gear, have reported that their air integrated device was used as a handle to move their gear around. Thus, putting it on a very short hose saves you from such barbarism."

EDIT: Highland Cottage, and one night at the Tobermory Hotel. Both good places, preferred the Highland Cottage even though it's a bit off the water.  Also! If you're going to be in the north of Scotland anyway and haven't been there, Scapa Flow (in Orkney) is fabulous. It's the site of 52 wrecks from the scuttled German High Seas Fleet.

scuba,3dbbnx,flavorizante,2,Wed Jul 15 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Guanabara Bay is polluted and probably not so nice for diving. I don't know about the islands off shore. I've dived at Ilha Grande, which has some nice spots. The island is a nature preserve and the ocean side has a marine/dive park. Weather is an issue, so check because the waves can make the ocean side problematic. Vis on the land side varies. I would suggest looking at Buzios. I have been there, but not dived there. It's about the same travel time from Rio in the other direction and I've heard some good things about it."

For basic/simple things, I would say spring straps on any set of fins I own and Trilobite Eezycut line cutters which I have installed on my harness and computer.  Probably based on that fact that I spent a lot of money on it, my favorite thing would be my rEvo II Mini rebreather.  It's a great rebreather and travels very friendly.  Other runner ups...  DUI FLX Extreme Drysuit - It's cut perfectly for me, flexibility is awesome.  I own other drysuits but this one fits me the best.  KUBI Dry Gloves - Simply one of the best dry glove systems I've used. Similar to old Diving Concept Rings. They attach to any suit easily.  Light Monkey 35W HID Can Light  - A seriously bright light which is great for New England wreck diving.  Shearwater Petrel - One of best computers on the market. Easy to read screen, bluetooth, AA battery and fantastic customer service and support."

scuba,3d9vqz,stds9tng,6,Tue Jul 14 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"I wish there was just one thing. I have a bunch of products that stand out in my mind- at least in terms of just being beautifully designed and manufactured:  Shearwater Petrel computer - Could stand to be a little lower profile but it's perfect otherwise.  Trilobite Eezycut - Simple, elegant, inexpensive.  Carter lift bags and DSMB - They make 10,000lb industrial lift bags. Their personal ones are just as well built.  Light Monkey reels - Beautifully designed and perfectly manufactured.  Sola Tech 600 light - Small, powerful, and gives you a 12 hour burn time on low. I'd rather have two of these than one of my big canister lights- and given the size and cost- I do!  Faber LP85 tanks - Perfection in a tank. 85 is plenty for a reef. Double 85's is great for a serious wreck. Pump them up to 3k and you get 97 cuft of gas each- not bad for a stroll in the caves. Pump them up to 3800 and you get 120cuft. Just the right physical size as well- they balance perfectly on almost everyone."

(CAD)   Dunno- that depends on the diving you intend to do. For cave/wreck use- the burn time is key. The 800 on low is 280 minutes. The Tech 600 on low is 720 minutes. Also- the Tech 600 lists for $599 USD and the 800 lists for $399 USD so only a $200 USD difference here.  For me- the Tech 600 is a no brainer."
scuba,3d9vqz,stds9tng,2,Tue Jul 14 17:54:14 2015 UTC,It says that the tech 600 has a BCD attachment. Does it attach in a way that it can be used while attached to you or is it just a clip as to when not in use?  My type of diving may have a few night dives a month but caves would only be 2/3 times a year.

There's no retractor or anything like that.   My type of diving may have a few night dives a month but caves would only be 2/3 times a year.   So what light do you use when cave diving now? How long are your dives? Are you full cave, stage cave, rebreather cave? All of that will factor into your choice."

Even though cage diving might be relatively safe from the sharks, you could still get your reg knocked out, or panic and cause yourself problems.  IMO, you should have some experience first so you know you won't panic, and that if something happens, you're prepared to deal with it.  Just curious, are the cages single person, or do they generally go in a group?  If with a group and the group includes a dive master, I might consider it a little safer for a new diver."
scuba,3darki,runsongas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"most of the cage dives aren't on scuba. hookah systems are more common so you won't need to get certified. you should definitely do some freediving or a discover class to gauge your comfort level underwater before going.  if you are scared of sharks, you should probably skip it because you do not want to panic underwater."
scuba,3darki,CanadianDiver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:14 2015 UTC,I would do it open water... the cage seems a bit of a let down.

The whole operation was extremely professional and they did a great job. Half of my group was scuba certified but new to diving, I was an introductory diver and we had 1 snorkeler. It was great having a group that gave everyone a great experience."

That's like being in New York and looking for a day trip to Key West.  You want to head up to Cairns, Port Douglas or Airlie Beach, there are hundreds of dive operators running day trips from those locations."
scuba,3db1wt,thumb0,2,Wed Jul 15 07:54:06 2015 UTC,I got certified with Deep Sea Diver's Den in Cairns.  They do liveaboards and day trips.  I was very happy with them and we dove some really nice sites.
scuba,3db1wt,MyFavouriteName,2,Wed Jul 15 21:22:43 2015 UTC,"I can second this. Deep Sea Diver's Den are the crew I got my certification with. They are awesome.   If you've got time in your schedule, or can make time, I highly recommend their 5 day OW course:  http://www.diversden.com.au/ow5day.htm  It's two days in the class and pool, and then three days on their massive live-aboard catamaran. It was incredible value and still seems to be."
scuba,3db1wt,thumb0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did the same live aboard course and it was an amazing way to get into diving.  You'll never forget it, and it'll be hard not to get hooked. The only problem is that you'll be spoiled for your future dives ;)"
scuba,3db1wt,MyFavouriteName,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:56 2015 UTC,Ha! So true. I'm always concerned that future live-aboards won't meet my (probably high) expectations because of that few days on the Ocean Quest.
scuba,3db1wt,onemanpony,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:15 2015 UTC,"I dived the reef from Cairns years ago, and I'm sure there are spectacular spots, I honestly felt underwhelmed and have been spoiled with a lot of fantastic and remote reef to dive and snorkel on in my life. My advice as a tourist in your shoes is definitely to continue doing your research, of course you want to dive the barrier reef given the chance, but there is plenty of coastline around queensland, and I've enjoyed some good snorkeling on the reefs around the Whitsunday Islands (off the coast of Queensland, accessible from Airlie Beach)."
scuba,3db1wt,OnlyCoolGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"Alternatively if you want to dive a little closer to Sidney you go to dive with the south west rocks dive center in in the fish rock dive spot, which is one of the top 10 dives I'm Australia. You can get to it be train from Sidney and the guys from.the shop pick you up.in the station, they have their own accommodation and are super friendly. Spend 5 days diving there with accommodation and breakfast and paid only 500 bucks.  This week I'll be doing a 7 day liveaboard of Townsville to dive the Yongala and the GBR."
scuba,3d6mxx,SpaceFeline,12,Mon Jul 13 22:56:18 2015 UTC,I'm an archaeologist.  Where did you find this?  You're probably going to want to contact whoever would be in charge of cultural resources for that area.
scuba,3d6mxx,Thjoth,6,Tue Jul 14 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"Seconded by a second archaeologist. Also, it's a good idea to contact the local cultural resources office and report the find without collecting the item. Artefacts lose their informational value when taken out of their context."
scuba,3d6mxx,LackTheWitForFunnySN,8,Tue Jul 14 06:50:00 2015 UTC,"I figured since he's got it out of the water he's already done that damage so just didn't bring it up, but yeah.  The artifacts themselves are rarely special, but the way they're placed on the seabed or around the site is what gives us all the archaeological information we need.  Since you've already moved it, you've already destroyed probably 99% of its archaeological value.  Then again, this thing could be a modern clay Buddha head that got dumped there or something.  I'm not an East Asian archaeologist so I don't know, and that's exactly why you should contact a cultural resource office.  Also if you have a GPS tag for where you picked it up, that would be excellent."
scuba,3d6mxx,Thjoth,8,Tue Jul 14 06:57:04 2015 UTC,"It was at a tourist spot in CA, I highly doubt that this is an archeological find rather than a local artist or the local buddhist monk doing a ceremony of sorts. If I were diving anywhere remotely near where I think I would find some historical artifacts I wouldn't just take them. Please do not assume."
scuba,3d6mxx,LackTheWitForFunnySN,5,Tue Jul 14 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"That's true. Also, OP, you'll need to soak the object in fresh water for about three or four weeks, changing the water every few days. This will remove the salts which have been absorbed by the object. If you don't do this the salts will crystallize in the clay and cause the object to break apart."

scuba,3da7c9,melcrawmeow,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"This might not exactly answer your question, but I live in South Florida. Broward, the county above Miami, has probably more dive spot options for you than Miami. If you don't mind driving a bit further north, a dive shop I have taken a trip with, called Dixie Divers, has a lot of options for day trips from their boat. There's tons of other shops too.   Check the South Florida Groupon/LivingSocial for dive trips too, there are almost always things available. I hope you're able to get certified before coming down, but if not, snorkeling down here is great too! I recommend Lauderdale by the Sea/Commercial Pier for snorkeling or diving! You can swim right from the beach, just one pier length, and there's a beautiful reef that I always enjoy. In fact, I'm not OW certified yet either, and I go snorkeling there often :) Good luck!"
scuba,3da7c9,melcrawmeow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"How far away is Broward from Miami? We're not planning on renting a car so is there a convenient bus from the two areas?  Thanks for the tips. So since you're not OW certified, can you still dive in OW with an instructor or with a group?"
scuba,3da7c9,melcrawmeow,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you go in Broward and where you're staying in Miami. The counties are next to each other, but Miami is large so if you'll be in South Miami, it would take you some time. I don't use the buses so I'm not much help in that department =\   Also, I said I have gone snorkeling only thus far, though there are plenty of places that offer a ""discovery dive"" for non-certified people that includes a short instruction class and pool dive before they take you out on a very supervised dive. If you need to stay in Miami then map out some dive shops around where you'll be staying and see what they offer."
scuba,3da7c9,idriveamusclecar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh really? Hmm, that sounds really interesting.   Have you heard much about these discovery dives? Would you say they're worth it? Can anyone just join in on these, even if they've never touched scuba gear in their lives?"
scuba,3da7c9,texasguy911,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"I was on a snorkeling trip that also had a group of people doing the discovery dive. They can be pretty pricy at some places, so I can't say whether or not they're worth it because I've never done it. I only did one in a pool to get a feel for it, which made me take the jump to purchase a certification course that I'm in the process of getting started with. That being said, everyone on the trip seemed to have really enjoyed themselves. And yes, the point of them is that you've never dived before and want to see how it feels before you decide whether or not to get certified."
scuba,3da7c9,texasguy911,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:09:42 2015 UTC,Ahhh okay. Well I think that's what I'll have to end up doing just because getting the OW certification would take too long :/
scuba,3da7c9,texasguy911,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:32 2015 UTC,Check out the Blue Lagoon and Texan Scuba. You do the coursework online and all the dives in one weekend to become open water certified. I got certified with them in April and it's been a great experience! Ask for Sheila.
scuba,3da7c9,idriveamusclecar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"Galveston doesn't matter. Cannot dive there anyway (maybe from Freeport like 2-3 hours away by boat where waters start to become transparent). Your prior CPR and First Aid doesn't matter for the first class or the second level. Only needed for the 3rd level, by then, you'll have to take 'em all over again.  Your nearest diving spot is  ""Mammoth Lake"" on 288 in freeport, ""Twin lake"" 288 & hw6, and ""lake 288"" near hw8 & 288.  There are 2 options for you here:  1) Finish cert in Houston, 2 weekends (if won't rain). Or have a custom class that will do it in 3-4 days.  2) Take tests in Houston and get a referral to do actual dives in Miami with some other scuba school under the same curriculum (like PADI or SSI), it is done often so, people go to vacation and finish dives in beautiful water. Houston lake water is almost opaque (ocean near shore is 100% opaque), if you'll get 8 feet of visibility, it is your lucky day in the lakes when taking classes. If you can, take class in ""Blue Lagoon"" in Huntsville, water there at least is good looking, high acidity kills bacteria, thus, waters look more transparent.  I'd finish here in Houston as 2 days is way too short in Miami, in case of bad weather and such, to finish it there.  Google ""b&w dive"", they will cert you ASAP on your own schedule, they are in Chanelview but they teach at ""lake 288"". Small family dive shop/instruction, they are most flexible, and a good looking girl is the instructor.  Big shops are Maximum scuba, Giggling Marlin, and Sea Sports scuba. Though, their class sizes are like 8+ people. While it can be fun (I see them always laugh and banter when students rest on waters), however, you are just a number there. With a smaller school it is like 2-3 people size class, sometimes one-on-one for no special price. I feel like one would get better instruction in a smaller class setting, plus, safer.   When registering for classes, FORCE them to give you a total price (say, if I'll be a perfect student and will not require extra tutoring). It is bullshit if they cannot, they do it weekly, they know every price and what you'll need. This is because the class can require additional $$$ to the class price. Say they tell you that class is $299. Ask, if books are included. If not, how much. Ask how much is for lake entry (lakes are private by third parties, require entrance fee like $15-$20 a day, you might need 2 days). Ask if rental gear is included. Usually they will require you to have a proper mask, snorkel, fins. They will be happy to sell it to you for a big margin. Get it some place else, don't get what they sell, it is the gear they make most money on, not a good choice maybe for you in the long run. The rental scuba gear is usually free for pool sessions (not including mask, snorkel, fins that you should own). When you go to the lake, they will try to sell you gear. DO NOT BUY! Always ask about renting, they all do. It is about $60/day probably max, most places can be $15, $30 a day, you may need 2 days worth of that. Ask if there will be other fees and what they are. Ask how much is extra for extra tutoring, class make up, canceling out on a class (in case you got to work). Come out with numbers in hand before committing, see if you can afford a sum of all those numbers. Politely decline any scuba gear purchase with the saying: ""Sorry, scuba gear choices are so vast, I am not sure yet what I like, I'd like to try a lot of rentals before I commit."" All divers make the same mistake, their first gear is a throw away because they bought what they later find improper for their kind of diving. Your tastes mature VERY quickly and every 6 months they may shift. Don't be caught with a scuba gear you hate and hard to sell, because it is, there will be a lot of similar gear people will be getting rid of for same reasons.  PS: Bad weather can really f-k up plans. There you are all ready and willing by rain won't go away.

What's the shortest possible amount of time that I could finish getting certified? Do you think I could do it in a day or two?   If you don't mind me asking, where did you get certified? And since you also seem to be from Houston, what do you think is a good price for dive instruction in the area?"
scuba,3da7c9,texasguy911,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:35 2015 UTC,"I got certified in B&W dive co, my open waters and advanced, the rest I took at Giggling Marlin, my solo cert and rescue.  I don't know an exact answer to how quickly, I'd assume 3 days, but you call the shop as they will be able to tell you exactly. All I know is that big shops have a schedule and they don't like anything that doesn't fit their own schedule.  Price is about $300. It can go lower but it is only because like airlines, they still get you on ""carry on"" fees. Thus, the price might look cheaper but it is only because they removed something that other school includes for free. Thus, see my original post, I edited, it talks about extra costs that are not a part of a class.  Example: some schools will charge you for AIR in the tanks. $8 a day. Some will not. 4 days of $8 is $30+ extra for them, you see? Scuba instruction is another nickel and dime industry."
scuba,3da7c9,texasguy911,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:59:42 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. I think I'll definitely squeeze in the class before I head off to Miami then. Is the Open Water certification the easiest one to get and the most basic one? I'd certainly be interested in getting the others but I don't have much time before I leave for Miami and as of now all I want to do is be able to dive.
scuba,3d9f6v,melcrawmeow,7,Tue Jul 14 15:13:12 2015 UTC,Found out my OW Cert will be SDI when I thought it was SSI   If I can be completely blunt- it doesn't matter in the slightest.  SDI is a good agency (TDI is their sister agency and they are highly respected) but open water training is mostly about whatever the absolute minimum the agencies can get away with. The specific instructor will matter a lot more than the agency they teach for.  Regardless of what the class is supposed to cover- most instructors will go over dive tables with you if you ask. Even if they don't- dive tables are dirt simple to use and you can find plenty of videos explaining their use:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRzxm0DBTAA  Think of the OW certification as more of a license to learn. It's meant to teach you the bare minimum you need so as not to kill yourself- but that's about it. A good instructor will go well beyond that- but they're not always easy to find.

You won't need a dive comp right after cert as your DM's on trips will always have one but it is something I think is a vital early purchase.    Take your course seriously, make sure you really read the books, think about the theory, don't rush the skills.  At the end of the day all the major agencies don't have massive differences, your goal should just be to be a sponge and soak up everything you can learn and then practice it over and over.    I am sure you could find some way to teach yourself dive tables with the help of google and this sub."

The only time it might be a problem to have OW in SDI and, say, AOW in PADI is when you'll want to be a dive master for any of these, they'd require all same agency certs, I was told..."
scuba,3d9f6v,malicart,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"This has been stated many, many times before but the certification agency does not matter in the slightest.  It's all about having a good quality instructor.   Choose the instructor, not the agency.  Having said that, there are good and bad instructors for almost every agency.  Pretty much all recreational scuba agencies teach to same standards for basic open water courses.  There is an organization called WRSTC (World Recreational Scuba Training Council) that PADI, PDCI, SDI, SSI and IDEA are all part of.  Even if the agency (NAUI, for example) is not part of WRSTC, they all essentially teach to the same basic standards or to a higher standard.  Don't worry about it and have fun in your class.  Rent a computer (and learn how to use it) or learn to use basic set of tables initially and you'll be fine."

It's just that when people made a huge deal about it in the 90s and scientists were like ALARM ALARM, it got swept under the rug. Then a photo was printed in the LA Times and national outcry and local outcry was os heavy they were forced to agree to shut down the outfalls.  Everyone was happy and no longer having to yell. SO when it came time for shut down, the municipalities and state looked around and no one was yelling so they requested an extension, and another and another and now they are slated to shut down in 2023 or later. They should've been shut down years ago.   So unless people start getting loud and offering up alternatives they are willing to pay for (deep well is affordable but causes similar issues, advanced waste water treatment and artificial ecosystems like wetlands are the key, but can be costly. )   The Cities, COunties and State need to work together to save the reefs of Florida.   Look up the everglades, runoff, sharks bay, big sugar and the draining of lake okeechobee.   Lots of info there on where more heavy nutrient loading is coming from and causing harmful algae blooms in the indian river, the west coast of FL, the keys and the everglades themselves.  It's crazy.  We are doing the same thing to FL springs with agriculture, water pumping permits, big box stores paved over high flow cave systems and much more.   Too many Nitrates in the water.   Look up Brian Lapointe. THere are articles about how FL politicans used bad science to say that there was no nitrate problem. That there was a ""Salinity"" issue int he keys and they fix was adding more fresh water from the lake and big sugar.  Lots of dead zones."

This subject has generated much discussion worldwide, and many physicians hold opposing viewpoints. Perhaps the most liberal guidelines are from the United Kingdom, which states that well-controlled asthmatics may dive - within two guidelines:  Provided they have not needed a bronchodilator within 48 hours; and if they do not have cold-, exercise- or emotion-induced asthma. In Australia, the most conservative country in this respect, all divers are expected to pass a spirometry (lung function) test, to exclude asthma, prior to certification.""  Alert Diver article about smoking, asthma, and diving  Look, I know many people who dive with various conditions that some would say should preclude diving, like diabetes, asthma, smoking, etc., but I think it's sort of up to you to determine if you're fit to do it. Some people won't let anything stop them. I think that your friend should think about how much they want to do this. Not sure what ""moderate to severe"" asthma is -- you mean, she's gone to hospital and been put on a nebulizer, etc.? Or sort of starts wheezing when she is around allergens, runs, etc.?   edit: not sure why I can't get the links to work right, but you should be able to still follow them...  Edit2: Keep in mind that the gas from an open circuit system (i.e., regulator attached to cylinder) tends to be very dry. If your friend has a problem with dry air, that would definitely be a problem then."

Seeing someone die doing something you love messes with your head for a long time and drives some to give up the sport completely.  I have been adjacent to a fatality and it still fucks up my head when I talk about it.  There are only a few contraindications to diving and active asthma is one of them. If there is a chance that physical exertion can bring on an attack, then honestly I am sorry to say that diving is not for you."

That being said I have never had an attack in my adult life and spend about an hour a day doing hard exercise.   I suppose the hard and fast rule would exclude me, but I know that as long as I take my long acting inhalers regularly and keep my exercise levels up that I will not have any issues.   I of course talked to my doctor about it before diving and he basically told me to use my discretion on the matter."

scuba,3d6gld,CanadianDiver,3,Tue Jul 14 05:05:13 2015 UTC,This thread actually brought me to the same conclusion. I am going to go back in to see a specialist and figure out if I really need the meds.
scuba,3d6gld,carbonnanotube,2,Tue Jul 14 10:21:02 2015 UTC,"Has anyone ever managed to scuba dive with their asthma? Any recommendations for what she can do?   I have asthma and am certified. But my case (like everyone's) is unique. Among other reasons why I was able to get certified is that my asthma is well controlled and I've never had a severe asthma attack. Even at it's worst I am still able to breathe decently.   The process for getting my doctor to sign off is going to take a bit of work (or it did on my end). As I recall, I saw my primary doctor who wouldn't sign off until I saw a first specialist where I did a bunch of breathing/lung tests...and then I was referred to a second specialist where I did a bunch of more test including stress tests (One of the test they had me do was to see how far I could be stressed WITHOUT any medications and how well I could breathe during an induced attack), After all of my numbers came back more or less decent enough....my primary doctor again signed off with the requirement that I need to start taking a inhaled steroid (e.g., flowvent or similar) several days before my trip. I also need to use my rescue inhaler before I dive (and between dives if going more than once) and I have one of those breathe flow rate meters that measures how fast/strong you do a burst of air...and if my numbers are below (like 700 unit-things, which is near the top of the scale...I am highly, highly, highly, encouraged not to dive).   Additionally, I tend to keep my dives shallow... I have been on few 100ft dives, but generally I tend to keep thing 60ft or less. And things like tec diving, cave diving, doubles, deep diving, decompression dives, etc are all off the table.   But the thing to remember is how long it will (theoretically) take to get from where you are underwater to your/her inhaler. I know that there is a certain risk (above and beyond general risks associated with scuba), but that those risks are fairly small in my case. I am confident that even if an asthma attack were to happen and I was 100 feet underwater...I would be able to get back safely. While it would be rather unpleasant/stresful, I am confident I could breath well enough to get back to the surface and to my rescue inhaler.  As I said previously, even at its worst, I can still function.   Recap..lots of hoops for mild, well controlled asthma. Serious risk involved that need to be weighed.    All that said...""moderate to severe"" asthma makes me think diving probably isn't right for her."
scuba,3d6gld,throwaw867530nine,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"Has anyone ever managed to scuba dive with their asthma?   There are people who dive with allergen-induced asthma. For example, if you're allergic to cats, there is probably no cat hair in your tank.  OTOH, if you're allergic to mold, there's mold in lots of places in SCUBA, and diving would be a really bad idea.  The same goes for exercise induced asthma. It's just a really bad idea.  The risk runs from ""might be OK"" to ""yer gonna die!"" and is something your friend will have to discuss with her doctor; however at the end of the day, even if the doc says ""OK"", your friend still has to weigh the risks and determine if she's willing to accept them.  A severe asthma attack underwater is pretty much a death sentence because it prevents the normal gas exchange, and on ascent, turns the lungs into frothing fizzy bags of horrible bloody death."
scuba,3d6gld,none_shall_pass,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:21:05 2015 UTC,I think the risk is more one of AGE or other injuries related to gas trapped in the lungs that cannot be released due to constriction from the asthma attack.

scuba,3d6gld,scuba-marketing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:30:22 2015 UTC,"I have severe asthma, as in using a preventative daily (symbicort), using a rescue inhaler probably twice a week, and using my nebulizer probably twice a month. My asthma is both allergen and exercise induced, however I have never had a problem diving. I always have an inhaler with my gear on the boat, so worst case is I'm having an attack for like 20 mins before I get to the top, which is manageable. If you've had asthma all your life and you don't freak out when you have an attack and can keep your breathing controlled I think you're fine. I don't find diving strenuous at all, and in fact I find it very soothing as far as breathing goes.   I can't say for your friend, but if she knows her self and how she reacts during an attack then she can make the call."

Go to a specialist and get checked out, most courses will require a waiver from a doctor before enrolling an asthmatic for obvious reasons. Personally, breathing the compressed filtered air and the fact diving is one big breathing exercise was great for my asthma.  While asthma attacks start as a physical reaction, a lot of the escalation is driven by panic and lack of control, I found that diving really helped me stay calm.  My own experience."

Sometimes color can be more irreplaceablly lost at this point. Other than that, bring a white card on your dives and take a picture every 10 feet of depth to give different white balance reference points"

scuba,3d5k4o,Jim3535,2,Mon Jul 13 20:03:38 2015 UTC,Good high-lumens lighting is better than filters. If you filter at depth or with limited viz the altered and reduced spectrum will produce not-as-great results.
scuba,3d5k4o,flymol0,2,Tue Jul 14 03:46:20 2015 UTC,"1) No, not all filters are created equal.  Plastic ones can scratch easily, glass ones can crack, hinges can break.  I've used and seen a lot of different filters get damaged or broken.  I've also owned a few different types by different brands over the years.  2) Super cheap filters tend to break very easily and/or be very low quality.  Here are some things to look for in filters:   Easily removable underwater.  You don't want to use it at all depths, so it should be easy to take off and attach underwater. No weak points, especially joints or clips.  Try to find one that looks and feels durable and will take some abuse. Filters that come off and attach by a string or tether can be annoying since the string can float into the video.  Flip away designs are better in this respect. Glass is less scratch prone than plastic, but can crack, which I have seen.  Covers can help protect the filter. There are different colors available depending on the color of the water you are going to dive in. Once you go deep enough, video lights are much better than any filter for close up corals and stuff. When diving, check the filter and lens for air bubbles sticking to it periodically.  Especially after you swim through another diver's bubbles."

scuba,3d4tr0,czechm8e,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see how chumming = petting zoo.  While we utilize chum to attract, and in some cases, feed sharks, guests follow strict protocols during the dives.  None of the divers are petting sharks.  Shark ecotourism in the Bahamas directly led to the establishment of the shark sanctuary back in 2011."

Was that wall dive Ras Muhammed? LOVE that place!   Get yourself a red filter, it makes a WORLD of difference. Here's a screenshot from my dive buddy's red filter on the hero3 of me in the red sea. http://imgur.com/gallery/iuPpEqs"
scuba,3d50p5,Voicy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes it was my first time to the red sea. Usually I dive in the UK which has very low visibility so the red sea made quite a nice change!   The time-lapse was done with a go pro hero 4. It has a night-lapse feature for low light conditions. The footage I used was from out in the middle of the sinai wilderness where there is virtually no light pollution.   The film has afew different places in it. There is some footage from Yolanda reef but the majority of it was from around Dahab. Most of the footage there is from around the Blue hole, The Canyon, Mashraba bay in Dahab and Golden Blocks. All of which were fantastic dives. We also did the Thistlegorm which is my favourite dive to date.  Great picture! I see what you mean! I did experiment with a red filter but it was too strong and gave all the footage I took a red tint. I'm thinking of replacing it. One of my friends recommended this:"
scuba,3d50p5,Voicy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:12:07 2015 UTC,"Cheers thanks!   I bought myself the 4Black after my 3black died in a snowboarding accident, so I need to read up a bit more about it.  The backscatter lenses fit nicely but the one I had was plastic and crappy and had a orangy tint. Snake River Projects and polar pro make glass lenses which work way better.  I'm flying down to Hurghada tomorrow to dive BDE so I'm keen to test everything out.   Thistlegorm was an iconic dive for me too, but as much as people hate to hear me say this, I preferred Abu Nuhas. 4 wrecks next to each other with the Giannis D being a fantastic one. I think if we didn't have screaming currents and better viz then the thistlegorm would come in tops...but definitely recommended for anyone."
scuba,3d2vbo,lgmjon64,6,Mon Jul 13 02:15:35 2015 UTC,Shaw's cove in Laguna.  Free street parking.  Decent dive and snorkel spot.  There's also a decent beach for before/after. Also has tide pools for any non-swimmer scouts/leaders/parents.

scuba,3d2vbo,Jim3535,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"This is where I did my open dive for my certification.  It's a great site, though the visibility can be hit or miss.  It's a little bit of a hike down some stairs with all your gear as well.  We've often seen whales and dolphins here, too."
scuba,3d2vbo,an_alright_start,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"Shaw's Cove is one I've been meaning to do for some time.  I hear that parking can be pretty rough, especially for multiple vehicles.  How big a problem do you think that we would run into with that?"
scuba,3d2vbo,rumblejumble,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"I have never had an issue with parking, but with multiple vehicles you might have to drop your gear at the entrance with an adult leader or a couple of scouts and then park a couple blocks away. Even then you should be able to find street parking just might have to walk 5 minutes.  Visibility can be hit or miss there, so check the web before heading out for local visibility reports.  It is not within 30 of fiesta island."
scuba,3d2vbo,robotape,2,Tue Jul 14 10:48:28 2015 UTC,"Only site I've done in that radius is La Jolla Cove, and that was only once, so I'm not sure if my experience is typical for the site, but that day the entries and exists were very easy for a SoCal beach dive. The main reef is probably 300 yards out, so I'm not sure you'd be going there with a group of boys. But closer to shore there were still some things to see, like garibaldi and lobsters hiding in holes. Hopefully others that have done that site more often will chime in and give you more detailed info.  Here is some info on shore dives in SoCal and that area:   http://www.ecodivecenter.com/content/southern-californias-best-beach-dive-sites http://www.shorediving.com/Earth/USA_West/CalS/#16   p.s. this is what I went there to see"

scuba,3d2vbo,famousmodification,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"300 yards isn't terrible, when we've done Monterey, we usually end up kicking out about 200 yards or so anyways.  What is visibility typically like this time of the year?"
scuba,3d2vbo,buckerupbuttercup,2,Mon Jul 13 06:22:42 2015 UTC,"You've got some options.  First off is La Jolla Cove, which is about 30ft max depth in close with a bunch of kelp and rocky reef, but parking is tricky if you don't get there super early, and there's a 3 hour limit unless you go on Sunday. There's also some pay lots a little further away if you're willing to do that.  Second is La Jolla Shores, which is a bunch of sand at 30ft until you get to a short clay wall at about 60ft. Not a lot to see in the sand, but its where most classes go down here. There's sand dollar beds, some crabs, sanddabs, and the occasional pipefish. Parking is tricky in summer, fine most other times, and there's no time limits.  Third up is Marine Room. There's two dives here. The first is heading northwest, which is basically the same as La Jolla Shores, but the wall is at 35-45ft instead of 60ft. Heading south there's a shallow rocky reef that's maybe 15ft max depth. That can get surgy pretty easy, but there's a lot of life in there, including a sea turtle which I have yet to see. Parking is easier here than the other two places, but it's all residential so if you have a lot of cars you might have trouble. And as an added bonus, there's snorkeling for leopard sharks in the surf zone.  Last off, and frankly what I'd say is your best bet, is the Mission Bay Jetty. There's at least one shop that doesn't have access to a pool and does their confined water dives in Bonita Cove, which I haven't personally dove. But if you go out along the jetty, there's a  decent amount of life. People do occasionally fish off the jetty though, so that's something to be aware of. The jetty is about 15-20ft max depth, which not much going on out in the sand. And that's good, because there's no boat traffic by the rocks but there is out in the middle of the channel. This is probably the least frequently dove shore dive in San Diego, but I've had nothing but good experiences there. If you're okay clambering over the rocks, you can enter and exit anywhere, otherwise you want to use the beach entry at Mission Point Park and swim around the jetty. You probably want to plan around an incoming tide for visibility's sake, and I suppose you should be aware of tidal currents, though I've never had an issue there. Plenty of parking, and it's the also closest option to Fiesta Island."
scuba,3d2vbo,SamMaghsoodloo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:09:03 2015 UTC,La Jolla Cove is a pretty popular dive site. The snorkeling isn't bad either.
scuba,3d2vbo,LaserSailor760,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:53:14 2015 UTC,"If you're on fiesta island, the best easy dive to do is la jolla shores.  La jolla cove is a tougher dive, so la jolla shores is used for training dives and checkout dives.  It has easy parking, and easy entry.  The bottom is sand and there are no rocks."
scuba,3d2ei0,Stefaniereneesalyers,4,Sun Jul 12 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"No one mentioned this yet: practice on land.   If you can equalize on land but not in the water, you're equalizing too late. Equalize before you need to. The later you equalize the harder it is. If could be very well possible that your left ear just has a harder time equalizing than the right. Once you get to a point where it's hard to equalize, the right ear just takes all the air. Also, 10ft is too late to start equalizing. I start at 0ft and again almost immediately once my head goes under.   I used to have a hard time equalizing for about my first 60-70 dives. I did a couple of things:    1. netipot + allery meds the 2-3 days leading before. 1a. 2 hours before my dive I would take a 24 hour sudafed 2. practiced everyday on land. I figured it would stretch my eustachian tubes 3. Massaged the backs of my ears before I dove.  3a. Like an athlete warming up, I would massage and stretch my neck, massage and begin equalizing about an hour before the dive.  4. Before you descend, ""equalize"" first. Put an extra puff of air in there which gives you padding to descend.    After I did all of those things, I magically could equalize very easily. I don't do most of those anymore, but I do put a puff of air in my ear at 0ft before I descend."
scuba,3d2ei0,whizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:18:55 2015 UTC,That's really good advice thank you! I'm gonna try all of those!
scuba,3d2ei0,NikkiP0P,3,Mon Jul 13 16:04:32 2015 UTC,If you aren't currently experiencing allergies you can try debrox (which are ear drops you can grab at like CVS) to make sure it isn't earwax build up. If it is allergies you shouldn't dive with allergy medication because it could wear off or become ineffective after you've cleared and you won't be able to equalize while ascending.
scuba,3d2ei0,baldwadc,3,Mon Jul 13 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"I had an issue clearing my sinus in the pool. Instructor suggested neti pot and sudafed. Make sure it's the real stuff with psuedoephedrine, it will help dry out everything and should make it easier to clear. Check with Dan, they may refer you to an ent who is familiar with dive specific issues. Remember that not all meds are the same, and may not operate the same at depth. Dan and dive doc's are the final say, not the awesome guy who sounds good on the internet lol.  Other things, try to descend positioned vertically, it will help with the air wanting to rise, and you may just need to descend slower. As new divers we tend to sink fast. You may also want to sit at say 7-8 feet where you don't feel discomfort  for a few minutes and then try slowly bobbing a few feet down and back."
scuba,3d2ei0,jeffjones30,7,Mon Jul 13 01:10:36 2015 UTC,Before using meds to clear sinus please test your timing above water.  Need to know it will kick in before you dive and not wear off till you are done.
scuba,3d2ei0,baldwadc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yes I have heard Neti Pots could help (which I love using when I am really congested from colds and such).   What does sudafed do exactly?  And also, I heard of Doc's Proplugs which are vented earplugs that are supposed to help you equalize. I didn't try staying at each level longer, I'll try that next time! Thanks"
scuba,3d2ei0,Edward_Scout,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:25 2015 UTC,"Sudafed is a decongestant, it helps dry out your sinuses and to an extent can assist in drying out any mucus that maybe blocking your eustation tubes. It should be at your local cvs, Walgreens, etc behind the counter. As I said, if it persists, contact Dan, even as a non member they will give a lot of advice from people who know what they are talking about.  One girl in my class loved the earplugs and they helped a lot, but she forgot them at the next dive and did okay. I think a lot of it is your body adjusting to the increase in pressure."
scuba,3d2ei0,Edward_Scout,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:49 2015 UTC,My wife had issues trying to equalize in the pool and later on shallow reef dives. Through experience and perseverance we discovered that she's fine on deeper dives once she passes the 15' mark we just descend a bit slower than everyone else. Sometimes I stay on the surface and watch her until she gives me the OK from 15' so I can conserve air (I use more than her) then I join her for the rest of the descent. Once we hit our planned depth we just stay put for a few moments and she does the swallow technique a few times or pinches her nose and blows.  I'll ask her if she has any tips or tricks once she gets home from work.
scuba,3d2ei0,Edward_Scout,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much!!!
scuba,3d2ei0,Dose_of_Reality,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:46 2015 UTC,No problem. I've also found it is harder to equalize at shallower depths but once I get into even 20-30 feel of water it becomes much easier.
scuba,3d2ei0,Doub1eAA,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"So, I talked to wifey and she described pretty much exactly what I said above. Slower descents and frequent pauses to check and re-equalize. She said shallower water she feels the pressure changes much more and once she gets deeper she's fine as long as she takes it slow."
scuba,3d2ei0,buckerupbuttercup,2,Mon Jul 13 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I saw the doctor (ENT) today, and he said everything seemed normal in my ears and nose. He said I could take Claritin D for like 48 hours before I dive, then use Affrin nasal spray an hour before I dive! I bought special vented earplugs called Doc's Proplugs that are made for scuba diving and are supposed to make equalizing faster and easier!   Thanks for all of the help!"
scuba,3d2ei0,lionwar922,2,Tue Jul 14 20:09:59 2015 UTC,Try equalizing before you start to feel the pressure build up.  Try to preempt when you might need it.  Take it slow.  Don't force the equalization.
scuba,3d2ei0,lionwar922,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:36:03 2015 UTC,I have some trouble equalizing at times. For reference I had sinus surgery in my teens and have always had allergy issues. Did allergy shots for years and it made it much better.   I dive with a group of doctors/PAs/pharmacists and have been cleared to dive. If you have any questions see an ENT doctor. DAN can refer you to someone.   If I've had ongoing congestion recently I don't dive. I do take sudafed 12 hr beginning at least a day before diving and every 12 hrs until I finish diving.  I also found that putting a little pressure in my ears before even going below the surface does wonders.
scuba,3d2ei0,lackin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"Sudafed works well for clearing out your sinuses, but Mucinex works great for clearing out everything. Mucinex is my go-to when I get stuffed up from allergies, on top of normal allergy meds (daily Zyrtec 1x/day right before bed).   Another tip would be to equalize far more than you think you need to.  All of that being said, DON'T FORCE IT. You could blow an ear drum, which will prevent you from diving for a couple months. See a doctor if you continue feeling intense pain in your ear.   NOTE: Meds will affect you differently at depth than on the surface, and I'm not a doctor, so use this advice at your own risk."
scuba,3d2ei0,nigelh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:12:53 2015 UTC,Others said it as well.  If it hurts you've already waited too long to equalize and have pushed yourself too far.  Don't fret just take your time and go bit by bit DO NOT PUSH YOURSELF HERE  Too many students try to force themselves through discomfort and then end up taking themselves out for the rest of the pool sessiom because their ear won't stop hurting.
scuba,3d2ei0,ohjw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:12:41 2015 UTC,That seems to be what happened to me... Maybe I wasn't equalizing often enough.

scuba,3d1ebk,wolfgangmob,2,Mon Jul 13 04:12:30 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to find anything regarding anesthetic in breathing gas ever actually being used but it is known that 500ft+ High-pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS) when using helium. Also, there has been research in using anesthetic on animals to prevent HPNS but no such research in humans. In reality the diving practices were dangerous, partially because ""do it or we'll find someone else"" and partially trying to one up each other. That was the basis of the major court case in Europe. The North Sea divers did eventually form a divers' union in 1977 to enforce safe practices but there were still risky tests trying to push the limits. The court case dealt primarily with the fact that the companies involved, and the Norwegian government, knew there were risks but never told the divers in an informed manner and did a good deal of loose, empirical, science that ended up killing and maiming many divers."

scuba,3d04nj,croastbeast,7,Sun Jul 12 11:41:42 2015 UTC,"Dump valves are not for emergencies. They are generally placed in a spot ideal for venting gas in a horizontal position. The remote dump at the inflator elbow was designed for emergencies, but using it on a regular basis shouldn't be a problem, provided quality materials were used in construction of the bcd."
scuba,3d04nj,animals_are_racist,-6,Sun Jul 12 12:09:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I disagree. Dump valves are a way to vent buoyancy quickly, in my opinion, not regulating trim. Relying on a bug gas dump is a recipe for disaster in my opinion."
scuba,3d04nj,Crash_Coredump,2,Sun Jul 12 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"Really? So when I'm cave diving I should break trim to vent gas out my wing and possibly disturb the sediment? I'll try that next time I'm at ginnie. On an unrelated note, who wants to be included in my will?"

scuba,3d04nj,JoshKehn,6,Mon Jul 13 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"Why not ? Given your position in the water it's sometimes easier to use your dump valves, especially when you're facing downwards and the air in your wing jacket gets driven towards the lower valves. I tend to use the valve that's best suited for my current position to control buoyancy, not limited to my inflator hose. No one else ?"

scuba,3d04nj,absolutbill,6,Sun Jul 12 13:12:33 2015 UTC,Sounds like someone has never used a BP/W setup.   Dump valves function in a more reliable manner and don't require inverting your inflator hose. This means you can secure the inflator and it doesn't float around.

scuba,3czxx9,Soap-On-A-Rope,2,Sun Jul 12 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"This is my gopro rig. I'm working my way up to a full underwater camera set up. I also have a Hero4 Silver but unfortunately I haven't been able to get in the water with it yet.   I would say as far as what to get for your gopro that depends on what you want to do with it. You definitely need some sort of mounting system. I would highly discourage using a head mount system. I originally had my gopro on a floating bobber and would recommend that or a selfie stick if not a tray. Some like just turning their gopro on then not worrying about it which would make probably a mask-mount or chest/wrist mount one of the best options for them.   You definitely need a filter if you plan on taking videos/photos below 30 ft. Get a red filter if you dive in the tropics and a magenta filter if you dive in freshwater, the west coast(North of Monterey), or the UK.   I'd recommend a video light instead of a filter if you plan on taking photos or videos of macro/invertebrate subjects rather than landscapes or large subjects. Video lights(which have a wider beam as normal dive lights as to not overexpose the subject) can be pricey but as I found out completely worth it. Even at shallow depths."

scuba,3czxx9,alpahchino,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:51:37 2015 UTC,"Wrist or chest mounts are great for not accidentally loosing the camera. However, what I really love is having it mounted to a pole. Wildlife are way more comfortable getting close to the tiny GoPro on the end of a pole than they are getting close to me. I've had tons of fish, turtles, and eels investigate the camera, which makes for great shots. And you can turn the camera around and get shots of yourself diving."

scuba,3czxx9,phatbrasil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:26:36 2015 UTC,The red filter is a must.  Even if you see it blue on the lcd if you don't use the red filter after I think 15ft you'll have a red tint on all your footage.

I cannot post a link from mobile right now but Google watch water resistance rating.  You need something rated to 300 m for diving.  My wife and I personally like tag heuer Aqua racers but I know that is a very high price point.

scuba,3cz7il,Sniggey,2,Sun Jul 12 05:06:20 2015 UTC,"The rating is correct. The watch can handle pressures like what you'd find at 100m. The problem is that it's not hard to create great amounts of pressure at shallower depths. At just 30m, if you swing your arm around vigorously, the temporary pressure on the watch is quite high, perhaps more than it's rated for."

scuba,3cz7il,Protonious,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yes computers are nice, but they can fail. As with everything in SCUBA redundancy is key. Getting into the habit of wearing a dive watch isn't a bad idea. I started with a St Moritz SLK and a used Uwatech computer purchased from an estate sale.   Edit: I should also answer the other part of your question. Look for a watch that will securely fit over your wetsuit. Look for a waterproof rating of at LEAST 330 ft. Ideally the watch should be designed for diving. A warranty usually helps back up the waterproof claim. If you decide on a digital watch, ensure the buttons can be articulated at depth without problems. If you pick an analog watch it should have a rotating bezel to indicate the start of your dive time . The bezel should only rotate counter clockwise!"

scuba,3czhja,goodtimecat,5,Sun Jul 12 04:49:25 2015 UTC,Depends on the shop.  Just like any business.  Are you having an issue?
scuba,3czhja,garuba2,2,Sun Jul 12 05:14:38 2015 UTC,"Every shop in my area has pretty bad reviews. With most of them generally saying that they try to up sell you at every turn.  I get that it's a business, but I ain't trying to spend more than $800 on getting certified. Would you say that amount should cover getting certified? Also, I live in the NYC area."
scuba,3czhja,garuba2,5,Sun Jul 12 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"$800 should MORE than cover it.  Work with the shop, set a price, ensure it's all inclusive, define exactly what you are getting or it and get it in writing if you have to.  If they don't want to do that, walk.  Someone will.    Are you looking to get certified in NYC?  If so, you can expect that the course cost will be one thing, but you'll need some basic gear too.  Most everywhere requires you have your own mask, snorkel, and fins.  Beyond that, you may be looking at diving in a 7mm wetsuit or possibly even in a dry suit.  You can rent these things from most places, and many will include the BCD, tanks, weights, etc., etc. in the cost of the class."
scuba,3czhja,cassied21,2,Sun Jul 12 05:42:55 2015 UTC,$800! This should more than cover it. Do they line item the costs?  No wonder so many people come down to Florida for their certs. You could get your cert and take a mini vacation for that price.
scuba,3czhja,mxa020,4,Sun Jul 12 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, do the theory and the 5 confined water dives (swimming pool) in your home town, then go somewhere warmer/nicer for the 4 open water dives. That way you only spend two vacation days (2x2 OW dives) finishing up the course and you can do fun dives on the remaining days. PADI calls it a referral, ask your local dive shop."

scuba,3czhja,stds9tng,3,Sun Jul 12 06:08:50 2015 UTC,"Mask:  Don't look at price, look at how well it fits your face.   Try on every single one you can and get the one that fits best.  You'll probably find something in the $50-80 range.  The quickest way to have a miserable dive is an ill-fitting mask.  So it is absolutely worth it to buy whatever fits best.   Why save $20 now on a mask and then have a miserable dive trip to the Carribean for $1500?  Snorkel:  It's a simple plastic tube.  Get the cheapest.   More bells and whistles is just more unnecessary shit to break.  Fins.   $80-120 should get you something good that you like"
scuba,3czhja,garuba2,4,Sun Jul 12 08:16:44 2015 UTC,"Snorkel: It's a simple plastic tube. Get the cheapest. More bells and whistles is just more unnecessary shit to break.   If you're going to actually use the snorkel (either doing a lot of shore diving or if you just snorkel a lot on trips) then spending money for a good snorkel isn't a bad idea. But for the average diver who will rarely, if ever, use it? Then definitely get the cheapest you can find."
scuba,3czhja,misplacedyank,2,Mon Jul 13 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"Checkout Dolphin scuba.  They have a decent internet presence but their brick and mortar store is close to me.  At least you can have a reference point with it.  Also, Divers Direct would be another to check online.  Be careful though, you really don't want to buy most things online.  A mask needs to fit properly and the only way to do that is in person.  Also, a lot of scuba manufacturers won't honor their warranties if sold through an internet only source.  I know Divers Direct and Dolphin have brick and mortar stores so they are okay."
scuba,3czhja,scubahana,2,Sun Jul 12 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"would you know what is a reasonable price for a mask, snorkel, and fins?   This will be entirely dependent on what you end up getting. My first mask cost $50-60, my current mask is $160. My fins were probably $150ish or so and my snorkel was fairly inexpensive.   But by no means will everyone spend that. When you go to buy a mask, Try on every single mask you can get your hands on. Even when you think you found one you like, try on the rest to be sure. And try them on with a snorkel in your mouth. Get the one that fits the best, regardless of price. If it's $40, great! If it's $160, suck it up. It'll be WELL worth it in the long run. Trust me. A well fitting mask is paramount.  edit - You're in NYC so you could go to Leisure Pro in person, even."
scuba,3czhja,CanadianDiver,-4,Sun Jul 12 07:19:37 2015 UTC,LeisurePro has a longstanding reputation for being grey market equipment so I wouldn't buy from them if you want to be able to have warranty coverage recognised from the manufacturers.
scuba,3czhja,scubahana,2,Sun Jul 12 11:45:36 2015 UTC,"Actually Leisure Pro, while not necessarily getting manufacturer warranty will provide there own warranty in its place and is very fair to deal with.

scuba,3czhja,cassied21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"I would much rather rely on a manufacturer warranty though, I have worked in too many remote places to make a single-point location my warranty place. If they had locations around the world it would be  different story.   But as with anything grey market, you then risk the fact that you don't know where it came from or anything. For professional tools that keep me alive and solvent I would prefer product backed by the manufacturer."
scuba,3czhja,stds9tng,2,Mon Jul 13 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on what type of equipment you want. If you currently swim a lot now and you think you'll dive/snorkel very frequently then I would go higher end. Average pricing for good to great gear: Mask $70 +, fins $100+, snorkel $30+. I dive a lot. However I didn't buy all my gear at once. Durning my certs this was the perfect time to try gear. The shops I was with let students try gear(only during certs) during pool sessions to see what you liked/disliked. However not all shops are like this. They do this in hope you will purchase gear. After I completed open water very the only gear I knew I was confident in feeling comfortable in was my mask. From there I did more research, watched for the annual tent sale my dive shop had, and then purchased along the way. This also assured me into this new hobby (way of life) I was getting into. I've seen a lot of people spend upwards of $2000 while getting their certs just to hate the gear or never dive again. (As now you can't return your gear-most shops may only give you store credit at a much lower rate) Do the smart thing and take your time. Know what you want and not because it looks cool. But it because it's comfortable, fits your budget, and most of all is safe/reliable gear."
scuba,3czhja,GoesTo_Equilibrium,2,Sun Jul 12 12:16:18 2015 UTC,$800 should MORE than cover it.   For those of you claiming this is an absurd price- please understand that one of the shops I know in NYC pays $12k a month in rent for the shop and to rent time in the pool.

My students essentially are getting a private instructor with nothing to gain by pushing gear on them.  That being said, I do have a couple of LDS that I trust and will refer my students to, but I do that with specific instructions on what they REALLY need and what they should avoid. I encourage my students to make a list when they plan to start shopping and I am more than happy to go over it with them and make sure they are getting gear they will be happy with and that is appropriate and reliable for out dive conditions."
scuba,3czhja,CanadianDiver,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly and no offense to you, but if I'm doing a course with an independent instructor without the backing of a dive shop, I'm a bit more cautious about the price, knowing that:  (a)  The B&M Stores are the lifeblood of this industry, and independents work with the LDS for rentals and gear sales.  (b)   Because Independents have better margins by not having a storefront, everything can and should be negotiable.      I don't mean to be a prick, but when I open my wallet I know what I'm getting and what it's worth elsewhere.  That said, I did my EFR and Rescue course with an independent from the dive shop that recently closed its doors, but I won't be doing my DM cert through an independent.   I'd rather as a DM be connected to an LDS.    Also, I found out from this independent that you have to register as a business to get the gear discounts and insurance is a bitch if you're an independent."

Independent instructors don't have this luxury ... in fact, we still bring out students to the LDS to buy their basic kit and eventually their full set of gear.  Insurance isn't a problem, it costs the same regardless of whether you work for a shop or alone and if you work for a shop and don't carry your own insurance as well, you're nuts.  Regardless, at $400 or less - there is no margin for anyone.  Not sure what you mean about gear discounts.  Some shops teach very well, some don't.

Just the certification was about $450 of that $600.   Not horrible considering that was gear for pool sessions plus three days of boat dives in Turks and Caicos. It wasn't that much more expensive than doing just the dives there. Not the cheapest though. We had private instruction with just my wife and I which made her much more comfortable. It was worth every penny spent for that.   She has a friend that her and her husband went to a LDS to go through certification. The large class didn't work out for her so she quit. He finished but to get her to go back he is going to have to pony up for individual instruction.   It's not always about getting it the cheapest."

I complete the operation just fine, it's just a really uncomfortable 30 seconds or so while I basically waterboard myself as the mask tightens back down on my face.  Then I clear it and everything is back to normal.  Normal mask clearing goes just fine, it's just putting the mask back on that's the issue.  I've gotten to the point where I can just slug through it and continue on without drowning though.  I think it might be because I breathe through my nose and mouth at the same time most of the time on the surface so I might unconsciously be inhaling/not-exhaling slightly through my nose, or something like that."
scuba,3cxype,Thjoth,3,Sun Jul 12 07:19:29 2015 UTC,That could be it definitely. It sounds like you're inhaling through your nose when the mask is full of water which is why it feels like waterboarding.   Side note: You can breathe through your mouth and your nose at the same time? That's amazing. I didn't even know that was possible. I certainly can't do it.

scuba,3cxype,mecanxs,9,Sun Jul 12 12:13:36 2015 UTC,If you are just trying to practice no mask breathing and don't want to go to the pool you can kind of simulate it at home by filling your mask with water and putting it on. Then just practice breathing normally through your mouth. Other that that you would need to go to a pool and practice mask remove and replace as well.
scuba,3cxype,drlucky66,6,Sun Jul 12 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"Instructor here, I have a lot of experience fixing this. Water in your nose sends a message to your brain, that message is something along the lines of ""WE ARE GONNA FUCKING DIE!"" So you need not worry, you are not abnormal.   You are gonna have to get over whatever problem you have with taking a snorkel to the local pool, because that is exactly what you need. Hold your snorkel with your hand and lay with your face in the water, NO MASK! You must earn your mask. Do not add a mask until you are totally comfortable. I have had a student do this for upwards of 45 minutes before.  You can also practice this in your sink, just breath through your snorkel and hold your face in the water. Try not clinch your eyelids. Feel free to close your eyes, but relax your eyelids."
scuba,3cxype,animals_are_racist,5,Sat Jul 11 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"Lose the snorkel and bring only the mask. Everybody looks a little silly underwater; it's no matter. As long as you are exhaling with your nose during the clear, it is impossible for water to get up there."
scuba,3cxype,AIAmor,3,Sun Jul 12 01:20:20 2015 UTC,Mask clearing is the least favorite skill.   Most people don't like water in the nose or water in the eyes or on the face in general.   One way you can help prevent water in the nose is to slowly exhale through your nose instead of through your mouth.   Remember not to try to breath in through your nose.     One thing you might be able to try to just generally become more comfortable with water on the face is in the shower.   Run the water on your face while slowly breathing through your mouth.  That you want to try to improve your mask clear skill is the sign of a good student.

Then take the mask off, plug your nose with your fingers and close your eyes and get comfortable breathing - 20 more breaths.  Then slowly release your nose - 20 more breaths.  Then try it with your eyes open (if you want).  .  Then stop and repeat the whole thing again until you are fine sticking your face in the water with eyes open.    You can practice on your knees in a deep tub full of water.  Most dive shops have a ""pool time"" where you can go into the pool and practice with scuba people who won't look at you funny."

scuba,3cxype,wolfgangmob,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"Are you a nose breather on land? You need your brain to learn that it can breathe through your mouth if you have a snorkel/reg in even if there is water in your nose.  Before any dive or training session, take time on the surface to breathe through your regulator, mask off, face in the water.  (pro tip: hold mask out of water to keep defog from washing off)  an at-home version could be breathing through a snorkel with your face and nose in the tub, sink, or other container of water without a mask on.  edit: you can keep your eyes closed.  if you don't have contacts, you may want to experiment with opening your eyes underwater as well, but that is less important."
scuba,3cxype,c-lyin,2,Sun Jul 12 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"Do it in the bathtub! That's what I had my students do who were particularly anxious - that way you can open your eyes if you like. You won't be doing this with a reg obviously but you can practice putting your mask on and off - once you get comfortable with that it's cake really :-)  The next hardest part will be keeping buoyancy steady while you do it, but that will come with time."

scuba,3cxype,dragonriot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:09 2015 UTC,Sit in the shallow end of a pool where you can be on your knees with a snorkel. Breath through the snorkel with no mask until you get comfortable with it.  This way if you freak out/breath water you can stand up.
scuba,3cxype,TheeBeeDeeGee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:16:29 2015 UTC,"I had a really hard time with this skill when I was learning... I almost abandoned my certification because of it.     For me, I had to change the way water got into my mask. Our instructor always wanted us to pull the top of the mask away from our face and this caused a rush of water into the mask.  This freaked me the fuck out and I was really really struggling.    I watched some YouTube.    Saw one guy who did the ""partial flood and clear"" differently.  Instead of pulling the mask away, he ""pinched"" the top of the mask to open a small gap.  This allowed just a trickle of water to enter the mask.    I stated with just a bit of water down in the mask and I just left it there (like I swam around the pool for a while).  Then I cleared it.  Then I did it again.  The key here is I could let the water in slowly.    Once I was comfortable, I let more water in.  Clear it.  Let more in.  Clear it.  Let more and more in.  Clear it.  Over and over a little bit at a time.   Eventually the water was up over my nose and just about to my eyeballs. Eventually I could flood the whole mask and just swim around.    In a couple hours I was really comfortable.  Eventually I was able to flood the mask completely and then take it off, replace it, and clear it.    Now it is so easy I almost forget it was so difficult.    This small little change on how to slowly let water into the mask was the key.    Just pretend you are slowly popping a zit on your forehead right where the top seal of the mask sits on your forehead.  You can use your thumb and index finger to gently squeeze.  Video below:  http://youtu.be/dEG-OgH9zmU"
scuba,3cxype,LevitatingTurtles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:40:23 2015 UTC,"Start by practicing putting the mask on under water.  Just stay in the shallow end and hold the mask in your hand then take a deep breath, dip below the surface, and then put the mask on and clear it by exhaling through your nose.  Do this a few dozen times.  This way you avoid the shock of taking off a perfectly good mask while underwater and avoid the shock and confusion that it can cause for a beginner.  Once you've mastered putting the mask on underwater then you can move on to removing the mask under water, confident that you know exactly how to put it back on and clear it. (Sorry run on sentences)"
scuba,3cxype,lostcheshire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a sticking point for me because your body naturally does NOT want to breathe when your face is wet and your mammalian dive reflex is triggered. I always breathe through my regular with my mask off at the surface before a dive to acclimate, just in case I need to do the same at the bottoms. Practicing at the sink at home has also helped. Make sure the water is cold - it's harder that way!"
scuba,3cxype,TheMeiguoren,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly this was a big problem for me when I started. The only way I overcame it was to literally just swim around in a pool with NO mask on. Our instructor through our mask at the other end of the pool and we had to go get it with no mask then put it on and clear it. Being DEATHLY afraid of swimming with no mask HAVING to do it was the only was I got over it. Swimming with no mask on once you get over that initial ""shock"" of having no mask you relax a lot. Then once you relax you can do it for a while and really make your brain go ""I'm ok and not dieing""."
scuba,3cxype,WhiteLantern12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"First step to get comfortable with clearing your mask is learning how to breathe underwater without a mask. Breathing without a mask underwater was SO difficult for me; water kept flowing into my nose whenever I took a breath and I'd choke :( BUT aside from practicing in a shallow body of water (if you don't wanna go to the pool I guess a bathtub could work), what helped mentally was imagining how Darth Vader sounds and trying to replicate that sound. You should end up breathing with your mouth only and making a kind of ""haaa-haaa"" sound with every inhale and exhale. At least for me, that blocked my nose from trying to suck in any air/water and voila! You're breathing underwater without a mask! Then you can go on to practice using that breath to clear your mask. Hope that helps."
scuba,3cxype,shytide,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:01:22 2015 UTC,Can I offer my take on airway separation again.
scuba,3cxype,nigelh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:31:45 2015 UTC,"For controlling the soft palate there are two sounds to make:  The 'K' sound will close the soft palate.  The 'M' sound will open the soft palate.  Practise with these topside to get a feel for the airway control.  Next, grab a snorkel and fill the kitchen sink. Unless, of course, you've a pool readily available. The bathtub works, too.  First start with just exhaling through your nose. Take a breath, place your face into the water up to your ears and exhale through your nose. Once this is comfortable, grab your snorkel and practise breathing just through your mouth, and then in through your mouth (K) and out through your nose (M) - I find that the tongue placed against the front of the mouth versus the back makes it easier. Keep at the above until you feel comfortable.  Now for the mask clearing - head to the shower. Put-on the mask and then practise breaking the seal and allowing a little water in. Work on the partial-clear for a bit. Remember to look down, press against of the mask and exhale through the nose looking up just a bit - not too much as it'll allow water into your nose. In the confined and open water sessions, start with your chin against your neck, exhale and slowly bring your head to level.  From there, try full-floods in the shower. Also, try and stand with a full mask and breathe through your mouth. Get used to the airway control.  After all this and you're confident, head back to the confined water. Start with face in the water and regulator breathing. Next, sit on the bottom of the pool, maskless, breathing from the regulator. Once you're okay with the sensations, come up and put on your mask. Start with partial floods and work your way from there.  It's all training your body to not react the way it's programmed.   You'll get it in time!  Best of luck to you!"

Diving puts a lot more stress on the human body that most people realize. It appears nice and relaxing- but the hot sun, tight fitting exposure suits, weight of the gear and the need to climb out of the water with it on, not to mention potentially strong currents you may need to fight- all add up to a lot of stress. Cardiac arrest is the second leading cause of death among divers (drowning is obviously the first- though some of those may have been precipitated by cardiac arrest) and should not be ignored.  If you're built like a navy seal or have been cleared by your doctor- by all means tell me to shut up.

scuba,3cvfoo,phatbrasil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"Sysadmin.   The initial gear investment in scuba is expensive, after that you're usually pretty good to go unless you're like me and buy all your gear as fast as you can before testing out other gear. Then once you start diving your newly acquired gear you realize that there are numerous things you don't like so you start replacing stuff. Then you have a closet with about $6k in dive gear collecting dust.   All depends on where you live as far as the cost of actual diving goes. I currently live in Houston, changing at the end of the month though, and we don't have the best diving but if we go about 30 miles out into the Gulf of Mexico we get clear water at the rigs or even further out and you can hit the flower gardens. Rig dives cost about $250 for 3 tanks and Flower Garden trips are about $500-$600 I think. Can also get all inclusive stuff in Cozumel for under $1500. Again, it all depends on where you live. If you live close to water, there are problem some spots you can dive. If you're no where close to water, then yeah, it can be a pain."

If you're nervous mention it and ask for guidance before you get in the water. Concentrate on doing things right. We know everything is unfamiliar so nobody expects you to be an instant dive god but the instructor wants to see you moving forwards. If you do have a flaky moment do the STOP-BREATHE-THINK and then do whatever it was again. It really won't be as bad as you think and the buzz from doing everything is neat.

scuba,3crdbe,apostle228,6,Fri Jul 10 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Breathe from your diaphragm. And remember to breathe out fully before inhaling again. Slow, long exhales. Air left in your lungs is waisted air. It contains high % of CO2 and that gives your body the signal to breathe more, leading to shallower breathing and higher air consumption. With shallow breathing you will be exhaling O2 rich air because some air won't even reach your lungs - it will only reach the ""dead space"" where O2 cannot be absorbed. Good, complete ventilation of your lungs is key to optimizing O2 absorption, and lowering your air usage."
scuba,3crdbe,FRNJ-1138,3,Fri Jul 10 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"Probably the best answer of the bunch.  New divers always are shitty breathers, it is just how it works.  After you have some experience it will get better.  Breathe out slowly, don't use your arms.  Try not to race everywhere, it takes the same amount of air to get from A to B fast or slow.  Try to stay above your buddy if you find you are consistently the limiting factor on a dive."
scuba,3crdbe,Kadugan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"Can you explain what diaphragm breathing is?  Can I assume that if I'm taking deep breaths rather than shallow breaths that I am breathing from my diaphragm?  Otherwise I'm not sure what else I could be doing to change my breathing.  I'm a long time breather believe it or not, but it never occurred to me that there may be more than one way to breathe."
scuba,3crdbe,tinkletwit,3,Sat Jul 11 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"Are you constantly finning, feeling cold, or anxious/uncomfortable? Are you breathing deeply/slowly and exhaling the same?  Other than unnecessary movement, being cold/overweighted/anxious can increase your gas consumption.  Your sac should drop also as you get more experience. Yoga can help too."
scuba,3crdbe,runsongas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:13:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Staying relaxed and focusing on slowing your breathing down will help. Also, the deeper you go, the faster you'll run through your air.   How's your buoyancy control? If you're constantly filling/dumping your BC, you'll drain your tank faster. Also, if you're diving heavy, you're working harder to stay buoyant, and thus running through air faster."
scuba,3crdbe,buckerupbuttercup,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:55:03 2015 UTC,All good points. In regards to unnecessary movement; are you achieving proper neutral buoyancy?  I will occasionally catch myself working/breathing a bit harder than usual and it's almost always because I'm compensating for positive or negative buoyancy.
scuba,3crdbe,MyFavouriteName,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"I am never too cold, finnning fairly slowly, and don't feel anxious ever either, however overweighted is a possibility. I do feel ad if I am adding a lot of air and still sinking frequently. I'll try to work on my weighting a bit and see if that helps.   As for breathing deeply/slowly I feel like this is where my problem lies... I don't tend to think much about my breathing, I just I dunno... Breath! I have been letting my body inhale and exhale as it feels necessary and focusing more on other things I feel like. I dont tend to think much about my breathing which is why I came for advice :)"
scuba,3crdbe,runsongas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:01:19 2015 UTC,if you are breathing normally and relaxed then your sac should be low. resting breathing rate is pretty slow for most people. other people sometimes find sticking their tongue towards the roof of the mouth to give some resistance to breathing helps.

scuba,3crdbe,nigelh,2,Fri Jul 10 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"Physiology certainly plays a role. You're a big guy and—fit or not—big guys consume more oxygen than small ones. You also might want to focus on cardio rather than muscle training if that's an option at all (and having been in the army myself, we mostly did cardio anyway)—think Usain Bolt vs. a marathon guy.  The surface swim will probably contribute to your heart rate being already high once you get to do the dive—try to take it easy on the way out, and wait a few minutes on the surface to calm down and relax before you descend.  The rest comes should come mostly with experience and lots of diving.  If all of that still doesn't help, there's always the option of a bigger tank, or of doing active respiratory training. There's medical studies which showed that resistance-breathing exercises, which strengthen the respiratory muscles, can reduce air consumption for divers."
scuba,3crdbe,lopeztein,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, we mostly do cardio. Lots of running and calisthenics. Good idea on waiting a bit before descending, we usually descend immediately once we reach where we plan on going down. I'll try that too."
scuba,3crdbe,CanadianDiver,2,Fri Jul 10 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"Chill out, breathe long and slow. Never deliberately under breathe as your body interprets that as stress and will want to wind the breathing rate up more. Don't fight the instincts as they will always win. If you think your breathing rate is high put a hand on something, close your eyes for a moment and do ""I am so calm"" to yourself.  You body knows that you are under water and in its book that is a formula for dead quite soon. What you need to do it train out that response by doing calm, no worries so no drill that feels like you're having to do something helps. Just get on with the dive, breathe too much for now but let it learn that this is the new normal, dying didn't happen this time, won't happen next time so it can be relaxed about it."
scuba,3crdbe,falco_iii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:54:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from overweighting, are you bringing a bunch of gear down with you? Having a camera, slate, and all sorts of other stuff hanging off you is going to increase your drag in the water and make you work more.   Also very basic but try hugging yourself or find some other way to make sure you aren't using your arms to swim. Arm movements are a killer and you may not even notice you're doing it."
scuba,3crdbe,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:30:16 2015 UTC,"There are few things - some have already been mentioned here - that will drop your RMV.   RELAX - don't start your dive until you have caught your breath from your surface swim / exertion getting into the water. fix your weights - carrying too much lead will force you to work harder to move around in the water. frog kick - the most efficient finning method by far and is the only one with a rest cycle. Move smarter, not harder. hold your wrists - moving your arms around costs you gas proper buoyancy control - if your buoyancy isn't perfect, you are having to point and kick slightly up or down to maintain your position and there is a gas cost to this. Get in a pool and perfect your buoyancy and trim. This is the most important skill for every diver to master. use good equipment - regs that are harder to breath make you work harder to breath. Investing and tuning up your gear will drop your RMV. reduce drag - this goes along with buoyancy and trim, but cutting down on your profile in the water makes moving around less work and thus less gas."
scuba,3crdbe,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"Focus on relaxing.  Unnecessary movement and being overly tense / excited can add to your breathing & air use. Thoughtfully work on breathing - slow, deep breaths, constantly and slowly in & out. Practice buoyancy control in a pool - marginal buoyancy consumes more air with the BCD, means more movement and stress and takes away from thinking about breathing. When surface finning, stop to catch your breath before descending. If you are still limiting your dives, stay 2 - 5 feet above your buddy / group - you are under a bit less pressure and each breath willl have a little less air... every bit of reduced differential pressure helps."
scuba,3crdbe,fra-zzr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"What can I do to improve my breath control?    Dive. Dive dive dive dive dive. Seriously- that's about the only thing that will improve your SAC rate.  Several people in the thread have suggested relaxing- and that's a good idea- but relaxation comes with experience- so go diving!  All new divers go through 3 stages of air consumption:   Barely aware of it. Too many new divers don't check their SPG often enough- let alone give any thought to their air consumption. They're so task loaded doing everything else during a dive that it's not even a consideration. Aware of it and trying to improve. Eventually- the diver wants to improve their air consumption rate and so they try to do it consciously. Unfortunately this rarely works. They try consciously breathing slower, they try breathing shallow, they try skip breathing, and so on. All they accomplish is loading up on CO2 which increases their breathing rate and makes them feel lousy. They end up using more air in many cases- not less. Resignation and success. Eventually- they give up trying to consciously slow their breathing and just go diving. They relax. Their buoyancy improves. They shed unnecessary weight. All of a sudden they notice that they're using half the air they were when they started.   We had a newly certified student last year who, after just 20 dives, wanted to learn to dive sidemount so he could stay down longer. I spoke to him for a while and it was clear that sidemount wasn't the right choice. He really didn't have enough experience and comfort in the water to handle the extra task loading- and he didn't really need more gas- he needed to use less.  We did a full buoyancy class with him- dropped almost 10 lbs of lead, fixed his trim, and cleaned up his kicking style. I told him to get to 50 dives and if he still wanted to learn sidemount- I'd teach him. By the time he got another 20 dives under his belt his SAC rate dropped from 1.2 to .7 (and it's lower now).  He actually came back after 100 dives wanting to learn sidemount- but this time it was because he wanted to get into technical diving and eventually cave diving- not because he needed more air :)"
scuba,3crdbe,CanadianDiver,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:21:53 2015 UTC,"Great response, I have seen lots of good advice here but this one makes a lot of sense to me... Dive more, improve buoyancy, and air consumption will follow in suit is what I gather. I'll keep at it! And hopefully be able to report back with progress in a couple dozen more dives :)"
scuba,3crdbe,fra-zzr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:27:12 2015 UTC,The more often you dive- the faster you will see improvement. Get rid of the excess weight. Don't waste time during the dive thinking about air consumption- it won't help- concentrate on nailing buoyancy and trim instead. It really is that simple. If you are having trouble figuring out buoyancy and trim- then by all means- take a class or find an instructor willing to work with you.
scuba,3crdbe,rimbad,-2,Sat Jul 11 07:31:49 2015 UTC,"Diving overweighted is not necessarily the problem everyone makes it out to be. So long as you have compensated for this with your buoyancy device it makes little to no difference. You are most likely not neutral in the water and so exerting yourself more than necessary to hold position in the water column. If in doubt, while you are swimming just stop everything, dont move. If you are neutral in the water you will neither sink nor float. If you start sinking scoosh some gas in a buoyancy device until you are neutral then continue. Good to test this a couple of times to try and catch yourself out."
scuba,3crdbe,jms700,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:37:25 2015 UTC,"So long as you have compensated for this with your buoyancy device it makes little to no difference.   This statement is false. Neutral buoyancy is not the same as being trim and properly weighted. Having enough lift to compensate for excess weight still means you are having to work harder to propel that extra weight through the water. Inflating your BCD doesn't make the weight go away, it only stops it from sinking. You still require more force to move a larger mass in the water."
scuba,3crdbe,Kadugan,2,Fri Jul 10 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"You need to be careful with terminology here. You seem to be using weight and size to meant the same thing. Inflating a buoyancy device will provide an equal and opposite force to the excess weight you are carrying. Moving that now neurally buoyancy weight horizontally through the water will not require more force, assuming the extra gas required, does not significantly increase our horizontal profile in the water."
scuba,3crdbe,stds9tng,2,Sun Jul 12 09:23:25 2015 UTC,"F=ma  You are not constantly pulling against a vertical force if you are neutrally bouyant, but it still requires more force to get the same level of horizontal acceleration"
scuba,3crdbe,Kadugan,2,Sun Jul 12 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"I believe that making a mass neutraly bouyant does in fact remove the effective weight of the mass. When moving objects underwater like anchors and air lifts. Once the lift bags are in place, it takes very very little effort to move them horizontally, you only need to overcome water resistance."
scuba,3crdbe,crayons610,-1,Sun Jul 12 09:52:53 2015 UTC,What are you talking about?  Inertia?  Not that big a deal.  Trim would be more important.  Being overweighted does make buoyancy more difficult to maintain as you have to deal with even more expanding air as you ascend but that doesn't affect SAC.
scuba,3crdbe,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:47:59 2015 UTC,Being overweighted does make buoyancy more difficult to maintain as you have to deal with even more expanding air as you ascend but that doesn't affect SAC.   An overinflated wing (especially a taco) will definitely add drag (in addition to the annoyance of dealing with extra air and the fact that you need to waste extra air inflating the wing to begin with).  With a jacket style BCD the extra air ends up squeezing you and that makes your breathing a lot less efficient.
scuba,3crdbe,dragonriot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:05:02 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, but we're only talking a couple pounds, so it is not a big deal.  I'm more concerned with a new diver not having enough weight to stay under, especially as their AL80 drains down."

Grab some buds (see N3) and go and have fun, make (minor, non-fatal mistakes) mistakes (these are like, not running out of air after 30mins, working on buoyancy, etc), and have a bunch of fun! This is also a good option if you're short on cash and can't get the AOW immediately, as tank refills shouldn't cost more than $10 per (granted, rentals might get you).   Mask, snorkel, and fins are a great start. Depending where you live, a wetsuit might be the next thing, or a dive computer. After those, the expenses seem to pile up. (Basic dive computer can be like $150-$200, then the BCD can be anywhere from 300-600). Personally, I'd say rent for a while and try out a bunch of different gear (if available in your LDS) to get a sense of what you like/don't like. I met the divers I know through the LDS (there's only 1 where I live), and most of my dive buddies were in my cert class with me, or are family members who also dive.

The Advanced course is designed to be taken just after the Open Water course. In fact, I usually suggest to people that they don't stop at just Open Water because the Advanced course teaches many useful skills.    Mask and fins are a good first purchase. If you've got the money for a wetsuit, go for it. Unfortunately I don't have any recommendations RE: brands. I wear a Henderson that I really like, but I've never tried any others.  I've got a good scuba club here in Toronto, so I've lucked out. I'd suggest finding a shop or club local to you, but depending on where you live that might not be useful.

scuba,3co68t,MyFavouriteName,2,Thu Jul 9 21:07:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I've seen similar questions posted here before, and my answer doesn't really match what many others have said, so take it with a grain of salt, but I'll share my experience.  As far as the AOW course, I don't know - I've not taken it yet.  I'm looking at taking it sometime soon, as I'd like to look at higher level certifications, and I need my AOW to get those.  As far as the gear (and this is the part where my experience differs from the advice I've typically seen here) you might consider getting a complete set of gear fairly quickly (BCD, Regs, gauges, computer, etc.).  I can say with certainty that I've done MUCH more diving since I got gear than I ever did before I had gear.  I got my OW and dived once or twice a year for a couple of years, and then I bought gear and started diving 1-2 times a month.  I'm kind of an opportunistic diver.  I've lived near coasts with good diving for most of the time I've been certified, and the cost of spending $50 to rent gear for the day meant that I wasn't going to be able to afford all that often.  I'm the only diver in my immediate family (my wife and kids don't dive) so going on a diving-centric vacation isn't really an option.  Anyway, even with limited experience diving, I bought a set of gear.  Perhaps if I had more experience as a diver, I would have chosen different gear, but to be honest, my fairly cheap set of diving gear has been nicer than the rental gear anywhere I've dived.  I bought a package deal from leisure pro and was fairly shocked at how little I wound up paying.  I was able to call them and get the package tweaked to reflect what specific things I wanted (like a weight integrated BC and a computer instead of a depth gauge) without any hassle.  Hopefully this doesn't read like an ad.  I don't have any affiliation with them, and I honestly just chose them based on the price of their package deals, but I've had pretty good experiences with them.  Anyway, at least for me, having my own full set of gear meant that I could dive for the cost of a tank rental.  That meant that I was able to dive frequently, unlike my dad and sister who got certified at the same time and place as me, but pretty much only dive on vacation.  Where are you getting certified?  There are dive clubs in many different parts of the USA (and sometimes elsewhere too)."
scuba,3co68t,tokekcowboy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:12 2015 UTC,I took advanced open water.    It's just a good way to get five dives in and experience some new things.  For what I paid it pretty well breaks even on the cost of renting gear.   It also expands you from 60ft depth to 100ft depth as well.      I recommend the OP go that route and take rescue diver as well.   Makes him a better dive buddy.  So far as gear is concerned here's the order I recommend:   Dive computer.   Many places don't rent you a dive computer or charge a surcharge for it.   Start there. Exposure suit.   If you are going drysuit this will be your biggest expense by far.  For cold water a drysuit is almost a must - especially if you plan to go deeper.   My wetsuit gets pretty damned cold at around 80ft where the neoprene compresses. BCD and Regs Tanks   The worst part is for the OP that as you buy gear the ROI on it stinks until you have the full setup.

It really depends on the person.  Advanced Open Water isn't really an advanced class.   It's just advanced compared to basic open water.   There's a lot of chatter in the community about the naming convention used as it doesn't really imply your an advanced diver, you're simply advanced from the regular open water diver world.  TBH if you aren't comfortable with gear and everything else, you probably shouldn't have passed the OW class, but you and I both know it's pretty hard to not pass that class, and I've seen some rather questionable folks still passed through it.    You have a valid point.   100feet vs 60feet is very, very different   lol of course!  It's colder, darker, and you have way less bottom time and have to watch that SPG like a hawk too :-)"
scuba,3co68t,rainman_104,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"no condescention, the simple fact is NO ONE just out of OW without some additional dives is fully comfortable with their gear and movement underwater. NO ONE, that's not condescension, it's fact. How many dives it takes to reach a level worthy of going deeper just depends on the person. Some it just takes a few more dives, others it can take a ton. Either way whether padi allows it or not, absolutely no one with just OW and no other dives whatsoever should be doing AOW and going to 100feet, it's simply unsafe and breeds unsafe divers who feel overqualified and get themselves killed. It has happened many times and it'll happen again until people quit treating diving like a game to be rushed through"
scuba,3co68t,avboden,2,Fri Jul 10 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"Do NOT jump right into AOW. Here's why: with greater depth comes greater danger. You simply should not take that step until you are FULLY comfortable with your gear and movements underwater without thinking about it. If something goes wrong at 100feet, you can't be thinking about the basics while doing whatever is needed.  This may not take very long to get to that point though. For some divers it's after another 5 dives, others it takes 20. Either way you should absolutely have some more dives under your belt before going to advanced. PADI just jumps right to advanced so they can take more money from you off he bat. A beginner with advanced breeds a false sense of security. When I was in Galapagos a diver died a week later there because they were a straight to advanced newbie over their head. Not saying you'd do that, but it is reality, diving is dangerous and training shouldn't be rushed.  When you do get to that point though and want to do advanced, do nitrox at the same time."
scuba,3co68t,avboden,2,Thu Jul 9 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"As you see there's a lot of disagreement on moving to AOW right out of the gates.  Here's my two cents.   Do it - But realize that afterwards you are NOT an advanced diver.  Being an advanced diver takes time and practice.  But that time and practice should be in good habits, not bad.  Moving from OW to AOW means you'll be diving more with an instructor, diving conditions you aren't familiar with, and learning more about diving in general in a controlled (i.e. with an instructor) environment.  More knowledge is a good thing.  Understanding that you need experience to go with that knowledge is a great thing.  So, go ahead, get your AOW, but until you have logged a lot more dives (and that number is different for everyone) don't consider yourself an ""advanced diver"" whatever that means.  The knowledge you gain and being able to dive more with an instructor helping and teaching can only help you in the long run."
scuba,3co68t,garuba2,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"Advanced Open Water is really rather misnamed.   A more correct name would be Open Water II but some marketing droid decided to be all flashy and then all the other agencies copied.  So with that in mind, if you feel like it then do it.   Just remember you are still inexperienced and still learning.    Hopefully you'll never stop learning."
scuba,3co68t,ferdinandblue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:45:18 2015 UTC,"Before you buy a BCD, try out a backplate and wings set-up. You never have to decide between crushing the air out of your lungs and floating on the surface.

scuba,3co68t,rainman_104,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:35:08 2015 UTC,"AOW (or any class really) is only as good as the instructor. The AOW class I had was a joke. The most important things as a new diver are to get relaxed in the water and get your bouyancy dialed in. The best way to accomplish that is to go out and dive. Find a more experienced buddy who can show you the ropes and go out and have fun. Nobody is going to write you a ticket if you go below 60 ft - just use common sense and be conservative with your air and bottom time.  For gear I usually recommend an exposure suit as the next purchase, since rentals are often peed in and don't fit properly.  Good luck and happy diving!"
scuba,3co68t,crazybee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"Wait before you do the AOW, get some experience diving, get more comfortable in the water. log more dives... just go diving.. don't immediately do the AOW. getting a new certificate/new label doesn't make you a better diver, practice does. wetsuit, there are plenty of options for men, but if you are a girl only a handful of brands are good. Honestly this depends on where you will be doing most of your diving, if its warm water aim for a 3mm. As a beginner you don't have to buy all the equipment right away, just go diving and see what you like through renting/trying different gear from friends etc. After you get certified if you continue to dive often I suggest the next piece of equipment you purchase (after wetsuit) is a dive computer.  Your local dive centre is where you meet most divers, ask your instructor.. and eventually you'll meet the social ones that will get you involved with your local dive community."
scuba,3co68t,Barefootjunglegirl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"it doesn't really matter. AOW is kind of silly if you ask me. The only prerequisite is the OW course so it doesn't really mean you advanced in anything. I took it after about 40 or so dives for shits. Only thing I learned was that I hate using compasses underwater and I was usually over-weighted.  You have what you need. Rent the rest and try out different gear and see what you like and what you don't like, THEN buy. Otherwise, you'll be like me and have about $6k with of gear in a closet that never gets used.  Find a dive club via google. When I first got certified I knew one person that was also a diver so I rarely got to dive. Ended up finding a dive club in my area and went from like 7 dives to 50 in a couple months."
scuba,3co68t,phorkor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well I'd be quite happy to carry on and do AOW. It gets you some more supervised dives and makes you more certification friendly to dive operations. Ticking off deep and dark dives and thinking through navigation before you head out on your own is very good in my view.  As to kit I'd agree that a suit is a good purchase. If you're diving wet the suit wants to be snug so you get zero water circulation (not just a little, a big round zero) and that means your chance of finding that on the hire rack is reduced. Be prepared to shop around for best fit. Regs and a BCD are easy to do a check on as they pass them out to you. Also you can get to know how much weight you want for you in your suit while a hire suit is always a bit of a guess."
scuba,3co68t,nigelh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"Since your questions seem to be pretty well answered, Ill ask you one.   There are several volunteer and job opportunities available that I have seen and I really want to be able to jump on these opportunities- however they require scuba certification.   Where do you see these? I have rarely came across any. Well exception being those ""volunteer"" programs where you pay thousands to get somewhere to ""volunteer"" for few weeks.  Or are these something thats offered to people with some kind of degree in conservation etc. (I dont know what the degree would be called), that you already have?"
scuba,3co68t,WnbTravellerDude,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Wait until you have dives under your belt before jumping right into AOW. The AOW class will help you with bouyancy, underwater navigation, etc. Things you won't be prepared for until your comfortable diving.  I would recommend buying a light of some sort and a safety sausage. Those things don't always come with a rental setup. My next purchase would be a good dive computer. That way you can learn how to use and understand it."

scuba,3co68t,bobbaphet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:12:38 2015 UTC,First thing to buy (imo) would be a BCD. It's a vital piece of equipment and it's good to have one that you're comfortable in and know well. I would just do some diving before you go for AOW. Maybe after 20-30 dives or so I'd look into it.
scuba,3co68t,toastyseeds,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  I would get the AOW if you can afford the class and have the time do it.   Your gear is good so far, I bought a cheap seavenger wetsuit from Amazon. It's 3 mm and works fine for me. But that's a personal choice for you to make. You need to consider the water temp where you plan on diving most of the time. I went 3mm because I'm a bigger guy and I don't get cold very fast. If I needed a thicker suit I can rent a 5mm from my LDS. But go a few times decide what works for you.   As far as friends I just joined divebuddy.com I also joined a local group that supports the artificial reef construction in my area. I also tagged along with my LDS a few times. It takes time but if you go diving you will meet people.   Good luck! Cheers!!"
scuba,3co68t,Trooplee,0,Thu Jul 9 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"First off, Welcome to scuba diving,  I've always heard that AOW isn't really that important unless you plan on going for your Rescue Diver, Master Diver and/or Dive Instructor certifications.   As far as buying gear, I wouldn't suggest buying too much gear at the moment. I would rent a BC, regulator and dive computer for the first few dives so that you can test them out to see which kinds you like. Also, I would suggest buying used gear. A lot of new divers go out and spend a couple grand on brand new gear and only dive with it once or twice. If you're willing to look for it, you should be able to find some used gear in like new condition for a fraction of the cost of buying brand new gear. If you really have an itch to spend money, a tank (or two) would be a good investment. But again, I would suggest renting an aluminum tank and a steel tank to see which one you like better.  As for the wetsuit, it depends what kind of dives you're planning to make. I live in Florida and dive in the Gulf and I only wear a 1mm rash guard shirt and a swimsuit. But if you are diving in colder waters or plan on going on deep dives or cave dives, a thicker wetsuit might be better.  Not really sure about your last question. I'm sure there are websites that will pair divers. Just know your limits and don't let them push you to do things you're not comfortable with as a new diver.  My best advice is to have fun and enjoy yourself!"
scuba,3co68t,pihb415,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"I've always heard that AOW isn't really that important unless you plan on going for your Rescue Diver, Master Diver and/or Dive Instructor certifications.    Well true, however with the cost of renting gear, AOW is about $300 and gets you a minimum of five dives logged and it expands your depth to 100ft if you want to go that deep.  Yeah air supply sucks at that depth.   I do however go down to 80ft regularly as in my waters we have a lot of plankton that limits viz in shallower waters."
scuba,3co68t,rainman_104,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree with you on AOW - I found this class extremely beneficial and learned a ton about managing my buoyancy. I'd recommend it for any scuba diver, whether you plan to pursue future certifications or not."
scuba,3co68t,muddygirl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right. As someone else mentioned, it's more like OW II. As for 100' being a problem, it's every divers responsibility to dive safely. If you never go deeper than 30' AOW will teach you proper habits to improve on. Why wait 30 or 40 dives to realize you've been using poor technique."

The Ear  The Eustachian Tube  It is always open to a certain degree that allows the pressure in your ears to equalize. This happens all day long for everyone unless you have a specific blockage.

scuba,3cq14y,texasguy911,2,Thu Jul 9 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"The Eustachian tube is always open but a bit floppy. When the pressure in your sinuses is higher than the middle ear the tube can get slightly kinked and not flow so well so the jaw thrust or yawn ways to equalise are tricks to pull the tube to make it straighten up and open but slightly over-pressuring your sinuses, the nose pinch and blow, works too. When air wants to get out it just inflates the tube and that opens it so you normally never fell it happen.  Well not 'never'. A reverse block, normally caused by diving with a cold or using stuff to unblock your head that wears off during the dive can be a painful problem. The usual advice is don't mess with decongestants when diving. Dive tomorrow instead."

It is one of the five largest orders of bony fishes by number of species with over 1,320.   They are known as ""mail-cheeked"" fishes due to their distinguishing characteristic, the suborbital stay: a backwards extension of the third circumorbital bone (part of the lateral head/cheek skeleton, below the eye socket) across the cheek to the preoperculum, to which it is connected in most species.   Scorpaeniform fishes are carnivorous, mostly feeding on crustaceans and on smaller fish. Most species live on the sea bottom in relatively shallow waters, although species are known from deep water, from the midwater, and even from fresh water. They typically have spiny heads, and rounded pectoral and caudal fins. Most species are less than 30 cm (12 in) in length, but the full size range of the order varies from the velvetfishes, which can be just 2 cm (0.79 in) long as adults, to the lingcod, which can reach 150 cm (4.9 ft) in length.

scuba,3cmo5k,nigelh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:37 2015 UTC,Wimps. I did a course in South Wales and we did a bunch of line laying drills in a reservoir before moving onto a cave. The vis went from zero in dark red to zero in black. Occasionally you felt the instructor's hands checking up on you. Frankly I found it far more disconcerting doing this in only a meter or so of water than the lights out drill in gin clear water with a hard ceiling above us that we did later.  I like green water diving. The first time I went to the Red Sea on holiday I stepped off the boat into about 15 meters looked down and had a problem I'd never had before. Vertigo.

It is these skills, properly applied, that mean you can do all the years of fun stuff to follow.  The key thing you learn from day one is STOP-BREATHE-THINK. Keep your mind on the job and you are safe. If you get a nervous moment in the water run your hands round your gear. You understand it. You are in control. It's OK to continue.  Enjoy the course."

A harness is nothing but a length of 2"" webbing that you lace through the backplate. You add D-rings where you need them, and a buckle, a crotch strap, and you're done. No tools, no fabrication (unless you want to install a grommet). Just webbing, D-rings, and a buckle.  Here is an example:  https://www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-ultimate-hogarthian-harness"

That's great and all- but as I said- there's nothing to ""make"" - not unless you plan on forging the D-rings/keepers and buckle.  You're basically buying a bunch of individual pieces instead of a package of them. I suppose you could sew the loop on the crotch strap- but unless you already have an upholstery sewing machine (something with a hefty needle and a walking foot) and the right thread- you're not going to be able to make a nice, clean connection.  When you buy a ""harness"" all they give you is 12' of webbing, some D-rings with keepers, and a buckle. You assemble it yourself to fit your body. Short of buying the components individually- there is nothing you can do to make it more DIY (again- unless you plan on weaving your own webbing or making your own buckles)."
scuba,3cla7j,runsongas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"to be fair though, buying the separate pieces is a lot cheaper from DGX than their harness kit. the separate pieces are only around 30 dollars if you don't need a grommeted piece of webbing."

scuba,3chstj,Siayn,2,Wed Jul 8 00:39:50 2015 UTC,is it true the currents are strong? and dives are not for beginners?
scuba,3chstj,mayola29,3,Wed Jul 8 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely true. This is big boy/girl diving. Rough seas, strong currents, cold water. There is nothing relaxing about these dives. On the 18 dives we did, two were ended early because the surge was smashing us into the rocks and it just wasn't worth staying down for. You can't go straight up to the surface because the boats cannot get that close to the cliff walls. So the solution is you swim out into the blue, do your safety stop in the current as you drift into the open ocean, and then use your signal devices to flag down a panga for pickup.   Honestly, if you are in good shape, have excellent buoyancy control, and aren't afraid of current and open water, you will be fine. It's not that hard. However if you are inexperienced this stuff will get in your head and you will panic. I have watched people with 1000+ dives have a panic attack under water and burn a tank of air. I have dove with people with less than 100 dives that handled themselves better than the local dive guides. It's all about your comfort level under water.   If you want relaxing and pretty dives, I recommend the Caribbean. If you want to have badass pelagic encounters, then the diving will most likely suck, like in Galapagos or Cocos, but it will be infinitely more rewarding."

I have a Sj4k and I don´t like the case buttons, as they sometimes stick a bit.  In my opinion the more important thing is light. A good u/w water light is necessary if you go below 10m-15m. the light needs a wide angle like 120° and you need a mount to put camera and light on.   I don´t use protune, I think the white balance can be done by many programs like Magix Video Deluxe"
scuba,3ck0f0,monokid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"In general, how much light in lumens do I need? (Probably won't need it anyway, diving in Malaysia is always under sunlight and might not be doing cave/wreck diving soon, but good to know anyway)"
scuba,3ck0f0,monokid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"I´ve seen some videos with gopro that had light and motion setup worth ~2500-3000$ and the advert. still gone to gopro ;-) A good vendor let you know the Lux instead of Lumen. Cause Lux is messured at the object, while Lumen is what the LED (fe) can emit. the light will lose some % with every medium that it enters. LED-> reflector -> glas -> water. so it´s not unusual if you take a 5 000 Lumen light down it feels like 2000 or much more less. when you don´t use a light and you´ve got very good conditions, think about filters (red, magenta). Red for depths below 20m, magenta 0-10(15) or green looking water.  A more important thing with LED light   diving are the Kelvin. Arround ~7000 Kelvin  gets your picture more cold white. That´s why you try to get arround ~5000 Kelvin.  PS: you can´t have enough light while diving, but I think real 3000 Lumen is a good start"

scuba,3ck0f0,king_of_battle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Protune is like capturing RAW footage instead of throwing the images/videos through the camera's auto-processing white balance and settings. By having Protune turned On, it allows the camera to take in the maximum amount of light that the camera is physically capable of doing. When videographing underwater, light is always a huge problem because the further down you go, the less light there is (which is why many people bring their own lights in the form of strobes on some sort of mounting system).   I dive with a gopro4, my dive buddy dives with a sealife. There's no argument in quality, as the gopro has far superior image/video quality.  Everyone has to do post-production regardless, but if you have better lighting (or more light) in the images, you get a better-quality product."

Some people enjoy it as a fundamental part of the hobby by writing full dive reports while others just log date, location, depth, mix and time. I got more and more minimalist over the years until I was logging whole trips away as single lines on a page and then I stopped altogether. Admittedly I could probably reconstitute the recent dives from my computers but nobody has ever challenged me with something like ""You can't come on this trip unless you have X recent dives to comparable depths"".  What looks good is putting it on a web site but if you want a permanent log make sure you have a hard copy somewhere. Personally, if I was still logging, I would generate my own pages with things I wanted as boxes and a blank comment section below. Then I'd print on quite a high weight paper in an ink I had tested for seawater resistance. I don't mind the pages curling up a bit if they get damp but they need to remain readable. Have no hesitation to change the template to include extra stuff at whim.  The thing I do have is that I scanned my cards and current medical certs and stuck them on a web page (with no in-link) so I can obtain that information from anywhere in the world. I've never needed it but it seemed like a safe thing to do so I can quote the numbers to get a replacement card if ever I loose them. Not that any body has ever asked for a card either.

scuba,3cicb8,monokid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:04:24 2015 UTC,"Go to the dollar store and get a notebook.   If it gets full go buy another.   You can write as much or as little about each dive.  You can draw a map.   You can sketch fish you're trying to id.   Personally I usually record depth, time, gases, water temp, gear configuration incl weighting and exposure suit (because I dive a lot of different conditions and it's nice to see what I used last time for these conditions and how it worked) plus whatever I feel like writing about the dive"
scuba,3ch3sc,tliam,7,Tue Jul 7 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"The big trick is to dive a lot and then dive more.  Don't worry about your air consumption.  It will settle out over time.  Diving is an inherently stressful thing for anyone, even if you don't notice it.  There's lots of stuff you have to account for.  You are in a non respirable medium. Your vision is limited.  There's thermal stress, task loading, and mild (or more than mild) narcosis.  You're using muscles that don't usually get used.   Lots of stuff is happening.  If anything, concentrate on the following.  Take steady full slow inhales and exhales.  Breathe from the belly, not the chest.  Optimize your trim and bouyancy.  Reduce danglies and drag.  Use a frog kick and glide between strokes for 2 seconds.  Extra ankle involvement is good in the frog kick because it doesn't use the larger muscle groups of your upper legs.  Dont use arms unless you are using the pull and glide technique (can be good on wrecks/ situational) There is plenty to practice, but the biggest thing is underwatercomfort .  One thing that helps is to get your breathing under control BEFORE the dive.  I dive with big steel doubles and a stage.  I am often mildy worked up just by gearing up, getting in the water and the stress of OH GOD HERE WE GO.  On every dive I can, I float on the surface with my face in the water for at least 30 seconds, just breathing off my reg.  If there  is a current, I'll hang off the line at 10 or 20 feet instead.   I chill, wait til my brain has settled, my breathing has slowed, and that I know all systems are go.  Then I dive."

scuba,3ch3sc,ewanvt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:27:50 2015 UTC,"As to diving and diving more, that's the plan. I hope to get 10-15 dives in this month. The plan anyway.  I'm fairly streamlined, my buoyancy took a few dives to feel close right. I burned through an Al 80 in 20 minutes at ~80', light/no current and 55 degrees. That's about 10 minutes less than usual.   It feels like my chest/lungs are being compressed. It's a little hard to explain the sensation. It feels similar to the sensation I had for months after the accident.  I know what you mean about settling down. I was taking a my time to zen out with my buddy before we go down, so that helps."
scuba,3ch3sc,Crash_Coredump,2,Tue Jul 7 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"Think about breathing first, then the rest of the tasks, instead of the other way around. It'll help your gas consumption and your buoyancy. At least in my case it does."
scuba,3ch3sc,lgmjon64,2,Wed Jul 8 02:32:02 2015 UTC,Try using an incentive spirometer. We use them in the hospital on patients who just had surgery or have respiratory issues that may not allow them to fully inflate their lungs.   Edit: One of these
scuba,3ch3sc,Voicy,2,Wed Jul 8 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a 220lbs dude and I finish a 1hr / 15_20m dive with around 100-120bar in my 12L cylinder (filled to 230bar).  I used to burn through air but my dive /uw photography buddy taught me a simple technique which may or may not help you.  Try it from where youre sitting now: Place your tongue against your pallet and breath in normally. You'll feel resistance as the air flows around your tongue but it still fills your lungs to capacity, just slower. Same technique for exhaling. Without skip breathing its lowered my breathing cycle to 4  breaths a minute and does wonders for my buoyancy.  It takes some practice before it feels normal so try it above ground for a while. Hope it helps, if not good luck and hope you heal fast!"

scuba,3ch3sc,dyer346,5,Tue Jul 7 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm working from memory here, so my medical terms may be off and this was before I was diving. When I cracked ribs I had to be careful that my ribs did not scar to my pleural cavity, otherwise there could a point that ""sticks"" and doesn't allow for proper breathing. Possibly something to look into."
scuba,3ciuee,IncendiaryGames,3,Wed Jul 8 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"Okay first - don't let yourself get too discouraged. You sound like you've made some great strides on personal progress and are continuing to work on fitness which can only help. Keep working on swimming and comfort in the water and practice taking deep, slow, long breaths when you're in the water. If all you're doing is swimming, try throwing some cross training in there to change it up.   Diving isn't an easy sport. Not everyone takes to it naturally, many people have to work hard at it. Repeating the first Open Water session isn't the end of the world and it can only help. Since you know you can do the mask clearing and reg retrieval with no problem, you can focus on your breathing while the skill is being demonstrated and worked on.  Now, I'll go through your annoyances point by point.   Annoyance 1:  4 lanes for 8 people isn't necessarily unreasonable. That's 2 people per lane and is plenty of room to get the swim, treading water, and underwater basic skills done. If people don't know how to stay on their half of the lane or share a lane or whatever, that's not really the instructor's fault. The chaos from swimmers isn't something that can be controlled.  Someone else said:   As far as the swim thing went, that was prickish of him too.   Yes and no. He probably could have been nicer about it but they can't sit around and hold up the whole class for someone to elementary backstroke 200m either, especially if one person is only 1/3 of the way through.   No idea why they didn't give you the snorkel option.  Annoyance 2:  Ehhh probably a bit of a dick move but sounds like he was combining skills to save some time.   Annoyances 3 & 4:  There's probably not a lot of time built into the class for breaks and stuff. There's a lot to cover in each session and breaks take away from instructional time. Completely uncalled for for the instructor to scold you for your air consumption. And for making you stop at 1,000PSI. Some people are air hogs, some people aren't. Typically speaking, air consumption gets better with practice/more diving. If you're going to continue with the class, is it possible for you to ask for a larger tank? We had an air sucker in my OW class and they gave him a larger tank to help bring his bottom time more in line with the rest of us.  That they didn't have an extra tank sucks. It sounds like they weren't expecting someone to suck air as fast as you did and didn't plan for it. It probably doesn't happen to them very frequently and didn't know to plan for it. :/  Annoyance 5:  Stay hydrated, drink some water when you're back on the surface. Also swallow whatever saliva your mouth makes while you're breathing, don't exhale it.   Overall though, it simply sounds like things didn't go as you'd envisioned/hoped and it kind of takes some of the shine off of the experience. Try not to dwell on everything that went wrong but find what you can improve on and work on those. Don't be afraid to post-pone the rest of your class if you have to either. Talk to your instructor and see if he'll let you try again in a few weeks/months or if he has any recommendations.   Hang in there. The payoff is so worth it. :)"
scuba,3ciuee,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:32:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you. :) You're right, no one else there knew how to circle swim or share a lane. He is letting me make up the swim portion with mask, fins, and snorkel. :)   I'm also asking him if he can bring extra tanks next time or let me dive on a 100 or 120. No idea if he will let me yet. I hope so.   Thank you for the tips on fighting my cotton mouth feelings. I definitely wasn't swallowing saliva. Thank you for your support! ^.^"

scuba,3ciuee,Gutterlungz1,2,Wed Jul 8 17:51:12 2015 UTC,It doesn't sound too bad. You missed two drills but they won't be hard to catch up. It will be harder if you have a fitness problem but try and cooperate. Also a thousand PSI sounds like a lot but at the moment he is the one responsible to watch your gas levels so he needs more margin if he has a bunch of students to watch.  Come and have a rant at us if it helps but try to be Mr. Calm and Helpful in the pool. That makes a huge difference to your gas consumption and your learning speed. A lot of these basic drills are horrible but they are all about loading your mental tool box so the day when something goes wrong on a dive you do the right thing and end up back ashore wondering what it will cost to replace/fix the thing that broke. We all hated them at first but we still practice them.
scuba,3ciuee,avocaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:30:24 2015 UTC,"Your instructor sounds like a dick. 1000 psi is wayyyy more than you need to complete a couple skills before getting to 500 and further more, he should've had the foresight to bring an extra tank or two for just this reason or he could've let you swap gear with someone of similar size that had more air leftover. As far as the swim thing went, that was prickish of him too. Where are you if you don't mind my asking?"
scuba,3ciuee,ozuri,2,Wed Jul 8 06:59:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I live in San Francisco. I'm a large guy, only one with an XL BCD so a gear swap would of been harder."

scuba,3ciuee,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:36:45 2015 UTC,I'm an instructor in SF. It sounds to me that you'd do better in a small class with some hands on attention. The flip side is that he has 7 other people that are together and 1 that needs a bit more flexibility. It's hard to teach like that and there is nothing wrong at all with needing to move at a different pace.   He shouldn't have chided you at all. I'm sorry you had this experience. How did you find him?
scuba,3ciuee,Gutterlungz1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:02 2015 UTC,I found him through reading reviews on Yelp and various scuba forums. I don't know anyone here in the bay area that got training here. With that being said the instructor I had last night I believe was someone newly hired at the place and wasn't the instructor I was expecting or had been communicating with. He didn't have any reviews.   The instructor is offering me some private lessons to help me more. He's been really understanding after the class.

It will be a good experience to have, you will learn something new and you may learn something about yourself, like ""hey, I  really, really liked the sensation of diving and I will find a way to do it again.""   If you end up one day going on vacation to an area with good diving, even if you haven't dived in a while you may be good to go with a quick refresher (this part is highly personal, some people retain the knowledge and mechanical memory better)."

I've been diving for two thirds of my life, I'm a licensed commercial diver, and sometimes I still find dive centers who ask me to do a compulsory refresher (read: lame) dive. Needless to say, usually these centers lose me as a client, but sometimes there's no alternative. What's funny (in a bad way) is when after that refresher dive they try to make me handle a group of beginners (for free of course)."

scuba,3cfq9a,garuba2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:51:57 2015 UTC,The semi-dry is what we have.  7mm full suit with ocean liner.  The ocean liner helps it slip on easier and stay snug.  We added the wrist and ankle zippers to make getting them on and off easier.  They don't exchange much water which is nice.  We ordered the full suit then added the Ocean Liner as an option.
scuba,3cfq9a,dailytentacle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"With their suites, what is it that makes a semi-dry different from a full suit? On the price list it sounds like all of the semi-dry suits come in two parts. That's not the traditional definition of a semi-dry though (neck, wrist and ankle seals; glued seams)."
scuba,3cfq9a,garuba2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, the Ocean Liner is the big thing.  It lets the suit be a hair snugger while still letting you get in and out of it and move around in it.  Water gets in, but the water exchange is reduced.  I just ordered full wetsuits and added the ocean liner. Works for us."

However, I bet in the hands of a seasoned veteran diver - these could be useful.  In the hands of a novice -- not so much.  With better surface area, and proper technique - it should let you do very fine movement controls via ""sculling"" with just the wrists etc. - and avoid larger sweeping motions. Especially in penetration situations where foot-fin movements are very constrained or not advised (confined spaces) / you want to avoid physical contact or keep motion within the plain of sight (wrecks / caves / reef crevices).   I think many of us have been silted out of wrecks before... even by seasoned divers. This could feasibly prevent that by moving your propulsion control to a more visible plane / line of sight. Not saying it is the best -- but ti could work in tandem and in special situations."

scuba,3cfdl4,tingwong,4,Wed Jul 8 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree on the paralyzed / handicapped part. You're totally right there. I know there are some divers out there who use their hands for these reasons.  I'm not sold on wreck-diving. I just don't don't think it's going to give you the fine control you are imagining or any kind of meaningful propulsion without significantly more surface area. Even then, propulsion with hands requires far more shifting of your center of balance and contorting your body to be workable. Not necessarily desirable things in an overhead environment.   I think time is better spent in learning fine fin control and situational awareness, as I suspect fins will provide better control in 99.9% of situations."

scuba,3cfdl4,engineering_diver,6,Tue Jul 7 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"My husband is paralyzed and uses these to dive. Besides the fact the he uses his arms instead of his legs, you'd never know that he has a disability under the surface. He loves his Darkfins so much! He only wishes they made a thicker option since we do a fair amount of cold water diving."
scuba,3cfdl4,kneecoal,8,Tue Jul 7 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"I actually bought these about a year ago for surfing and general swimming fitness.   They are essentially double thickness dish gloves. Not elastic at all and very restrictive. Extremely uncomfortable to wear.   I don't know what species made the hand mold for the glove, but the fit was horrible. I bought two sizes because my hand fell in between on the sizing chart. The smaller size I couldn't even get on and the bigger size was too big in the finger tips but still so tight in the meaty part of the palm underneath the thumb that it left my hand feeling crushed and bruised after trying to swim.   I contacted customer support and they told me to simply cut the fingertips off and slit the side of the glove by the thumb. I did this and was still too tight and after trying to swim again, the slit turned into a tear up the side.   When I contacted customer support again, I never heard from them.   For diving, just as every other comment points out, you're not supposed to use your hands. Don't get them. For general swimming and surfing, I'd highly advise against these gloves."

These webbed gloves are only for people who like wearing webbed gloves when swimming/snorkeling/free diving/whatever.  I purchased these for my father 4 years ago because he doesn't like to wear fins while he snorkels, and he absolutely loves them.    The material of the glove is flexible and has some amount of stretch to it, but overall it is fragile and shouldn't be used for anything other than simply swimming.  The glove and the webbing are entirely one piece and can be difficult to get on and off, especially when dry."

scuba,3ccfhx,Lanky-Kong,3,Tue Jul 7 05:56:34 2015 UTC,It's more about the long term effects.  Touch a fish you're not eating and it may get sick or behave in a manner that costs it its life; that's a waste of everything.  Eat the fish and you've given it some purpose at least.  That's how I look at it.  Same with hunting - I'll kill varmints and eat deer but I don't go around stomping on frogs or sending arrows at songbirds.

Apparently touching a non protected animal is bad, but touching that unprotected animal and putting it into a collection bag to cook and eat or sell later is perfectly good. This kind of stupid logic is why I downvote all the witch hunt threads and comments. Its against the rules of the site and just stupid.  Last summer Reddit harassed a man for harassing an giant Octopus that had babies. Turns out he was hunting the octopus that was not protected and it in no way had babies. Reddit still tried to continue harassing him even though he had proof that he ate the damn thing. The people on this subreddit can be pathetic sometimes.

There have been a few pretty bad videos but for the most part it's someone petting a fish or something. Not ideal, but it doesn't make them an instant a-hole.  As far as seafood goes, if it's a legal catch diving is probably one of the most environmentally friendly way to catch seafood, so no problems with that."

That guy killed a GPO at a 'dive park' - pretty much the equivalent of shooting a deer on a golf course.

scuba,3ccfhx,SrRoundedbyFools,0,Sat Jul 18 05:59:18 2015 UTC,You are dead wrong about that.  Spear fishing on wrecks is common and another octopus would move into that area quickly.

You don't belong in this sub and if you are a diver I'm guessing you're a cruise ship diver aka 'that guy'.  Here a tip for your kind - there is no right or left fin, they're the same.   There was no 'wreck' there and it's not a spearfishing area.  The GPO's come out and interact with divers because divers often bring crab as offerings.  The GPO's are acclimated to divers.   The issue isn't hunting GPO's in the Puget Sound (although the last surveys are over 30 years old) but where he hunted it.    If he wanted to go out with his buddies and dive off a boat at some location he'd found then very well but in the Puget Sound the practice is the dive sites are public and the only thing you take out is trash.

However, having seen crustaceans of all shapes and sizes getting along perfectly fine with missing limbs, I daresay you are blowing the negligible effects of my brief interaction with this creature way out proportion.  Also, humans don't need to eat animals, and by that line of reasoning, consuming a lobster is every bit as trivial a reason to disturb it as taking a picture with it, even in the worst case scenario that simply picking it up for a picture guaranteed its death. Actually, even if the lobster died because of what I did, its body wouldn't disappear, it would be eaten by another aquatic animal which, unlike humans, does need to eat other animals to survive."

You can make road + ferry trips to these islands.  Indonesia and Philippines offer a plethora of diving options as well for both on-land and live-aboard diving.  Maldives is 4-5 hours by flight away from Singapore and it's famous for its pelagic life. But it's also very expensive for accommodation and diving."

You might want to spend more than 3 to 5 days in there though, considering the number of amazing dive sites.  Komodo should be considered as well, though I have yet to be there personally. But I've heard that the dive sites there are pretty fantastic.  Like others have mentioned, Sipadan. You never know what you may get there, but tons of turtles and white tips are pretty much a guarantee. The huge schools of jacks and barracudas are pretty much alwasy there too.  Bunaken in Manado can be another option, where it's mostly wall dives with schools of fish, eels and turtles. If you like a little macro you can always make a trip down to Lembeh, which can be arranged by whichever dive resort you're staying at.  Malapascua in Philippines gives you a chance to see thresher sharks, and then from there you can move on to Moalboal, where sardine runs can occur (no sharks though!).  I wouldn't really recommend Tioman for a leisure dive trip though. Overcrowded dive sites, with not-so-good visibility and average marine life. You'll find a lot more dive students than leisure divers there. However, Aur/Dayang is a different story right now, due to the high marine park fees. Clear waters and abundant marine life.

I just got a new camera and was testing it on some very tiny things and it didn't disappoint. This little guy was about the size of my thumbnail and the camera captured him perfectly.  For photo nerds, the camera is an Olympus TG-4 with the PT-056 housing. Depth was about 20 feet. Shot without a flash in jpeg mode (I didn't figure out raw until after the dive). The camera itself doesn't need a housing for such shallow dives, but I bought it for an upcoming dive trip that will have me frequently doing dives more than 80ft deep, so having the water resistant camera will provide some smallish amount of protection in the case of a flooded enclosure.

Im trying to figure out how these books differ from some others, is there something behind it or just personal preference.  P.S. Im not saying they are bad, Im sure at least some of them are great and maybe the best in their category. But many of these subjects have multiple books about them and I'm asking who decided that these are the best ones."
scuba,3cbz01,eanx100,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"Suggested by whom? Some certifying organization, a school or by you?    Does it matter? :)  This is a collection of books recommended to me by various technical dive trainers like Jill Heinerth, John Chatterton, Bernie Chowdhury, and others.   But many of these subjects have multiple books about them and I'm asking who decided that these are the best ones.   No one is claiming they are the best- just good reads. That said- several of them are unquestionably good books:  Deco for Divers and Diving Physiology in Plain English are some of the best lay texts on decompression.  Shadow Divers and On the Bottom have been critically acclaimed.  The Six Skills and Other Discussions and Saying Alive were both written by Steve Lewis and are widely considered to be ""must reads"".  Caverns Measureless to Man is written by Sheck Exley. It's basically the Genesis of technical diving.  The two AirSpeed Press books are the original homebuilder books on Oxygen and Regulator maintenance. Regulator Savvy is another good book on regulators.  If you have better recommendations- by all means suggest them. This post was not meant to be a definitive list and I'd welcome other recommendations."

No I dont have any recommendations, I havent really read any diving related books, since I havent been reading too much for pleasure lately. I was just interested if there are some strong professionals recommending these, since that at least for me, means a bit more in a field like this than the fact that someone online liked them.

Either way- don't take my word for it- take a look at the Amazon reviews and do some searching and you'll find that most of those books are highly regarded.  The ""good stories"" section is much more personal preference than the others. Some people will love Fatal Depth, and other will hate it. Some will prefer Last Dive and others will prefer Shadow Divers."

Ideally looking to learn there, or maybe caribbean if that woukd be comparable.   Learn where you are going to work. Each location has unique challenges and until you've worked as a Divemaster for a while- you won't have the experience to handle unexpected situations in a totally different environment.   I have tried diving before and i loved it.   Ahh ok- it seemed like you'd literally never done it before hence the confusion.   I know that its nothing like doing it as a job but I am a complete water baby and would like a job that allows me to be in that environment. I surf (used to be competitive), windsurf, wakeboard, basically anything waterbased.    Water baby means you'll like diving. DM is a job and it involves plenty of crappy work (lugging and filling tanks, cleaning the boat, washing and rinsing gear, etc.). You also have to be a customer service person. No matter how stupid or rude the clients are- you need to be able to keep a smile on your face and get them sorted. If you will be working with students a lot- you need to love teaching.  I'm not trying to dissuade you- I just want you to understand the reality of diving. It's fun- but it's also work. Some people end up not just hating the job- but diving as well simply because the job was so much worse than they expected.  As for recommendations- I can recommend a few places in Florida- but I've never done any professional level training outside the US. There are several others here, however, who have. If you search through old posts (hint: use google not reddit's search function- site:reddit.com <search terms> in google.com) you should be able to find more information as well."

Learning to properly plan a dive, deal with unexpected issues, and maintain situational awareness are the hard parts."

Gas switches are incredibly boring- it's basically grab the tank, verify the contents label, trace the hose to the regulator, show the tank to your buddy (so they can verify tank contents and regulator/hose combo), switch to that regulator, perform the gas switch in your computer. That's basically all there is to it.  Doing it right, doing it right every time, and doing it well- that requires a lot of practice."

scuba,3cdrmi,Rashaverak,3,Tue Jul 7 03:05:22 2015 UTC,"Wife is suggesting that because we haven't been in a while... that we should just charter two dives or so and not push it.   I think going on a charter is ""pushing it"" more than doing AOW with knowledgeable, direct supervision. I'm working on my AOW now (just got back from a night dive) and it's a piece of cake.   From what I understand, AOW was designed so that you can jump right into it from OW. In my class for this last dive, there were two old guys who havent been out in 10+ years. All went well for one guy, but the other guy was fat and was struggling to keep his head above water on the shore dive out. I think his BC wasnt providng enough lift to keep him up or he was overweighted or something. Then his snorkel tip kept going under surf so the instructor had to help hold him up because his reg was routed between his BC and tank haha."
scuba,3cdrmi,flappycooter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:19:50 2015 UTC,"Haha, oh man that sounds shitty for that guy.  Thanks for the advice, I think I'm on the same page as you. I probably should have clarified though that the charters are guided so we'd still have a life-line to a real expert. Still though, I agree, it's not like AOW is a rescue or DM course. It's still the kiddy-pool as far as i can tell."
scuba,3cdrmi,Barefootjunglegirl,2,Tue Jul 7 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"sorry mate I disagree. getting an AOW for the label/ new cert and value is not the right way to do it. Take a refresher (it might even be mandatory to dive with the company if you tell them you have not been diving for over a year), or go for a couple of shake down dives before you jump into a coarse. Its great that you ""get"" diving and you understand all the material but things like buoyancy and  comfort underwater only occur with practice. And diving in a new environment - Maui is very different than Victoria - Cold vs warm water, visibility, current.. etc.. different partners.. is a different setup. So get comfortable and allow your body to remember the skills you learned in your OW coarse before you sign up to learn more.  Its exciting that you are traveling to Maui and you should definitely try to dive but don't jump into a coarse right away if you have very few dives after OW and haven't been in the water for a couple of years.   I've been a Dive Master for 7 years, and an Instructor for 2 .. Keep in mind that most diving centres pay a commission to the number of certifications done per pay period, this is another reason why at facilities people are encouraged to just take the higher up level coarse. PM if you have any questions."
scuba,3cdrmi,Barefootjunglegirl,2,Tue Jul 7 05:56:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, will conciser.  I'm there for two weeks so I've got the time to hit a refresher early and leave a window near the middle if that goes well. Probably a wise route.  To clarify, when I say I ""get"" diving, I mean to say that while I watched the other 5 people in our course flail around and stir up the bottom I was content to sit a foot off the mud and barely move a fin. Controlling my buoyancy with the speed of my breathing/keeping the BCD in that mid spot between full and empty lungs felt completely natural. The instruction set and number of factors to keep in mind, even with a 7/7mm suit/john and ridiculous weights on wasn't really rocket science.  I have a good head for staying calm and actively processing my situation.  This isn't to brag, it's to factor my fairly won place on the bell curve.  From what I've seen, PADI is designed to take your average mid-western soda-fiends and let them dive without killing themselves.  I just don't feel that the mean standard for dive training according to PADI is much of a challenge.  I could be wrong, this could be misplaced hubris, but from what I've experienced of diving so far things happen very slowly and there aren't as many factors to monitor as many other sports and activities I've been successful in. That leads me to think that I'd be okay pushing what's typical and coming out a winner.  Time efficiency is less important than safety, yes, but it's not discounted altogether.  Where are you instructing from? What's your take on tropical vs cold water as far as complexity?  I could see that maybe in tropical water I may forget what I'm doing easier due to comfort and overlook something."
scuba,3cdrmi,JJWenzell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:29:24 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to read that you are comfortable and confident underwater. PADI does simplify everything, and I had to adapt to its different methodology and teachings since I didn't learn how to dive PADI but later became a PADI professional when I started working in diving. In recreational diving I hope everything is slow and smooth, however when something goes wrong it escalates into a horrid situation very quickly - ex a fast assent. Permanent injuries and death are not far fetched. Yes I agree it certainly is not like other sports.   I have come across many OW divers with more experience that were far better divers than AOW divers with minimal experience, I was commenting that since you haven't been in the water for a long time take it easy, do some diving before you jump into a coarse. Practice putting your equipment together/taking apart and get familiar with your rental gear before jumping in. Getting a new certification and a new card doesn't always mean you are a winner. Better to work on yourself and diving skills in aim to improve, and have fun too! 2 weeks is a nice long vacation, if you dive a bit and feel you are comfortable and enjoying it then for sure go for the coarse, much wiser path this way:) .   I have worked mostly in tropical waters, but have been diving in Canada and South Australia where the water can be 12 deg or -2 deg. Dry suits become like second nature with practice, and are more comfortable than 14mm wetsuit. You will feel way more comfortable in a rash guard or 3mm than a 7/7mm and yes you take far less weights. Many argue that tropical water diving is easier because of the conditions. Ex visibility (most often) is better, you are carrying less equipment, you typically don't need much planning ahead too. Ex you won't wear gloves, so kit up etc is easier. Entry and exit from water normally easier. Most times you follow a guide and don't have to navigate yourself.. Colourful reefs and marine life in tropical waters are distractions too, so a common honest mistake I've come across is forgetting to check your pressure gauge as regularly. However clearing your mask will feel refreshing and not stunning, and generally when you are not cold you consume less air.   I believe it just depends what you are most used to diving in, and it typically (diver dependent of coarse) it only takes a handful of dives to adjust from cold to tropical & similarly with fresh and salt water switches. This being said I personally enjoy warm water diving more. Have fun on vacation. And remember to plan the dive and dive the plan :)"
scuba,3cdrmi,Jim3535,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I completely hear where you're coming from on the ""credentials =/= skills"" front. I've seen that pitfall more than a few times in other sports, and you're completely right.  I'm not above falling into the trap of looking at the PADI courses as a checklist, they sort of designed it that way. But yes, clearly that can create a false impression of skill which is dangerous.  Will scale back expectations and just plan to have some fun i think."

For certain types of diving, it seemed to be ideal ... but I don't do caves or a lot of shore diving. It seems like a bit less useful for boat dives in typically rough water.

Highly unlikely, I.E. struck by lightning unlucky..  2 factors to consider;   1) The ones to worry about (box jellyfish and irukandji) aren't in season, which generally runs across the wet season, Sep/Oct to Mar/Apr.   2) They are general coastal anyway, and their breeding areas are around the mangrove areas.  For what it's worth, I did Spirit of Freedom at the end of Dec last year, peak part of the stinger season and did my dives generally in a rashie and boardshorts. That was Osprey and the ribbon reefs. I did ProDive the previous year, over new years, to the outer barrier reef, peak stinger season, and did the same (shorts and rashie), but I think someone else may have had a sting, which isn't common, but the current can take them anywhere in the middle of wet season/cyclone season.   I grew up in Cairns thru the '90s and still go back annually to see family, and the stinger season is getting longer, and they do appear on the outer reef areas more these days than they used to, but they're not in big numbers, even in the middle of the season, out there. At this time of year, no real issues."

Maybe someone else will chime in to say they've had similar experiences, but in my mind there's nothing about treading water that everyone can't do, especially someone of your size. If you were 100kg and 5% bodyfat I could see that being more difficult, but I was your size as a teenager and I've never had an issue with it. So my suggestion is to check out some Youtube videos and practise."
scuba,3c8uqu,TacoExcellence,5,Mon Jul 6 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"First off- relax. If you go into this thinking you're going to sink then you're going to tense up and you will sink.  Second- there are several ways to do this. Laying on your back, drownproofing, treading water, and combinations of these. Some people just ""swim"" in tiny circles. If you do want to tread water- then technique is critical. The eggbeater method isn't just about moving your legs in a circle- foot and knee position are important to generate the most lift with the least effort. It takes practice- and there is only so much a coach can help when it comes to treading water. The best thing you can do is hit the pool and try several different methods and see what works.  Whatever happens- you need to be comfortable treading water. If the boat has to weigh anchor to pick up someone drifting away and having an emergency- are you going to be able to keep your head above water? Treading water for 10 minutes is the bare minimum. Realistically you should be able to do it for 20 minutes or more just as easily."

scuba,3c8uqu,bbybgs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"The lift-generating motions to me are similar to breast stroke. Maybe try swimming/getting used to that, slowing your pace down, and eventually going from more horizontal to more vertical. You can keep up a slow breast stroke for a pretty long time regardless. Might be a starting point."
scuba,3c8uqu,bbybgs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:48:54 2015 UTC,I often see people do a very slow breast stroke but keep their head above water the entire time. Would you happen to know the technique in doing this?
scuba,3c8uqu,bbybgs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Putting your head into the water in breast stroke is to reduce drag and increasing speed, and isn't that relevant for your purposes. But from this, it sounds like maybe you haven't had much training in swimming, so if you're struggling you might consider asking your nearest community pool about private instruction. Adults do it all the time, and I think it's pretty affordable in the short term. If they can teach kids to swim and tread water well, they can probably teach you. If that doesn't sound good to you or you find it's not within your budget, you might want to just continue researching, look around youtube for videos/breakdowns of treading water, and practice. Maybe get a friend to watch and critique you, and/or throw on some goggles and watch how they do it."

scuba,3c8fug,memercopter,4,Sun Jul 5 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"First off- you should have dive insurance if you are going to be a diver. DAN is pretty much the best choice for dive accident insurance.  Losing a trip due to an accident or injury would be covered by trip insurance which you linked to.  That said:  ""One thing I am worried about is I recently perforated my eardrum, and while it looks like it will have healed before I go diving again, if it gets re-perforated during lessons I don't want to be SOL with non-refundable dues.""  WTF is wrong with you? If you aren't 100% certain your ear is completely healed stay the hell out of the water. If re-perforating it is even remotely a consideration- stop what you're doing and re-evaluate your priorities."
scuba,3c8fug,stds9tng,3,Sun Jul 5 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Re: ""WTF is wrong with you?""  I have never been diving before. The perf was minor and resealed in a day. It will have been over a month since then and I don't imagine it can get much stronger after that. It's a tiny membrane, not my femur. It's not like I can go to a doctor for it. I only live in the richest country in the world.  My specific question, however, is if I can get the class refunded as opposed to the ""trip"". I dont think I'll be losing my whole vacation to an injury, just the classes. Does ""trip"" mean ""dive sessions"" or ""whole vacation""?  Thanks for the advice though. DAN it is."
scuba,3c8fug,randomfrequency,3,Sun Jul 5 22:56:10 2015 UTC,Only an ENT is qualified to say if it's healed or not.
scuba,3c8fug,stds9tng,3,Mon Jul 6 01:17:05 2015 UTC,"It will have been over a month since then and I don't imagine it can get much stronger after that. It's a tiny membrane, not my femur. It's not like I can go to a doctor for it. I only live in the richest country in the world.   Don't fuck around with your ears. You need to see an ENT. You're going to have to fill out a medical questionnaire before you can do a class and one of the questions is related to ear problems. If you answer yes- and you should- then you'll need to see a doctor for clearance anyway.  If your eardrum ruptures while you're diving it can cause vertigo and that can seriously screw you up- not to mention puts the rest of the class at risk because now the instructor has to deal with you. It will also greatly increase the chance of an infection if the perforation occurs underwater.   My specific question, however, is if I can get the class refunded as opposed to the ""trip"". I dont think I'll be losing my whole vacation to an injury, just the classes. Does ""trip"" mean ""dive sessions"" or ""whole vacation""?   That depends on the specific insurance you go through. DAN is who to go through for ""dive insurance"". Lots of places offer trip insurance besides DAN however.  DAN's trip insurance covers trip interruption. If you're going on a tropical vacation and suddenly can't go in the water any more I'm pretty sure this qualifies as a trip ""interruption"".  Having said all that- the only people that can answer that definitively are DAN themselves. Call them up and ask."

For photos (not video) you really won't be able to do much with a gopro. They really are dedicated video cameras. But in general for photos and video, don't shoot from behind an animal, try to capture behaviors, shoot up at an animal if you can (or do something else to give the photo more depth). There are lots of other tips that you can find online. underwater photography guide is a good place to poke around."
scuba,3c6l0u,ScubaFred,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"Hi, if you want to edit later, then you could enable ProTune. But it will add some extra work later on. Go for 1080p if your computer is fast enough for it. Core i5-i7 CPU. And don't go for high frame rate unless as you need all the light you can get for each frame. 29.97 if you live in NTSC (Europe) part of the world, or 25p if you live in PAL (Europe). 24P is also OK. I keep my on Medium zoom so it's not as warped and wide, but that's me. Some like that look. Do some tests on land first so you get used to the camera.

May i ask two things, why the low frame rate, does that just not make the footage smoother???? And second, what is needed to be done after having put on protune in the editing phase as i have seen some people say that it can be a lot of work. Thanks!"
scuba,3c6l0u,ScubaFred,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"First Q: You need all the light you can get, if you set it to 60fps then it only has a 1/60th of a second to capture light, but if you set it to 29.97 the GoPro has twice as much time to gather light (and avoid low light noise) most diving is ""low light"" as the water is blocking the light. High FPS is best when you have a lot of light, and want to do some slow-mo. ProTune: you need to do color grading in order to get a good picture = it adds more work. And the default (without pro-tune) is good enough. This is my personal opinion as I don't want to spend a lot of time getting a good color. What is better is to also get a Red-Filter (or cyan depending of colors), so the colors become more natural. As the go-Pro can easily lose the white balance and go full green or blue. The filters doesn't really ""add color"" but more helps with the white balance. Here is a good video explaining this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfqaCNz20Q8 If you get one, try to get a cheap one as you easily scratch them. I also recommend getting one you can take off as you get closer to the surface And you have different colors depending of what type of water, and how deep. Cyan is for green water, yellow for shallow blue water, orange for a bit deeper, and red for deep 20+m. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIZPavSbxLE"

Lobsters, Crab, (Green fucking crab, feed them to lobsters), Skates, Cod, Sculpin, Sea Raven, Jellyfish, Squid, Wolf Fish, the list goes on.   Feel free to PM me and if I am in around in September (depending on school) I would be happy to meet up and intro you to some dive buddies and take you out.   Apologies for the wall of text.

If you got certified and subsequently made no dives you need a complete refresher course, if not a total recertification.  Ignore the laborious advice you get in this forum."

scuba,3c4hzu,misplacedyank,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"My Advice: Keep Breathing!  Just kidding.. but in all honesty, there is no right or wrong answer, and many people will advise you to take some kind of course or refresher. But is that required?  For example: the courses teach you a lot of the theory that is good to have in the back of your head, but it doesn't really affect your diving in practical terms. Few recreational people dive off tables these days, or need to calculate pressure groups, etc. If you have a computer, it does all the thinking for you.   I think that a quick refresher of all the equipment and communication signals should be plenty to get you back in the water, especially if you are conservative / cautious on your first few dives. I don't think you need to spend hours going over the material again.   A lot of dive shops offer a refresher dive, which is only a bit more expensive than you'd pay for a normal boat dive, but includes extra attention paid to you buy a divemaster and possibly a quick 20-30 minute refresher on the equipment and other thigns."

While this particular instance of strapping a camera on the turtle seems so be on the edge, putting GPS trackers attached to turtles has been used for years to track and preserve their habitats (source: http://www.marinelife.org/track). This video is probably created to create awareness in WWF's barrier reef campaign; one could argue that this momentarily strapping things to turtles is ""better"" than strapping a GPS logger to them."

The thing with red filters is that they are not going to make everything magically better. In surface or shallow water it will just look too red. For example Gopro recommends their red filter to be used from 4.5 to 21.3 meters (15 to 70 feet). If Im not confused by the video, it looks like most of it is in the shallow water and the turtle is visiting surface for air. There is parts where the red filter probably would have helped, but I would think they didnt want to stress the turtle with multiple Gopros or switching configuration in the middle."

scuba,3c0vil,NATH2099,2,Fri Jul 3 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"A key point when you are learning to dive: clearing your mask.  Typically, this is one of the last skills of that circuit, because the instructor wants everyone to be relaxed. The problem is that your body (and head) become acclimated to the water, whilst your face (protected by the mask) does not. So, when you crack the mask, you feel the shock of cold water and take a rapid breath.  You are taught to breathe slowly and easily to avoid creating turbulence in the air hose. When you try and breathe quickly, you actively prevent yourself from getting all the air you demand.  The cumulative effect is that you are blind (most new divers close their eyes doing this drill) have just had a shock (cold sensation) tried to breathe quickly and couldn't. The result is usually panic that sends the student to the surface. You can prevent this with one small change. When you are about to crack the mask, breathe in, and then breathe out slowly as you actually crack it. It is so simple, but few instructors add it to the list."

scuba,3c0vil,baldwadc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem swimming for as long as I can remember.  The first time I got in the ocean, 2004 maybe, I had a major panic attack because of my irrational fear of sharks.  All of my teeth started to hurt, I had a hard time breathing, I got a massive headache, and I got out of the water.  I vowed I would never go back in.  A couple of years ago, I went on a cruise with my girlfriend.  During our stop in Aruba, she (an OW certified diver at the time) wanted to dive.  I agreed to go on a discovery dive with her.  I figured it would be something that I could probably power through, so that we could at least do it together.  The first 5-10 minutes were hell.  And then... it all went away.  My breathing returned to normal, and there was just nothing wrong, at all.  It was just purely amazing, like nothing I could have ever imagined.  I went on another discovery dive with her a few months later, in Hawaii.  That was it, I was hooked.  A year and a half ago, I got my OW certification.  A couple of months ago I finished my AOW, Nitrox, and Drysuit.  Rescue Diver is coming up soon.  I'm on my way to instructor.  I guess the TL;DR version of this is to take it slow, at your own pace, don't feel rushed or pressured, and I think, like what happened with me, it'll all just go away, and amazing experiences will overpower anything else."
scuba,3c0vil,sdbarker99,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:37:41 2015 UTC,"I'm 28 myself and I was in the same boat as you. I'm going for my open water certification class next week so my advice is more geared towards general swimming and water comfort.    Take your time and progress at your own pace. Please, please take your time and not rush things. The most major cause of accidents is due to a diver panicking underwater.   For me I started out with beginner adult swimming lessons. I felt comfortable enough to dog paddle around in shallow water but not being submerged at all. The small class I was with was 2 instructors and 6 students. They started off us really easy and did a lot of exercises and techniques to help me be comfortable in the water that I can practice at any time.   The class started off slow. The first session was just having us stick our face in the water in the shallow side. Just learning to relax and be okay looking down in the pool and having your face in it. We then learned how to float. We then moved onto learning how to kick properly. We then moved onto freestyle and backstroke swimming.   You will definitely want to be used to all sorts of things that happen when you swim. At first I would panic whenever water went into my nose and down my throat or if I started to inhale in some water. Through a lot of self practice both of those things aren't as huge of a deal for me anymore. I've learned how to deal with water going down my noise - its muscle memory now. I now spit out water I start to inhale and keep going. IMO you definitely need to be at least at that comfort point before starting scuba diving.   I then recommend buying your own mask and snorkel and maybe fins before the class. I bought all 3 and its really helping my comfort level. Buy them at a local dive store so you get fitted correctly for the mask and fins. Safely, with a buddy or a lifeguard watching out I just started off sticking my face in the water and just breathing. It felt really weird at first for me and started my anxiety. It took me about 30 minutes of slow, deep, continuous breathing through the snorkel before I started calming down.   Next I practiced snorkel clearing safely in shallow water. I started out first dipping the snorkel then clearing it. I progressed to dunking my whole head & snorkel under water then clearing it. You will definitely want to be comfortable doing this skill as I'd imagine clearing a scuba regulator is similar.   It took me a year to work up on my own just dog paddling until I started swimming regularly and took the swmming class. It took me another couple months before I felt ready to sign up for the scuba class.   I then moved onto snorkel swimming. With the snorkel and fins it felt amazing and peaceful. I didn't have to turn to breathe and I could just swim swim swim super easy. I'm now really looking forward to my class and becoming certified!   I hope that helps."

scuba,3bxlvu,I_want_candyy,2,Fri Jul 3 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"Years ago I had a windsurfing wetsuit that I used in San Francisco Bay that was 5mm in the torso, and 3mm in the arms and legs. When I took up diving, and did my check-out dives in Monterey Bay in January, I froze my ass off. Then I went diving a few months later in the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara and had to keep it unzipped to keep from overheating. I could never win with that fucking thing."
scuba,3bxlvu,obidieboyeaux,2,Fri Jul 3 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt - it's been a few years since I've been surfing.  I would say it's probably fine to do both, but you're better off buying a scuba wetsuit to go surfing in. The scuba ones are made of a much better neoprene (I think Waterproof has some information explaining how neoprene is made/why it's better) and most importantly, the seals. I am 99% sure that the surfing suits don't have the seals or at least higher quality seals that wetsuits do. Now, not all scuba wetsuits do have the (just above) ankle/wrist seals, but the better ones tend to.  But I'm sure it's fine. Just find a comfy scuba suit, bite the bullet on that, then go surf in it! Also, Scubapro has been making slightly colorful suits lately. Maybe check out Waterproof. I've seen some neat, but very expensive stuff from them."
scuba,3bxlvu,doombuggy110,2,Fri Jul 3 15:32:57 2015 UTC,The main difference between surfing and diving wetsuits is where they are reenforced with extra material (like the knees and elbows for a lot of diving suits) and double stitching.   There isn't any reason to not use the same suit for both.
scuba,3bxlvu,eanx100,3,Fri Jul 3 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"A good surf suit is super flexy, a good scuba suit resists compression. They take a very different material. Any compromise means you have a suit that does both jobs badly.  They are hardly expensive..."
scuba,3bxlvu,nigelh,2,Fri Jul 3 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, Bare Elastek are scuba suits, and they're insanely flexible and stretchy. So that's an example of a compromise that will do one job very well, and the other probably equally well (haven't surfed mine)."

scuba,3bxs1k,UniqueScuba,2,Fri Jul 3 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"There's still no free lunch.  The splits are easier on your joints at the expense of having less of a grab on the water. They are what they are and you have nothing to apologies for and nothing you have to ""work up to""  The rigid fins are also nothing special. They have a more direct action in the water so they're more responsive. The down side is that every ounce of force on the fins has an equal force on your joints.  Nobody on the internet can tell you what fin is right for you, any more than we can tell you what you want for dinner.  Try a couple of styles in the pool and see which you like."

I live in a large metropolitan area and found someone on CL that had a pair if Scubapro Twinjets in my size that were essentially new in the box for $50.  Decided I could resell them for same or more.  To me, they seem like a great compromise.  I have knee pain and am somewhat overweight and started out with some exaggerated, very long spilt fins that a LDS sold me.  But with the Twinjets  I can frog kick with ease, I do a lot of underwater photography, and can hold my own in all but the strongest currents.  Since I do not aspire to graduate to tech or cave diving, I think these are ""just right"" for me.  Good luck!"
scuba,3bxs1k,nigelh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:36:35 2015 UTC,If you will be using a frog kick I would recommend the IST Pro Power fins. They are the same exact design the DiveRite fins are based off of.

scuba,3bxs1k,texasguy911,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:05:42 2015 UTC,"Update: I went to another shop that had a much wider selection. The first shop I was at only had 3 kinds of paddle fins. The other shop had open heel Mares Avanti Super-Chargers and they have a generous return policy as long as I only use them in chlorine pools. I tried out both fins. Right now the splits are much easier for me to use. I'm faster in them, doing one 25m lap in 21 seconds, while the paddles I started off doing a lap in 35 seconds and got it down to 28 seconds. I don't think I'm properly kicking with the paddles at all. I think I have proper form with the splits from being used to freestyle swimming.   The only thing I don't like about the splits is treading water upright. I feel like I'm sinking more with them. In that situation the paddle fins feel a lot better. Just one or two gentle kicks keeps me upright.   I think I'll bring both to my class and work with my instructor to see which one works better for me."

Regulator:  Legend is a decent enough reg.  ABS octo ... I hate those things. Plasticy, poor performance ...   BCD  Hate the elevator switch (yeah, someone will say how great they are)  Too many plastic D-rings on the Pearl.  Both are over-priced for what they are.  All the gear listed will work, and be ok.

scuba,3bxrx7,CanadianDiver,2,Fri Jul 3 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"Based on previous ownership, I despise all Oceanic gear as it is generally poorly made and prone to failure.  The i3 system is dangerous gimmick that makes you less safe.   Get a real inflator.   Get a real octo.   Don't get the stupid elevator lever.  Aqualung makes good regs."
scuba,3bxrx7,eanx100,2,Fri Jul 3 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"not a fan of the i3 system or abs octo. get a full size 2nd stage instead and stick to a regular inflator. if you aren't diving cold water, the core is plenty of reg and you could get a better octo with the price difference.  take a look at the zuma if diving warm water and balance if cold water for aqualung bc's. try out an apeks or hollis bp/w if the shop has them.  even with 30 percent off, a zeagle express tech/brigade or DSS bp/w would be a better choice imo.  you will want a spg and a compass too. i would get a cheaper dive computer without AI, but that's a personal preference."
scuba,3bxrx7,runsongas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"I'd stay away from the computer with the transmitter, stick to a conventional air gauge. I don't know about the i3 system, I'm a fan of aqualung and all; but the standard inflater hose is a tried and true method I don't see any reason to mess with it. That being said, if given the chance to dive with an i3 BC to try out I would try it just to see. But not sure I would spend the extra money on it when I could get a better item with the money I saved.   I have and like my ABS Octo but it's just an Octo and its only job is to work when you need it too and stay out of the way (but within easy reach) when you don't. I guess the complaints are it's mostly plastic and its a built at a silly funny (120*) angle.  But it breathes good enough, in my opinion.   That's a nice reg!"

You're going to build muscle memory that will fail you if you ever have to borrow/rent someone else's BC, or buy a new BC that doesn't offer it, or get into technical diving where it doesn't exist.  Air integration is fine- right up until it doesn't work. I had a transmitter cut out several years ago when doing a non technical dive to 120' with a borrowed rig. Ended the dive early and was obviously fine- but I decided I was never going to do another dive beyond 30' without a real SPG. Knowing that- I could either keep my brass and glass SPG and buy a transmitter- or save the money on the transmitter and buy a better compass/slate/whatever.  The Legend LX is a great regulator but the ABS octo is possibly the worst second stage ever made in the history of diving. Get a standard octo to use as a second stage. The person most likely to be breathing off it is you- so why would you want to deal with a second rate regulator?"
scuba,3bwt6m,Freshcom40,3,Thu Jul 2 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the best diving I did in Thailand was probably in Koh Lipe, but of course a liveaboard to Similan islands was awesome too, it was just way longer ago so my memory isnt that fresh.   In Koh Lipe, the marine life was amazing. The amount of colourful corals was amazing. We saw a seahorse, mantis shrimp if Im not mistaken, a grouper larger than myself and bunch of other cool stuff. The water was so clear. Island is quite small and cool. Not the easiest place to reach tho. In there I used Satun dive tour, which was a nice small company, diving from longtail boats.  Diving in Koh Tao is not as good, but still quite good. I really love the island and Im definitely going back, I went there 5 times in the 10 months I stayed in Bangkok. A lot of divers around, also parties and stuff, and the sound of clinking scuba tanks in the morning is like music to my ears (so many dive operations). In Koh Tao my pick is Koh Tao Divers, a great smaller shop (in Koh Tao scale) with a lot of tec diving too. Koh Tao is affordable for training and there is some easy and good spots for different kinds of training, like Buoyancy world and the Sattakut wreck, which was sunk there for this specific reason.  I did my advanced some years back in Racha islands, from the Scubacat ""liveaboard"" (summer season, the boat was just anchored at Racha). The diving wasnt the best, but the setting was awesome for a 2 day course, since it acted like a liveaboard.  Koh Phi Phi was cool, saw a leopard shark and turtles there, but not my top pick still. I did my dives with Barracuda.  If I was just thinking about the best diving (like for a short trip focused only on diving), Id go to Koh Lipe or a liveaboard, but overall I think I will be going back to Koh Tao when I get to go back to Thailand (Diving, friends, some partying and maybe a divemaster internship).  Edit. Added the last sentence in the Koh Tao part."

Compared to Tulamben in Bali, its not as great but not completely in a different class either.

You don't want to fight a current. You go with it.   Practice your buoyancy.  Practice good ascend and descend. Know how to do negative entry. Remember to stay calm no matter what.  Make sure all your gauges are tucked in and no hose is sticking out too far. Always carry these safety tools all the time: a 6 foot DSMB (Practice how to deploy it from depth using finger spool), a strong and long burning  dive light/strobe, a signal mirror, and a diver whistle. Learn about down current and how to survive it. Always be in good physical and mental condition (no late night partying before diving, remember to hydrate yourself at all time, always get enough rest, etc). Listen to your guide's dive briefing. Choose a good dive center. Get a diver's insurance. There is no deco chamber in Komodo."

So far I'm collecting names from people who've been there (including you) but it's mostly for Bali. Also I trust dive centres and instructors but...

scuba,3butrx,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,2,Thu Jul 2 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"There is no training for down current. Just do a google search about it and read about people's experience and try to learn from them. Some people say you should try to cling on the wall/bottom (most down current take place near wall/drop off). Some people say you should try to swim away from the wall and inflate your BCD.   I tend to go with the first and I also sometimes bring a reef hook when I know a particular dive site is prone to getting down current. A   Regarding how to spot a bad dive center, I usually stay away from: 1. Places that charge low prices for diving (substantially lower than the average market price).  2. Places that put too many divers under one dm.  3. Places that dismiss safety concerns brought up by prospective clients (""oh that site is okay for newbie, don't worry, there are lots of other divers in the water).  4. Places that have old/not well maintained equipment.   To do:    Ask about their procedure for emergencies. Ask about their safety record. A good place will have no problem with anyone asking about these things.  Feel out the diving staff. I tend to be wary of people who are cocky, dismissive of potential dangers, promise you all the good things, etc.    Also, buy a dive whistle. It's cheap."
scuba,3butrx,tokekcowboy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"As far as number nine goes, depending on your itinerary, a lot of the dive shops in Bali have connections with dive shops in other parts of Indonesia.  If you come to Bali first, you can find a dive shop that you're comfortable with, it is likely that either the shop or a DM can hook you up with good people in Komodo and the Gilis too.  And as you're looking at dive sites, consider a day trip from Bali to Nusa Penida too.  It's great diving there, and you should be at the beginning of mola-mola season, so your odds of seeing mola-mola (ocean sunfish) and mantas are pretty decent.

I saw a bunch of people snorkeling from Gili Air's beach, which is very accessible but I don't know if there's much to see that close to shore.  On the Gilis we stayed at the north end of Gili Air (at ""Nelly Homestay""; we were on a budget and were very happy with our bungalow and the included breakfast) and got certified with Manta Dive Gili Air (also very happy with them).  When we dove at NP, we stayed on Lembongan (the adjacent island). It was more interesting than the Gilis in terms of seeing genuine local culture, but there are fewer land-based activities/worthwhile restaurants there. We dove with Big Fish and were reasonably happy with them—some of the equipment was a little worn but nothing major and I don't have much rental experience to compare against.

scuba,3butrx,Y-mir,3,Thu Jul 2 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with JOHNYOSS4RI4N's recommendations.  Also suggest you remember this simple acronym:  OODA, which stands for: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.  It's a good way to keep your head in dicey situations.  Observe what is the external situation (current, depth, air remaining, presence of other divers, etc.).  Orient yourself to the situation (is this an emergency, do I need to ascend or just go with the current, is my buoyancy OK, is all my equipment OK, can my buddy help, etc.?).  Decide what course of action is best, given the situation and my state (adjust buoyancy, continue the dive, check equipment, seek buddy assistance, abort the dive, etc.).  Act (carry out what you've decided).  This helps to avoid panic, which is the most deadly of all dangers for divers."
scuba,3bsgsj,skugler,4,Wed Jul 1 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"Yikes!  Is the tank rated for that or is it overfilled?  I get my LP95's ""cave-filled"" to about 3500psi (~240 bar), but rarely have I seen them top out much more than 3600 after they've cooled.  Plus they drop a bit once you hop in the water."

scuba,3bsgsj,nigelh,3,Thu Jul 2 08:48:17 2015 UTC,"I like 300bar kit. I have a 3L/300bar pony, my doubles were 10L/300bar and my deep water bailouts for the rebreather are 12L/300bar.  When I started on 300s, in the later 1990s, I got a lot of flack about getting good nitrox and trimix fills so I published proper blending software  on the web and it was all 'Wow!! New!!' even if it did use hundred year old physics. Now anybody writing blending software can do it which is nice.  The snag is getting 300 bar full fills. Due to the fact that most European shops have 300bar capable compressors the temptation for them is to give the 232bar user a hot 245bar fill so by the time it cools it is a respectable 230ish and they pick it up and are happy but as the compressor maxes out at 300 I don't get a hot 320 and I need to push for a top off."

scuba,3bsgsj,jermlai,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:58:54 2015 UTC,The transmitter you're using. How is it? I just got a d6i and wondering if its worth investing in one. I'm paranoid that it fails.
scuba,3bsgsj,KennyS1134,2,Thu Jul 2 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"I have a Suunto Novo D4i, with the same transmitter.  I LOVE IT!  It is extremely accurate, and I've never had any problems with it on a dive.  However, I would practice the coupling procedure at your local dive shop, or with your own tank (if you have one), to make sure you know how.  I had a little mishap trying to figure the damn thing out on a Cozumel dive boat, due to getting it a day before a dive trip.  I think having a standard gauge is still a very good idea."
scuba,3bsgsj,jermlai,2,Thu Jul 2 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"I love it. It makes it easier to check pressure without having to get my gauge and temporarily loose trim or streamlinedness (is that a word even?), and it tells me throughout the dive how much time I'd have left at that depth, making it a lot easier to get more out of your tank.  It's a little pricey for such a small piece of equipment, but definitely a nice gadget. I do carry a manual gauge as backup, and since it's often simpler to just check the manual gauge when your computer is not paired yet. Also makes sense to compare manual and wireless gauges to see if you didn't pair accidentally with your neighbor's tank. Also, what /u/KennyS1134 says."
scuba,3bsgsj,Fergoose,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:47:17 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks both of u! My only thought was for more streamlined profile. Guess I'll stick with my old school trusty SPG for now.
scuba,3bsgsj,travisd1000,2,Thu Jul 2 08:51:20 2015 UTC,"Please don't ever replace the SPG with the transmitter, use both. If your transmitter fails you need a back up with you on a dive, not on the boat or on land."
scuba,3bsgsj,Fergoose,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"How do you know which one is right then?  Dive with the one you trust/like better. If it fails, you thumb the dive and switch to your backup back on the boat."

I don't suggest using both to get a more correct read, the transmitter will be very accurate, however if it flat out fails to match at depth or a problem happens with your computer when you are diving, it's good to know you can simply check your SPG to be sure. If you don't have one you lose that ability, and to me that is a frightening thought."
scuba,3bsgsj,jonny_boy27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:46:22 2015 UTC,If they don't agree within 50psi/3bar they both get a trip to the shop for some testing and calibration.   In the event that they show wildly different numbers that are both tracking down during a dive I trust the lowest reading and if need be abort the dive.   I have been on several dives where my buddies wrist mounted computer has lost sync with the transmitter and he swam around with his hand behind his head for a couple minutes to get it to reconnect.  If he didn't have a mechanical SPG on his rig that would have been the end of our dives
scuba,3bsgsj,Anthrax15,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a bit less streamlined on the first stage, but not having to get out my manual SPG every time I want to check tank pressure makes well up for that."

scuba,3bsgsj,diverlad,0,Thu Jul 2 09:35:51 2015 UTC,I'm fairly new to diving and still learning the lingo. Can you explain what's going on in this pic?
scuba,3bsgsj,macado,7,Wed Jul 1 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"His tank has ~4500 PSI of air in it- well above what most tanks (though not that one I hope) are rated for, and well above what a lot of compressors will fill to."
scuba,3bsgsj,Kadugan,16,Wed Jul 1 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly.  This is a 12l steel tank rated for 300bar (4350 psi). It has a higher capacity than most common tanks, at the ""cost"" of weighing a bit more, both full (~22kg) and empty (probably 3k less), since there's about 40% more air in it. The extra capacity means longer dives, larger safety margins and possibly less need to refill in between shorter/shallower dives. The extra weight of the tank itself is easily compensated by carrying less weights.  In the Netherlands, where I live,  just fine to carry a tank like this around, and my local dive shops have compressors that can fill up to 300bar. In the U.S., this is fairly uncommon as the department of transportation forbids carrying a tank with more than 200bar, so no one bothers getting one, and no dive shop bothers getting a compressor that can actually fill such a tank up to 300bar. To use this tank, the regulator stages and gauges have to also support the higher pressure."
scuba,3bsgsj,macado,7,Wed Jul 1 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"I dive 300bar 12s as well, great tank. Means that I can get a couple of dives on a tank usually."
scuba,3bsgsj,stds9tng,3,Wed Jul 1 22:24:15 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly correct. While 300 bar/4350psi tanks are pretty uncommon here, most HP tanks in the USA are filled to 3500psi (~240bar).        A lot of banks in the USA are kept at 4000psi (275bar) or 4500psi (310bar).  Most shop compressors around here can at least fill to ~4000psi.  I routinely fill my own tanks to this pressure."
scuba,3bsgsj,stds9tng,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:28:14 2015 UTC,If you fill your 3442 tank to 4000 routinely you will probably fail your next hydro.

In this case, most of my fills to 4000psi usually cool down to ~3700-3800psi.  I've had some of these tanks for over 15 years (on their third hydro since I've owned them) and their original hydro dates are early 90s. They will probably outlive me."
scuba,3bsgsj,diverlad,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:55:04 2015 UTC,"Unless you are exceeding the ""endurance limit""- you can stress steel as often as you want and not cause it to fatigue.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_limit#/media/File:S-N_curves.PNG  Just so you know- Florida cave divers routinely fill low pressure tanks (2640 PSI) to 3800 or even 4000 PSI and have been doing so for a couple of decades already."
scuba,3bsgsj,jonny_boy27,4,Sat Jul 4 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"The extra capacity means longer dives, larger safety margins and possibly less need to refill in between shorter/shallower dives. The extra weight of the tank itself is easily compensated by carrying less weights.   Larger safety margins in terms of air capacity- but it's definitely harder on the regs. If you want more reliability from your regs- then lower pressure would be better. If you want a larger air reserve- then yes- this will give that to you.  That said- I don't entirely understand the purpose of all that air. I can't get near using up an AL80 on a no decompression dive- even down to 130'. I'd also rather lug two smaller tanks down to the water than one large one simply because it's easier on my back.  If that's for decompression dives- then I'd rather have doubles for the redundancy."
scuba,3bsgsj,stds9tng,2,Thu Jul 2 04:49:19 2015 UTC,I've got twin 300bar 12s on my back because a) the extra gas means my bottom time is effectively limited by my tolerance for deco (carrying 2x ally 80 stages) rather than limit of supply b) I can easily do two rhib dives to reasonable depth in a day without needing to go get a fill or swap cylinders (tricky where space is limited)

In fought water, when tired or stressed or both, re-attaching a snorkel to your mask strap would likely be a pain, unless you've practiced it.  I don't find the snorkel on the mask strap to be a big impediment, tho I agree it looks a lot cleaner to not have it there.  As a long-time coastal diver, tho, sometimes a long surface swim, perhaps against current, can be both necessary and unexpected. And a snorkel helps."
scuba,3bs4ry,CactusPete,9,Wed Jul 1 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, I never have an issue with it being on the strap. If I'm the first one in and visibility is decent I put my snorkel in and get my head under to check out where we're diving. It conserves air and I have been doing it like that for 20 years."
scuba,3bs4ry,Just1morefix,26,Wed Jul 1 19:18:46 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the point. If I'm on the surface I can inflate my wing and breath, if the water is so rough I can't keep my head up, I just put my reg in and start my decent. I just can't see its use for SCUBA.   I showed up to a tech class one time with two snorkels on my mask. You know- for redundancy :)"
scuba,3bs4ry,stds9tng,7,Wed Jul 1 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"i carry one in a pocket, useful sometimes for swimming over kelp on a shore dive. never had to use it for boat dives."
scuba,3bs4ry,runsongas,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:41:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, when I did my DM I carried mine in a pocket because I had to have it. And that seems like a good use :)"
scuba,3bs4ry,ItsTheTraveler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:10 2015 UTC,That's what i would recommend. 95% of time a mask gets knocked off it's because a snorkel catching something. Pocket snorkel all the way.
scuba,3bs4ry,PostPostModernism,7,Thu Jul 2 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's recommended to use it.  It can be useful at the surface.  It conserves air in your tank at the start of a dive if you're doing any surface swimming (whether boat or shore).  And at the end of a dive, if you are out of air or have malfunctioning regulator equipment, it can make a surface swim a lot easier.  Lastly, it's another good piece of equipment that will make you better able to assist other divers in an emergency.    You could certainly get away without it, but it's more one of those ""be prepared"" kind of things that comes in handy semi-regularly.  I was always taught to avoid using my regulator at the surface, though I won't claim to be the most disciplined about it.  I learned and worked at a place that teaches hundreds of kids a year, so we were pretty thorough on anything that could help prevent or deal with an accident."
scuba,3bs4ry,Badekar,3,Wed Jul 1 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"There are a million things that ""could be"" useful. Snorkel, radio, flare, emergency rations, a gun, shark repellent, duct tape... What you bring on any one dive is situational."
scuba,3bs4ry,dfsw,3,Wed Jul 1 19:47:39 2015 UTC,You all don't always dive with emergency rations?
scuba,3bs4ry,nigelh,3,Wed Jul 1 22:24:20 2015 UTC,A snorkel is a vital piece of equipment if you want to recharge your batteries using your diesel engines but you don't think that surfacing is good for the life expectancy of the crew of your submarine.  If I have to surface swim my scuba rig I do it on my back because I get a bigger better kick. This makes the average snorkel a bit silly.
scuba,3bs4ry,yogfthagen,2,Thu Jul 2 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"Depends how long of a surface swim you have.  Give it a hundred yards, no problem.  Start talking a half mile, that snorkel comes in awfully handy."
scuba,3bs4ry,McFeely_Smackup,3,Thu Jul 2 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"No, it's just one more thing to snag, tangle, or get confused.    If I were doing a dive that I knew had a long surface swim, then I'd bring one along, but I think it has more negatives than positives for the average dive."
scuba,3bs4ry,Autorotator,2,Wed Jul 1 19:39:52 2015 UTC,That annoyance when you think you have the inflator hose in your hand (it's corrugated and about the same diameter) only to find the mouthpiece and discover you were grabbing the snorkel elbow.  >:(

scuba,3bs4ry,-hh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"Same here....and the only diver that I've ever had to rescue needed to be rescued in part because they were ""too macho"" to be bothered by carrying a snorkel... without it, they couldn't keep their head above water to breathe and fatigued out.  The surface conditions changed while we were on the dive and became a short, rough & breaking chop at our drift pickup point...wouldn't have been too much of an issue if it had only been five minutes, but the chase boat had lost us, so it ended up being around a 30 minute float.     All in the supposedly always benign Caribbean.  -hh"

scuba,3bs4ry,KingNeptuna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:18 2015 UTC,i keep one in my BC pocket.  It can be useful if shore diving and a long swim back or the same back to a boat.  Regardless of how much air i have left i think it is easier to breath from a snorkel on the surface than from a reg
scuba,3bs4ry,B0bbySmile,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:41:10 2015 UTC,"I never carry one on my mask, however I carry a fold-able one in my dry-suit pocket, just in case.   I have never had reason to use one on the surface. And underwater they just seem to get in the way.  If i'm ever so desperate to need to conserve 1 or 2 bar of  pressure then the dive is not safely planed, or it's at the end of a dive and something has gone very wrong."
scuba,3bs4ry,ejs6591,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:10:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like its only good for long surface swims if at all. I only use it when I have a long swim back to shore and still want to pretend like I am underwater ;)
scuba,3bs4ry,bobbfwed,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"I usually have one on my mask unless I'm kelp diving or in a cavern or cave. I have used it on occasion for long surface swims for one reason or another, though I never felt it was necessary, just more comfortable/convenient than just inflating my BCD and keeping my head above water.  In kelp it can get tangled, just not worth the potential issues. And of course, cavern or cave, there's no way to surface where I would need it, and it's one more thing to hit the cave wall and cause issues, and it can get cause in a worst case scenario."
scuba,3bs4ry,Autorotator,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"When I'm diving from a RIB or other boat yes.  If we are doing a surface meetup (positive entry) or I'm anchor for the line that's a lot of time on the surface bobbing in what is sometimes some choppy water.  I don't like breathing too much of my tank on the surface, so I use the snorkel.  I also use one on the RIB when tying off to the mooring line, it's easier in a swell to jump off first, tie off the bow line, then let the pilot position the boat, then dump the rest of the dive party.  From the shore:  never. In glassy conditions:  never.  There is a place for it.  It's also useful if you have to do a surface swim."
scuba,3bs4ry,Autorotator,2,Wed Jul 1 21:27:43 2015 UTC,I can get behind that with a positive entry I guess. But why not just do a negative entry and meet up in water or at the bottom/dive site?
scuba,3bs4ry,lackin,2,Wed Jul 1 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"Experience/comfort of the other divers.  I prefer negative all the way, but sometimes people don't want to do it so I won't push the issue."

scuba,3bs4ry,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"So it looks like it's mostly useful for a long surface swim. So I guess I'd use one if that was the case.   But there are a few things that I wanted to pick up on in replies (and some people have already noted these):  If you need to conserve that few bar of air at the start of your dive, or have that little left at the end surely something is either wrong with your dive plan, or something went very wrong.  Also, why would you do a long surface swim face down? Maybe this is just me (and I'm weird) but I find it far more comfortable to inflate my wing and lie on my back. I right myself to check where I'm headed or my compass, then lie back and chill."
scuba,3bs4ry,runsongas,2,Wed Jul 1 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"If you need to conserve that few bar of air at the start of your dive, or have that little left at the end surely something is either wrong with your dive plan, or something went very wrong.   A lot of my diving is with less experienced people who take forever to get ready on the boat and I get seasick. Since I don't need to be on the boat to help (I'm not a DM, it's just a club thing) and I feel better on the surface than in the boat, I tend to just kit up and jump in to get out of the way. I've spent 10 or 15min on the surface just waiting... That's why I have a snorkel - so I can watch the pretty fishes while I wait for the slow people to get ready."
scuba,3bs4ry,runsongas,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:17:38 2015 UTC,Good reason.
scuba,3bs4ry,alaskanpolyglot,2,Wed Jul 1 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I stopped carrying one after my 20th dive. Now, 150 dives later, I can say that was mostly the right decision but there were also a number of cases where I dearly wished I had it strapped to my mask.  Those were, similar to what lackin said, when I had to wait for other divers in a high swell or strong current. Sure, I could have used my reg. But a reg at the surface for 10 minutes, that also consumes a non-trivial amount of air. Especially when you dive with a club where people stay down for as long as they have enough air.   Another case that comes to mind is that sometimes an opportunity for a good snorkel comes up. E.g., where I dive you can encounter humpbacks or minke whales in winter. You come up from a dive, there are the whales. So what do you do? Dump your gear and jump straight back in, snorkelling."

There is one in particular where a DM swam left a group of divers linked together and swam several miles to shore to get help ... and thanks to his snorkel all the divers survived and were picked of after 24 hours in the water (I think that was the time frame though I can't find the article right now)"

The land-based diving was great; being able to relax on solid ground was awesome (my dive buddy can get rather seasick...). We saw everything there was to see, but we were diving 6 days straight and got really lucky.   One of the attractions in liveaboards is going WAY out there to Darwin Island to look for whale sharks. That's where the tracking chips say they hang out sometimes, but a group went there and didn't see any, while at the same time, we went to a land-based place and saw one (a baby, but still).  There's tons to see, and most of the big stuff one can see at Gordon Rocks, as there are lots of currents going through there (it's like a 99% possibility to see hammerhead sharks there, which, coincidentally, is what a lot of people go there for)."

This is a business, of course I'd like for DIVR to be profitable, but I don't expect that the market is big enough to be the next huge app. I'm a diver and I wanted an easy way to find people to go diving with and thought this was a cool idea. I can't have my company bleed money on server fees, so there's ads and in app purchases. Simple as that.   I will be advising people to stay away from this.

scuba,3bo4zm,eanx100,2,Tue Jun 30 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"So, I applaud the effort, but the reality here is that you're essentially building a limited social network. I don't think many people are willing to pay for a social network, especially as there are already several available tailored to this purpose. I don't think you want any barriers to entry either, as a vibrant and large community will be your single biggest selling point.  I think you would be better off supporting this with ads (which are extremely easy to tailor and make effective on such a specific platform) and potentially add a pay tier, either mandatory for some features (removal of ads, preferential display in searches) or donation, to support the more complex and difficult to implement and maintain features. Offering lifetime premium subscriptions can win you pretty sizable chunks of cash and loyal users in early years. Be completely transparent about your need to work with the community to survive and make the site better for everyone.  Just because this is what any venture capital firm is going to ask if you seek funding at some point: Sell me on why I should pay to use your app when there are free alternatives."

The app has two monetization methods, you can buy a subscription to unlock everything (which is what I'm offering for free here). Or you can buy tokens and just purchase the features you care about.  For what it's worth I built this app as a personal project and a launching point to build tech for my company.

Initial issues I noticed on a Nexus 5 with Android 5.1 pretty close to stock:  -One picture I tried to upload displayed as a single pixel in the cropping activity. Another did not. -App minimizes virtual back, home, and app tray buttons on a nexus 5. Hard and non-intuitive to re-expand it as the space is taken over by an ad. -Poor validation prompts on registering. If an invalid email is entered (e.g. no @ or .com) the prompt displays something like ""You must enter both a username and password"" rather than specifically calling out username format. Every validation you do should have a unique piece of prose feedback. -Weird text entry stuff with stock android 5.1 keyboard. Could not enter numbers into promo code field. Some fields pop up an additional text box rather than entering text directly into the one clicked. -Adding pictures is clunky. When clicking on the last picture in the shared images activity a blank photo is added if the back button is clicked without adding a photo. Can't figure out how to remove these blank stubs. -Uploading images sometimes overwrites existing images with duplicates. Only seen so far when the previous issue is present -Photos can reach a state with multiple primary photos."

scuba,3bq7fc,TaylordPerspective,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"Hiya!  I've done one of their internships!  Lemme answer your questions one by one  1) Yup I have.  2) In most of the places you stay nearby in a 'meh' accomodations.  Think backpacker.  My place in Playa was a cheap place with thatched roofs that leaked when it rained.  Places like Jamaica you stay on site because it's entirely too unsafe not to.  3) My day was waking up at 6am, to walk 30 minutes to where the van would pick us up.  From there they'd drive us another half hour to the resort.  We'd eat what amounted to day old buffet food, or low quality mass produced rice primarily.  We'd have to walk the 1.5 miles to the shore, get some dives in, then you'd be trying to sell scuba diving to resort goers all day.  In my experience, they hung the sword of damocles over your head if you were 'underperforming' in their eyes, however, would never give me a specific goal number.  You'd have to take that 1.5 mile walk back to the mess for lunch, and again back to the shop.  All in all you were easily hiking 10 miles a day around the resort in tropical heat, trying to sell scuba diving to people who were, justifiably, skeptical of a resort dive course.  4) Depends on where you go.  Mexico was 6 months you can stay before you have to spend one night in another country then you can stay another 6 months.  5) LOL no, absolutely not.  6) No you don't get any boat experience at all.  Happy to answer any questions.  My experience can be summed up in the following way.  It was great to see how the resort industry functions.  They cut some serious corners (having open water divers lead/ teach students in the pool with no waivers or medical forms signed).  And the feeling was that they were happy to discard me if they saw an advantage in it.  The conditions were just a step above camping, the food was problematic for my body, and the amenities you're given access to are not a thing.  That's the short version of it.  Heck, part of me just suggests saving up and having the money to do it out of pocket, and then giving it a go.  Worst case, you're already in the location you wanted to operate with, and no biggie if another operator is nearby.    I did that in Playa / Cozumel, left their program and paid for my Divemaster, which was a WAY better decision."

scuba,3bpgdb,typhereon,3,Wed Jul 1 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"when you say lower arm, do you mean a wrist/cuff dump? you can try it out, but wrist dumps usually involve a bit more maneuvering than shoulder dumps.  at the end of the day, having the dump somewhere on the left arm pretty much ends up working the same. different people just find it easier to reach or use a dump on different parts of the arm.  you really shouldn't need dumps at your ankles. just practice with your drysuit to stay in trim and minimize your bubble. inflate for squeeze not buoyancy."
scuba,3bpgdb,runsongas,3,Wed Jul 1 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"OK my take is that the dump wants to be on the arm and all forward of the centre line. Rather like this. Being a rebreather diver how I breathe makes no difference to my buoyancy so everything has to be deliberate to stay neutral and as I'm very picky I know this one works. I dive with it wide open and only close it when I hit the surface and then only because the waves massage out the air and you get shrink wrapped.  Dump valves on the ankles? Beginner solution to a non-problem. You will regret it. What is the problem with drysuit dumps? Being over weighted. You expect to be able to sink when you first jump in and you don't so you pile on the lead. Epic fail. To descend with a dry suit go upright and wiggle. All the spare air in your legs gets up past your weight belt and rises towards the dump (which is wide open) and dumps. Your cylinder contains 3Kgms of gas so dump your BCD, exhale and you drop. Add gas to the suit when it squeezes. If you want more buoyancy than that put it in the BCD. If you want to dump some buoyancy take hold of the BCD hose and elevate it just as you did before you had the drysuit but don't press the button yet. The drysuit dump is now pulled up to the top and dumps a bit, if it's not enough push the dump on the BCD.  The other thing to do is to learn to preempt things. I'm drifting up the side of a wreck and the top is coming up so start to dump. You slow down and stop. Looks so cool but it only takes a couple of goes to learn it. It's even easier for you bubble blowers because you can take/dump a big lungful to help."
scuba,3bpgdb,nigelh,2,Wed Jul 1 10:30:52 2015 UTC,"If the existing placement doesn't work for you, try the new spot. Can't hurt.   Valves in the feet sound kind of cool, but it's 2 more parts to maintain... And have you ever NEEDED them? If your feet get floaty, some of those rubber fin keepers on your suit feet will really reduce the amount of air that can even get in there. (Apollo suit?)"
scuba,3bpgdb,StargateCommand,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"I'm personally not a fan of wrist dumps, I find them to be uncomfortable. I like the dump valve just on the outside of my arm, below the shoulder slightly. Right about where most folks would get the standard upper arm tattoo."

scuba,3bpgdb,ElGuano,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"I had this same problem, along with one of my buddies, and we have front-zip drysuits. IMO, if you're diving in ""proper trim"" (horizontal), this ""valve on bicep"" position is the worst place it could be. It traps air and makes it so you cannot vent unless you go upright and do a massive chicken-wing manuever with your arm.  We both had our LDS relocate the exhaust valve to be closer to the midline, or even towards the back, and it's made a world of difference in ease of venting and general buoyancy control. I have some pics of the move and patch, I'll ul a pic in a min.   EDIT: Here's a pic of the dump valve move: http://i.imgur.com/nymWqQ0.jpg  You can see the patch where the original position was. When I was wearing the suit, the valve was pointed forward and down. Now it's just slightly above the midline of my arm."
scuba,3bpgdb,LackTheWitForFunnySN,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"I have a wrist dump, and I find it rather problematic. I am very hesitant to mount anything on that arm (computer/compass/etc.) behind the dump valve as that would hinder air reaching the valve when I really need to dump (i.e. on ascent). If you can work out a spot on the shoulder, that's really the best option. Mount everything where you like, simply roll to one side to dump, and less chance of damage to the valve as it is out of the way. Maybe the outer bicep would be a good in between since the zipper is in the way."

scuba,3bpgdb,stds9tng,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"The ScubaPro EverDry 4 drysuit has an identical back entry and dump valve location. Is it as simple to use as a side location? Not quite- but at the same time it shouldn't be causing you that much trouble. Roll a hair more to the side or lift your arm a little higher and it should still vent just fine. The bigger problem is definitely the valve sticking shut. That's incredibly dangerous and a recipe for disaster.  I would fix the valve first before adding crap anywhere else. If you add a dump on your wrist you've just made it harder to dump (now you need to raise your whole arm and not just your shoulder) and you've taken up valuable forearm real estate (which could be used for a slate or a backup computer) for a valve that doesn't belong there.  As for foot dumps ... WTF? You're adding two more failure points in a spot that can be very difficult to reach easily when wearing a drysuit- and for what? Proper bubble management is the key to diving a drysuit. Too much air got into the feet? Drop them for a second and get it out. If you are in a proper position when technical diving your feet are going to be the high point and you're either going to be dumping air a lot, or you're going to need to keep the valve closed. Either way- it doesn't solve your problem and introduces others.  Besides which- unless you let the bubble get away from you- most people end up with too little air in their feet (because they swim foot low) rather than too much. All that gets you is a foot squeeze. If you keep just enough air in the suit to prevent a squeeze- then with your feet up there will be a little more air in them and you'll be a lot more comfortable."
scuba,3bpgdb,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:48:44 2015 UTC,"I should probably have pointed out in the OP that I'm not considering trying the ankle dumps. My trim is good as is and I don't need them.

scuba,3bpgdb,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:48:47 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of the dump valve on the EverDry 4. It's too far on the 'inside' of my arm and despite leaving it completely open it takes some vigorous manipulation to vent. I often need to come out of trim. As a result I put little air in the suit and have had squeeze marks on more than one occasion because it's just not reliable.  One theory could be clogging due to undergarments so I've canned the fleece and will try out a lavacore instead.   Others have had a totally different experience and its ordinarily a great suit but after 40 or so dives in it I'm still not comfortable in it.

scuba,3bnjyt,ejs6591,6,Tue Jun 30 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"I night dive quite often, during summer months usually twice a night if I can find takers.  It's my favorite time to dive, along with very early morning dives when the sun is rising.  Remember to dive the site during light to be familiar with it.  Don't go with others who are familiar if you are not.  It's not okay for some of the group to know where they are but you just tag along.  It's a potentially deadly link in a disaster chain.  It is VERY easy for a group to lose a person at night.  As others said, keep the lights down.  Super bright torches just scare fish and blind divers.  Along the lines of the first tip:  Don't take any new gear or new gear configurations on a night dive.  Have at least one dive during light hours with the configuration you will dive at night.  I'm a little religious about that one, and my last daylight dive will be with the torch I'll take, my thigh pocket with my night kit, and all my little gadgets/camera/whatever configured how I will take it back in in the dark.  No weight changes or anything drastic like that at all.  Do an out of air drill before the night dive too.  You do NOT want to find something inaccessible in the dark that could have been worked out in the day.  A reg hose that snags in the day is a minor inconvenience, but a HP hose leak at night (nobody's going to notice it) that drains a tank is dangerous enough, you don't want to learn someone's spare doesn't function well when it's dark."

We're all told it in courses, but then there's this really simple site and there's no time to do it during the day first and you figure it'll be ok... and everyone else is ok with it...   I've had three uncomfortable experiences with night dives primarily because I wasn't familiar with the sites. I only agreed to do those dives because they were extremely shallow (less than 5m) and shore dives where we would move along the shore (not really going to get lost), so it was fine to just ascend when things got worrying, but now I've been really put off doing a ""proper"" night dive because the ""easy"" ones were so stressful. And all because I didn't follow this simple logical advice :/"
scuba,3bnjyt,lackin,2,Wed Jul 1 11:41:24 2015 UTC,"I've been disoriented on a house reef I dive about 40 times a year.  Just fooled by the moon (mistook it for the shore light @16M) and in between two fingers on the 40M tall coral wall.  Did a safety stop at the wrong buoy line, swam up the ""canyon"" and found coral wall instead of the beach.  Did an uncomfortable 10 minute swim at 5M down to the beach with my 7 buddies in tow.  We surfaced, to the man/woman we all thought we were at the right buoy.  Some of them have years at that reef.  Even with proper orientation, shit happens at night.  My worst experience was taking a real good dude out for his second night dive.  Turns out he always just follows people, never pays attention to where he's going.  Doesn't have a comp.  None of which I knew getting in the water.  10 mins into the dive that is supposed to be 30 minutes at 14 M max, I look down from 12 M and see him down at a landmark I know is 26 M.  His trim was vertical and he swears he was following me.  I went down, brought him to depth, pointed to his gauge and signaled 14.  He gives me the okay, I let go of his inflator and first stage, he's neutrally buoyant.  2 mins later and I'm pulling him up again from 28.  Ended the dive 15 minutes in.  That was when I became the jerk who checks everyone else's gear too.

Can also hold gopros with a little creativity. Some lights have enough of a magnetic field to throw a compass off. Test yours and keep it away from the compass if necessary.
scuba,3bnjyt,notjhh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"Night dives are fun, but bring a spare light.  Cyalumes make great tank lights and if planned properly, each buddy pair can have matching lights that are also different colors from the rest of the dives.  Depending on what and where you are diving, it is nice to put a strobe on the bottom of the down line. Makes for an easy exit when the time comes."
scuba,3bnjyt,CanadianDiver,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"Newish night divers tend to want to follow a group with a DM around. I recommend strongly against that. Nightdiving is a very personal experience and having to stick with a group of 5 or 6 people is really stressful at night. People will bump into each other, blind each other with their lights, and you won't get to see much because you're constantly worried about following the group around.  Instead, dive with your buddy, go really slow, don't go far from the anchor/mooring — an activity radius of 30 meters around your point of descent shoudl be enough unless the goal is to first swim to some nearby point of interest.  Don't worry about getting lost / not finding back to the boat: you shouldn't go very far, and they will usually have a strong light on the backdeck that you should be able to spot from anywhere down below.  Just make sure that you don't conflate the moon for that light, I know people who did that and they followed the moon around, ending up quite far from the boat :D  Oh, and finally: I find it very helpful and reassuring to attach a chem light or small spare torch to the anchor chain or mooring, or wherever else you have your descent. Normally a dive operator will do that automatically, but you should consider bringing a spare chem light for the purpose if they don't."

scuba,3bnjyt,nigelh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:05:17 2015 UTC,"Try to set up your gear before it's dark.  Don't shine people in the face with your light.  Turn on your light before you enter the water.  If you switch to a backup light, turn it on before you unclip it.   If you drop it, it is much easier to find a light that is on."
scuba,3bnjyt,eanx100,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:06:43 2015 UTC,Keep your light on low and don't be afraid to cover it entirely. Keep an eye out for bio-luminescent worms and algae in the water. Keep to the periphery of the group where you have fewer people trying to blind you with lights. At the same time- make sure you keep them in sight or know for certain where the boat is.  Mostly- just try to relax and enjoy it!
scuba,3bmhij,Hukamaru,3,Tue Jun 30 12:23:21 2015 UTC,There is a very long scubaboard thread about this guy. I think the verdict was that SSI won't do a thing because he brings in too much money with his rebreather+drysuit sales to brand new divers. Haven't met him but looks/sounds like a class act.
scuba,3bmhij,jensfisc,3,Tue Jun 30 13:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that thread is still on-going. Basically he is a slimy salesman who does anything to make a sale. Read the Yelp reviews too. All the legitimate reviews are terrible.    He tells people that if they buy his gear through him, he will do their certification courses for free, but then sells them $5000+ gear. He often sells unnecessary gear, like drysuits to people diving in So. California. He sells new open water divers rebreathers and other advanced and technical gear, often without the proper training.  He claims a 30-day money back guarantee or return policy, but if you try to use it, he claims he never said that.  He posts videos like the OP's link on his website. This particular one was on his website for a while, until it got reported. He removed it, but still has other terrible videos on his site. If you watch the videos, you can tell his divers aren't trained properly. They are swimming with their arms, hoses and SPGs dangling, etc.    The guy is a horrible person who should have his business license taken away, and his certification license taken too."

I've practiced with it snorkeling and it doesn't cause any problems with mask fit or shifting. Would you still say to leave it behind?
scuba,3bokzc,nigelh,0,Wed Jul 1 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"Imho even if you don't have to handle the camera you still will have the camera in mind while diving. This will distract you from diving. Leave it on shore for the first 10 dives and if you feel more confident about your trim and buoyancy, try to use it then. If you really want some dive footage, hand the camera to your guide, then you will even have footage of yourself underwater which can help identifying trim/buoyancy problems."

scuba,3bn1r4,runsongas,2,Tue Jun 30 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"Congrats on taking the plunge and deciding to get certified! Pardon the pun ;)  I definitely think as far as gear is concerned you're much better off renting, at least until you get a bit more experience.  If this is anything to go by, I only decided to start purchasing my own gear after taking on the Divemaster trainee program, because by that time I knew what I liked and what I didn't...   The one piece of equipment I'd recommend investing in however is a decent mask that fits properly- there's nothing worse than grabbing an ill fitting shop mask that continually leaks and ruins the dice you're on.  Enjoy the OW course and happy diving!"
scuba,3bn1r4,reddit0rial,2,Tue Jun 30 19:48:26 2015 UTC,Don't buy stuff to start with. Hire until you know what suits you. If you take advice from me you will get kit that suits me and you're not me.  Concentrate of doing the drills right and having fun. What you are doing on the basic courses are setting up a mental tool kit so if something goes wrong later you end up back ashore wondering what it will cost to fix what ever it was that broke or dropped off.

scuba,3bnues,Stalin420,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"PADI does have a course for this that goes over the whole thing, but as /u/stds9tng has stated already, basically as atmosphere at surface is lower at 4000 feet than at sea level, the required depth to double the surface pressure is less (hence why we treat 30' as being 35' for 4000').  If you dive with a computer it may have a setting to adjust for altitude. For example, the Suunto Zoop (Gekko) has A0, A1 and A2 settings, the legend for which is printed on the back as well as the manual."
scuba,3bnues,Aienan,2,Tue Jun 30 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"if you are using your dive computer, most will adjust for the depth measurement and NDL limits automatically.  if you want to run it in gauge mode, then you will need altitude tables or convert your measured depth to sea level as pointed out by stds."
scuba,3bnues,runsongas,3,Tue Jun 30 20:50:02 2015 UTC,There are procedures to deal with this. You need a set of dive tables and an altitude conversion table. Something like this:  https://itsallaboutscuba.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/theoretical.gif  30 feet at an altitude of 4k feet would be equivalent to dive a 35 feet which is the shallowest depth on a normal dive planning table anyway.  A dive to 60 feet would be treated as if it were to 69 feet.

When one of the two DMs pointed out the eel and swam away from the reef, my wife and I stuck around to film/observe.  First the eel turned and swam towards my wife.  She 'bashed' (her word, but really it was a nudge) it with the camera rig, which is when the eel goes out of frame.  The eel then swam at me.  I had the elf (for Lionfish hunting) but did not want to hurt the eel, nor did I want to further provoke it.  I smacked it with my fin and swam away.

scuba,3bkljh,oriah,3,Tue Jun 30 01:55:56 2015 UTC,There's two ways to do Timelapse.   1) Using the time lapse option in the gopro where it takes photos sequentially and you import the photos as an image sequence in Windows(not sure how it's done on a Mac). Here's a video explaining how https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LcN0nT8aU  2) The other option is to shoot in 4k Video at 15 frames then speed up the video in post. 3000-9999% + Speed.  Few tips for stabilizing.  1) Shooting in 60frames and edit it in half speed.  2) Adobe Premiere has a Warp Stabilizer effect you can add to clips. Works well on shots that aren't too shaky.   3) On some of the shots out of water I used a hand held stabilizer like this one. Worked great on the bike riding shots. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NNHGDFI/ref=pe_62860_137442620_em_1p_0_ti

scuba,3bkljh,rainman_104,2,Tue Jun 30 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"The red filter is mainly for the under water shots. Once you get a few meters under water, red light doesn't penetrate water very well so adding a red filter on the lens brings the Red/Green/Blue color balance back into the shot.   The macro lens is essentially a magnifying glass. When you shoot really really close to objects the GoPro doesn't focus very well. The macro lens keeps it in focus."

I'm with /u/CanadianDiver on this one. I'll take Apeks over Oceanic any day of the week. You won't find many technical divers using anything but Apeks (or HOG which is an Apeks clone), ScubaPro, and the occasional Poseidon. Technical divers need rock solid, high performance regulators- and Apeks fits the bill. (Aqualung owns Apeks and uses their designs. The Legend is basically an XTX-200).  The XTX50 is one of the best regulators made (and less expensive than the Zeo). I currently own 7 and can't imagine ever switching to another reg."

Not gonna lie, the white version of the Zeo may have something to do with my curious interest in it...

scuba,3bie42,stds9tng,2,Mon Jun 29 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"don't think there were any outright failures, just some complaints about how it worked. it is based on a little ball that closes against the opening in the yoke/din connector. the DVT works off a pressure differential so it can actually open from being dunked deep enough. if you get enough corrosion or buildup, it can theoretically also close up on you when it should be open."
scuba,3bie42,stds9tng,0,Mon Jun 29 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Mouthpiece   The Apeks mouthpiece is incredibly comfortable and I say this as someone who has spent hours breathing on one while doing decompression.   double switch adjustment (1 venturi, 1 airflow)   Already on the XTX50.   swivel on 2nd stage   With a braided hose (standard on the Apeks) of the correct length- a swivel isn't necessary and just adds another point of failure. If you must have a swivel- they are trivial to add.   1rst stage that has an automatic seal in case I dont put the cap back in place or prevents sand to get into it in between tank dive switch.   Totally unnecessary and has it's own problems. You can damage the automatic seal if you pull of the reg with even a little bit of pressure still in the lines (or at least that used to be a common problem with those systems).   Like that it comes with Maxflex hosing.   Apeks already comes with braided hoses.   I agree with Apeks being truly tested and highly reviewed. But the Zeo just seems to be a decent reg in general.   I have to confess- I really don't understand that line of thought. Apeks is the gold standard in regulators for a lot of divers but instead you're considering a regulator that ""seems to be a decent reg""?   Not gonna lie, the white version of the Zeo may have something to do with my curious interest in it...   A white reg is just going to be a dirty brown reg for most people after a few dives. Get some scratches on it, dive in murky water, and before you know it- that pretty white regulator is going to look pretty terrible.  Your first priority when it comes to a regulator should always be performance and reliability. How well does it breathe, and how well is it going to continue to breathe."

Bought red filter and macro lense for it as well, that was another 50$  If you wanted to go down the regular Hero, I would at least buy a bobber for it so if you ""lose it"", it will go to the surface.

You may have to pay full price for the phone if you are on a subsidized contract. A full price smartphone is as expensive if not more than a GoPro (or similar underwater camera).  If you lose an underwater camera, you are really limiting your losses to the photos on the device and the device itself. It is much easier to replace.

scuba,3benwd,hannylicious,2,Sun Jun 28 15:04:50 2015 UTC,"Great questions!  I'll try and give you a succinct answer cause one could go on for quite a while about these topics.    Ocean vs. lake  Oceans tend to have better visibility and a more interesting assortment of life.  Smaller lakes and quarries don't have waves or currents to fight with and are great for beginner training.    Gear differences Some people have lighter ""travel"" BCDs that they take on trips.  In reality these travel BCDs are often a good lightweight options for the average recreational diver.  However those who chose to dive in fresh water for fun are often the type of diver that doesn't let a little cold weather hold them back.  This means investing in a drysuit and a bcd big enough and with enough lift to deal with a drysuit. Tl;dr there is no difference for the average diver between fresh and salt water gear.    Getting certified If you enjoyed your DSD, then you already have the most important thing you need to become certified: a desire to learn.  Visit the shops around where you live and get a feel for whether you like the guys.  You will learn better from people you like, and hopefully scoping out the place will give you a feel for how much you might trust them.  Alternatively, you could do the classroom portion of your certification class online, then complete the diving portion in a couple days somewhere nice during your next vacation.  I would recommend the former option as many people prefer to stress over learning skills like mask removal, etc. while they are at home, and then simply go and enjoy their vacation with a little less stress.    Edit: gear quality The gear you used for your DSD has had a tough life being used and abused nearly every day since it hit the shelf.  It was also probably of a lesser quality than you would purchase for yourself.  Mask, fins, and snorkel are all about personal preference.  I've used a $40 model mask for years that I prefer over the atomic aquatics, aqualung, etc that I've recently tried.  Wetsuit matters mainly on fit and thickness.  Some may be durable/expensive than others.  The ""Waterproof"" brand and lava core seem pretty popular these days.  I use a Bare personally, but that's primarily because of fit.      BCDs differ mainly in respect to back inflate vs. jacket, pockets, LPI design, d-rings, and weight release design.  Again it mainly comes down to preference.  So how does a new diver know what they prefer?  Trying different rental gear can help.  Also asking people you dive with if/why they like a certain piece of gear is not only informative, but very easy conversation on a dive outing."
scuba,3benwd,Ernest_Retard_Ringo,2,Sun Jun 28 20:15:30 2015 UTC,Advice? Get out while you still can! Why are you here asking the crack heads about the advantages of Cocaine?  Look. Diving is expensive and addictive. There is all sorts of kit for warm and cold water and you're going to end up with both. There are basic qualifications but learn in cold murky water if you can because that gets taken seriously everywhere. Read equipment reviews and never take advice from somebody selling something. Rent kit until you know what you hate so you know what not to buy.  Why do we like to dive? I suspect it's because we all really want to fly. One of my happy moments is a stupid quarry dive where you move out over a shelf at about six meters and then it just drops off to 20 meters as a cliff. You just swim out over the cliff and helicopter down without touching anything. Yes I'm a wreck nerd and I love to be in a team investigating and unknown pile of scrap but I need my fix of helicopter.
scuba,3benwd,nigelh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Scuba gear is expensive. Even the cheap stuff is expensive when compared to other sports. So here's what I'd do; plan your purchases in stages.  You don't need to own a full set of gear right now. Focus on getting a mask that fits you well and will last. Maybe get a good wetsuit too, but not if it prevents you from getting the mask that you want.  Then later on, after you've been certified and you've done a few dives, get the next few bits of gear. That's probably fins and boots.  After that, I'd go for a dive computer. I bought my own computer sometime after my 20th dive.  Then, if you're still diving often, then get your BCD, regulators, and anything else.  By spreading those purchases out, you take a lot of the stress out of buying gear."
scuba,3benwd,MyFavouriteName,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:41:25 2015 UTC,Right on.  Just rent that gear on an 'as needed' basis until I get it all filled out then?

scuba,3benwd,runsongas,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"if you decide to take an open water class to get certified, it is common for shops to expect you to have your own personal gear (mask, snorkel, fins, and boots and gloves if needed)."

If the stuff is above you, dive shallower ;-)  Strobes only work real well inside a few meters anyway.  Even in relatively clear water you will get particulate scatter obscuring your picture once you back out.  Inside a few meters, you won't be able to frame a larger animal in the shot.  You have to rely on good positioning and luck to get a good picture of a large creature.  I still always recommend good lights for vids/pics, but be aware of what you will and won't be able to do with it."
scuba,3bcmr7,uzername10,5,Sat Jun 27 23:16:14 2015 UTC,Go diving with it :)  Seriously- just go diving. If it fogs up- scrub it some more. You can bring some toothpaste with you and just scrub it between dives if you have to.

scuba,3bcmr7,stds9tng,3,Sat Jun 27 23:39:58 2015 UTC,"Spit/NoMoreTears/whatever are to help prevent fogging- but the root cause is generally silicone and other contaminants on the lenses themselves. The only way to clear that off is to scrub it, and scrub it well."
scuba,3bcmr7,kroneksix,2,Sat Jun 27 23:42:28 2015 UTC,"The only way to clear that off is to scrub it, and scrub it well.   If you are very careful, a lighter/blowtorch works better and is much quicker than toothpaste. But if you fuck it up you melt your skirt!"
scuba,3bcmr7,awesterdam,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"Hold up. Are you telling me that if scrub that lens up enough, I can skip using ""Spit/NoMoreTears/whatever"" and it will not fog up AT ALL (even if I regularly breathe into mask)?  I've always assumed it's to reduce fogging, but i'm getting very very confused here!"
scuba,3bcmr7,Smellzlikefish,2,Sun Jun 28 01:01:00 2015 UTC,Scrubbing gets rid of the stuff that makes masks impossible to defog correctly.  We all know that person who bought a mask and just can never seem to get rid of all of the fog.  Those are people who need to scrub a bit more before the defogging agent (spit/no-tears) will work.
scuba,3bcmr7,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:07:18 2015 UTC,"Hold up. Are you telling me that if scrub that lens up enough, I can skip using ""Spit/NoMoreTears/whatever"" and it will not fog up AT ALL (even if I regularly breathe into mask)?   Entirely? No. But there are a lot of variables at play. The cleaner the mask- the fewer the places there are for condensation to form. That said- even on the cleanest mask- there are microscopic imperfections that will allow moisture to condense.  In warm water you may not need any defog in a properly scrubbed mask and it will stay clear. In cold water- even with a properly scrubbed mask you're going to get fogging without a defog solution. Defogging solutions help the situation- but on it's own it's generally not enough."
scuba,3bcmr7,runfish_run,3,Sun Jun 28 01:30:28 2015 UTC,Try exhaling into your mask to purposely fog it up. You can kinda see where the layer still needs scrubbed off.
scuba,3bcmr7,aussiekev,3,Sat Jun 27 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"This. Also condensation occurs when outside the mask is colder than inside the mask. The moisture in the warm air in the mask condenses against the glass as the temperature on the other side of the glass is cooler. Another way to test this is to boil water and pour it into a large bowl. Inhale some of the warm air/steam from the bowl and exhale slightly into the mask, then see how you go."
scuba,3bcmr7,phyde,2,Sun Jun 28 02:40:56 2015 UTC,I got taught that you scrub in and scrub it until you start to hear little squeaky noises. Worked for me so far on the few masks I've had over the years

If you plan on taking up diving- spend a little more and buy a good mask and fins suitable for diving.  Nose purges and dry snorkels are OK if you never plan on diving- but if you do plan on diving- they're just a nuisance.  As for the mask- the fit is the single most important concern.

scuba,3b8spi,bowshikabowow,4,Fri Jun 26 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"I've done one boat dive at San Diego which was Point Loma, but personally I prefer the Cove over it. As for a guide, it depends on your level of diving, comfort and familiarity in navigating. If you aren't comfortable check out power scuba or find a dive buddy on meetup.com, I believe they have many groups going out of the cove regularly or if you're a GUE diver there's always the SDGUE facebook page to organize an outing. If you're comfortable navigating and don't mind a far kick out go to buoy A (20 minute kick out) and drop down and make your way back slowly, or go to the northwest side of the cove. Both are good areas to spot some incredible sea life. That being said, I would never dive alone and especially in a new area. Get a buddy!    Check conditions and call the lifeguard tower the day before and the day of, and get there bright and early since the parking sucks there. By 8am the parking is filled up on a weekend."

If you're just starting AOW- you're a long way from worrying about becoming an instructor. You may not believe me now- but unless you absolutely love teaching- becoming an instructor is not all it's cracked up to be. Low pay, a lot of stress, and you don't get to enjoy the diving. Something like 80% of instructors stop teaching after the first couple of years.   What are some things to look for when researching live aboard ships? What are some benefits or disadvantages to this type of dive excursion vs beach/shore dive resorts? I have checked a couple places so far and found some for $2-300 per night which seems way too high.    Liveaboards can be a fantastic way to build up dives. You can do 5 to 6 dives a day and you don't need to lug your gear back and forth to a dive boat constantly.  Most liveaboards are meant to be a premium experience and so the price reflects that. On the other hand- you have no frills operations like Blackbeard's Cruises. They do bunk style sleeping quarters and the concentration is on the diving- not luxury. It's a very inexpensive way to rack up a lot of dives."

I remember as a 5 year old sitting in the back of our station wagon with a new garbage can filled with seawater and a giant octopus on our way to Alki Beach to ""walk the octopus"".  Dad took it out in Puget Sound and let it swim around for hours.  He carefully took the rejuvenated octopus back to the aquarium and it lived many long years.  Dad also built an underwater case for his super 8 movie camera and took the first underwater home movies of an octopus and her eggs."

When I was a kid, my dad worked for a petroleum company that had this awesome recreational facility with a massive pool that was about 4m deep at the deep end. They would train their divers in there sometimes. Before I saw the divers do it, I always thought it was impossible for a human to swim to the bottom. I thought they were so cool. They reminded me of astronauts. I'll never forget freediving to the bottom for the very first time and mimicking them practicing their mask clearing skills without really realizing what I was doing (I actually thought it was part of how to breath somehow and even convinced myself and my friends that I could stay underwater for much longer by doing that ha ha). Always wanted to do it, but thought it would cost too much and never really bothered to look into it, but a friend of mine started her OW and told me that our LDS had an offer going and I made an impulsive decision to do it and dragged some friends along too (I literally thought ""I want to do this"" and signed up 20 minutes later).   Now I can't stop doing it and I try to get as many people as I know into it aswell. I love being weightless, I love observing and monitoring the marine life, I love the thrill of the unknown whether it's exploring a new site or just wondering if you would spot certain things, and I love meeting other people that share my sentiments with as much enthusiasm as I do."

scuba,3b4vok,unknownsymbol,2,Fri Jun 26 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"Most places that take you diving will ask for a certificate anyway. In USA, usually, you cannot rent or fill a tank without showing a certificate.  The certificate is like US$300 and 2 weekends of your time. Not a huge commitment. Cert is good for lifetime.  Sure, you could shore-dive, buy your own compressor (US$3000)... But why, what are you running off to create such burden on yourself.  Learning to drive a car is way harder than pass basic scuba certificate class.  How are you going to derive what you should do as a scuba diver without know anything about the gear or skills?  Some people learn by making mistakes, others on mistakes done by others. In scuba most errors are deadly, unfortunately. Can you be sure not to make any of them without someone else telling you what they are?  I found that certification was pretty fun, we joked all the way.  Example: A scuba diver is 25 feet down, you have no scuba equipment on the surface, you dive down by holding breath. You approach the scuba diver and breath from his equipment and then head for the surface. All good right? If you hold breath with a same strength as you dove down, your lungs will burst, the air will get trapped in your chest. Why? <-------------- They tell you all in scuba class.   This is just one of those moments that seem safe but will injure you. How long can you swim with burst lungs? That is why most accidents are deadly, water finishes you off. Got to be smart. It is like letting a kid to play around open electric equipment. Not that this kid cannot become an electric engineer some time in the future, but without certain knowledge you can touch something that seems safe, electricity is invisible.. Same about scuba, some things seem safe but there hidden physics that is invisible to inexperienced."

Other than a membership cost training is usually free.  Please don't try and go diving without training or a buddy.  Scuba is built around diving with another person, and training to prepare you for diving safely.  I also strongly recommend having someone on the surface looking out for you while you dive, to help in case something does happen.  If all this sounds too much then I'm afraid diving isn't for you.  Maybe you could snorkel instead, it's not great in the UK but if you're abroad you can see some fantastic stuff."

You can do basic training with a shop but a club gives you people who are going diving and you get to tag along so all the logistics is done. This keeps the costs down when you are already spending too much on kit. Don't however take the first club you find go and interview them first.

In my job as a divemaster if someone had run out of air on a deep dive I would be fired. We have to check air levels of people every 10-15 mins. Even if I didn't have to check that regularly to keep my job I still would. Sometimes I even swim over and check their air gauges myself. I've had people lie to me on an air check to try and get a longer dive, it sounds stupid I know but people do this shit.  I'm in no way critising the OP, he's guiding certified divers who should know better. I work with small groups (max 4 divers to 1 divemaster) I totally understand with larger groups it's a lot harder or impossible to check every individual's air supply, especially in bad vis. I'm in the lucky situation where I can always do air checks when leading a dive. I even check instructors air, who are more qualified than me as a divemaster. If I'm leading a dive I want to know how much air my customers have at all times. I'd urge all divers to do the same when diving, ask your buddy how much air he / she has regularly. Even if you've agreed to tell each other when you reach a certain air level it doesn't hurt to ask them / remind them to check their air.   A lot of the others I can relate to. I've had a diver go down and in two minutes signal he was out of air and start to bolt to the surface. Luckily I managed to grab a lot of him and shove my alt in his mouth before he went up too much and give himeself (or me) the bends. I check his tank, it's not open even though I had reminded everyone to turn on their tanks before entry.

There's a liveaboard that I've done several trips with and not only do they not check our air, there usually isn't a divemaster in the water when we're doing our dives. A trained/certified scuba diver should be perfectly capable of being responsible for themselves. I appreciate being treated as a responsible adult until proven otherwise."
scuba,3b2nup,CatnipFarmer,2,Sun Jun 28 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd like to be able to treat people that way too and just be a guide and not babysit people but you just can't safely in my area. There are far too many companies that are just open water license machines. They will take peoples money and do the bare minimum required to give them a license. Students come out with a license but no idea how to control their buoyancy ect. Our company was dealing with emergency situations about once every month when they let open water divers dive without a professional. Since they made diving with a divemaster compulsory for all divers they've only had 1 emergency situation in the last 15 years.  I wish it was not the case but having a open water license doesn't mean you know how to dive well and safely. The amount of qualified divers who don't check their air, don't ascend slowly, don't dive within limits and don't do safety stops is just too high.  I treat every group differently depending on their experience. If people are good after the first dive I won't baby sit them, if they show me they have good buoyancy, good air consumption, they check their air often and follow safe diving practices then I'll give them space and pretty much let them do what they like as long as it's safe. All I do with good experienced divers is to occasionally check their air and show them where the best spots to see sharks, turtles seahorses ect are.  This is where having a divemaster is great, not only is it safer (even for experianced divers) but you will also see more with a guide who knows the site well, I can almost guarantee it. Even as a professional diver with thousands of dives if I dive in a new area I want a divemaster who knows the area to show me the site, show me where the rare / hard to find stuff likes to hang out."
scuba,3b2nup,Stinkin_Hippy,2,Sun Jun 28 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that a lot of divers are shit shows and there are a lot of awful instructors out there. One advantage of a liveaboard is that it probably attracts people who are a bit more serious about diving."
scuba,3b2nup,CatnipFarmer,2,Sun Jun 28 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"I hear ya bro! If you like to dive as independently as possible, liveaboards are the way to go. Even if they give you a divemaster if he sees you're good he's not gonna baby sit you. Chances are you'll be put in a group which is well suited for you as well. When I worked on liveaboards after the first dive and we saw what each diver was like we would reassign the groups so that all the guys who are good on air and bouyancy can be together so that they're not held back by the shitty divers."
scuba,3b2nup,Stinkin_Hippy,2,Sun Jun 28 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"I am a very inexperienced diver. Don't have more than 30 dives despite getting my OM cert in early 2010. Mainly because I cannot afford diving vacations (or vacations at all really) and because I live in Sweden (also not at the coast). When I lived with my mom and dad I dove fairly regularly, but now...  I will gladly take a refresher course just to make sure I remember everything. Last time I went diving I had to. Because when I go in I want to be prepared.  I am also glad these posts don't scare me away from diving. I love diving when I get the chance. Soon I'll be done with my education and get a nice job (I hope...) which hopefully will give me more chances to dive!"
scuba,3b2nup,knaefraktur,3,Fri Jun 26 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"I would place some serious questions about the diving culture and the quality of the op.   Seems like in many cases the boat dunks unprepared OWs into too hard conditions. People will go after you because you ARE THE GUIDE. How about not guiding OWs into 8ft surface chop dives?  Sure, the money is nice but killing the customer might be little less so. Would love to know the actual names, too many problems/deaths for one pro."
scuba,3b2nup,MasherusPrime,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"""didn't turn their air tank on""  After about 100 dives or so I decided to do the AOW for shits. Very first dive I splashed, I took a breath and I realized I forgot to turn my air back on. But, when kitting up I always double check my pressure then close the valve until we're ready to hop in so I got one breath then nothing. Ahhh that was a fun day and my instructor still doesn't let me forget about it."

Always purge your regulators if you're going to do this! That way your SPG will read 0 and you won't be able to get a breath from the regulator when trying to jump in. Also- do your predive safety checks! :)"

scuba,3b2nup,Autorotator,2,Fri Jun 26 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"I don't understand, for what reason are you turning your air on and off?"
scuba,3b2nup,TacoExcellence,2,Thu Jun 25 18:00:10 2015 UTC,In case there is a small leak you don't want to waste a bunch of air on the way out. You may not be able to hear it with the engine running- but when you get to the site and shut down- you might be able to hear it and then fix it. If your tank is way down- you can't dive.  That said- unless it's a really long boat ride and the leak is bad (bad enough you should be able to hear it over the engines)- then chances are you can't lose enough air to matter.
scuba,3b2nup,stds9tng,2,Thu Jun 25 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"On land, kitting up your gear. Test it all before it goes on the boat. Always purge before it goes on the boat too...    I know people that want to 'not waste my Air' and leave the air in the BCD and Hose lines for that extra 20 seconds of bottom time."
scuba,3b2nup,AussieEquiv,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just mean given that checking your air is part of your pre dive checks, I can't figure out why you'd turn it off after that."
scuba,3b2nup,TacoExcellence,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"Because I test it, on land, at home, possibly even the night before a dive. Right after I set it up.    I was taught not to leave everything pressurised for 12 hours, or even the 2 hour boat ride. Small (ok for diving but not ok for long periods of transfer time) leaks (as mentioned above) are one reason for this.    Finding out your gear is broken 3min before you jump in for a dive often results in you missing that dive. Unless it's something simple like an O-ring. I use DIN, so if I have a gear failure it's usually something more significant. Something that's easier fixed before I leave home."
scuba,3b2nup,AussieEquiv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think you follow, I'm talking about the guy who forgot to turn his air back on. I hope he's not doing his pre dive checks 12 hours before."
scuba,3b2nup,TacoExcellence,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"I just assumed that 'When kitting up' was when he was putting together gear, on land, moments before it's loaded onto the boat. Guess he could have meant, 'when actively putting the BCD on' but who waits to turn their air on until after they have their tank on their back?"
scuba,3b2nup,AussieEquiv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"yup, I'm talking about getting everything ready well before we actually dive. Typically my gear is ready to go a half hour to an hour before we hop in and I see no reason to keep the air on for that time."
scuba,3b2nup,phorkor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:22:22 2015 UTC,"We do a lot of lake/quarry/shore type diving and many times some of us arrive well before some of our slowpoke dive buddies. So, we'll kit up, do our checks then set our gear down by the shore or dock and I normally turn off my air after I check it. Then we wait. Typically I do checks again before splashing, but this time was just the one time I had other things on my mind and overlooked it."

scuba,3b2nup,KennyOfBlok,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:46:40 2015 UTC,"I worked on a boat in the keys and most of these things happen a lot.   On my boat I would check every divers air to make sure that it was turned on before they jumped off. For the divers that would forget and I would catch with closed tanks I would usually make a smart ass remark but not lecture them about predive checks.   There were many days when we had to actively persuade divers that they didn't want to go out in 6-8 foot waves. I would usually tell them ""If I don't run a trip today, I don't get paid today and I don't want to out in that nonsense."" Some would listen, many wouldn't and you would find yourself hooking up to mooring ball in 10ft seas with half the boat puking.  I once had a diver assemble his BCD upside down, i asked him if he was sure he had it assembled right and he got offended and said ""Excuse me, I'm a tech diver.""  In regards to Spiegel Grove Death: People going into real overhead environments without proper training, gear or experience is one the thing that pisses me off the most. The last guy that died on SG had none of these. I have a set of very detailed deck plans of the ship that I'm very reluctant to share with people unless I know they are capable of diving inside the wreck. It's too tempting for a lot of divers to just follow the plans and get in way past where they are capable of getting themselves out. I don't like getting calls to help with body recoveries."
scuba,3b2nup,fredrandall,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"I got my OW some time ago, and my first real dive after my OW was at a dive shop in the keys, the day we got out there there were  6-8 ft waves, and we had to turn around. We were totally ready to go in, but looking back at it, probably would not have been a good idea. We just went the next day and it was fine. I have gone out in high seas after that and its its not so bad, everyone needs to be 100% confident and preferably a small group. It was smart of the captain to turn around that day though."

scuba,3b2bxp,the_mad_scientist,2,Thu Jun 25 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a fear mongering about leisurepro. If it is from grey market (virtually maybe a few items), leisurepro states that the warranty is with them, not the manufacturer. It is not hidden.  Plus, I never heard of non-genuine scuba gear. Scuba gear is so hard to sell, no knock offs are made. Not that I ever heard.  Grey market exists because the product is hard to sell on existing channel (vendors). Thus, it is being moved at cheaper price (by vendors themselves under table) to other (free agents) sellers that don't have agreement with the brand and can sell below set by manufacturer price.  The price is set because a manufacturer doesn't want the channel (vendors) to compete and lower, and lower, and lower the price. After a while, no one can make money because it is virtually sold around the price it was bought from the manufacturer. Then either the product doesn't move since no one is selling it (doesn't bring money) or manufacturer has to lower its wholesale price for another price war to start. Therefore, a manufacturer would want to force a same selling price on its sellers. Thus, chosen vendors enter into a contract on upholding MAP (manufacturer advertised price). The product ONLY sold by manufacturer to these vendors. But it NEVER works out because of the next reason.  However, the manufacturer will sell at lower wholesale price to those vendors in the channel who sell the most of its gear. Thus, punishing those that don't sell well its product and rewarding those who move it. Supposedly, this should work on giving the vendor the most margin between wholesale price and MAP. This becomes like a drug to those vendors, they must continue to hold the sale amount to receive the discount on wholesale. And here is the cancer, these seller become caught in a circle where they need to maintain or exceed the expectations. But after a while they reach amount of product they can push and here comes the ceiling. What to do? Sell some under the table at the low wholesale price they received from the manufacturer to someone else. This way they make a good margin on what they can sell through their business and get rid of what they cannot sell. Thus, this product, the very same product, not fake, gets sold and distributed to other shops. Keeping product in a warehouse that you cannot sell is a HUGE problem for businesses, it costs money (they have to pay tax on product in stock plus the cost for property space they might rent, own - property taxes).   Surely, the manufacturer may refuse the warranty on non-vendor bought item, but the price is so good to a customer vs MAP that some (freedom of choice to buy or not to buy) will buy the item knowing that if it breaks, they will have to pay as if it is out of warranty. Yet, leisurepro gives its own warranty, that is, they keep some of the product for future exchange.  Nowadays, a good brand regulator one wouldn't service for about 2 years anyway. About the same time the warranty runs out. Therefore, buying for less from a grey market is a small risk but usually a good deal.  Therefore, whole grey market stuff is just capitalism at its best. The market is shifting to accommodate itself. No one is trying to kill you."
scuba,3b2bxp,texasguy911,2,Thu Jun 25 22:26:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, you took that more harshly than I intended.   My point with the link was specifically around regulators and other service items. If you buy an Apeks regulator from Leisure Pro it does not come with specific warranty items like free parts for life.   Sure it isn't “hidden” but it's not exactly declared either. There's one Leisure Pro location and if you don't live in New York it's not exactly convenient to wait on them for servicing.   Buy from Leisure Pro items that you won't typically need serviced. Wetsuits, masks, fins, etc. Don't buy computers and regs without fully understanding the situation."

This did happen- and it was LeisurePro.  Leisurepro was selling knockoff ScubaPro gear many years ago. They bought the BCD from the same company that manufactured them for ScubaPro- but the valves were counterfeit and failed.  Here's an article on it:  http://www.undercurrent.org/UCnow/articles/Grey9808.shtml  I also recently bought a piece of gear from them that was manufactured differently than other gear I'd bought from the manufacturer directly. The valve on the LiesurePro item was plastic. The one from the manufacturer was metal. Not sure if it was a lesser model for LP to sell- or if it was just a different manufacturing run- but it concerned me.  Edit:   Yet, leisurepro gives its own warranty, that is, they keep some of the product for future exchange.   Also- just to add to this-  Their warranty is great if you can take advantage of it- but if you're on a trip and need service immediately- you're going to pay for it. Doesn't mean LP is bad- but it's something to consider when making a purchase.  For something like a Suunto computer- where the shop couldn't service it anyway- LP can actually be faster to get a repair. For something like a regulator, however, LP would take longer than bringing it over to whatever shop is closest."
scuba,3b2bxp,stds9tng,2,Fri Jun 26 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"how is saying LP is grey market, aka genuine items but not an authorized dealer, fear mongering? it is an accurate description of some of the gear they carry.  price fixing on gear is partially the fault of LDS dealers too. some authorized dealers support MAP policies because they don't want to compete on price with other shops or internet retailers like LP. margins on gear sales are basically a crutch that keep a lot of shops open. if they sold gear at more realistic prices, most would end up out of business because they aren't making money on anything else."
scuba,3b2bxp,runsongas,3,Fri Jun 26 00:14:42 2015 UTC,margins on gear sales are basically a crutch that keep a lot of shops open.   Margins on sales are what keep the majority stores open. If you think profit margins on gear is too high- profit margins on classes is almost non-existent. Many shops barely break even on training hoping to make their profit on sales.  If you live in an area without a lot of people or a short dive season- you really can't stay in business on just training. At some point you simply need to charge so much for a course that it's cheaper for people to go on vacation and get certified.
scuba,3b2bxp,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:05:24 2015 UTC,"the problem with classes being so cheap that you can't make money is the fault of the scuba industry at large. too many instructors, too many shops using it as a loss leader, and watered down classes.  shops should branch out to more than just training and selling gear. approaches i have seen locally are to offer more trips, start selling gear for other watersports, or using the pool for swim classes.  internet gear sales are not going to go away. dive shops have to adapt or they are going to end up like borders."

Many do- but you can't make much money on trips because people can book them themselves- and it's easy to lose money on them.  Gear sales for other sports have the same Internet sales problem as scuba gear.  Many shops don't even have their own pool or are competing against places like the Y that offer extremely low cost swim lessons.  Running a successful scuba shop is not as easy as you make it sound."
scuba,3b2bxp,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:24:47 2015 UTC,"1) i don't see how they would lose money on trips if caradonna can run a whole business just around it.  2) without MAP on non-scuba items, pricing can be more flexible to compete and still profitable. margin might be lower, but revenue will be higher.  3) most LDS in my area have a pool to run their classes. it would be just utilizing the pool more efficiently in those cases. if the shop doesn't have a pool then the approach is not one that would work for them.  4) Running a profitable LDS isn't easy, but bitching about LP isn't a solution."
scuba,3b2bxp,runsongas,3,Fri Jun 26 23:11:48 2015 UTC,"1) i don't see how they would lose money on trips if caradonna can run a whole business just around it.   They've built their business around it! They have economies of scale that no dive shop can manage. They get significant discounts for bringing a lot of divers to a location.   2) without MAP on non-scuba items, pricing can be more flexible to compete and still profitable. margin might be lower, but revenue will be higher.   Why would revenue be higher? Why would someone go to their LDS to buy something like a waterski? Moreover- if you're just going to sell other stuff- why not skip the scuba stuff entirely? The people who open and run scuba stores are passionate about diving. The more crap you sell- the more your shop becomes nothing more than another Dick's Sporting Goods. I don't know a single scuba store that could compete against a behemoth the size of the big sporting goods places.   3) most LDS in my area have a pool to run their classes. it would be just utilizing the pool more efficiently in those cases. if the shop doesn't have a pool then the approach is not one that would work for them.   I know very few shops that have their own pools. It's expensive and unless you do a ton of training- it generally isn't worth it compared with just renting time in a hotel or health club pool.  Plus- as I said- many people consider swimming a critical life skill and offer low or no cost swim lessons. I have no idea how you could possibly compete against something like the Y programs.   4) Running a profitable LDS isn't easy, but bitching about LP isn't a solution.   First off- I'm not bitching about LP- I was talking about the industry at large. I have purchased many things from LP over the years.  That said: I have bought gear from LP that did not match gear I bought directly from the manufacturer. LP did get caught selling counterfeit gear. LP sold gear online when legitimate stores were prohibited from doing so and built up a reputation and following that legitimate stores could not. I don't like rewarding people for breaking the rules when others were trying to make a living honestly."
scuba,3b2bxp,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:29:16 2015 UTC,"1) and a dive shop can't get a discount for bringing a couple dozen divers for a specific week to a resort?  2) maybe not a jetski, but what about a kayak or surfboard? rebrand the dive shop as a general water sports store. it gets a bigger crowd in the door anyways, possibly even getting some people interested in scuba too. selling anything is extra revenue if you already have to pay for a shop with employees in the first place. selling scuba gear is profitable, just not profitable enough on its own. most of the dive shops here don't have a problem competing with sports chalet.  3) in my example, the pool/shop/employees are already sunk costs. the pool is then empty when a class isn't going on. swim lessons/renting it out/etc is all extra revenue.  sidenote: didn't LP offer refunds on the BC debacle? not that much different than a recall imo."
scuba,3b2bxp,runsongas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"1) and a dive shop can't get a discount for bringing a couple dozen divers for a specific week to a resort?   A couple dozen divers???? You are obviously dealing with a WAY larger LDS than any one I've ever seen. 8-10 divers is the average trip size for any shop I've worked in. Moreover- the value add that shops provide is an instructor who will lead the trip, handle any contingencies, and so on. That cuts into profits. If all you're doing is reselling a trip- why would a customer go to you instead of just booking it themselves or going through a place like Caradonna?  Plus- shops generally need to commit to purchasing a certain number of spots for these trips. If they can't fill it- they're still on the hook for the bookings. As I said- it's nowhere near as east as you're making it out to be.   maybe not a jetski, but what about a kayak or surfboard? rebrand the dive shop as a general water sports store.   Ok- seriously- what scuba stores are you working in? Because outside of places like Florida and California (where watersports are a year round thing) most shops are way too small to carry things like a Kayak or even a surfboard (the shops up here barely have enough room for scuba gear- let alone a bunch of other crap.  Furthermore- there are already shops selling kayaks and surfboards. Why do you think a dive shop can take on a dedicated surf shop or watersports store? Why would I go to my LDS to buy a kayak (which takes up a lot of room and generally doesn't sell like hotcakes) instead of going to a store with better expertise on the subject?"

This puts a shadow of a doubt in readers mind that buying such items can result in purchasing by chance a knock off, lesser grade, non-genuine.

I'm always using some sort of a 'pole' when I have my GoPro with me, whether it be an actual 36"" GoPro pole or mounted to my speargun via the roll bar mount.  Either way the pole or my gun is always tied off my BC with a coil lanyard.  I know others who have tried the head mount and chest mount, but noticed that their head was moving around too much for the the head mount and they could never get the right angle with chest mount.  I've tried the wrist mount but I'm usually hunting something, so my hands are always on the move.  I've never used a stabilizer or gimbal while diving, I seem to have pretty good stability with it mounted to the pole or my gun.  As for lighting, I generally just use a red filter (I'm in 75-100' in South Florida) and usually have pretty good luck with just that and maybe a little editing if I loose my light or get under a cloud.  I've talked to several photogs down here and and they all seem to agree that strobes on a gopro is really worthless for video during day diving.   But it also depends on the clarity, viz, and depth you're diving.  Hope my two cents helps!"

scuba,3awxz2,stds9tng,5,Wed Jun 24 06:40:06 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have any good places to do this?   Look- there are places that will offer you this training but I'm not going to recommend any of them. I'm an IDC staff instructor and the last group of new ""zero to hero"" instructors I watched were laughable. They passed the IE (not saying much) but they had absolutely no skills in the water. Constantly upright, kicking instead of becoming neutral, no ability to shoot an SMB (several dropped their SMB or reel, several more got tangled, and two tried using an oral inflation SMB with their low pressure inflator- needless to say- that didn't work), and so on.  You need experience to teach diving. You need to dive in lots of different conditions. Warm water, cold water, good viz and poor viz, calm water and no current as well as strong currents and choppy water. You need to try as much dive equipment as possible.  If a student asks you for a recommendations for a dive site- what are you going to tell them? ""Well- I did all my training at <blah> so that's what I recommend!""  If they ask you for gear recommendations- what are you going to tell them? Have you dove with a jacket BCD, a back inflate, a backplate and wing, or sidemount?  If they ask what type of diving is out there and what it's like- can you tell them? Have you actually done a wreck penetration? Been diving in a cave (or at least a cavern/cenote)? And so on?  Then there is the theory. People fail the theory section of the IE all the dive. Physics, physiology, equipment, RDP use, and the dive environment all catch people unprepared. You should be reading every book on diving you can get your hands on. Diving Physiology in Plain English, Deco for Divers, Dive Down, and about a dozen other books.   I have looked into Halls and realized that I think they are probably overpriced?   I'd go with ""definitely overpriced""."

scuba,3awxz2,hargikas,3,Wed Jun 24 11:59:05 2015 UTC,"We all know that this is offered in many places, but don't do it if you are thinking the price, or the time it will take  you to become an Instructor.  There many cases when an Instructor comes up for work in a dive center, and in the first days everyone realizes that he is totally underqualified.  Becoming a good scuba instructor is based on many things:   Mastering the theory behind diving and scuba diving. Mastering the skills, the mindset of diving, the psychology behind a diver. Having a lot of experience to share with new and old divers. Mastering the art of teaching and transfering the knowledge and skills. Experience to master self-rescue (an Instructor is actually diving solo while teaching). Experience to indentify problems in the diver, before they actually occur (sometimes it is called 6th sense).   Rushing into making yourself an instructor in an extremely fast period you may master some of the above points, but not all. I am suggesting taking an Open Water Diver Courser, make some dives (fix your boyancy, make the simple techniques be automatic for you (you'll need it at depth)), continue with an Advanced Open Water Diver course. Do far more dives, a little bit more challenging. If you like it, continue to Rescue Diver and if this is what you want to do work as an intern in a dive center to become a Dive Master. After a some months working there, you'll see some cases of panicing divers, see how the instructors you look up for react to that and so on...  The way to Instructor Development Course and the Instructor certification you must already be top of your game. If you become an instructor the really difficult comes.  Here is a good article about that."
scuba,3awxz2,Pollyanna584,3,Wed Jun 24 11:18:23 2015 UTC,"Get your open water and do 50 extra dives.  If you plan on doing this, buy some gear and only rent tanks.  In order to go any further you'll need extra dives and by doing this you'll at least know that you enjoy diving.  After this you can get some other specialties (I learned in Monteray,CA so dry suit was the first I learned :) ) butyou can do cave diving, rescue diving and a lot of other cool ones.  You MAY be able to save a little by buying a package (which tbh I've never seen before) but if you don't finish in their time period you'll be spending much more"
scuba,3awxz2,tropicaldreadlock,3,Wed Jun 24 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"that is what i intended to do two years ago. i went from OW, AOW, to rescue in just months. then i realize there' sooo much to learn and, well, let's just say most of the things you'll learned about diving are not taught in diving courses.  so rack up on experience, get your own gears by the time you're ready to do DM, and probably spend a few months dive master-ing before going for an instructor course. anyway, that's what i'd do if i were me"

The people who spend time actually working as a divemaster have a much easier time passing the IE than those who just get the card and never work as a DM. You learn a lot working with actual students that you won't learn anywhere else.
scuba,3awxz2,texasguy911,2,Wed Jun 24 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"There might be another issue. If you'll take time, you may realize that you, perhaps, no longer want to be an instructor.  Instructor is one of many paths on becoming a good diver. There are other paths that make you even better diver.  1) Cave diver. Go in caves where one cannot assent when troubles arise. All about safety, equipment, teamwork, dive planning, and mental endurance. Even if you become a padi/iss instructor, it will not teach you even a half of this knowledge or buoyancy.  2) Tech diver. Dive to depths were something wrong always results in death. Learn to make no mistakes. Somewhat similar to cave diving skills but not all inclusive. Cave divers usually are tech divers + cave. Through, tech divers might be certified using more gases than an everyday cave diver.  3) Become a commercial diver. Good money but only a few can, very risky, physically exhausting, usually away from home and civilization (hard to have a private life).  Thus, being an instructor is a calling. Over and over you teach people how to clear a mask. One just has to love it, since it is over and over, and over again. Otherwise you'll burn out. Instructor is also all about sales, do you love to be a salesman? Being a good instructor and a poor salesman can make you unable to work as instructor. Do you know more than one language? Anyone who knows even one more language than you is more desirable. Are you ready for internal politics where competition burns bridges and will to go on? Are you ready to assume a HUGE legal risk while making little money for it?"
scuba,3awxz2,scuba_platypus,2,Thu Jun 25 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will knock that approach but it really depends how you do it. The most important thing is getting a lot of dives in. I did similar nothing to DM in 3 and a half months, at the end i had over 200 dives, most of which were assisting on courses. Amusingly this was more that a lot of instructors I know! It was the cheapest way for me to go diving the fact I got offered work at the end was just a bonus."

So you had 200 dives- all in the same conditions, with the same people, on the same boats. I'm guessing it was all tropical waters?  If you're going to be a professional- you should have as diverse an experience as possible. Dive with lots of different operations, in lots of different conditions (boat, shore, warm, cold, etc.) and with lots of different equipment."

You literally have nothing to compare your diving to.  If you have to refer your students to another instructor to answer every question- then why shouldn't they just dive with that instructor in the first place?  When I teach I get asked questions all the time about things like cave diving, wreck diving, rebreathers, and so on. I can answer their questions and help guide them because I've done it.  Not only that- but doing a wide variety of diving in a lot of different places means I've been able to meet instructors and divers from all over the world. In the cases where I don't have any expertise- I have a lot of people I can refer them to. That's basically impossible to do if you've done the zero to hero thing- diving in the same place with the same people for months on end."

Beards are always a bit of a problem. Try using some petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on your beard to help prevent leakage.   I dove many years ago with a family member and used something that only inflated in the back. That seemed much more comfortable. Is that still a thing? Do you have any preferences in this area?   Called, not surprisingly, a back inflation BC. These are prefered by a lot of people because they clean up your chest resulting in less clutter. They have different buoyancy characteristics and can take some getting used to on the surface (they tend to pitch you forward on the surface). The ""ultimate"" (for lack of a better word) form of back inflation BCD is a backplate and wing. Whether this is the right choice for you will depend on a lot of things. If you can try one first- by all means do so.   I would expect them to all do the same thing, but apparently some are better at keeping you alive.    Almost any regulator from a reputable brand will be fine. You generally want a balanced regulator. Whether you go with a diaphragm or a piston depends on the type of diving you will be doing. Diaphragms are often environmentally sealed and will be more reliable in cold water (less likely to freeze and free flow).   Computer: I'm a watch guy so I'm not looking for something to wear daily between dives like I see many people doing.   The basic computer recommended to new divers is the Suunto Zoop. Works well enough, is simple, and inexpensive.   I'm guessing none of my surfing suits will work. Am I better off getting a thicker dive suit or biting the bullet and going for a dry suit? The water here is in the 60s.   Surfing wetsuits are generally made of lighter more compressible neoprene for better flexibility- but it will compress more during the dive resulting in less warmth. A drysuit is awesome- but they are harder to dive (you need to control buoyancy in the drysuit and in your BCD). They are also expensive.  Whether or not you can dive in 60 degree water with a wetsuit will depend on your personal tolerance. Plenty of people dive in water that cold with wetsuits (7mil + a hooded vest usually). Myself- I'm diving dry if the water is colder than 75 degree- but I'm a wuss."

scuba,3avj2s,butterbal1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:08:04 2015 UTC,Well said!  To add on just a bit I would recommend trying your surf wetsuits and see how you feel.  For some people they wind up getting cold and others are entirely comfortable.  I have been on many dives in just a rashguard and fairly comfortable while others in the group are in 7mill or drysuits were saying they got cold. Just have to see how you do in the water.
scuba,3avj2s,texasguy911,3,Tue Jun 23 23:18:08 2015 UTC,"BCD: Plate and wing what you are talking about. Have to buy them separately. One wing, one plate (aluminum or steel - with steel being heavier - for cold diving), webbing, some trinkets that go onto the webbing, maybe a single tank adapter, 2 cumbands to hold the tank. Probably around $600 for a good set. Can be had as cheap as $300 new. The plate can be of any brand, some make them a bit longer for tall guys. Some make them heavier. If you don't know which one to buy, I'd go with Hollis, nice finish. For a wing I'd go with Oxycheq, it is great on so many levels (but pricey). Overall, I found that an aluminum plate is not worth it. You still put on weights even diving Caribbean, thus, might as well get a steel version.  Hot price:   http://www.piranhadivemfg.com/item/Stainless-Steel-Backplate-Hot-Deal-13143 Cheap steel but seems light weight-wise from description. I'd go for 7-8 pound ones but they can cost $150+.  http://www.piranhadivemfg.com/item/Hog-Hogarthian-Harness-BLACK-13069 This is just the webbing. I bought myself like 20 feet of regular webbing (on his site) and made my own. Cheaper. Add trinkets from a link somewhat below.  http://www.diverightinscuba.com/tanksaccysponybracketsstagekitsstas-hollis-singletankadaptersta-p-2032.html  http://www.leisurepro.com/p-xsstbcb/xs-scuba-tank-bands-with-stainless-steel-cam-buckles-pair  http://www.caveadventurers.com/oxycheq-mach-v-signature-series-wings.html  (they come in so many colors but I am showing you black) I know it is pricey but call them on the phone, usually they can shave some $$$ off if you ask.  These are different trinkets you can add on webbing: https://www.divegearexpress.com/hardware  Regulators: Doesn't really matter. Anything semi-expensive will work very well. I'd get a cheapest Atomic. All Atomic breath the same, same design, the price is influenced by different metals that they use. To tell the truth, even their cheapest will breath as the most expensive one. Maybe it will not last 15 years... But, as a new diver, you'll change your gear anyway. There are phases, you see, you get to know scuba better, you change your outlook and gear anyway. Get the cheapest Atomic for now. Two second stages and one first stage. There are cheaper alternatives. But you might just want something that is popular and works well for now. And, Atomic can be serviced anywhere. Atomic cannot be bought on-line (with warranty), I think, need to visit your local dive shop.  I'd recommend something like this: http://www.caveadventurers.com/hog-single-tank-regulator-package.html But it is a bit hard to find who can service.   This might be easier to service: http://www.caveadventurers.com/hollis-212-dc1-regulator-set.html but you'll need an extra safety, maybe extra $200.  Computer: I like Oceanic computers. I have VT4 and Bud as a backup. You can have Bud for like $200 and it is very simple, easy to use, one button operation, does nitrox too. Again, computers usually come at different price points. However, my weekly diving computer is Bud. You cannot put it on you hand strap, it doesn't have a backlight. But, you can always buy later the one you'd want as a main one and continue to use Bud as your backup. Computers change on the market like every 2 years. Nowadays a color screen is all the rage. Maybe a wireless transmitter (I have one but it is not a must have feature at all). Problem with color screens, you have to charge or change batteries like every so many dives. In LCD ones, maybe once in two years. I prefer battery life, I don't want to forget to charge one more device before the dive. I think choice of a computer is very personal and is so much varies between people on what features they put value. I don't think there are any bad ones that are released in the last 2 years. They all have the basic set of features. It is just choosing what fancy shmancy features you want and what you can afford.  Wetsuit: I'd look for cheaper ones, O'neill, Cressi, Aqualung. I would not buy a 7mm wetsuit if you have money for a drysuit. 7mm is very uncomfortable, you feel like a Micheline man. However, the price of a drysuit is not just the drysuit, you will have to buy undergarments that can set cost another $300-$500 and other upgrades. I bought a drysuit for like $1000. But I spend $700 plus on-top to ""complete the set"" to make it diveable (like rock boots $100, socks $30, underwear undergarment $100). You see, drysuit can add up. Surfing suits won't work because the neoprene is different, it is more soft for surfing. At depth it would become too thin to provide enough of thermal protection. Therefore, you need scuba grade neoprene that doesn't compress as well.  3mm I'd recommend: http://dixiediver.com/shopping/products/209-Lycra-Skins-&-Rash-Guards/2249-DEEPSEE-AQUALUNG-3MM-QUANTUM-STRETCH-MEN/  For under wet-suit I'd get something like this: http://www.leisurepro.com/p-csbs1/cressi-skin-rash-guard-suit-black Even if you wear a shorty or none at all, helps against jellies and other crap that might leave a mark. It is very thin, under a wetsuit it adds another layer of warmth and makers a wetsuit slide on easier, specifically - legs.  PS: Put some silicone grease on your mustache where mask is touching it but don't over-do it."
scuba,3avj2s,stds9tng,2,Tue Jun 23 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"PS: Put some silicone grease on your mustache where mask is touching it but don't over-do it.    Don't put silicone grease on your mustache. The mask skirt is made of silicone and the lighter weight silicone grease will break it down. If you're ever used diesel fuel to get asphalt off your hands- you've seen the process in action. The lighter weight diesel fuel acts as a solvent for asphalt just as silicone grease will act as a solvent for the silicone in your mask skirt.  NSFW: The following link talks about using silicone lubricant with adult toys but the concerns are the same:  http://101.lubezilla.com/featured-stories/how-do-you-know-if-your-lubricant-is-sex-toy-friendly/  ""However, it is important to keep silicone lubes away from toys that are made of or contain silicone. While this may sound counter intuitive, silicone lube and silicone toys (and really, most soft toys including jelly, sil-a-gel, etc) want to both be the same. Ergo, if you use silicone lube on silicone toys, the lube will start to solidify onto the toy, and the toy will start to melt into the lube, leaving you with a toy that has a melted cheese like consistency on the outside."""

scuba,3avj2s,runsongas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:07:11 2015 UTC,Fwiw I live in Vancouver and dive wetsuits.  In the water is fine.  Out of water is horrible.  Bring a cooler of hot water with you if you decide wet.  I have a bare 7/8 semi dry and it's fine.   The worst part about a back zip suit is the water rushing in.  The front zip doesn't do that.
scuba,3avj2s,ejs6591,3,Sat Jun 27 17:27:00 2015 UTC,rent some different gear before you put money down. estimate what type of diving you plan on doing and how often before spending money. don't feel like you have to buy everything at once.
scuba,3avj2s,LackTheWitForFunnySN,2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"I am unsure of the beard issue but I am sure someone here will be able to offer you advice in that area.   As for any equipment it is always most important to find what has good fit and comfort for you, we are all made differently. With that being said I highly recommend Zeagle for BCDs because each piece is fitted to your body dimensions. I have been diving with a Zeagle Ranger for years (back inflate) for basically the same reason you said. I don't like how the vest inflates fit me. If you are able to you should rent or at least try on a few different types of BCDs to find which style you like but check the Zeagles they have a great selection for all skill and career levels.   My regulator is Hollis SE500 with DC7 kit. My second stage is a side mounted exhaust so the bubbles don't blow up in my face, its the only one I have used since I got certified so I am also ignorant when it comes to regulators. Check out the different exhaust styles though. Mine is equally balanced so that it functions the same no matter which way I put it in or which direction I am facing.   Computer I use a house mounted because I am forgetful and would jump off the boat forgetting to put my watch computer on so I just stick to the hose.   If you can afford the drysuit it is always nice but if not you can wear a 7mm suit with hood and potentially a rash guard or vest if you want for additional warmth. I regularly dive in water that reaches 52 after the thermal layer and have never had an issue with staying warm. However a surfing wetsuit wouldn't do the trick.   I hope that helps some."

scuba,3as3qr,Trojaneuph,2,Tue Jun 23 01:46:55 2015 UTC,May not work out.  I did this for my certification dives.  The watch was rated to 30m but after my first dive (only went down 30 feet) it had water in it.  By the end of certification it was half full of water and had died.  I would suggest not spending $10 on a watch.  Look at the $15 or $20 ones.
scuba,3as3qr,atomicrobomonkey,5,Tue Jun 23 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"30m does not actually mean 30m.  It's actually meant to mean 3 atmospheres of pressure, and that's enough for a little swimming and hand washing, nothing more.  Source: watch aficionado."
scuba,3as3qr,wkfink,2,Tue Jun 23 03:06:39 2015 UTC,Then they should label watches in atm.  At 10m underwater you have 2atm of pressure.  It's kinda false advertising to label it in m.
scuba,3as3qr,atomicrobomonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to do that accurately. In reality, the force of you diving into the water creates more pressure on the seals just by swimming, and they can't account for that.  It's why all of the ""dive watches"" from serious brands are at least 200m water resistant, with Rolex, Omega, etc all being 300m+.  Also, those bands generally do put their ratings in ATM on the case back, but most of the general populace doesn't know what that means."

I had swam with it before, but the first time I took it under for a long period of time it filled with water. My friends called me dumb and said that you're not supposed to dive with 30m water resistant watches, they're only for getting splashed. I cannot imagine what getting splashed with water that's 30 meters deep is like, but I have a hard time believing that me or the watch are coming out unscathed."
scuba,3as3qr,jrubal1462,4,Wed Jun 24 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"They only call it ""resistant"" because with enough pressure water will get into any watch.  Even if you look at professional dive watches that cost thousands of dollars they will say water resistant."

Stuhrling is not a reputable watch brand. They are akin to Invicta, in that they have a massive markup on their watches, but regularly sell them for ""90% off"".  If you are looking for a reliable and cheap dive watch, you should be looking at Casio, Citizen, or Seiko.  You are looking at 100m rating and higher, nothing else will be okay diving at any depth."

You have to read the fine print because all those lofty depths they talk about are a bait and switch.  Water resistant to 100m!!!!   But in the fine print it says explicitly not for scuba diving.   So you're going to be boned on warranty when it floods, and it probably will.   BEFORE you buy the watch you have to look at the manual that comes with it to find the section where it explains what the water- proof/resistant [depth] ACTUALLY means.   For example, Casio G-shocks 200M or deeper are actually designed for diving.   The 50/100/150M are all explicitly not for diving.  tl;dr read the manual before you buy to find out if the watch is actually rated for scuba"

scuba,3as3qr,uniSean,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"This is a VERY none standard requirement. From 4 years of diving I never heard of it and I read different scuba forums almost daily. I dive almost every weekend, now throughout the year since I bought a drysuit. Thus, I am very invested in the hobby financially and knowledge wise.  The only time people get them is when their computer doesn't show current regular time and people want to know. Sure, it can be used as a bottom timer, as your shop wants, but that is retarded. Why? Because most people just get a computer backup, that is, a second computer that does a same algorithm. For example, I have Oceanic VT4 and Oceanic Bud for a backup. If one fails, and it did fail one time, I just switch to another without missing a beat. Both of them failing is very, very unlikely, like one in a million. Why a second computer? Because without tables with you present in hand, it is useless. Also, if you do, say a liveaboard, and your computer fails... What are you going to do, stay down for 20 mins while trying to calculate 3 days worth of nitrogen loading underwater? Very unlikely. You'd need all the numbers with you from the previous dives, tables, then hope that you are not narced enough to make a math error. There is a reason that if people are using tables, they calculate on the surface before the dive. Doing it underwater is not proper. If you have just one computer and it fails, guess what, go up. If you have a 2nd computer, it has same calculations that are unavailable on the broken one, just continue dives with it. I am fine with instructors teaching tables, however, never seen anyone to rely on a watch in case their computer fails. Does not make much sense. You either use a watch as a bottom timer for a per-caclulated dive or just to read current time.  Therefore, it is very odd to require a watch when most people go for 2 computers. You may say that it is unreasonable to require a student to have 2 computers. I agree. That is why it is NEVER asked by other instructors, from what I heard on forums throughout the years, and people discuss everything odd. Just never this."

scuba,3asug9,AussieEquiv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:36:39 2015 UTC,A suggestion I have is to take something white with you (best option is a slate) and take one photo of it or with it in it at depth so you have a white benchmark. That way you can white balance off of it. I would also suggest Adobe Lightroom. It's great full of features and if you do Creative cloud it's a small fee a month I believe.   Hope that helps. Cheers

Be aware that in most of S/E asia boat dives aren't that much more expensive than shore dives.

scuba,3aqm0z,briseymo1,3,Mon Jun 22 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"Water wouldn't fill the entire suit, especially towards the middle areas where my thighs, stomach and chest were.   Sounds like it's a tight fitting wetsuit with good seals. Have you tried simply pulling open the neck a little bit when you get in the water to let the air out?"
scuba,3aqm0z,stds9tng,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"Kind of, but I didn't really put a lot of effort into. I opened the neck more so to let water in than to let air out. I don't think there's a difference in the too, haha, but that was my intention."
scuba,3aqm0z,stds9tng,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:02:24 2015 UTC,Well the way a wetsuit keeps you warm is by restricting the amount of water that can get in or out. The layer of water between you and the suit is just a side effect of it being a wet suit- but that water doesn't keep you warm (you had to warm it up after all). If water could move in and out easily- you would quickly become hypothermic. It sounds more like your wetsuit fits you perfectly- far better than most people are able to achieve.
scuba,3aqm0z,stds9tng,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:18:16 2015 UTC,Oh. Well great then. Maybe I'll just have to throw on some extra weight the next time I dive.

scuba,3aqm0z,texasguy911,2,Mon Jun 22 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"That's probably the problem.   According to this site here you need 19 pounds of weight:  http://www.divebuddy.com/calculator/weight.aspx  Nothing wrong with your suit, you shouldn't be diving without extra weight.  In the peak buoyancy course, you need to be able to sit in the water with a lungful of air with an empty BCD and sink to eye level.   And then you exhale and you should sink slowly to the bottom.    If you aren't sinking the solution isn't to talk about the wetsuit; it's to look at your weights."
scuba,3aqm0z,ThePurpleRabbit,2,Mon Jun 22 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that site should be a ""baseline"" number that you start from then try to remove excess weight.  I normally dive with ~12 lbs (still trying to lower that) and the above site tells me I should use 19. Pool time is your friend!"
scuba,3aqm0z,nigelh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:35:28 2015 UTC,I need 4kg minimum with 7mm wetsuit in a lake. Thicker suits need more weight to sink under. Some people dive 10kg+steel tank.   So you know how to do the buoyancy test in water?

You have this backwards. There is no reason you would switch to air after starting on nitrox. You might start on nitrox and then switch to a low oxygen trimix mixture at the bottom- but as /u/wadamw said- that's much more advanced diving (either ""advanced trimix"" or ""hypoxic trimix"" depending on the certifying agency).

As the links I supplied show- pricing here in the US is completely different. For a while the Petrel was actually less expensive than the Suunto which made buying a Suunto even less sensible.
scuba,3aocxn,UnderwaterNerd,2,Mon Jun 22 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"Why a Suunto computer? I haven't heard great things about their computers, apart from one person who raved about the amazing EON (which did look nice). Things like deco lockout and failing transmitters make me generally avoid them. I haven't looked up the proprietary algorithm either.  If you're looking for a watch-like computer, Oceanic makes some nice ones, namely the Geo 2.0 ($399) and OCI ($849).  If you think technical diving is in your future (1-2 years out), why not grab a Petrel ($750) and stick with that. Even if you're solely a recreational nitrox diver it's a nice computer at a competitive price, compared to others like the Liquivision Koan ($749).    Disclaimer: I use a Petrel."

scuba,3aocxn,eanx100,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:11:09 2015 UTC,I currently use a dx and it's an amazing computer. Built very sturdily and has a lot of great bells and whistles. Some people say that it dives a bit on the conservative side but I haven't noticed much difference from an oceanic. Also works as an everyday watch which is a plus. I'd give it a 9/10 mostly because the tank pairing with the transmitter is a bit finicky. It has never actually failed to pair for me but it has taken upwards of 5 minutes to get it to work.

scuba,3aocxn,UnderwaterNerd,-2,Tue Jun 23 14:51:22 2015 UTC,Do not buy a Suunto computer. The RGBM algorithm is crappier than crap. Do some research on the algorithms before deciding what computer may suit you the best. The most important part of a computer is the algorithm. Not the bells and whistles or the price.
scuba,3aocxn,stds9tng,2,Mon Jun 22 11:34:16 2015 UTC,I agree.  Their algorithm is too conservative for me.  If you ever plan on taking more advanced dives you will likely find their algorithm is too conservative.  It all depends on what your future dive plans will require but I'm in the process of selling mine once I finish my next dive trip.
scuba,3aocxn,UnderwaterNerd,0,Mon Jun 22 16:00:57 2015 UTC,Also it's fused RGBM nowadays. Not as conservative and works better for deep dives. Maybe do some research on the algorithms before slandering a company on the internet?
scuba,3aocxn,stds9tng,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:06:26 2015 UTC,Also it's fused RGBM nowadays.   How do I adjust the conservatism for my dives with RGBM on a Suunto? For example- if I like deeper stops and want to weight the algorithm that way- what setting should I configure? If the water is warmer and I am willing to push closer to the limit- how would I set that? If I set it to be conservative- but want the option of ending a dive quickly in an emergency- how do I know what's actually safe and what isn't?
scuba,3aocxn,unclesandwicho,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:14:14 2015 UTC,The algorithm automatically switches when you go past a certain depth. There isn't an option to change the conservatism of the algorithm yourself but messing with the altitude should yield the same result (I still don't recommend it) As for water temperature I believe it automatically takes that into account with the temperature sensor and adjusts your NDL accordingly (I'll have to look this one up to be sure though).  As far as emergencies go it has an ascent rate alarm and a ceiling alarm that should warn you if you do anything to risky on an emergency ascent.
scuba,3aocxn,UnderwaterNerd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"My personal preference is to use an algorithm with slightly less voodoo (automatically adjusting for x, y, or z) and that I understand.  If I cut a set of tables on my desktop- I would like the algorithm on my computer to match. I can't think of any way to do that with a Suunto and their customer RGBM algorithm.  Shearwater uses Buhlmann ZHL16C with Gradient Factors and it's both easy to understand, and easy to match to your desktop planning software. Anyone who spends a few minutes reading up on Gradient Factors can easily understand what they mean and then customize them for their preferences. Random ""conservatism"" options are much less transparent and harder to customize.  Moreover- with a computer like the Petrel you can set the screen to display things like @+5 or GF99 so you can see your deco obligation if you stay 5 minutes more or see how close you're getting to the Buhlmann line.  Suunto doesn't make a bad computer- there are definitely better options for someone considering technical diving."

scuba,3ao7au,chem2617,4,Mon Jun 22 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend getting into a GUE Fundamentals course. It'll lay a solid foundation for any technical diving you want to do in the future.   Fitness is important from a gas-exchange perspective during decompression, moving heavy gear around (possibly on a rocky boat) and most importantly if you need to assist another diver who's also loaded with heavy gear. You're probably fine based on what you wrote.   The gear is expensive but it doesn't have to be wild. It's entirely possible to score quality used gear. At a minimum you need a set of doubles (lp85s are ideal), a deco bottle (al80), two backgas regs, deco bottle reg, primary and backup lights, smb, a suit inflation bottle and drysuit for balancing those heavy steel doubles and due to length of the dive. If you're diving double al80s you can get away with a wetsuit if you're in the tropics. Being warm is important for deco."
scuba,3ao7au,CaveDiver1858,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:51:17 2015 UTC,What is the difference between back gas regs and normal regs?
scuba,3ao7au,CaveDiver1858,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"On a set of doubles you need two 1st stage regs each with one 2nd stage. Compared with a single tank rig with one 1st stage and two 2nd stages. For technical diving, DIN 1st stages are preferred.   The term ""back gas"" is used to distinguish the function of the regs from stage/deco regs. Deco and stage regs have one 1st stage and on 2nd stage."
scuba,3ao7au,SevenTreeIsle,2,Tue Jun 23 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"Equipment can be expensive, but if you build it up over time as you progress through technical training it won't feel too bad.  I'll focus on backmount, which for most scenarios will be the better way to go for open water technical diving.  A backplate/wing set up can be $400 to 800, but will last you more or less forever (and with a single tank adapter and wing, can become your recreational rig too). You can probably find two used 80cf tanks for a good price, and then just buy bands, valves and manifold for $200 or so. Then you'll need two 1st and 2nd stages, along with an inflator whip and spg. Might be able to work a bit with what you already have, but otherwise you can get a complete set for $600 from some places, though this is probably where you want to spend more money if you can afford it (personally I am fully dedicated to Apeks regs, which are a bit pricier but I love them). Your current computer, if it has a ""bottom timer"" mode, will suffice, otherwise you'll need a bottom timer. Generally speaking, you don't need a $1000 ""technical computer"" at the start, though down the road you might make the choice to use one.  All of that gets you in the water to start technical training. As you progress you'll add deco bottles, which by the time you pay for the tank, hardware, and nitrox-ready/O2-ready reg, you'll be around $400-500 each, depending on tank size. Ask around though, you might be able to pick up used deco bottles.  As for training agency, as you've probably heard before, it's more about the instructor than the agency. TDI and IANTD are well respected and have been teaching technical classes for decades. PADI's TecRec is actually a pretty decent program despite PADI's rather bad reputation. Again, find the right instructor first, worry about the agency after that. The training is intense, but you will build up to it. I LOVED my technical training, was outstanding to be challenged in the water.  As for finding a shop, ask around, chat with anyone you know that is doing technical diving in your area. Shops love technical students as they tend to buy lots of gear, just make sure you find a good, experienced instructor.  Take your time, enjoy it, and you'll have a really good time."
scuba,3ao7au,Lergerndery,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:34:00 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity why backmount vs side mount? I've always been attracted to side mount because I feel like you can get through tight places a little easier.
scuba,3ao7au,texasguy911,2,Mon Jun 22 13:03:08 2015 UTC,Backmount/manifold you don't have to switch regs and worry about keeping your tanks balanced. Sidemount has it's advantages as you have a smaller profile and can fit thorugh some tighter restrictions without removing your gear but you have to switch tanks every so often and keep a very close eye on both tanks to keep your air consumption on each even. Technical diving doesn't necessarily cover pentration diving or diving in which you have overhead  restrictions like you would if you go inside a wreck or a cave. Make sure you pursue that kind of training as well.
scuba,3ao7au,SevenTreeIsle,2,Mon Jun 22 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"I am doing a sidemount for 12 months already. By now switching regs is not a problem, no more a bother than switching on/off a flashlight. Sure, it is odd at first and got to keep a mental alarm that reminds you to switch. However, later it becomes a second nature. The good thing is, now I am so accustomed to purge a regulator before taking a first breath, I am doing it without thinking. When I was diving a backmount, changing a regulator was like never/never but maybe testing it before the descent, it led me not to have the automatic regulator purge skill, had to think about it and forgot a few times. No more, nowadays I switched so many times.  A problem with sidemount is getting in/out of the the water from a boat. There are charters that will lower your tanks on a rope and pull them at the end of the dive, but not all will accommodate. Definitely sucks with big waves. I did a liveaboard with a sidemount, I was the only one like that. I was given 2 ropes and a ring for each. I clipped my tanks to each ring with snap bolts that were already attached to my tanks. Then I lowered each tank before the dive. Dove in harness but without tanks. Put tanks in the water. It is not easy at first, need this touch memory what goes where, how to rotate your body for minimum effort. Even my cave diving buddy says he never put his tanks while unable to touch the bottom, so it is a specialized skill. After putting everything in, you got to remember to hookup the air lines.  Other than that, I love it.  PS: When people are listing reg changing as a bother for sidemount option, it is not. (Or it becomes - not)"
scuba,3ao7au,texasguy911,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:34:04 2015 UTC,For back mount then do you need two sets of regs/first stages/spgs like you do with side mount or just one and a whip and band to connect the two tanks?
scuba,3ao7au,SevenTreeIsle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"Both sidemount and backmount have their advantages. Backmount is simpler (no reg-changing), is easier to work with when boat diving, and makes carrying deco/stage bottles easier. Sidemount is potentially more comfortable, offers true redundancy, puts your valves/1st stages right in front of you where they are more protected and easier to manipulate, and can get you into smaller spaces, though it will suck if you enter an upright or upside down wreck (too wide).  Personally, for most ocean diving I believe backmount is the better system, particularly when you are going deeper and carrying multiple gasses. I love sidemount, but it is far better suited to the caves for which was originally designed. Boat diving in sidemount, with deco/stage bottles, waves, and surface current, pretty much sucks. Then again my sidemount harness (Razor) is very much designed for caves; there are better options if you're going to be doing open water diving.  Either way will work, you'll have to make your own choice. I admit to being a bit skeptical of the recent push for sidemount as a backmount replacement. They each have their strengths and weaknesses, and neither is the best choice for every situation. Ideally you'll learn both, and then be in a position to select the right tool based on the conditions."
scuba,3ao7au,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for ocean a Razor might be a tad too easy to rip/destroy with waves and all, it is kind of flimsy. However, I dove SMS100 and it felt solid with big waves.  I wouldn't discount sidemount for ocean diving. Got to love to be able to lay down some bottles down, pick newones, exchange with another person, etc."

scuba,3ao7au,nigelh,2,Tue Jun 23 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"195ft? so 59 meters to my thinking so you can do it on a normoxic trimix. That is one you can still breathe on the surface. That's a pretty standard starter trimix course. The dive is easy. The how to manage something breaking and still not die takes practice and planning. You'll usually need a nitrox decompression diving course first and a few logged deco dives before doing this one.  The snag with trimix, especially when you go below 60 meters, is that you have gas in tanks that can kill you so there is no ""Getting a working regulator and breathing solves any problem"" now. You have to know what you are breathing and why at every point in the dive. Also when the 'glass ceiling' of decompression closes over you then you need your plan-B planned.  Good luck with it. Deep wrecks seem to be less trashed and more historically interesting than the shallow ones."
scuba,3ao7au,riikkiie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:54:59 2015 UTC,Are there gas mixes you use around 80m that can not be used at the surface?   I'm asking because there was an accident last may where 2 people died along the coast of Italy going for an 80m wreck dive source  It was stated that they got ill when in the water on the surface. I've never grasped how this could happen.
scuba,3ao7au,MassuguGo,3,Mon Jun 22 13:55:02 2015 UTC,The problem is Oxygen. Breathe less than about 0.16 bar partial pressure of oxygen and you don't put enough oxygen into your tissues and the world just fades away forever. Breathe more than about 1.6bar and your nervous system overloads and you can convulse. This is very bad if your life depends on keeping that reg in your mouth and doing your deco properly. Hence at the surface you need at least an 18% O2 mix so you have some margin for staying alive but at 60 meters that is 1.5 bar so you are getting too close for comfort if you go deeper.  That's the limiting factor that makes the difference between a normoxic trimix and a hypoxic trimix where your deep gas is say 10% O2 so you have a comfortable mix at depth but you now need to carry a 'travel gas' to use from the surface going down because 10% O2 will kill you.  Then add high oxygen decompression mixes and you have a bunch of tanks and you need a good plan B because you have more things to break. Naturally the deep mixes are cut with helium or you are narked out of your mind and you won't know what you are doing anyway.  Trimix diving opens sites you could not reach but it is a minefield. You cannot make mistakes because it is very unforgiving. Regs working at say 10 times the surface pressure where they were tested and serviced must be good and trustworthy. You need a good gas plan because you need 'enough' gas to breathe at each depth and you need some reserves for something breaking.  OK I admit I'll only dive to hypoxic depths on the rebreather as that blends my mix as I dive. However I still have two 'backup' tanks hung from me with something to breathe if the rebreather quits. In my case they are 12L 300bar cylinders and I have a chart that tells me what time they enough gas to do the ascent from. I'm not sure what 12/300s are in the American terminology but they are big and they are heavy.  Sorry it's a bit of a ramble. This is the stuff they cover properly for you on a Trimix course. This just gives you the flavour.

It really depends how deep you go, at about 100ft/30m it can get to about 10c but it's much warmer higher up (18m it's about 15-18c). I'd go with a 7mm and if you have low tolerance for cold bring a well-fitted vest or lavacore to go underneath. It's really not that bad with that and a thicker hood - I go with 9mm these days but have done lots of dives with a 3mm.

scuba,3al8co,Ollava,3,Sun Jun 21 08:09:24 2015 UTC,"I like sidemount for some kinds of diving. It seems like it would be really nice for caves or shore diving where you have a long walk to the dive site.  Most of my tech diving is wreck diving in currents where the boat drops you as a hot drop, so you don't have the opportunity to set up in the water. I have seen a lot of guys struggle to get their primaries hooked up and sling 2 stages while on a rocking boat. The sidemount setup is also wider, so they have more difficulties getting through hatchways in ships that lie upside down or right side up. If the ship is on its side, the sidemount diver has more room.  I like my manifold and not having to switch regulators every few minutes to keep my cylinders balanced.   It really depends on what kind of diving you do and what your personal preferences are. I wouldn't limit myself to just sidemount or backmount because not every dive is the same, but for the majority of the dives I do, I think back mounted doubles are the better option."
scuba,3al8co,wadamw,3,Sun Jun 21 11:08:35 2015 UTC,"I love sidemount. I have a pretty bad back and almost all of my diving is shore and the tech deco stuff I do is on boats with folks who understand my back issues so they'll let me load up one tank, jump in, and hand me the rest. If the water is too choppy, they still help me load all the tanks on and I feel like having the weight in line instead of on my back helps a lot.   No, I don't find myself in many situations that require me to remove tanks to squeeze through small openings. But that's not all sidemount is about. You'll hear people say it's just say to complicated cause you gotta switch regs at intervals of air, but it's really not bad. Is it ideal for every dive ever? No. For a while I was helping certify people in my SM kit, but that was just for practice and to show beginners what other options of diving are. But a singles rig makes way more since in that situation. BM doubles have their own place, too! I just find the independent doubles a little safer for deep wreck (my goal) because I lose the failure point of the manifold and the valves are right under my arms, being protected by my squishy bits.  I also love what another guy at my shop hates about it... No GUE standardized DIR setup. If you get a rig set up and it works well and safely for you but it's not exactly a 7' primary with cave line clips and a 24"" backup with a necklace and your lights are tied off in one way, so on... It still is accepted in SM. Most of the people I know who SM are very interested in new configurations of gear. Within reason and safety, of course.  Oh, and modding gear... Yeah, you have to mod gear if you want it to be really awesome. But  the scubapro rig I'm playing with didn't need a whole lot of modding and could easily have been used for anything less than mutli-stage deco without a single change (only one set of chest d-rings).  I know other rigs would work fine without it. And sidemount isn't only a technical diving setup. It's doubles, but sometimes I just want more air even if I'm in the water at 35' for 30 minutes with students."

scuba,3al8co,Smellzlikefish,0,Mon Jun 22 10:32:22 2015 UTC,"Sidemount is good for cave and wreck diving where penetrations are the norm.  I never caught the cave bug and unless a wreck has some sort of history behind it, I'm not interested.  I go underwater for the biology and like the ability to be in the water and travel fast.  I took a couple of sidemount divers on a manta dive recently and they were a PIA.  Between the prep time required to set up their gear, the fact that they couldn't efficiently walk across the deck of the vessel, and then once underwater they were useless if they weren't sitting trim and horizontal were all huge turn offs.  The cult-like DIR mindset has never appealed to me either and I have yet to meet a side mounter that isn't packed full of the techie rhetoric.  My single tank with backplate setup is ready for reef, blue water, light caverns, and wrecks.  For anything but wrecks and caves, it just seems like someone trying to reinvent the wheel."

Sidemount is not DIR so I am not sure why you're comparing them.    I have yet to meet a side mounter that isn't packed full of the techie rhetoric.   I think you need to meet some new divers then. Some of the best divers in the world use sidemount, and there are plenty of truly terrible divers that use backmount. Then again- the good divers using sidemount probably aren't trying to do a wreck dive off a pitching boat in sidemount gear- they'll switch to backmount.  I dive both sidemount and backmount- and I choose the system that best fits the dive I'm planning to do. Cave or wreck on her side (with decent surface conditions)? Sidemount. Upright wreck or crappy conditions- backmount.  Anyone that tries to claim one is always better than the other is either trying to justify their own investment in that system, or they're trying to sell you something.   My single tank with backplate setup is ready for reef, blue water, light caverns, and wrecks.   If you're doing serious wreck penetrations with a single tank- just make sure you leave me your gear in your will :)"
scuba,3al8co,Smellzlikefish,-4,Mon Jun 22 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"I think you need to meet some new divers then. Some of the best divers in the world use sidemount, and there are plenty of truly terrible divers that use backmount.    One of my dive buddies is an ichthyologist that discovers new species.  Not just one or two, but at a rate of 3-14 per hour.  I also sometimes dive with one of the main photographic contributors to a major diving periodical, sometimes providing as much as 1/3 of the images per issue.  Five of my buddies are on research ships as we speak and the rest are all instructors and/or marine scientists and/or world class underwater photographers.  I feel as though I am in good company and none of them bother with sidemount.   Sidemount is not DIR   Agreed, but there is a mentality that is common to both.  Tech divers and sidemount, especially new ones, tend to defend their craft vehemently claiming that there is only one way to dive a situation the correct way.  I have felt the smarm dripping from new techies as they watched me get into the same dive as them with my ragtag gear.  It is an elitist mentality that can be a major inconvenience to others around them.  Part of my issue with many tech divers is the need to overdo every dive.  They just love to bring extra bottles, dry suits, reels, and new/exotic setups (including sidemount) on fairly benign dives.  Every piece of extra equipment slows the process down from start to finish, leaving others waiting at the trunks of their cars sweating in their wetsuits.    If I were to attempt any serious penetrations, I would spend the extra prep time, money and training on getting a rebreather instead."
scuba,3al8co,stds9tng,5,Mon Jun 22 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but there is a mentality that is common to both.   Then why rag on sidemount?   I have felt the smarm dripping from new techies as they watched me get into the same dive as them with my ragtag gear. It is an elitist mentality that can be a major inconvenience to others around them.   I could say the same thing about experienced non-tech divers.   Part of my issue with many tech divers is the need to overdo every dive. They just love to bring extra bottles, dry suits, reels, and new/exotic setups (including sidemount) on fairly benign dives.   You're right. They only should only practice with that equipment on deep dives in cold water with strong currents and significant deco obligations.  Seriously- how do you think you get good and comfortable with equipment? Diving it once in a while? Go out to a local quarry sometime and see just how many tech divers are in the water with a ton of gear- despite the fact that it's a shallow quarry with no current and decent viz. Why? Because it's a great time to practice. The same goes for the benign dives you're describing.  I have single tank setups that I use when instructing. I have sidemount rigs I'll take with me into a cave- or even just when doing a deeper dive on a Caribbean trip. I have doubles I use when doing a deep or advanced wreck dive. I won't take sidemount on a pitching boat- I don't think it works well- but I will dive more complex gear even on simple dives just for the practice (maybe I'm trying out a new piece of gear or a new configuration).   If I were to attempt any serious penetrations, I would spend the extra prep time, money and training on getting a rebreather instead.   Rebreathers are not the solution to every problem. You can't spearfish on them and a lot of wreck divers also like to spear fish. They require a lot of maintenance and careful cleaning/disinfecting after a dive. If you are going to share air then you need to bring a stage bottle inside the wreck with you and you've just enlarged your cross-section compared to a simple set of doubles. Rebreathers are very expensive- and unless you're doing a lot of trimix diving- it simply isn't worth it economically. The extra task loading of a rebreather is also a good way for a new diver to get themselves killed.  If you don't like sidemount- don't dive it. But if you think a rebreather is always the perfect choice for wreck diving- you've got a lot to learn."
scuba,3al8co,Smellzlikefish,0,Mon Jun 22 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"The question asked for my opinion on sidemount. As stated, I find it frivolous and don't care for the attitude that tends to come with it. If you want to dive it, go nuts! I really couldn't care less until you are my dive buddy who shows up with an extra 50 lbs. of gear that you don't need. Different strokes for different folks."

I say this because in the city is very expensive and the traffic is terrible and generally and I stress generally the people aren't great.   But living a little  north the prices and crowds drop.

It was good fun, but I got the impression from most of the divemasters that the diving options are limited.  Almost like I had seen the best of it.  They had a somewhat ""been there, done that"" attitude toward local diving.  When I brought up our tiger sharks, manta rays, dolphins, turtles and other megafauna, not to mention the sea freaks from our blackwater dives, they had little to compare.  Also, most of the diving was pretty shallow so you are limited.  Hawaii is expensive, sure, but not much more so than a lot of areas on the mainland.  I came here from Connecticut which is actually pretty similar in cost.  I imagine Miami, being a big city, is in the same boat."

If money is a problem, there are shores to dive, lakes to dive up north. Year round. In Miami it usually doesn't get below 75 degrees in the water during a winter. 5mm should be enough. Scuba gear is plentiful, always can buy used if money is a problem, market is large - used scuba gear - wise.  You can always get a DM cert and dive with some operations on weekends.

scuba,3aiwyk,openzeus,4,Sun Jun 21 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"Patching or cleaning without draining can be done during off hours or after hours. Draining a pool can take days and involve calls/visits to the local sewage company since draining a pool is a big strain on a system so it needs to be planned to prevent back ups from flooding the system then for filling you need to contact the water company or fire department to supply it. The fill up will cost money or take a lot of time then it needs to be properly treated before it can be opened to the public again since public pools tend to have regulations they must legally follow or face closure, that can mean several days of closure meaning possible profit loss."

scuba,3af5yl,Trooplee,9,Fri Jun 19 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"The number of divers I've seen doing entries/exits without their reg in their mouth is crazy.  They end up choking on water, coughing, then they don't want to put their reg in their mouth because they're coughing, then it just spirals downwards.  You have a device on your back that can provide you with hours of breathable air.  If you keep it in your mouth, all the water in the world can splash your face and you'll still be breathing comfortably.  For people who don't want to ""waste"" air on the surface, try keeping the reg in your mouth and breathing out of one corner of your mouth.  It's easy, and your instinct is to seal the reg and breathe through it if you get a face full of water.  Keep the reg in your mouth when exiting until you're sitting comfortably in the boat, or on dry land.  At that point it's free air.  If you run out exiting, you need to work on gas management."
scuba,3af5yl,Everywhereasign,4,Fri Jun 19 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"Hours of breathable air?   As an air hog who is lucky to get 40mins out of a tank, teach me your secret!"
scuba,3af5yl,__Slayer__,2,Fri Jun 19 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"On the surface, during exit and entry you're using very little gas per breath.  A full tank, at sea level, will last everyone at least an hour, likely more."
scuba,3af5yl,Everywhereasign,3,Sat Jun 20 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I hope a full tank at sea lasts more than an hour! If the average breath is about 500mL and an AL80 tank has about 2,300L of air that's 4,600 breaths (ish). Even rounding down to 4,000 breaths that should last at least 3 hours even if you're taking a breath every 2 seconds."
scuba,3af5yl,openzeus,2,Sat Jun 20 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing the math. I've used tanks in pools for literally days of pool dives.

scuba,3af5yl,Lucian_Gregory_,3,Fri Jun 19 21:45:31 2015 UTC,"Do you walk out with your fins on? In the states, we walk out in our booties and put the fins on once we're about belly deep in water. And if there's biggish waves, I tend to put on one fin real quick and kick out past the breakers before I put on my other fin."
scuba,3af5yl,famousmodification,2,Sat Jun 20 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if there's something convenient to hold on to such as a railing (e.g. a quarry dive) and water's calm then you can go in finless, but if you've got any surf and you can realistically walk in with fins then you do so. It saves a lot of hassle trying to get fins on in the water, which isn't too easy if you're in a drysuit and BCD. Perhaps it's easier with warm water diving. Not sure if this is bsac sop or just my experiences though."
scuba,3af5yl,Lucian_Gregory_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:30:28 2015 UTC,"ditto, I was taught to put fins on in a few feet of water, but that really makes no sense to me.  that is the time at which a diver is most vulnerable, especially if there is any sort of surf/surge.  unless it's flat calm I either put them on on land, or just jump in and kick finless until it's deep enough to have a little more freedom of movement."
scuba,3af5yl,Super_Natant,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think it's pretty easy. I did it in a drysuit and BCD this morning. You just lean back and and kind of sit into your inflated BCD, then your bring one foot up to your other knee like you were sitting and crossing your legs, and then you put on the first fin. Then you do the same with the other leg. It takes a little practice to get the hang of, but I'd say it takes me maybe 8 seconds to get them both on. People usually struggle with it a bit in the beginning, but it's what everybody does out here.  How fast does the bottom drop off for you? At the beaches I dive, it's a good 50 feet from the start of the water until you're chest deep. That's a long way to walk in fins. If your drop-off is faster, maybe that's the reason you guys walk in your fins."

scuba,3ahfv3,nigelh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:24:32 2015 UTC,Why not just run it over the other shoulder? Then when you face your buddy as you rescue him the hoses all work nicely.  If your buddy needs it you are not swimming forward but up. If they have no gas you put them on the surface as soon as possible because you have used up your emergency escape trick and the next fault kills somebody.
scuba,3ahfv3,stds9tng,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:38:37 2015 UTC,First off- not all regulators can have their hose sides swapped. I'm not certain about the R195 but if it can be done- then a service tech needs to it.  The problem is that you will now be using a non standard regulator configuration and will need to brief your buddy that much more carefully before getting in the water.  Is running out of air a common occurrence (or has it ever happened) with your buddy? Because if so- stop diving with them :)
scuba,3ahfv3,stds9tng,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"Good point about the non-standard setup. I may have wanted to optimize for the wrong case.  I've run out of air once, towards the end of a dive after the safety stop really close to the boat, the reason was a faulty pressure gauge."

scuba,3ahfv3,eanx100,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"It was about 25 bar off, I noticed that I suddenly had to actually suck on my reg to get air out, I quickly signed ""out of air"" to my buddy and surfaced. Wasn't a huge problem in this particular situation, since it basically just meant less safety margin, but I climbed on the boat pretty angry about the diveshop giving me a faulty gauge since it basically meant that I didn't have the safety margins I thought I'd have which could have been a problem in a real emergency. (It was a rental, I have since bought my own reg set, with two gauges (wireless and manual).  In hindsight, it taught me that my emergency response in this situation was exactly right, (stayed calm, communicated quickly and efficiently, surfaced without any deco or even safety stop to do left), and it didn't lead to any dangerous situation, so not a bad ""training"" at all."
scuba,3agplt,pchalla90,8,Sat Jun 20 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"Correct, the purpose of the regulator is to provide air at ambient pressure, which at the surface is 1 atm (same as you breathe through a snorkel)."
scuba,3agplt,dantarctica,6,Sat Jun 20 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"The second stage (by the mouth) reduces the pressure from the intermediate pressure (from the first stage on the tank) to ambient water pressure (such as 1 to 5 ATM depending upon depth). At the surface, ambient pressure is 1 ATM; there's nothing wrong with your thinking.   However, you're wasting the tank fill for which you paid.   And if you've got a dive partner, he's snorkeling while you're using up your air; when it's time to dive, you may be low on air so now he's got no dive partner!"
scuba,3agplt,jmancuso321,2,Sat Jun 20 02:37:29 2015 UTC,"Another: If I breathe nitrox for a while pre dive, would I have more bottom time?"
scuba,3agplt,eyal0,2,Sat Jun 20 05:59:13 2015 UTC,"Your gains would be minimal since you body starts to get saturated when the pressure is above 2 atm (depths over 10msw) with standard air (21% O2, 79% N2).  Also, you won't off gas very much breathing nitrox since nitrox only goes to about 40% before it is marked as oxygen, the max gain would be to go from a ppN2 of 0.79 to 0.60, that won't buy you a lot of extra NDL time."
scuba,3agplt,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:58:27 2015 UTC,"You could go down to 10m and have an infinite NDL, granted you would be preloaded for the dive which isn't quite addressed on dive tables..

This is all stuff that is covered in the Open Water scuba class. The only gear you should even consider buying right now are mask, fins, boots, and snorkel. Everything else can wait until you have more experience.  Picking out a mask is best done by going to your local dive shop and trying on every mask in the store (2 or 3 times if necessary) until you find the one with the best fit. Don't worry about color, or other bells and whistles. Just get a mask that fits your perfectly.  You won't be refilling the tanks after a dive- that's the job of the fill station. If you are renting tanks- just bring them back to the shop. If you are diving off a boat- just leave the tank on the boat. If you have your own tank- then take them to a fill station.

This is extra important if you are concerned about something or nervous.  Remember that anyone can call the dive off at any time, for any reason, or no reason.  It's better to scrub a dive than push on if it's risky or one of you isn't feeling well.  Buoyancy control matters a lot more than you probably realize during class.

I think I dove with Blue Planet (it sounds familiar but I cant quite remember). They were not very good at all. Instructors and divemasters just didnt seem to care and they were not passionate or interested in diving or the dive site. When they learnt I was a rescue diver, they asked me to buddy up with someone ""less"" experienced and keep an eye out and help them. WTF. That is a divemasters job!!  There was next to no nightlife around but there are a few things left over from the war which were semi-interesting. Unfortunately all the ships that are down there are not so much ""wrecks"". They are more bits of scrap metal that are laying around due to the massive explosion from mines. Nothing to really see that LOOKS like it was once a ship. Its more of a metal scrapyard.  The other dive I did ended in the middle of a donut shaped island. You swim through a cave/opening and end up inside an island which is pretty cool.   Overall though, it was average. If you feel like diving, go for it! But if you are short on time, it is not worth the time, money and effort as there are much better things to see and do in beautiful Dubrovnik"

As luck would have it, this morning I stumbled upon the cootwo project on Kickstarter, and thought you all might be interested as well.   Normally I'm a bit skeptical of Kickstarter projects, although I have backed the odd few, but this one is coming from Divenav... they make the Nitroxbuddy O2 sensor, which as far as I can tell seems to be good and well liked. It looks like they expect the new product to become available in December.  Here's a ScubaBoard thread which provides more information."

scuba,3acmnf,nigelh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Here's my perspective. I'm recently certified for Nitrox diving, and do not currently own an O2 analyzer. While it may not be strictly necessary these days, I'd feel much more comfortable having my own device (rather than borrowing an unfamiliar version from the dive shop/operator) and taking an active role in my own safety.  My understanding is that it's relatively easy for CO contamination to occur, which can be quite serious when breathing under pressure, even if fatalities are relatively uncommon. I don't personally know anyone who has been affected, but I've seen it mentioned enough times to believe that it's not an unreasonable concern.  As near as I can tell, incorrectly labeled O2 percentage and CO concentrations are by far the most common ""bad air"" cases which might potentially be encountered. S0 if I can verify both scenarios, I think I can have an extremely high degree of confidence that all's well on the air supply front.  My interest in this particular unit is simply that it will support both functions. From a purely selfish perspective, I'd prefer to avoid juggling multiple analyzers for each tank... especially when on a boat and rushed. :) This may not end up being ideal, but to the best of my knowledge it's the only dual-purpose model which is (almost) available at present."
scuba,3acmnf,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:28:05 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thank you for the replies. For the record I have my own personal (small) compressors but I can only test them for CO with Dräger tubes and it's never scored any. Out in the world I carry a trimix analyser but naturally no CO system in that. Since CO is on the list of things the compressor filters should take out I guess we're looking at places where the maintenance is 'no important'.

It was very different from Roatan where I felt like they were everywhere.   From what they told me at the dive shop, all the shops around ambergris caye have been working on it pretty extensively for a while and they've really reduced the population."
scuba,3a9wnu,jdb888,5,Thu Jun 18 12:23:21 2015 UTC,That's a good. But oddly disappointing in a way.

It is worth noting that a better spot for seeing whale sharks might actually be somewhere in the Isla Mujeres to Akumal area of Mexico, though the overall diving will be much better in Honduras.  To answer your other question: nearly any dive shop at a resort will allow you to dive with their operation, and likely even give you a discounted package for a week of diving.  I think you raise an excellent point that is often overlooked by divers. AirBnB and other similar services are becoming extremely popular among both lavish and budget travellers alike, but are almost completely overlooked by divers. I think the issue is that dive magazines and dive shops make a great deal of money by advertising for dive resorts.  I have a fair bit of experience with the sort of travel you are considering. Please don't hesitate ask any questions you might have."

We were able to find a place, but there wasn't much available, so call ahead if you are going during a busy season. We stayed in the Mame Tree Bungalows and dived (dove?) with Coconut Tree Divers. There is a ton of diving there and several outfits. Walk the street and talk to them, some are better than others.   People will accept dollars there; however, you tend to get a better deal if you transact in Lempiras. You can exchange at the bank. Remember to ask for a discounted price in lemps. I believe the price difference is due to cruise ship people spending one day on the island, only having dollars, and being willing to spend more.  Finally, try some baleadas, amazing.  You might call ahead to the dive shops and ask them to give you a heads up when they are regularly seeing whale sharks. I would be a shame to go all the way there and not see one. There are some outfits in Utila that do this as well. I understand that Utila is a slightly younger, more party oriented crowd, but I've not been there and can't confirm."

We usually don't see any whale sharks until the end of July - if any.  If you want somewhere to see a lot more marine life, Roatán is it.  There is a new bespoke dive operation here started by a good friend.  It's Quality Time Divers located in the heart of West End.  They are a 'when you want' and 'where you want' dive operation.  But, it comes at a price.  It's USD$65 w/gear and USD$60 w/gear per dive.  They do fishing on the way back, too.  Were you to catch something, they'll make ceviche or cook it up on the grille at the dock.  Most other shops are USD$35/USD$30 wo/w gear, respectively, per dive.  If bespoke diving isn't your thing, any dive shop will be great.  I've dove with them all.  They all have great staff, gear, and boats.  It's low season and you should be able to get-in anywhere.  Pop by the shops around 1230 and after 1600 and get a feel of what the atmosphere is like.  Choose one that most fits your mindset.  As for all inclusive or not, it depends on the experience you wish to have.  Do you want to feel like you're still in the states with a bit of island flavor?  Stay in West Bay or the resorts on the East End.  Keep in mind that the resorts on the East End are rather isolated.  It's a bit of a haul and hit in the wallet to get to where the 'action' is.  There are a some hotels here in the West End that have kitchenettes.  Posada Arco Iris, Posada Arco Orchedes (or something like that), Coconut Tree Cabins have kitchen/ettes available.

As for flexibility- what they're talking about is things like sequencing of skills- not what day of the week you meet and the like.

What I mean is don't become a working diver because you like diving. Become a working diver because you like travelling and diving is an excellent way to obtain a work permit in many countries. Become a working diver because you like wearing flip flops to work. Become a working diver because you like being outside. You get the idea.  You can totally make a career out of it, but you have to treat it like any other career. Present yourself proffesionally. Never pass up an opportunity for con ed. Realize that anything you do for a living will become a job, no matter how fun it is. I think having a deckhand cert could be very good in practice and on a resume.  As for hours, the standard is long days during the high season(12-15 hours) and shorter days with some days off during the low season. It can be hard work and lots of hours, but its not like you're digging ditches all day. Its all worth it in the end if you enjoy the work and the lifestyle.

I bought 3/2 for $89 (free ship, no tax) from Leisure pro recently (though, XL size). Comparable to Cressi quality wise. Not bad, for 2 years until I'll need another size or some other feature.  Even if you want to buy a European, Cressi can be had for about the same price.  Point, because you can get a new one from Leisure pro for a little more, with insurance that you can always exchange for a different size with free shipping to you, it is worth it.  Somehow I wouldn't trust that it was NEVER used. More like, looks new, doesn't smell urine.  PS: Worth checking out aqualung wetsuits. I think it is a bit pricier but a bit better put together."

scuba,3abfe8,meissner61,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"I clean boats regularly, but our harbor is probably one of the cleanest so I don't know too much about dirty water. What I do know is that hulls give off all sorts of nasty creatures and chemicals ( from the paint) when cleaning that can cause skin irritation. So make sure to cover yourself as much as possible. I would also recommend getting your standard tetanus and hepatitis shot in case you get a cut. Also avoid getting propped by making sure the keys of the captain and the engineer are accounted for. I usually ask for all the keys, put them in a bag and into my wetsuit to make sure I'm safe."
scuba,3abfe8,MarineParkRangerGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:16:04 2015 UTC,just curious how many hours do you feel you can put into it a week? It certainly feels like a work out in the beginning.
scuba,3abfe8,MarineParkRangerGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"I have cleaned 30 foot, 20 foot, and 60 foot boats and could put in about 25 hours a week at least. So 5 hours 5 days a week. I sometimes dive in the morning and drive the boat for about 4 hours, then put away equipment, clean and refill tanks, and do whatever else for another 3 hours, chill for an hour and then clean boats for 5 hours. Starting at 6am. It's a fucking workout, but everything is tight now so my best friends squeeze my but a lot."
scuba,3a9ssj,Travalicious,3,Thu Jun 18 10:47:06 2015 UTC,"How are you going to manage the equipment - do you already have your fins, mask, snorkel ? Will you rent the rest ?  Most places allow you to rent out everything if you need to; it would be a good idea to call the shop in advance and ensure they'll have the gear for you. Even better: let them know what you have, and ask them to set aside the rest for you.  Make sure you perform a buoyancy check at the surface before starting to descend on your very first dive. It's totally fine, and expected, that the divemaster do it with you, so ask early while you're on the boat and they haven't started throwing people overboard yet.  If you don't request a buoyancy check early, you may get caught in the excitement of several groups going into the water at the same time, and you may not be given the opportunity. So schedule this early with the DM. By the way there's nothing wrong for wanting to go last from the boat; this removes some of the pressure.  This should be an incredibly cool experience. Watch your breathing and your trim; keep on to the side your DM at all times. Relax and enjoy yourself !"
scuba,3a9ssj,gsoltesz,2,Thu Jun 18 11:23:19 2015 UTC,"Don't be shy. Ask questions if you're unsure of something.  Remember your training - take your time to remember your training. You don't have to rush to be anywhere! Don't get flustered getting ready on the boat, or getting down. Just be deliberate. I found this made a profound impact on how quickly I improved as a new diver, as I was really taking everything in as I went along and it gave me time to make conscious improvements to technique and decision making on subsequent dives.  If you have a camera, give it to the DM and ask him to take a few shots for/of you.  Maybe each dive focus on a skill; buoyancy, breathing and relaxation, trim, bluewater depth management during a safety stop... As examples.  I find it handy to keep a dive log. Even if I had a computer I'd still keep a log - things like weights, air in/out, dive site, things you saw or problems you had can all be referenced at a later date to help you become a better diver.  My time on the loo is over. So no more advice. Most importantly, have fun! I've got 15 dives, so barely ahead of you. These are the things I've found most useful. Enjoy your trip, mate!"
scuba,3a9ssj,fastjetjockey,2,Thu Jun 18 11:31:59 2015 UTC,"You ever been on a smaller boat before some of these chargers aren't very big.  So if you get motion sick or seasick this can make it very bad.  I found out the hard way.  Been on a ton of the big car ferries around Europe and such, nothing that small in the ocean. Got sick as hell and threw up in my reg while going down.  So look for the non-drowsy Dramamine or Bonine. And start taking it 24 hours before the dive to see how it affects you and builds up in your system. I do that now and have no problems."
scuba,3a9ssj,Nrengle,2,Thu Jun 18 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"You should bring your own mask, fins, snorkel and boots. The fins most shops rent are horribly underpowered snorkeling fins and if there is even the slightest current- you're going to be miserable. The mask should go without saying. Good mask fit is critical and will make a huge difference in your comfort and enjoyment of the dive."
scuba,3a9ssj,stds9tng,2,Thu Jun 18 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"Before I'll go and rant. My advice would be to hire a DM to go with you on your first two dives as a buddy. This will give you a peace of mind. Yeah, it might be $60 per dive extra but totally worth it. Once you'll do two dives and you'll see how things get done, you'll be ok with a regular buddy. At first, I didn't want to spend the money on my first dives but I really felt like a personal attention will lessen my fears. I was right, DMs usually are way more relaxed than their customers. By seeing that he is not afraid and has fun, I was able to relax. Plus, he was able to show me all the critters as a personal guide, which was cool. After 2 dives I felt that I can dive with a regular buddy in that same environment.  Rule #1. Once you hit the water, work hard to get the f-k away from that spot. Be it, swim into the ocean or to the rope. You don't want to be there when someone else jumps. Not often, but happens, DM's attention might be caught with opening someone's valve when someone else decides to jump out of turn while you a few feet under water.  If you are back flipping, careful not to make a u-turn under water and come up under the boat or from the other side of the boat when someone else flips. You got to aim to go down with your back, not head, then once you hit the water, use fins to propel forward while on your back.  Make sure you hold on to your mask, that your BCD is inflated!!!!!!!!! That your regulators work, test each with releasing a continues stream of air and making sure it doesn't wane, that it continues to supply. When DM will be checking your valve, make sure he did not turn it off. Very small chance, but happens.  When you jump check and recheck that there is no one below. If shit happens, set yourself in a mode to fin up to the surface. Fins will take you up even with your BCD not inflated. Use your leg power.  Before you dip, do equalization. Hold-on to your mask.  Once you dip. Check. Mask ok? Can I breath? What is my orientation to surface? Where is the boat? Do I start automatically popup or I need to give it a kick? Is all that is hanging remains there where expected? Which way is away from the boat...  Nowadays I don't put air in my BCD because I want to go down and make a 45 degree to the surface away from the boat rather than popup there where I broke the waters. However, it is more advanced. Some DMs allow a negative entry, not often but if you ask sometimes you get yes. That is where you don't have to popup. I find popping up disorienting sometimes, to much of a sudden motion up and down from being still for too long. Sure, I test my regs before and after DM checks my valve. Plus, I usually have a pony, and I control the valve on that bitch.  Yeah, when coming up onto the boat, it would seems like you got to go on ASAP. Nah, wait for the person ahead of you to fully come up on the deck. You don't want 250+ pounds meet you in the face by a tank of a person ahead of you. Bad shit may happen.  Rule #2: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, I understand it will be more like surviving for a while, or it might seem to. HOWEVER. This is important and many people get this wrong.  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT FORGET TO HAVE FUN !    <------ this is like a first priority after surviving.  Seriously, too many people are psyched to get shit right, not to die, not to fall in the eyes of the peers. People forget what they are there for. HAVE FUN.  PS: A word of caution, there might be small things that may rub you the wrong way. Some person is upset with you, something is not what you wanted, etc. However, have fun, don't succumb to noticing small things, look at the big picture. And it is all about having FUN."
scuba,3a9ssj,texasguy911,2,Thu Jun 18 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"It is important to have your own ""spot"" on the boat. Usually there are bins under the benches.  Keep all of your equipment organized in your ""spot"".  Nothing worse than a diver reaching around other divers to get at their stuff or trying to find stuff at the last second.  You should have a smallish drybag with sunscreen, water, snack, tip for the DM, logbook."

scuba,3a8fek,the_pragmaticist,2,Thu Jun 18 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"Is that a fair price or should I look elsewhere?   To put that in perspective- $350 is what shops in NYC charge just for the pool and classroom sessions- no mask fins snorkel, no books, no open water dives (real estate is obviously incredibly expensive here).  This is training that your life will depend on. While I understand a lot of people are price sensitive- your first priority should be finding a good instructor that you like and trust. You're going to learn more- and get better value from such a class than one that's less expensive- but less thorough."
scuba,3a8fek,stds9tng,2,Thu Jun 18 04:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone mentioned this!!  After working at a dive shop as an assistant instructor, I encountered so many people who were waaay too concerned about price than they were their lives.   Sure, you can cheap out on some mask, fins, snorkels, and boots, but a class that teaches you how to save your life? That's something pretty important.   My open water certifier was not a very good instructor. The first few OW dives I did I was always nervous, and not very confident in my abilities. When I got a job at the shop, still somewhat of a rookie, my old boss had me sit in an OW class and it was a world of difference.   His pool classes alone focused a lot on buoyancy control in between skills (mask clearing, regulator retrieval, etc). Almost every student that left his classes were better divers than I ever was out of my OW class.   It's fine if you're looking for a deal, but that doesn't always necessarily mean you'll be a better diver because of it. Just verify like /u/stds9tng said, but also have fun. That's what diving is all about, so don't let it stress you out too much.   :)"

I feel great about the training I received from Discover Diving. I have watched (but not interfered with) other groups that come through and see them get the same excellent level of training that I received. My class was 3 people but that was in February and it's the slow season for diving even in Florida. The class I met recently was 4 people. That is is not to say it will always be that small but I think they won't teach more than 8 at a time.

scuba,3a8fek,Trooplee,2,Thu Jun 18 21:39:22 2015 UTC,I believe that they are both PADI 5 Star rated establishments so in theory they offer the same training. The economics of the area has to be a factor.

The books alone cost the shop ~$40. By the time you pay for the pool, insurance, membership fees, equipment depreciation, and most obviously the instructor's time- how can those prices possibly work out?  What are the minimum and maximum number of students in one of those classes? How many hours does the instructor spend with the students for the class?

scuba,3a8fek,stds9tng,3,Thu Jun 18 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"and from customer loyalty.    Customers today have a lot more choices for gear- especially online retailers- and loyalty isn't what it used to be. Selling classes at cost to try to build loyalty rarely works out.  A good shop works with the students to try out the gear. They make sure they spend some time in the pool with it and if it doesn't work for the student- they exchange it for something else.  Despite the obvious benefits- we see students all the time that show up to class with gear they bought online or elsewhere. It would be one thing if these people showed up with decent gear- but we constantly see people coming to class with snorkeling fins, crappy masks that don't fit with purge valves in the nose, and these absurd snorkeling snorkels with huge valves on the top that are impossible to clear and add a ton of drag. Worse yet- half the time the gear doesn't even fit!  Either they end up needing to buy new equipment to go diving because they realize the reason they can't swim in a current is that they have tiny snorkeling fins- or they decide they hate scuba diving and get out of the sport thus wasting even more money."
scuba,3a8fek,maxwellmaxen,2,Thu Jun 18 13:14:08 2015 UTC,"i absolutely agree.  on the other hand: the shop i certified with lets me test out all the gear i want. i can just pop in and talk and get a coffee on the house. i can ask for advice and for locations where to dive.  they let you on their weekly fundives with mostly free gear rental and you just pay the fill.  i will for sure buy any gear at that spot, and will for example drop $500 this month on a case for my camera.  these guys are awesome, always correct to the customer (me), totally helpful and supportive and there is always a deal. the shop is run by the owner and a couple divers that work there a couple of hours a week, so they all don't get rich, but they love diving.  but i might be a real minority.. it's often like that with me: if i find a shop, a brand, a group that i can identify with, i'm incredibly loyal.   it's the same with my bike shop: they fucked me over twice now, they have lost me as a customer forever, and i will tell everyone."

That's the sort of shop we need more of. One of the local shops is run by some great people and while they don't offer huge deals- their return policy is absurd. If you buy a piece of gear then go diving with it and decide you don't like it- you can exchange it for something else- for a YEAR from the date of purchase.  A friend of mine bought a BCD from them that he thought he liked- dove with it for 2 months and hated it. Returned it to them with no questions asked. The put it in their rental fleet and he bought a different BCD that he loves and still dives to this day. He might have been able to save $20 or $30 on the BCD by buying it online- but he would have lost that money and lot more trying to sell it and then buying another one.   but i might be a real minority.. it's often like that with me: if i find a shop, a brand, a group that i can identify with, i'm incredibly loyal.   Same here. Back in the day my local shop provided me with an incredible education just by talking to the folks in the shop. I've used them ever since. Sadly I think we're in the minority though. The vast majority of divers are vacation divers (at least up here in NY) and few of them buy much gear at all- and even fewer seem to feel any sense of loyalty."
scuba,3a8fek,stds9tng,2,Thu Jun 18 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"this return policy is absolutely awesome!  i think diving kind of needs both: the vacation divers fund a lot of spots where it's awesome to dive, but only worth it, if a lot of people get there for it to make sense.  the others are here to form a local community, and i think both are very valuable."
scuba,3a8fek,Trooplee,2,Thu Jun 18 14:49:42 2015 UTC,this return policy is absolutely awesome!   Yep. They've been in business 30 years and no one has ever abused the policy (in NYC no less)- but it has definitely helped a lot of people find the right gear.

I'm sure they make a good amount from gear sales, I know they will try to match online prices. I know that online is hurting local business. I bought almost all of my stuff from them. I went cheap on a wetsuit, but I like it and will buy a more expensive one (5mm not 3mm that I bought) if I need it. So far I don't.  I think there is a lot of competition for business in my area and that might push the price down some. I talked about class size in a comment below. It was small also they don't have a pool so they save money on that I guess. They have been in business for a long time so it must be working out."
scuba,3a8fek,baldwadc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:49:16 2015 UTC,When a friend who is an SSI diver (instructor according to him) how much I paid he laughed and said it was too much.   I'm just curious because because I've run the numbers a bunch of times for shops large and small and without a ton of classes- I can't figure out how they can afford to stay in business at those rates.   It was small also they don't have a pool so they save money on that I guess.   So where do they do the confined water sessions? In the local spring?   They have been in business for a long time so it must be working out.    For sure- as I said- I just don't understand how :) General overhead is either a lot lower than I've seen in other shops (definitely possible in Florida) or they sell a whole lot more gear than the average shop.
scuba,3a8fek,Enemyboatspotted,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yes the Confined water class taken in a local spring. Deleon springs, it's completely enclosed by a concrete deck, the water even has to flow out through a fence to get into the spur to the river. It has a nice area that is 8 ft deep where the class work is done, then when you have to do the first ow stuff it's as deep as 20 ft and you can do whatever work you need to do in that part."

scuba,3a5s6o,macado,3,Wed Jun 17 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"Really interesting article! I'm so curious about the ""innovative solution"" now though!"
scuba,3a5s6o,Some__Bloke,2,Wed Jun 17 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"This is a fascinating story for any engineer or SCUBA diver (for different reasons) and I really enjoyed reading about it in Trapped Under the Sea. It's a sobering reminder of the challenges and realities of supplied breathing systems, particularly under time and economic constraints, but the article glosses over an important point:   After the accident, Doug McDonald, the leader of the MWRA at the time, gathered all the parties together and took the issue of money off the table, Swidey says. With some space to think creatively, a team of engineers came up with an innovative solution to get fresh, ambient air back into the tunnel, and “those plugs came right out — pop, pop, pop,” says Swidey.    I think it's important to point out that the plan they came up with in fact depended on the fact that the initial team of divers had managed to pull a few of the plugs from the end of the tunnel, and also that the second solution they came up with cost (if memory serves) an order of magnitude or so more than the original operation.  Not to say the original plan was by any means a good, safe, or defensible one - but it wasn't simply a case of ""tragedy driven creative thinking suddenly solves previously intractable problem"".  One thing that flabbergasted me is that the Canadian engineer responsible for the ultimately fatal design (Harald Grob) never faced any fines, suspensions, investigations or significant consequences for his actions. As (another) Canadian engineer, I found this disheartening as I was taught to recognise and accept responsibility for the safety risks associated with any design you create. The fact that this guy just went on his merry way continuing to design/engineer marine systems really grates me the wrong way."
scuba,3a5s6o,siberx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:36:55 2015 UTC,What was the solution they came up with to remove the rest of the plugs?  It would be really interesting to learn more about what happened since the article was vague at times.
scuba,3a5s6o,Jim3535,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"The plugs formed a secondary safety over the smaller pipes that disperse the sewage into the water from the main outflow tunnel. Those pipes had a mushroom-shaped cap on them that (assuming it didn't get ripped off by a rogue anchor) would normally prevent water from flowing back into the tunnel even without the safety plugs. This was the big original concern (pipe damage resulting in flooding) that led to the installation of the plugs and reluctance to remove them until all other equipment (and the associated workers) had been removed.  Once the divers had pulled at least one of the plugs, they were able to send a ship out to sea above where the outflow tunnel ended and lowered what amounted to a giant metal straw down and over one of the unsealed pipes. They pumped out the water, then started sucking air through their straw which drew fresh (ie: not oxygen depleted) air back into the tunnel from the treatment plant side. Once breathable atmosphere was restored, it was fairly straightforward to send a crew back in to remove the remaining plugs."

scuba,3a83td,Mr_Fitzgibbons,5,Wed Jun 17 23:39:59 2015 UTC,well the BEST is a very subjective term and can get very very expensive. If you are looking for quality video at a budget price there is not much out there better than gopro. While they are not all that great for pictures you can always just shoot video and using the gopro studio software export some frames from the video as a jpeg.   Don't do the mask mount thing as all the videos I have seen taken this was are super shaky and have a lot of bubbles from exhales. This does not really make for good video.   I like using an extendable pole (SeaLife Aquapod) as you can get close to marine life without scarring it. Also makes pretty good selfies as well.   If you go with a gopro and you are not going to have good lights make sure and get the red filter for it. this will make the video color much better. Backscatter makes a great filter that can be flipped on or off. I would suggest the backscatter flip 3.1. you can choose what filter you want with it depending on what type of dive you will be doing.
scuba,3a83td,drlucky66,2,Wed Jun 17 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"Best camera for underwater photography?  A RED EPIC-M RED DRAGON.  Don't forget your housing.  With lenses and lights, you're looking at about $125K."
scuba,3a83td,DaSilence,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:07:03 2015 UTC,"Flood it, and it will be the worst camera."
scuba,3a83td,vacccine,2,Thu Jun 18 02:36:59 2015 UTC,"If you can figure out how to flood a Gates housing, you deserve the ruined camera."
scuba,3a83td,DaSilence,2,Thu Jun 18 04:14:02 2015 UTC,There is no best. You want 'really good pictures'? Do about ten years of dive photography first. You just want pictures to email to your friends? A GoPro is quite enough. Bolt it on your mask and felt pen where it points on the glass.  The nice thing is that although stills from the footage aren't great quality you have the whole dive and you can sit at your computer and search for the decent frames. The big thing about underwater photography is 'get close' as water is never gin clear.
scuba,3a83td,nigelh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:18:51 2015 UTC,"I was talking about this with my instructor and he showed me this awesome set up he had made. DSLR (canon mkii I think) with water proof housing, custom mount, some lights, etc etc. This whole set up apparently costed him around $10k. So if you want to go the DSLR route that's about what you be looking at. There are cheaper point and shoot camera packages that could be an option but a Gopro is probably your best bet.   As far mounting the gopro goes I took it on my cert dive and had it on a chest mount and it worked fairly well. Granted I put it on video and forgot about it and there was some post processing work to get the color corrected since I didn't have a filter...   TL:DR Just use a gopro?  Cert video"
scuba,3a83td,Enemyboatspotted,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:55 2015 UTC,Much of this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYSMNPtE05Q  was shot on a GoPro.  You can take some amazing video with a GoPro- but you need good lighting and good technique. A good photographer with a crappy camera will almost always take a much better picture than a crappy photographer with a great camera.
scuba,3a83td,stds9tng,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:49:18 2015 UTC,"GoPro is alright value for money if you're interested in video only, but please don't use it for stills.  As the others have said, ""best"" has no upper limit, ideally you'd go for a top-of-the-line full-frame DSLR, put it in a Nauticam housing, and attach two high-end strobes to it. You're looking at probably 12-15k there.  Some perfectly adequate yet vastly more affordable solutions are the following:   The simplest option IMO is an Olympus Tough TG-3 or the new TG-4. They take amazing photos, and if you're really just going for a whale shark trip you wouldn't even need the housing at first because it's waterproof to about ten meters depth. You could go for former top-of-the-line compact cam such as e.g. the Canon S95 or S100, in either a Canon housing or a cheap Ikelite housing. You should be able to find an entire rig including strobe for less then $500 second-hand. It's about $730 new, e.g. here. For a more advanced, and flexible longer-lasting setup, go for a system camera such as the Olympus EPL series. A PEN E-PL1 in an Olympus housing would cost you about the same as the Canon setup, see e.g. this amazing deal on scubaboard."
scuba,3a83td,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:44:40 2015 UTC,I would say the best option would be is to buy a small compact camera along with an underwater housing for around $1000. You have the option to add strobes and lenses for roughly $1000 extra. You will definitely have awesome quality photos.  Photos from a Go-pro are pretty horrible due to the lower light levels below the surface. For videos they are pretty good considering the price. The best mount for a GoPro would be a pole as you can get closer to the subject.  If you want the best you can easily pay $15k+ for a DLSR setup.
scuba,3a83td,domby93,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"To add my 2 cents to some of the other good advice here, outside of whale sharks, are you going to be use it much?  If so, where?    For whale sharks you probably don't need a strobe, and some places might not let you use one if you tried."
scuba,3a83td,g3cko_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the other issue.  I live in Chicago, so we don't exactly have the best scuba diving in the world. I'm hoping to get into it, but the traveling would be really expensive.  Maybe I'll just rent something this time and see how it goes."
scuba,3a83td,g3cko_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"I think I would recommend the compact route, initially without a strobe for your whale shark trip and take it slowly from there.  The Olympus TG cameras might be a good start.    I started out with a canon s95/canon housing and that worked out really well for me.  I've since moved to older model dslr, but mostly because I flooded, I wouldn't say I 100% outgrew the s95."
scuba,3a80m5,spoon_merchant,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"You could buy a book.

I know PADI offers one, I don't know what fish it covers I have not taken it yet.  Hope that helps!"
scuba,3a80m5,Trooplee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"Some tips:   Buy or borrow a fish identification card, if someone has one on the boat you're diving, take a photo and refer to it later on when you've got some idle time Get a book about marine life in the area (those also make nice birthday presents for your buddies) Briefings of dive guides can be really useful, ask questions, they're usually happy to answer Talk to people who dive in the area   And then of course, you can research things on the Internet yourself, ""stingray southern california"" for example, you get the drill. Check the photos and wikipedia pages and you'll learn a lot. Also, experience will help to identify over time. You don't have to be a marine biologist for this, but some interest in the field will certainly help.  I often look up videos on youtube before dives in an area that is new to me, this primes my marine life identification, and is also a pretty good preparation before dives in general."
scuba,3a6lmb,pretyflyforanarabguy,3,Wed Jun 17 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"What was your favorite diving experience?    For me it's any time I'm in the water, but if I really had to pick one it would be seeing my wife's face after she completed her final check dive on the UNSN Vandenberg and passed her basic open water course. Knowing I have a reliable and trustworthy (if a bit inexperienced) dive buddy for life is awesome!    Is getting a license worth the money/time commitment? And would you recommend going for an advanced license or is the basic one sufficient?    The basic open water (or equivalent) is totally worth it if you enjoy diving at all. Without it any reputable place won't rent you dive gear so you're stuck blowing bubbles on the surface. As far as advanced or specialty courses go, that's up to you really. How often will you use those skills over what you learned in the basic course? More education for divers is never a bad thing but you also don't need to rush into taking advanced as soon as you finish basic. YMMV    How many countries did you scuba dive in? Best? Worst?    Personally so far I've dove in 2. Many different sites in the US and 2 reefs in Aruba. Diving in a quarry in Pennsylvania, or even a reef in the Florida Keys is so different from Aruba it would be hard to compare the two. My theory is, as long as I have a safe dive, it was a good dive.    Anything I should before starting, or after I get my certificate?    I'm going to guess you accidentally a word there and answer what I think you're asking. ""Anything I should do before starting, or after I get my certificate?""    GET A GOOD MASK! I bought a good mask when I was doing my open water course and I still have/use it to this day. That mask is 10 years old and even the original headband is still going strong!  If you're going to get your own gear, look online to try and save a few bucks but don't be afraid to pay retail either. There are few other sports where your equipment makes the difference between life and death.  Talk to as many different divers with different experiences as you can. Some people love wreck dives, some hate em. Every diver is a bit different.  Learn your dive tables. A dive computer is great, but hard knowledge of the tables and how to use/read them is better. Electronics fail, the tables don't. I keep a ""pocket sized"" no decompression table in the pocket of my BC at all times as a backup. Once you start the class, pay attention, study, and practice. If the instructor/shop has access to a pool ask to use it for more than just the minimum requirements. I just got some new gear the other day and found a local shop with a pool who let me use it for free since I was diving with them the next day. I spent about 2 hours in the pool practicing buoyancy control and re-adjusting my equipment to make myself more streamlined in the water.   I'm sure there's more but that's all I've got for now. Good luck and dive safe!"

Then decide, maybe you want to dive wrecks in North Carolina. If so you would want some additional training. If you are going to dive once a year for a couple dives on vacation, open water is OK. The more knowledge and experience you have the better for you and your dive buddy.   I have dove the US east coast and 5 different Caribbean islands. So far I am liking curacao and bonaire the best.

I had a giant pacific octopus reach out to me from within its den and grab my arm (the 8 armed handshake, if you will). It was easily the most amazing encounter I've had with wildlife, and octopuses are among my favourite animals. To be on the receiving end of their intelligence/curiosity is something I'll never forget. But also on one of my first dives ever, in Hawaii, I heard the humpback whale song with my own ears, which felt like a total blessing. Toss up between those.    Is getting a license worth the money/time commitment? And would you recommend going for an advanced license or is the basic one sufficient?     I personally think the AOW is worth it, but I also used that course to get drysuit certified, which is essentially necessary for Canadian diving. That, and night diving rocks. It's not a cheap hobby by any stretch of the imagination, but it's easily the best one I've ever taken up.    How many countries did you scuba dive in? Best? Worst?    I've only been diving in Hawaii and Canada (need to get out of the country more!), but I love diving off of northern Vancouver island. It's incredible, and the density of life in those parts is stunning. It actually looks tropical up there!    Anything I should before starting, or after I get my certificate?

scuba,3a6lmb,obdue,2,Thu Jun 18 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"As far as buying gear goes, start small and work your way up. As I said in my other post, get a good mask. When I did my basic open water course the minimum required student supplied equipment was    Mask Snorkel Fins Boots weight belt   I decided to go for good quality basic equipment right from the start and still use everything but my original snorkel on every dive. You can always rent what you need when you travel, and it means not having to pay luggage fees for your SCUBA gear. Personally, I got VERY lucky when I was in the Navy and found a guy who was getting out so was selling a bunch of gear really cheap. I ended up with 2 first stage regulators, 2 primary second stage, 2 backup/emergency second stage, 2 BCs, 3 knives, and some assorted weights for a grand total of $150. I took it all to my local shop and had it serviced, everything works great but one of the BCs is so old that if it were to have a failure it would be easier to trash it at this point.  All that being said, you can buy gear piece by piece over time. I've never seen a shop question someone who needs to rent a BC but has a regulator or whatever. Whatever you do, keep in mind that for many people who travel to dive a tank is the last thing they buy or just never buy one at all because of air travel restrictions."

All over the UK (best), Egypt, Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, others. The worst dives were some silty little quarry but it was still better than not diving.

Go as far as you feel like. Courses open up new opportunities if you feel like doing different types of dives in the future.  Some islands in close proximity to each other. The best was Anegada and the worst was... Idk, I liked all the places I've been. Curaçao, Bonaire, St.Maarten, St.Eustacius, Saba and St.Barths. They're all different.   Be sensible and aware of yourself and your equipment. If you feel uncomfortable, take a breather and then get into the water. I've gone diving when I was feeling anxious ( this was when I had done over 100 dives btw) and did not enjoy the dive at all.   Also do not touch anything underwater except if you absolutely need to. I can't stress this enough. The coral reefs where I work are constantly damaged from being touched by divers that feel like they need to hold onto something, aren't aware of their surroundings, etc."

scuba,3a6z97,MarineParkRangerGuy,5,Wed Jun 17 18:44:13 2015 UTC,I recommend this book: Vance Harlow's Oxygen Hacker's Companion
scuba,3a6z97,CanadianDiver,2,Wed Jun 17 19:00:58 2015 UTC,Don't know how I forgot to mention this.  Excellent book on O2 systems and use. Dispels a lot of the myths and makes O2 use possible for a much broader audience. Specifically useful when it comes O2 cleaning and building inexpensive O2 fill systems.

scuba,3a6z97,stds9tng,2,Thu Jun 18 23:52:24 2015 UTC,Are you cleaning the inside or outside?  Are you cleaning the tank or doing an inspection?  Do you need to O2 clean the tanks?  Do you need to replace O-rings and burst discs?  Is the tank Steel or Aluminum?  Properly cleaning tanks should be done with something like Simple Green Crystal and a tank roller with appropriate beads/bearings. They should be thoroughly rinsed with clean water and dried upside down on a special rack using clean air from a cylinder or bank. If it's a steel tank you may need to add a rust inhibitor if you can't dry the tank quickly enough.  If the tank needs to be O2 clean- then just stop and find someone trained in the appropriate procedures. The valve needs to be cleaned as well- and you need to use the right o-rings and lubricants.  Either way- if you don't know what you're doing- this can be a great way to get someone hurt or killed. Tank contamination is nothing to mess around with- especially the deeper you go.  Inspections are a different story. If you don't know what you're looking for- you can't do a proper inspection. Find an appropriate training course if possible because it will mean better and more accurate inspections.
scuba,3a6z97,macado,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Inside.  Cleaning and inspection.  No.  Yes, but I've done that since I was a kid so I'm good with that.  Aluminum.  Yeah I don't want to get hurt too bad so I'll take the proper safety steps.  Thank you for all your help!"
scuba,3a6z97,jmancuso321,2,Thu Jun 18 23:59:31 2015 UTC,Inspection really should not be done without training. Having someone show you different types of problems and failures makes a huge difference. It's much more effective than trying to learn it from a book.  Plus- without training you're opening yourself up to liability. You're certifying a tank is safe- if someone gets hurt the lawyers will hang you out to dry.
scuba,3a6z97,jmancuso321,2,Fri Jun 19 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't the advice you want to hear but I would take take a PCI-PSI inspection course if you can.   Not sure if your boss/company can pay for it.  There is a quite a bit more than popping off the valve, looking inside, slapping a sticker on it and calling it a day.  Unfortunately that is what a lot of people simply do and they can get away with it..until everything goes wrong.  I would recommend getting some inspection mirrors and rope/inspection lights in look inside. You'll want pit gauges if you inspecting steal tanks.    If you already have these things then great.  The trouble is most people don't know what they're looking for. Check the threads for cracks, folds.  Check inside tank for any contamination, hydrocarbons.   If they're steel you need to look for rust, pitting and the tanks may need to be sent out to be tumbled.  Questions..are these tanks steel or aluminum you're inspecting?  Are you cleaning or using them for oxygen/nitrox?  When were they last inspected?   Are you cleaning and inspecting the valves too?  http://www.ontariodivingschool.ca/tank%20cleaning%20&%20tumbling%20tips.pdf https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/oxygen-cleaning.htm"

scuba,3a4xpa,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 17 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Some masks like the the ScubaPro Solara have pre-made lenses available to fit them. They only come in half diopter corrections, and can't correct for astigmatism. In addition- I don't think the Solara is a very good mask. There are very few people it fits well.  Other masks like the Atomic Subframe (just an example- there are many others) have removable lenses into which you can install custom prescription lenses. Such lenses will have been set up for your IP distance, and can be made with whatever correction you want (including astigmatism)."
scuba,3a4xpa,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:15:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, this is exactly the sort of answer I was looking for. Can you please tell me what mask you find generally has the best fit? We're quite limited on our brands in South Africa, so the popular brands we do have here are: Aqualung, SCUBAPRO, Mares, Cressi, Hollis and all their sub brands. I know about the Aqualung Look 2, but it didn't fit all that well. Would you say the Atomic Subframe is your number one choice?"
scuba,3a4xpa,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 17 14:15:30 2015 UTC,Would you say the Atomic Subframe is your number one choice?   For me? Yes. It has a very high quality silicone skirt that forms well to a lot of faces. They even make it in two widths for wide and narrow faces (normal and medium fit respectively). I also love the Hollis M1 mask- but it won't take lenses.  That said- the Atomic works for me- you need to try one on for yourself and see if it fits.  The ScubaPro Scout is another good mask that accepts lenses. The silicone isn't as soft and supple as the Atomic- but it is a well designed mask that fits a lot of faces well. It's also a low volume mask so easy to clear.

scuba,3a4xpa,womper26,2,Wed Jun 17 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"I work part time at my LDS and I sell a lot of masks. You were fed a line. That company in Chicago is Scuba Optics in Rock Falls, IL. They can put lens in any mask.    The only thing that can negate a mask is a thick prescription. You want to make sure you have enough space between the glass and your eyes to account for mask squeeze. Some masks are just too close on some faces for thick lens."
scuba,3a4xpa,CanadianDiver,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:12:08 2015 UTC,"They can put lens in any mask.    They can bond lenses to single pane masks but if you ever need to replace the mask because, for example, the skirt fails- then you're sort of screwed. With replacement lenses you can just pop them out and install them in the replacement mask."

scuba,3a179u,thetafferboy,15,Tue Jun 16 12:46:40 2015 UTC,"It's probably more a problem when thinking about numbers. Much like the manta rays here in Kona, Hawaii, they have a mucous coating on their body that gets rubbed off with repetitive (or harsh) touching/scraping/grabbing/etc. So, while one person might not hurt or impact a whale shark, if EVERYone, or even just SOME people did this, it would wind up affecting their everyday life and energy involved.   Just spooking a whale shark or altering it's path by getting in the way of it, could be worse, as that animal now has to change directions, dive deeper, get out of the way, or other things that consume calories and affect its day. therefore, more feeding required, more effort used, things like that.   If we were to be the best ocean stewards possible, we would try not to affect the lives of any animals underwater, but camera flashes, scary bubbles, arm swimming, and poor buoyancy all contribute to affecting the animals."
scuba,3a179u,VMCsamsquanch,22,Tue Jun 16 20:13:22 2015 UTC,I had a chance to do this recently in Cozumel and decided not to. I think it is our duty as divers to leave the underwater world as we found it. It is one thing to observe a whale shark if for some reason it approaches you on a random dive. It is another thing to drive a boat straight to them and drop off snorkelers at 150$ a pop directly into their path. It's an egregious money grab by a culture with zero reverence for respecting nature.

It's not damaging it and it can very easily get away if it wants.  If you feel it's wrong, change my mind! :)"

I just don't think this whaleshark is going to come away from this experience traumatised.  I don't this the behaviour here causes the shark any stress, it can easily move away if it wants.  People often forget how much ""stress"" these animals are under in their own environment. Nature is brutal.  The only time I've touched marine life was to untangle a moray from fishing line.

What if the animal enjoys the contact? Are humans the only species that enjoy physical contact?   I find this ""any touching is wrong!"" Nonsense. If an animal doesn't want to be touched it will leave. If it stays then clearly you're not bother it. If it flees and you chase it then you're harassing it.

scuba,3a179u,boulderdrop,2,Tue Jun 16 16:28:30 2015 UTC,All that needs to happen is for the whale shark to decide that all these irritating humans are enough to move to a less suitable location.

It's absolutely not ok, inadvisable, not good for the animal, and a poor example, but abuse is a strong word.  There's no room for grey area or nuance in our language any more.  It's as if if you don't use the strongest possible term, your thoughts are completely neutral.  Is it wrong?  Yes.  Is it abuse?  Clearly not intentionally, and it's improbable that the animal will get sick and/or infected, but it IS a possibility.  I've been body-checked by tarpon while night diving in bonaire: they were initiating contact (I was in the way of the buffet, apparently).  I'm pretty sure they're still alive, because they do that frequently to other divers (they've habituated to divers in that area)."

scuba,3a179u,Ollava,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"Less so than you might think. Touching fishes destroys their protective mucus layers, and makes them more vulnerable to infections.

Pay in mind that this species is in enough trouble already."
scuba,3a179u,RoyalKai,3,Tue Jun 16 15:12:26 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with you that interaction can definitely be stressful I just want to point out that the actual act of touching a fish does not cause it to shed their protective mucus. STRESS causes the animal to lose its mucus and if the animal finds touching stressful then yes it will shed it's mucus, however if the animal is comfortable with human touch then just touching it will not cause it any harm."
scuba,3a179u,autotom,9,Tue Jun 16 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"I find most shark species don't mind interaction with people, and touching them mostly does absolutely no harm (please note that they have a very different skin to bony fish), especially in the case of a whale shark. The problem however comes in when other divers see images such as this one on social media, the image gives them this crazy idea that they absolutely need to touch animals to feel closer to them. I worked in Mozambqiue where we used to take people to these amazing sharks, and often the whole group would swim to the point of exhaustion to get as close as possible to they can stroke the fish. So I believe it is all a ripple effect, we should just make it clear cut, DO NOT TOUCH WILD ANIMALS!"

scuba,3a179u,Moholmarn,0,Tue Jun 16 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"One if the reasons is that the horse and cow are domestic animals, they have owners, they are looked after and most crucially they are fed. When you see a shark or a dolphin, you are seeing them in the wild, the rat race, where they have to hunt etc. Good luck trying to pet a wild elephant or a Hyena.

Does it affect cognitive ability or burn brain cells?   That was probably not nitrogen narcosis. That was almost certainly CO2 narcosis.  The vast majority of people complaining of nitrogen narcosis are actually suffering from CO2 narcosis. CO2 is 20 to 200 times more narcotic than nitrogen, and the effects can last a much longer time.

scuba,3a29ta,ZippyDan,3,Wed Jun 17 04:34:15 2015 UTC,so how do you prevent CO2 narcosis?   Prevent CO2 buildup. Avoid swimming strenuously- especially at depth. Breathe regularly (no shallow or skip breathing). Relax.   Beyond that- there isn't a whole lot you can do. Once the CO2 has built up- the narcosis is sure to follow.
scuba,3a29ta,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"Would diving with nitrox help, simply due to the higher oxygen levels?"
scuba,3a29ta,shakka877,3,Wed Jun 17 10:39:32 2015 UTC,Nope- CO2 is a result of the metabolism of Oxygen. Your body is going to metabolize X amount of oxygen depending on your workload but independent of the percentage of Oxygen in your mixture.
scuba,3a29ta,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:11:11 2015 UTC,Does nitrox reduce the chances of you getting nitrogen narcosis though?
scuba,3a29ta,Srekcalp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:23:43 2015 UTC,"Does nitrox reduce the chances of you getting nitrogen narcosis though?    Well ... It depends on who you ask :)  A lot of people have stopped referring to it as Nitrogen Narcosis and started referring to it as gas narcosis. Oxygen is theoretically 1.7 times as narcotic as Nitrogen- but for whatever reason- it just doesn't seem to affect people the way Nitrogen does. It's also possible that you simply can't get enough oxygen in the mix to become narcotic before it becomes toxic- and so people just don't notice.  If you look at the chart on the right side of this page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Nitrogen_narcosis#Causes  You can see the relative narcotic potential of various gases. CO2 is listed as 20 times more narcotic than nitrogen- but the GUE article above lists the anesthetic potential as 130 times greater:  ""The anesthetic potency of CO2 is about 130 times that of nitrogen, much greater than the ratio of lipid solubilities of CO2 and nitrogen. This suggests that CO2 produces an anesthetic effect independent of lipid solubility.""  At the end of the day- neither nitrogen nor oxygen tends to be as as bad as people make them out to be- at least compared with CO2.  I've been to 200' numerous times on air and been largely fine (slowed responses and thinking to be sure- but nowhere near as bad as some would have you believe). On the other hand- I've been to 200' on Trimix and been narc'd off my ass because of CO2 buildup when fighting a strong current.  At the end of the day- the effect on a particular person on a particular day is going to depend on a number of factors- depth, experience, mental state, cold, exertion, and so on. The biggest factor for me has generally been exertion- but for someone else it may be as simple as depth. They may just be more susceptible."
scuba,3a29ta,stds9tng,3,Thu Jun 18 04:45:02 2015 UTC,I see people going into slow motion when presented with a novel problem at 20 something meters. Over 40 meters on air and I am often too silly to dive properly. I think it depends on so many factors it's not predictable. One day your good to 45m and another you're brain dead at 30.  Narked clears as soon as you ascend. I've had this done to me on a deep water dive on a weak trimix. I got locked into a loop and I was grabbed and lifted 4 to 5 meters and it cleared. I won't dive below 30m EAD (equivalent air depth) now. I suspect your 'foggy' problem was something else.

Exertion can increase this effect as co2 is narcotic, as well.  You should not have any effects once you ascend. Foggy feeling could be due too minor inflammation of air spaces in your head due to fast or uneven equalization (or lack thereof). CO also can cause similar effects that last. I would expect any co2 issues to resolve within 12hrs."
scuba,3a29ta,CaveDiver1858,2,Tue Jun 16 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience, you can build up a ""tolerance"" in a similar fashion to alcohol. So early on a dive trip, 100 ft = ""drunk"" but 10-15 dives later, 100 ft = ""buzzed"" However nothing prevents narcosis in my experience. (I have not been diving on trimix, so I can't speak to that.)  But no matter how deep you go, nitrogen narcosis should go away as soon as you come up to a shallower depth."

scuba,3a0yu7,kickthegrind,23,Tue Jun 16 11:07:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome video! H2S Instructor (Oil and Gas Industry) here and I wanted to elaborate on this a little for those of you (divers) who may not be used to working with Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Dealing with H2S can be tricky but the divers are relatively safe from acute H2S exposure during the dive due to their breathing apparatus. That is not to say they are completely safe from exposure however...  H2S is a naturally occurring toxic gas that forms from a bacterial decomposition and is most commonly found in gaseous form. In fact, our bodies produce minor amounts of H2S everyday! In subterranean formations, H2S sublimates and easily converts from liquid to gas when agitated, mixed or decompressed. In the case of Cenote Angelita, we see a clear line of fresh and sea water that temporarily suspends H2S molecules due to the densities of the water and it's saline content. In this very special environment, we will have a mixture of different hazards such as H2S and Sulfuric Acid.  With that in mind, acute H2S exposure typically occurs when a person is exposed to H2S in gaseous form. If diving, I would recommend as little exposure to this layer as possible but they should be safe from the most harmful effects of H2S. It is important to note that people react differently to H2S. Some people experience skin irritation and will get ""itchy"" along with a minor burning sensation while others will notice very minor side effects. H2S when mixed with water creates Sulfuric Acid which is another concern all together. Needless to say, don't clear your mask near this layer! You may also experience some skin peeling after the dive if your skin is hyper sensitive to Sulfuric Acid.  In this case, I if were diving this location, I would limit my exposure to this layer as much as possible, and I would conduct a short safety stop after passing through this layer to ensure that I do not experience an adverse skin reaction. This layer will contain Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfuric Acid so it is best to get through it as soon as possible. Upon ascent, I would try to decontaminate my gear with fresh water and also attempt to get a shower or fresh water rinse as soon as possible to avoid prolonged exposure.  In all honesty, the greatest danger wouldn't be in the water per say, I would be worried about sublimating H2S on the surface and open air quality before and after the dive. This is especially true after the dive as the motion of the divers will likely agitate the water and H2S will ""break free"" and rise to the surface more quickly. H2S is heavier than air and will lay low to the ground but that can change with temperature (heat and humidity or air density) and wind. In any case, I'd try to bring a good air monitor to check the atmosphere after all divers have surfaced to ensure it falls below acceptable levels prior to removing myself from the breathing apparatus. (0 PPM > 10 PPM)  Another note, acute H2S exposure (500-700 PPM) can cause an immediate loss of consciousness and death will quickly follow if you are not (rescued) moved to clean air. Any concentration over 100 PPM will deaden your sense of smell. At levels under 100 PPM, H2S will smell sour like rotten eggs. Most people are able to work safely under 10 PPM for 8 hours but the best practice is not to be exposed to that risk at all if possible. Prolonged or chronic H2S exposure even in minor concentrations can lead to a lot of nasty chronic ailments so it's best to take every precaution to limit your exposure if you do this kind of stuff often.  I don't have all the answers but I hope some of you found this informative! Go forth, explore and dive safely!  TL:DR - H2S and Sulfuric Acid are bad, limit your exposure to these and do not take short cuts! Dive safe!"
scuba,3a0yu7,Turboxide,2,Tue Jun 16 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"OOC, can you think of any materials our equipment is made of that would react especially poorly to this stuff?

Seems like a shitty risk to take if you are going to lose your BCD functionality, or worse a first stage because a seal was eaten away."
scuba,3a0yu7,Autorotator,3,Tue Jun 16 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"Excellent question! I'm glad you brought this up because it's something that is good to know if you cave dive regularly or explore areas like Cenote Angelita. Hydrogen sulfide can eat away metals and cause hydrogen sulfide scaling. In large concentrations it can rapidly eat away at iron and steel and completely destroy the material. Not to mention, the scale itself is pyrophoric and incredibly reactive!  Most of our metallic components are specially treated (anodized) to resist mild corrosives and salinity but some untreated components can be susceptible. To my knowledge, most rubber, nylon and plastics used in dive equipment are designed/selected for mild corrosive protection and shouldn't react adversely to H2S or Sulfric Acid in low concentrations. Can those items be effected by H2S and acids, of course, but metal is our key concern.  Decontaminate your gear as soon as feasible and perform regular inspections and maintenance on critical components like you mentioned. It never hurts to let your dive shop/dive master know that your gear may have been exposed to low levels of H2S or acids if you do bring your equipment in for periodic service.  I hope this answers your questions, thanks for bringing this up!"
scuba,3a0yu7,Turboxide,2,Tue Jun 16 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"I imagine the springs and any contact surfaces that are high tolerance would be an issue.  Something where a very tiny bit of corrosion (or scale, ugh) would compromise the system should be kept out of it."

Three visits we've stayed in Grand Resort and one year we did a live aboard.  My mom and her boyfriend have been diving in Egypt for I think the last 10 years or more.  They've always used the same dive company.  I can recommend the dive company if you're interested.  The Grand Resort doesn't really have kids activities exactly.  They do have a really nice pool, kids pool and access to the sea across the street.  Last year they changed to an all inclusive resort.  We've never had any issues with the resort and I would easily recommend it to people.  My 9 year old son loves going to Egypt more than any other destination we've been to and we travel a decent amount.  Just a bit of warning.  Luxor (3+ hours from Hurghada) just had a small terrorist attack at a very touristy location.  A suicide bomber and two gun men had a firefight with some police.  Expect tourism to be impacted by this.  If you're ok with this, expect some really good deals.  The attack hasn't effected our November trip in the least and we'll still be going.  If you make it to Hurghada, go to Samos on the strip.  Awesome food, great people and ask them to show you some toothpick puzzles.  Be prepared to not be able to walk when you're done with lunch because they like to share their liquor.

Pretty much those two places for family centric, between the two even with the water park I prefer going to Sharm.  We have to fly from Cairo, so it's more expensive, but 5 hours in a car with the kids is a bit much.  Like I tell everyone coming to Egypt:  Contact your embassy.  They know what the threats are and where you should and shouldn't go.  As for the attack in Luxor recently mentioned: it was a surprise attempt at a suicide bombing, and the cops stopped it with no civilian casualties.  This after a long period of quiet.  I wouldn't worry about anything like that in the window you are visiting.  Your embassy will know if there are any protests/riots planned (yes you read that right, it's never a secret) at any locations you are travelling if you are going to leave your dive destination for some historical sightseeing.  Give it another 5 years of stability (if they can swing it) and Egypt will be fine again.  It's a long road undoing what was done under the brotherhood."
scuba,3a0q8v,Autorotator,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:32:30 2015 UTC,Day-trip dessert safaris in a landrover.   Did one out of Dahab that was amazing.   The driver would drop us off at one end of canyon and we'd hike with a guide to the other end (1-2 km) and the driver would meet us there and take us to another spot.   Gorgeous rock formations and colours.   Then for lunch we went to the driver's oasis.   There are probably also dessert tours where you don't get out and walk if you think your children wouldn't be up for a bit of trekking.  You could probably also do camel riding.   The usual deal with that is 1-2 hrs near town.   It's fun and all but can be uncomfortable so try one of these rides before you try to organize a full day ride.   Also for some reason camel rental prices have quadrupled in the last few years so it's not cheap anymore.
scuba,3a0ja0,jdb888,2,Tue Jun 16 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"The local DMs are dirt cheap to hire... Also, shore diving has been very limited. Mostly boats.   Literally every place will let you dive 1-1 with a DM with 25usd a dive.  Email first and ask about spearfishing. Best diving is in protected marine reserves, which dont allow fishing.   You can shore dive Dauin from Dumaguete, if you have a rental car. You can also shore dive APO island, but that is mostly protected reef.   Edit:   Moalboal is a shore wall dive, with self planned diving. You pay for unlimited air per day. Email shops about spear fishing. I was in Savedra, not happy about the service. I think this is your best bet.  Padre burgos is a large marine reserve.   Malapasqua you need a boat to get to the reefs, but you could be able to fish there (not protected).   Puerto Galera needs a boat, but not sure about the protection status. This is very tourist based diving, so I d think they dont allow fishing.  Alona beach needs a boat and the diving is so-so."

I dont see why the lessons tell you '' just look do not touch'' and some/many instructors ignore this rule. It even makes me doubt if there are any other rules they are breaking or maybe not even teaching. I recently had a instructor who thought it is normal to dive trough a 1 square meter cave with open water divers that panic with water in their mask....and this kind of instructors are not benefiting anyone, so I support your reporting action :)"
scuba,39w1tm,Ollava,4,Mon Jun 15 08:14:08 2015 UTC,I do not see this as a witch hunt. Instructors have a duty to be role models and should not be encouraging unsafe OR irresponsible behaviour. You have my support.

scuba,39w1tm,OneLegAtATime,-2,Tue Jun 16 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sure next, people will be posting complaints to PADI and SSI because divers are taking octopus, legally. Which did happen here in Seattle, despite the fact that the diver took an octopus legally."
scuba,39w1tm,Gutterlungz1,-15,Tue Jun 16 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"The thing is, many people like to see us (instructors) play with marine life and will tip us extra if we are able to do this and let the customers touch certain animals that we pick up. Then one out of every 100 customers makes a public outcry about it and gets an instructor blacklisted. Some diveshops encourage their instructors to play with the octopus to generate more tips. I'm definately not saying that playing with octopus is an OK thing to do, he may have stressed out the octopus a little but he didn't look like he was intentionally harming it. More of a ""hey guys, check this out"" kind of thing. Nothing worth losing your instructor cert over."
scuba,39w1tm,OneLegAtATime,14,Mon Jun 15 18:20:08 2015 UTC,"The important thing here is to realize that, as dive leaders, you are stewards of the ocean. You are in a powerful position where you can inspire people to take a stand on marine protection. People trust you as an authority that presumably knows how to handle themselves around marine life.   I'm definately not saying that playing with octopus is an OK thing to do...   Yes, you are? You also mention that you get paid more if you molest marine life in front of people. Sure, I would make more money as a male escort than as a Ph.D. student, but I decided that whoring out (whether it's my body or the local macrofauna) isn't the right way to go. Develop some baseline standards for yourself and next time, just point at something as a way of saying ""hey guys, check this out""."
scuba,39w1tm,Gutterlungz1,-6,Mon Jun 15 19:26:53 2015 UTC,I've never played with an octopus before. My friend that I worked with had his finger bitten by an octopus and required surgery and had to be out of the water for 8 months. All I'm saying is that the guy probably shouldn't lose his job over it. Almost all the people I work with love their jobs and when they do stuff like this they want to share it with other people. They may not even see it as wrong.
scuba,39w1tm,Voicy,7,Mon Jun 15 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"Isn't ""look but don't touch"" in the course materials for many of these courses? OP tried to resolve this in person and his requests for the instructor to stop were laughed off. If both of these statements are true, there is literally no excuse for this.   I guess I don't see the harm in reporting him, though. The certification agency can decide what actions they need to take, and any employee in any field should be working transparently and in a way that is defendable to whoever their employer/ cert agency is.   Good on you for not playing with an octopus.   These aren't meant to be stabs towards you, and I know that as a scientific diver in temperate/polar waters, I'm as far removed from the tropical recreational diving scene as anybody can be. Maybe it's easier for me to quickly accuse people of this because of my separation from the industry."
scuba,39w1tm,Gutterlungz1,-5,Mon Jun 15 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"It's all good. Again, I was t saying that what he did was Ok, I'm just saying that a lot of divers (tourists that visit us) actually think it's neat and like to see this, thus raising tip money (instructors don't make much money, we do it because we love it). Reporting him to SSI could really fuck him over and I don't think that's a very cool thing to do."

scuba,39w1tm,VMCsamsquanch,10,Tue Jun 16 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"The correct response to requests of that nature is to explain why it's not a good idea to harass marine life like this, not pocket the tips and shrug it off. There's a reason why you're called an instructor. It's your job to instruct, to teach. And one of those things needing teaching is the proper way to treat the very marine life we're diving to see.  Personally, I'm not one to think that light contact is necessarily harmful to the animals, but watching this video it was pretty clear that this was more than light contact.  Holding out a finger to let the octopus check you out is fine, restraining it from its repeated attempts at escape is really not."
scuba,39w1tm,Srekcalp,6,Mon Jun 15 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"This video goes way beyond just playing w/ the octopus. He kept at it til it was exhausted, plus all the energy it expended making all that ink. Plus most ocean critters have a slime coat that helps protect them from injury and infection - the way this octopus was manhandled repeatedly I doubt there's even a tiny portion of it left.    I've been in the water with octopi, even kept following them a short while and put my hand down hoping they'd crawl over it. This video is beyond the pale."
scuba,39w1tm,-hh,6,Mon Jun 15 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"Unless you (the instructor) are a marine biologist also, and qualified to read and understand these ocean animals and their biology appropriately, there should not be any touching of marine life.   Extra tips are NOT worth the destruction of the ocean. I say that, unless you are a marine biologist and KNOW what you are touching has not been negatively affected, then you should NOT be touching, regardless of money coming in.   There are certain animals in the ocean that can be touched gently and not affected (we have collector urchins here in Hawaii, for example, that are pretty hearty) - but until you understand all that biology, you should not be touching anything. Octopus ink is a very expensive deterrent for them to make, with costs them a lot of energy to hunt, feed, process and manufacture. If an octopus inks at all, that is a significant negative effect on its life."

They're also very light which is good for travel.   The high pressure one is particularly dinky.   The only downside I could see is that the braiding could chaff but I've dived in just a rash vest with them and had no issues."
scuba,39w4bv,sionnach,3,Mon Jun 15 08:08:08 2015 UTC,"I always get them, they are pricey but there is a comparable brand that is half the price on dive gear express.  You might also find that the hoses are floaty, if you decide to do a 7 feet hose and wrap it around your neck, the coil kind of doesn't lay well.  Love 'em. High pressure ones too."

I'm perfectly happy with Miflex hoses for everything except my long hose because it won't stay where I put it. It floats up, likes to twist on itself, and so on."
scuba,39w4bv,stds9tng,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"To combat this, I am on sidemount, I don't wrap the long one around my neck. I feed it directly to the mouth while the rest of the hose is coiled next to the tank with tank straps. I only unwrap the minimum length needed. This way, I feel better about the hoses as I don't have to deal with the long one. Yet, it is there and pulling out would fully expose it, if need arises."

scuba,39w4bv,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:42:45 2015 UTC,I find the 7 footers to be fine.  You just tuck the slack into your belt or around your light canister.  I imagine it would be worse with a non-long-host that bowed out into the water.
scuba,39w4bv,skoorbevad,3,Mon Jun 15 18:33:50 2015 UTC,I find their high pressure hoses too flexible and the SPG goes for a walk but I like colouring things on the LP side. Too much scuba gear is black black on black and in the dim and murkey things merge together. I carry an octo reg on my rebreather (the one for you) with a yellow face plate and a yellow hose because if you need it you are probably in a hurry. My bailouts are also coloured because if I need them I'm in a hurry too.
scuba,39w4bv,nigelh,2,Mon Jun 15 10:55:05 2015 UTC,I've been using miflex hoses for 3 or 4 years.   They're great.   There have been some issues and several recalls on high pressure miflex hoses so I only use low pressure.
scuba,39w4bv,eanx100,2,Mon Jun 15 11:49:39 2015 UTC,"They're basically just braided rubber hoses.  People fall into two camps on them, with little in between. With drysuits they can rub the neck seal and cause damage, depending on how your hoses are routed. IF doing caves/wrecks you may find they end up like toothbrushes because they don't bounce off of things. They can prevent visual inspection of the rubber on the hose and actually make things less safe.   That said, they are more durable, and can be twisted many ways and the tension is shared between the braided sleeve and the rubber. If you take care of your rubber hoses the durability issue isn't really an issue. Personally I'm in favour of anything that results in less plastic in the ocean. Shredded hose braid gets in the way of that."
scuba,39w4bv,morphinedreams,4,Mon Jun 15 07:42:01 2015 UTC,"They're basically just braided rubber hoses.   Not true. Try to lift 7 feet of rubber hose and 7 feet of Miflex hose. You'll notice that the Miflex is probably 5 times lighter. If it would be just your regular rubber hose braided, the whole thing would be less flexible and more heavy."
scuba,39w4bv,texasguy911,2,Mon Jun 15 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the better insight. I find the better flexibility a plus, as I usually find the hose on my second stage pulls the regs to the side, especially if I'm trying to look to my left."

Just for future reference, what is the ""ideal"" length?"
scuba,39w4bv,runsongas,2,Mon Jun 15 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you have your gear set up.   For example,  If you like the tank low or high that'll probably need a little bit more hose.   One thing you can try is see if you have the same problem using your octo.   For a normal recreational set up usually the octo hose is 4""/10cm longer.  It's cool that you're paying attention to things like this as a new diver."

They can curl up really tight and stow easier, and are lighter weight.  The downsides that I've noticed are that they are buoyant.  They will bow up on you as a result, so I don't recommend them if you aren't using a long host routed up your chest and around your neck to keep things trim.  This also can cause the weaving to rub on your neck.  Personally this has not bothered me, but others complain about it."

While a microphone doesn't capture the sound exactly, it does help to more wholly capture the experience, and you always have the option to mute the video, so I don't see why you would be against having the option to listen to the sound.  I agree that for videos like this the sound can often be repetitive (far different from experiencing it in real life), but it can also be useful when reviewing video of situations that turned dangerous."

I did the Roatan shark dive as mentioned ITT and there were 25 of them.  And when the food was gone, they all immediately left."
scuba,39tg4u,EatDiveFly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"the dive operators at a Roatan shark dive don't permit gopros, might be due to the flashing red light when recording/taking a picture or the beep when pressing a button."

scuba,39w65c,texasguy911,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"For scuba you have to carry on your back very heavy weight before you get in the water. Thus, the weight, around 50 pounds and up, can do damage to spine's weak points, especially if you lose footing, or something. At times the weight can be 100 pounds and up. But only on the surface, underwater you don't feel it much.  Some old folk find ways of carrying in multiple trips to the water, do a sidemount, other options. So, if you have a back problem, not the end. Just have to strategize for it and have your instructor or a dive master briefed on your condition."

Looking at the second column, it states ""Have you ever had or do you currently have back or spinal injury"". With that being a ""yes"" for you, you'll be required to get a physician's OK for you to start diving. Have a look at this medical statement, and the instructions for the physician. It's best to actually find a physician who is specialized in scuba diving related exams. Print this statement, and have your physician fill out his/her part of the form.  I'm no physician, but past back surgery is indeed a relative contraindication for diving (i.e. it depends on the case, while absolute contraindications are an immediate no-go, such as when taking certain medication, or suffering from certain diseases). If you do not suffer from any adverse effects from your back surgery, it is likely that you'll be getting the OK to start your scuba adventure."

I have mixed feelings about the whale sharks in Oslob--on one hand, they're beautiful creatures and snorkeling with them was an awesome experience.

scuba,39t53a,nigelh,4,Sun Jun 14 19:15:42 2015 UTC,The clue on HP hoses is a line of tiny bubbles forming along the length of the hose. What has happened is that the high pressure inner core has started to leak and the gas comes out of deliberate holes in the outer layers that are there to stop it blowing up like a balloon and rupturing. Remember HP hoses tend to go over your shoulders so that would be in your face.  As long as it's OK I'd just keep using it but as soon as you see the bubbles get new. The core is seeping and you don't have long. It may a while but it may be only be a few dives before it isn't micro-bubbles any more. The other thing to check on all hoses is the ends where the rubber goes into the crimp. Swelling here is a sick hose.

I usually replace them when I see bubbling come from the hose (they should be perforated throughout its length for this purpose) or at the swage. Or of course if there's any noticeable physical deformity/damage.  Actually it's the same for the low pressure hoses, but I pay closer attention to those because a failure in one of those is more catastrophic."

Yep. Sixth dive of my entire life, had my octo hose fail at the crimp and empty my tank in about a minute (LP hose failure/free-flow seems to lose you roughly 1 ft3 per second, for whatever that number is worth). I was fortunate enough to only be 20' down the descent line when it failed."

There are lots of great sites off the coast of NY and NJ- but they tend to be a little more advanced. You can do some searches or call up the local shops to see if they can recommend a boat they like.  If you just want to do some diving and get some practice- then Dutch Springs is great. It's a bit of a drive- but it's a really well run operation.  If you can't drive out there, or just don't want to, then call up one of the local shops and see if they have a charter going to Dutch. I know PanAqua Diving runs trips out there on a luxury bus. Show up at their shop, throw your gear on the bus- and they take you out there and back while you relax (or sleep)."

I have many Polish, Danish and even Canadian colleagues who consider 18 degrees to be a warm bath, but unfortunately that's a tiny portion of the diving community. Here in Cape Town we guarantee sharks on our dives (with no bait being used), we have frequent whale sightings, kelp forests that would blow anyone's mind and more wrecks than you could possibly hope for. With all this you would think we are overflowing with divers, but that's not the case, we actually have a tiny dive community. I hear the same story time in and time again, ""the water is too cold"".

It's just most likely that you'll experience it down past 100'.   It's a nitrogen exposure thing, so after a deep dive it can technical still happen. Very rare, but you can also feel partial effects, or have some other factors lead to a hit (bad fill, working hard, very long dive time/multiple dives, etc.).

Nitrogen narcosis is driven purely by partial pressure, so if you're experiencing its effects all you ever have to do is reduce ambient pressure (ascend). Rockstar is talking from his ass. If the dude is experiencing ""narcotic effects"" and not just having a good time- he probably had a toke or two before the dive.  while other gases have various narcotic effects, common tank contaminants (co2, co, etc) won't make you euphoric."

Aluminum's corrosion product with air and water is aluminum oxide, and forms a thin film pretty much instantaneously. It also blocks the metal underneath from coming into contact with the air. Iron and steel, on the other hand, form rust/iron oxide. Rust actually peels up the iron/steel, which exposes more material to be corroded.  The only reason I'd take the paint off an aluminum tank is if I thought it looked bad."

scuba,39kohz,19pedro95,3,Fri Jun 12 11:57:16 2015 UTC,"I started twinset diving with independents and moved onto manifolded. Ill try to write an unbiased pros and cons.     Independents    Pros:     Don't have to worry about perfecting shutdowns, if you have a problem you just move onto the other cylinder, nothing else to do. Cheaper to buy, cheaper to service Can swap out one cylinder easily for more gas on a 2nd dive Don't need extra cylinders if you want to dive a single, just swap configuration.   Cons:     Have a reg problem you lose half your gas Switching regs and keeping cylinders balanced If you mix your own gas its a pain Different kit config to most people, youll find very few people use them for accelerated deco, trimix etc   Manifolded    Pros:     Problems rarely mean you lose access to any gas No reg switching Pretty standardised kit config No worries about differing gas mixtures in each cylinder (Obviously depends how good you or your local shop are at mixing) Will be good for any progression of OC diving   Cons:     Expense Gas for 2nd dives Have to practice shutdowns, otherwise you are just diving 1 big cylinder. Heavy when moving them around   I started of on independents because i had access to lots of single cylinders so it was cheap. Moved onto a manifold as soon as i could afford it because i feel it offers more redundancy, provided you are competent at shutdowns. Having had a freeflow inside a wreck I was damn happy I still had access to all my gas! I am personally not a fan of slobknobs as feel it just adds an unneeded failure point.    Hopefully someone comes along to disagree, as I will have missed a lot of things!"
scuba,39kohz,scuba_platypus,2,Fri Jun 12 12:50:13 2015 UTC,You definitely want a manifold on your doubles...this allows you to shut off one of your 1st stage regs in case of failure and still use all of the air in both tanks via the second reg.
scuba,39kohz,madmosche,2,Fri Jun 12 12:50:00 2015 UTC,"I started on indies then went manifolded, you get good at reg switching and gas management. I wouldn't worry about a slob knob unless you've got back/shoulder probs."
scuba,39kohz,jonny_boy27,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:16:19 2015 UTC,Seconded. Don't use a slob knob. Those just build bad habits. Practice your valve drills and get good at them - you'll be surprised how quickly that can happen.

The connection between the LSS and sensor module is all optical and I think if everything isn't lined up just right it could give the error. Not sure, just a guess. Rebooting has always worked. You can't beat the design of the explorer either. Some may say it doesn't matter but far away better looking than the Poseidon or kiss sport rebreathers. It wouldn't take much to make the Explorer CCR. Figure out how to run 2 tanks and that's about it. You could probably even leave the LCV installed and throw in some gas addition blocks.

Check the forums as they often have units for sale. I've even seen a Prism2 go for $3500. If only I caught that in time.  Poseidon MK VI's are going for pretty cheap right now too.

scuba,39j6fa,eanx100,2,Fri Jun 12 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"The good:  The Hollis M1 is one of the best masks I've ever used.  The Hollis stainless steel backplates are as nice as Halcyon's and less expensive.  The Hollis C45 wing is pretty much the best wing I've ever used. Compact, good lift, donut wing, well made. The C60 is larger but with a lot of stages- sometimes you need the extra lift.  The Hollis SMS50 is a great travel sidemount rig- easily one of my favorites. The SMS75 is a great stage diving rig.  F1 fins are powerful, solid fins.  My Hollis LED3 backup lights have been great little workhorses.  I've tried the Prism2 a couple of times and been very happy with the performance.  The bad:  The Hollis LED25 light is terrible. Stupid design decisions abound. Mine flooded on the 5th dive I ever took it on and frankly- I've switched to a pair of SOLA Tech 600 lights instead.  Their reels are beyond awful. They essentially cloned the Light Monkey reels but used a shitty plastic that warps and just does not perform well. I had three warp before I gave them away and replaced them with Light Monkey reels.  The Meh:  Hollis regulators? Why? Apeks/Aqualung, ScubaPro, and HOG already make good regulators that are easier to get serviced or far less expensive that the Hollis regs."

My friends and I originally purchased 7 led 3s and 3 led 15s  Worse than useless.   70% failure in under 40 dives.   Under warranty replacements, once they finally arrive from Hollis horribly slow customer service, same failure rate.   Replacements for failed replacements ... same shit, different day.  Hollis customer service.   A slow, slow joke. 2-5 months to replace gear under warranty.   Know why I buy gear?  To use it, not to go almost half the year unable to use it.  Hollis marketing: tech gear?  bull fucking shit.   If I bought a $5 light at Kmart it wouldn't fail in under 40 hours.  My intova lights have hundreds of dives without failure.   Whatever lights I had before my intovas also made it a few hundred dives.   Hollis lights are badly made without any thought to quality control.  Fool me once, shame on you.   Fool me twice and you can go fuck yourself.     I'm never buying a Hollis (or by extension Oceanic) anything ever again.  I also recommend my students away from Hollis and Oceanic."

As soon as you go underwater- the o-ring compresses and the retaining ring gets loose. Mine almost spun completely out.  Had 0 issues with the LED3 though- with mine- or my buddy's.

Symptoms for thalassophobia are the same as for most specific phobias.  Thalassophobia can include fear of being in large bodies of water, fear of the vast emptiness of the sea, and fear of distance from land.[3] Thalassophobes may also be afraid of encountering sea creatures rather than the sea itself.[4][5]"

scuba,39aa9x,nigelh,2,Wed Jun 10 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"Also always maintain control of the reg, especially if it's yours."

scuba,39aa9x,eanx100,2,Thu Jun 11 11:50:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently they were buddy breathing. The one diver had an octo but it was tucked in behind his BCD straps so not accessible. The drowned diver's tank was only opened a quarter of a turn. It looks like they did the ""open the valve all the way and turn back a quarter turn"" that most OW instructors teach but the valve was already opened so the diver ended up closing the valve and only opening it a quarter turn.   http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20131222/NEWS/131229810/1040?Title=Edgewater-diver-who-drowned-at-Blue-Spring-still-had-air-in-tank&tc=ar"

scuba,39aa9x,nigelh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:00:59 2015 UTC,It's old school - bad school - but there are folks who have been around long enough that we remember the days when octo's didn't exist.  Back when I started diving we didn't have octos and we didn't have pressure gauges and a single hose regulator was a recent development. Sooner or later the gas ran out (anybody remember why we ditched the J-valve) and it was either share air to the surface or learn just how scary a  CESA actually is.

scuba,3993ld,avboden,4,Wed Jun 10 05:39:08 2015 UTC,Honest question from a newbie: can you explain why that's a problem?
scuba,3993ld,HudsonRiverLine,2,Wed Jun 10 11:29:46 2015 UTC,"We don't want them seeking human contact nor do we want to affect their behavior in any way really. This one is really young and small, should only have 3 or so divers being careful around it. It's one thing to get in front of a 50foot adult, they don't care about a thing, but the lil ones do"
scuba,3993ld,avboden,2,Wed Jun 10 15:53:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you watch the video closely, you can see that the animal is very much affected by the behavior of the divers. He is memorized by the lights and by the divers in general, it may simply be a little overwhelmed and this could set a dangerous precedent in future encounters the animal has with humans. The divers should have taken turns going in groups of 2 or 3, as you suggested"

scuba,39b5s6,CZZ23,2,Wed Jun 10 17:18:37 2015 UTC,Lots of good shops in Upper Keys. My favorite is Conch Republic Divers in Tavernier. They have two boats and they are very customer oriented.
scuba,39b5s6,jdb888,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"I second the Conch Republic endorsement.    But note a few things:  They are $5 to $10 more expensive than other shops.  They generally don't send an instructor or dive master in the water (yay! But some people like a guide)  Their boat holds 30 and they will fill it. I dove their outfit several times and they only had small groups. But the staff warned they will pack the boat if they can.     Separately, Islamadora Dive Center is a cattle  boat operation. I cannot recommend. You will see more divers and their bubbles than anything else."

Since it was just me I was paired up with a father/son where the son had some issues, I was patient (just happy to be in the water.) Eventually father/son aborted and I did some simple shallow dives with a staffer or two. Great time. Would recommend.  Also, I hope to get back down there with Silent World again as well.

scuba,39ada2,Poiah,2,Wed Jun 10 11:56:57 2015 UTC,If you're having trouble clearing your right ear- then tilt your head to the left. That will stretch the Eustachian tube on the right ride and make it easier to clear your right ear. If it was your left ear- you would tilt your head to the right.  If you can clear your ears for the first 15 feet- then you're probably waiting too long to clear your ears as you get deeper. You don't have to equalize as often the deeper you go- but you do need to do it. When this happens- go back up about 10 feet and try to equalize there. Then- if it clears- come back down and equalize more often.
scuba,39ada2,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:00:10 2015 UTC,My girlfriend had the same issue that prevented her to dive. The advice she was given was clear your air space often. Try different methods of clearing.
scuba,39ada2,The_Blue_Courier,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"Get your parents to buy you some pseudoephedrine from a local pharmacy (the real stuff behind the counter, dont get the fake stuff it just doesn't work). Get the 4-6 hour tablets as the 12 hours will keep you awake/jittery for too long. It helps open up your eustation tubes and should take care of any equalizing issues. My brother who I dive with has always had ear clearing problems and pseudophed has always helped him out.   Take a tablet a half hour before your dive and see how that works, You could take two tablets if you don't see any results. Just keep in mind its a stimulant, and can make you feel a little jittery, and this could also factor into your air consumption but its well worth it being able to pop your ears. I never leave for a dive without it."
scuba,39ada2,the-G-Man,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late here, but hopefully you'll see this anyway. I have the same problem, but if I use pseudoephedrine, will I not run the risk of a reverse squeeze going back up if the effects wear off during the dive? For me, consciously relaxing my neck muscles actually tends to help, so it's probably partly a matter of being too tense."
scuba,39ada2,Knirkefri,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:19:46 2015 UTC,"As others have said, congestion is the most likely culprit.  I have nothing to offer but the tried and tested method of equalizing before you feel the pressure building up too much.    See if there are other ways you can equalize, some can by swallowing.  I can do it just by clicking my jaw sideways a little bit.  Its really weird, divemasters sometimes freak out when they don't see my plugging my nose on descent.  But the key is to always be safe.  Do not descent too rapidly and equalize before the pressure gets bad.    I watched someone blow out their eardrum on their first open water cert. dive just because they wanted to push through it and get it over with.  And we were only in 40 feet of water."

scuba,39ada2,scallywag401,0,Thu Jun 11 05:51:52 2015 UTC,I've had issues with the same. I'm 21 and have my advanced open water. Only thing I can suggest is to try to avoid any dairy products the day or night before and to take some form of decongestant. I've gone with like 50 percent of my hearing in both ears for a good week or two after pushing it too far in mexico. Coughed up a few nice bloody boogers down there lol diving was too nice but it is really nothing to mess with. If you're uncomfortable just call the dive off. Another thing would be to just focus on equalizing almost the entire way down. I get excited when I start to see the bottom and end up descending faster than normal and that will ruin the day. Also try simple things like rising a few feet and trying to equalize again.

I wasn't personally offended by the DM, if he wants to kill his kids that's fine by me. What struck me was:   Long story short: in my professional opinion, the absolute WORST thing you can do with kids around 10 years old wrt to scuba is enroll them in a formal course. It becomes too much like school and homework. The person instructing them is NOT you and the sport, itself, becomes too rigid.   If you don't believe in formal instruction, why escalate your training to DM? But the real warning sign was: 'The person instructing them is NOT you', guy's got a text book arrogance, I bet he's never wrong.  Also, scuba as 'sport'. C'mon, really?

scuba,395g8q,OGHomey,9,Tue Jun 9 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"Octopi, obviously. :D"
scuba,395g8q,wolfgangmob,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Please report him! ASAP! There have been a lot of these incidents lately. It would suck for our entire diving community to suffer due to a few bad eggs who believe a ""fun time"" means harassing animals to near death."
scuba,395g8q,OGHomey,2,Tue Jun 9 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"Please read the post! ASAP! He has been reported, the person just feels SSI isn't going to do much without a witch hunt, come on people let's get evidence before we go all deadcoil on this guy."
scuba,395g8q,wolfgangmob,0,Wed Jun 10 00:48:34 2015 UTC,"He should be reported to the marine park authorities, I mean... what the hell is SSI going to do? Pull his DM license? That's not gonna stop the guy from diving. He's teaching students that harassing animals is okay... I'm not cool with that. There have been a lot of these videos surfacing lately of people harassing animals, not just interacting. If it were the average diver, I may overlook it and chalk it up to inexperience, but these are DM's and Instructors who are supposed to be teachers and leaders..."
scuba,395g8q,wolfgangmob,0,Wed Jun 10 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"Again, evidence, for all we know the OP just hates the guy. reddit has almost no accountability so people can start witch hunts out of no where with no evidence and we already have people ready to light the torches and fetch the pitchfork. Also, these videos aren't new, it's just like normal news, marine life harassment is just trending on here so people might go out of their way to find such a video or finally realize how bad it is and post a video they've known of for years."
scuba,395g8q,ConcernedInScythe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:01 2015 UTC,this is not a witch hunt... I have numerous times told him to not do this and he continues and even laughs about it.  When I reported him to the local SSI - it didn't even get recorded as a complaint because he is friends with the guy.  So that means he does what he wants period.
scuba,395g8q,OGHomey,0,Fri Jun 12 10:29:59 2015 UTC,"It is a witch hunt if you are not providing evidence, people are here ready to mass report him based only on your word. Your word is worthless on reddit since there is no accountability if you are lying which certainly isn't helped by the fact the only posts on your account are on this post. Give us the evidence not just ""There is a video of it guys!"" and maybe something will get done, for being so appalled you would think grabbing the video would be worth the less than 10 minutes of work."
scuba,395g8q,ConcernedInScythe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:51:53 2015 UTC,"this is the video.  I also have around 20 photos of him putting an octopus on a young boys mask, on other students, etc etc  https://vid.me/YUJo  please let me know if you cannot see the video"
scuba,395g8q,OGHomey,0,Sun Jun 14 17:38:33 2015 UTC,did you know that people eat octopuses? it kills them and all!
scuba,395g8q,ConcernedInScythe,2,Wed Jun 10 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Hunting for food is fine with me, but messing with the sealife for shits and giggles is inhumane. What's the point of inking octopuses to the point of killing them and leaving them behind vulnerable for other predators. That's messing up the circle of life... Didn't you see Lion King?"
scuba,395g8q,wolfgangmob,0,Wed Jun 10 17:47:29 2015 UTC,Yes and unlike you I don't base my morality off of Disney films.

scuba,395g8q,wolfgangmob,-18,Wed Jun 10 10:35:48 2015 UTC,"You've already reported him to SSI, so why are you asking how to report him?   If the behavior is in a protected area then the authorities may care.  If it's not in a protected area, fuck off, touching non-protected marine life isn't against the law."
scuba,395g8q,Kevinnnnn,7,Tue Jun 9 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"Why do you dive?  Edit: I looked at your previous comments, and you are piece of work. I don't expect to get a response from you since you're just a troll. For others, just because something is not endangered does not mean we get to harass it. As many here agree to various degrees, being an explorer underwater is akin to visiting another world. Leave no mark is the general consensus. I hope I never dive with you or anyone who has your mentality."
scuba,395g8q,ponyboy3,-2,Tue Jun 9 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"We probably dive for the same reason.  I don't go around harassing octopi, but it does piss me off when someone like OP gets their feelings hurt when they complain and don't get the result they want and then decide to start a witch hunt on reddit.  If you want to conserve the ocean learn buoyancy and stay off of the hard corals, quit eating commercial  seafood, quit using fertilize near the coast and other more effective strategies.  Fucking  with an octopus isn't good but it isn't the end of the world either.  Look at my comment history all you want, I'm no troll, just a person with opinion of his own.  Continue to live your mediocre hive mind existence if you wish."
scuba,395g8q,Kevinnnnn,2,Tue Jun 9 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"It is not a witch hunt unless you blame the person publicly, for example by exposing him or his personal address, or other identifying detail. By keeping that off the Internet and asking about the proper procedure OP is doing The Right Thing. It's a subtle, but very important difference."
scuba,395g8q,ponyboy3,2,Tue Jun 9 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but reddit loves a good witch hunt, the OP may not intend it to be but some redditors might make it one."
scuba,395g8q,Kevinnnnn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:52:24 2015 UTC,That is a subtle but important difference.
scuba,395g8q,ponyboy3,0,Wed Jun 10 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"Your opinion is just always the stupidest one. Nobody said that it the end of the world. However, the same people that do these kinds of things are breaking off pieces of corral, taking parts from wrecks and generally acting like its their playground. A DM should set an example, they are trusted to do so. So yes witch hunt or whatever, they should not do that period. As far as conserving the ocean, i doubt you do any of those things. Buoyancy aside. Unless you're a farmer or a fisherman. So at least do something. I volunteer my dive time to the ocean and help conduct witch hunts."

It's about two hours away, but the water really changes when you get north of Palm Beach County. There's some good beach diving closer, but conditions have to be great.

scuba,398imc,jmancuso321,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"Usually you'll complete the academic portion online and then an evening/day of pool work and then four or five dives with the instructor doing the same skills you practiced in the pool. It's a lifetime certification and definitely worth it. Not sure where you are, but it's about $200 in Florida. You could do the pool and academic portions locally and coordinate with instructors in Florida to do your dives there."
scuba,398imc,jmancuso321,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"Sweet,  I'll probably give that a shot. Might be more commitment than the SO wants though. Guess I'll just be the one splashing around in the water."

scuba,393lk0,Barking_at_the_Moon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"It was so top heavy with the concrete sculptures that once it started to list adding more water made it list even more until the center of gravity was to the port side of the center of buoyancy and over it goes.  If the barge had internal compartments it could have been made to sink more evenly but likely they were open to avoid entrapping divers.  Upside down, even with that gap it would be in danger of settling (eventually it will) and no one should penetrate it."

I've been diving for around 8 years now, since I was 12, and I have about 200 dives logged. But I have to say this was one of my favorite. The whale sharks are something else. Even the fish were some how more docile. The dive really was for the aquatic life, as there was little scenery.   However, by far the coolest part was watching everyone react to you. People thought it was the coolest thing. I was the center of attention. To the kids it was like seeing an astronaut. By far one of my favorite dives; and IMO worth the money."

Seals actually look good too, no sign of it being dry or cracking.   Is it safe to use yoke adapter on a flask that is 300 bar? I saw somewhere that they only sold adapter to flasks that had 232 bar."
scuba,394jue,runsongas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:59:53 2015 UTC,Short answer is 300 bar din valve/tank only works with 300 bar din reg

scuba,394jue,runsongas,2,Tue Jun 9 09:24:14 2015 UTC,"you can convert the reg to 300 bar din if necessary, but it might be a better value just to buy a 300 bar din first stage (you can find used first stages for 60 to 100 bucks or so which is not much more than the cost of the conversion kit)  kinda weird that the guy sold you a 300 bar din tank with yoke regs though"

scuba,394jue,mxa020,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:41:43 2015 UTC,"depending on the price of servicing the regs and how much the conversion kit is, you might be better off just selling them and buying a 300 bar din set from scubastore or another eu online retailer"
scuba,394jue,gsoltesz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:54:31 2015 UTC,"Is that tank's maximum pressure rating 300 bar or 450 bar? If the former, then the working pressure is 200 bar. Count the threads on the valve, it should have 5 turns for a 200 bar tank or 7 for a 300 bar tank (working pressure).  On a 200 bar, 5-thread DIN valve, you can use a simple insert to convert it to an INT (yoke) valve, like these. It just screws into the valve with an Allen key."
scuba,394jue,fra-zzr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"The tank valve says ""Max 232 bar"", so I guess its a 300 bar tank, with a 232 bar valve. My first stage is also 232 bar."
scuba,394jue,unauthorisedcinnamon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"Then the tank valve is going to be the 5-thread version, in which case all you need is the DIN-to-INT insert (which is cheap, a lot cheaper than a new regulator or converting your reg to DIN)."

scuba,391yhr,nickleEYE,3,Mon Jun 8 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"I did two weeks at Scuba Club Cozumel last year, had a great time.  everything was bigger there...biggest lobster I've ever seen, biggest parrot fish, etc...everything was huge.  and LOTS of it.  the water was some of the warmest I've dove in too.  The wife and I signed up for a cenote dive and it was an experience I'd highly caution anyone about.  We were assured ""there won't be a time you can't see daylight"" and that was completely untrue.  the guide led us far into passages that people not equipped for cave diving shouldn't have been in (he was).  The heliocline layer (where salt and fresh water mix) was so cloudy at one point I could barely see my wife's fins in front of me, and was just praying she was able to follow the person in front of her.  It was not a safe situation and would not recommend anyone go into it unrepared for setting expectations with the guide ahead of time."

scuba,391row,isaacandnicole,5,Mon Jun 8 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"The DM class is really only useful for those people that want to work as DiveMasters or who want to eventually become instructors.  The class itself is mostly about teaching scuba- liability, how to teach, the PADI system, etc. It's not going to make you a better diver, or otherwise improve your skills (except for your demo skills).  Working as a DM (in other words- actually going diving) will make you a better diver- but it's the diving, not the DM part, that makes you a better diver.  You're also unlikely to make any money (except maybe tips) working as a DM because the market is completely flooded with DMs.  If you really want to improve your skills then consider taking a technical dive class. It will be more challenging, you'll learn more, and you're be able to do more advanced diving (deeper, longer, whatever)."

scuba,391row,texasguy911,2,Mon Jun 8 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"It's a professional certification, it's like a license. You are putting PADI at risk if you were training people poorly and one of them died during a cert dive. Professional divers who work for salvage companies, oil companies, etc. also have to pay license costs, part of that fee is to run an organization that is ensuring you are doing your job right and are updated on new information, part is liability for using their training materials and guides with their name, and another part is it's more credible than ""Isaac and Nicole's Danish Diving Instructors"". If you think paying yearly fees for certain professions is stupid don't become a lawyer, doctor, pilot, truck driver, operator engineer, professional engineer, etc."
scuba,391row,fooda,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Not just a padi fee, you'll need insurance (another fee $400-$600 a year, I think), without one you are not a dm."

scuba,391row,avboden,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"With the instructor certification this depends on the length of time you have been out of teaching status. I believe it is an online renewal for a missed year, then a day course with course director for another year (or two) and after a certain point (~5yr) you need to redo the IDC.  Presumably there is a similar penalty scale with the DM cert."
scuba,391row,jms700,3,Tue Jun 9 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"As others have said, there is zero reason to do Dive Master unless you plan on working in the industry. As a purely recreational diver it does you no good and actually can give you more liability if something goes wrong on a dive."
scuba,391row,Barking_at_the_Moon,2,Mon Jun 8 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"just going to add something else here,  what every one else is saying is true, but there is another benfit of being a Divemaster in some cases,  Divemaster is veiwed in some countries to be a minor commercial qualification and allows you to do Scallop diving jobs which can be good quick cash if you are looking for work,  Also , with a Divemaster certification you can work as a safety diver for offshore helicopter survival courses which can be a pretty good job.  Mearsk Training in Denmark uses these divers and i believe the regulations are the same there."
scuba,391row,stds9tng,2,Mon Jun 8 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"Some good points in this thread about the perils of becoming a DM but I'm going to offer some contrarian perspectives...  As a DMC you won't be learning new dive skills but it is a good place/way to perfect the ones you have. The first step to ""demonstration quality"" skills is to absolutely master the skills that so many divers never do. The program gives candidates the supervision and the time and the opportunity to become a great diver. That's a good thing, card or no card.  Most people who have taken a Rescue course come away from it talking about it being an eye-opening experience. In many respects it really is, as it serves to broaden one's horizons from an almost exclusively internal focus to more of an external/group focus. That ability to ""see"" the bigger picture makes you a better diver and it makes diving more fun. DM is the next step on the trail from internally to externally focused: if Rescue opens your eyes to the group, DM teaches you how to function (both as leader and follower) as an effective and safe group. Plan your dive and dive your plan applies to every diver but the DM is the rung where you fully learn to see and do that in a context larger than yourself. That's a good thing, card or no card.  If hearing the phrase ""Dive Master"" makes you think ""Boat Bitch"" or ""Shop Schlepp"" then you probably never want to work as one and that's okay. That doesn't mean that you won't learn a lot on your way to becoming a DM that will make you a safer, better and happier diver. By the way, if you aren't working as a DM you don't need to worry about paying the renewal/insurance every year. Throw the card away - it's just a piece of plastic and you get to keep the knowledge and experience and skills."
scuba,391row,Barking_at_the_Moon,2,Tue Jun 9 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"The program gives candidates the supervision and the time and the opportunity to become a great diver. That's a good thing, card or no card.   It depends entirely on the program. If you're doing a 5 day zero to hero DM program- you're really not going to learn anything. If you do an internship or a longer term program- then yes- you will have an opportunity to learn a lot."
scuba,391row,stds9tng,2,Tue Jun 9 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Fair point - but anyone actually interested in developing the skills and knowledge isn't going to be interested in the puppy mills, anyway."

Sure- but even someone interested in developing the skills may not realize how different DM programs can be."
scuba,391row,nigelh,2,Tue Jun 9 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is my experience. I worked for 10 years (part time) as a Divemaster before going for instructor. Some of the best times I had in scuba were divemastering and crewing on a dive boat. You get to help new divers become good divers and that is very rewarding. The Divemaster course is good, but helping divers in the water and working on dive boats is what actually makes you a real good diver. Liability is an issue, but DM insurance is not that much. With any agency, (PADI, SSI, TDI for sure) if you want to maintain your professional standing, you will have to pay a yearly membership and complete yearly updates to stay current with standards. And you need keep your insurance up for at least couple years after DMing in case someone decides to sue after the fact.  Being instructor is a different game, as an instructor the Lion's Share of the responsibility is on you, and it is a lot more stress. The cost of insurance is higher. Other benefits of DMing (depending on your LDS) is free air-fills and discounts on gear. So you have the benefits vs the costs and decide is it right for you."

scuba,390f0e,Six_Gill_Grog,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"You know, if this doesn't exist, it totally should. I think it would be great to have something like this with lots of actual scientific facts and things like that. Also, if there was a social feature where users can report their sightings and could point out spots where they usually find certain things or their own tips on how to find let's say Nudis on Dive site X in Oman or something like that. They could add photos and compare their sightings, or maybe post a photo of something that was alien to them and have other users ID it for them, thus educating them about a new species. I think it would be really interesting on a social level but also to keep track of how healthy fish populations, reefs, etc is too."

Also, if there was a social feature where users can report their sightings and could point out spots    In many South African national parks there are whatsapp groups for this kind of thing. You can report that, say, you saw a pride of lions at bridge X, and then five minutes later a dozen other jeeps will turn up.   For diving this is a bit pointless because of how long it takes to react. Also, if you do four dives in the are, would you really want ten divers to show up at some specific rock on your second dive just to find that one elusive nudi?  I see some appeal to your idea. However, for me the most exciting thing about diving is still to learn about marine life and its behaviour myself under water, or from experienced dive buddies, and to also make my own discoveries."

scuba,38zy85,darkknights,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:17:47 2015 UTC,"Short takes. No ""scenes"" lasting more than 30 seconds unless there's something really interesting going on. Kill your darlings. Only include the very best parts even though it makes your video short. Use something like Deshaker to stabilize your video. Quite fiddly but definitely worth it, it makes your footage look 100x more professional. Color and contrast correction; boost the reds and bring down the blues/greens if you're filming in natural light. Don't go overboard and make everything pink, however."

scuba,38xkih,dora3mon,6,Sun Jun 7 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone here. AOW is a collection of ""specialty"" dives to give you more experience and improve your skills. There's no reason to wait to take the class. Peak performance buoyancy should be a part of the class, as should the deep dive, as those are both skills/experiences you need. The rest, like night dives, is just fun."
scuba,38xkih,Cvilledog,3,Sun Jun 7 19:40:38 2015 UTC,"With the PADI agency, navigation is also mandatory :)  Although OP didn't confirm which agency he's planning to do it with..."
scuba,38xkih,Fergoose,3,Sun Jun 7 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"If you're comfortable in the water and your buoyancy is good I'd say go for it. It just introduces you to some new types of diving and gives you some more tools to use when you're diving in the future. If you're going to be in a different environment (like say diving in cold water for the first time) then I'd wait for a couple of dives so you aren't preoccupied by the new gear/environment on the course, but otherwise there's not many reasons not to do it."
scuba,38xkih,citationmustang,3,Sun Jun 7 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"I agree.  There is no hard requirement for AOW except having OW.  The AOW dives are obviously instructor led.  The only thing I would add is that you should never dive beyond your comfort level.  Just because you have your AOW, don't let your friends talk you into a dive you're not comfortable with."
scuba,38xkih,DRabb1t,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, depending on the certifying agency, you may need a certain number of logged dives and some speciality courses. Not that diversifying is a bad thing, though."
scuba,38xkih,CostlierClover,2,Sun Jun 7 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"I agree.    AOW is going to move your skills along at a faster rate in my opinion if you take it seriously.    As mustang said if you feel comfortable in the water, most definitely do it.  I think I took mine after about the same as you, I felt comfortable in the water and wanted to do it because I knew I had a lot of diving coming up and didn't want to miss the good stuff.  I left a lot more competent and feeling more secure with my diving skills."
scuba,38xkih,lookitskeith,2,Sun Jun 7 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"I took aow right after ow. To me it was just felt like a longer certification. No regrets. Ow and aow should be one class as aow has good info you need to know. Also, taking rescue can be done soon too."
scuba,38xkih,texasguy911,2,Mon Jun 8 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"I did the same. PADI OW+AOW in a row, my first 9 dives. I have 20 dives now, including Wreck cert and Nitrox Computer. I wouldn't consider myself an advanced diver yet."
scuba,38xkih,soniq,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"I did my AOW after only having had three dives post certification, actually your whole situation is eerily similar!    I definitely understand why you're a little apprehensive but I had a good experience. It was a good way to get more ""supervised"" dives and practice skills. The AOW really is just variety in diving and you'll get that experience whether you do the certification or just from diving more. The good thing is that with AOW you won't be in a situation where you miss an opportunity to dive with your friends because the dive parameters are outside of OW. I would recommend doing the AOW now with your friends because it's definitely more fun with friends.    If I recall correctly, for the electives I did a boat (actually all of them were boat dives) dive, deep dive, fish ID (all of them are fish ID hopefully), and a night dive. Good luck OP, hope you have a great time!"

scuba,38yp2l,daisypushers,5,Sun Jun 7 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"Do you watch shark week? Do you notice how they seem to cover the same shark attacks every year? There's a reason for that: they don't get new material because attacks really aren't common.   Most of the sharks you will see, if you are lucky enough to see them, are small. You will most likely see reef sharks which really aren't dangerous unless you are spearing fish in their territory.   The three most dangerous, whites, bulls and tigers, you shouldn't worry about. Unless you are diving in the right habitats you will not see a great white. Tigers are pretty placid. And bulls can be aggressive but again, if you aren't actively killing fish they will likely leave you alone. The biggest bull I've seen was probably 8 feet long. I GTFOed because I had just speared a fish and he was investigating. He never made any aggressive movements.  Think of it like this. If you were walking down the street, minding your own business, and saw a washing machine walking towards you, what would you do? Probably leave it alone because, the fuck is that? It's the same with sharks. They usually want nothing to do with divers. Most shark attacks are matters of mistaken identity with swimmers or surfers or involve professional spearfishermen or abalone divers.  The first time you see a shark it will definitely get your heart racing, but chances are it will be gone before you even have a chance to point it out to your dive buddy. Sharks are truly amazing animals and if you see one you should feel lucky! If you are still worried about them, read some cool facts about them. Don't get into shark attack info unless you want to remind yourself just how rare attacks are."
scuba,38yp2l,isisis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this really does help! I always hear that they bite out of curiosity and that sucks because (1) that's kind of terrifying and (2) a curious bite could quickly turn fatal if it was in an unfortunate spot. I don't really know if that's true - that they frequently bite because they're curious - but it worries me to think about. Then again, I'm not afraid of any other fish that could kill me (i.e., Barracuda) so I don't know why sharks illicit such a fear reaction. I'm going to try to view them just as I do everything else in the ocean that I'm not afraid of - with reverence and excitement instead of fear and wariness - and hopefully the first time I see one I'll be okay. :)"
scuba,38yp2l,Diver9043,5,Mon Jun 8 02:25:00 2015 UTC,"Sharks do that ""investigatory"" bite primarily on humans who COULD be potential pray: those who are splashing in shallow water, or those on surf boards for instance. Divers don't fall under that category because sharks have no prey that really looks like a diver. With our bubbles and fins and weird profile we are utterly foreign and, as said above, most just couldn't care less that we're there. I've dove with numerous species of shark and they have truly been the highlights of every dive they're present on.

scuba,38yp2l,jdb888,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:42:26 2015 UTC,Quick question: I had to repeatedly push away a 5-foot nurse shark with the butt of my speargun a few weeks ago.  I was shooting lionfish and this shark would not leave me alone. He kept charging and I had to whack him on the nose to keep him away. This happened three times before he finally left.    Was I in any danger?  Some bro on the dive boat suggested I left the shark 'sniff' me like a dog and then it would have left me alone.  No way.
scuba,38yp2l,Diver9043,2,Mon Jun 8 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"As the guy above me said, the relevant point here was the spear fishing. So while you didn't look like prey, the smell and vibration of wounded prey was all around you. While I wouldnt think that you were in much danger, whenever you're spearfishing around large things that want to eat your catch, you're in SOME degree of danger.   Nurse sharks, as also said above, are usually fairly docile. Some people do take that too far and treat them like catfish however. They are sharks, and thus should be treated with a sufficient degree of respect."

Honestly- the crap you see on TV is so sensationalized it isn't funny. Shark attacks generally only happen for two reasons:  1) You're a surfer and they mistake you for a seal.  2) You're spear fishing, have a bleeding, injured fish flopping around on your spear, and there is a bull shark in the area.  For recreational divers- sharks are friends, not food :)"
scuba,38yp2l,texasguy911,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"And even the ones that aren't being playful are just completely uninterested in the diver   They actually are interested in the diver because sharks are very curious animals and, if not scared by you, they can go in full ""what the hell is this thing"" mode.  A shark can't generally stop moving to investigate something, so it has to keep moving and keeps circling what it is investigating. You can clearly see in the last shots (around 2:37) that all the sharks in the area are gathered circling the diver.  I personally love this behavior.  I recommend you sharks-world.com for further information and wish you all the best for your scuba experience :)"

scuba,38yp2l,EYEJ,2,Mon Jun 8 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"I do  a lot of diving in the Gulf of Mexico at the Flower Garden Banks Marine Sanctuary. In the spring, Silky sharks, Hammerheads, Sandbars, and Tigers are very common. They generally are either totally disinterested in the divers or actively avoid them. Sometimes the Silkies will come over for a look or to play with one of the float balls.   My closest encounter was  three years ago when I attached my camera to the boats camera line and went up to the ladder line to remove my fins. Reaching down and looking over, I saw an 8-10 foot hammerhead at the surface about 10 feet from me. My primary thought was ""Damn, don't have my camera!""  In the 90's I work at an aquarium, we had 3 brown sharks at the time. People were always asking ""how do you dive with the sharks?"" Various answers included ""more people get injured by hogs in Indiana every year than get attacked by sharks in the entire world"", and ""if one bites me, I am buying lotto tickets because I am practically a guaranteed winner at that point based on odds""."
scuba,38yp2l,mohavewolfpup,2,Mon Jun 8 11:38:44 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who was terrified of sharks - so much so that she was afraid to swim in the pool after I joked about the filter thing on the bottom being a secret shark trapdoor (she knew it wasn't real, but her imagination got the better of her). I took her snorkeling one day and completely forgot to mention that we might see some black tips hanging around the reef. We were following a green turtle around when we saw a 3 footer swim past. When she saw it, she didn't panic, she actually swam towards it till it swam away in a hurry. When our little shark encounter was over, I apologized for forgetting to mention that important detail, but she was glad that I didn't and glad that it happened because that encounter completely changed her view on them. It's mostly the fear of the unknown is what makes you afraid of them, I think. Swimming around on the surface, not focusing on what's in the water with you and suddenly being surprised with a shark attack is what people fear the most. My friend said that after spending a few hours in the water watching how all these other fish went about their business, the shark was just another one of them. She thought it looked like a little puppy and noticed how it kept looking at her with a ""cute"" and almost scared expression on its face, and she was amazed by how skittish they really are. Far from the killing machines she thought they would be. Sharks are actually one of her favorite fish to spot on dives nowadays!  I won't lie and say that they're all cuddly and cute. They're definitely not harmless if they're on the attack, but attacks are so rare, it amazes me that they've gotten such a bad reputation. We're killing millions of them and they kill maybe 6 a year? I did a quick google search to make sure I wasn't talking out my ass and was a little shocked by these stats: we're killing at least 100 MILLION sharks a year and they kill around 5 people a year on average. They've been around for 400 million years and we're wiping them out QUICK. If you do happen to see a shark, consider yourself lucky! They're wonderful creatures that deserve a lot of respect. We may not have them around for much longer :(  Just a little bonus: Check this out. I hope it shows you sharks in a new light! :)"

I know it's silly, but there is this element of the unknown, of not knowing what's going on underneath you.  For me, this fear completely disappears once you're down below, within the shark's element and able to move in 3D. I see a shark now, I get really excited and try to sneak up on it. I've done shark dives with a couple of dozen reef sharks including big silvertips and it was no problem at all.

For instance, I've heard several bad stories about experiences with moray eels. Never heard a shark attack story. And even the worst moray bites seemed to happen because the divers were spearing lionfish and the moray were excited/feeding. So generally you should be very safe."

Try to avoid wearing bright yellow colors as they are thought to attract more attention from sharks.  Try not to stir up too much sand and silt.  If a shark gets too close, give it a blast from your octopus.  I saw maybe 8 different sharks on that dive. They were just cruising, never got closer than a few feet. It was very intimidating to see a shark materialize out of the blue headed straight for you. But for the most part I didn't feel threatened. I would be more worried if I was doing something to attract attention like bleeding or carrying a wounded fish."

For example, you lose sight of your wife, you come up, she is not there. Against advice of your computer or amount of air, you go down and search. Such a devotion, in some respects, may have you disregard some personal safety for the safety of a loved one. Have you thought about this? I know my example might not be a great one, but you get my point. When any other diver would start considering his/her own safety, you might not, or she might not, might lead to a situation where both might perish.

scuba,38sxrg,Thjoth,7,Sat Jun 6 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"I found this in the st. Clair river in Michigan. It was stuck in the mud about 30 feet down and it was almost glowing it was so white. It's sealed with wire and cork and the bottle is full. The bottom three inches is like a white powder. There's is a small ""F"" stamped in the bottom. The ""line"" on the side of the bottle runs from the bottom to the top but can't tell if it runs through the top of it.  It's a cool find but I don't know what it is!"
scuba,38sxrg,eyal0,36,Sat Jun 6 15:30:55 2015 UTC,"If there's a vertical mold line on it, that tells you that it was made after  1800, as that's when molds started to be used to blow bottles.  If the vertical mold line continues through the lip at the top of the bottle, that means it was made on a semi- or fully-automatic bottle making machine after 1915 up to the present.  If it doesn't, look and see if the lip is very precisely rolled on or if it's uneven and has been put on by hand.  If it's the former, that places it later in the 1800-1915 window, probably 1870-1915."
scuba,38sxrg,Thjoth,14,Sat Jun 6 18:15:55 2015 UTC,This guy is why I come to the comments.
scuba,38sxrg,bigfootlive89,4,Sat Jun 6 20:18:37 2015 UTC,I have to look at a lot of broken bottles for work.  I basically just know enough to sort them into rough categories and put them into the correct century or half-century.  There are plenty of people who study glassware specifically who can narrow it down further.  The really old brown bottles tend to get a really cool rainbow sheen to them as the glass ages and very slowly oxidizes over 200 years or so.
scuba,38sxrg,bigfootlive89,3,Sat Jun 6 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if you can find a bottle expert, you can ID the bottle. Otherwise, you could find a chemistry lab that would be willing to figure out what the white powder inside is. If you are near a major university, you might be able to find someone willing to take on the job."
scuba,38sxrg,famousmodification,2,Sat Jun 6 16:56:27 2015 UTC,That's an idea! Though I'd hate to open it.
scuba,38sxrg,DoctorHandwaver,2,Sat Jun 6 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"Not opening it would hinder analysis quite a bit. You might have a shot at infrared spectroscopy, that's if the bottle is transparent to IR light, and if you can find a machine that can work with large objects, and if the substance inside is easy to identify with IR. Actually, you can make a DIY IR spectrometer, if you have the right skill set."

scuba,38uet7,flappycooter,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"a lp tank will say 3AA on the crown markings. if it is stamped 3180, then it is not a lp tank. did the hydro facility give it a +rating to get the 10 percent overfill? did you go directly to the hydro facility or through a dive shop?"
scuba,38uet7,runsongas,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:00:27 2015 UTC,"There are Faber 3AA tanks with 3180psi service pressure (3498psi with + rating), people call them medium pressure tanks. http://www.bluesteelscuba.com/cylinder-specifications.html  This sort of misunderstanding is probably what happened to the OP, dive shop and hydro facility didn't actually read the crown markings past seeing 3AA. 3AA isn't just LP tanks at 2250 psi or 2400 psi, 3AA is a broad spec that never states a pressure rating. Go look at an air storage bank used for cascade systems, you might see 3AA-6000 on the crown, those aren't LP tanks you're looking at."
scuba,38uet7,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I took it directly to the hydro facility which is highly rated, but there was a secondary employee (rather than the owner) who performed the testing. Since they under filled, the tank, should I be worried that they performed a hydro test at the incorrect pressure as well?"
scuba,38uet7,runsongas,0,Sun Jun 7 00:09:46 2015 UTC,"there is a good chance they treated it as 2400 psi tank instead of 3180. check the hydro stamp for a + rating too, you will want that so you can actually get the tank filled to 100 cf."
scuba,38uet7,runsongas,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:40:43 2015 UTC,Is that something you have to ask for?
scuba,38uet7,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"depends on the facility, doesn't hurt to double check. sometimes, tanks pass hydro but don't qualify for the +rating but it doesn't hurt to make sure that is the case."
scuba,38uet7,runsongas,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:23:56 2015 UTC,"Usually you do and it shouldn't be any extra charge, anytime you ask for a plus rating make sure they know how REE numbers work. Some places might just do the hydro pressure plus 10% which starts to damage the tank to the point it may never be + rated ever again. The quickest way to check for a good hydro facility is to ask about + rating, there are places that won't do it out of laziness others don't know what it is some do it and screw it up, if they give a bullshit excuse or charge for it just walk away."
scuba,38uet7,wolfgangmob,0,Sun Jun 7 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"hmm didn't know that the 3180 tanks were 3AA, i thought they were on faber's exemption like their fx series tanks for 3442 psi"
scuba,38uet7,wolfgangmob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:45:50 2015 UTC,If you could get a picture of the crown markings this can all be solved quickly since the marking should have all the information if you know how to read them. It sounds like you might be dealing with a hydro facility that doesn't actually read the whole neck marking all the way through and just sees 3AA and that is is a SCUBA tank and does the LP (2400/2640 psi) hydro test. You might also want to find a new dive shop if he won't correct the issue for free since if that is a Faber M100DVB tank it's only holding 75 cf at 2600 psi.  As far as an LP holding more air he's full of crap unless he is over filling those LP tanks.
scuba,38uet7,stds9tng,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"First line: FABER MADE IN ITALY M8303 01/281/186  Second line: TC-3AAM-244/00T-3AA 3180 REE77.   This is one of the morst trusted hydro testing places in south FL.  Its where the local dive shops take their tanks. They were in a rush and it was not the owner who performed the testing. Its NOT the dive shop where the guy was telling me about the HP vs LP volumes - that was just a dive shop.  If they only filled to 2600, do you think that they only hydro tested according to what a LP tank should be tested at?  Should I bring it back?"
scuba,38uet7,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"You should definitely ask, that tank should have been hydro tested to 5300 psi but 2400 psi LP tanks only get hydro tested to 4000 psi, perhaps the hydro facility did it right and the dive shop just doesn't know what they are doing when they filled it to 2600 psi. I know the local shop for me sends them for hydro and does the visual themselves then fills it."
scuba,38uet7,Badekar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:26:13 2015 UTC,I just wrote them an email. FYI the hydro facility filled to 2600 and then I was concerned and brought it to a dive shop where they topped it off to 3300
scuba,38uet7,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:14:59 2015 UTC,FYI the hydro facility filled to 2600   That does not make any sense.  Hydro facilities would not fill a LP tank to 2600 PSI- let alone a HP tank. Tanks are hydro tested to 5/3's of their working pressure so it should be considerably more than 2600 PSI no matter what type of tank it is.
scuba,38uet7,NorthWoodsDiver,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"Fill pressure =/= hydro test pressure. The hydro facility called me back and said sorry that they under filled it after testing, but said that they DID test it to the correct pressure according to the tank specs."
scuba,38uet7,NorthWoodsDiver,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"Fill pressure =/= hydro test pressure.   I understand that- which is why I do not understand why the hydro facility would have filled the tank to 2600 PSI- it serves no testing purpose to do so.  ... Unless you mean the hydro facility cleaned the tank, reinstalled the valve, and then filled the tank afterwards to 2600 PSI?  Literally none of the hydro facilities I've ever used have filled the tank for me- they don't even want a valve- just the tank. I clean it and reinstall the valve myself.  Are they a scuba store that also happens to do hydro testing? Do they O2 clean the tank? Is the air they fill it with O2 clean (i.e. compatible with partial pressure filling?) Do they service the valve and replace the burst disc?"
scuba,38uet7,SeasDiver,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"The service I got was visual inspection, hydro test, and then fill to working pressure so that youre good to go for your next dive. This all cost $41. They apologized for underfilling to 2600 and offered me a free fill :)"

scuba,38v7rd,multiballs,4,Sun Jun 7 02:50:29 2015 UTC,Snorkel first. Get comfortable in the water and breathing through apparatus. Then go for scuba.
scuba,38v7rd,jdb888,2,Sun Jun 7 03:16:13 2015 UTC,How comfortable in the water are you?  How much money do you want to spend? There's some great snorkeling in Hawaii and some great diving.   It really depends on what you guys want and are comfortable doing.
scuba,38v7rd,misplacedyank,4,Sun Jun 7 04:01:52 2015 UTC,"Scuba. Snorkeling is nothing like diving (in fact, I think it's more difficult) and if one struggles with snorkeling that doesn't mean that that person will also struggle with diving. Diving is also far more rewarding in terms of what you can see. Just keep in mind that diving is more expensive."
scuba,38v7rd,marklarledu,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"If someone struggles with snorkeling they definitely should not be diving.   To dive you must be completely comfortable and aware in the water.  You need to be able to comfortably do things like replace a mask, regulator, do a controlled emergency ascent etc.   You can't do any of those if snorkeling is difficult."
scuba,38v7rd,jdb888,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:30:04 2015 UTC,I was comfortable in the water but I just sucked at snorkelling when ever I was on holiday. The out of breath feeling was awful.   I started diving and became very relaxed in the water and now I can freedive for a good two minutes. I wouldn't have had a cat in hells chance of doing that before diving.  Lots of the older fellas I dive with are terrible at skin diving but I'd trust them with my life at 30m. It takes a certain amount of grace to be good at snorkelling/freediving.
scuba,38v7rd,murkleton,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:02:00 2015 UTC,You don't need certification to snorkel. I think anyone who puts the time in for the lessons can learn to scuba.
scuba,38v7rd,DaBombSquadYo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"It depends where you're going and what you want to see. There's plenty of places where there's a lot of pretty coral and fish only just below the surface and snorkeling is really good. The pro being that it's super cheap to do and doesn't take a lot of skill.  But then in other places the stuff you want to see is deeper and you can't really see it well from the surface. In those places it's really frustrating if you can only snorkel. In some cases free diving is another option (so diving down to see stuff while holding your breath), but that does take skill, training and practice to be any good (and for safety). If you're not good at it, then you can't really stay down long enough to see anything and you're still frustrated.  Scuba allows you to go down and see things that are too deep to see from the surface, and relax while you're down there. Obviously it costs more and there's training and practice involved, but once you know what you're doing it can be very relaxing and enjoyable to be able to get up close with the pretty things you're looking it."
scuba,38v7rd,lackin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"Start with snorkelling. Scuba is undoubtedly superior, but it's comparatively a lot of hard work to get qualified, and neither of you sound like you've been bitten by the bug yet.  Conversely, I think they do 'try dives' in Hawaii, where they'll take you down in some scuba gear."
scuba,38v7rd,Srekcalp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"My wife had no interest in getting scuba certified until we did a wreck snorkle trip in Aruba.  Then she could plainly see she was missing out being stuck on the surface when all the action was on the bottom.    I definitely recommend doing snorkling first, with the expectation it will get you interested in scuba.  What island will you be going to.  I used to live on Oahu, and just returned from a trip to the big island a couple weeks ago.  I can possibly recommend some stuff."

scuba,38uebd,stds9tng,2,Sun Jun 7 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"I had briefly looked at some of the Tusa / Sola lights, but I'm not thrilled with the build quality, and I don't really want to carry another charging apparatus with me.    The build quality on the Sola Tech 600 is absolutely top notch. I own three of them and know for a fact that Jill Heinerth uses them when cave diving and John Chatterton uses them when wreck diving.  They have adjustable levels and will run for 12 HOURS on low (which is more than bright enough).   Now that's out of the way, I had been looking at some of the DRIS (dive right in scuba) lights. The cleverly named ""1000 Lumen Dive Light"" got my attention with the description reading ""11.5 degree beam angle, and a nice spill"" getting 5 hours out of 3x C batteries.   I own 2 of these as well. You just said you don't want a light saber that's going to scare away the critters- well- the DRIS 1000 is a light saber. It's extremely bright and not adjustable.  I also own a LM canister light, a Hollis canister light, 2 Hollis LED3 backup lights, and a half dozen others. The Sola Tech 600 is, hands down, my favorite."
scuba,38uebd,hellowiththepudding,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. I had read that the Sola 600 had an 8 degree beam on it, so that was an additional strike against it. The ability to adjust the output is worth another look though."
scuba,38uebd,hellowiththepudding,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. I had read that the Sola 600 had an 8 degree beam on it, so that was an additional strike against it. The ability to adjust the output is worth another look though.   8 degree is plenty wide enough even for a night dive. For a wreck- you want a nice tight beam to penetrate a good distance and to help prevent back scatter. Incidentally- I feel like the DRIS 1000 has a tighter beam despite claiming to be 11.5 degrees.  The SOLA is not an inexpensive light- but the burn time, light weight, assortment of mounts, and sealed nature of the light make them an excellent choice for a lot of dives.  I rarely take my canister lights with me any more- even when cave diving- I'd keep a pair of SOLAs with me. Two Tech 600's cost about the same amount as a single LM canister light, the burn time is excellent, and I get some redundancy. If one fails I don't have to fail over to one of my lower power backup lights.  Having said all that- it's a light. The DRIS 1000 is a great light- but you're not mounting one on the back of your hand for hands free operation- it's just too long. Depending on how often you dive the batteries can get pricey too. The SOLA Tech 600 is an expensive light- but I don't know anyone that's used one that doesn't love it.  Here is John Chatterton's take on the Tech 600:  http://www.johnchatterton.com/dive-locker/primary-light/"

scuba,38qa6i,MassiveBeatdown,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:08:26 2015 UTC,One of the older guys at the dive school told me a story about a tank getting a crack in the cylinder. Back before BCDs were used & some of the poorer countries had proper dive centres with good gear. Apparently an old tank that had not been pressure tested was filled & put on a boat for a dive. Everyone goes out on the boat. As they get ready this tank get knocked or falls over and the hairline crack gives way. A blade of pressurised air cuts a guys leg off at the shin. Or at least most of the way through.  Make sure the tank you use has been tested. After all you are relying on this potential bomb to keep you alive for the next 45 mins.

Tanks don't spontaneously rupture just sitting there untouched in a fairly decent storage environment with current hydro stamps. Also, it is a good idea to store them somewhere no one will knock them over like in a closet, ruptures are rare but broken toes are a good deal more common."
scuba,38qa6i,McFeely_Smackup,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:40:52 2015 UTC,damn...I haven't seen a J valve on a SCUBA tank in like 20 years.
scuba,38qa6i,nigelh,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:24:36 2015 UTC,That is a remarkably contrived test. If you know just where to hit it you can create an 'accident' that has never happened. The problem with tanks is a failure when you fill them. Then they burst and will make that 'incident' look trivial. A tank blowing on filling can take the roof off and paint the operator all over the wall.  The energy stored in a full tank is comparable with that in a hand grenade.
scuba,38qa6i,wolfgangmob,2,Sat Jun 6 07:49:55 2015 UTC,"Accidents like this have happened, drop a tank on the valve and it can become a rocket or rupture. Filling failures are almost always a matter of neglect creating an overfill with the exception of the handful of AL 6351 failures but that is literally a single digit number of deaths in the US.   As far as it painting the operator all over the wall I question that statement heavily. A tank failing isn't at all like an explosive going off since a tank ""exploding"" actually isn't an explosion at all. If a tank ruptures in the same room as you you will live if none of the shrapnel kills you, there are a few operators who have survived an 6351 AL tank failure and suffered no pressure wave trauma but did lose limbs from tank shrapnel. If a hand grenade goes off near you the pressure wave alone is lethal. Similar amounts of energy but two very different events."

scuba,38qa6i,wolfgangmob,2,Sat Jun 6 06:05:03 2015 UTC,"Acetylene shouldn't be very high of pressure, less than 400 psi actually, and oxygen is probably only around 2250 psi if you read the tank markings, also the oxy tank would risk exploding from the friction of flowing out of the tank. European scuba tanks come in steel 4350 psi varieties that are very rare in the US, if you want to send a tank through a concrete wall you need an air storage tank like gets used for a cascade system that are 5000 or 6000 psi hold hundreds of cu ft of air and can weigh 100 pounds or more easily."

If you are using a light- now you're tinting everything red.  As for color correcting masks-  First off- they're a filter- which means they block some light. I want all the available light to reach my eyes- not get stopped by the lens.  Masks lenses often take a beating on boats and in our gear bags. Unless the color correction is laminated inside the lens- it will be prone to damage. A scratched coating is incredibly distracting.  Moreover- the most important thing is that the mask fits. Worry about that first- then worry about whether or not they offer some sort of ""color correction"".  In short- I've never found them to be particularly useful.

scuba,38r6u0,nigelh,4,Sat Jun 6 19:14:02 2015 UTC,Nooo....  Colour correction works by screening out most of everything that isn't red to reduce them to the tiny amount of red that gets into the sea. A colour corrected mask would be like diving in a welding helmet. Cameras just wind up the ISO and aperture to compensate but I think the results are always poor. Without the filter the camera takes what you see which is blue coloured (or green where I live).  I you want true colour use a strobe for stills and a light tray for video.

scuba,38ox41,wolfgangmob,3,Sat Jun 6 09:57:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe he dives using an air storage tank that holds around 500 cu ft with a highly custom regulator   I know you're joking but it actually doesn't matter. Even saturation diving to 10m will not require decompression on the way to the surface. 10m results in a pressure twice that at the surface. The pN2 is thus 1.58.  1.58 is the maximum supersaturation that Haldane/Workman acknowledge could be tolerated by the human body (2 was Haldane considering the total mixture, 1.58 is Workman considering only the Nitrogen).  See:  http://www.diverite.com/education/rebreather/tips/gradient%20factors/  Specifically these sections:  ""Haldane is considered to be the father of modern decompression theory. In his research, he made an important conclusion that a diver could surface from an indefinitely long 10m/33ft dive without DCS. From this result, he determined that human body could tolerate pressure change with a factor of 2:1 (the pressure in 10m/33ft is 2 ATA, while on surface it is 1 ATA). Later this number was refined to be 1.58:1 by Robert Workman.""  and:  ""Back to the history: Robert Workman introduced the term M-value, which means Maximum inert gas pressure in a hypothetical tissue compartment which it can tolerate without DCS. As mentioned, Haldane found out in his research that M-value is 2, and Workman refined it to be 1.58 (this number comes from pressure change from 2 ATA to 1 ATA, and taking into account that air has 79% inert gases, mainly nitrogen)."""

scuba,38ox41,Srekcalp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:37:09 2015 UTC,How come the divers couldn't just rush the 10m of desaturation?   Well- because 10m is the limit for the ratio- not 12 :)  But mostly it's because while while they had just reached a chamber pressure of 35 feet- they still had a 2:1 supersaturation in their body for that depth.  In other words- 35 feet was the shallowest they could go and still maintain that 2:1 ratio. If they surfaced- the outside pressure would have halved and the supersaturation ratio would have been 4:1 and they would have gotten bent- and pretty badly.  If they had remained in the chamber for a while and achieved balance at 30 feet then yes- they could have surfaced without ill effect.
scuba,38ox41,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"I know the safety stop isn't required, but I consider every lake dive (our lake is only 10m) a training dive.

If you want your computer to also tell you how much air is in your tank, you'll pay a little more (and potentially have to also buy the $200-$400 transmitter).  Also, consider that, at some point, you'll want to have a backup computer. So, if you happen to purchase a less-featured computer now, it'll serve you as a backup later when you get a more complicated computer. So don't do what I did: stress out for months trying to find the ""perfect"" computer that is going to suit you for all eternity.  My advice is just get something that doesn't break the bank, and upgrade later when/if you 1) get into more technical diving or 2) really need to.  Further advice specific to computers:   Make sure you get a nitrox capable computer (though, this is sort of a given, I don't think you can even buy a non-nitrox computer these days??). If you choose to go the console route, make sure you get a computer with a quick-disconnect.  Having to un-thread your console is a pita when you want to pop your computer off and go fill out logbooks over lunch. Pay attention to warranties.  Some dive computers have a lifetime warranty if you have them serviced on schedule. For air integrated computers, pay attention to whether or not they come with a transmitter.  This can be another $200-$400 depending on brand. Don't stress out over algorithm restrictions (ie. oceanic vs. suunto holy war..).  Yes, some computers will be more liberal or conservative than others.  Some computers will limit either the first, or subsequent dives.  Most computers are somewhat ""tunable"" and the difference really doesn't make a huge difference in the beginning anyway. You'll pay a little more for dive computers that can double as an everyday watch.  Though, there's something to be said for a big large display.  My oceanic VT4 is almost feature compatible with the OCi, except for it costs about 1/2 as much, not in a titanium case, can't be worn as an everyday watch, and has a much larger display.  So that's something to think about... Lots of people have suunto d4/6, oceanic geo's, suunto gekko/zoops, cressi leonardos, oceanic oc1/i.  Find someone who has the computer you are interested in and ask them how they like it."
scuba,38ox41,solid7,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, since you were looking for individual recommendations:  oceanic geo, cressio leo, suunto zoop are good less-featured computers.  None of them are air-integrated and you'll probably pay around $250-300ish depending on where you pick them up."

scuba,38m1k3,Dalarast,3,Fri Jun 5 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"GI benefits only apply to professional ranks, not OW and other sub-DM level training. It's a big hassle for the shop to qualify as a school for the purpose of benefits and that means that they have to be training a lot of instructors for it to be worth their while. Most shops simply can't justify the time and money required to deal with it.  You can, however, look for qualified schools on this locator. Plug in something like 'scuba' for the school name and set it to look for any kind of institution, then pick a state or protectorate. Then try again using 'dive' and 'diving' and whatever other key words you think might appear in the name of a school. It's onerous but you'll find some hits.  Or you might try contacting the training department at PADI and some of the other agencies and asking them if they have any suggestions."
scuba,38m1k3,Barking_at_the_Moon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'd like to sort of reiterate what you said and stress that the types of places that produce enough instructors and seek to accept military benefits are often thusly oriented.  That is to say they tend to be the more business-oriented dive shops where the focus is on getting people In and out.  Of course there are standards from the dive agencies that these shops are required to follow, and in my experience most shops play pretty close to the rules.  If OP is interested in becoming an instructor because it's something you enjoy, then I'd say go for it dude!  Especially if you already have real school out of the way.    Td;dr imho big shops are good for IDCs if you already have experience and solid skills"
scuba,38m1k3,Ernest_Retard_Ringo,3,Fri Jun 5 09:50:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain that your interpretation of their focus is universally or intrinsically correct - sometimes people and businesses succeed for exactly the opposite reason: they actually take a more customer-centric view and dedicate themselves to providing the best service they can.  In my experience (PADI IDC Staff Instructor, SDI/TDI Instructor Trainer) the bigger organizations can actually offer students more, especially instructor candidates, simply because they have more going on. More opportunities to learn and to practice and to train and that makes for better instructors in the long run. The little shops often have passion but that usually isn't enough to make up for the limited and semipro environment they proffer.  The folks that sign up for instructor training without having previously nailed the skills and knowledge are the bane of the sport...well, that speaks as poorly of them as it does the operator that snookered their money. There's nothing wrong with spending another year working as a DM to give yourself a chance to truly master the fundamentals you want to teach others. Indeed, it's often a good idea and if you aren't willing to put the time and effort in as a DM before advancing into teaching you shouldn't."
scuba,38m1k3,Barking_at_the_Moon,2,Fri Jun 5 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't mean to imply that's what you meant.  I was just using generalizations in order to avoid giving specifics about my situation, but as you pointed out making sweeping assumptions doesn't always work.  Some dive shops may be better choices than others, but of course at the end of the day what matters is the divers are safe, learned something, and maybe even had some fun.  However, some of these shops run such condensed programs that the candidates have barely enough time to get the required number of dives, never mind getting enough experience to really feel comfortable and/or work with real students in a ""controlled"" setting.  But just as always I thinks it's a good idea to meet and get a feel for the instructor(s) before you make a huge commitment.    Source: did my IDC at such a place.  Heard the complaints of my 0-to-hero classmates."
scuba,38m1k3,Ernest_Retard_Ringo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"In my experience (PADI IDC Staff Instructor, SDI/TDI Instructor Trainer) the bigger organizations can actually offer students more, especially instructor candidates, simply because they have more going on.   Up to a point- sure- but at some point it's just too big.  As for the quality of instructors being turned out- I've given up there. I'm also an IDC Staff Instructor and the recently minted instructors I saw were, frankly, awful. I don't mean awful instructors- I mean awful divers!  It was a large group (16 new instructors) and I'd only dive with 2 of them. You had instructors vertical in the water, kicking to stay in place instead of getting neutral. Except for the two I mentioned- all of the rest had trim problems of one sort or another.  I watched them try to shoot an DSMB and it would be funny if it wasn't so scary. You had people trying to shoot a sealed SMB with no OPV from depth. You had others trying to use an LPI hose to inflate an SMB with an oral inflation valve. Several people dropped reels, the SMB, or both. A couple got their reels so tangled they literally could not shoot the SMB at all.  One of these instructors managed to almost run out of air on a dive. It was a 90 foot dive and I surfaced with 2k PSI after getting close enough to my NDL. They came up with 250 PSI.  How these folks are going to be able to take care of their students when they can barely take care of themselves is beyond me. Some of them haven't been diving long enough to have had a problem they had to solve underwater.  They needed a lot more individualized attention than they were going to get in a class of almost 20 people.  I really don't understand why PADI requires you to have been an instructor for at least two years before you can become a Master Instructor (which doesn't really mean anything- it's just a bit of recognition)- but you can go right from DM to instructor immediately (and that is a serious leap in responsibility).  I honestly believe they need to change the system and require people to have worked as a DM for a while. Either by assisting with X number of classes, by having acted as a guide for Y number of dives, or even just by showing proof of advanced training that requires buoyancy, trim, and situational awareness (Advanced Nitrox and Decompression procedures, Trimix, Full Cave, whatever)."

I'm sympathetic to the situations you listed and the whole 'race to the bottom' issue but none of what you cited appears to have had anything to do with the size of the organization or how many students it taught. Instead, all your scenarios have to do with the quality/standards of the students and with the quality/standards of the school. Those problems aren't unique to large operations by any measure. Like I said, it's the large operations that afford apprentice programs with lots of opportunities to practice and typically they got to be successful by being good (or at least better) at their job than their competition. The little outfits can do well but they often don't and if they do it's going to take longer."
scuba,38m1k3,Barking_at_the_Moon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sympathetic to the situations you listed and the whole 'race to the bottom' issue but none of what you cited appears to have had anything to do with the size of the organization or how many students it taught.   I specifically said they needed much more individualized attention:  ""They needed a lot more individualized attention than they were going to get in a class of almost 20 people.""  Also- regardless of what skills they leave the IDC with- I don't believe PADI should be passing an instructor that looks that bad in the water.  PADI has gotten very big by trying to be as inclusive as possible- to the point where I think the standards have fallen too far.   Like I said, it's the large operations that afford apprentice programs with lots of opportunities to practice   That's not what happens though. These IDC programs are 8 day ""let's cram everything into the shortest window possible. Size has nothing to do with the opportunity to practice- IDC students never get near real classes or lead real dives (at least at the places I've seen).  Larger operations can be useful when trying to become a DM- because yes- you will have a greater opportunity to work with students. Unfortunately- all too many of those programs are also pump and dump operations.  The truth is that most people can't become a DM in 5 days- even if they get to work with classes everyday. It takes time to assimilate information- figure out what works and what doesn't- then you need to re-evaluate your diving and look for ways to improve it.   and typically they got to be successful by being good (or at least better) at their job than their competition.   Don't conflate success with being good. They just need to be good enough.  Scuba is an expensive hobby. In many cases ""inexpensive"" is sufficient to get a lot of people in the door. Larger classes = amortizing costs over a larger number of people, but at the cost of personal attention.   The little outfits can do well but they often don't and if they do it's going to take longer.   I actually run the AI program at my shop and it does take longer- but not because of a lack of classes. We actually run multiple open water classes every week (never more than 4:1 student to instructor ratio- be it the pool or open water) so it's not like that's the bottleneck. It's just that I won't put my name on their card until I'm satisfied.  Some of the candidates are top notch divers with excellent situational awareness- and they sail through. Others I need to work with- sometimes on trim, or buoyancy, or managing students, or whatever.  Even for DM- PADI only requires you to work with a single open water class, and a single advanced class. We require our DMCs to work with at least 3 open water classes, and at least 2 advanced classes. Most end up assisting with many more. The difference it makes in their skills is astounding."
scuba,38m1k3,stds9tng,2,Fri Jun 5 20:43:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with the entire argument about a DI having more experience and dives.  Most teachers or instructors of a trade or a subject spend x amount of time as an assistant teacher/instructor.    My last dive I went on we had a diver teaching an open water class who was working on his instructor course. He was very comfortable and made or missed few things when teaching basic open water stuff. The trainee instructor was helped out by instructors the entire time to insure the lesson or task was taught right.   I heard of others who rushed the entire program (from first dive to instructor) who were just terrible teachers and had no love for what they were doing (they never did just a ""pleasure dive"") or the aptitude to explain complex items to new students.  They also ended up as only assistant instructors (in the pool) before returning to their corporate career."

scuba,38dppz,CanadianDiver,10,Wed Jun 3 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"I dive both extensively.   Is side mount going to be the new standard?   No- it's a perfect solution for caves and calm water locations. For rough boat diving, or for serious wreck penetration- sidemount is rarely the right choice (unless the wreck happens to be on her side).   Is side mount more convenient than diving doubles from a boat?   On a pitching boat it's a pain to gear up, it's a pain to get in the water, and it's a pain to get back on the boat. Add multiple stages and it's even worse.  If you live in an area with calm water and can drop your tanks over the side on a gear line- then it's great- but otherwise- I'll stick with backmount. Here in the NorthEast it's rarely calm enough to dive sidemount.   How about from shore?   Again- it depends on the dive. A quiet shore like before a cave dive, or at a quarry- it's great. Bring your tanks to the water one at a time, then just clip them on once you're in and they're buoyant. When trying to do a shore entry with them they just add more frontal cross section and the waves hit you even harder.   I think I understand the better suitability for cave diving, but for deeper diving is it better than back mounting?   Again- it depends. There are some definite advantages such as complete isolation of your gas supply, the ability to hand off a tank to an OOA diver, the ability to drop a tank or push it through an opening for a tight penetration, easier valve drills, the ability to breathe directly off a bottle if need be, and your horizontal trim will be perfect. On the other hand- if you lose a reg- you either need to swap regs under water- or you need to breathe directly off the bottle. Backmount sacrifices some isolation to simplify that process.  Backmount reduces task loading because you have a single regulator you breathe from, it's easier to get on and off a boat with the tanks securely fastened to your back rather than bouncing around all over your side, and for wreck diving- it's easier to get into other positions when penetrating a wreck without your rig immediately trying to roll you upright and into trim.   When you start adding a couple of deco bottles, is it better?   Adding bottles isn't a problem for either system- except when the seas get rough. If I need to climb the ladder with all my gear (including stages) then I definitely want backmount. I simply can't climb the ladder in sidemount with multiple stages.   For those of you that have switched, if you could go back would you still switch from your doubles or would you not bother?   Again- I dive both and I don't believe one is inherently better than the other. Both systems are tools and you choose the best one for the job.  I dive sidemount in caves. I dive backmount in wrecks.  If I am traveling- I will bring my SMS50 sidemount rig because it's light, and I can just grab any two tanks off the boat. That allows me to get redundancy on a dive trip without having to lug or rent doubles. At the same time- I don't go on that sort of dive trip to dive in rough seas so if it's too rough for sidemount- it's too rough for me to dive at all and I will happily head to the bar instead :)"
scuba,38dppz,stds9tng,3,Wed Jun 3 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"This is going to be an interesting discussion as both systems have their evangelical proponents.   On a New England dive charter boat, I don't believe sidemount is the right tool.  In fact it's down right cumbersome on a rocking boat in rough seas gearing up.  I think it's a fine system/tool for caves, calm seas and shore dives but I have not had great experiences supporting divers with in New England.    Before I switched to a rebreather this year, I've dove backmounted doubles for the last 6 years so perhaps I'm a little biased but as someone who works on a charter boat I hate sidemount.   I'm not saying it's a bad system but pretty much EVERY person who does sidemount and comes out with us is constantly fiddling with their gear and requires twice as much help as people who are diving backmounted doubles, rebreathers or singles.  I have seen sidemount proponents tout it as being easier but the fact is I never see people in backmounted doubles struggle to clip their bottles or route hoses nearly as much as sidemount divers.  Usually backmounted doubles and rebreather peoples are already in the water and on the wreck by the time sidemount people finish gearing up.  I don't think it's great in rough seas when people are trying to clip and unclip bottles, getting back into the rocking boat with swells.   There are times when currents and rough seas really prevent divers from jumping in the water and clipping on their bottles last.     There are times where we need to do a negative entry or hot drop so that you can get down to the wreck or mooring line in current.  Spending extra time on the surface attaching bottles will have you easily drift off the wreck or away from mooring line or off the scallop bed that we are drifting over.  Most divers in sidemount have far too wide profile and end up hitting the sides of our boat when exiting or entering without taking their bottles off. For certain wrecks like the U-853, the USS Bass and other wrecks with narrow entries and pathways, you're not going to dive inside the entire wreck with both bottles in front of you. It's just not going to happen."

It's just not going to happen.   True- but you don't always need to swing both bottles to reduce the profile enough to get inside- you can often swing just one bottle and still get inside. That said- I completely agree that sidemount is not appropriate in a lot of conditions- especially the NorthEast.  Do you crew on a boat up here and if so- which one?"

scuba,38dppz,AussieEquiv,3,Thu Jun 4 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Sidemount is a tool to get a job done. recreational sidemount, or sidemount as a standard makes no sense.  Doubles are redundant and easy to carry and manage.    Think about stage (deco) bottle.  You've got doubles on you back out of the way and then add tanks to your side.  In SM you already have tanks on your side, now you are adding more?  It's asking for a mess and a bottle mix up.     Someone mentioned CCr taking over for doubles which is closer to the truth with the way Helium prices are going, but that is still anouter 10-20 years out. No one can afford a RB unit unless they are super dedicated to their diving.  The tech is pushing forward now that the economy is better. they'll get smaller and safer.  Doubles will reign supreme for a long time to come."
scuba,38dppz,richiericardo,2,Thu Jun 4 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"I gave my doubles away. Sidemount is so much easier when reboarding the boat.   Just unclip the tanks, clip them to a l ine you dropped over the side, walk up the ladder and haul your tanks up one at a time, or ask a boat hand to do it.  It makes me almost 100 lbs lighter when reboarding.  Also, you have 100% redundancy and don't need to flexibility of a circus performer to shut down the manifold you don't have anymore."
scuba,38dppz,none_shall_pass,2,Wed Jun 3 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"What happens if you are diving somewhere that 3ft swell is ""the norm"". In the North Atlantic we can't use gear lines to leave gear or else it will all get smashed into the bottom of the boat, or itself. Climbing back onboard a boat in those conditions is extremely difficult with sidemounted tanks, and much easier with backmounted.  Don't say ""I wouldn't dive that"" because that isn't a valid argument. High sea state is the norm for many divers."
scuba,38dppz,kroneksix,2,Wed Jun 3 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"What happens if you are diving somewhere that 3ft swell is ""the norm"".    You hand the tanks up one at a time. Or clip them off on the hoist. Or whatever. How would they get the anchor up if they anchored?   It's always easier to get up the ladder without 100Lbs of steel on your back, especially in big waves.  OTOH, I don't actually care what anybody else dives and have no interest in converting anybody, so feel free to use it or not."
scuba,38dppz,none_shall_pass,3,Wed Jun 3 18:50:45 2015 UTC,You hand the tanks up one at a time.    In 3' foot seas- perhaps. In 6's which are also surprisingly common up here? No way.   Or clip them off on the hoist. Or whatever.   Here in the northeast that's generally frowned upon. Tanks jumping up or down 6' at a time are a hazard to other divers and they are additional items that may need to be cut away if the boat needs to cut and run to pick up someone swept away.   How would they get the anchor up if they anchored?    The boat unclips and gets the hell out of there. A diver is hot dropped to go down and untie from the wreck. The ball and line is then simply scooped up along with the remaining diver. No anchors involved.

scuba,38dppz,none_shall_pass,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I'm in the northeast too.   Where and what boats do you dive off of? The ones I use hate sidemount so I'd love to know of other options.  I also dive in Florida quite a bit and hot drops are common. Trying to get two tanks and multiple stages with a hot drop is brutal. But I routinely hot drop with two back mounted tanks and 3 stages without issue (2 40's on one side, 1 80 on the other).   And also wreck dive.   How do you handle penetrations in tight wrecks like the Bass or 853? I'll swing both tanks to get through a hatch, or a single tank for a passageway, but doing an entire dive in the 853 like that would drive me insane.   And when the seas are 6', I don't go in.   Perfectly valid option. I like to be able to dive in any reasonable conditions. If I have planned a Doria trip- I'm going even if the seas are 6'.  As I've said before- I dive sidemount all the time. I just don't consider it appropriate when I'm in a wreck or with bad seas. Doubles mean I can always do the dive. Sidemount means I may not be able to."
scuba,38dppz,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 3 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"You hand the tanks up one at a time.   I saw someone do that once. Once. He didn't time things right, tank cracked him in the head as the boat came down, and the crew almost dropped his tank.   Or clip them off on the hoist. Or whatever. How would they get the anchor up if they anchored?   If you leave tanks in the water, they will get smashed together, or onto the boat. They have to be worn out of the water."
scuba,38dppz,kroneksix,2,Wed Jun 3 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"I went from backmount, to sidemount for about 20 dives, and then back to backmount.   Once you start adding Deco bottles I feel backmount is better.   Also one think people seem to forget with sidemount is that there is nothing joining the 2 tanks at all. If, for example an O-Ring ruptures on one of the tanks, that's 1/2 of your air that is not usable at best, or gone at the worst putting you off balance.   On backmount doubles, there needs to be catastrophic failure of either a valve or the manifold to render any of your air supply unusable. Also, there is no need to switch regulators part way through a dive, and less to keep track of in general.   For me the weight distribution is no issue, I am 6'2'' and well built, the weight on my back getting out of the water is not a problem, but I see how it could be for some people. Personally I prefer to have more depth rather than more width in my setup.  There is also something that is strangely reassuring I find about having your tanks bolted to your back.   However I will say that my experience is purely cold water, mid/strong current diving. Perhaps in warmer water side-mount would be preferable. I also don't cave dive, so I cant say anything about that.   I would highly recommend trying both to those interested. People can vary hugely in why they prefer one over the other.   Here is an interesting article about some of the benefits of back mount   If someone has a sidemount equivalent, then let me know and I'll edit it in."
scuba,38dppz,B0bbySmile,3,Wed Jun 3 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"If, for example an O-Ring ruptures on one of the tanks, that's 1/2 of your air that is not usable at best, or gone at the worst putting you off balance.    If you lose an O-ring on backmounted doubles you've lost half your air as well. The valve is downstream of the air in the tank so isolating it won't accomplish anything.  If you lose a regulator then yes- the air is still there but unusable with a sidemount rig- well- sort of. One of the things you practice in an advanced sidemount class are things like swapping regulators underwater and breathing directly off the bottle. Neither one is a big deal with some experience."
scuba,38dppz,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 3 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on which o-ring you are referring to.  On an isolation manifold, the o-ring on your first stage at the valve is not a critical failure because you can shut down the post and still access all your gas. There are no other o-rings in a valve that cannot be isolated in a post shutdown.  If your o-ring between the valve and the tank failed ... ok, that is not recoverable. Also, the o-ring on the cross bar could be considered non-recoverable however most (but not all) manifolds use a double o-ring on each side of the crossbar which adds redundancy. I do have an OMS manifold that does not work this way, it has a single captured o-ring design on each side of the crossbar."
scuba,38dppz,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 3 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on which o-ring you are referring to.   Parent specifically said ""If, for example an O-Ring ruptures on one of the tanks,"" which is a tank O-ring to me. A regulator O-ring is a regulator O-ring.  I also addressed this with the second paragraph where I talked about what happens if you lose a regulator (o-ring, free flow, whatever):  ""If you lose a regulator then yes- the air is still there but unusable with a sidemount rig- well- sort of."""
scuba,38dppz,stds9tng,2,Wed Jun 3 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"I just thought it an odd statement as I personally have never heard of the neck o-ring failing. Sure it is technically possible, but it receives no wear and tear and is pretty much always replaced every time you pull the valve."

Either way- it's not a big problem to deal with even in sidemount. Worst case you're breathing off the bottle. Alternatively- you can simply swap a new reg on if you have a spare and need the gas."
scuba,38e1sa,daverb,5,Wed Jun 3 16:36:12 2015 UTC,Just keep in mind that they are wild animals and are inherently predators. I'm not saying don't do it by any means but just be careful.  Heres a list of places that have orca diving http://www.divereport.com/animals/orca/
scuba,38e1sa,UnderwaterNerd,2,Wed Jun 3 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"You are going to have a lot of trouble legally interacting (boat or diver) with orcas in most countries.    The idea that all orcas are inherently predators and dangerous is probably a bit overblown as many localized populations of orcas are known as exclusive fish eaters and do not instinctually attack a large mammal (though they might physically investigate a slow moving one wearing a shiny cylinder on its back).  I would be extremely nervous, but could bring myself to get in the water with resident orcas here in Puget sound for example, but I would not even think about getting in the water with a transient pod (the transients in this region are not known to eat fish and have a diet almost exclusively consisting of seals and sea lions, yikes!).   All that said, in most respectable places you cannot drive a boat close to orcas and if you were to get in the water your chances of having any kind of up close encounter are fairly slim.  I'd say just enjoy them from the surface, they are pretty incredible to watch, even from a distance."
scuba,38e1sa,disastrophy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there a story about a child playing in the water on BC's sunshine coast when an orca came in at full speed thinking he was a seal. By the time he got to the kid he had hit the brakes, didn't even touch him and swam off uninterested as it wasn't food. I can't get a source in that, just something I heard growing up in Vancouver. I think the danger is next to nothing unless you're a Seaworld trainer."

scuba,38ezg6,WnbTravellerDude,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"Agree on this.  The doctor may say its okay; but the doctor may not be a diver and understand about the effects on pressure or equalizing.  I know from surfing with a ruptured ear drum that I am more prone to ear infections.. oh and just plain pain and temporary hearing loss as water enters into the ""middle ear"".  This is also wearing ear plugs to help prevent the water as water always finds a way in...  If you have access to DAN (Divers Alert Network) you can call them at 1-919-684-9111 or probably on their website.  When all else fails.. ask your local dive instructor."
scuba,38ezg6,Dalarast,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"Here's what DAN will tell him (emphasis added):   A perforated tympanic membrane (ear drum) can occur from diving as well as from non-diving causes. Most traumatic perforations heal spontaneously. Following an appropriate time after they have healed, you can return to diving if your physician feels the healing is solid and there is no evidence of Eustachian tube problems. This usually takes about two months after it is healed.  If the perforation does not heal, then an ear surgeon can repair the damage. After healing has taken place, the same rules about returning to diving above apply. It is important to check for chronic nose and sinus problems if there is no healing.  Chronic perforations that do not heal are a contraindication to diving. Some have advocated the use of ear plugs for these individuals, but if there is any water leakage, it could cause a severe infection.   I've known a number of divers that have suffered from perforated eardrums and I have never heard of any of them being cleared to dive until the eardrum has healed completely. I would be highly suspicious of any advice to the contrary and would seek out not just DAN's advice but an ENT with experience in diving and barotrauma before I decided to get back in the water with a hole in my ear drum."
scuba,38ezg6,Barking_at_the_Moon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"Normally you wouldn't dive with ear plugs or anything in your ears because you can't clear the air between your eardrum and the plug. But if you have a ruptured eardrum this would not be an issue.  So yea, I think diving should be fine. I would definitely put something in the ear since I think you're more likely to get an ear infection if you don't. But which of those things would work best in keeping the water out, I have no idea. I'd try it in a swimming pool."
scuba,38ezg6,sukosevato,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"Doctor says it's okay then I can't see why you can't give it a go in a swimming pool or something to begin with and then go from there, descend slowly and make sure your instructor is aware of your problem and just feel for any issues. Get some vented earplugs of which I have no experience using but they will help to prevent the inevitable ear infections you'll get with a ruptured eardrum."
scuba,38fvgi,anthonyg1500,4,Wed Jun 3 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"Also, don't go too cheap, you want an education that will keep you alive while diving in Iceland, and odds are you are going to need drysuit fitting and training too right?  Being in NY, they should offer a drysuit course or upgrade of sometime.  Water temp at Silfra is about 32F so... 44 is the coldest drysuit dive I've done and it was pretty cold even with DUI 450G undergarmets.   If you get a leak in 32F you are calling the dive.   Drysuits can be tricky if you are new to scuba or if you are a ""master"" diver.   I depends on the individual and their skill set.  Gas management becomes a big issue.  Use your money wisely, but focus on a solid education that will keep you alive and teach you what you need to know.  I know you wanted to hear cheapest, and that is cool if you are only gonna dive once ever on that one vacation on a trpoical cruise.  Otherwise, if you live in a cold water region like NY and are visiting an even colder region, iceland, then you want a quality education that will make you a better, safer, thinking diver.

It was 35.5F when they did Silfra which isn't for the feint hearted. I dive the temperature curve through the winter in the UK and those temperatures make me feel cold just thinking about them!  You'll need your open water with drysuit speciality plus at least 10-20 dives on top in a drysuit in cold temps before I'd say you're good to go. It's not a difficult dive... It's just oh so cold!!

A bit of history of the site: Way back when Barbados was a main trading hub (mainly British) at its peak over a thousand ships could be found in this particular bay at one timw. Some of the ship's had to be quarantined for a while before coming to shore.  The particular reef this bottle was found on was an anchoring site for quarantined ship's. It's not a wide reef (plataues about 18m depth about 20ft wide) and either side has a steep slope to 45 - 50m where the sea floor levels. At that depth after accounting for where  the ship's would of sat after anchoring, is basically a mess of loads of old rum bottles and other things from the hundreds of ship's that used the site. This particular one was the oldest one of the lot found amongst the rest. Would of brought of more up but had no bag, so just what I could carry and one of the many hench lionfish who now preside down there guarding said booty."

scuba,387gwj,Bubbles7066,-1,Wed Jun 3 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Might not be perfect for the environment, but old objects are part of the cultural heritage, and removing them from their context destroys valuable archaeological information."
scuba,387gwj,Barking_at_the_Moon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"Like I said, left alone long enough and trash can become treasure. Absent it's presence in a midden or tell (or shipwreck) an old bottle doesn't have much of the historical context that might provide it with value, nor does coral encrustation intrinsically increase it's value.  Sometimes most of the time a piece of junk lying on the bottom is exactly that. Think of OP as someone on one of those harbor clean-up dives writ large, doing his bit to protect and preserve the environment without doing any significant damage to the historical record of human pollution."
scuba,387gwj,Bubbles7066,-1,Wed Jun 3 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this particular example might not be valuable, but did OP know this? Judging by the title OP didn't, and so it is chance whether a find like this is valuable or not, and once it's been taken up, there's no way of ever getting that information back. I'm not trying to have a go at OP, but really the handling, recording and recovery of artefacts should be left to trained professionals who will follow proper procedure.   Also, I'm not really sure about this point about trash becoming treasure. Rubbish has massive archaeological importance, and 'trash' like this can tell us much about the everyday lives of past people. Granted, we should make a constant effort to remove modern rubbish but that does not mean we should start taking any man made objects from the seabed, because we will be destroying potential archaeological information.  Also, you keep using words like treasure and value, which in my opinion makes me think you are considering these objects in terms of financial value (correct me if I'm wrong). This isn't about money, it's about preserving our underwater heritage so it can both be enjoyed by others and also studied by professionals."
scuba,387gwj,Barking_at_the_Moon,0,Wed Jun 3 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this particular example might not be valuable, but did OP know this?   When you pick a beer can up from the side of the road, do you know (or care) if it has any value? I don't: it's a nuisance and it needs to be somewhere else. Just because it's on the bottom of the ocean doesn't lend it any particular value, though to my sensibilities the fact that it's on the bottom of the ocean magnifies it's negative value.    Granted, we should make a constant effort to remove modern rubbish   My point, exactly. The chances that OP was damaging a priceless cultural heritage site are vanishingly small. Instead, he was clearing crap from the sea even if he was doing it because he thought it was interesting instead of disgusting.    Also, you keep using words like treasure and value, which in my opinion makes me think you are considering these objects in terms of financial value (correct me if I'm wrong).   You're wrong. Value is often quantified in monetary terms but the reason some things are called ""priceless"" is because their value can't be expressed like that. To me, the sea truly is priceless and anything that doesn't belong there doesn't belong there. Except me, and I'm trying to do everything I can to mitigate the damage that humans can cause.  Leave nothing but bubbles, take nothing but pictures - and trash."
scuba,387gwj,cerealdaemon,0,Wed Jun 3 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"This is where we differ. You obviously don't care about underwater cultural heritage, archaeology, or our shared past. The fact that you label it alongside modern rubbish, completely ignoring everything I've said about context and archaeological significance shows this.   Would you have every shipwreck, sunken harbour, human body removed off the ocean by amateurs because they don't 'belong' there?   Also, I'm still not understanding how you can think you can classify the value of a cultural site before it has been studied and documented. If you have a solution I'm sure the thousands of archaeologists will be dying to here it, as they sure don't have one.   But still, as I've said, you obviously don't care about that, so think of it this way. If I remove a small amount of coral from a large reef because my untrained eye thinks it's dead and useless, is that okay? Would a conservationist be alright with my amateur judgment? Still, even if I had removed a little bit, there's so much more right, my little bit couldn't hurt? Obviously removing it would be a bad thing, not only because of the individual damage, but also because it could encourage others to do so. In the 1950's thousands of sites were sacked until legislation was put in to protect them, but the damage remains, and is a real reminder of how much damage is caused by amateurs and treasure hunters removing objects from the sea.  Look, I get you love the ocean, and it'd wildlife. That's great, obviously, but I love archaeology and cultural heritage, and you don't seem to understand that when people start lifting objects it pains me as much as people harming the environment."

In general, I prefer to bring my gear (since I own it), but this generally assumes that it is a vacation with a primary intent to go diving.    For a holiday where there isn't diving already planned/booked as a main activity, I'd be okay with leaving most of it at home.  If there's water and 'probably' some reasonable likelihood of taking a dive day, I'll take along my perscription mask, plus perhaps also my full set of snorkel gear (and an UW camera system).  Overall, it comes down to two factors for me:   Do I really expect to be doing diving on the trip (versus other activities) and what percentage or how many dive-days?   How {heavy/light} do I expect to be traveling?   For example, a week in Southern FL where I might get in a day down in the Keys, then its the ""just in case"" mask & fins.  OTOH, a long weekend to the Keys specifically do dive with some buddies...it all goes.  Similarly, a trip to the In-Laws on the panhandle...carry-on baggage light, so not even the mask - - but when plans add a buddy for a meet up to go on a bug dive...weigh down and bring a checked bag of dive gear.    -hh"

When going to a liveaboard, one takes a lot of support equipment, in case something needs to be swapped out using proper tools. Just that is a pain to take.

There's various levels of authority to make various levels of impact.  Your impact findings apparently were not enough to stop the mission.  Not a waste of time at all when you consider that you were there for your expertise and to inform them, not to be the deciding authority yourself.  I've seen plenty of construction, development, and operations plans scrapped because of environmental and/or cultural impact.

I understand all that, cost-benefit analysis and such; I think my point was ruminating in my head and I didn't really get to it on here. This place is a disaster ecologically. Honestly, I don't even know where to start. Between all the colonizations and wars and just general anthropological impacts this region has been completely flipped on its head. Now we have global climate patterns that have tipped off mass bleaching events, not to mention a new typhoon every few weeks. So, working in the field, when you finally find an endemic species, hell, even just a naturalized species, chances are that no one knows very much about it and you can't help but to get the little glimmer of hope that you can figure out it's ecological niche before some military plows over it or a local burns it up in some hunting arson. It baffles me how much science can be done here because it just simply hasn't been done . As far as endangered species, that's such a politically charged topic that I really don't  know how to describe how disgusting it can be. I have seen local fishermen win against species protection for coral because it'll hurt their business- and those same guys infiltrate the local police department to rig the conservation officers dispatch... Which brings me to my conflicted thoughts about Pagan.  These islands are a mix of hopelessness and untapped wonder. I grew up in Nevada and am not clueless about living in a region with government testing. I've seen what it's done. That being said.... I'd prefer my country's military to be very well prepared and do what they need to do to ensure that. Is this the best place for it? Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know that. But for this group of locals who have been raped and pillaged from countless other cultures, another infringement upon ""their home"" is becoming the last straw; so now you have a bunch of pissed off islanders to boot. Now add in all the other countries in this region that are adding to the abuse of regional biota. It's hard not to get bogged down by all the negativity of these things.   Ah.

A ""Diver style watch"" is probably great for posing down the pub but, sadly, nobody will notice any way so even that doesn't work.  I use a G-Shock Solar by Casio as a watch. I don't actually use it in the water but it's round my drysuit cuff and under the skirt of my glove so if I want to know the time it's there. However both the computer built into my rig and the one on my other wrist both show the time so I'm not quite sure why I carry it. It has been to 70 meters though."

Don't know how it would cope with salt water, but the guy who recommended it to me was definitely a salt water diver. Just don't press the buttons under water."

It looks to be quite a bit bigger and deploys 2 skiffs when taking divers out. It holds 20 passengers.   Finally there's the Fiji Siren, which has that Indonesian sail boat look to it. I don't have much information on them other than they wouldn't return our radio calls when figuring which dive sites everyone was going to after hiding from the weather in the lee of one of the islands.

When I use my friends I have just a wrist strap and hold it in my hand. Some people use a short pole, some use a long pole. For Pics and ok video, hand is just fine. For better stability while recording you might want to use a pole.

scuba,3855fe,Bit_Fox,3,Mon Jun 1 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Generically speaking, an unbalanced regulators suffer from needing different inhalation effort as cylinder and ambient pressures change. The deeper you go or the less air in your cylinder, the harder it is to breathe. Not a good choice unless all your diving is going to be very shallow.  Balanced regulators are called that because they balance the medium pressure output of the first stage with the ambient pressure, which results in an even, consistent breathing effort without regard for your depth or how much air you have left. An excellent choice for most divers.  Over-balanced (hyper-balanced) regulators do essentially the same thing at the first stage, balancing the cylinder pressure with the medium pressure. Better than unbalanced but not as good as balanced.  Combine a hyper-balanced first with a balanced second and you have the opportunity to find out what it is like for your regulator to actually PUSH air at you once you crack the valves open with your inhalation, requiring effort to stop breathing. It's silly and it wastes air. All in all, hyper-balancing is so much marketing silt in the water and should be ignored if not avoided."

That's not to say their gear is bad, I just didn't like it. The ""hyper balanced"" thing is most likely a gimmick.   Edge gear is good, can also look up their sister company HOG which has grown in popularity lately due to their price. Good gear and moderately priced.   Other brands you can look into are Atomic (I dive M1's but they're pretty pricey), Scubapro (I used to dive mk17 and g250v's and they're great regs), Apex and DiveRite (similar to HOG prices and also great regs)."

Boats for wrecks typically and there are some half decent reefs along the south shore a hundred feet out tops. Id reccomend going off john smiths bay or church bay. Church bay can be good for just snorkeling too. Its pretty rocky and reefy compared to horseshoes where you will get looked at very oddly and may not even be allowed to scuba at the beach.

Expect to pay about $100 for a two tank w/ rentals. El Bajo, El Cantil, Los Morros, El Islote, and the shipwreck there are all great dive sites. Snorkeling is ok, but to see the big schools you need to go to the deeper sites. Also, as of two weeks ago you can still snorkel with whale sharks in La Paz. There's also some cool hot springs near Santiago I think, but it's on a rough dirt road that my rental sedan barely survived.

scuba,382wff,N0VA_PR1ME,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:32:15 2015 UTC,Just depends on the conditions that day. The boats are small pangas with small dive groups so just tell the dive masters what you want to see and they'll get you to the site that is best at the time. Try to do at least one of the sites near El Bajo though since that's where the big schools tend to congregate.

scuba,3826uj,Alison_37,2,Mon Jun 1 09:04:47 2015 UTC,"Make sure you actually learn the skills in the pool sessions. That might seem like a no brainer, but depending on how fast their boss wants to push people through many instructors will accept your single fluke as good enough...  I find that anxiety tends to be related to facing the unknown and/or not feeling like I have the skills to cope with something unexpected. If you learn the skills properly, it'll counter both those things.  For example, one of the skills you'll learn is how to clear water out of your mask. A lot of people who aren't confident swimmers find that very difficult, but it is very important to practice it until you can do it easily without worrying about it. Why? Because if your mask floods 15m underwater, you want to know that you'll just think ""oh right, I just lift a bit and blow out my nose..."" and you're fine. But if you're not comfortable doing it, you'll be thinking ""omg! I can't see! I have to get out here!"" and you'll panic and surface too quickly. And that's a skill you can practice on your own with your partner - you don't need an instructor to stand in the shallow end of a pool blowing bubbles out your nose ;)"

He's a master instructor (top cert you can get?) and makes sure everyone is comfortable in the water. He was brilliant when I did my try dive in the pool (Christmas present from partner) and I loved it!

scuba,3826uj,EYEJ,2,Tue Jun 2 08:50:22 2015 UTC,"I struggled with a couple of the skills while underwater.   Particularly full mask flooding, removal, donning, and clearing.   I'm a nose breather primarily, and even when I'm breathing through my mouth I tend to have some air movement in and out of my mouth.   So, due to the mammalian dive reflex, when that first gush of water hit my face I snorted water and up to the surface I went, with the instructor.   My advice: practice some of the things before you dive.   Do you have a mask and snorkel? If not, get a set.   Fill your tub with water and dunk your head and practice smooth, controlled breathing while pulling the mask off and putting it back on. If you do this while the water is colder than the temp of the waters you're to be diving in, then you will see improvement in this skill.   You'll be basically training your body to not have its normal reaction to cold water hitting the face suddenly.   http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/new-divers-and-those-considering-diving/395914-trouble-no-mask-breathing-cold-water.html  that link has some comments that will help you prepare for mask removal at depth, particularly in the cold.

Lesson 1: that much neoprene is very buoyant. I needed something like 20lb of weight just to offset the wetsuit. (Then again, I'm a big guy. Your mileage may vary.) Bring plenty of weight. - along the same lines: practice mask clearing in cold water. I was good at it in the pool, but at 48 degrees, it took me 2 tries. - if you're in a group, make sure you have a way to tell your buddy apart. Our group was 6 people (my wife, myself, the instructor, an assistant, and 2 other trainees). It can be a challenge to identify 1 person in a group like that. Bright colors help...my wife has a bright pink mask strap cover, and that was great. - if you're renting equipment, take a couple of minutes to get it set up the way you like it. On my BC, the compass was hooked into the same d-ring as my octopus. That didn't work for me. There is a lot to think about, so make sure to simplify what you can. - proper buoyancy control is not easy. Make sure to keep on top of it."

But it would be more worth it to OP if they bought a $150 dive computer instead of deciding whether to buy a $15 watch based on a discussion between two anons on the internet.  In my experience, I dive cold water and I don't typically dive deeper than 60ft/18m. A waterproof stopwatch is fine in my case, as I'm never going to hit the NDL on any dive, even during a second dive. It's just too darn cold to stay in the water that long. So in my case, a waterproof stopwatch has worked fine for me.  If you're going to get a watch or a computer, though, I'd still recommend a computer."

scuba,3811t1,boredinottawa2015,7,Mon Jun 1 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"FYI, while doing a Discover Dive anywhere else is about $80-$150, at the Great Barrier Reef it's much more expensive, because it's such a long boat trip.  Some quick googling shows its about $200-$300: http://www.diversden.com.au/cairns-introductory-diving.html http://cairnsdiveadventures.com.au/reef-tours-cairns/cairns-introductory-diving/ http://www.tusadive.com/reef_day_trips/introductory_diving.html  A better recommendation would be to learn to dive somewhere warm and cheap (Koh Tao, Thailand, or Nha Trang, Vietnam are two of the cheapest, but there are lots of options around the world) for about $300. 3 day course, usually, and includes 4+ dives.  Then you can dive the Great Barrier reef in comfort and about $100/day less.  Also, because the GBR is so far out, consider other options than just day trips (like a live aboard)."
scuba,3811t1,fruchle,-1,Mon Jun 1 04:57:32 2015 UTC,Learning to dive at the cheapest shop is silly.   You should learn at a shop that does great training.   It's only your life.

It has Ban's, which trains more divers than anywhere in the world. Your recommendation is based on a combination of ignorance and stupidity. It does the hundreds of world-class instructors who are there at any one time a great disservice, and insults the thousands upon thousands of people who go there to learn.  Your comparison - your entire comment is full of unrelated gibberish.   Learning to dive at the cheapest shop is silly. You should learn at a shop that does great training.   And you know what's amazing? You can find a place which is both - and ""there are lots of options around the world"".  I know some places you can spend $650+ to get your Open Water cert, and it is 0% better than the $275 I spent on mine. (Spectacular, 5-star PADI centre, brilliant instructors)  I know some retards who think that spending $1000 on a Shoei motorcycle helmet is ""safer' than a $150 HJC helmet (it's not, they're exactly the same - by safety standards). Or spending $17,000 on a top end Apple Watch vs a $350 Apple Watch (again, they're exactly the same - one is just shinier).  Money isn't everything.   Would you choose the cheap doctor or the good doctor to do eye surgery on you?   I would choose both.  For example, you can get a shitty doctor in a shitty surgery in the USA to do LASIK for about $5000.  Or, you get go to a state of the art, top of the line centre in Bangkok, with some of the best surgeons in the world for about $2500.  Cheapest AND best.

scuba,3811t1,fruchle,3,Wed Jun 3 05:37:51 2015 UTC,You can do a Discovery scuba dive with about 2 hours of training for 100-150 USD. This is only good for one or two dives though. If you really want to explore the reef I would get certified with your local dive shop before going. Prices for that vary so you might want to call or check their website.
scuba,3811t1,UnderwaterNerd,2,Mon Jun 1 03:47:00 2015 UTC,No you do not need to be scuba certified. You can do a little discover scuba where the instructor practically hold your hand and takes you down for a few minutes then right back up with out really going anywhere. Or many of the dive shops do full open water courses as well on the reef with a previous pool session before on the mainland. If you really want to get allot out of the reef I'd recommend a liveaboard trip for three days. I personally did my advanced course on pro dives liveaboard while a bunch of other divers were doing there open water with other instructors. It ran about 750 dollars I think for me just over a year ago. I can't attest to any other companies but the instructors I had were amazing and fun to live with for a few days

Especially at the end of the program, where they mentioned that during the making they were diving among sharks for three years? Not one incident occurred. Also, the white shark clips where they started banging on about body language was quite profound. The most settling for my JAWS-ified brain was the clip where they descended with a cage to the ocean bed, climbed out, and there were whites swimming around them minding their own bees wax. That was fantastic for me and my pre conceptions. Overall I really enjoyed the doc, lots of new and super interesting information, which I find is becoming increasingly rare in documentaries."

First time we did it I was so paranoid that we hauled them up too fast and they were stuck in the cage while their dive watches were blaring from ascending too fast, thankfully it was a short trip up though.  But the real problem they had filming is that the whites were actually scared of the bubbles from the scuba tanks and even getting to a reasonable distance was hard sometimes...that and the weather was heinous, I also remember coming in and getting soaked by waves in the face and looking back at the end to see the film crew huddled behind me."

scuba,380y7p,ifuckedurmomtwice,2,Mon Jun 1 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb is wide & macro.     You can shoot longer distances UW with either, although as a general rule of thumb, strobe illumination is mostly gone by the time that you're 6ft away...even with bigger strobes (I have a pair of the DS-161's).  Anticipate that at such distances that your general intent is monochrome, unless you're really shallow.   Overall, if you can get the lens to focus, you'll get something .. its just a question of if that is something you'll like ;-)  Wide:  Figure ~15mm as a goal, based on the traditional benchmark ofthe ancient Nikonos based Nikkor 15mm.  With 'crop body' (such as your Nikon D7000 and my Canon 7D), 15mm would mean using a ~10mm (15mm equivalent) but behind a dome (such as your 6""; I'm using the Ikelite 8"")  In modernizing, do expect/consider a WA Zoom here and cover some focal length range.  FYI, you'll probably need a +2 or +4 close-up lens...they're apparently more common when the wide angle is also a zoom...but even so, don't be surprised by blurred corners when all the way wide.  Overall, this is really a testament to just how good the optics were on the ancient Nikkor 15mm.    For example, I'm using the Canon 10-22mm EF-S (with a +2) and although I usually use it wide (10mm), bringing it towards 22mm goes provide the equivalence to the old Nikkor 20mm, 28mm and even 35mm, which gives utility for diver and fish portraits.  Macro:  I'm using a fixed EF-S 60mm (~100mm equivalent) behind a flat port.  Overall, its been a good all-around compromise lens ... not too long.  The good news here is that because you're not stuck to shooting at only one specific manual-focus distance like the old Nikonos ""Goal Posts"", you have a bit more variability/flexibility in magnification ratios, so you can go from low magnification through medium .. to high  ...although the bad news trade-off here is that you're relying on autofocus, so limited lighting, foreground clutter and surge/current are all enemies to the performance of autofocus system to work to get the shot.    Personally, I've been struggling with camera settings for macro.  I've gone to a single (""Spot"") box for focus to minimize clutter problems (focusing on a not-desired object within the frame), but this also degrades AutoFocus performance.  And I'm also trying to get away from the ""P"" (Automatic) to try to force the camera to more easily work with a higher aperature to increase the depth-of-field.      Now in looking at the lenses you have, the only one that I'd even consider putting in an UW housing would be the 16-35, and even that is a bit marginal on a crop body such as the D7000, because it is effectively a {24mm-50mm} - used wide, its a fish/diver portait lens and used long, ... well, it depends on its minimum focus length to see if it can do anything quasi-macro.  Overall, this lens would be much better UW if the body was a Full Frame."

They are pricier than some of the other liveaboards but all equipment and nitrox is free, so are your transfers. http://sirenfleet.com/liveaboards/palau.html. The aggressor run by SAMs tours will be a bit cheaper.  Flights can be expensive depending on where you are coming from.  It was a special trip, for my fiancés 40th so once In a lifetime splurge. Diving is worth it."

scuba,37vm71,Sobepalauan,1 point,Sun May 31 05:34:22 2015 UTC,"Went with the Palau Siren. They were very good. They are a bit more luxury than some of the other liveaboards. Sams tours is probably the most popular dive operator there. They run the aggressor liveaboards. You can do day dives from shore, but the skiff rides out to some of the sites will be very long. With the liveaboards, you still have to do skiff rides out to the sites, they are just much shorter.   Spent a week in Palau  doing all the major dive sites blue corner, blue hole, ulong channel, etc.. and a week in Yap diving with the mantas.  Edited spelling. Friggin autocorrect"

scuba,37vvd6,Woogies,3,Sat May 30 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"I started my underwater adventures freediving, as it was all I could afford at the time. The same set of fins I had at the time lasted me all the way through to my instructors.   There is no 'rule book' as to what fin you have to wear. It comes down to personal preference, and for me the freediving fins were perfect. Insulation isn't a gigantic issue if you have decent access to appropriate thickness/length socks and I dived single digit lakes without issue. Control and positioning has always been easier for me in freediving fins than it was in floppy and powerless split fins. I can see where /u/crumpethead is coming from, but in hundreds of dives with peers in a varying range of boats and dive conditions I was never an outlier in getting ready so long as I prepared appropriately for the entry.  In the end it comes down to personal choice, one that only you can make and shouldn't be swayed by people on the internet wanting to make the decision for you. Ask your dive store to try out different fins and see how different types feel for you.  Good luck and have fun!  (If you do go for freediving fins I recommend getting 2 piece - replaceable blade - over one piece, so that if something breaks you can simply replace one part rather than having to buy a complete set again. Make sure that the blades are purchaseable separately, as I have not been able to find replacement blades for my fins despite them being removeable...)"
scuba,37vvd6,Ornate_Giant,2,Sun May 31 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"You are going to want open fins, having the ability to change the amount of insulation on your feet is pretty much a required feature unless you only ever dive in the warmest of water."
scuba,37vvd6,carbonnanotube,2,Sat May 30 21:39:36 2015 UTC,or... just buy bigger foot pockets and wear thick socks? You're not going to cook wearing 5mm socks in the tropics. You are going to freeze without them in temperate waters....
scuba,37vvd6,cradossk,2,Sun May 31 11:00:49 2015 UTC,"Watch for sales. You can find a decent set of scuba find (open heel) for <$50 new or a nice set for about that used.   If those dollar figures seem high then you are in for a shock when buying other gear. Shop around, look for deals, buy used if you can find gently used stuff.   A lot of people buy their initial gear and never dive again after checkout dives. Buy stuff from them. If you are in the US watch leisure pro, divers supply, and others for their weekly deals and close outs."
scuba,37vvd6,Doub1eAA,2,Sun May 31 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"I've scuba dived with freediving fins before. No big deal. Buddy's will complain about not being able to keep up with you, and you might chew through a bit more air (depending on the rigidity of the freediving fin in question), but you wont not be able to. They'll certainly get you out of trouble (eg. unexpected current, you'll actually be able to fight it).  I think the biggest issue will be the type of scuba diving you do. Boat dives, not a problem. Shore dives, closed heel freediving fins will be a pain in the arse to get on and off. When I shore dive with scuba, I like to wade into the water and put my fins on when im at about waist depth. Not an issue with open heel scuba fins and spring straps. Closed heel fins you really need to put on whilst sitting down. This is not an issue when freediving to put them on; you just sit down, put them on, get back up and walk backwards into the water. Doing this with scuba gear is a massive pain in the ass."
scuba,37vvd6,cradossk,3,Sun May 31 11:07:52 2015 UTC,"The two types of fins are incompatible. Freediving fins are made to propel you only forward with as much efficiency as possible. The scuba diving kind is about control of movement at slow or no speed. Scuba is not about moving fast most of the time, it is about tiny corrections for precise positioning. Freediving is about getting there where you want to go fast and straight to the point."
scuba,37vvd6,texasguy911,3,Sat May 30 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"That's a bit exaggerated given that both are fins in the end, and also given the huge variety of scuba and freediving fins. I scuba dive with people who primarily go freediving or spearfishing a lot and to them it makes hardly a difference at all."
scuba,37vvd6,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-1,Sun May 31 20:58:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. In freediving fins you cannot execute stop. You cannot do a helicopter turn. You cannot back-fin (swim backwards).  Thus, the advice is right on. Evidently your friends are just sunday divers who don't have a clue how to do fine finning.  Freediving fins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hvkW6YOGGY  Scuba technique: Notice how many movements can a scubadiver do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-p7Pm0tSWM  The movie is a tad long but comprehensive. Yet, it shows in detail what is expected of a scuba diver skill wise. Hope it is clear that in freediving fins it would be impossible to do most fin techniques.   Thus, think of freediving fins as F1 sports car. Can go fast but bad turning. Best for highway or track driving. The scubadiving fins are like a Porsche, can go fast but great at cornering. Best for city driving.  I'd recommend dive right fins for scuba (in black): https://www.divegearexpress.com/dive-rite-xt-fins"
scuba,37vvd6,texasguy911,3,Mon Jun 1 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"In freediving fins you cannot execute stop. You cannot do a helicopter turn. You cannot back-fin (swim backwards).   I can't do that with my scuba split fins either. Not everyone needs to be able to do that. And yeah, it's clear that a compromise will always have some drawbacks.   Evidently your friends are just sunday divers who don't have a clue how to do fine finning.   Yeah, sure. People who successfully freedive in the open ocean on a weekly basis, and who go spearfishing in shark infested waters are clearly sunday divers with absolutely no clue. Facepalm.  Look, it's obvious that freediving fins aren't optimal for standard scuba diving. But saying it's impossible and they are ""incompatible"" sounds like snobby nonsense coming from the kind of people who show up on a dive boat with 5 pairs of fins for every half knot of current they might encounter."
scuba,37vvd6,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-2,Mon Jun 1 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"Not everyone needs to be able to do that.   Everyone. But not everyone has a tenacity to learn. It is like skating on ice skates. Tell me you don't need to learn to stop when skating. Ah, I'll just grab to stationary objects or people.. No. You either are graceful underwater or you are not. If you are telling me you don't need to be, ok. Be that person.   And those people on the boat that have right tools for special occasions are not crazy. They know the difference that you are ignorant of. They took time to learn. I commend them for that. Don't make fun of knowledge."
scuba,37vvd6,texasguy911,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:53:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. You must dive 20 kg jetfins from the 80s, otherwise you can't be a ""graceful"" diver. Don't be silly.  Split fins aren't optimal for frog kicks, helicopters, etc., but that doesn't mean it's impossible to use them for those kind of things. Just like it isn't impossible to scuba dive with freediving fins, or indeed to freedive with scuba fins.   And those people on the boat that have right tools for special occasions are not crazy   Someone who thinks he needs five pairs of fins because they would otherwise be incapable of diving is crazy.  If your learning didn't include how to use non-optimal gear then you're not a safe diver. Because when the shit hits the fan you won't be able to quickly ascend from 40 meters to get your other pair of fins or whatever other gizmo it is that you can't dive without."

LOL.  come on, man.  not everyone is tech diving and not everyone is into DIR. if you primarily dive warm, open water reefs will being able to backfin and helicopter turn make you a better diver... absolutely.  are you automatically a crap diver if you can't backfin and helicopter turn... nope. it's a big world, there are a lot of different kinds of ""right""."

Here are some tips:   If you aren't already, make sure you get nitrox certified before you go.  You can easily do 3-4, even 5 dives a day that way. The Salt Pier is an awesome awesome dive.  The island requires that you have a DM lead you on that dive though, so just make sure you arrange that. Night diving is great in Bonaire too.  Plan for that. Hard soled booties are good to have.  Most of the entries are pretty rocky. Make sure you can drive a stick shift.  The rental truck that you'll drive to each site will probably be manual transmission."

scuba,37u7ji,ProbablyNarcd,1 point,Sat May 30 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, diving the salt pier is great. There's a number you can call to see if it's ok to dive (no ships). The shops should have the number. Oil slick leap is a fun one if you're up for it.  Pretty much anywhere is a good dive, though. Just drive down the road and look for the yellow rocks. It should probably go without saying, but everything is reachable from the shore. The only reason I mention it is because I've seen the look of shock on the faces of people on a dive boat as they see us enter from the shore and swim out to the same site they paid to be at.  That said, for a non-diving day, definitely consider a half-day drift snorkel on the Woodwind. They take you out to Klien Bonaire on a great catamaran and lead a three-leg drift around the island. The third one is always packed with turtles. Dee and the crew are fantastic. The kite beach is fun to visit on a busy day and watch the guys go nuts.  For food, we like Bobbejans BBQ. It's only open weekends for dinner but has great ribs (and I don't normally like ribs).  Also, as others have mentioned, you really need hard-soled boots. The beaches are coral, not sand, and you can hurt your feet/roll your ankle without much effort. Much easier for entering from the shore, too."

scuba,37ozqu,MasherusPrime,5,Fri May 29 08:23:01 2015 UTC,"Looks more like 50 ft than 50 m (180 ft) due to the brightness, right?"

Edit: I think the video white balance greatly is enhanced. No colors and the reflections from cylinder look like the sun."
scuba,37ozqu,MasherusPrime,2,Fri May 29 16:43:31 2015 UTC,Ok... I've also never been lucky enough to dive anywhere that you can just wear shorts and no wet suit to 180 feet. Kind of changes my perspective.
scuba,37ozqu,rebo2,3,Fri May 29 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"In warm waters the water mixes so much that there is not much difference in depth temp wise. Thus, I'd say it is conceivable that at 200 feet the water to be still warm enough for trunks. Specifically Gulf Stream, it pretty much the same temp any depth.  However, I don't think they went to 180 feet on a single tank. That is dumb. How long can you spend on the bottom? 1-2 mins max, then you'll need so much air to decompress, one tank might not be enough.  A diver breathing air at a depth of around 200 ft is exposed to an oxygen partial pressure of 1.5 ata. CNS toxicity is a limiting factor and a very real danger in deep diving since it can cause a diver to convulse and/or become unconscious with little or no warning."

Bottom Left (to left of ""28""):  blank.  If the dive computer was in Nitrox mode (even if diving on Air/21%), it would say ""OLF"" here - - since it is blank, it means that the dive computer is on its ""AIR"" setting and which logically means that they're doing this dive on air, so their PPO2 would be 1.36 ATM.

Anyway, assume an instant descent to make the dive be ""3 minutes at 6.5 ATM"" square, which would have meant that the air consumed so far probably would have been around (1.25)(3)(6.5) = 24 cubic feet ... which if from a generic 3000psi AL80 would mean 31% consumed (-300psi/minute), and a remaining gage pressure that's a shade above 2,000psi.    While this is just right at turning point per simplified Rule of Thirds, the real catch is twofold:   (a)  he's got over a five (5) minute ascent at 30ft/min to get up shallow to start his required Deco, which will burn down another ~20ft3 (-800psi) before he gets there, and (b) for a good portion (~1/2) of this ascent, he's still be deep enough to be adding to his controlling compartments, so the required deco will still be increasing.  The question then becomes if he can finish the Deco stops with the ~1300psi remaining by the time he gets up to 20fsw, which will depend on two things.  The first is relaxing to get his SAC down, and the second is to understand that on a Suunto, mandatory Deco stops really need to be done at 10-11fsw instead of the 10-19fsw (~15fsw) depth window permitted for Safety Stops...doing the stop deeper than 10fsw will lengthen the stop (and this is not really well illustrated/documented on the Vyper): for example,it might take ~90 seconds to clear each 60 seconds of required deco stop if the hang's at 15-17ftsw instead of at 10-11fsw."

Now, we'd seen reef sharks around the place but they mostly kept to themselves. Our DM reaches into his BCD and produces a bottle, and then proceeds to fill it with air from his occy. He then makes proceeds to start crunching it (like in that video).   Ill tell ya what.... in open water, 20 metres from cover, it went from 0 sharks to about 10 sharks materializing out of the abyss in a very small amount of time. I felt rather exposed to say the least.   It definitely works.   Edit: the DM also had a shark shield activated when he was doing this... ill tell you what; i was skeptical of the old shark shield until I saw it in action against the sharks coming in to investigate the bottle..."
scuba,37ozqu,texasguy911,1 point,Fri May 29 10:21:58 2015 UTC,"So the shark shield worked enough to keep them away from touching him, but didn't scare them out of the area?"
scuba,37ozqu,texasguy911,8,Fri May 29 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't scare sharks away as in ""scare"". All it does is adds some additional perception to their senses that tells them that their usual prey doesn't have this electric pulsing, thus, you must be something else entirely and not someone on their menu. Imagine, as a hunter, seeing a deer in the woods that lights up (glows) from inside, surely you wouldn't think it is a regular deer, you'll be like - WTF??. Shark Shield does the same, it just adds strong electric impulses that a shark cannot ignore. Whether it will make a correct decision if you are a prey or not (being a weirdo creature that sends pulses), that is entirely up to the shark. Thus, the shield will work only on sane and fed sharks. If it is angry, very hungry, or just mental, it may choose to ignore the pulses and go after you nevertheless, of cause, in very rare cases, nevertheless, a real possibility. Fish, animals, etc, can be out of their minds too.  Thus, the Shark Shield is not a weapon. It is mostly a waving flag saying to the shark that you are not their regular dinner by surrounding you with an additional sensory stimuli for sharks to detect.   In addition, since with that shield you really light up on their radar, surely the sharks will be more pressed to come and investigate. Probably they'd keep a distance, just in case, but can you really trust a shark? Would you stay away if you noticed a glowing deer?    Tests: http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2012/06/20/3529306.htm  ""In South Australia we found that the shark shield didn't impact the proportion of bait being consumed,"" Dr Huveneers said.  Dr Huveneers said they observed that sharks generally kept a little further away from the baits when the shields were activated, but were also seen within 50 cm of an activated unit.  ""They are physically capable of being in close proximity to an operational shark shield."""

Mix it with water around you, tada! If a shark won't attack you full speed, but will swim near by, it would really get hurt by soap (it will affect its gills, pain and poor oxygen absorption). Not saying it is a great idea that works well 100% or it is safe for marine life... No. But this is the only home remedy that I read off that can give the shark the runs. Thus, just bringing it up because we are talking about replants."

scuba,37ozqu,quizbuk,1 point,Fri May 29 20:51:35 2015 UTC,"I thought so too. Then I went to Bimini, have seen only small reef sharks. Then on the last dive (I was diving sidemount and had extra air than others), I stayed. Before everyone went up, 2 reef sharks about 8 feet arrived. So, divers looked at them, then when they were low on air they left. I decided to stay (I was diving solo the whole trip). So, one of the sharks was coming circling me, like 5-6 circles, then leaving. Then coming back again. I felt kind of out of my comfort zone, alone with 1:2 ratio, not in my favor, bigger sharks than I am, one of them really interested in me. Well, I decided to get the f-k out of the water even thought it was the last dive, I have another hour of air, before the dive I did ask permission to stay way longer. So, all of the sudden it was too much of shark for me. Then when I came out, the divemaster (girl), she was like, oh, they are so cute, the one with a hook is named blah, blah, blah. I don't know, I guess, I did not feel the connection.  I blame movie Jaws. It screwed up a whole generation of people with additional fears. Wouldn't it be for that movie, perhaps, people would have had a same (lesser) fear factor when they watch barracudas but attributed to sharks. Somehow, in my childhood, Poltergeist and Jaws were the most memorable movies for me. When I grew up, I got over Poltergeist as irrational fear.

There was an abalone diver killed in SA a few years ago by two whites who was wearing two shark shields. Didn't do him much good at all.   The Sharks I saw it up against were black tip reef sharks and nurse sharks, which do rely more using their ampullae of lorenzini. It disrupts that sensory organ in the same way a bright light would disrupt your eyes, but only within a small radius of the device (I think it's 5 metres). But like how we can close our eyes, they can turn off their ampullae of lorenzini.   Some sharks also lack ampullae of lorenzini (such as 7 gills), so a shark shield is as ineffective against them as it is against us."

I'm not an expert at all, but don't try this without proper knowledge. You basically might make yourself seem like a wounded fish to the sharks.

That said the Sharks have to be around to hear it isn't the first place.   Fwiw, the trick is half air, half water but with bottle half crushed. Then roll it in your hands or scrunch it about so it makes a nice crunchy noise. Also - tie the bottle to your bcd in case it gets away from you and suddenly you're littering the ocean."

The town is built around diving and angling so you'll have plenty of options. We usually stay here: http://www.tritondiving.co.za/. Conditions here are pretty reliable and viz is usually around 20 metres or more.  For sharks you can go to Aliwal Shoal and Protea Banks - both pretty famous for sharks. I haven't done this dive but I hear the conditions can change very quickly one dive might be the best of your life and the next one not great at all.  Cape Town is good for diving but the water is around the 11 - 15 degree C range. There are lots of wrecks and reefs but for larger sea life look at doing a dive with the seals and the cow sharks - http://www.piscesdivers.co.za/ (and others) launch their boat for those sites several times a week.  There is also the option for doing a cage dive to see Great Whites from Gansbaai.  You'll be here around the time of the Sardine Run - look it up, it could be amazing. You'll also be here in winter so the weather topside might be a bit colder than you like and Cape Town can get winter storms pushing through making conditions more suitable for big wave surfing than diving."

scuba,37ninf,Chosen1Khaled,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:13:21 2015 UTC,I used a Gopro 3 black no filter.  Simple setting no post production changes.
scuba,37l6y6,SpecialKofLifting,2,Thu May 28 12:58:55 2015 UTC,I would highly suggest getting a red lens. Check out the backscatter setup. It has different lenses for different depths. The deeper you go in water the more red light you lose giving everything a blue appearance.

scuba,37l6y6,phorkor,2,Thu May 28 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience you will get better results with post processing in software. As seen in the replies here already, sometimes you need red, sometimes magenta, and different levels of red for different depths, etc.  What all this means, is probably rarely will you have exactly the right amount and shade of red for your conditions. Check out /r/gopro or /r/underwaterphotography and you'll find recent posts of people looking for info on how to correct for too much red.   GoPro Cineform Studio will do color correction.  Get it free from gopro.com. Lightroom or a number of other programs can do color correction as well. When you are working in software you can adjust levels precisely for your particular conditions.  Filters also reduce the amount of light that makes it to your sensor.  Especially underwater where light is already getting filtered, cutting out more light getting to your sensor can reduce image quality.   The best thing about a filter is that, if it works, it is easy. If you can get ""close enough"" where a little too red or not quite enough red still looks better than no filter at all, then maybe you get something that looks ""ok"" right from the camera. But since you don't want to inflict 2 minutes of boring shaky video on your viewers to get to the 30 seconds of interesting bits, you'll be using an editing suite anyway right?  Might as well post process."
scuba,37l6y6,RedToby,1 point,Sun May 31 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"Also, be sure that red is the right color for the water you will be diving.  I dive in the Pacific Northwest (Puget Sound), and have a magenta filter for the green water."

scuba,37l6y6,kroneksix,1 point,Sat May 30 10:46:13 2015 UTC,"I have a few lenses, to be honest the ones that go over the front of the gopro can trap air bubbles and have ruined a few great shots, id recommend the cheaper little red lens you put inside the camera housing.  If anyone has any insight, please let me know as well."
scuba,37l6y6,lookitskeith,1 point,Thu May 28 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Basically any filter for any camera will do that, best way is to attach filter under water.

Check out those guys, thats what i use http://www.backscatter.com/  Also it depends where you dive, basic rule is, blue water use red filter, green (like east coast Atlantic) use magenta.  But still for best picture you will need some kind of light"
scuba,37l6y6,olegkaplun,1 point,Thu May 28 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"A red lens is good for blue water, if you dive green water (such as Puget Sound) you can use use a magenta lens for the appropriate correction.

scuba,37odzg,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Fri May 29 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"Why are you doing your OW dives in a cave?  If you're worried about losing contacts when doing mask skills, get a prescription mask. You should be comfortable keeping your eyes, without a mask, under water.    I dove with someone who needed a prescription mask but refused to get one and didn't like diving with contacts and it was awful. He had so many problems that wouldn't have existed if he just spent the cash on a better mask. He probably would have enjoyed everything about diving a lot more than he did."
scuba,37odzg,misplacedyank,1 point,Fri May 29 10:44:07 2015 UTC,The place I bought the course through owns Bonne Terre mine in Missouri so that is where they do their training. I see what your saying and my boss who is also a dover agrees that a prescription mask will be good for cutting down on unnecessary possible issues as a first time diveR. But I also see what the last poster is saying about what if I lose my mask. Even though I don't think contacts work very well for underwater use it might be better than my natural eyes with a -8.50 prescription.
scuba,37odzg,wow_such_dog,1 point,Fri May 29 17:20:15 2015 UTC,I said screw it and bought prescription lenses. One of the best decisions that I've made because I have absolutely 0 concerns.

It took them 23 hours from the time that I placed the order to the time that I had the box on my doorstep and I live in Seattle which is on the complete opposite side of the country.
scuba,37odzg,Doub1eAA,1 point,Fri May 29 14:56:35 2015 UTC,I wear contacts. Certified back when I wore monthly toric lenses. Recently switched to dailies at my doctors urging.

scuba,37mmbv,kungfudiver,2,Thu May 28 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"One of these years, I really need to stay on Grand Cayman long enough to get in some dives there...  For transporation, I'd just rent a car.  I've rented from CICO Avis a couple of times over the years while we've had long airport layovers (to/from Cayman Brac).    For the dive sites you mentioned, Eden Rock & Devil's Grotto are roughly a half mile up the road from Sunset .. too long pragmatically to swim (or walk).    Babylon is Northside (& East End) ... a pretty long ways by boat from the SW corner where Sunset is.  It is also a wall dive, so its distance offshore makes it generally considered to only be a boat dive.  The Kittawake ... because its off of 7mi beach and the ""New Attraction"", I'd expect that all of the local dive operations (including Sunset) are offering a boat trip there - - and it will probably be pre-planned (eg, ""we go there every Wednesday"" or whatever).      EDIT:  more thoughts.  For the Turtle Farm - - I've not been to the new one (eg, post-IVAN), but the original was simple/quaint and pretty much just an afternoon excursion.  Of course, it also only cost CI$5 back then, too.  For shore dive compatible dive sites (eg, Eden Rock, Devil's Grotto), I'd probably look at doing these on my own (with a rental car) as an afternoon shore dive ... try to use your 2-tank AM boat dives for a Wall dive & reef that's further from home.  For beaches ... watch the sun & use plenty of sunscreen.      Finally, if you're heading down anytime soon, do be aware that the rains have started and the mosquitos have been pretty brutal this year - - it seems that they got a late jump on their supression (especially on Cayman Brac & Little Cayman).  And as of last week, water temp's were around 82-83F.  Haven't downloaded the dive computer yet to be more definitive.  -hh"

scuba,37mmbv,paul09339,1 point,Thu May 28 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"Do the Kittiwake, its worth doing if its your first time to the island. Lots of good macro but you need a keen eye/magnifying glass/good guide and sometime eagle rays and southern sting rays swimming past. Decent fun swimming through it.  Babylon is waaay over on the north side, its nice, especially for photographers. Lots of sponges and soft corals, but not a lot of life. Idk if Sunset go there, maybe do a day with one of the east end operators. The east end walls are much more spectacular and good possibility of shark action on the corner dives.   Devils grotto and eden will be easy.   Try and go to the north wall if you cant get to the east side, some good diving there.  Do 4 dives a day if you can, then have a few days exploring and on the beach. The botanical gardens will be nice this time of year, as well rum point/sting ray city.   Rent a car, its a small island they are all the same except perhaps andys car rentals which are a bit cheaper.   Dont go to the turtle factory or the dolphin prison, thats for fat cruise shippers who think that its exciting. Go see something in the wild... also dont eat anything not in season and then wonder why there arent any fish on the reef.   Source: Used to work there as a DI"

Kittiwake is doable from Sunset House, but Babylon is on the other side of the island. For that, I would call DiveTech. But you would need a ride up to West Bay to catch the boat.  Renting a car is the best way to go. Cabs will get pretty spendy, and they aren't fond of wet dive gear.  Near the Turtle Farm is a dive spot (Macabuca) that always has a school of tarpon that are pretty fun to swim with.  I haven't done much diving in the East End.

There are so many dive shops in south Florida that this happens more often than you think.   Also, as far as tipping - are you supposed to tip the instructor? The boat crews on both days?    Generally- yes- you would tip the instructor and boat crew.  I'll tip the boat crew if they're friendly and helpful ($5/tank or so)- but for classes where you're expected to change your own equipment and things I don't know what the ""rule"" is.  Instructor tips would depend on how much you like them- i.e. how effective you consider the training you got, and so on. 10% is pretty common- going up or down from there depending on what you thought of the instruction you received."

As far as tips go, there should be a tip jar on the boat.  Ask the divemaster or your instructor about it.  $5 per tank is the general rule of thumb, but I've tipped more for better crews.

The instructor is the only guy in town and he runs the dive shop. I went in not expecting to tip because I knew I was going to spend a bunch of money at the shop (and still plan on spending even more there).  I also took my cert through a university class, which certainly differs from the norm and probably includes things like poor college kids being more unable to tip than non-college kids.

Also means we check off the skills quickly and they get to (and I get to observe them) actually dive for the duration of the dive."
scuba,37cl7y,franklin_stubbs,1 point,Wed May 27 19:57:41 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I've very rarely had any students not remember their skill signals. Occasionally I'll have to improvise a quasi-demonstration such as for the reg recovery method like you mentioned. I don't think using signals have ever impeded the flow or timing of a course even in cold (30-34 F) water. I don't like the idea of intentionally removing or even partially flooding my mask in open water because it can also be construed as a loss of control if a student has a problem at that moment.

I find that i'd rather wear my wet suit in those conditions because i get way more flexibility of movement.  (Like for grabbing onto wrecks and rocks as I whizz by them in the current)  to me, dry is more work, heavier to wear and provides less mobility, but is fantastic for a lake dive or a boat dive, like the kind you do anywhere in Toby."

There are also nice wrecks at more manageable depths however.   The Niagara II was purpose sunk for diving and starts at 40 feet (maximum depth is about 95) The James King is a big wooden barque that was hammer pretty hard but still makes a nice dive site. It runs down a ledge from 25 feet to 80 feet. The Sweepstakes (the site in the photo) sits in 20 feet of water but is a really nice wreck and an easy dive.

scuba,37eoaq,CanadianDiver,1 point,Wed May 27 02:40:05 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is exactly the answer I needed :D. All of my dives are no deco dives so it's handy to have that knowledge.
scuba,37eoaq,-hh,2,Wed May 27 10:00:07 2015 UTC,"All of my dives are no deco dives so it's handy to have that knowledge.   Yes, although ""No-Deco"" profiles (vs Deco profile) generally isn't really a factor.  Strictly speaking, all a dive computer is a machine which automatically keeps track of your dive profile (depth/time) rather than for you to have to do the same task manually.    Under pedantic conditions (same DCS model, same dive profile, etc), a dive computer should not give you any different results than the same dive on an old fashioned Table...which means the same dive duration.    But this never happens because ""pedantic"" conditions of a perfectly square profiles (etc) virtually never happen in Rec diving, as all profiles are ""multi-level"" to some degree.    What this means is that the main payoff (""Bang for the Buck"") of having a dive computer is for it to give you credit in a multi-level dive profile, manifested as a longer bottom time.      Analytically, if one were really so inclined, one could figure out your ""Cost per Minute"" of a dive with a table versus with a dive computer, and figure out how many dives it would take for the dive computer to pay for itself.  For example, assume a 2-tank AM diveboat trip which costs $100.  On Tables, assume that this trip would give you one deep 30 minute dive and one shallow 50 minute dive --> $100 for 80 minutes = $1.25/minute.  Then consider the same diveboat with a dive computer, which changes the allowed bottom times to 40 minutes & 60 minutes  ($100 for 100 minutes = $1.00/minute).  For you to have gotten 100 minutes of dive time on Tables would have taken (100min/80min) 1.25 trips, although its easier to run this as:  (Cost of 100 minutes on Tables) - (Cost of 100 minutes on Computer) =  ($125 - $100) = a difference in ""value"" of $25 per 2-tank AM diveboat trip.  So the time until notional ""payback"" for buying a $400 dive computer:  $400/($25 per 2-tank AM-diveboats) = 16 days worth of 2-tank AM diveboat trips.  Naturally, if you add more dives conducted per day, the number of notional days until 'breakeven' go down.  -hh"
scuba,37eoaq,-hh,1 point,Wed May 27 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the reason why I wrote up the ""analytical"" section the way I did was to illustrate another point:  Scenario #3: Consider the same diveboat, but with a fancy $800 dive computer...  The key question is if the more expensive dive computer really will give you a longer bottom time than a cheap one.   The short answer is probably not.   As such, the fancy computer doesn't justify its higher cost based on this criteria.      FWIW, the same sort of analysis can be done to quantify the benefits of Nitrox...both with & without a dive computer.  -hh"
scuba,37eoaq,nigelh,4,Wed May 27 14:05:52 2015 UTC,Gauge mode converts a computer into a dumb depth/time device. Basically it converts the expensive lump into a cheap lump. It's there for technical wannabes who consider a computer beneath their dignity because they can deco-plan in their heads.

My computer does all of that. /u/nigelh isn't suggesting you don't plan a dive carefully (taking into account gas planning, a deco schedule/runtime, and CNS loading). He's talking about then taking that computer down and ignoring it to run a table.  I've never understood the absolute faith people have in dive tables when they so rarely run the schedule they planned anyway. ""I'm going to descend to 200 feet, stay there for exactly 20 minutes without moving up or down at all, and then head up to the surface and follow the deco stops specified on my tables"".  Your computer knows what you did, not what you planned. There are people that can and will run a table very precisely. I get down to a wreck and I'm going to explore. It won't be a square profile so why should I dive a table based on one? That's even more important with trimix.  I want my computer to get me safely to my 30' stop and then I'll add in extra deco because I'm not ongassing at that point and I like the idea of large safety margins. I have my tables as a backup- and I practice with them- but unless something on both my computers doesn't jive with the tables- I'm diving the computer profile most of the time."

You can do all that with a technical dive computer. Since you're using a recreational computer as a backup- are you ignoring your primary computer to run the tables? (Obviously if you don't have a primary tech computer this is a moot point.)   I'm using a computer in gauge and not because I'm doing shit in my head... it's because I don't want to get bent.   May I ask why you think the tables you created are going to be a more accurate representation of the dive than the computer that was with you?  The only time I ever dove a perfectly square profile was when we hot dropped on a wreck during a training dive and missed it due to much stronger midwater currents than expected. Ended up on the bottom nowhere near the wreck and decided to just look around instead and run our profile.

From what I understand most really deep divers are running tables though especially for bounce dives.   I, however, a cost locked into using v-planner and a bottom timer atm. The gauge setting allows me to use my rec computer as a backup bottom timer in case my primary fails.  Eventually Ill be purchasing a tec computer but it's currently backlogged behind thousands of dollars of other things I can't afford.

scuba,37evwc,doombuggy110,2,Wed May 27 02:59:10 2015 UTC,No- the Petrel doesn't support 100/100. No one in their right mind would dive 100/100. Set your computer to 30/85 or something and follow your tables. That should be well within the computers limits unless you run a perfectly square profile or exceed your limits (depth or time). If the Petrel says you need more deco- then I wouldn't second guess it.
scuba,37evwc,stds9tng,1 point,Wed May 27 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"So, maybe I don't understand what I'm asking of it. I would have a VPM B profile on my slate. The whole team dives that. If something goes wrong, I need an aggressive deco that would get me up to ~65' fastest and then do a usual Buhlmann deco, but I would have the option to extend it if I decided I wanted to be a little safer, which the computer would have no problem with.   Idea being that the computer will not keep track/plan for my missed deco if I blow past, say, a 120', 100', 90', 75' stop and go straight to 65'. But it'll work out if I hang out at my first stop around 65' for twice as long."
scuba,37evwc,stds9tng,3,Wed May 27 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"If something goes wrong   Plan your dive so that if something goes- wrong- it's no big deal.   I need an aggressive deco that would get me up to ~65' fastest and then do a usual Buhlmann deco, but I would have the option to extend it if I decided I wanted to be a little safer,   Decompression does not work like this. You have fast compartments and slow compartments. As far as I know- deep stops are about allowing the fast compartments to off gas. You can't just ""skip"" them and make it up shallower. Since the fast compartments are associated with Type II DCS- I would never want to skip them.   which the computer would have no problem with.    The Petrel is not a beginners dive computer. It doesn't really care what you do. If you miss a deco stop- all it's going to do is warn you an try to extend your other stops to compensate. It's not going to lock up and refuse to let you dive like some sort of petulant child. The problem is- those deeper stops are there for a reason. The Petrel will do it's best to get you back up safely- but if you blow them off- there may not be anything the computer can do to help.  Frankly- 50/90 is already a very very aggressive deco schedule and not one I would ever feel comfortable diving unless it was literally a life or death choice.  Have you completed a decompression procedures class? Because these are the sort of topics that should be covered there.  Also: If you're not already using it you should select @+5 as one of the options for the center row on your Petrel. That will let you know you TTS if you stay 5 more minutes at your current depth. It's an incredibly handy feature."
scuba,37evwc,stds9tng,1 point,Wed May 27 04:50:17 2015 UTC,"Again, I think there's a basic misunderstanding here. I'm sure it's my fault.  I am well past my deco class. My instructor, a well-respected tech instructor and diver, likes to dive with two plans. The normal, VPM B +2 plan on the slate so that the team is all together. Then an ""oh crap, I have a sucking chest wound/my buddy has a sucking chest wound and we need to get up."" plan. After all, what makes a great tech diver is to expect the unexpected and have a plan. So, he likes to dive a 100/100 Buhlmann model. That way, if he gets to a decent depth and he's thinking a little more clearly and sees that maybe it's not a SUCKING chest wound, he can take a little longer on the deco, but the 100/100 will still, technically, get you up with sub-clinical DCS.  http://imgur.com/a/YlFJu this is the sort of thing I'm talking about. That's my usual deco model and then the emergency. The one on my Petrel would be for the absolute worst case scenario. It's like airbags. I sure hope I never have to use it, but if I do, I'll be glad it's there for me.   I'll keep that in mind. Honestly, I've been using another computer for my other deco dives and I've decided to try this one I'd been using for non-deco since it's so so so highly recommended."

It will tell you how close to the Buhlmann line you're getting. If it says 99%- you're essentially diving with 99/99 Gradient Factors. If it says 107%- you've exceeded the limits :)  Edit: See this page:  https://www.shearwater.com/frequently-asked-questions/  And go to the section ""What does the “GF99” display value mean?""  ""In extreme conditions, decompression risk can be traded for operational risk by using the GF99 display. For example, in a low-gas situation or perhaps a bailout or injury, you may want to get to the surface faster, but not blow off all the remaining decompression stops. You could then violate the stop displayed by the Predator, and decide to follow a more aggressive GF99, say 95%. This will get you out of the water faster, at a higher risk of decompression sickness, while still remaining within some limits. Upon resurfacing, appropriate action for omitted decompression should be followed such as rest, surface O2, monitoring symptoms and contacting DAN or other diving medicine center."""

Definitely read the ShearWater manual- it's chock full of useful information that people don't realize. For example- a lot of people think the ascent hash bars represent some sort of percentage of allowed ascent rate or something- but really each one just means you're ascending at 10' per minute. 6 hash marks would be 60 feet per minute.  And that's another useful thing to configure in MultiDeco.

If you really want to match your buddies, figure out which VPM-B conservancy factor they are using and run a few dives through Multi-Deco and compare them on VPM-B versus Bulhmann ... as I recall from a few years ago ... VPM-B on a +3 is about a 20/80. But don't quote me on that.  Or if you REALLY want, buy the VPM code for your Petrel and your plan will match exactly.  You cannot load you plan into the Petrel, you will still need to use your wrist slate for your primary and secondary plan, but your computer will follow the same plan if your times are good. If your timing is bad, the computer will always automatically update your deco plan.  I dive a Predator, but it is primarily a bottom timer than will let me plan a dive on it.

I would be able to stay at the stops longer to help myself out if I got up there and realized it wasn't as bad as I thought or something.

You'll have to confirm that you understand you missed your deco stop- but the computer will keep right on working.  As for the VPM-B versus Buhlmann- I'd pick one or the other and stick with it. If you like VPM- use it on your Petrel as well (buy the upgrade- $65 just is not that expensive compared to what it costs to go diving).

scuba,37bven,Itsacon,2,Tue May 26 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a busted depth sensor if ever there was one.  You pretty much did the right thing, I think: slowly ascend and stay at a safety stop level for as long as your air permits. This is pretty much what the manual says you should do.  As for repairs: if it was new in februari, you should have full warranty, so just contact the store where you purchased it."
scuba,37bven,-hh,1 point,Tue May 26 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a busted depth sensor if ever there was one.   Agreed.  My Suunto Vyper did this last fall.   I did try a freshwater soak at the time and it reduced the depth tranducer's error, but it didn't eliminate the problem.     After I got home, I soaked the pressure transducer port in a vinegar/water solution for a week and it seemed to be operating again properly ... but I had bought a new one in anticipation of it not being so.     Lo and behold, on my first dive this spring, on an easy ~90ft warmwater dive, it said that I had gone down to a mere 175fsw.     I forget just what it said at the surface .. probably around 80fsw or so, but because the gear was suspect and I had the new dive computer along to trust, I pretty much ignored it.   Later that afternoon, while sitting on the kitchen counter, it gave a beep and a scream as it apparently had decided that it could no longer calculate the required deco for ~4.5 hours at ~80fsw, and ended up showing this screen, which went away sometime after 48 hours.  At this point, becaduse I know that the old one is years out of any warranty, I just plan to canibalize it for a few parts (for spares) and then toss it into the electronics recycling bin.  -hh"
scuba,37bven,Itsacon,1 point,Tue May 26 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"Just thinking out loud/thinking through this further...in the future I'm inclined to bring a non-electronic depth gauge (along with a new/repaired computer), wear a watch, and be more vigilant about planning my dive beforehand instead of robotically following my computer.  Had I done that, I might have comfortably and safely salvaged a portion of the dive."
scuba,37bven,MasherusPrime,1 point,Tue May 26 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"For this reason I have a normal depth gauge on my console that shows max depth. In this case (broken depth sensor) you can still get a reasonable dive time from the computer, but bringing a watch and planning your dive is always good practice.  Just remember that you should already have a backup: Your buddy. In this case (three people, failure at start of dive), ascending immediately alone is ok, although your buddy should hang around and see if you surface safely. Should the error occur later in the dive, you might need his data to figure out if you have a ceiling, and how long you've been under (to determine residual nitrogen time for a follow-up dive)  I actually don't have a computer right now, so I'm diving on watch and tables, and as you say: Planning your dive is very important. It's interesting to compare data between my info and my buddy, who does have a comp."

After working in Malaysia for a season I went to Scotland for uni and found work there doing a mixture of scuba and offshore maritime survival training. The pay was pretty nice for a student job (~£10/hour). Now back in Asia and not diving as regularly as I'd like...
scuba,37cjl2,take_whats_yours,2,Wed May 27 05:02:12 2015 UTC,"Wh do you think you are not diving as regularly as you would like? Is it because there are not a lot of jobs going for the number of Instructors (or Assistants or DMs) in general, or specifically in your area? What is the pay like, compared to the living wage in the area where you are? Sorry for so many questions!"
scuba,37cjl2,ithinkimanoyou,1 point,Wed May 27 09:55:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have been more clear. I'm not working as an AI anymore, moved to IT. My only diving is fun diving when I can get over to perhentian or tioman from KL. In KL itself there a few centres doing pool training but they have to drive over the country on weekend for OW training. I help out in the pool occasionally but that's it.  I did work as a DM in Perhentian back in 2009 so I can give some advice. In SE Asia it's customary to train and hire local DMs and foreign instructors. I got my job after my DMT because I was already familiar with the island, centres and sites. Multiple languages are a plus and almost an unwritten necessity for foreigners.   Even as an OWSI, you're not looking at huge wages. Enough to keep you going day to day, and generally accomodation is provided on the islands, but you won't be saving anything and even saving up for flights home can be tricky. Generally western dms/instructors are hired without proper employment visas and paid under the table, requiring the famous visa run every few months (drive over the border, u-turn, come back). This means centres can be fairly loose with contracts etc.  Bear in mind dive sites in SE Asia are generally far from cosmopolitan civilisation so don't expect proper medical coverage or anything. Your costs will amount to food, drinking and travel  Don't be put off though. Come out for a season or a year and see what's going. There's a reason I've made this part of the world my permanent base"

Couldn't really ask for a better boss. We were contracted out to the 4 centres (falck nutec, rgit petrofac, maersk and survivex) during the week to do safety diving and survival training and on Fridays and weekends we ran pool sessions and OW dives. Mostly at the quarry. Are you familiar with the famed site?"

It was such a cash cow for the centre. Jason got something like £70 per hour per diver at each centre, and paid us less than £10. You do the maths. Falck was always the worst. Hated the summer I spent there. I feel sorry for the new guys up there every day.  Never ran into someone I (probably) know on reddit before this is weird.

scuba,37cjl2,Pungtunch_da_Bartfox,2,Thu May 28 08:00:10 2015 UTC,"I am an Advanced Nitrox Instructor in Greece. I have a normal day job, and being an instructor is a part-time job in the afternoon and in the Weekends.  In Greece we have a touristic season (Usually starts mid - April and ends about mid - October). So for a full-time instructor that is the season where you have to make the years salary, because on the winter the divers and the lessons you are going to have are minimal.  Due to the crisis, the salary has fallen dramatically. Most Dive Centers will give something like 600 euros for a DM and 900 for an Instructor per month (which is a little bit better than the minimum wage). Many Dive Centers in touristic resorts they will offer a place to stay and food for reduced salary. Other Dive Centers will be on a scheme on how many divers you certify or lead in a dive and get a small percentage of the payment (Usually is about 30% of the fee).  For a dive center (or a professional on the second payment scheme) to make a living it usually makes a lot of Discover Scuba Diving (or Scuba Experience) in a day. This is the service which is most profitable.   Unfortunately you can't save any money with these wages, but with the unemployment that Greece has this moment, someone is lucky in Greece if he makes the above kind of money.  You are getting better money if you own a dive center, or if you provide specialized work, like an scuba instructor and a sailing host in a liveaboard.   For me is ok, because I get my main salary from the day job (as a programmer) and the something extra I get from diving. Full-time instructors in Greece either they work abroad in the winter (Thailand, Egypt, ...) or they go into commercial diving or they become ski instructors in the winter.  Hope I answered some of your questions."
scuba,37bj1b,zedXable,7,Tue May 26 12:21:33 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you dive. Diving in tropical waters: not that different (from a feeling point of view) from 10-20m. However, things to consider are among others the risk of nitrogen narcosis, tissues that saturate waaaaay faster (so you'll see a very short no deco limit for those dives), and you'll be going through your gas supply pretty damn quickly.  Diving in cold (lower visibility) waters, it's a whole different story. You'll have the things I mentioned above, plus: it'll be colder (likely just 4 degrees Celsius) and darker (a lamp is an absolute must from 15m down). For warm water dives it's nothing new, really, but I've seen plenty of stressed out deep students when venturing into the deep in cold waters."
scuba,37bj1b,nl_the_shadow,6,Tue May 26 12:34:13 2015 UTC,"Feels like diving...  In the Great Lakes, most of the nicest shipwrecks are below 100 feet so when you start getting a lot of dives under your belt and more importantly you learn to do them safely - recreational depths really don't seem too deep.  There are a few factors that are important considerations ...  First, an aluminium 80 is really not the appropriate tank for most divers when you are breaching the 100 foot mark and beyond. They simply do not have enough gas to execute a dive and maintain a good safety margin. At the very least, you should be diving with a redundant air supply ... and no, your 3 cuft Spare Air is not adequate.  Second, you have narcosis. We all get narc'd - everyone. Anyone who says they don't is either lying or doesn't know they are narc'd - and that is worse. The effects of narcosis are different for everyone. The more comfortable you are in the water, the less likely you are going to experience a dark narc ... but too much euphoria isn't good either. The more you dive, the better you can manage the buzz.  Third is your general skill level. You need to be a competent diver. You need to have a good grasp on your buoyancy and be ready to solve any problem that comes up. Practice you air sharing regularly, practice swimming without a mask, practice all those skills from your Open Water course and be able to perform them without thinking about it. Practice your free ascents! Practice your free ascents ... PRACTICE YOUR FREE ASCENTS! You should be able to ascend from 130 feet, free in the water column. No visual reference other than your computer, and you should be able to do the ascent stress free.  And lastly ... pick a good buddy. Don't dive deep with someone you don't know well as a diver."
scuba,37bj1b,CanadianDiver,4,Tue May 26 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"The effects of nitrogen narcosis begin to become more apparent below 30m, but aside from that you won't feel any different than you do at 19m."

Shaking like a leaf, blowing through his air and making weird noises. This guy was 6'4"" and well built, and I'm an average size woman with not much upper body strength. But he kept making the ok sign and waving me off to show he was fine. I lifted his face to check what was happening as he wasn't making eye contact with me and it turned out this guy was absolutely howling with laughter down there. Narced off his tits. Had to drag him up to a higher point to sober him up and stop him running out of air.   That was his advanced open water course. He went on to be my DMT and do the deep dive spec to 40m.

Feeling the euphoria of narcosis can often lead to forgetting to check your meters.  A good computer alarm setup can help too.    I don't want to sound doomsday or anything, 40m is a safe rec dive depth, but it can affect different people differently. Stay on your game!"
scuba,37bj1b,oddible,2,Tue May 26 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I talked about this with a fellow diver recently.    What does it feel like going 200kph compated to 150kph?  Generally, not much, and I found the same to be true for diving at 40m.    You are more likely to get narc'd the deeper you go, but if you're not prone to it, it's only just a number on your dive computer.  Of course there are things to take into consideration while diving deep, but in warm waters with plenty of vis, you won't really notice a different, other than a potential physiological one."
scuba,37bj1b,isaacandnicole,1 point,Tue May 26 13:51:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on the viz.   In the clear Caribbean its not much different than 60 feet.   In the cold Atlantic it is dark and spooky.

scuba,37bj1b,jdb888,1 point,Tue May 26 12:35:37 2015 UTC,Buoyancy is way easier. It's darker. You have a feeling that you need to put on your serious face because the margins are smaller. If you're not using trimix you'll be distinctly narced.
scuba,37bj1b,Badekar,1 point,Tue May 26 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"With a good reg, It feels exactly like being at 10m.  If you're in a freshwater lake, it will be somewhere between slightly and tremendously darker and/or colder.  It's significantly more dangerous because:   You run out of air much faster You run out of no-deco time much faster You're a lot dumber due to narcosis. Even though you're still within the ""no deco"" zone, popping up to the surface at more than the recommended ascent rate becomes a significant risk. This means that ""crap I'm out of air with no buddy!"" means you're out of air for several minutes, not just a few seconds. Without good gas planning, you and your buddy won't have enough gas to make a safe air-sharing ascent if one of you runs out of air.   These conspire to turn trivial problems into significant dangers if you're not at the top of your game with a good plan.  It's not hugely dangerous, but as you go deeper, the risks definitely increase and conspire with each other."
scuba,37bj1b,none_shall_pass,1 point,Tue May 26 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, things generally just get darker, colder and less fun the deeper you go.  The standard open water limit of roughly 60ft/20m is for safety, but generally that's where almost all the best diving is too."

Had to do multiple safety stops on the way back up, they had extra tanks tied to a line for us."
scuba,37bj1b,Starayo,1 point,Tue May 26 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"Let's paint the dark side first...  Diving is diving regardless of depth but the problems with deep mean that your escape route is compromised. Firstly you are compromised. Your poor old brain is lurching about full of dissolved nitrogen. It is working slower and can betray you by not seeing the problem and not remembering the solution. Your equipment is working harder. At 40 meters each breath takes five times as much gas from your tank and your regulators must deliver this. You have never tested them like this before and the gas is now more viscous so both the regulators and your lungs don't work as well. Then there is the problem of gas consumption. Overstaying your planned time eats into those reserves. It will probably be darker and it may be colder. Then there is the ascent which, despite you wanting to get back to the surface mustn't be too fast. If you don't have a line this will need care and no sharp 'heavy breathing' buoyancy fixes as you're watching the SPG. Ideally take a computer and watch the NDL time because if you don't have a gas 'budget' for decompression stops you don't really want to do them.  Conversely I'm a wreck nerd. A properly managed deep dive can take me to history I could never see elsewhere on Earth. A dive of my recent holiday took us to 38 meters and under the hull of a capsized battleship (Google the SMS Kronprinz Wilhelm) and allowed us to visit a gun turret that fired at Jutland, probably one of the greatest navel battle in history before the Aircraft Carrier rendered such things history."

Hate to end up somewhere and not be able to dive a wreck or interesti g place because you dont have it.  My 2 cents.
scuba,37bj1b,The-C-Word,1 point,Wed May 27 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"A deeper dive is just that- a deeper dive. It shouldn't really feel any different- just darker (unless you're in crystal clear waters anyway).  Buoyancy: Will be easier to control when deep because the pressure changes are smaller for the same vertical distance when you are deep versus shallow.  Wetsuit: Your wet suit will compress more and you will become more negative. It will also lose some of its warmth.  Gas: You will use gas faster. Not a big deal if you plan correctly or are a light breather (you will hit your NDL long before you run out of air if you are a comfortable diver with a good SAC rate).  Decompression: Because the NDLs are so short- it becomes much easier to get into decompression the deeper you go. Be mindful of it.  Self rescue: Becomes much more important. While it's possible to do a CESA from 80'- it's not something I want to try. Beyond 60' I want a buddy I can trust (though I would prefer redundant tanks). Beyond 100' I definitely want redundancy (tanks and regs). I dive sidemount so that I can grab two 80's off the boat and get redundancy without having to lug a bunch of tanks and manifolds with me.  Narcosis: Becomes a factor for some people starting at about 100'. I've been to 180' on air many times and never felt ""narc'd"" - but I've felt narc'd at 80' when I was fighting a current to tie into a wreck. CO2 is 20 to 200 times more narcotic than Nitrogen (depending on who you ask). Dive calmly and slowly and you can avoid the CO2 issue."
scuba,37bj1b,stds9tng,1 point,Wed May 27 05:47:20 2015 UTC,Air will start to feel much denser; and it will be (x5 exactly). The sensation is almost like you are sipping air at 40m rather than breathing it.

I did some self-assessment (timed myself tying knots, did a mindful check-in, a few other things) and did not appear to be narced to any detectable degree. Guys on the boat who did get narced were laughing about it, because it doesn't seem scary when it's warm and bright and you can shrug off the fact that if your gas cuts off and you can't find your buddy you are in serious danger.  On the other hand, with 7' viz and 45F bottom temps I've started to feel the beginnings of the ""paranoid and slightly incapacitated"" type of narcosis at 20m."

scuba,37c543,CanadianDiver,6,Tue May 26 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"If the water is as clear as you say it is, visibility at 100' shouldn't be an issue. With a metal detector, your chances of finding it are even better.  Since it's not insured, I would definitely spend the $75/hour fee for a couple hours. It's worth a shot and at the end of the day you can at least say that you tried. Best of luck to you!"
scuba,37c543,he_shoots_he_scores9,2,Tue May 26 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"You would be amazed at what a diver can find - especially at that depth and with a metal detector. 80' is actually better than 20'. The odds of something kicking up the sediment at the bottom are a lot smaller at 80'. Just in case, I'd try to get a diver in the water sooner rather than later."
scuba,37c543,buckerupbuttercup,2,Tue May 26 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"I feel for you mate - sorry.  My two-penneth worth is :-  Make sure you know what you are getting from your dive shop.  Is seventy five bucks an hour for one diver, two divers or a team?  Is the time actual 'bottom time' (searching time) or wet time?  (or worse - prep and breakdown too)? This hugely affects what you get for your dollar.  You need to know that objects have a tendency to randomly 'glide' and change directions as they sink (less so with a ring - but slightly favoring the heavier side still).  Which means that even if you identify the exact surface point it will certainly be many metres away - increasing the search area.  Don't underestimate the area the needs to be searched.  Lets say something drops in 100' and the deviation is around 30deg - thats 100' dia circle on the bottom (before anyone picks me up on this, I can do the math - I haven't - I'm estimating).  The 100' circle is 7500+ square feet to be searched.   Sandy bottoms might be the worst for dense objects - they will sink under the sand quickly - and even if you think there is no current or disturbance on the lake bottom the bed is full of animals continually ploughing it over.   A fingertip search at 100' I can do about 10sqft in about 15 seconds - it will take more if there are weeds/debris.  So maybe a bit over 3 man hours to cover the area.   I don't have my dive tables, DC or planner with me - but from memory 100' no decompression limit on air is about 20mins.  This means that your dive-shop divers are using specialist gasses and deco (which is not a service I would offer at seventy five bucks an hour) or doing nine divers over a period of days.  All in all - what I guess I am saying is don't get your hopes up.  This is the proverbial needle in a haystack.  However, I am keeping my fingers crossed for you and wish you all the luck in the world - if she is the right one stick a coke can ring on her finger, if she loves you she wont care."
scuba,37c543,tlarcombe,1 point,Wed May 27 10:22:35 2015 UTC,"Good writeup of what's involved here.  If I were doing to do this, I'd dive EANx34, which gives you about 30 minutes before you hit deco.  That said, if you pump a pair of LP125s (not that I would ever advocate overfilling LP tanks) and dive thirds, you can get 45 minutes of bottom time with a 17 minute deco stop on back gas at 6m. Carry a stage of 50% and you can get nearly an hour. (VPM-B, 10% safety factor, 10 ft/min ascent rate).  (This is assuming conditions are fairly bright and clear - if so 100' END is fine. If it's really crappy down there, 34/20 would be the safest option, and available to anyone who's done TDI's AN/DP with the ""baby trimix"" add-on).  That's not to say that decompression diving is something to be taken lightly, but this isn't a horribly complicated dive or anything. If there's a tech oriented shop nearby, finding divers probably isn't an issue. If they've already got a fixed price they quote for this, it sounds like people drop stuff in this lake fairly often :)  (If you prefer a working ppO2 of 1.2, use 30% O2 and recalculate, but this isn't a particularly long or strenuous dive, and you aren't racking up the OTUs)."

That's a lot of training and gear to plan for, plus they have to use search patterns. However, it is pretty clear, so it has a good chance (I feel like I could find it in something as swanky as 100' vis, since I'm used to 1'!) of finding it.

I don't have a lot of experience diving, except for a few introductory dives as a kid - but it's as clear as anything I've been in.  The lake was formed by damming up a river and filling the area between the mountains in upstate SC.  It has a very rocky/sandy bottom, the entire lake has a sea wall and it's very clear.  It's ~20' depth at the end of my in-laws dock and we can see the bottom there from the dock.. Fwiw, the dive master I spoke with said that at 100', visibility would be better than I was thinking, so I think that part is okay..  It's just a question of the exact spot she lost it and how far it drifted from there I guess."

In the ocean I've been to 80' with decent visibility. But I did do a dive of a shipwreck in Lake Superior where the front of the boat was at 30' and the back was at 120', and I know I couldn't see the back, so I assumed 100' was around the limit. Still, if you have a decent light, you should be ok."

He said he thinks that area is closer to 60' of water.  I've had a couple fishing boats in that area and seem to think it's more in the 80-100' range, he thinks 60'-80'...  So, we'll just call it 80' of water.    It's a sandy bottom (I think.  Most of the lake is sand, I can't see that area being any different).

You wouldn't necessarily have to buy the Dive Computer initially also - you can rent them from Dive shops around here for about £15/day.   Where abouts are you diving?

scuba,37bcvt,-hh,2,Tue May 26 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'll date myself by saying that the old rule of thumb used to be that mask/fins/snorkel would run around $100 and to add a BCD, Regulator, SPG (instruments) and weightbelt would be another $1000.  Today, I'd probably budget around $200 for the M/F/S.   I think that $1K is still probably a decent number for getting a basic BCD & Regulator, although one would want to add instruments, a dive computer to this, plus some sort of thermal protection...figure $1500 or so.      A full 3mm wetsuit (for warmwater) is around $200 and very basic instrumentation (SPG, depth gage, compass) is around the same (~$150 for SPG+depth, plus ~$50 for a wrist compass).  For dive computers, a basic one starts at around $250, even those which include Nitrox.  Do resist the temptation to spend significantly more, because as a Novice, you'll not get to any appreciable cost:benefit versus anything more expensive for the forseeable future.   Physiologically, how our bodies respond to Nitrogen & Oxygen doesn't change with experience, so spending more for a ""better"" dive computer won't give you a longer dive - - what does give you a longer dive (other than a bigger tank) is to gain experience in getting your air consumption rate lower.    Note that these are all ""Brick and Mortar"" dive shop prices in the USA's Northeast ... you can save by buying mail-order, but the catch is that you pretty much always need a local shop if for no other reason than to have your regulators get serviced without having to ship them someplace."
scuba,37bcvt,cheluhu,2,Tue May 26 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"I think you need to decide on what you want you want to do.  Obviously you need a mask/snorkel/fins - ~$200.  You state you are in CA now but moving to HI. How long will you be diving in CA? You'll need a wetsuit there, but not as thick as one in HI. Figure $150-$250  For equipment, I'd want to know how often you will be diving. It's cheaper to rent unless you will be diving a lot.  A BCD and Reg (including computer) are the two things I would suggest you pick up. You don't need a tank or weights. BCD ~$500. Reg+Octo+Computer - $700.  The reason I ask how often you will be diving, is you can get a good set of nearly new gear on Craigslist for around $1k. The reason? They all went out and bought new gear and then gave it up - do NOT be one of them.  If you are new, I'd suggest you rent for a bit - find out what you like. Backplate BCD? Vest BCD? adjustable regulator? air integrated computer or wireless?  If you want new, when you take your lessons (if you haven't already) the shop may offer you a discount if you buy a package from them.  Also keep in mind that your gear needs to be serviced yearly adding to the expense besides the initial investment.  welcome!"
scuba,37bcvt,buckerupbuttercup,2,Tue May 26 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Honest question: doesn't anyone use tables anymore?   Initially to buy: Wetsuit (7mm) and hood (for CA) ($200-400). Mask/snorkel/fins ($100-200). Dive knife ($50-$100). Gloves and booties ($75-$100).  Rent: BCD, Tank, Reg, Weights/Belt   I dive regularly in Southern CA. The water is chilly year round. I would invest in a good (new) wetsuit, hood, gloves and booties. It doesn't matter how good the rest of your gear is - if you're thinking about how cold you are the entire time, the dive is going to suck. A good set of mask and fins also helps. Get what makes you most comfortable. If you're uncomfortable/fiddling with the basics of your gear the entire time, it's not going to be fun and you aren't going to want to keep diving.   I also like carrying a dive knife with me on every dive - some place that's easy to reach. It's come in useful on a number of occasions, and it also gives me peace of mind knowing if I get tangled in something, I can easily get my way out.   I don't mention a computer because I've never used one, I've always ran tables. I've heard a computer makes diving a lot simpler, and it sounds like a good idea. Learning your tables is also a good idea. Knowing your tables and having a dive computer would probably be a great combo."
scuba,37bcvt,cheluhu,1 point,Tue May 26 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"I have both tables and a computer. The big difference between the two is that the computer will adjust for you naturally going up and down during the dive.  For example: if you are using a table, you go by deepest depth. So even if you are only at 100' for 1 minute, you need to plan your dive like it's 100' deep.   The computer otoh, will realize that you were only at 100' for 1 minute and adjust your time accordingly."

For bigger subjects like turtles you definitely need two strobes to uniformly light the subject.

With two strobes you can effectively light the entire subject with the edge of your strobe cones and get way better black backgrounds."

However, if they are real pros and not just pretend ones, they will often not actually be using the second strobe.  Shooting efficiently with a strobe underwater is no mean feat, it can get very complicated especially if your strobe isn't connected to the  camera through a hot shoe. You will usually end up setting everything manually, and that's hard enough with just a single strobe.  My advice is therefore to get one really good strobe, get comfortable with it, and if after a hundred dives and a thousand shots you really feel that you're limited in your creativity, then get a second one to math the first. You will then also have a much better idea of the specs you want for your second strobe."

scuba,3788ix,dearmapmaker,25,Mon May 25 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"if you're talking about being crushed, the human body is mostly composed of water and is thus remarkably resistant to crushing.   The problem encountered much sooner is toxicity of breathing gas.  Oxygen becomes toxic to humans at 1.4 to 1.8 partial pressure depending on who you ask and bottom time. This means air (21% o2) can only take you safely to about 70 meters before risking seizures.  To mitigate this divers start replacing oxygen an nitrogen in breathing gas with helium and sometimes hydrogen or neon.  These gases also have limits. Helium, for example,  starts to give divers violent tremors at depths greater than 300m. When I say violent I mean enough to prevent further descent and make it difficult for divers to keep regulators in their mouths."
scuba,3788ix,tepkel,5,Mon May 25 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's for a story. It's one of those Stephen King style stories where somebody is getting revenge.

scuba,3788ix,tepkel,22,Mon May 25 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"Your best bet for realism is probably to put them on just air and take them to 120-150m very quickly. Going much deeper than that on different mixes requires switching between mixes on the descent. Not sure you could get an unwilling participant to do that. At that depth on air a diver would seize pretty quickly.  There are a number of videos out there of divers last moments. The most famous are probably Dave Shaw or Yuri Lipski. The second of which was at about 100m on air. There is a strong feeling in the diving community that these should be shared and watched to learn from the mistakes of those who have gone before us, so they are on Youtube. I guess use your best judgment as to whether they are appropriate to use as research material for a story. These were real people who left loved ones when they died.  This is weirding me out a little bit. I don't mind talking about this stuff with other divers for the betterment of the sport, but it's a little different talking about it for research for a fictional story.. It's a pretty touchy subject for a lot of divers. Myself included."

The mixing in the tank probably wouldn't be a problem since there would be nothing to ignite the mixture (sparks etc...).

scuba,3788ix,jonny_boy27,8,Mon May 25 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"If I take your question as a tank, i.e. a single cylinder...  We're looking at a single mix bounce dive here so let's try with a single normoxic mix (as we're not allowing ourselves any travel or deco gas). Using ZHLC with 30/85 gradient factors in multideco and 18/35 and pushing the max PPO2 to 1.6 (which is a bit sketchy) then I get an MOD of about 80m with an END of 48m which is also pushing a bit for my tastes. Let's see what size tank we need:    Depth Arive Leave Time On    80m 6min 6:20 20s 18/35   24m 18min 19min 1min 18/35   18m 20min 23min 3min 18/35   12m 23min 32min 9min 18/35   6m 33min 80min 47min 18/35    Which means (9bar x 25l/minx18min)+(3.4barx25l/minx2min)+(2.8barx25l/minx3min)+(2.2barx25l/minx9min)+(1.6barx25l/minx27min) = 6007 surface litres of gas, applying rule of thirds gives us over 9000 surface litres of gas required.  @232 bar that'd be a 40l; or 30l at 300 bar and I've not seen either of those in the wild!  Biggest I've seen is a 232 bar 20l which is 4640l total gas  or 3090l usable with rule-of thirds. Assuming that's 18/35, let's see how deep we can get: 60m for zero bottom time? Nope, needs 3800l. We can turn down the helium a bit, but still keeping the END under 50m with some 23/13 results in a plan needing 2220l which means either a 232 bar 15 or a 300 bar 12!  I'm sure you could tweak the numbers a bit more and eke out a couple more metres but trying to keep your END and MOD relatively sensible with some degree of safety margin (aside from the lack of a redundant gas supply - ha!) mean you're not going to get much further.

scuba,3788ix,Srekcalp,3,Tue May 26 08:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hi,   multiple high-pressure tanks   A regular tank would be enough sufficient. They could go four times deeper than any diver has gone before they equalised. I'm sure they're strong enough to resist some crushing after that.   supply a lot of oxygen   oxygen wouldn't be your biggest problem. You would 'sort-of' want less of it, as the deeper you are the denser the gases you breathe get. If you have too much Oxygen you will fit and die.   how deep could they go before the pressure would kill them   Pressure doesn't kill you directly. For example I could take an inflated balloon to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and as long as I gradually added air to it as it descended it would would appear just the same as it would just a few centimetres. Pressure does kill you by compressing your breathing gases, making them denser, 'sort of' overdosing you.  The deepest Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) dive is 332 metres.   Would it be impossible to carry enough oxygen to get there?   We'll just ignore the oxygen bit there, as we've already covered that. You could go deeper than that 332 metres, if you breathed hydrogen alongside oxygen. However you'd have to be fucking crazy to put hydrogen in a cylinder, as it's highly highly reactive/volatile. The amazing Comex dived to 534 metres (and 701 metres, chamber simulated) using hydrogen through an umbilical, which is safer.  Once you understand these principles, it will all make sense. You remind me of how I used to think about diving. Here are some question threads I posted that maybe able to help you: 1, 2, 3, 4  Feel free to ask me any questions  edit: lol, should've checked comments first, I can see my right honourable fellow divers have already explained the above, and better than I did."
scuba,3788ix,uclatommy,3,Mon May 25 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"If I understand the spirit of your question correctly, you are asking about how much pressure our body can withstand?  If so, the answer is that we can go as deep as we want in the ocean. Our bodies are incompressible so water pressure will not damage us. What kills you is the density of breathing gases at pressure. Breathing high density air is toxic. An additional hazard is what happens to the gases as you surface and pressure decreases. The gases dissolved in your tissues expand and can cause problems.  So in summary, you can go down as deep as you want, as long as you are not breathing pressurized gas. This is why professional free divers can go much deeper than scuba divers. They do it all in one breath."

It should be noted 2 other people died on that dive at about 485 ft so don't try this at home kids.  You shouldn't dive on pure oxygen below 20 ft or you'll likely have seizures from CNS toxicity.   And then you drown.  Previously it was theorized (up until the 1960s) that diving below 50 msw/6ata would crush the thorasic cavity (chest) but that has been shown to be an invalid theory
scuba,3788ix,nigelh,2,Tue May 26 00:02:53 2015 UTC,We can dive until the viscosity of the gas in our tanks stopped us clearing carbon dioxide from our lungs. I believe Comex achieved  a 700 meter wet chamber test in about 1992 so it's deeper than that but that was with huge amounts of hydrogen in the mix and less than 1% oxygen so you can't go much further.
scuba,3788ix,hargikas,1 point,Mon May 25 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"First of all, are you sure you want the tanks to have oxygen? In Scuba Diving 100% Oxygen is used only in some deco stops. Most of the divers are using Air to breath.  The mixture of what the diver is breathing is essential to know what are his depth limits. See this article for that.  So tell us what depth want your story to reach and reddit can easily find the mixture the diver has to breath.  There are many reasons why a diver can die underwater:   Oxygen Toxicity: Breathing an unsuitable gas mixture at a certain depth (the one that most people in this thread are talking about) Out of Gas (Air): The diver has depleted all the gas without ascending to the surface.  (Murder: faulty SPG with an half full tank) Decompression Sickness: Ascending to the surface without following any mandated decompression stops (Murder: The diver is occupied or tangled underwater for a long time so he has to make decompressions stops but he hasn't got the gas to do them.) Arterial Gas Embolism: Fast Ascend while breath holding (usually due to a panic attack or similar. Murder: The victim is an untrained diver and getting him out of his comfort zone) Hypercapnia: The diver is under a workload and he is not breathing normally.  Hypocapnia: The diver is breathing too much Equipment failure: The diver is not trained or haven't took the appropriate planning to handle that failure (this goes well with the murder and revenge) Lost: Especially in cave diving. (A good murder story could be about a cave diver who on his way out, changed the diving lines to lead the diver victim deeper into the cave.) CO Poisoning: The diver breaths unsuitable gas. (Carbon Monoxide is a clear, odourless gas that can easily (fast) can make a diver unconscious underwater. Murder: The killer is scuba diving blender) Fighting: And eventually drowing (Murder Like a Real Story)   A good read is this one. If you want your character to become the deepest person while dying here is the list deepending on what equipment he was using.  Of course the diver could be a free diver so just time is main parameter to have the victim die. A nice idea for the murder can come from real life incidents."

You get a lot of old anesthesiology textbooks and papers. I'm sure that there's a conclusive, recent study showing how fast anesthetic gasses cross the blood brain barrier after inspiration, and you can probably extrapolate (from the hydrophobic ones at least) by using the rough approximation that diffusion times go as the square root of mass (i.e. something 4 times as massive diffuses twice as fast)"

scuba,378n04,nigelh,3,Mon May 25 23:39:51 2015 UTC,"A ppO2 of 2 is about where the limit used to be for navy divers and so early civvy diving. It's been found that some people have lower tolerances (than hyper fit people in their 20s), and so the limits were reduced to 1.6. 1.4 is a safety margin on that.   I've spiked ppO2 to 1.7-1.8 myself, with no ill effects, but only for very short periods.   Edit: forgot to mention. O2 treatments in a chamber will take people up to about 3.0 I think (20m on pure O2), but...   the patient is monitored at all times the patient is idle it's expected that convolutions may happen, and the nurse is there to deal with them."
scuba,378n04,scubahana,2,Tue May 26 07:54:10 2015 UTC,"Table 6 has you at a ppO2 of 2.8 for 20-30 minutes at a time.  I have a friend who was doing blue-water drift deco, got task-loaded at one of his deeper stops clipping off a bottle or helping a teammate or fiddling with some other thing and exposed himself to a ppO2 of 2.2 or 2.4, I don't recall. He got lucky.  /u/olenruotsalainen - It's entirely about risk assessment. If a minute at 1.7 yields an oxtox rate of 0.1% (completely made up numbers), that's totally acceptable in a nice dry chamber with a nurse on hand, because they just turn down the O2 and maybe you bump your head or bite your tongue. That's totally unacceptable on SCUBA because that guarantees one fatality per thousand dives conducted at that max ppO2.   Acute oxtox also seems to be sensitive to how much you're moving around, and how much oxygen exposure you've already had. A lot of CCR divers are using ppO2 setpoints of 1.2-1.3 and only moving to 1.6 when they start deco. I don't know what the preferred working set-point is for OC deco diving, but I suspect it shifts further from 1.4 towards 1.2 as you add more deco obligation."

scuba,37b4lw,July_One,5,Tue May 26 09:23:56 2015 UTC,"I love liveaboards. If you want to go to a dive-only holiday, they are (in my opinion) the best thing you can do. For me, there are several advantages over diving from shore, although there are plenty of places where diving from shore is just as good.   You can get to places which are not reachable by daily boats. For example, Cocos islands, Papua New Guinea or the more southern parts of Egypt are too remote to be reached without daily boats. Because of the first point the reefs are normally in a better state, as not that many divers have dived there. The people on liveaboards are really into diving and normally know what they do underwater and dive responsibly. Diving from shore and daily boats you experience a fair share of divers who you wonder if they'll kill themselves as soon as they are in the water. I've yet to experience that on a liveaboard.  As it is all-inclusive you don't have to do anything. It's really an eat-dive-sleep circle, which I enjoy. It's not more expensive than diving from land if you include accomodation and food.   That being said, if you travel with somebody who is not into diving a liveaboard is probably not the right choice, as on most boats there is not much to do besides diving."

scuba,37b4lw,kdog92,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:46:21 2015 UTC,"If you want to have warm water and not too far away, Egypt is your best bet. Take a liveaboard there and do a deep south tour, as those places cannot be reached by daily boats, which results in way less divers. If you like wrecks you can also take one of the north tours.  In Europe Portofino in Italy is a great spot in the mediterranean. It's, as far as I know, the oldest aquatic national park in Europe and is really colorful, given that you dive in Europe. The only drawback is the water temperature, as it is only about 17-20 degrees and gets cooler when you go further down. Other than that, Malta is also recommendable.  Apart from that, I've been to the Maldives last August and it was great. If you want a liveaboard recommendation, the Carpe Vita is a marvelous boat. It's run by a Agnes, a dutch woman who has lived in the region for years.  Then, two years ago I went to Turks & Caicos, which is near the Bahamas. As with other places it's recommendable to take a liveaboard. West Caicos and French Cay are wonderful dive spots. On top of that, it is really easy diving. No currents and great visibility.  I also heard great things about Papua New Guinea, although it's quite hard to get there. It is also quite expensive and can have ripping currents, but the wild life has to be extraordinary. The same can be said for Raja Ampat, hard to get there but one of the best ecosystems there is, especially if you like macro stuff.  In July I could tell you more about Cocos Islands, but up to now I can only say that it should be great if you want to see the big stuff (whale sharks, hammerheads, dolphins and so on)"

More often that not it was some old 80s BC they had from a garage sale or the rubber components, mouthpieces, or hoses had dry rotted.   See if your school has certification classes, but best bet is just to call dive shops and find the price, including the cost for the dives."

Most of my gear I got from family friends who dived before my time, people would give them new gear, they'd try it once and hate it so I got it. I will admit the BC Vest I use has seen better days"
scuba,379hn5,scubamarketing,1 point,Tue May 26 01:31:42 2015 UTC,"$200 is on the pretty low end already. Anyone else advertising less will likely then ask for book fees, certification fees, etc. a good course is 30+ hours with an instructor, so $200 is less than $10/hour for someone teaching you to breathe underwater. Personally, I'd save up until I could buy a good course, not the cheapest one."
scuba,376j6g,wolfgangmob,2,Mon May 25 07:55:48 2015 UTC,"Usually a weight belt will do just fine.   There are solutions like weight pockets or this one but you sacrifice your strimlining an you can become a little bit more bulky. Also solutions like bolt on weights but there are mounted so they can't be quick released in an emergency.  Recommend you dive a steel cylinder. That will take off 6-8 pounds of lead.   Some small recommendations:   Regardless if you are using a BCD or BP&W it is not advisable to have all your weights in your BCD or BP&W. If for any reason you want to remove your equipment whilst underwater (for example untangling yourself for a Kelp or other) you will be extremely buoyant and that will make the effort trickier. If you carry too much weight (dry suit, high salinity levels) start thinking of trimming some of the weights to a better position.   More info"

I used some 1"" nylon webbing and SS triglides to make the belt into a weight harness, grand total was around $35 for the belt, webbing and triglides. If I need to ditch I can open the weight pockets and drop a couple of weights rather than bulk drop. The pockets can easily hold my 3lb soft weights but 4lb might be the most for soft weights. I did buy a couple trim pockets for my top cam band  which should give me enough options and should be more than enough weight for my current suit. Now to just go diving wit the set up."

scuba,376j6g,nigelh,0,Mon May 25 12:23:02 2015 UTC,I like the pocketed weight belts. They are more comfortable than lumps on a strap and they work just the same on holiday loaded with whatever your dive boat provides. The day when some hired reg decided you want to breathe seawater a familiar clip at your waist makes getting back to the boat to complain much more likely.  I don't like the 'cut it' plan. If you just inhaled seawater you really do not want complications in your life.
scuba,376j6g,nigelh,2,Tue May 26 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"I hate the idea of weight drops at depth, you run the risk of uncontrolled ascent that will only get worse a you go up since wetsuits only gain buoyancy as you ascend. If something goes wrong and it is an emergency you should CESA, not weight drop, once you surface you can weight drop to make yourself positive."

scuba,370sp5,murkleton,4,Sun May 24 05:11:29 2015 UTC,We're not doctors. Get a second opinion from a different doctor. Perhaps an aquatically trained doctor maybe more suited to fill out your medical and more willing to answer and educate you on the risks involved by diving with type 1 diabetes. The chances are your doctor doesn't know what effects pressure might have on your condition. If it's a no then I'm afraid it's a no. Sometimes we have to make tough decisions based on our own safety.  I had problems getting a HSE medical in the UK to be a divemaster. The issues I was having meant that I couldn't dive for 12 months until I had put in work to get them sorted. I understand how frustrating this is but I knew the decisions both the doctors and myself had made were the right ones.

Think about how you would get sugar underwater.  I discussed this with my doc and his advice was to always make sure I ate before I got in the water.    My dive instructor had some more severe diabetics and said some of my them had mastered the ability to open honey packs underwater, squeeze it in their mouth, and get the reg back in.  I carry glucose emergency packs found in camping stores.  Have not had to do use one yet.  But I am type 2 and very stable.  Remember that if you get sick at depth, you still have to allow for safety stops and decompression stops.   You could be many minutes away from the help you need even if you are right under the dive boat.  Remember that if your sugar levels go too low, you could have a seizure or lose consciousness.  This is a BIG RISK because you are LIKELY TO DROWN because you will likely  LOSE your regulator.  Dive trips are often a long way from medical care!  You could be dead before you get to help if you have an emergency, especially if no one knows you are diabetic.  It is hard, at least to me, to stay well hydrated in a wet suit, etc.  Dehydration increases risk for the bends , etc.    One way to decrease the financial risk of a medical emergency and needing medical evac is to join DAN.  But I would wonder if DAN would pay if they found you had lied on the physical.  Given all that, you may want to think hard before you lie to the instructors.  But I can tell you, I love every minute of it and I am fat, female, diabetic and hypertensive.  I cope by always diving with dive schools and making sure they know I am bringing a bit more risk to the trip.  I offer to pay more if they feel the need to bring along extra supervision.    That strategy has largely worked.  But I did have a near emergency, in a pool, in the desert, in a heavy wetsuit, in the dark, with a dive school, and it was very, very, scary.  I was very near heat stroke, very, very dehydrated,  and I got sick in the blink of an eye.  No one noticed until they started yelling at me for hanging on the pool ropes because I was suddenly too weak and to sick to cope.   I would have been an emergency in just a couple more minutes.  It would have been a disaster in open water.  I was too weak to think.  The male safety swimmer left me at a dressing room because I said I would be ok.  I had to rest and hydrate before I could remove the wet suit.  Then I made many more stupid decisions.  I finally made a smart one and cancelled my trip, even though I lost the money.  I just did not trust that particular setup.  If you decide to go ahead with the plan to not disclose, at least consider a full face mask.  This will at least reduce the risk of drowning if you black out.  In short, I know instructors that dive with / train type 1 diabetics but that is with divers who disclose their condition, work with a dive doc to mitigate the risk, and enable the dive master to be prepared for the risk.  Think twice about your plan.  It could be FATAL."

Especially since you have to submit a doctor's note saying you are medically cleared. If your doctor doesn't think it's a good idea, are you going to doctor shop and just conveniently leave information out?"
scuba,370sp5,eanx100,1 point,Sun May 24 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew the implications of diving as a diabetic, but I don't, so I'll try to be as helpful as I can.    The PADI questionnaire is a matter of liability and making sure that the dive master is not making medical calls for you, you and/ or your doctor are.  Padi doesn't want their instructors telling students they can dive with medical problems that they are not personally experts on.  Now I do know that there are a multitude of questions on there that represent minor issues which shouldn't affect you and I've even had an instructor tell me (off the record) that I should just check no next to seasonal allergies because that would have meant I had to go get a written note and I wouldn't be able to get in the water that day.    The PADI rules are written by lawyers and will only affect you in class, however, so the real question you need to ask is how much risk there is to you and those around you.  You have to remember that your medical conditions don't just affect you, they affect everyone in the water with you and potentially the safety of rescue responders as well.  Ask your doctor why you shouldn't dive, research the odds that a problem will occur.  Get a second opinion if you need.  If it's a real problem you are going to need to disclose that to all future dive buddies and dive masters/ guides on future excursions.  Just please don't assume that because you are willing to take a risk that everyone else is in the water is okay with the complications and danger of an emergency situation."
scuba,370sp5,kawasutra,1 point,Sat May 23 20:47:06 2015 UTC,Most docs don't know anything about diving.

As far as hard weights it depends, I can find scrap lead cheap but you do need a mold for each size and melting equipment. Also, depending on your gear 10-12kg is not the max, drysuit or two piece wetsuit in cold salt water with a BCD and an AL80 and now you are using 15+ kg."

The best sub dive that I've read about is probably the DeepSee submersible on the Argo from the Undersea Hunter group. It reaches about 1000 feet when diving around Cocos Island, Costa Rica. That requires you to take the liveaboard to Cocos Island, which isn't cheap, but the dive experience, as chronicled by Jonathan Bird, seems incredible."

Make sure you take charge and assign people to point pronto so you have a reasonable chance of finding them!   Lots of instructors like to put extra weight in their BCDs/belts so that they are more difficult to subdue/rescue.

scuba,36r6sf,sirbikesalot,9,Thu May 21 13:56:15 2015 UTC,Come on. On an 80 meter OC dive I'd have big back mounted twins and big side mounted stages. It's not 'which' but 'where do I put all this darn gas that I need?'  And people wonder why I dive a rebreather?
scuba,36r6sf,nigelh,3,Thu May 21 18:41:07 2015 UTC,The folks I know doing those types of dives all use big backmounted twins and sidemounted/slung bottles when using OC.  However most of the folks I know doing those dive are on CC.
scuba,36r6sf,DoctorHandwaver,2,Thu May 21 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"What I find interesting about side mount is that it hasn't gotten the same ""Evil!!!"" rhetoric that independent twins used to get by the advocates of manifolds.  My general thoughts are that once again, there's trade-offs and part of what's involved here include gas management planning vs fixed/floppy vs dive plan constrained overheads (cross-section) vs ability to drop, ability to modularize (weight on/off boats, etc), etc..."

scuba,36r6sf,jonny_boy27,2,Thu May 21 20:21:03 2015 UTC,There is no perfect gear that is best for all scenarios.   One area where SM does shine is if you have a bad back or bad knees or just have a hard time humping around backmounted twins.   SM and gear up in the water.

They're also all currently selling their neoprene drysuits for trilam ones again. It's nice to have nice things, especially when all the cool kids are wearing it.  Different setups have different uses and it really depends on the dive and also what is available if you're not diving at home.  Throw me in an overhead environment and I'll take sidemount any day but it's a pain in the arse to setup and put on in the water, especially with all the tackle you need for 80m+"
scuba,36r6sf,murkleton,1 point,Thu May 21 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"I'm taking my big deco courses now, focused towards sidemount, so expect that bias.   I would prefer sidemount. I could spew all the statistics about how it's 50% safer than BM doubles, dispell the rumors of it being JUST SO MUCH STUFF (it's not that bad, really)... But the ultimate answer? What're you comfortable with. I, personally, love sidemount. I've got a bad back and being able to slap one tank on and jump in the water on a boat or wade in on shore and clip off the rest of my bottles is amazing. I love that I have one less failure point with independent doubles. I don't love that they do kinda flop around if I have to load myself up on a rocky boat. SM takes a little getting used to, but if you have experience and training in it, you'll be okay. Personally, I choose SM because I find that having all of my stages on my sides instead of having two on one side and BM doubles on my back and all that is nicer.   Personal opinion. I know this gets to be a heated debate, and I never like that. Don't crap all over one person's favor of diving because you like the other."
scuba,36r6sf,doombuggy110,1 point,Fri May 22 03:40:35 2015 UTC,There are divers all over the world doing deep dives to 100m+ in sidemount. The benefit is that in the event of a potential gas loss situation is that you can 'feather' any one of your valves and keep and use most of your availed gas. One of your first stages blows on a primary bottle? Replace it with one of the rigs one your other bottles. Have extended deco and want to swap out all your empty bottles /equipment? Trade any one or all of your bottles with a support diver!   6 bottles - http://youtu.be/F0vsilwlxJE  Deep Trimix - http://youtu.be/MeI8vuTigjE
scuba,36r6sf,unclesandwicho,2,Thu May 21 14:45:54 2015 UTC,The first guy is in a quarry and the second video is dead calm water. You try that in the North Atlantic and tell me sidemount is just as good as backmount all the time.  I love sidemount and dive it all the time- but I'm not stupid enough to try it in 6+ foot seas. 4 bottles under my arms is my limit. I need more- the rest are going on my back.  If I'm doing a serious penetration of a wreck- I'm using backmount (assuming she's upright). I don't mind swinging my bottles to get through an opening- but I'm not doing an entire dive like that. If the wreck is on her side- then sidemount would win out.  Each has their pros and cons- you dive whatever is appropriate for the dive you're doing.
scuba,36r6sf,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 21 15:55:34 2015 UTC,Also shutdown drills are easier with SM because you can see.   I had a 1st stage blow on me in an overhead environment.  Shutdown was about 3 sec vs 20-30sec of going through a drill with backmount doubles to find and isolate the issue.

Communication isn't just about hand signals, we're social creatures and you'll start to be able to read people much better underwater. Their eyes tell you a lot.   Learn to count like this. If you want a challenge buy some lobster mitts and learn to count in those too. One is your index, two is index and thumb, three is middle, ring and pinky fingers, four is all four fingers.

I know cold diving pretty well.   It starts the day before. No matter how fit or unfit you are, or what your current fitness goals are, you over eat like mad the day before a dive, particularly at dinner. You must be running on an over-full tank. If you're trying to lose weight, great, fine, cut cals the rest of the time. Not the day before a dive.   Sleep well. No or little alcohol is ideal but negotiable.   When you wake up, over-dress. Wear layers, and enough that you are slightly uncomfortably warm. The target is to get as close to sweating as possible, without sweating. You should be thinking ""Jeez, I can't wait to get these clothes off and change into my suit."" If you're dreading getting a chill while you change, you've already lost, it's going to be a cold dive.   I don't dive dry, so I can't suggest particulars, but get some fantastic undergarments. Keep your core warm. Some people I know dive electric heated vests and love them. You can also get reusable heat packs. Don't use the disposables, I've heard they get too hot when pressurised (it's a reaction w oxygen that fuels them).   Warm hands come from a warm core, period. No glove in the world is relevant if your core is cold. Your body will shut down circulation to your hands to keep you warm, and your hands will freeze. Get a decent under glove and a rubber dry glove and if your hands are cold, make your core warmer. The hunt for the ""perfect glove"" is a ghost hunt. The guy who says his hands ""never get cold"" in his setup just has a warmer core than you do, not better gloves. Seriously, think about it....it's a losing equation. Heat is going to be lost, big time through your hands, no matter what glove you have. The only way to keep them warm is to keep extra heat flowing into them from your body.   I even know a couple guys who dive wet handed. I have 5 mm gloves with fully welded seams that seal to my wet suit, and they are incredible.

scuba,36kcdn,ibeckman671,37,Wed May 20 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"A few questions for yourself:   Have you been diving recently? Have you been diving in the conditions you'll experience recently? Are you familiar and comfortable with the gear you'll be using? Will there be a dive master in the water supervising the dive? Will the group be small with experienced divers? Will the water be warm with good visibility and little to no current?   You're going to want a lot of yes answers.  What you obviously want to avoid is jumping into unfamiliar water with unfamiliar gear with strong current after not diving for 12 months.  As others have mentioned, this is a bit of a trust me dive.  And while it's good to expand your limits, you'll want to do it safely.  If you've done a handful of dives with this shop and feel comfortable with absolutely everything, I think it's okay to try something a little deeper.  But I'd definitely recommend a few dives in this location first.  I typically prefer dives in the 40-60 foot range.  There's usually a little more life and the dives last longer.  If you're not comfortable with this dive, try to go on a dive later in the day.  For most travel locations, they do their deep dives in the morning and get progressively more shallow throughout the day."
scuba,36kcdn,notajerk02,5,Wed May 20 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"Second. All of this. Solid questions and advice.  If those are all ""yes,"" then there technically isn't much of a difference between 60 and 80 feet, but it's just that much more distance between your potential issue and the safety of the surface. If something goes down, you're inherently working on a reduced timeline (gas supply, and closer to decompression obligations, etc.) - lots of stuff that's explained better in an Advanced Open Water course.  As with most new skills and environments, be aware of compounding stress factors: particularly rough conditions, health concerns, new gear, pretty much anything that makes you less than ""on your A-game"" for a new dive. I'm sure you, myself, and most other divers could rock the dive in perfect conditions, but if something goes wrong, are you confident enough in your current level of training to handle a few other things properly?  I'm rambling. Sounds like an Advanced course is due soon. Good luck!"

PADI Open Water Divers are some of the best in the industry - which is disappointing to say when some of the absolute worst AOW divers in the industry are certified by PADI.  I've never used a C card past AOW for any random budddy-pair  dive and I've honestly used my AOW only a handful of times.    If you know how to dive, divers will know.

There are certifications that function as an artificial benchmark, but ultimately you are on control of your own fate. If you do not feel comfortable diving to 80 feet, then you shouldn't. The fact that you are asking indicates you may not be ready.  Reality is that there is not much difference between 60 and 80 feet. Both depths are equally inhospitable to human life. If you feel you want more experience before heading deeper, then get some more experience.   If you know that you can be buddied with a good DM or an instructor that will keep you close and keep a close eye on you - AND you are comfortable with the idea, then dive to 80 feet. If you are unsure or nervous, that is the first indicator that you are not ready."
scuba,36kcdn,sharkiteuthis,-1,Wed May 20 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"Reality is that there is not much difference between 60 and 80 feet.   I know you know better than this. You have DI flair, you're a cold-water diver, and my RES mod has you at +7 in this sub, which means I have probably decided that you're worth listening to.  There is absolutely a difference if your buddy has a problem and has to switch to your gas. Let's assume that neither of you freaks out and start sucking air, but we'll use a slighly high warm-water RMV of 1 ft3/min as a buffer since these are new divers and are probably swimming upright.  At 80' you need 31 ft3 of gas to get you to the surface safely. At 60' you only need 19 ft3 of gas. So the rock bottom turn pressure on an AL80 rated to 3000psi is 1400psi at 80' and 900 psi at 60'.  And that's assuming nobody panics and drops deeper than the max depth, starts sucking down air at 2+ ft3/min, etc, etc, etc. A new diver who is finning to stay upright and runs out of gas could easily drop 20' before the (also potentially inexperienced) buddy gets there and fumbles the octo - and now you need 40 ft3 of gas for a safe ascent, plus you're almost certainly both narced and panicked, so you have to hope a third diver or one of the DMs notices your dive just went tits up. And I don't put a lot of faith in DMs at these foreign shops who routinely take students fresh out of OW on 100' 'trust me' dives on single AL80's.  Now, on a nice, clear, tropical dive, is 80' really substantially different from 60' in terms to risk? No. But that doesn't mean you get to skip the gas planning step."
scuba,36kcdn,CanadianDiver,3,Wed May 20 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, I am going to leave it to you to revisit your math and how to calculate your consumption based on an RMV of 1 as you suggested. Needless to say, your calculations are no where near correct.  Hint: ((Depth / 33) + 1) * (RMV) = consumption at depth per minute)   That being said, I am not advocating a 'trust me' dive ... I am speaking of a dive 'guide' that the divers trusts to keep a close eye on them. Having a dive mentor take through a new challenge is not the same as trusting someone you do not know. Mentoring is how most divers learned in the past, and it is the best way."
scuba,36kcdn,sharkiteuthis,0,Wed May 20 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"Are you factoring in the second diver on your octo? Total RMV is 2 if you have a buddy OOG. Frankly, it's probably a lot higher than that for a few minutes until both divers calm down and start the ascent.  I was lazy and googled ""rock bottom gas calculator"" to get those numbers (note that there's also a 200 psig buffer built into his calculator), but his formula checks out. If you really insist, I'll hand check it and post it to imgur..."
scuba,36kcdn,eanx100,0,Wed May 20 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"Your calculations are way off.  It takes 2 minutes to surface from 80 ft.  Yes you could do it faster with the 60 ft/min but most people can't do a controlled ascent that fast and a lot of people recommend 30 ft/min.   So 2 min.  We're doing no stop diving so a safety stop can be skipped in an emergency.  Let's go for a bad case scenario.  Let's assume your SAC is poor, 0.8 cuft/min and your buddy is the same.   But double it because if you're doing an emergency ascent you're probably not calm.   So 0.8 x 2 x 2 = 3.2 cuft/min.   But now we need to account for depth.  Average depth for the ascent is 40 ft.    3.2 cuft/min x 2 min x (40/33) + 1) = 14.14 cuft, which is less than half of what you calculated using software incorrectly.  Incidentally, this is also why spare airs are a stupid gimmick."
scuba,36kcdn,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Thu May 21 12:03:40 2015 UTC,"It's closer to 3 minutes if you actually stick to 30 ft/min, so that's a little less than 20 ft3 without a safety stop. And I didn't use the calculator incorrectly - I used a very conservative RMV of 1 ft3/min/diver because we're talking about someone with a whopping 8 dives (the calculator doesn't double the RMV, it uses what you tell it to), and the calculator assumes:   1 minute at depth to assess the problem and donate regulator to the OOA diver. Ascend at 30 ft/min to half of the max depth. Ascend at 10 ft/min for remainder of dive to surface.   Plus it factors in an extra 200psi buffer (so ~5 ft3 on a typical AL80) in the tank because SPGs can get wonky below 500psi.  I use a slightly different profile for calculating turn pressure on a single tank, but it's roughly that conservative, and I'll do it out by hand and post a picture if you really really want me to.  Yes, you can skip the safety stops, and if you want to plan your gas that way, fine. I don't. I mean, in theory, a 60' CESA ought to be fine - I think it used to be part of the OW training standards, in fact.   Incidentally, this is also why spare airs are a stupid gimmick.   Yeah, anything smaller than a 20 is pretty useless as a pony, especially if you have to shoot a bag to ascend on. Then you really need a 30 at minimum, ideally a 40. I think we've had this exact exchange on here before."
scuba,36kcdn,c0r3yz,7,Thu May 21 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"The best advice I was given was to never go on a dive you're not comfortable with. If the extra depth has you worried, pass on the dive. Worry can lead to panic, which can lead to burning your gas faster or making mistakes.   That said, the 20ft difference is still within recreational limits. Plan a safe dive and stick to you plan and it will be a successful dive."
scuba,36kcdn,sunfrost,9,Wed May 20 03:03:33 2015 UTC,If you're comfortable with your skill level then I wouldn't be to worried but I always remember that most of the best dives are shallower and longer in duration. That's my 2 cents at least.
scuba,36kcdn,awesterdam,6,Wed May 20 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is merely a suggestion (or more correctly, recommendation). 130ft is the recreational limit. I'm sure it's in your textbook.  I have had severe narcosis at 80ft before, think really high on weed, so certainly you may experience things you are not prepared for. A deep diving specialty will cover the things you need to know (recommended, but is not a necessity). Frankly, you'll probably not even notice you went down to 80ft, aside from having a shorter dive, and everything looking darker."
scuba,36kcdn,-hh,7,Wed May 20 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"For a warmwater tropical dive, there's not really all that much of a difference between 40, 60 or 80, other than how long the dive is going to last.   Personally, when I get buddied up with a random novice, I generally don't like to plan a warmwater tropical dive deeper than around 80fsw, and I'll keep a close eye on how they're doing, air consumption, etc.  As was mentioned, there are some artificial constraints in moden certifications which merely take gaining some personal experience to gain perspective.    Back in the day, a dive to 60fsw used to be considered a certification requirement for one's 4th check-out dive...and 60, 61, 65...didn't matter, as the requirement was to crack 60....yet today,  the Agency  QA Dept will throw a hissy fit if a student survey reports that they went an inch deeper than 59.9ft.  Go figure."

As you get more experience, you will be happy to go on deeper dives.  If you let them know that you'd rather keep it shallow until you get more experience, they should respect that. If they don't, then they probably aren't who you want to be dealing with. I know it's not always easy to assert something like that.   But, if YOU are comfortable with the idea, then I think you should have no problem going to 80 ft. 8 dives isn't ""relatively new."" 8 dives is ""wobbly newborn calf new."" Staying shallow is the best way to improve your core skills and have fun!  All my opinion of course. Safe diving!"
scuba,36kcdn,xdjio,8,Wed May 20 04:02:14 2015 UTC,"The general rule - don't go on ""trust me"" dives ever. Diving isn't a race, the best computer is your own brain, and let your own skills and ability be your guide. At 8 dives, the volume of experiences you haven't had to draw on is huge - it's the things you don't know (and that you don't know you don't know) that are lurking out there.   What kind of a dive shop is this that will play fast and loose with the standards? What else are they playing fast and loose with?"
scuba,36kcdn,scubahana,2,Wed May 20 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it does have an impact. The partial pressure of nitrogen crosses over into the narcotic threshold between 18-24m which is why 18m was made the OW depth limit. Most divers will not experience noticeable effect, however some do and for a diver with eight dives that potential factor can make a difference."
scuba,36kcdn,CaribbeanCaptain,5,Wed May 20 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"It's not a limit though, it's a recommendation."

EDIT: I was on mobile when I originally posted this; additionally should an incident occur that bears relation to the dive where recommended depth limits are exceeded then this will be scrutinised by all sides of the incident. Things like that are generally taken as a strike against all parties as non-practise of prudent diver behaviour."

I've been absolutely fine (self-assessment by tying knots and doing integrals on my dive slate) at 117' when it was 77F and top-to-bottom viz breathing EANx30 (not that it matters since NOAA recommends counting O2 for END). I was almost certainly impaired, but not to any noticeable degree.  On the other hand, I've started to feel noticeably impaired, no self-assessment required, at 70' in 45F pea soup.

scuba,36kcdn,duckmuffins,1 point,Wed May 20 14:11:27 2015 UTC,"Others have good advice which should be heeded here, but technically speaking, with PADI OW you're not ""certified to 60ft."" There's a ""recommended"" max depth ""for new divers"" of 18m/60ft, but with OW, you're a fully certified recreational diver and the certification has no limit, and PADI's line is that ""you should not exceed the limits of your training or experience."" You should be able to to plan an execute a dive to the max OW depth (something like 130ft). Doing so is undoubtedly a really bad idea at this point; but if you took a non-certification class to 100ft or below, with a qualified instructor training you, you can fully do so on your OW cert."

scuba,36kcdn,PCGCentipede,0,Wed May 20 04:15:55 2015 UTC,"Question: is this a PADI dive shop? If it is, they are violating PADI standards and this is very serious (for PADI and the dive shop).   I'm a PADI instructor and if there is one thing that is drilled into us when doing our instructor course it's that PADI's standards are NEVER TO BE BROKEN especially if you want to get PADI's full backing/protection in the case of an accident. If something happens to an OW diver and it is determined that he/she was at 61ft (I'm dead serious) when it happened, the instructor/divemaster is in some deep shit. The insurance coverage you had? Forget it. The legal coverage? HAHA GONE!   I mentioned higher up that the violation was serious for PADI and the dive shop. The reason is simple: PADI sets standards that are based on their research into risk management. They make and revise these standards according to new developments in equipment, statistics from incident reports, and legal considerations. By setting strict standards, PADI is covering their butt (and the instructor/divemaster's) by making those standards well above what is safe in order to make sure that if something does happen, it's not their fault. You might be asking, ""ok, but 80ft in these water conditions aren't very different than 60ft"" and you're probably right. The real question you should be asking yourself is the following: if the shop doesn't follow PADI's basic safety standards, what else are they not doing?"

scuba,36i2cr,Roosty37,5,Tue May 19 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"While mammals in captivity are a little tough for me, having fish and rays and sharks in an aquarium, especially in one as interactive as aquarium encounters, really does help promote education,awareness and respect of the marine world. Not everyone is blessed enough to be able to experience the magic of the ocean first hand and even fewer will see mobula rays, as they are an extremely shy species, so I think aquariums where The animals are well cared for and respected can be a wonderful thing."

scuba,36jtwh,Bigwhistle,-7,Thu May 21 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"Don't take any equipment except regulator, mask, snorkel and fins. Most shops rent the rest for a very modest fee, and you don't have to schlep all the other stuff in your luggage, and maybe pay overweight charges. That being said, as novice divers, I urge you to get more experience in the U.S. before doing open water dives in a foreign country. Every aspect of a diving emergency is less likely to proceed effectively in Costa Rica. Do you even know if there is and where the local recompression chamber is?"

Bring your own gear, tell the shop that you only have few dives, make sure the amount of people per dive master is maximum 6-8.  Dont dive if you feel scared, abort dive is it feels too hard (current, temperature, scary fishes).  If you feel that the shop is unsafe, walk out and go to the next shop. :-D  The rest is about as hard as a beach holiday. Holiday diving is the easiest way to get into scuba, so have fun.   P.S. Bring a dive hood/beanie, boat hat and sun screen that sticks underwater. Burned forehead is reality after the 1st day."

Hope you've got equivalent credentials. I've been with the on-call DAN MD for many calls as part of my training, and I can tell you many, not all, were from frightened tourists or their friends or family members, overseas, diving in an unfamiliar environment, and trying to negotiate emergency care. <<<We haven't actually done any diving yet other than the lessons, so keep that in mind.>>> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

So technically you are dead. However, i find it quite hilarious that table tennis has higher fatality rate than ""extreme sport"" reef scuba.   Last year I did about 120 hours of holiday reef dives, all over really. I blew my knee in the phillippines while climbing the boat, so the year ended being too much reddit. Been doing this for about 4 year now, travel and dive. I am a full time leisure travel diver if you want to throw a label.  Emergencies are extremely rare. I havent seen a single DCS or bleeding ear.  And this includes all the chinese peeps who CANNOT SWIM... I mean, talking about breathing sinkers.   The longest floating wait was 20 minutes. I have zero 5min penalty decos due dive masters, or currents.   Closest to a diving emergency was one old dude who jumped the boat without his fins and I brought them to him at 5m sand bottom. Pretty funny, actually.   Supervised diving in the tropics is probably safer than OWs going on their own straight after the certs. I mean, look at this sand pit training dive site (the killer is at 4min). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_YmZ11hKo  Also, I m heading to Malta next to do the cave certs. Unsupervised shorediving is really popular there, and there are already 3 dead people this year on the scubaboard accidents."

All of the shops that I have used or been affiliated with do (which maybe accounts for 0.0001% of the worlds shops).  Even if the resort you are going to does not offer a computer rental, you can always rent from your local dive shop for the duration of the trip. Assuming you rent a computer, make sure to go the manufacturers web site and download the manual to your tablet/laptop/smart phone once you know the model so you can familiarize yourself with it.  I periodically crew on a liveaboard dive boat and we always tell people before we leave the dock to make sure to download their computer manual. Many people have one they are unfamiliar with because it is a rental unit. Between the crew we have seen/used many different models so we can typically (but not always) help them even when they don't have the manual.   Since PADI is now teaching computer use directly in the OW class, I would expect more of the PADI shops that do not rent computers to start renting them."

The DM that was on the boat was also exceptionally patient with some of the people who were there to snorkel but ended up doing a discover dive.   We stayed at the Intercon and it was an easy 10 minute walk from the dive shop. I think the Intercon had it's own water sport club thing but we weren't interested in that. The price was pretty reasonable and we saw lots of awesome corals, fish, and wrecks. Highly recommend them. :)  I'm not 100% on the monastery but we did Petra and hired a car/driver through the concierge at the hotel. Was well worth the money.

There's a lot of garbage info in here about security.  I live and work in Cairo. We are in close concert with the US, British, and EU embassies as well as Egyptian Police and military and the big companies working here in Egypt.  My work takes me all over Egypt.  The point is I'm pretty current on this.  Step one: contact your embassy and get suggestions and advice on the routes and locations you want to travel.  St Catherine's is the destination I want to visit most and I haven't been because that road is such a hazard to foreigners, even during daylight hours.  There's a war going on in the mountains and people are beheaded constantly.  Oddly enough, Sharm el Sheikh and Dahab are safe as can be.  The road to Israel isn't too bad right now from what I hear.  You can fly from Sharm to a ton of other places.  The majority of Egypt is safe right now.  The Sinai is mostly dangerous as hell.  Contact your embassy.  I was out on the Sinai for work a couple weeks ago, it was sketchy as fuck and we were in armed and armored convoys (against our wishes, we prefer to be low key but the Egyptians understandably do not want to lose one of us).  You can't tell who is hostile just by looking at them.  Some tribals are more dependable than family, some will cut your throat for the 20 in your wallet or of you are like me, American and Christian, for the principle of the thing.  Lastly:  be alert here as a woman.  Most Egyptians are some of the best people you could meet by chance on a lonely road or back alley, willing to give up their homes to make you comfortable.  The minority that aren't are predatory in ways most westerners aren't prepared for.  My wife is extremely careful here.  Know where you are going, travel during daylight, only use very reputable tour guides and hotels.  Let hotels arrange taxis.  Not every taxi is legit.  Some will take you to the edge of town and ditch you with some cash to get home and nothing else, some much worse.  Stick to what is verified and you will be fine.  Feel free to PM me any specific questions.  Contact your embassy!"

I've done one dive with them this year and it all went pretty smooth for the most part despite some of the negative reviews is seen and heard. As for there actual certification process and price I'm not too sure. I got my SSI OW cert in December through nu horizons dive and travel in myrtle beach. They are fantastic. The staff and instructors are knowledgeable and are willing to work around your schedule and make your certification process very enjoyable.  The OW class costs around $350 and they have a mask/fins/snorkel/boots package for under $150. They also have an indoor heated dive tank that is great for doing mask and buoyancy skills in the winter. It may be a good idea to stop by the places your trying to get certified through and meet the staff and pick the one that feels right.

Everything you're doing is not just a waste of time but actually hurting your decision making ability when it comes time to try them on and pick the one that fits the best. Every preconceived notion you develop makes it harder to make the right choice.  Later, when you're an old hand at this, you may not care about a mask that leaks a little bit and can worry about some other things but new divers don't handle leaky masks well and that's the only thing you should be focused on right now."

Wear it with the strap slack. A good mask is wonderful but a mask that doesn't fit well becomes totally evil after an hour in the water.  My current mask is an unbranded cheapy.

scuba,36dzsh,llaskin,2,Mon May 18 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"I'm more worried about the price than the total and complete depletion of helium reserves. The helium reserve in Texas is 1/3rd of the entire current helium supply. Having a gov't mandated cap on the price artificially keeping the price lower until the end of this year is a little troubling, as well as the fact that the price cap basically crowded out potential helium extractors over the last few decades. So there's no real infrastructure, a shortage of supply and increase in demand, we can't actually produce more and can only capture from gas extraction byproduct, and there's no more imposed cap on the price after 2015.   ""Since 2000 there have been three helium crises when the supply chain has become bottlenecked, and we are in one right now.  But let us be clear. These are short-term shortages caused by upstream market disturbances, not long-term problems. Partly these disruptions can be traced back to the HPA’s pricing mechanism and the BLM’s large market share. This, some argue,  has dissuaded helium refiners from entering or staying in the market.

scuba,36gn28,ivyliciousme,4,Tue May 19 06:15:59 2015 UTC,good article http://divedir.com/Skills-articles/buoyancy-control-tips.html
scuba,36gn28,chokolad,3,Tue May 19 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"First of all: relax, it sounds like you're too stressed about your air consumption and that alone will make it worse. It will improve over time as you get more experienced.  Secondly: the trick is to find the rhythm, start breathing in when you start to sink, start breathing out when you're starting to rise. There is inertia, a delay between starting to breathe in(out) and rising(sinking) that you can use."
scuba,36gn28,mxa020,2,Tue May 19 08:18:27 2015 UTC,"This.   All buoyancy (positive or negative) is a force, and F=ma ... your mass has inertia which will take some time before you'll actually start to noticeably move - and while this isn't really long, the rhythm thats referred to above is that you'll learn to inhale while sinking, which will reverse its course and exhale when rising to trim that out too.  The second part is that huge breaths are rare - just like in everyday life:  as suggested, breathe normally (and chill out & relax).    BTW, if one is close enough to the bottom to risk crashing into it because of buoyancy control variations, that's too close for now.    What the OP will learn as time goes on is to anticipate their ""altitude"" (above the bottom) needs - as one swims along and sees a change in terrain, one can use breath control to rise (or sink) to clear obstacles (eg, reef ridges, etc) and otherwise reduce the need to use swimming force to make these same changes."
scuba,36gn28,-hh,1 point,Tue May 19 12:08:44 2015 UTC,"I was taught to exhale completely in order to sink to the bottom. If I am reading all the comments right, I should never exhale completely but hold half a lung of air and use it like my own natural bcd?"
scuba,36gn28,-hh,1 point,Wed May 20 10:05:25 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  If you need a full exhale (or inhale) to do something, then do so.  But for the rest of the time, your breathing should be ""normal"", which scientifically is less than a 100% of capacity."
scuba,36gn28,nigelh,2,Wed May 20 12:22:12 2015 UTC,"Put yourself horizontal in the water. That slows down all up and down movement.  Also I think you're overdoing it. You are not supposed to blow yourself up like a Zeppelin and then empty yourself right out just breath normally. The thing they are teaching you is not to do small breaths, which is a problem, and beginners tend to do it that way.  There is masses of oxygen in a breath at depth but what you want to do is flush out all that nasty CO2 which shallow, fast breathing won't do. Keep it slow but never stop breathing and it will all work."
scuba,36gn28,richiericardo,2,Tue May 19 09:40:11 2015 UTC,"It's more breathing in the middle.  Make good strong inhale and exhales,  similar to normal breathing, maybe a bit stronger.  But don't inhale all the way and don't exhale all the way.  This leaves you the lung capacity to bring in or released more breath.  Allowing you to control your up and down motion.   Before that though make sure you've got your gear and weighting configured properly.  It takes time and practice to get used to using your breath as a tool. Have fun and dive safe."
scuba,36gn28,Lergerndery,1 point,Tue May 19 10:59:08 2015 UTC,Becareful with that quick ascension. The biggest volumetric change is in the first 30ft of water. That's actually the most dangerous. Instead of focusing on exhaling everything and inhaling until you pop just relax and breathe normally. Get veritcal. You probably have too much weight which is a common problem with new divers. try to ditch some weight and remember to adjust your bc so that you're neutrally bouyant. Think of the BC as a coarse adjuster though and your lungs as fine tuning. Get in a pool and practice hovering right about the bottom without finning or using your hands the stay in position. With enough practice you'll get it.

scuba,36gn28,Lergerndery,1 point,Tue May 19 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"Normal range is all based on multiple factors including your weight, body fat percentage, type of exposure suit, size of tank (a 15l tank weighs 2kg (4lb6oz) more than a 12l tank), etc, etc.   You've already had a ton of good advice re: buoyancy so no need for me to add anything else, but thought I should comment on this as I, being a 6'2"" guy carrying a bit of a gut, dive with 8kg (17lb 10oz) when wearing a 5mm full wet suit with hood, boots and gloves."

scuba,36gn28,murkleton,1 point,Wed May 20 09:43:08 2015 UTC,Yeah once you get your bouyancy control down you should be able to drop your weight to 6lbs and then 4lb with more practice. You only want the minimum amount of weight to get you down to depth. Once you get to a certain point your suit compresses and you really don't need that much. The more weight you have the more bouyancy issues you'll have the more air you'll use. Work on getting your BC properly inflated for neutral bouyancy. Once you have it set you really shouldn't have to touch it unless you change depth.
scuba,36gn28,totallydonner,1 point,Wed May 20 10:02:33 2015 UTC,"Just breathe the way you'd breathe above the water and you'll be fine. You'll be less of a yo-yo, you'll feel less stressed and you'll enjoy your dives a whole lot more! And, another bonus: you'll be able to dive longer with your tank since you'll be wasting less air."

scuba,36d5v1,N0VA_PR1ME,2,Mon May 18 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"Buy trip insurance if you go during hurricane season -- cheap and easy.  Time of year for optimum diving is very location-specific -- even more so than, say, ""Caribbean"" vs. ""Red Sea"".  E.g., whale sharks may visit one location at one time and another at a different time. Currents may shift annually and worse viz to location X when location Y in the same general area of the globe is untouched. And so on.   But: tons of places in the caribbean have great diving Oct-Dec. Cozumel is where I've done the most winter diving and it was always great. Plus Christmas in Mexico is a freakin' blast"
scuba,36d5v1,ethanjf99,1 point,Mon May 18 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, trip insurance is an easy fix to the hurricane problem. I was just throwing it out there because it is the most common weather to ruin an entire dive trip which seemed to be his big worry.  Mexico is definitely a great option during winter but I'd personally not do just Cozumel but add Playa Del Carmen for the seasonal bull shark diving and Cancun for the seasonal Sailfish freediving. Also, typically flights are cheaper to Cancun and between the buses going to Playa Del Carmen and then ferries going to Cozumel it's not too hard to dive all three."
scuba,36d5v1,N0VA_PR1ME,2,Wed May 20 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"+1.  Every location has variations, and what constitutes good vs bad isn't an absolute ... spring algae blooms are bad for pretty ""blue water"" photography and wide angle, but if you're looking for big plankton eaters (eg mantas, whale sharks), the same bloom will probably be an attractant.  For mid-October and the Caribbean, this is the fall ""Shoulder season"" where tourism drops off because schools have begun...plus there's some hurricane risks.  But the fall is also a time of warm water with cooler topside temperatures (a nice combination) and depending on where you're at, you could have pretty good odds of the summer-winter transition resulting in a stalemate where the winds die and you have glass conditons.  Or you could hit a tropical wave cycle where there's a heavy downpour every day at 11am.  Or you might do a two week stay and get both.  Case in point, in the Cayman's ""sister"" islands (Brac & Little), I personally prefer the fall over pretty much anytime of year.  Of course, 2015 might not bea good year to recommend this, as Brac Reef Beach Resort is going to be closed for major renovations this Aug-early Nov, although the dive operation is going to remain open."

scuba,36d5v1,CanadianDiver,1 point,Mon May 18 22:58:29 2015 UTC,True enough ... but remember to dive with the direction of the wind so  the boat isn't blown too far from you when you exit :)

scuba,36ddpa,mxa020,1 point,Mon May 18 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Same here: I made a few hundred dives wearing (hard) contact lenses. Never a problem. I had problems with dust, sand when not diving but never during a dive."
scuba,36ddpa,dsheedy,8,Mon May 18 18:48:24 2015 UTC,"I wear contacts when I'm diving, as did my instructor. Just be sure to let them know before you start. When I was doing the course, for any skill that involved me removing my mask, I would keep my eyes closed.  The following is taken from DAN's website.   What are the best contact lenses to wear underwater?  Divers who wish to wear contact lenses while diving should ask their ophthalmologists or optometrists to prescribe ""soft"" contact lenses. ""Hard"" lenses or rigid gas-permeable lenses, the other two commonly prescribed types of lenses, have been found to sometimes cause symptoms of eye pain and blurred vision during and after dives, in which the diver accumulates a significant inert gas load. These symptoms occur as a result of gas bubbles forming between the cornea and the contact lens."
scuba,36ddpa,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-1,Mon May 18 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"You kept your eyes closed? I don't think they should have allowed you to do that. And I'm saying that wearing contacts as a diver as well.   One of the aims of the mask removal exercise is to show that you'd be able to safely get out of a situation where you lost your mask, and keeping your eyes closed just isn't always safe.   If you're not prepared to risk losing your lenses, you shouldn't dive with lenses."
scuba,36ddpa,butterbal1,3,Mon May 18 21:01:09 2015 UTC,The skill is specifically dealing with having your nose exposed to the water directly and then replacing the mask and clearing it.  Doing it with eyes closed makes it a tad bit harder and could be like doing the skill in the blinding cloud of silt most noobies seem to love kicking up.
scuba,36ddpa,JoshKehn,4,Mon May 18 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Soft contacts (which I wear) are perfectly fine in the pool whether scuba diving or just swimming (with goggles).   The key to not losing your contacts in the water is simply keeping your eyes closed. Water has a tendency to wash out contacts. Once that happens, you're not going to find them again and you'll need to replace it. Bring some backups and you should be fine.  If you'd rather wear glasses there are lens mounts (like tack) that you can stick the lenses inside the mask. You can also find specialized masks and whatnot if you'd prefer to not wear contacts when diving."
scuba,36ddpa,cmw69krinkle,1 point,Mon May 18 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"lens mounts (like tack) that you can stick the lenses inside the mask.    Is this something where you take your lenses out of your glasses and glue them to your mask? If so, can you provide a link or product name? I'd like to get some of that."
scuba,36ddpa,JoshKehn,1 point,Mon May 18 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My google-fu is failing right now but I thought I saw this in a store.  Alternatively, and with absolutely no knowledge on how it functions under pressure and in various gas mixtures Sugru is my go-to bonding thing. You'd probably be able to take the lenses out, put them in the mask, and surround that with a bit of sugru to adhere. It's easily removable as well."
scuba,36ddpa,writing_emphasis,4,Mon May 18 16:52:24 2015 UTC,You could also look into getting prescription lenses intalled in your mask. I did that a couple years ago and have been very happy with the result.
scuba,36ddpa,Autorotator,3,Mon May 18 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would take this option too.  You don't want to be losing your lenses to be the first link in an incident chain.  JMO, people seem to be doing well with it, I'm just tedious with risk aversion."
scuba,36ddpa,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Mon May 18 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"Before you lose a contact, you need to lose your mask. So you're far more likely to use those prescription lenders than your contacts. In addition, you limit your choice of mask, you can't see anything during the surface interval."
scuba,36ddpa,CanuckDiver84,2,Mon May 18 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'm also very happy with my prescription lenses.  Pricey, yes, but I'll take that over losing a contact (or both) if my mask gets kicked off my face."
scuba,36ddpa,kroneksix,1 point,Mon May 18 19:07:45 2015 UTC,It might just be me. But I would rather risk losing a contact and have spares on shore. Than have a thousand dollar mask that would be far more easily broken or lost. Plus I can see as soon as I get on shore/the boat.
scuba,36ddpa,writing_emphasis,2,Mon May 18 22:43:54 2015 UTC,My lenses weren't anywhere near $1000.
scuba,36ddpa,Doub1eAA,3,Tue May 19 02:12:40 2015 UTC,I wear contacts. I spoke with my ophthalmologist   and he was okay with it as well. He preferred that I used daily lenses while diving and traveling.
scuba,36ddpa,sinverguenza,2,Mon May 18 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"I have a regular mask to use with contact lenses, and a prescription mask for when I don't feel like dealing with contacts. Both work out great!"
scuba,36ddpa,Nurum,2,Mon May 18 17:50:58 2015 UTC,Honestly just pay Sea Vision to custom make you a mask. Before I had surgery on my eyes I had them make me one. They actually ground the glass of the mask rather then just sticking a lens inside of it. I think it was about $300 (back in 2002) but it was totally worth it because your field of vision was much better. And it looked like a normal mask until you put it on.   They also added the rose colored glass and something called DeMag that got rid of the magnification effect of normal masks.
scuba,36ddpa,RdmGuy64824,2,Mon May 18 22:29:41 2015 UTC,Having an issue with contacts underwater would not be fun.  I would consider buying a mask with prescription lenses.

scuba,36ddpa,chippedbeefontoast,1 point,Mon May 18 22:16:07 2015 UTC,"what everyone else has said; just adding that they make prescription mask lenses if you prefer. I take on a trip: * my contacts * backup pair of contacts in case the first wash out on a dive * a spare mask with prescription lenses just in case  If you were REALLY paranoid or doing a challenging dive you could pack the spare prescription mask along on your dive. Contacts wash out? Whip out the prescription mask, put it on, and continue your dive.  I mostly do relaxing warm-water tourist diving so this isn't necessary. But if I were doing tech diving, say, I'd absolutely take the prescription mask along. Would not want to be 200 feet down in cold water, with current, inside a wreck, and adding fuzzy vision to the list of challenges. Actually, if I were doing tech diving I'd probably get the surgery. :)"

It was a shock as we'd only seen reef sharks before and in Sharm they're relatively shy in comparison. I recognised what it was straight away, and when it started circling the group at quite a quick pace we all knew it did not give a shit. In our moment of awe/shock we were oblivious to the instructor banging on his tank trying to signal us to get to the reef as quickly as possible. When we noticed what he was doing, that's when it really hit home that this was a hairy situation. I will never forget that dive.  One of the group,  who was completely unphased by it, was taking that video but realised he wasn't recording until the last minute when he got it swimming away.

I started out local diving with trips to Haigh Quarry in Kankakee area. It is a good place to start. Major ""wrecks"" there are marked with buoys in case you get lost. The last few times I have gone though, the visibility was pretty bad. I have done some Lake Michigan wreck diving through Dive Right In Scuba in association with Double Action Dive Charters in Hammond Indiana. Lake Michigan wreck dives are very cool. The wrecks are very much preserved so they are in great condition, many of which are in less than 50ft of water.

scuba,36b3h9,SeasDiver,1 point,Wed May 20 07:56:08 2015 UTC,Also relevant is technique.   Many people haven't been shown how to properly use a light.  You don't shine the brightest part of the beam directly on what you're looking at because you don't want to blind it.  You want to put the bright beam to the side of what you're looking at so what you're looking at gets a bit of ambient light.
scuba,36b3h9,nigelh,1 point,Mon May 18 09:53:29 2015 UTC,I use Sola lights. They have 3 brightness settings so I can adjust it to my needs.   The Sola photo light that I have can also switch between white flood (3 brightness levels) and red (3 brightness levels). The red is great for sneaking up on things as they do not tend to react to it the way they do to white light. The red can also highlight eyes on shrimp/crabs to make them easier to find.

Also fairly fished out, so not as much life. On the Mykonos dives (GoDive Mykonos) we did a nice wreck dive that was about 100ft / 30m, the Anna II and also a dive where we got to see amphorae that were hundreds of years old (just look, no touching).  The Santorini dives were mostly swimthrus of lava formations and some fish. Interesting but not amazing to me.  Diving in Greece is still pretty new due to archaeological laws, so both times the diving companies weren't as well outfitted as the ones I've been with in Hawaii, but it was still neat to go do."

scuba,366x5e,Selene212,2,Sat May 16 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"If you only have your Open Water rating, you could only go as deep as 18 meters. If you plan on getting your Advanced Open Water certification to be able to go deeper, then you could get a fancier underwater camera set up -- it would cost a fortune, but I don't know your circumstances. I spent $400 on my UW equipment and I had fun with it. Canon G12, internal flash and the Canon UW case with the diffuser.  I've only gone on dive trips in Honduras and Southeast Asia, so I can't tell if renting gear is the more cost-effective way to go in Aus. Carrying your own gear sounds stressful to me, but I always find myself hoping I brought my own wetsuit and a dive computer (or 2) because those are quite personal items.  If you have already contacted a dive shop, ask them instead what you need to bring for your trip. They would know better :)  Enjoy!

scuba,366x5e,cassied21,3,Tue May 19 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"Okay-key words stuck out here-you just got your certification. That being said rent your gear while you're there if you don't already have gear. No point in bringing gear and paying extra fees for gear that you're not even acclimated to yet. Since you are so new  and your trip date is around the corner I'd worry about the trip itself and not the gear. The trip out to the reef is a long one. Even if you think you are use to being in boats buy sea sickness meds. You won't feel like diving if you're sea sick. The newness of diving, the trip, being on a boat can all be nerve wracking. Save yourself and money by purchasing motion sickness meds. Do it! Having worked in dive boats take this advice! No having been to the Great Barrier Reef I suggest you use Pro Dive. They will use a large ferry to bring you out to their main boat. Again take Dramamine. So many people got sick on the ride out. Don't over pack.  Quick points: Bring sunscreen, 2 bathing suits, they will have towels, there will be food on board, sunglasses, hat, book, do buy yourself a decent rash guard, but a watch that is waterproof. I would say your first purchases ""if"" you feel you want to buy and being things should be these: a good set of mask, snorkel, fins. I prefer MARES fins. Oceanic Shadow mask. Snorkel test on your own.  Since you are so new I actually don't suggest to purchases a bigger/better camera. Use what you have until you feel comfortable in the water. Since you are new you most likely will be doing two things: either focusing on your new skills And forget about taking photos or you're concentrating on taking photos and not paying attention to your gauges.  I DO highly suggest to take this time to take more classes with the dive shop  what a perfect place to take a buoyancy class, advanced open water, naturalist class, reef I'd, etc. all the while seeing the reef and having a guide at the same time. I really do suggest this since you are so new. I actually think all of your dives should be in a class or guided if you really want to enjoy yourself. Again, Divemaster here and have seen all the good and bad of new divers taking trips like this. If you really want photos then leave it to the pros on board. Hire them or take a uw photo class that way you can take photos or they can take photos of you diving.  Some tips if you're not use to being out at sea: motion sucks meds should be taken a few hours ahead of time. DO NOT stay inside the bathroom (head) if you're seasick. Puke overboard. Lay outside take in the air. Watch people and keep your mind occupied. Drink lots of water the entire trip! And for goodness sake...stay with your buddy."

scuba,366x5e,PunkorTrendy,2,Tue May 19 05:48:09 2015 UTC,"The more gear that you can afford and bring, the more comfortable you will be. I'd suggest a computer first because many rentals don't have them, and then you're stuck to tables... which sucks for bottom time.  As far as the camera, I'd go with a GoPro (comes with housing to I believe 100m) unless you want to really start getting crazy with prices. My housing and lighting for my video system, which isn't all that special, was as much money as my BCD and reg put together. The Great Barrier Reef is quite a big place, I'm sure you can find a good outfit to go out with. Reviews for dive shops are usually very honest, so I'd start there."

scuba,366x5e,IForgotWhoIAm,1 point,Tue May 19 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"Suit can also be Location/Personal preference dependent.    I.e. if you normally dive cold water and have a 7mm semi-dry, and are only doing 1 trip to a 'warm' location (GBR was ~27°C last time I was there) then you might be better off hiring that suit. I own a 2mm Thermo Core top, 3mm long and a 5mm Semi-Dry, because I dive in warmish and semi-cold areas often enough to warrant it.    Definitely get a computer though. Learn how to use it too. Diving with a comfortable computer, that you know, is better than doing tables on a bottom timer. Or learning how to use a new computer every dive."

scuba,366igj,corb3au,6,Sat May 16 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"It sure is true that the instructor matters most. But you have to ask yourself, where would I most likely find the best instructor for what I'm interested in? The answer is that that instructor is more likely found in a shop / club which is dedicated to tech diving. In other words, GUE, BSAC, or TDI.  To be a good tech diver, and not just be qualified for it, you definitely need a peer group, such as a club. That's not something you can pick up on the cheap in terms of a cert card. And once you have a club, go with whatever cert agency your club members suggest."
scuba,366igj,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Sat May 16 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"A good quality course is good because of the instructor, not the agency. When starting on the technical journey it's important (IMHO) to find someone who you get on with, and you trust. Recommendations are really useful here.   Once you've found someone, take a course under whichever agency they teach.   Personally I've got qualifications under PADI, BSAC, SDI, IANTD and TDI. It's only the recreational qualifications (PADI / BSAC) where the agency mattered at all because their standards were different at the different levels."

Even so, it was a live drop from the boat who didn't venture all that near, so it involved a pretty good swim in & back out for pickup.

The key thing this gives you is not being a silt kicker. (Silt kicker being the ultimate pejorative for a diver.) This level of positional control is pretty crucial doing wreck penetration or cave so I suppose you could make it a prerequisite for many technical dives but I can fix your trim in ten minutes so it's not really a big deal.  Propulsion. There are lots of ways to fin with different applications but the key form of propulsion that I use in extreme sites isn't even considered. I term it 'finger walking'. My fins stop doing the work and I very gently pull myself through the site. The moment I want to go under something my hands take over because I don't want to nudge anything and damage the place for the next guy. Because I know how big I am this means I can near miss everything. Now I probably don't look cool or fabulous but if I can go in through holes and, more importantly, get out through holes I'm pretty happy with it.  What I'm not happy with here is promoting this as 'Technical Diving'. I am not a person who believes that the quality of your buoyancy and trim defines you as a diver. This is a very pretty style of diving but Technical diving is about managing non-clear surface environments, either you are inside a wreck or a cave or the 'glass ceiling' of decompression obligations has closed over you plus it is almost inevitably pitch dark so navigation back out is a problem to consider. I see people practising this trim and finning of stuff in a few meters of water and congratulating one another on it as an accomplishment. OK, it must be fun to be able to do it but that is what I mean by 'synchronised swimming' as it is performing to a set style. It can be beautifully done, as in the video, but it is just another tool in you diving toolbox and it's not really that an important tool because we.... Well I was going to say we can all do buoyancy and finning but I do confess to seeing some notable exceptions over the years but we should be able to."
scuba,3615kv,nigelh,5,Fri May 15 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"Irrespective of what you call this.. It is fundamental to good diving. You can't get this degree of control without firmly understanding buoyancy, weighting and finning. Technical or not, it's clearly good practise.  What's concerning is that you can work your way through to the senior echelons of popular certification agencies without any strong focus on developing these skills. As said time and time again on the forum, make sure you find instructors who will specifically focus on developing these fundamentals.. because the course curriculum doesn't."
scuba,3615kv,mrenage,3,Sat May 16 08:56:48 2015 UTC,I agree. That's why I didn't call this technical diving but simply diving techniques. Moving appropriately with your surroundings is made much easier with good trim and setup.
scuba,3615kv,murkleton,2,Fri May 15 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"We dive quarries in the UK when the weather is too bad to hit the North Sea and it gets pretty packed in them sometimes. I find it shocking how many 'technical divers' that are using twin sets/rebreathers flutter kicking away with a trail of silt behind them.  Agreed this isn't technical diving, there should be a natural progression towards this style when you dive. I don't even think you should be considering tech diving without this kind of control. Plus you look like a goddam ninja in the water."
scuba,3615kv,pinch-n-roll,1 point,Fri May 15 22:35:36 2015 UTC,I'm interested in how you define what makes a recreational diver good or bad.

scuba,3615kv,nigelh,1 point,Sun May 17 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"While weight positioning is important to good trim, you can't fix bad trim just by moving the weights around. You still have to bring your knees up and consciously hold them there.  About your finger walking, many caves have pretty delicate features and that is discouraged ."
scuba,3615kv,-hh,1 point,Sun May 17 11:19:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've tried adjusting weights. Once it's right it just works. You just are basically straight and bend at the knees to place your fins horizontal. It does feel very 'feet light' to begin with but that just because we're the sort of creature that spends most of its life anchored feet down. If you have to put effort into staying horizontal you are doing it wrong.  Finger walking? Finning in a confined space is usually the recipe for leaving a trail of destruction behind you. I would only fin when I have loads of clearance, like a meter more than a slot I'd fit through. Yes I am careful where I put my hands."
scuba,3615kv,nigelh,1 point,Sun May 17 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"Some good points here.  One I'll highlight is the assumption that ""flat horizontal"" is the ideal trim orientation, at the expense of all other considerations.  That's actually an optimization for a particular set of diving and is not necessarily universally important (or even desirable) for all forms of diving.    For example, the ""fins high"" and accompanying fins strokes that go along with this are great for moving slow and in a constrained and silt-prone (eg overhead) environment...but if you're trying to put down power against a current (or to intercept an animal), the thrust vector is all wrong.  Similarly, if you're on a drift with a current, streamlining and the like don't mean squat because your movement vs the current is nearly zero.    The real tool in the diver's toolbox is self-awareness of body and control thereof.  The rest are just examples of implementation for certain use cases and priorities...for these implementations, there is no single ""the only correct"" trim, kick, or whatever."
scuba,3615kv,kroneksix,1 point,Sat May 16 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's very pretty but it isn't ""Technical"" Diving, it is a very stylistic style of diving which places form above function. This is the synchronised swimming of scuba and probably makes a great hobby but isn't needed for what are reasonably described as technical dives."
scuba,3615kv,bowshikabowow,8,Fri May 15 09:44:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your ""synchronized swimming"" of scuba, but agree with its not ""technical diving""   Good trim and propulsion techniques are critical for all diving. Good trim will make you streamlined in the water, allowing you to move with less effort and save gas for longer dive times. Good propulsion will keep you from kicking up silt and mud, reducing visibility to everyone behind you. Finally both will keep you from hitting potentially easily damaged coral or other underwater formations that we should avoid hitting.   Every diver should strive to have excellent trim and propulsion on every dive. Each course I DM I have a small ""workshop"" about trim and propulsion. The students that get it are markedly better divers after their final certification dives than divers that don't get it. This is all done under the direct supervision and permission of the instructor to maintain standards of course."
scuba,3615kv,kroneksix,4,Fri May 15 14:05:12 2015 UTC,Having good trim and propulsion techniques are a cornerstone to technical diving. Not having these basic techniques as second nature before getting into tech diving seems like a very bad idea to me. Wreck or cave diving without these would be suicidal.

I know some agencies allow a few degrees off trim and + or - a few feet when holding a stop and have those standards tightened as they progress and they get their shit together. I'm just saying that by the time it's tech diving time, it should be this level."

All my second stages (12 of them so far) are Apeks XTX50's. My first stages are a mixture of Tek3's, DST's, and DS4's.  For technical diving all your first stages need to be DIN and should be as matched as possible as you will be using all of them- especially when in a cave diving sidemount and you switch back and forth throughout the dive."

scuba,360m5f,stds9tng,2,Sat May 16 03:29:17 2015 UTC,Hog second stages are in the same price range and would be better performing since they are balanced with metal barrels and cracking adjustment.  The Hollis 212 is also a decent second stage that is a good value and your oceanic dealer would be able to service it.
scuba,360m5f,runsongas,1 point,Fri May 15 03:46:29 2015 UTC,Hollis is notably inexpensive during sales... Last Black Friday it was $99.   Is there a difference between the Zenith and D1?
scuba,360m5f,SarcasticOptimist,2,Sat May 16 02:32:41 2015 UTC,Zenith is a second stage and d1 is a first stage. D1 is an older first that us similar to a DST apeks first. Zenith is a newer version second compared to the classic second that is usually sold with the newer d3 first stage. The classic second and d1 is a very good value from cave adventurers or dris.
scuba,360m5f,runsongas,2,Sat May 16 03:23:08 2015 UTC,My preference was always to have identical primaries/secondaries and swap them round regularly because the secondary gets a worse life than the primary and probably needs to be made of stern stuff so it will still work on the day you call on it.

I've tried almost all the other regs out there at that level, XTX50/100/200/Black Sapphire, A700 Scubapro, Atomic something or other... I love my S600s. I was so close to buying some Apeks stuff, but after trying them, I'm glad I stuck with my S600s. Try some out, though. I used to swear by my Sherwood SR2s until I tried this Mk25/S600 combo.  I know you're talking about cheaper regs, but that last sentence in your post makes me talk about this level. If you're hinting at going into some more technical diving like cave and wreck, you're going to want gear that will stand the test of time and typically are sealed, though I know some people who still love a mk25. I know two or three very prevalent cavers who love an S600/Mk17 or Mk25 Evo combo. I also know one big deal fellow who uses Apeks first stages and Scubapro second. If you're looking to go into bigger, badder diving, look into buying bigger, badder gear to start so you're not rebuying in a year.   I'll skimp on fins, knives, maybe save a few bucks on BC stuff as long as it's comfortable and floats me. But one thing that better be 100% is my regs. If my BC fails, I can still get to the surface without a panic situation. If my fins fail, I'll move like an idiot, but I can make it work. Mask? Same deal. Regs? That's a true emergency.

We stayed in some huts, the only accommodation on the beach. No electricity except for a generator for a few hours. No TV, no running water. They kept the beer cold though. And there was a makeshift volleyball court which was the primary source of recreation out of the water. There were maybe 3 or 4 of these places on the entire island, all the same, all on their own isolated beach. And a local fishing village on the other side of the island. The diving was brilliant, absolutely pristine.  The instructors there were dive instructors for 6 months, then when the monsoon came in they were surfers and surf instructors. What a life.

scuba,35ydt2,lookatmycamels,2,Fri May 15 02:19:28 2015 UTC,Happened to me and was bad enough that I had to surface after descending to 5m on a dive once. It could be an aerosinusitis.   On my dive I wasn't congested in any way but on the descent it felt like someone had rammed a knife into my face.   I sat out the dive on the boat and went down for the second dive and had to just hold and squeeze as hard as I could until I had air bubbles coming out of my tear ducts and I felt a pop and the sinus pain cleared immediately.   Sometimes for whatever reason small air pockets can get trapped and make equalization difficult.
scuba,35ydt2,lookatmycamels,1 point,Thu May 14 19:16:09 2015 UTC,Isn't sqeezing hard bad? You could rupture your Tymphanic membrane
scuba,35ydt2,murkleton,1 point,Fri May 15 02:20:40 2015 UTC,Depends on how you do it. I wasn't plugging and then blowing as hard as I could all at once. I gradually increased the pressure and I could feel my ears clearing but I kept going until I heard a pop in my sinus and the pain went away.
scuba,35ydt2,Happy_McStabby,2,Fri May 15 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Not a doctor! Sinus squeeze can happen, especially if you're congested. It's generally not serious (but not recommended either!) Sometimes there can be a little blood in your mask afterwards. It's basically small pockets of air that get trapped in your sinuses, more often than not they eventually equalise themselves as the difference in pressure pushes air through the obstruction (which is normally just mucus.)  It's advisable to end the dive if you experience any continued pain or discomfort. You should have ended this one really but I know that feeling of not wanting to ruin everyone else's dive. I don't think you have done any serious damage and you already know you should have probably come up.  I'd say don't take decongestants when diving but no one listens and everyone does. When your sinuses are like they were on this dive it's much more likely you might have more serious equalisation problems like reverse squeeze and general trouble equalising."
scuba,35ydt2,illaqueable,2,Fri May 15 22:50:43 2015 UTC,Were you congested? If you're someone who regularly gets congested then you probably need to take some sort of decongestant to allow yourself to equalize. Now I know in OW classes they tell you never to take decongestants while diving and the reason for this is if the meds wear off mid dive you'll get a reverse block. I'm not sure which medicines would work but just try to find a decongestant that works well and lasts all day so you don't have to worry about it wearing off mid dive.

scuba,35ydt2,alkali_feldspar,2,Thu May 14 18:38:02 2015 UTC,just an fyi most training agencies recommend AGAINST taking a decongestant since you can get reverse squeezes if it wears off during the dive

scuba,35v3h2,NoMoreIdols,1 point,Thu May 14 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's nasty stuff. Different lakes in NY have different ways of managing it but there's no silver bullet for getting rid of it completely. The problem is that it grows super fast, it's very big and fragile and any little piece that breaks off becomes a new plant. Some of the larger lakes like lake George have harvesting boats that cut the plants like a mower but that's only a temporary fix and actually makes things worse with all the little pieces and roots. We do whats called suction harvesting where divers pull the plants up by the roots as to get rid of the plant completely and feed it through hoses that go to a collection basket on a pontoon boat above us. Its the least environmentally intrusive and effective way to clear out milfoil but its slow and dirty work and the equipment is a pretty big initial investment. I also heard of a few of the small adk lakes having divers go swim around and forage with bags but it's insanely slow/ineffective. There's the nuclear option of using herbicides but pretty much kill all the plants in a lake, native or not. A good natural alternative I've seen too is milfoil weevils, it naturally feeds on Eurasian Milfoil and has been proven to dramatically decrease the growth of plants over years. It's important to keep milfoil from taking over a lake because unchecked it will pull all the oxygen out of the water and eventually choke out the entire natural ecosystem. As for zebra mussels, we are always looking out for them on dives but fortunately haven't seen any."

For what you're looking at you'd be mad not to try Sam at 4th element. You MUST PHONE for their best deals but they tend to be unbeatable on apeks regs.  Last year I got a full set of regs and spg for under £250. Wouldn't hesitate to use them again or reccomend them to others.

scuba,35ubmw,Uberhack,4,Wed May 13 16:01:24 2015 UTC,I have dived with people using the LavaCoreLong sleeve shirt which is fleece lined and they will not dive without it now! Expensive for a shirt though.
scuba,35ubmw,JordanJSY,1 point,Wed May 13 16:43:49 2015 UTC,Lavacore as a base layer rocks!  This weekend I was in 44 degrees (f) water wearing a DUI CF200 drysuit with a Lavacore as the undergarment.  Warm and toasty the entire dive.
scuba,35ubmw,JustJohn99,1 point,Wed May 13 17:33:28 2015 UTC,I dive a mix of wet and dry and wondered about using my Lavacore as an undergarment.  Did you use anything else or just the lavacore?

It doesn't make me a lot warmer but it's something, and mainly it makes putting a wetsuit on/off a lot easier.   If you're really worried about him getting cold, pick up a few mm vest or shortie that can go on over a wetsuit. That way if he finds he's too cold, you just pop that on and it's another layer for his core temp."
scuba,35ubmw,avboden,2,Wed May 13 17:08:53 2015 UTC,I wear a full Lycra not for the extra warmth (it provides none) but because it lets me slip my wetsuit on and off with ease.

scuba,35ubmw,Autorotator,1 point,Wed May 13 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"True, when you're between clothing and wetsuit it does kind of act as a windbreaker. And protects you from the sun.  I want to get some lycra socks; getting my feet through is the hardest part of donning/doffing."

I typically turn my wetsuit inside out up to the knees so it's easier to put my feet through and just pull it up to my waist, the socks made the need to turn it inside out almost pointless. Probably the best $3 I've spent on dive gear."
scuba,35ubmw,phorkor,1 point,Fri May 15 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"I dive with a skin underneath my half shorty. I don't notice much difference in thermodynamic properties, but I do it mainly for protection and it also makes it much easier to get into the wetsuit. Without it, I waste lots of energy trying pull wet neoprene over my bare skin while I try to get into my suit."

You can focus on the Area Marina Protetta del Plemmirio, a little south of Siracusa, there is an awesome diving that dives there http://www.capomurrodivingcenter.it/ and they have clearance to reach zone A (the one that is a complete reserve) once or twice a week. All other sites in the plemmirio peninsula are awesome and can be reached via a short walk, but if you want to stick with a diving that one is good. Another that is a bit more to the north is http://www.anemonesiracusa.com/ and they do plemmirio and the local area. I do not know for the southern and northern coasts of the Sicilia triangle since i only dived the eastern coast and the southern tip. Smile a lot, be friendly and you will usually have a good time"
scuba,35qc10,stpyang,20,Tue May 12 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is, in these locales, infrequent divers tip better when they get to see animals.  I did a trip in Indonesia recently where the dive guides were doing things similar, although not quite so egregious and when we got back to the boat, we all asked them not to do it, but for the next 3 dives, we all noticed that we started seeing all kinds of amazing critters out and available for photography.    The dive guides were positioning wildlife for us to take pictures before we even saw that they'd done it.  They know this is what drives tips.  Until our behavior changes as divers, young, often underpaid workers, will do what they feel they need to do to get big tips.  I'm not sure that this applies in this case, but I've certainly seen it in the Caribbean and South East Asia."
scuba,35qc10,ozuri,4,Tue May 12 19:50:03 2015 UTC,I just got certified last month in Belize. I didn't even really know tipping was a thing. Is it expected? Good practice? Does it depend on where you are? I saw a random guy tip $20 or something on one of our dives. He was wearing an Omega Seamaster watch so I kind of assumed he just has lots of money and tipped even if it wasn't necessarily expected.
scuba,35qc10,recluce,3,Wed May 13 07:47:36 2015 UTC,"Not expected but always welcome. I've never been tipped while working in Europe, Asia occasionally though I rarely had to buy a drink at the bar. In scapa flow I probably doubled my wage through tips. I only to if the guides do a good job, if they were harassing wildlife no tip, would report them and not drive with the centre again, if everyone did that it would stop quickly."
scuba,35qc10,scuba_platypus,1 point,Wed May 13 10:00:25 2015 UTC,"I dive and teach out of Monterey, CA. Standard tip is $10 per dive. Sometimes you get none, sometimes a lot more. But I would say 60% of the tips are there. In Mexico and large parts of the Caribbean, I expect to tip $5 per dive. I usually do live aboards in SE Asia so my tipping scheme is different there."

scuba,35qc10,Srekcalp,2,Wed May 13 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although if you'll allow me to repost the 'public statement', I can highlight several parts that bother me:  •••••••••••••••• Start of public statement ••••••••••••••••  Public Statement:  Whilst it remains SSI policy that we do not discuss specific details of Grievance Resolution Procedures with its members, due to recent events we feel it is in the public interest to state that Mark Scott and Aloha Vietnam Scuba Divers have been put into Review Status with immediate effect.  This means that neither the instructor nor the dive centre may represent themselves as Active SSI Members or register new SSI students and process SSI certifications.  If you are an SSI diver that has already participated in good faith in courses with the aforementioned instructor and dive centre, it is our sincere wish that you will not be penalised and your certification will be processed.  However, if you have not commenced your course, you are advised not to partake in any SSI training course or engage in activity under the SSI brand with this instructor or dive centre until further notice.  The instructor and dive centre have been notified.  Thank you for your understanding.  •••••••••••••••• End of public statement ••••••••••••••••  Despite making the fact this is a private statement (so far the only verification we have is emails shown to reddit mods), how are people booked to do courses with this guy to be made aware of this? In fact how can anyone confirm his credentials?"
scuba,35qc10,nl_the_shadow,4,Tue May 12 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"In fact how can anyone confirm his credentials?   SSI does everything digitally (the recently even switched to fully digital books) and allows you to search people's credentials quite easily. They have an online Dive Leader Check and an online Diver Verification. The revocation of active teaching status should show up there as a ""Non Teaching Status"". Still, I highly doubt whether new divers will actually verify whether their instructor is actually active."

scuba,35qc10,gonehawkin,3,Wed May 13 07:14:18 2015 UTC,"I guess I still don't know what you think they are doing wrong. This is no different than any of the other dive organizations with their website setup for dive center searching. I just hopped on divessi.com and indeed their no longer shown on the dive shop listing. I tried searching all known connections and it comes up blank.  SSI would not even know who had signed up for the course prior to them commencing so they would have no way to notify them as it is. The only way ANY diver would know if their shop is truly active would be to contact their respective organization. I suspect that the shop has removed all affiliations already as it is. Shooting over to divingvietnam.com shows no affiliation to SSI, and shows no real certification courses listed. Although, I can't really speak intelligently to what they had shown prior to this, I would imagine at best it did indeed show SSI."

The difference here is that this individual has displayed a long and storied pattern of disrespect for the diving community, his local environment and [from what I've heard] dive safety.  It's just that Mark Scott has been kind of a black mark on SSI for a while [again, from that I've heard].

Turtles cannot dynamically adjust their buoyancy like a fish can: they lack swim bladders, and instead calculate how much air they take into their lungs at the surface with a goal of being neutrally buoyant at the specific depth they plan to dive -- then they actually expend a ton of energy to swim downwards until their lungs compress to the point where they are neutral / at their planned depth -- somewhat like a freediving human, actually.  If you were to hop on a turtle, you can both exhaust them further by stress/panic, as well as drag them down to a depth where they are actually now negatively buoyant, where they could in theory become too tired to swim upwards/overcome the downward pull. They then drown and die.  (the more you know!)   the main idea is to just be a passing observer right?   Absolutely! Only people who are trained in the handling of an animal should even fathom touching it, and only actually do so when the scientific merit of doing it outweighs the potential harm that can come to the animal/environment as a result. There's a whole scientific code of ethics around this."

We don't know how many other incidents have been reported to SSI in the past, nor how many times previously these kinds of behaviors have gone unrecorded and unreported.   As an SSI instructor, he represents the organization.  It is in their interest at some point to disassociate with people who refuse to uphold the standards of the organization.

Even a reef just a few hundred feet from a more common site will look incredibly different. Divers are destroying reefs- and it's not with dynamite or pollution- just occasional and accidental contact. One instance isn't going to kill a reef- but when you multiply it by several divers a day for years the damage is staggering.  Obviously there are other things causing problems for the oceans- but we shouldn't be making things worse if we can help it- and we can definitely help it.

I've reported an instructor for taking his 8 year old daughter to 16m and sitting her on a table coral for a photo shoot and all they said was 'was he teaching a class?'. There's a set of Facebook photos doing the rounds of an instructor proudly showing the napoleon wrasse he shot in the face with two spears. Mass outcry and calling for PADI to recall his licence and they've done nothing. I'm not teaching any more but if I ever do get back into it I'm switching to SSI for sure.

Like the guy on the safety stops who couldn't understand why all the other divers were staring at their watches. rather than ask he would get bored each dive and leave the stop after 30 secs or so. Finally asked him why he was skipping out on the stops early every time and he was like ""huh?"" Had no idea what was going on and couldn't be bothered to ask.   THAT'S dumb.

I k ow they empty a little when you tip your pelvis certain ways (like when on a toilet for example) and with the unpredictable environment, I didn't want to chance any crazy moves I might need to do and risk any blood in my suit. Evasive maneuvers! So I use tampons. No problems at all."

scuba,35q8yj,somethingimmature,2,Tue May 12 17:10:07 2015 UTC,I'm more worried about air pockets and expansion injuries.  Maybe it's not as big a problem as I think it is.
scuba,35q8yj,baldwadc,2,Tue May 12 17:16:37 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt because I'm not a woman or a professional. But unless you magically manage to inflate yourself (ahem) down there, while at depth, I don't think there would be a way for there to be an expansion type injury. Remember expansion injuries occur because of pressurized gasses trapped in airspaces increasing in volume because of lowering external pressure as you ascend. The worst that would happen if you have an airspace behind your moon cup is that it would be forced deeper into you."
scuba,35q8yj,baldwadc,1 point,Tue May 12 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. If it's an air pocket your worried about, I wouldn't even be concerned about it! The cups don't create an air pocket or anything, they sit firmly against you. So you should be fine as far as that goes!"

Scuba board has a women's section, or contact SSI or PADI directly.  Depending on depth you are diving, air pockets can cause a lot more serious issues. Advice on the Internet is great, but you need a certified dive master or instructor. Someone may have experience that was perfectly fine diving at 15-20 feet, but may not have the same effect at 50ft etc."

scuba,35q8yj,ivyliciousme,3,Tue May 12 18:54:18 2015 UTC,I have been diving with my menstrual cup. Never even thought that it would be a problem. Never had any problems.

But if menstrual cup related diving incidents happen I would have heard about it.
scuba,35q8yj,aeslin_mouse,3,Tue May 12 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"I am a male with no personal experience with them, but I am a physicist and may be able to explain away your fear. Lets say you did put in an air space with the cup. It would be lets say a few mL of air at the surface (one atmosphere), it would then be smaller (compressed) while diving, and then return to that same size when you surface. I do not see how this could injure you. If for the sake of argument, the airspace grew through nitrogen osmosis, the seal of the cup isn't that strong; the increased volume would just push the cup out or leak the gas around and bubble out. So no injury there either. I am not a doctor, but it should be safe. Also I know a female dive instructor that uses a cup and recommends it to others. If you are still worried you can see if DAN has anything to say about them.  Also, you could think of it like the air spaces in your colon. It isn't really sealed, so any pressure will easily find its way out before it injures you."

If you buy good gear it lasts you 10 years, don't make a mistake and buy gear you don't like simply because you're inexperienced and don't understand what your preferences are.

Even at 15 days of rentals, you're still going to be spending only $600 on the high side, which is about 1/3 of what you should be spending for HIGH QUALITY gear. Don't let people tell you otherwise, if your spending less than $2,000 on gear, you will have to replace it it sooner that you would want to. Spend the money and high quality gear, it will last you a long long time.   I'm going to stick my to my opinion that as a new diver, you have NO idea what you want. Rent for a year or two. You don't even know if you will take diving on as a regular hobby yet... why waste the money?"
scuba,35pnia,FormerlyTurnipHugger,3,Wed May 13 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"you don't need to spend 2000 dollars to get quality gear that lasts. there are plenty of mid-end regs/bc's/and other equipment that give good performance. not to mention all the used gear floating around.  most shops rent pretty low end gear anyways, so purchasing your own mid-end setup will frequently mean diving with better equipment than what you would get by renting."
scuba,35pnia,GhotiStyx,2,Wed May 13 21:56:24 2015 UTC,"Did you check the stickie on dive gear? Most newbie questions on gear have been asked and answered, and you can find those answers there.  To answer your question on lift: this is essentially the capacity of the BCDs air bladder. The more air you can put in your BCD, the more buoyant it will get, thus providing more lift (=upwards force). For standard BCDs, you cannot usually choose the capacity, and it's not necessary to choose a particularly high-lift BCD unless you want to do some serious tech diving.  It's perfectly fine to buy a used BCD. First, you should find one that fits your size really well. Then you should check that the air bladder is intact (i.e. inflate it and make sure it doesn't leak), that the dump valves are clean and functional, that the inflator works, that the inside isn't too mouldy or otherwise dirty, and that the straps and buckles are all in good condition. Then have a look if the pockets are easily accessible and a good size for your needs. Same with D-rings, are they well positioned?"

scuba,35pnia,GhotiStyx,1 point,Tue May 12 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm chiming in with others here: it might be in your best interest to hold off buying gear (unless you have a specific reason), and give yourself the opportunity to rent equipment a few times so you can get a sense of what you like and don't like. (e.g. some people like vest inflation, some people like back inflation because it helps keep them horizontal in the water) - things you wouldn't really know about unless you've tried them out first.    Lift isn't something that I've ever been concerned with: unless you're carrying mad equipment to unsual depths, any decent BC will have enough air capacity to bring you to the surface.  As a matter of fact, if you overfill, you can runaway ascend (and I'm sure you know that's a bad thing.  You certainly don't want to get bent).  The more important questions are: how does it feel/fit?  If you have an uncomfortable BC, you'll be irritated by it constantly.  It should be nearly invisible to you.  Does it have a really good adjustment system to change with conditions (or your body).  How ergonomic is the layout?  are things where you would naturally expect them to be, so you don't have to fumble around?   I personally like a vest inflator with an in-line integrated octo: it minimizes my profile so I'm slim in the water and nothing dangles.  My best friend/diving buddy likes a back inflated dualie capable rig that I would find way too much for reef diving: it just a matter of personal taste.  I'm a total gearhead, so I had a hard time resisting getting my gear at first too: but in many cases if you're traveling to dive, the baggage fees will cancel out the gear rental: just bring your fins mask and suit, and give yourself some time to figure out what works for you!"

Will if matter if I got a bcd that fits but the specifications states that  it's for a lighter weight range than my weight?"
scuba,35pnia,runsongas,1 point,Tue May 12 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"if it moves around too much, you can try sewing a crotch strap onto the jacket. you might want to look at buying online if selection is that limited, most of the online scuba retailers will ship international. dive gear express will ship orders over 250 or 300 for free usually too."
scuba,35pnia,runsongas,1 point,Tue May 12 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"Not at all unless you plan on some serious tec/rec diving.  I think the weight range is more for sizing.  They even make very small, lightweight BCD's that are meant to pack tiny for travel, and they tend to be well rated by average sized guys.  Think of it this way: if you need any weights at all, you're beginning the dive positively boyant at your heaviest (full tanks).  The amount of lift you'll need will get smaller if you drop some weights: so unless you'll be carrying significant negatively boyuant equipment, it's really not an issue.  Scubapro is a good brand, and I know they make a back inflating model (almost bought it).  Let me ask: what kind of diving do you do (and anticipate doing), and are your dives local or will you need to travel?"

Diving in a moderately popular recreational lake doesn't yield much of anything. ""Ohh, a trash bottle of champagne!"" ""How'd an engine block get down here?"" ""Yup, another lost boat anchor.""  Then again, I'm glad that I learned to dive in quarries. While they didn't prepare me for surf, surge, or current, they have forced me to be much better at navigation, cold water, and low vis conditions."

Or you can dive the same spot 20 times and come across something that has been there for 50 years, but you haven't discovered until now. I've found so many old bottles and ""artifacts"" from the steam engine days that simply make diving up here more interesting than places with 200 feet of vis. Cold water divers are a special breed."

scuba,35o6d9,sharkiteuthis,2,Tue May 12 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"Adopt an ""every dive is a skills dive"" attitude and suddenly these dives go from being 'meh' to being goal-oriented.  Personally, I'm psyched to spend a whole day doing skills dives in 41F water. I get more familiar with my gear, work on trim, practice kicks and valve drills, get more comfortable with being able to know my gauge pressure to +/-150psi without looking, and all of the other thousand things I need to not have to think about when I start working up top penetrating wrecks at 100m+.  I also just love the water. I'd sit in one spot and play the ""don't touch the platform for 30 minutes"" game if it didn't bore most of my dive buddies to tears."

On my ""Deep Dive"" for AOW we dropped down to the platform at 62ft and it was pitch black were it not for our lights. I had wondered about how people could ever end up deeper than they thought they were at. Then I went to Bonaire and found out that I could see for 100ft.  This dive was actually more of a gear checkout guide. We're taking advantage of being Northeast divers to do the ""every dive is a skills dive"" thing. We're headed to Galapagos later this summer and, even though we're around 120 dives, we're going on some less desirable dives around here to practice things like currents, surge, etc. That way when we encounter these things at Darwin it will be a little closer to second nature."

scuba,35lspi,arhoglen,10,Tue May 12 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"My first exposure to scuba was through a ""discover diving"" thing in Mexico. 3-4 hours of classes, followed by what was supposed to be an afternoon pool dive, and they would take you to a shallow reef for two ~30ft dives the next day. I was the only one signed up though, so I got 1 hour of classroom and then BAM! here's the ocean. It was terrifying, but it did motivate me to get the certifications because I knew what was out there waiting for me beyond the pool.  As far as picking up sea life, I can't think of ANY of that happening, and I think it is a HORRIBLE example to inexperienced divers.   (I have seen dive masters in areas with destroyed reefs pick up dead coral and carry it to an area of live coral so that it will be a safer environment for fish and stuff, as opposed to just being destroyed by the current. I feel like that is not so bad, because it was the dive masters in the area doing everything they knew they could to get the reef to come back after a hurricane.)"
scuba,35lspi,Grepus,2,Mon May 11 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard similar stories, most of them, unfortunately, seem to come from holiday resorts in Mexico. Most recently, two people I went diving with in Maldives in December last year had got certified (AOWD!!!) in the summer in Mexico.   They had no idea about buoyancy control, they would bounce along the bottom, kicking up sand, silt and bits of coral they were breaking with their fins. The dive guide would tell them to put some air in the jackets, they'd overdo it and start heading towards the surface like a rocket, etc. In the next dive of the two we were doing, the girl of the couple didn't deflate her jacket so couldn't descend. This was on a drift dive so we had to abort the dive as we lost her.  Once back on the boat, the dive guide actually wanted to know the exact centre they got certified at as they were obviously just given their cards without having done any of the training."
scuba,35lspi,arhoglen,1 point,Tue May 12 08:20:31 2015 UTC,"This was definitely not a ""certification"" by any means, just an opportunity to try it out. In hindsight, it was more danger than it was worth, and my PADI certified husband should have seen that. However, he tends to be a bit more reckless as a diver than I am and he just got excited at the chance to dive together. I probably would never have pursued diving if it wasn't for that adventure."

scuba,35lspi,drinkermoth,5,Wed May 13 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"I learnt to dive in Cairns and this happens. I was doing my certification there but I'm sure some companies take out unqualified divers, possible beyond what is advisable. They certainly intefer with the environment, touch, pick up and move things. They were quite serious about protecting the coral still fairly lax.   There are certainly issues of safetly here in that the instructors may be diving too often, and possibly ascending too quickly as they look after students. However that's their choice. I think mostly they are ok but I have no experience of working in that environment.   I think what your worrying about is the environmental impact though. I think there is somethingg to be concerned about, in that this kind of behaviour normalises the idea that nature is somthing that you can go up and touch without consequence. This is not a safe attitude and it is one we should try to avoid with regards to minimising stress on marine species.   However many of the companies would argue that by allowing people to interact with the environment they begin to understand why these environments should be conserved. Furthermore the grounps do try and minimise the impact to a small number of reefs. I don't know how successful they are at that but they make some effort.   I think that these groups are probably doing more harm than good but I havn't read any papers on the topic."

There were about 3-4 people per instructor, you had to stay within 10 feet of them and also they instructed us to never touch the wildlife. I'm not sure if it was completely legal, but it was an awesome first scuba experience.

It went down to around 40 ft, thinking back now it was not a great decision because of the potential danger but I had wanted to dive the Great Barrier Reef my whole life. I also forgot to say even though it barely helps, they did give a 20 minute session on the absolute bare essentials of safety and what to do. I am now taking an actual certification course though.   It surprises me that these companies have not gotten in trouble because it seems like with so many people diving with no experience someone would be bound to get hurt or worse..."
scuba,35lspi,randomredd,1 point,Tue May 12 05:32:30 2015 UTC,"I did my first, and only so far, dive in Mexico with absolutely no experience. It was very similar to r/weboctopus's dive.  It was four of us and one instructor and we did one 30 min class then a pool session. Shockingly two of the four people going were under ten years old. We did two dives, one was about 40ft and the other around 70ft. I honestly didn't know that this wasn't completely common practice. I felt pretty comfortable as our instructor seemed incredibly knowledgeable. He was very serious about educating us (especially the children) on absolutely not touching anything while we were down. I specifically remember him talking about how one misplaced kick could me destroying years of reef growth.  It was pretty amazing and I was shocked at the time that the process was so easy. I thought any sort of scuba diving takes hours and hours of training...apparently this may still be the case judging by the comments I'm reading here. However, it did inspire me to get certified. If I didn't have such a hard time equalizing on the way down and up I would absolutely already have it, I'm a bit scared off because of the trouble I had the first time."
scuba,35lspi,HexHoodoo,1 point,Wed May 13 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you had a good experience.  However, as a PADI certified divemaster, I've seen people freak out over pretty common aspects of diving - mask clearing, etc. - and bolt for the surface.  Even 30 or so feet of uncontrolled ascent can lead to injury, particularly if you forget - or are not told - to always expel air when ascending.  More info: http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medical/faq/Mechanism_of_Injury_for_Pulmonary_Over-Inflation_Syndrome  IMO there's a reason you do things over and over and over in the pool - so it becomes comfortable to you and you can 'deal' if something unexpected happens under water."
scuba,35lspi,lackin,1 point,Thu May 14 08:55:57 2015 UTC,"This is a more usual experience.  The code of practice here states a maximum 4 to 1 ratio for these ""discover"" dives. The coroner wanted to reduce that to 2 to 1, but that recommendation was rejected in favour of doing a risk assessment and reducing the ratio if conditions suggest it. So yes, the tourism industry is more worried about profit than safety to the point of rejecting the recommendations of the coroner - take from that what you will.  Of course, the story from the OP is exactly why when asked about where to go in the GBR we always say to go on the expensive live-aboards to the outer reef, because the places these tourist boats go are completely destroyed. The only good news is that they keep all the tourists in the same (already destroyed) spots, so the rest of the reef isn't effected quite as badly (by this type of thing, anyway).

My DM friend kept and eye on us, the instructor was the one showing us everything.  We went out in groups, more more than 3 or four to an instructor. Our Instructor just had me and my BF.  I felt very safe, even though I panicked a little due to mask flooding. They explained to us on the way out there what we would be doing, the signals, how to equalize etc. They explained very thoroughly not to touch anything and that after this was done we were not certified! Only went to about ten meters. INSTANTLY HOOKED.   Queensland is very strict about it's recreational diving, have to have your SMB, knife, whistle and snorkel with you at all times.

There must have been 10+ of us per professional. They would lure over fish and turtles with food to get a good picture and pick anything and everything up.  The only thing I can say is that they took us to part of the reef that was already fucked. I saw tourists break off pieces of coral to take home, stand all over the reef that kind of thing. At the very least they're only doing it to already dead reef and not doing it to anything still alive.  I can't remember the company but it was a trip out to Michaelmas Cay."
scuba,35lspi,Punicagranatum,10,Mon May 11 17:13:48 2015 UTC,But even dead reef has enormous ecological value because it is far easier to restore dead reef than grow a new reef from scratch. That sounds awful.

There's definitely some shoddy operators, but for the most part no one dies.  The GBR is definitely getting destroyed, but the high impact does not come from divers. Invasives / noxious species like the Crown of Thorns do more damage to the reef, as well as other threats like climate change (bleaching), ships not looking where they're going, government dredging inititives, etc.  Its sadly ironic that the sites dived the most heavily on the GBR are the sites that are generally the most well cared for (the dive shops put in a lot of 'after hours' work to clean up noxious animals, put right any coral that was damaged during the day, etc). Keep the sites nice, the tourists keep coming, the money keeps coming in, means the sites keep getting cared for."
scuba,35lspi,CanadianDiver,1 point,Tue May 12 07:38:59 2015 UTC,It is tough to blame the certifying agency. Every agency has both good and bad examples of their representatives. The only thing you can do is take pictures and forward a complaint. Most agencies do take this seriously and don't want their reputation to be tarnished because of a few bad apples.
scuba,35lspi,GiantPragmaticPanda,2,Tue May 12 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say this surprise me, sadly it does not. however you are very correct. as a marine toxicologist specializing in reef preservation, and a certified scuba instructor (NOT PADI) the behavior and general lack of respect for the reefs all over the world that I have seen and grown to expect from PADI instructors and Dive masters alike, sickens me.  This is just a personal opinion that I have arrived at from years of having to deal with the figurative sport diving Giant PADI. but in my opinion PADI is a world wide plague on the industry. they have the market share in almost every major sport diving location. and use restrictive contracts to keep all other more comprehensive and educational based certification company's out of the field. PADI cares about one thing and one thing only. Put as many divers in the water as they can, to put as many dollars as they can in the bank. If you want the most unsafe, most expensive and least educational dive certification then PADI is the cert org for you. if you love diving, marine environments, and don't want to die use any of the other cert organizations."
scuba,35lspi,murkleton,2,Mon May 11 20:17:25 2015 UTC,"I'm currently going through the instructor development course and most of it s based on role model behaviour and becoming a quality teacher. The materials are good, some is based on selling but I want to sell courses. I'm a great diver with a great outlook, I've trained all the way with PADI and I want to share what I've learned. As a five star centre, complete with scientists and doctors on the dive team we drill into students the need to look after your environment.  Yes, they have a monopoly on the training sector and I do feel agencies like SSI and NAUI are not getting their fair share of the market despite being quality training bodies. I do think it is a tall order trying to police training violations around the globe and there are some horrific practices going on. PADI is by no means perfect and I have more than my fair share of problems regarding their business model but PADI didn't teach people to do these things. People just have a habit of being dicks.  Really I think it boils down to choosing the right teachers displaying the right behaviour. Ultimately the owners of the business have a massive obligation to ensure training standards are met. The diving community as a whole regardless of where their instructor qualifications lie need to take responsibility in and out of the water.  I do think you're being a little bit ridiculous. PADI does it's best but ultimately if you don't have respect for the life in your backyard your just being a bit of a dick."
scuba,35lspi,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-5,Mon May 11 20:54:37 2015 UTC,"Hm. It's very unlikely that there were 60 divers in any given day-trip group on the GBR. Normally, a day boat is 90% snorkelers and a handful divers, up to a dozen maybe.  Overall, there are far more than 60-70 people going to the reefs, there are many day trip boats and they take hundreds of people out there every day. That's obviously not that great for the reef, which is why I wouldn't recommend to anyone to go on a day trip there.  However, one needs to take into account the sheer size of the Great Barrier Reef. We're talking about 2900 reefs stretched out over 340,000 km2 . The little bit of damage that's being done to the two or three reef groups that are serviced daily from Cairns plays a negligible role in the bigger picture.  The very existence of this tourist industry is in fact what keeps the reef alive. Without it, and the money it generates, the government would be far more inclined to dredge channels through the reef to allow for more coal exports and such."

scuba,35myym,Uberhack,4,Mon May 11 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Shaw's cove is very beginner friendly because it seems like conditions are always slightly better there, and the swimthrough arch is always fun to do. Check out other sites here and check conditions at laguna sea sports. If conditions are really good I'd do Woods Cove.  Take a dive boat from Long Beach to day trip over to Catalina if you want fantastic viz, it's anywhere between 30-100+ feet.  San Diego has the shores, Marine Room and Cove and all of them are great and bring something different to the table. Personally I love the Cove because of the seven-gill sharks and occasional giant sea bass.  Make sure you shuffle your feet as you go in from the beach, my buddy got hit by a ray recently in just 2 feet of water near the Shores and had to sit out from all the dives. Went right through the boot and 7mil wetsuit."
scuba,35myym,bowshikabowow,2,Mon May 11 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"The visibility is really that good in Catalina? I'm going to have to try it out, I have always avoided California waters because of low visibility."
scuba,35myym,its_penguin_related,2,Mon May 11 23:59:19 2015 UTC,"The absolute worst was about 25 feet of viz and the best I saw was 100ish. On average I'd say it's about 40ft. Absolutely go diving there, on a decent day you'll notice the water turns turquoise at Catalina and you can see bright orange Garibaldi swimming along the reef from the boat.  It's that clear."

scuba,35myym,addicteddiver,2,Thu May 14 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the update. I just remember walking all the way back to the car on Cleo street because I had no snorkel."
scuba,35myym,ChuQWallA,2,Thu May 14 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"I also recommend Shaw's Cove, with a word of caution though. There are some swim-thru's and crevices at Shaw's Cove that are very shallow(they let out at around 45 if I remember correctly). Since you and your son are both very inexperienced I highly highly highly recommend you two don't go and explore those much further past the arch. Especially if there's any surge at all because those crevices become a toilet bowl in even low surge situations.  Besides that though it's a great beginner friendly site that is one of my favorites in all CA! Have fun!"
scuba,35myym,freechipsandguac,1 point,Mon May 11 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The arch should be clear, not dark and watch the fish or particulates in the area for surge. If the fish are just at a standstill idly swimming by in the arch and beyond, go for it but only if you're comfortable and can deal with somewhat narrow trenches and usually moderate surge. Also make sure you know how to get back and take your compass bearings, it can be a little confusing (especially at night)."
scuba,35myym,bowshikabowow,1 point,Tue May 12 01:03:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are saying it is OK for two newbs to hit up a shore dive at Shaw's. My buddy and I will be certified this weekend (capped off with 3 dives @ the Channel Islands).    At what point can my newly certified buddy and I shore dive by ourselves (at easy sites from SD up to Santa Barbara or even Monterrey).    Do people just say 'go for it' if you are comfortable, or should we first go with divers experienced at that beach, or even get X# of dives in before we go alone?"
scuba,35myym,kingsnwings,1 point,Tue May 12 04:00:41 2015 UTC,"You are a certified diver. That means, your instructors should have given you the skills necessary to dive without a babysitter. However you are absolutely right, ultimately you should never dive beyond your comfort level, and you shouldn't be comfortable diving much further than your training level. That said, go for it! Just plan, be safe, and remember your training! If you aren't comfortable going without a guide or dive master, then hire one for the day!"
scuba,35myym,apostle228,1 point,Tue May 12 13:40:57 2015 UTC,"Apostle is right. You're a certified diver and so is your buddy.   I would caution against the ""go for it"" attitude though. Even if you are comfortable. Always research a site before you dive it and ask around about it at dive shops or with other dives. For example, if you were coming up to Monterey for the first time and wanted to dive Monastery Beach, I would recommend either going to a different, less dangerous site or probably offer to join you so you get to dive the site and have someone in your group who knows around the site and is experienced with its dangers.   Worst come to worst, you can always go on a day trip on a boat or get a tour with a DM. Yeah it costs money but you're going with people who are locals in addition to knowing the area(including what sites work best with what conditions), they may also have knowledge of stuff like where certain animals prefer."
scuba,35myym,freechipsandguac,1 point,Tue May 12 20:20:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I am definitely going to research any shore dive before I go. I just didn't want to do something that would be generally frowned upon for being unsafe.
scuba,35myym,kingsnwings,2,Wed May 13 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"If he wants to be a marine biologist you absolutely MUST go to crystal cove during low tide. It's just north of Laguna and just south of Corona Del Mar(newport beach).  The pools are textbook, urchin, anemone, crabs, shell fish, the list goes on and on."
scuba,35myym,quizbuk,2,Tue May 12 01:28:13 2015 UTC,La Jolla Cove and La Jolla Shores are typically very doable in June/July in SD.    SDExpeditions and La Jolla Dive both run guided dives to both those sites.
scuba,35myym,Super_Natant,2,Tue May 12 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll bite. I absolutely don't recommend you diving Shaw's Cove. If you're looking for a good experience get on any one of the boats out of San Diego or take one of the boats from San Pedro or Long Beach to Catalina Island. Why don't I recommend Shaw's? First off, there's about 65 stairs down and 65 back up. You're going to work a lot harder to go diving than if you just took a boat. Once you get in the water at Shaw's average viz for that site is 7-15ft. Also your dive is very dependent on the surf report. I've seen divers get tossed there in 5ft waves. Also have had friends drive there only to have life guards close the beaches to divers. If by chance you do get in and the viz is decent it certainly is a pretty dive and is one of my favorites. However, during June/July boats fill up very quickly. You need to book them at least a week in advance so you can't wait on a surf report for Shaw's. Just go get a boat for $140 and do 3 awesome dives with food included."
scuba,35myym,reddit_ur_wrong,1 point,Tue May 12 09:01:26 2015 UTC,In San Diego La Jolla coves is a good place to go diving. There's lots of sea grass and kelp beds there. There are also sea lions too and sharks sometimes.

It is a surf entry that was easy when I went, but could be challenging depending on waves.  The stairs down & up to the beach kicked my tank & weight carrying butt. Catalina has unbelievable viz, I could sit at 50' and stare up at the kelp ""trees"" all day (or until low air)."

scuba,35n3a2,Tpaloki,3,Tue May 12 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"When we opened in 2005, we had 4 whale sharks - Ralph, Norton, Alice, and Trixie. Unfortunately the first two did pass away in 2007. Their replacements, Taroko and Yushan, joined the others and have been living with us since then, so just shy of a decade."
scuba,35n3a2,Mr_Leppak,0,Tue May 12 11:55:14 2015 UTC,Every few years the whalesharks die and are quietly replaced.  I think the record for survival is 4 years.
scuba,35n3a2,eanx100,2,Tue May 12 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"Are they using them for research, or just for an attraction?  I would have to boycott any aquarium that used them for just an attraction, if they only live for 4 years...just like I refuse to go to Sea World, because of the Killer Whales."
scuba,35n3a2,Tpaloki,2,Tue May 12 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yes! Research is conducted, not much is known about the whale sharks, and being the only aquarium outside of Asia to have them, they keep close tabs on the 4 of them. Trust me when I say that they baby those animals like you would a dog. :)"
scuba,35n3a2,Mr_Leppak,2,Tue May 12 12:00:43 2015 UTC,"There is some research done, but the value of research done on an animal in a habitat that is way too small for it is of questionable value.  In the wild, whalesharks feed vertically and horizontally.  In the aquarium it is impossible for the whalesharks to feed vertically because the tank is only 25 ft deep.   They have to specially train them to eat in swimlanes following a small boat.  As far as I can tell, the aquarium is not legally a non-profit.  It's cool to go see whalesharks, but don't mistake the aquarium for an eco-friendly scientific org.   They're in it for the monies.   The science is a distant 2nd or 3rd focus."
scuba,35n3a2,eanx100,3,Tue May 12 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"While you are inarguably correct in saying that ""thorough"" research cannot be done on the 4 fish at the aquarium, there certainly is information being constantly gathered and would be used in conjunction with the research gathered in field stations.   I think its important to also point out, that while whale sharks do employ vertical feeding in the wild, it isn't the only means and is used based on how the food is presented in the situation.  Since there is no need to feed vertically, they employ a more active, sucking filtration.  Annndddd not to nitpick, but the habitat is 30ft at its deep side. ;)"

scuba,35oa8u,murkleton,1 point,Tue May 12 05:32:48 2015 UTC,"If you are active with a dive shop, they will frequently provide discounts for their DM's/Instructors.   Additionally, different manufacturers provide ""key-man"" deals through the dive shops to provide a good discount to the instructors/DM's at the shops in order to get them in the gear to show off to the students. In my experience, key-man deals vary in terms of the size of the discount and frequently require the dive shop to order the key-man deal specially without taking it out of the shop's normal inventory. Key-man deals may be for a single item, but more frequently apply to an entire package of gear (e.g. buy wetsuit + reg + bcd == huge discount). Key-man deals also require you to be active with the dive shop."
scuba,35nab5,skipper14,5,Mon May 11 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Holy shit mate... you're breaking a lot of rules there. Get to a doctors, you might have done some damage - that 'water in your ear' for a week does not sound good. At the very least you're bruising your middle ear. Speak to an instructor or seasoned diver about equalisation techniques.  If you can't equalise properly stay at a depth where you feel no pain and no more than light pressure. Stop really forcing it - that's how you rupture the round window in your inner ear and then there's no more diving ever and possibly no more hearing. You may even be at a depth where your eustachian tube is too compressed to equalise the air space - equalise often and early with a nice and slow controlled descent.  The pain on the way back up is called a reverse squeeze where the expanding air in your middle ear cannot escape - if this happens halt ascending until it's rectified or as long as your NDL/gas supply allows. Ultimately you may have to surface and do some damage. Could also be due to your decongestants wearing off, could be due to bruising or could be due to the same reasons you can't equalise in the first place.   Everyone's sinuses are different, some find it easy, some find it hard. I've had some success using decongestants the night before in combination with a saline nasal douche. It's not pleasant but it'll really help clear any crap out.  Either way I think your ears deserve a rest from the punishment you've been giving them!! Don't be afraid to call a dive. Anyone can call a dive at any time. Ever."
scuba,35nab5,murkleton,1 point,Mon May 11 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed! You should never ever force your way down! Very real chance of rupturing ear drums and losing ability to dive or even hearing. Never be too proud to abort a dive!   Also, don't seek medical advice from the Internet! DAN has medical specialists standing by right this moment that you can speak to free of charge. Call them.   In regards to helping your ears in the future, I find it helps to practice clearing my ears often leading up to trips. I use several methods including the classic nose-pinch-and-blow, nose-pinch-and-hard-swallow, nose-pinch-extend-lower-jaw-and-swallow, etc. I also find the turning the affected ear upward (away from the shoulder) also helps to sometimes clear a stubborn ear.   DEFINITELY don't dive if your ears won't cooperate though. That pain is your body's way of telling you not to do that, and it would be wise to listen."
scuba,35nab5,RunningWhale,1 point,Tue May 12 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"I know this is a late reply but I thought you should know that that fullness you feel for days after is whatever your body can provide to fill the vacuum. Usually blood.  Do not force it!  I know it's not the ""right way"" but what works for me is to pre- equalize before you put your face in the water."
scuba,35nab5,tokyosuits,2,Wed May 13 05:01:13 2015 UTC,You need to get to an Ear Nose and Throat Specialist who knows diving. It sounds like you never learned to clear properly and are doing damage to your ears.
scuba,35md5w,RTchoke,2,Mon May 11 18:11:54 2015 UTC,I think most of us will say that with good vis and warm waters it's always worth it. Never been to Costa del Sol personally but I cherish any time I get to dive. Just my two cents.
scuba,35md5w,prosnoozer,2,Mon May 11 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, I live on the Costa del Sol and have only recently started diving since the weather got better here this year (I completed my OWD and AOWD at the end of last year and have been waiting for the better weather).  I have been researching quite a few places and I'm starting to build a list of where's good and where to avoid. Unfortunately, this is all in my head at the moment! Where are you going to be staying/travelling through and I'll see what I can dig up for you.  Edit, to answer your questions:   Yes, you can get days of excellent vis depending on the weather and there can be plenty to see, all depends on location, which is why I've asked where you'll be. Like I said, I'm building a list, but I've found some pretty good, reputable and inexpensive places recently. For example, in Tarifa where the Met meets the Atlantic, there's a great dive center called YellowSub (http://www.divingtarifa.com/) which are 5* PADI recommended, they were 45€ (50USD) for a single dive with all kit hire. They have packages where this obviously gets cheaper still. Off the coast of Gibraltar you have a recently sunk tug boat which is proving popular, but the one main dive center in Gibraltar is very expensive (£63 for a single dive with kit hire which is about 99USD) - there are also WWII and other military wrecks, including a Bristol Bomber at 35m (more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shipwrecks_of_Gibraltar) Freediving is not something I've got into yet, but I can ask as I'm diving on Sunday   Any other questions about the area, let me know. And if you're staying nearby me, happy to buy you a beer or maybe even come along for a dive with you if you need a buddy  All the best"

scuba,35lps8,Grepus,3,Mon May 11 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Let me start with the standard disclaimer to contact DAN for dive medical questions.  That said...  I get routinely seasick while diving, especially if it's murky and turbulent.  No boat required, I get seasick on shore dives.  More degrees of freedom of motion, less of a reference from gravity, often poor viz (at least where I am).  My equilibrium can't take it.  Bonine is my savior, I take one or two any morning I'm diving, and no more chumming.    I know that's standard meds, but it has definitely worked for me.  Gritting it out through the end of dive feeling the puke coming on is no fun."
scuba,35lps8,livininsnee,1 point,Mon May 11 15:46:55 2015 UTC,I think this is what happened to me... most dives I've been on have been pretty good vis-wise and not turbulent at all. Vis was poor and the washing machine effect probably took me over the edge.   Bonine seems to be a branded version of meclizine... I will see what the local equivalent name is. Thanks for your input :)
scuba,35lps8,oh_brothers,1 point,Mon May 11 15:55:32 2015 UTC,I get this a bit as well. Seems to be especially common if I've had lots of sugar (including fruit) or been near the motor gasses.
scuba,35lps8,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,2,Mon May 11 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"Can't say I've ever experienced that, but maybe a Dramamine before the trip? The non-drowsy kind would probably be better."
scuba,35lps8,MyWorkThrowawayShhhh,1 point,Mon May 11 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"I reckon any meds you're going to take pre-dive should be non-drowsy! haha! I've not heard of dramamine, I'll speak to my local pharmacist and ask about it and the other meds that have been recommended so far.  Thanks!"
scuba,35lps8,drlucky66,2,Mon May 11 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Dramamine is the sea-sickness pill. It's also recommended for those who get motion sickness. As I understand it, it is very low side effect. I've never had to take it, however, so talking with a pharmacist is a good idea."
scuba,35lps8,pathdaft,2,Mon May 11 16:00:34 2015 UTC,Dramamine can cause drowsiness. I do not get sea sick myself but most people that I dive with that do use Bonine instead as it does not cause drowsiness. It seems to work for most all the people I dive with. Some people I see on the boats use the patch that goes behind your ear (not sure what it is called) If bonine does not work for you talk to your doctor about getting the patch (it is by prescription only).
scuba,35lps8,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,1 point,Mon May 11 21:18:29 2015 UTC,You can also take meclizine. Similar stuff. Ginger candy is also helpful to prevent the nausea.
scuba,35lps8,alaskanpolyglot,2,Mon May 11 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"we had a weird turbulence which would sway you towards the wall and then away again.   I suspect this what caused your ""mal de mere"".   We followed the buoy chain and got up to 5 metres and held onto it there for the 3 minutes   I don't recommend holding onto the ascend line in the future. You don't want to get yanked up and down the water column by the line when doing safety stop. You risk barotrauma even in that depth. What you can do is maintain a light grip/hold to prevent getting swept away by any lateral current.  EDIT: I also avoid acidic food and beverage. No coffee or OJ for breakfast for me.  About the sea sickness, I used to take dramamine early in my diving career. One before bedtime the night before and one about one hour before the first dive. I also find ginger shavings in my hot tea (brought in a thermos) to be soothing to my stomach."

The only reason we were holding onto the line was to stop us being dragged away the current, but I probably didn't need to hold onto it constantly and should have just controlled my buoyancy and kicked to keep near to the line.   Thanks for your advice, this sub has been full of great ideas."
scuba,35lps8,Voicy,1 point,Tue May 12 08:11:08 2015 UTC,You can buy what's called a jon line for that. It's a piece of rope with a hook at the end that you attach to the ascend line. Google it.
scuba,35lps8,Voicy,2,Tue May 12 09:33:55 2015 UTC,"Seasickness. I suspect I could get seasick looking at a picture of a ship in a bottle on the internet on a bad day.  Well done. You handled it well. You were thinking about what to do. You can actually be sick through a reg (I've done it) and through the loop of a rebreather (I've seen it but I couldn't work out what he was signalling but we were on mandatory stops). If you think you are getting near being seasick keep your eyes shut as much as possible (works on a line but no chance on a free ascent). If you are going to be sick have your octo in your hand ready because it tastes so much nicer and lets you wash out the primary in case there is going to be a sequel.  Actually the best lesson I learnt is that being seasick is no big deal compared to feeling seasick. Heave your breakfast over the side, grab a nice bottle of clean water, wash your mouth out with the first mouthful, over the side with that one, then drink a hearty draft to replace all that fluid you just ditched, kit up and dive because you get several minutes feeling quite good and, provided you keep out of the swell, it won't come back.  I either deliberately stand up not holding on to anything and watch the horizon or curl up with my eyes shut if it's going to be a rough ride out. Head down fiddling with kit or reading something and you will reprise breakfast."

scuba,35lps8,murkleton,1 point,Tue May 12 08:12:00 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I have THE best serviced reg in the world, because I've gotten sick through my reg so many times.   Mostly during safety stops when there is big surge and you end up rising and falling without noticing it. I've also been sick from a boat ride and chundered right through my reg as I descended.   i'm one of those who get sick very easily but my recovery time is a few minutes then I'm golden. I even get seasick while floating on the surface waiting for the boat pickup...so now i just stay down longer than the rest and get up when most others have already gotten onto the boat. I generally have about 30-40bar more in my cylinder than others after a dive."

scuba,35lps8,Super_Natant,2,Mon May 11 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"Nah it's not that bad hey...purge the reg and wash it out and its sorted...its also the reason i will NEVER dive with rental regs, because I know what goes through them.   It's also why checking your gear is so important predive, you dont know whats in there or what could get stuck.

Interesting on the dual AL100s, are the buoyancy characteristics going from full to 1/3rd empty (negative to positive) a little annoying or are you just really used to it by now that it's basically second nature? Also do you shift the bottom bolt snap to a different D-ring at around 1800psi/137bar, or do you use the slider adjuster? Thank you for taking the time to answer questions!"

scuba,35j3ey,SevenTreeIsle,2,Mon May 11 08:08:13 2015 UTC,"I had only the sliding D-rings, no fixed. The ones we used were the http://www.santiagodivingmexico.com/lb-sr-en They are good, but not perfect, and you can slide them to your liking, when the Alu starts to rise. I also used these, and they are not too bad either. http://www.deepstop.de/883-thickbox_default/sliding-d-ring.jpg I think it also depends a little bit on how thick/stiff the webbing is, if it's not stiff enough, the sliding D-Rings can slide a little by themselves, but this is not a big deal. When it feels off, and you can't feel the cylinder sometimes bouncing on your thigh, then you adjust them. Steve had a prototype of a new Apeks harness with a completely different style of sliding d-rings that was tightened by a Bungee, they really looked nice, but I never got the chance to test them myself."
scuba,35j3ey,smithincanton,2,Mon May 11 08:23:45 2015 UTC,I've been playing around with both the fixed and the slider right now and getting feedback from other sidemounters really helps. Bungee tightened d-rings? Interesting...

scuba,35l6ai,utopiah,2,Mon May 11 12:06:15 2015 UTC,"Komodo has amazing diving, but some seriously strong currents at many of the dive sites. Best place I have ever been diving though (live aboard). Komodo dragons are with the trip alone.. As others mentioned, good diving in Bali and on nusa lembongan / penida - mantas & mola mola if you're lucky!"
scuba,35l6ai,Y-mir,2,Mon May 11 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"I've got a few hundred dives, around Australia, GBR, Raja Ampat, Bahamas, Greece.   The best dive (flora and fauna) I've ever done was Quinn's Rocks, just off Byron bay, NSA, Australia. So much action, in such a small place. Some of the greybeards diving there said they have dived it several hundred times, and always see new stuff, and I can believe it.  I spent a few weeks in Raja Ampat on a live aboard. It was certainly good, but not ""amazing"", and not going to ""ruin"" you.  It's a great idea to do your advanced OW on a live-aboard, IMO, as you'll be doing so many dives, you can really solidify the knowledge. Check with the tour operator, though, if they take divers without an OW cert - they may not?  I've never dived in the other places you listed, so I cannot comment, but I reckon you should consider your partner - snorkelling is fun and just as good as diving IMO, just different."
scuba,35l6ai,garionhall,2,Mon May 11 12:30:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks so I'll most likely stick to Bali/Gilis/Lombok then.  I thought I would do the Advanced OW here at home but ... maybe I should consider doing it in Indonesia in fact. I didn't even consider it but I'll see I want to avoid logistic headaches when we are just there to ""enjoy"".  Regarding snorkelling do you think we should take a course just for that or it's not really worth it?  You didn't mention the Nitrox specialization but only Advanced AO so what's your take on it, totally optinonal? I was wondering since an instructor told me most exotic locations do insist on diving to make repetitive dives less exhausting."
scuba,35l6ai,garionhall,2,Mon May 11 12:38:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't have my Nitrox cert, but you're right, it is often recommended. I guess I cannot comment on the value of it, though I seem to remember reading it's not a HUGE difference - I am sure other divers here can comment on that better than me.   When doing advanced open water, or the nitrox cert, there are not really any logistical headaches, in fact, I think it's better to do certs (especially the multi-dive ones) on a live-aboard (or at least in a town in one week - and it may as well be Indo with nice weather!), so you can focus on specific acheivements and attain them within a few days. There's plenty of time for study in dive intervals, and you can put what you learn into practise immeadiately. And, of course, you get to do dives that are amazing anyway.  A course for snorkelling is not necessary IMO, but there is value in getting the low-down from a local who knows the area - currents especially, but also, where the good bits are. If you or your partner are nervous, a course might be good (although, it's less a course, and more of a guy in a boat pointing, IME). I wrote a primer for first-time snorkellers here:  http://www.quora.com/Snorkeling/What-should-a-beginner-snorkler-know-before-their-first-swim  Good luck, sounds like you're gonna have a ball!"
scuba,35l6ai,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,2,Tue May 12 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'm have a dm rating and based in Indonesia. Tourists like to hype on the Gilis for diving, but IMO Bali is better. The reefs are better, the marine life is better. Gilis are good for partying (on G. Trawangan) or sunbathing all day on the beach.   Stay in Bali and dive Tulamben, Amed, Pulau Menjangan, Padang Bai, Nusa Penida and Lembongan. Dive sites around these last two can have strong sudden current. So choose your dive center carefully.  Your partner can snorkel in all those places I've mentioned. Plus there are lots of things to do and see in Bali other than diving or snorkeling.  Komodo and Raja Ampat are amazing places, but they are harder to reach. Especially R Ampat. I would save it for next time if you're pressed for time."
scuba,35l6ai,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,2,Mon May 11 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"Gilis are good for partying (on G. Trawangan) or sunbathing all day on the beach.    That's exactly what I discussed with a friend last Saturday and already I was reconsidering our 4 days stay in Gili Trawangan. Me and my partner quickly get bored sunbathing and much rather enjoy cultural or sportive activities. We will definitely not be in the mushroom or lewd drinking mood so... should I just skip to Meno or even no Gilis?   Stay in Bali and dive Tulamben, Amed, Pulau Menjangan, Padang Bai, Nusa Penida and Lembongan.   Amed was on our list but for the rest I'll have to check a bit better. For the current I'm a good general swimmer with fins so I feel confident but yes obviously I don't want to take unnecessary risks.  Thank you for your answer having the opinion of a local matters quite a bit. Since I crave for remote places so Komodo and Raja Ampat are still high on my list but in only 3 weeks I don't want us to run around like headless chickens. Also it means I should probably focus on north or Bali and Lombok rather than Gilis if they are mostly loud tourist attractions."
scuba,35l6ai,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,2,Mon May 11 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"There is nothing much else to do on the Gilis beside diving, snorkeling, surfing, partying on sunbathing. But you can do all that in Bali and much more. And the diving/snorkeling and surfing are better in Bali anyway. The partying too.  Amed, Tulamben, and Padang Bai are all close to each other (about 1 hour drive from Padang Bai to Tulamben, passing Amed on the way). Stay in Amed or Padang Bai and dive Tulamben early morning or at night to avoid the crowd.    For the current I'm a good general diver with fins so I feel confident but yes obviously I don't want to take unnecessary risks.   You generally want to go with the flow when diving in current (drift diving), so buoyancy control is important to avoid bashing into bottom structure. Confidence is also important so you don't panic, which leads to mistakes.   Thank you for your answer, I crave for remote places so Komodo and Raja Ampat are still high on my list but in only 3 weeks I don't want us to run around like headless chickens.   You can definitely do Komodo or Raja Ampat in 3 weeks. Plenty of daily direct flights from Bali to Labuan Bajo, the closest town to Komodo. Plenty of daily flights from Bali to Sorong (Raja Ampat).   Maybe split half your time in Bali and half diving in Komodo or Raja Ampat? Liveaboard would be best in those places, but your partner doesn't dive so maybe resort based trip is better. Many nice resorts in Raja Ampat.   Have you considered Wakatobi?"
scuba,35l6ai,lookitskeith,2,Mon May 11 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yes I saw direct flights to Labuan Bajo in Flores then boat but our concern that internal flights have a reputation to be a bit random regarding scheduling. For Komodo I guess that's not a big deal for for Sorong where I saw no direct flight and is much more remote, I'm a bit worried, I wouldn't want us to miss our return flight. If we do skip the Gilis though I would be much more confident for a trip to Komodo.  I heard about Wakatobi and another good spot North West of Borneo but didn't really look into it yet."
scuba,35l6ai,garionhall,2,Mon May 11 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"Use Garuda, the state carrier to go to Raja Ampat. Plenty of direct flights from Bali to Makassar, then another flight to Sorong.

There is no diving off Northwest Borneo (Kalimantan is the Indonesian side of the island, Borneo is Malaysia), that I know of. The seas there are shallow and muddy. Northeast you have the Derawan islands in Indonesia and the Sipadan island in Malaysia.  You can snorkel in a jellyfish lake on Kakaban island (part of the Derawan group)."

scuba,35kkwt,Super_Natant,1 point,Mon May 11 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"Epoxy works fine glueing two pieces of neoprene together, but you will notice that on a good wet suit, seams are glues AND sewn ...  To replace the velcro, you definitely want to sew that. It is pretty easy to run it through a sewing machine. Just make sure you are not using cotton thread, find some nylon or other synthetic thread."
scuba,35kkwt,CanadianDiver,1 point,Mon May 11 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"sewing would give you a stronger repair in addition to glueing, but you can try aquasealing it in the short term."
scuba,35kkwt,runsongas,1 point,Mon May 11 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Just hand sew it with nylon or polyester thread and then aquaseal over the repair. Take ya 5mins.  You can replace the Velcro hook piece too with a chunk from the craft store too but I wouldn't bother.  Make sure you fold that part back on itself when you take the suit off and it won't tear up your suit.
scuba,35jjaq,Srekcalp,3,Sun May 10 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"So the dump valves on the jacket should unscrew (unless anyone knows differently but the ones I have come across all unscrew.) They might be a little stubborn if it's had a few years of abuse. Try running reasonably hot water on them to see if it helps loosen the thread. Also, try opening the dump valve as you unscrew it. Don't force them - last thing you wanna do is damage them.  Yes, you are right. Clip off the cable tie on the inflator and find one the same width to replace it with. Make sure you're tidy when clipping the end off and don't leave sharp edges. Don't start taking the inflator apart, I'll get onto that in a moment.  Leave the corrugated hose in place - I would imagine it's bonded to the inside of the bladder anyway, with the dump valves and inflator off you will be able to get the bladder more than clean.  I would recommend getting the inflator serviced - that is the best course of action. Steramine is normally used for cleaning and sanitising rebreathers but it's ideal for cleaning loads of different bits of kit. Mix some up in a bucket and pop your BCD in there. You don't really need to but give it a quick rinse afterwards.  If you don't service the inflator at least give a soak in the Steramine.  A VERY light coating of silicone grease on the face of the dump valve seal will help it to make an effective seal whilst in use. Check there is no corrosion on the springs while you're at it. Again, depressing the dump valve into the cap as you screw it should ensure it's back on properly in the right place - this is a little fiddly at times."
scuba,35jjaq,murkleton,2,Mon May 11 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, thank you, I got the valve cover off. Here are the photos. The spring doesn't seem rusted, as I assume rust is brown and leaves a mark when you rub it. But it does have this white chalky texture on it, is this salt? Can I just scrub that off with a tough brush and soap?  Which part should I grease?"
scuba,35jjaq,murkleton,2,Mon May 11 10:47:01 2015 UTC,"The face of that clear silicone seal where it meets the opposing side to the dump valve. Remember to use silicone grease and you only need a fine coating - wear gloves or something, it's awful stuff.  The spring looks fine, I'm not sure what that stuff is on there. Just scrub it clean."
scuba,35jjaq,murkleton,2,Mon May 11 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"I used silicone lubricant from a spray can, is that the correct stuff?"
scuba,35jjaq,murkleton,1 point,Mon May 11 21:03:02 2015 UTC,This stuff. Spray grease will get everywhere! SHould be able to get it at a DIY store or somewhere that sells car servicing stuff. Just make sure it's pure silicone. Handy for coating your knife blade too - you barely use them and it'll keep it's edge a lot longer. Don't be tempted to over do it though!
scuba,35jjaq,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Mon May 11 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"Spray grease will get everywhere!   Correct, it did. Then I panicked that it would melt the wing fabric, so then I washed it off"
scuba,35jjaq,CanadianDiver,2,Mon May 11 22:18:43 2015 UTC,Lol... it'll be fine. This why I told you to be sparing ;)
scuba,35jjaq,sharkiteuthis,2,Mon May 11 22:49:25 2015 UTC,"I think /u/murkleton is suggesting you lightly grease the part of that transparent membrane that closes against the opening in the bladder. That should help create a slightly better seal.   Again, depressing the dump valve into the cap as you screw it should ensure it's back on properly in the right place - this is a little fiddly at times.   Yeah, be careful here, this is fiddly. Don't start applying too much force until you're sure you've got the threads actually aligned - the threads are generally pretty fine and made of plastic, so they're easy to strip on some wings if you reassemble them often. The LPI port on my Hollis wing is a real bitch to get seated correctly just because of the geometry of the wing and it takes about 10 turns to get it fully seated.  It looks like there's no groove for the spring to sit in, so you don't need to worry about that. Just make sure you get the face of the dump valve sealed against the opening in the bladder, then get the threads aligned, then apply a little force to get it screwed on solidly.  You can test it by inflating it all the way and letting it sit overnight. I recently thought I had somehow punctured the bladder in my wing, but it turned out that I hadn't seated the OPV face correctly."
scuba,35jjaq,CanadianDiver,1 point,Mon May 11 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind there is an o-ring that sits between the screw on part of the dump/inflator and the wing itself - this is often slightly stuck to one side or the other and if you are not looking for it, you may think it is permanently attached. It is not and it will fall off and land out of view when you are not watching ... which if not put back in place when you reassemble the parts will leave you with a leaking bladder."
scuba,35jjaq,sharkiteuthis,2,Mon May 11 02:32:56 2015 UTC,"Not on all wings. My bought-used-but-never-dove (still had the tags on it) Hollis C60 doesn't have an O-ring, even though there appear to be molded slots for them. I even called them to verify this. It seems very odd to me, but the wing works fine.  I can take pictures if you're curious."
scuba,35jjaq,CanadianDiver,1 point,Mon May 11 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"I am not too familiar with Hollis gear, but I am surprised they don`t have any kind of washer on their bladder connections. If they say that is the way it is, then I guess you go with that. I was unable to find any kind of service manual for Hollis wings to either support or disprove this position."
scuba,35jjaq,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Mon May 11 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I couldn't find a service manual either, so I called tech support. Then made them double-check because I didn't believe them. You want me to take some pictures?"
scuba,35jjaq,eanx100,1 point,Mon May 11 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"No picture necessary, but I am curious ... Is one side or the other of the connection made from a softer material, or are they both hard plastic?"

scuba,35gl7w,rudefrognuts,2,Sun May 10 03:46:07 2015 UTC,I own a T2 and a have used several B2's and unless you have some specific reason to buy the titanium regulator- I wouldn't waste my money. If you travel a ton and use a lot of puddle jumpers and need to save every last ounce- sure go ahead. If you have more money than you know what to do with- sure go ahead. If you will be sailing or backpacking across the world and need something that can take a lot of abuse and won't need servicing as often- sure go ahead. Otherwise? I don't see the point in paying 2.5 times as much. That will pay for a lot of service.
scuba,35gl7w,stds9tng,1 point,Sun May 10 03:51:54 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense and exactly what I'm looking for.  The T3 is sounding more like a want than a need.
scuba,35gl7w,Barking_at_the_Moon,2,Sun May 10 04:00:58 2015 UTC,"Ti = marginally less weight (really, do you care about ounces), a lot more money (really, do you care about dollars) and you gotta be careful never to exceed recreational nitrox levels. Cracks pretty easily, too.  Buy the B2 unless you have swallowed the BS. Atomic does make very good regulators, by the way. High performance, reliable and easy to work on unless you get truly suckered by the environmental seals - that's pissing money into the wind on a piston regulator."
scuba,35gl7w,runsongas,1 point,Sun May 10 05:49:58 2015 UTC,"if you want environmental seals, go diaphragm. atomics way of packing the chamber with grease is pretty kludgy."

scuba,35gl7w,morphinedreams,2,Sun May 10 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"All atomic products breath the same. The B2 retains the comfort of the T3, in that there is less drag on the mouthpiece owing to weight, but as mentioned, unless you are somebody with limited strength/mobility and small reductions in weight across all your gear will make the difference between being able to dive and not being able to dive, or if you travel SO much that the few dollars you save per trip on baggage allowance will pay for the additional expense of the regulator, then get the B2. You might save money on the T3 servicing IF you don't dive a lot. But You have to be more careful with Nitrox because titanium does not like high levels of oxygen. Of course, if you like fireworks, you may look forward to your regs potentially catching fire if there's been a mistake with filling!"
scuba,35gl7w,texasguy911,1 point,Sun May 10 06:47:06 2015 UTC,"That is why you should buy the cheapest atomic. The rest is goes according a razor joke, do you care if it got 5 blades vs 4? 1st, 2nd, 3rd blade cuts, 4th makes the razor more expensive, 5th makes your balls look bigger."
scuba,35gl7w,morphinedreams,1 point,Sun May 10 07:00:47 2015 UTC,"Well the M2 has bells and whistles relating to construction materials that make it more suitable to extreme conditions such as ice diving, the B2 seems to be mostly designed for comfort - coming with the swivel and the reduced jaw fatigue from the Ti second stage.   For standard rec diving however, the Z series are probably indistinguishable from the others.  The only difference between regs is material construction and different materials are better for different operations. E.G you want a reg that won't freeflow in Antarctica or a reg that won't burst into flames with high O2 levels."
scuba,35gl7w,oriah,1 point,Sun May 10 10:03:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, B2 it is.  And you are right about the O2 dangers with titanium - I've read/researched that too.  I have never needed to go above 40% so far and I always check the O2 % before I hook my gear up to any filled tank.  I like fireworks but prefer regular instead of extra crispy lungs...  It looks like the M1 in the current Atomic lineup is the only regulator rated above 40% O2 - 50% out of the box/non-dedicated and up to 80% for a dedicated rig.  Well, if you dig deep enough, you will also find that some of the octos are good at up to 50% (SS1 for example); but, we weren't talking about octos.  The way I look at it is this will be my everyday regulator.  If I need to go beyond 40%, I will likely have to get a dedicated regulator for that anyway."
scuba,35gl7w,oriah,2,Sun May 10 11:45:27 2015 UTC,"I just bought all Atomic gear and have been speaking with Atomic exhaustively over the past week understanding their regulators. Based on what they told me, it seems as if their regulator design is consistent  across the board,  it's simply that they use different materials that will change the weight. And we aren't talking 10 lbs difference here. We are talking 1 to 2 lbs, tops. So really I'd say that if you don't travel you can get the B2 and you will be equally as happy with it."
scuba,35gl7w,oriah,1 point,Sun May 10 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, the weight difference between the T3 and B2 config I want is only like .4 lbs.  I'm good with that.  What did you end up going with?"

scuba,35gl7w,morphinedreams,1 point,Sun May 10 13:23:20 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you chose the ST1 over the B2?
scuba,35gl7w,phorkor,2,Sun May 10 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"I bought a bunch of stuff as a bundle. Originally I wanted the T3 but I got such a good deal on this bundle I couldn't refuse. If you live near a large dive shop like Divers Direct, go in there and chat with the reg specialists. They are awesome and can really lead you in the best direction."
scuba,35gl7w,phorkor,2,Sun May 10 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"ST1's first stage is all stainless steel and can take more of a beating than the B2. If you beat the crap out of your regs (IE: throw then in the back of a truck when done diving or toss them around in general), the ST1 is great. My instructor dives ST1's and he is really rough on his gear and the regs still breath great. They may look beat to hell, but it still functions flawlessly.   I dive M1's now, after switching from Scubapro, and any Atomic regs you go with will be great. Just depends on what you want to do with them. The T3, ST1 and M1's that are all environmentally sealed from the factory and are ready for crappy conditions and cold water, where the B2, Z2 and Z3 aren't. You can get them converted I believe, but I don't think they come sealed from the factory."

scuba,35gt1t,stds9tng,1 point,Mon May 11 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"most people don't need yearly service though as long as they take care of their regs. if you average 50 dives a year and service is 80 a year, you would be spending 320 over 4 years in order to keep free parts. whereas if you only needed service after 4 years (200 dives), you would be paying 80 for the rebuild and 80 for parts.  this is also the reason people buy hog regs and dive them till they need service and just sell them and buy another set. if you spend 300 dollars on 2 2nds and 1 1st, dive them for 3 to 4 years, and then sell them on ebay for 120 to 140, you would be ahead still compared to servicing a set yearly."
scuba,35gt1t,runsongas,2,Mon May 11 19:04:59 2015 UTC,"Really you can't go wrong with any of the brands you listed.  But I would go with HOG.  Main reason being absolute bang for the buck.  Great regs, later you can train to service them yourself they meet your DIN requirements and they are pretty inexpensive!  If you do go HOG you will end up getting an identical second for your ""octo"" which will be the way you'll want it going into tech.  Most people have concerns about servicing HOG but if your LDS is a retail / service center then no problems there.  Again any of those regs would be great. Atomic and Zeagle make great regs and Edge is a HOG brand.  Good luck and safe diving."

scuba,35gt1t,WnbTravellerDude,1 point,Sun May 10 21:50:28 2015 UTC,"All of the brands you listed are reputable, but I think an important thing to consider is the availability of service, and knowing what kind of person you are when it comes to planning.  If you're the type of person that plans far in advance, then it really might not matter which brand you buy, because when it's time to send it in for annual or bi annual service, you can mail it in well before you'll need it for a dive.  Personally, I know that I move around a lot, and that I'm not the best planner. Therefore, I chose a really common brand that can be serviced at almost any dive shop internationally. The last thing I want to do is have to choose between missing a dive and voiding my parts warrantee by missing a service.  As for my own gear, I have a scubapro mk17 1st stage, and an a-700 2nd stage. Of your listed choices, I really like Atomic for the following reasons: Made in the U.S. , two year service interval, high quality materials, and their increasing popularity in U.S. dive shops (hence more service options)."

scuba,35gt1t,texasguy911,-1,Sun May 10 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"Don't buy gear for years ahead. You will STILL change it. Your first gear is always a throw away.  You think now that you can predict what you'll need? No. As you will progress, you'll learn new things about gear and your preferences will change. You cannot now predict how. Doesn't matter what you'll buy, it will be not what you would like in 1-2 years from now."
scuba,35gt1t,texasguy911,2,Sun May 10 07:06:28 2015 UTC,"This is relatively poor advice.  Choosing wisely means you only buy it once, and why wait years to own gear. That is just bad advice."
scuba,35gt1t,CanadianDiver,1 point,Sun May 10 07:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'd call it mixed advice.   I don't really relish the idea of buying gear right after certification ... not because of the ""wrong gear"" mantra, but because most newly certified divers drop out of the sport before they have ~50 dives, so it's a waste of their money.  As such, I'd be more comfortable in saying to not buy much of anything until you've already plunked down the cash for the air/hotel for your third dive trip....and by dive trip, I mean a holiday where you're actually going to be diving every day, not a trip where you might go in the water for a day or even two.  FWIW, this point does get obfuscated with local diving, but even here, there's perspective...I'd say to rent for the whole first season and as one is starting to arrange & book local diveboats the second season, okay, you're sticking with stuff well enough such that the effective cost of owning your own gear will be less than $500 per dive :-)"
scuba,35gt1t,-hh,1 point,Sun May 10 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"My issue is with an arbitrary number of two or three years... which means NOTHING.  If you dive once a year... then owning your own gear is not a priority unless you have the disposable cash and are not worried about the costs involved.  That being said, when I certify divers in my club the majority will dive locally and can easily rack up 40 dives in a season ... some will dive significantly more. I have a smaller group of Open Water students that broke 80 dives their first season - waiting three years to buy your own gear is just bad advice.  Better advice - and the advice I give my students is to talk to other divers about the gear they use, try different types out in the pool and make an educated purchase. Avoid so called 'beginner packages' because there is no such thing as a beginner diver. Spend a bit more the first time so there is no second time (albeit we all know that even with very wise first time buys ... we all buy more gear, and then even more gear ... but not necessarily to replace our first gear)   I still use my first set of regs as my right post for tech dives... this is the same regs that I bought for use at dive number 7 for me. So these regs have hundreds and hundreds of dives on them and they are still my 'go to' regs - although I have 5 other sets."
scuba,35gt1t,CanadianDiver,1 point,Sun May 10 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"My issue is with an arbitrary number of two or three years... which means NOTHING   The problem is that diving stopped being ""only"" a local pastime decades ago, and today has a huge (& majority?) contingent of vacation-only warmwater types.  As such, adjustments need to take place when offering opinions and this one is centric to the holiday diver ... locally where I'm at near NYC, they represent around 75% of the customer base.   ...when I certify divers in my club the majority will dive locally and can easily rack up 40 dives in a season ... some will dive significantly more.    At 2 dives/day times Sat & Sun, that's ten weekends in a single summer without any weekends off for other pursuits...that's a conversion rate that I'm sure most shops would be quite jealous of.  To what specifically do you attribute your success?   I have a smaller group of Open Water students that broke 80 dives their first season waiting three years to buy your own gear is just bad advice.   Sure, for that statistical anomaly - but what percentage of all new students (& not just ""your"" students) does this represent?    Point being that generalized advice will never address rare exceptions, and we should resist the temptation to allow the 1% tail wag the 99% dog.  And my point really isn't as much about how active the divers are in their first year of certification - my point is that the next year, there will be fewer of them still active ... and the year after thst, fewer still, etc.   Regardless of your personal experience, DEMA studies have found that by five years after certification, only 20% remain active divers."
scuba,35gt1t,-hh,1 point,Mon May 11 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Diving is something you can do anywhere. Diving locally does not preclude diving on vacation. My divers that are hitting 40+ dives are typically doing so by diving both locally and on a warm water trip ... A club trip to Blackbeards will net 20 or so dives, a trip to Cozumel 12 to 15 ...   Our trips locally are typically 5 to 6 dives a weekend ... 3 or 4 on Saturday and typically 2 on Sunday. Some trips are three days. I have no trouble hitting 120 dives a year with two weeks of diving on vacation - the rest is local diving. Granted, I will be the first to admit that I am not normal. :)  Finally, I am not saying that everyone should buy their own gear but the math is pretty simple. Renting a full set of gear and 2 tanks costs about $200 (Toronto pricing) for a weekend. Even if you dive 5 weekends a year ... buying your gear starts to be a bit more attractive. Add in not having to rent on your vacation, and it pays for itself quickly - IF you are going to dive.  Should diver`s buy it right out of the gate ... well, it depends on what their plans are. Some people are hooked at day one, some are not. My point is, telling everyone to wait a few years without even asking about their potential dive frequency is bad advice.  Should divers get advice from other divers before making their decision ... definitely. Dont take the shop`s word on what you need.  And to an earlier question about successes. When I joined my club as an Open Water student we had about a 10% retention rate. I am now one of several instructors in the club and our retention rate is %60 or more. I am not claiming this success to be mine exclusively, this is absolutely a team effort and there are several factors that I attribute this to.  First, we are a non-profit club that runs a 12 week course. This alone weeds out some people that don`t want to commit to the sport.  Second, as a non-profit, we do not have a limit in the amount of time we spend with students before we start charging extra money for pool sessions. If a student needs extra work or one on one time to nail their skills - we do it and it is all part of their initial fee. We are looking to make more divers to go diving with rather than trying to run numbers to turn a profit. This REALLY means a lot.  Third, I personally focus on the FUN of diving. I have adopted more play time in the pool when I teach. This could be blowing bubble rings, playing with the Toypdoes or setting up a course of submerged floating hula hoops for buoyancy.  Lastly, being that we are a club, there is a very social aspect to our dive trips. We are often all together in a single lodge or in a block of motel rooms, so the diving is only part of the trip. We have a lot of fun out of the water as well."

Honestly- I'd love to know why. I've worked with scientific divers many many times and I've never seen anything remotely like this. A friend of mine did his scientific diver certification with Bernie Chowdhury and he would not have passed the class if his skills had been this poor.  I've worked with scientists who were not qualified to perform the dives that needed to be done and so they explained the procedures and techniques to be used to gather samples and then qualified divers performed them (also seen in the Nova special about diving Blue Holes in the Bahamas). The divers would bring cameras with them so that the researchers could verify the samples were collected correctly and that counts seemed accurate."

As a rec diver, your ""job"" is to look at stuff.  As a scientific diver, you might be doing any number of different experiments which in some way affect, directly, or indirectly, the environment in which the study is taking place.  Like, would we criticize putting a wave monitoring device, or a sediment trap, in and around a kelp forest?  Why not?  They're anchored to the seafloor after all, and thus in a tiny way are responsible for altering the environment....  It's a completely different comparison."

I've been certified as a scientific diver for longer than I care to admit and I am well aware of the problems and concerns of scientific diving. My problem isn't with this specific case (as I said- I don't have enough information to judge)- it's with the shear number of excuses being made:   ""They don't have time to dive well"" ""They're doing research and it's hard to do XYZ when neutral"" ""The research is more important than good technique"" ""That area isn't sensitive so it's ok to just lay on the bottom""   and so on and so forth.

If it is reef or not is irrelevant , I guess you never had the pleasure of diving in such an amazing place like this where all areas of the underwater world are teaming with life if it's reef or sandy bottom. To put it very simply they were researching one animal but killing many others behind them with their lack of consideration.

A few years ago there was only a few large ones which would be fairly noticeable should they go missing but now there is so many smaller ones dotted around the area and particularly in the shallows where divers don't go (for fear of a propeller strike) that if one or two went missing I don't believe they would be noticed . With that being said they seem to be somewhat respected and considered a no go by the fishermen , any where else though just like the lobsters means once noticed they will be gone fairly quick. Just this morning I saw a fisherman come in with a big octopus and hand it to the marine protection officer , judging by his expression and the direction he made this octopus was for lunch.

Experienced divers aren't fools and it simply isn't that hard to teach someone to perform counts or collect samples (scientific diver certification courses are much easier than any technical course I've taken). The Nova/PBS special on diving blue holes in the Bahamas involved experienced divers collecting samples for a biologist who wasn't qualified to perform the dives. If you're really concerned they aren't doing it right- you send them down with a camera and record the process. That way you can verify it for yourself.  I also don't understand it from a safety perspective. If you don't have perfect trim and buoyancy control- are you going to be a safe diver when task loaded with things like sample counts and specimen collection? Should these same divers be performing dives on a wall with a bottom hundred of feet below? Or what about in a cave? At what point do we stop and say ""you need some more experience before you're qualified to do this""?  Obviously I don't know the specifics of this case- and I only glanced at the pictures- but their general technique looks awful. If you want to be a scientific diver- that's awesome- but perfect your technique first. We don't send scientists into outer space without a ton of training- so why do we send scientists into an environment just as unforgiving without a lot more training?"
scuba,35dzr4,stds9tng,2,Sat May 9 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that it looks awful.  However, it is a work dive. The seabed is massive and they are not going to wreck it all, no matter how badly they dive.   I am currently in mid of simulating global supply chain network for a Uni research... I d 10/10 take well formed hypothesis and solid methods than a great diving buoyancy."
scuba,35dzr4,MasherusPrime,1 point,Sat May 9 23:48:41 2015 UTC,I d 10/10 take well formed hypothesis and solid methods than a great diving buoyancy.   You're not formulating a hypothesis underwater- you're doing that ahead of time. The purpose of the dive is to collect evidence that supports or denies your hypothesis. You don't need to even know the hypothesis is to do the diving task- just how to perform the observation or collect the samples. In many ways that's a better system anyway as it can eliminate biases that the researcher may have.  Solid methods for observation and collection of samples are easily taught- certainly easier to teach than good diving skills.
scuba,35dzr4,pinch-n-roll,2,Sun May 10 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"You're not formulating a hypothesis underwater- you're doing that ahead of time.   :-D  Oh really? I always do my best work at 30m.   Which is harder?   Diving for 100h to learn breathing.  Science degree plus phd in 8 years or  IQ at 99% to actually have genuine input.   Kids dont know how to dive, i get it. However, they are trying to do something that is better for the all of the diver. I wouldnt care less if they brought an excavator IF the hypothesis is beefy enough."

You obviously have very strong opinions on the subject so I doubt I can convince you otherwise but that said- what are you doing underwater as a scientific diver that requires ""a science degree plus PHD""? Seriously...  Most scientific diving I've been involved in involves measuring, sampling, counting, whatever- it's not rocket science. Why do you feel a ""scientist"" who dives poorly is better able to perform sample collections or measurements than a well trained diver?  Much of the research on caves in Florida was done by trained cave divers performing work for scientists on the surface (such as the installation of radio locators).   I wouldnt care less if they brought an excavator IF the hypothesis is beefy enough.    Hey- Cousteau used to use dynamite to blow up reefs because he thought his work was ""beefy enough"" :)"

If you cant dive and the program cant afford a good one, should you abandon the research?

I was specifically referring to the measuring, sampling, and observation as not being rocket science. Diving isn't rocket science either- but it takes a lot longer to truly master diving than it does to learn how to properly collect samples and perform measurements.   If you cant dive and the program cant afford a good one, should you abandon the research?    First- I hope by ""can't dive"" you mean ""can't dive well"" because if you can't dive at all- you sure as hell don't belong underwater and should abandon the research.  Second- what good is trying to perform research with poor quality data? If you can't easily and effortlessly control your buoyancy and trim- how accurate are your counts and measurements really going to be?  If you want to do research underwater- then I don't think asking you to become a competent diver is too much to ask- both for the quality of the research you'll be able to do, as well as for diver safety.   I think it is kind of funny that strip dynamiting reef is daily fishing method in most non protected reefs in Phillippines. Yet these guys whine about some kids laying on the bottom when sampling.    You're making a poor comparison here. No one here thinks dynamiting a reef for fishing is a good idea- it's atrocious. a) I do complain about it even though b) I don't live in the Philippines and have no say in their laws and c) these are fisherman who don't know or don't care about conservation because they can't put food on the table.

When you dive in PG, the dynamiting can be heard while in water. It sounds like P-tsss. PG is fine since they are looking out for the dive sites, but go dive in the rest of Phillippines.

No one would be mad enough to use dynamite here as all sorts of allegations of being a member of the NPA would be made for having an explosive. To summarize dynamite fishing does not affect PG.   Using that comparison is like saying I am free to toss my garbage into the sea because there is oil tankers leaking crude oil all over the place. Everybody has their small part to play to make progress and make improvements. Not kicking and smashing the corals doesn't cost anything but a little concentration.  Usually dive sites themselves are a no go for the fishermen with dynamite , I was never referring to an uneducated poor fisherman than can barely count to 100. I am referring to someone claiming to be a scientist doing good but in actual fact they were causing damage while doing that. Plus is was never kneeling , it was kicking and dragging.  I can tell from the attitudes of this thread that there is a lot of progress that needs to made to improve divers behavior.  Maybe those scientists should have been listening out for dynamite fishing and directing their attention towards that instead of telling us there is lots of fish down there and we should protect them ? , thanks guys."

Work your way up in 30 foot increments and you also have to earn all other certs separately. That's the way AAUS works. You don't get to do science wherever you want.

If you're trying to collect something off substrate or fix a piece of equipment that's attached to the bottom, any delicate work that requires more focus than, eg, taking a picture, is challenging.

Lifting them solo is hard work and getting them back into the RHIB costs me a lot in beers for my buddies. more gas == more buoyancy change. If you're putting more kilgrams of gas in to start with then that's more weight you're going to have to compensate for as you breathe it off. As it happens for my setup (drysuit, thick steel backplate) I don't need any lead for when I use my 300 bar twins (I need 6kg with my 232bar twins) but that means no weightbelt to drop in an emergency - I'm reasonably confident that my drysuit and twin-bladder wings with a redundant gas source means I've got enough to get me out of the sticky stuff but it is undeniably an extra risk Fills - I'm lucky in that there is a club in the city where I live where I can get trimix up to 300 bar. Locally, there's a couple of places that'll do nitrox to 300 bar. Further afield it's quite often you'll only be able to get air to 300 bar or 232 bar only. Not sure what the Netherlands are like, but something to check before you join the world of high pressure cylinder ownership! Your regs are fine (I have the exact same ones!) but just remember you won't be able to use A-clamp regs on a 300 bar fitting 300 bar tanks are steel only. If you're diving dry - put steels on your back and use aluminium for stage cylinders.

An interesting nomenclature note is that in North America we size the tanks based on the surface volume of the gas inside, i.e. at 1 bar. So a low pressure 100 cubic foot tank has the same amount of gas as a high pressure one but with a difference in the actual volume.  Anyways, I dive LP108s and they are great tanks.

Go for the 232 bar tank, no shop out there (that I encountered at least) will be filling to 300 bars, it's better just to get a bigger tank. Instead of a single 15L, you could also consider a twin 7L set: nearly the same capacity as the 15L (ok, 1L less), but because it's two small tanks next to each other, they will cause less drag when moving through the water and they will feel more stable. Most BCDs will fit a small double set like a D7 quite easily. A twin 8.5L is also an option, but due to the relatively strange size, they are relatively expensive (a D8.5 is (new) the same price as a D12).  Also, because of Van der Waal's gas law, you will not be able to get the ideal 300 bar pressure inside your tank, making the difference between the single 300bar 12l, and the 232bar 15l smaller.   12l, 232bar = E210 12l, 300bar = E260 15l, 232bar = E250   I'd go for the 15l if I were you.  As for the final question: steel, no doubt. Diving in the Netherlands, you're either using a 7+ mm neoprene wetsuit, or a drysuit. Last thing you'll need is having to add yet more weight to offset the positive buoyancy of an alu tank at the end of your dive."
scuba,35czsj,sukosevato,5,Sat May 9 08:35:51 2015 UTC,"To add to this, have a look at the following table. As you can see, at 300K (27C) and 200 bar the compressibility factor (Z) of air is 1.0326, at 300 bar it increases to 1.1089. What this means is if you're at 300 bar there is 1.1089 times less air in a tank than you'd expect if it were an ideal gas. So going from a 200 bar tank to 300 bar means that you get 6.88% less extra air than you'd expect.    12L, 200 bar => 2400L of air expected 12L, 200 bar => 2324L of actual air (3.16% less than expected) 12L, 300 bar => 3600L of air expected 12L, 300 bar => 3246L of actual air (9.83% less than expected) 15L, 200 bar => 3000L of air expected 15L, 200 bar => 2905L of actual air  15L, 232 bar => 3480L of air expected 15L, 232 bar => 3314L of actual air (Z of 1.05, 4.77% less than expected)   So even though you'd think that a 12L, 300 bar tank would have 120L more air than a 15L, 232 bar tank. Due to the way air behaves when compressed, it's actually the other way around and the 15L tank contains 68L more.  If you add on to that all the other things others have already pointed out, I'd go for the 15L or double 12s. In the Netherlands I've also seen few filling stations that are equipped for 300 bar."
scuba,35czsj,nl_the_shadow,1 point,Sat May 9 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"Not that many places fill to 300 bar and when they do you end up with about 270.   Why don't you just get a set of doubles?

scuba,35czsj,CanadianDiver,1 point,Sat May 9 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"I think you may be confusing a 300 bar valve connection with a 300 bar air fill... 300 bar is over 4300 PSI and this is a very rare working pressure for scuba equipment.  LP tanks - 184 Bar or 2640 PSI (give or take regional variances)  HP tanks - 237 Bar or 3442 PSI ....  A 300 bar valve is only available as DIN, and has a deeper thread than a 200 bar valve. A 200 bar valve can be easily converted from DIN to Yoke using a thread adapter. For this reason, I would suggest a 200 BAR valve rather than a 300 ...   Tanks and their working pressure are a different matter. Most dive shops these days can fill a HP tank (237 Bar or 3442 PSI) ... so size and weight are your considerations. How much gas do you need vs how much pain you want to put your back through.   I have a bunch of LP 17L tanks ... and if I was to do it again, I would get HP 12L tanks for my doubles and stick with the LP17's for singles..."
scuba,35czsj,Crash_Coredump,2,Sat May 9 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"300bar is fairly common at least here in Sweden, lots of people use 8L/300bar instead of 12L 232bar. Not that much less gas, but in a smaller bottle that weighs a few kg less."

scuba,357y3u,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 7 23:15:28 2015 UTC,"Well, depends on your balance of your rig. However, I usually see the camband positioned somewhere 1/3 or 1/4 down, not like 1/6 in your case.

scuba,357y3u,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 7 23:22:06 2015 UTC,In this case I think it depends on the rig. If I'm using the rails with my Stealth- they are so far down I could never put the tanks on and still put them under my shoulder bungees. If you're diving something like the Razor with the tanks attached to rings your waist band then they would need to be much higher.  Judging from the pictures of the ScubaPro- it looks much more like the Stealth with the butt plate than something like the Razor. His tanks look so low that even when he gets into trim they're not going to be that high.  You mentioned diving the SMS100 which is a long rig- I'm surprised you can move the cambands up that far and still get the bungees around the valves.

What makes the dive a bit more dangerous than a standard tourist cave is the entrance/exit to the cave. The entrance is somewhat tight and has a lot of cobble and boulder size brakedown that can trap divers at the exit, if they are not prepared. The cave is not incredibly complex or technical. I believe most, if not all, of the deaths are due to inadequate training and equipment.  The real issue with diving this cave is actually gaining access. The cave is home to a few federally listed species, and therefore limited to scientific use. There are only two access permits available at the moment and both are filled.

Fighting to remain calm in the ensuing blackout, the divers ditched their expensive camera and scrambled for the guideline, following its arrows up to a shallower depth to decompress before surfacing. Visibility was so bad down there, Misiaszek said, that he passed Price along the way and never knew it.  ""You couldn't tell up from down, left from right,"" Kathy Misiaszek says.

The abandoned video camera continued recording until it ran out of tape. The divers returned to retrieve the camera and the remains. They later watched the videotape run in quiet blackness until its end, as if the camera were the eyes of a diver left behind to die.

I tend to do this with slow ascents and over-running my computer generated stop times. I don't mess with tables as they are good physics and have no built in 'age' variables. The computer on the other wrist is running 30/80 Gradient factors not because I think that GFs are wonderful just that they are convenient.  I have yet to be convinced that 'gym fit' is relevant to diving and all the people that want to tell me it is seem to be selling their other hobby, although grossly fat can't be good for anybody doing anything. I'm not skinny but I haven't had a heart attack in 14 years and I didn't enjoy the first ones so I'm not planning any more. I think the most important trick in UK waters is to stay warm.  </shrug>"

I have it and was recently on a tech diving expedition and a fellow diver started showing symptoms of DCI on the way back in the boat.  Even though we were a boat load of tech-certified Dive Masters, turned out only 3 of us had O2 provider certs (one of them was the operator who was driving the boat).  We had a 80cu tank of O2 ready to go and got our buddy comfy and on the good gas.  He went for a ride in the pot, but was fine afterwards (no more diving that trip for him though).  TL;DR> O2 certification isn't as common as I thought.  You never know when you're going to need it.  O2 kits aren't stupid-expensive, buy one."
scuba,356ju6,LoosingInterest,2,Thu May 7 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"Knowing how to give O2 is fairly important. At my club, every diver gets instructions on how to use the tank, and is supposed to do a refresher every two years. We leave Dan out of it, though. Just makes things more expensive."

But even without  wanting to go that direction any time soon, it's still a very useful skill and knowledge set to have. If you're in the unfortunate situation where you actually had to rescue another diver, you'd also want to help them get the best first aid for about any diving related accident, i.e. immediately providing them with O2.  At my club, we teach the O2 course for the price the books and gas costs us: the instructors are not paid, and no profit is made. That's how highly we value it.  If you really want to go crazy, also attend a DAN Advanced Oxygen Provider course. Being able to do CPR while doing ventilations with 100% O2 is a great skill to have."

scuba,354d68,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 7 12:26:07 2015 UTC,If you are going to do classes and want to buy equipment- most shops will give you a break. I've bought stuff from Pan Aqua before and they're a bunch of good people- knowledgeable and friendly. They also offer rescue classes throughout the summer and do the classroom stuff after work so you can more easily fit it into a busy schedule.  I haven't been to Gotham since the new crew took over.  Empire divers is a good bunch of folks as well- though depending on where you live it may be harder to get to.  There are also several good shops in NJ- but if you don't live there and own a car- it's going to be tough.
scuba,354d68,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 7 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"Oh- one more thing about Pan Aqua-  They have a 1 year exchange policy on all the gear they sell. If you buy a BCD, dive it for 3 months and decide you hate it- you can bring it back to them and return it for a different one. Seriously- who lets you return used gear? (They service it and put it in their rental fleet so it's not a big deal to them)  I don't know of any other shop with such a generous policy and I know a couple of people that took advantage of it. One bought a BCD they hated, and another bought a pair of fins they hated. Pan Aqua took both back, no questions asked (well- except for ""what didn't you like about it"" so they could make a better recommendation).  Without the return policy- both of them would have had to try the sell the gear on ebay or craigslist and would definitely have lost a bunch of money in the process. The ease of the whole process made these guys life long customers.  For a new diver that doesn't know what they're looking for and is worried about buying the wrong gear- their policy eliminates all the worry."

The benefit of buying gear from a traditional dive retailer is you are establishing a relationship with a dive shop: for training, trips. equipment repair and advice. However, now with the internet you can do most of that yourself. So it is really personal choice, if you want a person to person contact, go to a traditional dive shop (and pay more). If you don't mind do your own research and are comfortable with making decisions, you can go with an ""on-line"" retailer like Leisure Pro to purchase gear. The fact that Leisure Pro has a showroom is great if you actually want to see the gear before you buy."

If you can get a hold of the service kits for your regs (some are much easier than others) by the time you pay the cost of a two or three years of annual service you can get the gear to do a fairly decent job yourself and if you are off warranty you can do service as needed rather than as required by a technician who might not put as much attention to detail in the work as you would.
scuba,353m2s,runsongas,1 point,Thu May 7 04:36:00 2015 UTC,This unfortunately is not an appropriate solution for most divers.  Opening up and tinkering with your life support without the appropriate tools is a recipe for disaster.
scuba,353m2s,CanadianDiver,1 point,Thu May 7 14:22:27 2015 UTC,"I've researched it a decent bit, someday I want to take the TDI course on servicing the HOG D1 regulators when I have time to get into more advanced diving certs. For me the problem is the closest LDS is 30 miles and only services Scubapro and Sub Gear, next closest is 50 miles and only serviced Dive Rite, the closest one for servicing my Aeris regs is third closest and is 110 miles away while my dad's old Sherwood isn't worth the cost of servicing but would make for a nice dedicated tire inflation reg or back up reg/warm water single tank dives with some new second stages. If a reg has a problem when I check it the week before for a dive trip it would be nice to be able to check it out and test it in a pool since the local lakes have only a handful of dive shops at best and brands are all over with most service kits being ordered as needed, that said I won't be touching them until I get the proper gear and knowledge."
scuba,353m2s,-hh,1 point,Thu May 7 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think divers should learn exactly how their gear works and should be able to service it ... but this is not the reality. You require proper tools, attention to detail and the correct replacement parts and this is not something that most divers are capable of doing."
scuba,353m2s,runsongas,1 point,Thu May 7 23:28:06 2015 UTC,tools aren't that hard to get from scubatools.com and the manuals are easy to google up if you are inclined to learn. parts seem to be more of an issue for a lot of brands. it helps a bit if you can find a lds that will sell you trident parts which can cover older models and the low to mid end equipment.
scuba,353m2s,-hh,1 point,Fri May 8 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"That the tools exist for sale is not in dispute. How many divers will go to trouble of rounding them all up versus say getting by with vice-grips. How many divers will do it properly or go to the trouble of setting up a magnehelic and properly adjusting their second stage versus winging it with a bucket of water ...  It is certainly possible, but not practical or safe for the majority of divers."
scuba,353m2s,eanx100,1 point,Fri May 8 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"My concern is that it jumped a lot (~$100) in just one year ... and I'm supposed to still be getting the ScubaPro 'free parts for life'.    And of course it is a coincidence that this year, they didn't happen to provide a detailed receipt like they always have done before."
scuba,353m2s,butterbal1,1 point,Thu May 7 12:42:15 2015 UTC,it sounds like you aren't getting the parts for free. whether the shop screwed up or are trying to pull a fast one on you.

I've been tempted to contest the credit card bill to force them to give me a detailed receipt, but I'm way too busy right now getting my gear packed.  They may have ""won"" an extra $100 this year, but they might permanently lose my business to the other local SP shop, which is only an extra 20 minute drive away.  -hh"
scuba,353m2s,Fap-0-matic,1 point,Thu May 7 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"I've had pretty poor quality with reg servicing from all the local shops I've tried.      There's the shop that takes 4 months, but actually does a good job. There's the shop where the grumpy shop owner tried to charge me full service price when I dropped off the regs and when I picked them up. There's the shop where the certified technician doesn't know wtf he's doing.   He incorrectly reassembled my first stage ... and did the same thing to 2 of my buddies.   Its cheaper and easier to just not get my regs serviced and buy new Hogs every 2 years"
scuba,353m2s,-hh,1 point,Thu May 7 08:23:01 2015 UTC,Hog does offer that TDI course on doing your own service....
scuba,353m2s,steamy_hippo,1 point,Thu May 7 08:59:18 2015 UTC,"I've thought about it.   But even servicing myself I doubt it would be much cheaper than just buying new regs every 2 years and selling the old ones on ebay.  If you're patient, diverssupply periodically sells HOG 1st+2nd for $179.   And you can get the D1 upgraded to D1 cold for like $10 or $20 but you have to call them directly because the website can't do that."
scuba,353m2s,kroneksix,1 point,Thu May 7 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"Is the shop still a scuba pro dealer? If they aren't then getting parts can be very difficult, probably as expensive as if you bought the kits."

I've asked them for a detailed receipt ... got back an email that said that their labor rates did go up by $10/stage, but that only is able to explain only $40 of the ~$100 Year-over-Year increase.    That ""missing"" receipt is why I suspect they're now trying to pull a fast one by charging me for parts, even though I've been keeping up my end of the ""Free Parts for Life"" contract.    The unfortunate part about this is that I've been using this shop for at least 25 years and under the prior owners, everything has been utterly solid.  The new owner though..."
scuba,353m2s,stds9tng,1 point,Thu May 7 15:05:45 2015 UTC,aqualung gives our free parts for life when you get your regulator serviced and recorded properly annually. Sherwood has just done the same with their regs.
scuba,353m2s,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Thu May 7 03:57:51 2015 UTC,Mares and apeks as well. 11-13 month interval. Costs me about 90$ for my doubles and 75 for my single reg sets
scuba,353m2s,stds9tng,2,Thu May 7 11:46:56 2015 UTC,"Packages can be a deal- or not. It depends entirely on the package.  I will say this- less is more. Simple BCD, simple regulator, brass and glass SPG (no consoles), wrist mounted computer and so on generally have a much longer useful lifetime than more integrated gear does (consoles and things).  How long have you need diving?  Why do you want your own gear? (Are you doing DM or instructor or something and gear is required- in which case I'd say don't get the i3 because it's less common when instructing- or do you just want to save money by not having to rent for a long time).  What kind of diving are you doing now, and what kind do you want to get into? (Reef now- technical wreck diving later?).  You'd be hard pressed to go wrong with AquaLung gear (or any of the other major brands). It really comes down to personal preference in most cases."
scuba,353m2s,CatnipFarmer,1 point,Wed May 6 20:54:08 2015 UTC,"Good call on a lot of these. I've only been diving for a year or so, but it's cheaper in the long run for me to have my own gear as I work towards Master Diver. They also don't rent the gear out at the dive shop in Honduras, so I'll need to bring my own.   I'd want to do wreck diving later, but mostly photography/video for now. :)"

They also don't rent the gear out at the dive shop in Honduras, so I'll need to bring my own.    In that case- less is definitely more. A console may be ok for now- but if you end up with two computers- or a wrist compass- the console is now just wasting space.  Same goes for regs and things. Second stages on the LPI are essentially a gimmick and won't be useful if you become a more advanced diver. They're also awkward to instruct in unless your students all have them.  Try to find a basic dive computer- preferably one with a ""gauge mode"" that you can use for the rest of your diving days.  Keep it simple and inexpensive. Chances are good you're going to end up replacing a lot of gear before you find a configuration you really like."
scuba,353m2s,Crash_Coredump,2,Wed May 6 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"On the topic of consoles, do what you are comfortable with, but when I got rid of my console and just kept the SPG there and then moved the computer and compass to my wrist, I felt so much more comfortable. It was nice to just have everything up front and in my field of vision while in trim."
scuba,353m2s,gorek123,3,Wed May 6 22:07:24 2015 UTC,Yeah- i just find consoles awkward. Putting compass and computer on your wrist really cleans up your equipment and helps you streamline.

scuba,353m2s,Walterthethird,2,Sat May 9 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"if you are just looking for gear that works and can get you into the water, packages are ok. it rarely is composed of the best gear possible for each piece. pretty much every brand has good items and bad items in their lineup. i would rent a bc and regs if this is your first dive trip. a good nitrox computer is a good choice for an early purchase."
scuba,352d8n,what_the_who_ha,4,Wed May 6 15:03:29 2015 UTC,Do a night dive!!!!! You know how you feel like your on another planet when you dive? Multiply that by 10000000 on a night dive. Night dives are some of the most surreal experiences I have ever had! I remember one night dive where there was especially active bio-luminescence. As far as you looked there were little tiny bulbs of light flashing on and off in the most brilliant electric blue. I honestly felt like I was floating through the stars and never wanted to surface.  Just do it and come back and tell us how amazing it was!
scuba,352d8n,kdog92,3,Wed May 6 17:19:11 2015 UTC,I had the best night dive in Cancun! When we went there was so much plankton that you didn't even need to use the flashlight provided. One of the most memorable things that we saw was an octopus lazily making its way over coral. The head was changing colors and it was really just an amazing experience.
scuba,352d8n,gabsalot,2,Wed May 6 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"I did notice one good thing about a night dive, the lack of a moon during the time I will be there. I would guess that would make things more active, and more outer spacey!"

scuba,352cim,Bconz56,3,Wed May 6 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"Most common problem that causes a leaky mask is that you have the strap too tight.  It only needs to be tight enough to keep it on your head ... water pressure does all the work as far as keeping the seal. If it is too tight, it will break the seal and leak."
scuba,352cim,CanadianDiver,1 point,Wed May 6 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"So by that standard do i have to equalize the mask pressure when going deeper?  I think i noticed it was leaking when i did my certification dives, but not so much in the pool doing skills at only 10ft.  I guess just loosen it even more at the surface could work too?"
scuba,352cim,CanadianDiver,2,Wed May 6 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Normal use of a mask doesn't change. You will need to equalize the pressure the same as always.  The issue, and lots of new divers do this, is when the mask strap is too tight it pulls the sides of the mask in closer and creates a crinkle or uneven fit against your face and thus a leak.  You really don't need a lot of pressure to keep the mask in place and with masks these days being so soft, too much pull back will create leak points."
scuba,352cim,rebo2,1 point,Thu May 7 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think shaving will help much. I've had no issue with a beard and heard others say the same. But since you are only diving to 10 feet, maybe it will get better when you are deeper. Also having a little bit of water in your mask isn't going to ruin your dive. In fact you can use it to clear up a bit of fog."
scuba,352cim,murkleton,1 point,Thu May 7 08:05:38 2015 UTC,No I've used it to go down 60 before and it just continued to leak after a certain point and it leaked at 10. I think it might be a placement issue because of the liquid skin mask. It's a small enough leak that continues to grow and I don't want to have to clear every minute it's frustrating and I'm afraid it will ruin the experience in Cozumel.
scuba,352cim,-hh,1 point,Thu May 7 10:25:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my liquid skin spare mask don't like my moustache."
scuba,352cim,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Sun May 10 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"Simple Answer...yes, you do have to equalize within your mask.  My mask leaks depending on my mustache .. I've subconciously adapted by a little pressure thru the nose to continuously keep the water pushed out.  I generally end up diving with a wet nose and don't notice it unless I go inverted/upside down for an UW photo, at which the leak becomes stronger and its filling up at my eyebrows."
scuba,352cim,underwaterbear,5,Fri May 8 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"You may also want to fiddle around with the positioning a bit.  I have the same mask I think (X-vision liquid skin - not to say it's an issue with the mask), and sometimes have the same issue with a slight leak under the nose area.  It's not dive-endingly bad, just a little annoying to need to clear every now and then.  If I position the mask a few mm lower on my face, it usually helps, and could explain why it only happens sometimes.  Probably something to do with increased upper lip - skirt surface area.  The lenses are so big this doesn't really affect vision/FOV.  Also, the strap's positioning could be pulling the mask back at an odd angle, making for a loose seal somewhere - try it a bit higher/lower than you have it.  On my old mask which fit similarly fine, I had one of those neoprene mask strap cover thingees as a freebie, but with it on, my strap kept sliding low, and caused my mask to leak quite a bit (I'd have to clear it every ~2 minutes).  Took it off, and it went back to normal."
scuba,352cim,Ragelols,0,Wed May 6 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"This is really, helpful.  I thought maybe it was a positioning issue, but haven't had a chance to test the theory out again."
scuba,352cim,spearchunker,1 point,Wed May 6 21:31:53 2015 UTC,Strap position is a leak or no leak thing for me. Definitely experiment.
scuba,352cim,underwaterbear,2,Sun May 10 08:05:29 2015 UTC,"Its pretty common, some people have big ridges(?) under their nose that will let water in and it isn't always the masks fault. Best bet would be to get some Vaseline and put a load under your nose before you put your mask on."
scuba,352cim,misplacedyank,2,Wed May 6 16:26:06 2015 UTC,I dove with a beard for the first time this past weekend. My mask leaked a lot. I had to clear it a lot. Not that big of a deal.  A little water in the mask shouldn't force you to surface.
scuba,352cim,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Wed May 6 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Trim under your nose slightly before diving.
scuba,352cim,misplacedyank,1 point,Sun May 10 08:05:56 2015 UTC,Is it a good fitting mask or did you buy it because people recommended it?
scuba,352cim,underwaterbear,1 point,Wed May 6 15:36:33 2015 UTC,"I bought it at my local dive shop where I tried it on and did that little suction test I mentioned.  I specifically bought the liquid mask bc it was told to me they were better fits.  I went in bc i had a similar problem with another mask, leading me to believe i may not be doing something right, but i find it hard to believe i'm putting it on wrong, yet here i am."
scuba,352cim,murkleton,3,Wed May 6 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Did you try it on with a snorkel/reg in your mouth?  Your face, particularly in the upper lip and nose area where you have the leak, is a different shape when you have a reg in your mouth.  One quick fix would be to smear your upper lip with Vasoline. Like, a lot of it. It'll be super fucking gross, but I bet it stops the leak.  I've done 90 minute dives with my backup mask, which has exactly the same problem. While it's not dive-endingly-bad, it gets really old to clear your mask every 3 minutes, especially in 45F water."

Mr Scott, who was the gentleman handling the octopus in the video, has had his SSI Instructor qualification removed and his dive center, Mark Scott Diving Vietnam, is no longer an SSI center. Here is the official announcement from SSI:  Please note that Mark Scott, Mark Scott Diving Vietnam, divingvietnam.com and Aloha Vietnam Scuba Divers are no longer SSI Dive Professionals or SSI Dive Centres. Now and hereafter, the named parties may not represent themselves as such in any way, shape or form.  Mr Scott has made numerous posts pointing out that there are other videos showing marine life harassment on the web (whilst claiming that his handling of the creature in question  was not harassment!) Hence he is implying that as other people are doing it, it is OK for him to do so. To extend this argument would it be acceptable to steal or murder, as it is an unfortunate fact that many other people do so?  This is why it is so good that SSI has shown such great leadership in dealing with this situation. In my opinion, they deserve the support and respect of the diving community for doing so.

scuba,34yd52,alex27123344,3,Wed May 6 00:07:58 2015 UTC,Eco terrorists?? This guy must be from another planet. I wish he'd go back.
scuba,34yd52,icarusgirl,6,Wed May 6 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"Though this was a clearly egregious example, I've been on plenty of tropical dives where dms seek out and rile octos out of their crevices to show the tourists. It seems like it's more the norm than the exception. Why do they do this? They want to show the customers exotic animals and interactions,  and that increases their tips,  which is sometimes their only take-home pay. I cannot believe for a second that any agency like SSI or padi are not aware that this is going on day in and day out. So are they only taking action because this particularly bad example is getting widespread attention?"
scuba,34yd52,ElGuano,9,Tue May 5 19:47:06 2015 UTC,Yes.
scuba,34yd52,grapefruit855,7,Tue May 5 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"As I also posted on this page where the dive instructor tried to excuse his actions, I've been diving for 2 decades in many different countries, and I've never seen a DM or instructor do this. Have I seen them coax an animal like a moray out of its crevice & interact with it, primarily on its terms? Yes. But I've never seen someone grab, grope, harass, and abuse an animal this way. I was revolted by that video.   If I ever do see a DM behave that way on a dive, I'll confront him during and after the dive, I'll report him to his employer and agency, and I certainly will not tip him. Only by speaking up can we slow down the spread of this kind of rank stupidity underwater, which this instructor has undoubtedly taught his students. Don't excuse this guy by saying this kind of thing happens all the time--step up and make sure it doesn't happen all the time!! Teach dive center staff that they won't be financially rewarded for behavior that damages the underwater world that we all love."
scuba,34yd52,zombieregime,2,Wed May 6 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"This one is really bad,  and the worst I've seen. But I have definitely seen shades of the exact same thing. Most of the time the octo isn't so clearly trying to flee but they always try to get away (why wouldn't they?). This kind of thing happens A Lot,  and it's a damned shame that it does."
scuba,34yd52,sdbarker99,2,Wed May 6 00:42:24 2015 UTC,"In regards to the ""humane"" treatment of animals I feel like more often than not it takes a blatant outcry from the public in reaction to one extreme highly publicized event in order for people in general to question the practices currently taking place. I feel like this is mostly because your average person who does not interact with that animal or have much knowledge of the animal probably does not intuitively realize that the practice is humanely questionable. For instance how many people out there fully understand the amount of distress the octopus is under when it is inking as frequently and as severely as the one in the video? How many people realize that animal could easily die from that? It might seem obvious to you or I but I witness the general public every day handling animals in ways that are deleterious to them. Hence why education staff is posted at all ""touch"" exhibits at aquariums. SSI should hopefully know better but if no one has complained and might even see the fact that they got to see an octopus on a dive due to the actions of some DM's as a positive thing. TLDR people often don't question the ethics of animal interaction unless they are educated on the issue."
scuba,34yd52,eanx100,2,Tue May 5 22:09:28 2015 UTC,are they only taking action because this particularly bad example is getting widespread attention?    pretty much. welcome to the viral media effect.

The other posters here talking rainbows and lollipops about taking their toddlers into a pool on compressed air may have gotten away with it, but it is seriously dangerous. The shallow end is deep enough for a lung injury and you don't want to do that to your kid.  Stick with a snorkel and mask."
scuba,354aq4,CanadianDiver,11,Thu May 7 01:13:48 2015 UTC,"IF YOU VALUE YOUR FREEDOM AND YOUR CHILDS WELLBEING TAKE THEM TO CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR!  If you were prepared to take someone underwater for the first time you wouldn't be asking  novice questions which show your own doubts about knowing how to handle a first time diver in the water.  Death in a pool is not impossible.  Now back to my original post:  First, your child needs to be 8 to do a bubble makers program or 10 to earn their junior open water certification.  Once they are old enough it is your responsibility to gauge whether they are mature enough to undertake a class where they will learn from a stranger how to survive in an alien environment.  Go have a chat at your local dive shop and get a feel for whether the instructors seem like good people.  Most scuba instructors are in it because they love diving/teaching and would be great with your child.  Some shops however are focused on making money in the quickest way possible.  It's best to avoid these shops which are often times located in tourists destinations.  Finally, if you can think of a way to make someone negatively buoyant without changing the amount of water they displace or their weight, then you are well on your way to becoming famous.  Remember that any halfway decent instructor will have far more knowledge/experience with diving than you do and is just as invested in making sure they bring everyone back breathing.    Edit:  I'll provide you some additional information about weighting since you seemed concerned about it.  I would give my divers approx. 10% of their body weight to keep them down in a full 3mm in the ocean.   If you can pick up your child normally than the extra lead won't be a problem unless he/she is absurdly overweighted.  However, the 20 lb tank on their back plus the drag of the equipment in the water would make it nearly impossible for someone to simply yank a geared up diver straight out of the water (although bringing them to their feet is very easy with cooperation and the bubble makers program only takes place in confined water (I.e. a pool.)  But again, fear not!  If scuba diving is an activity that you two are interested in then give it a try when the time comes.  As long as you listen and follow some basic rules I strongly believe you are at more risk driving down the street than scuba diving.  The instructor has a very vested interest in making sure everyone is safe.  Any problem in scuba diving can be quickly addressed by someone who is prepared both mentally and physically.  Let me know if you have any other questions!"

scuba,354aq4,Superflybriguy,3,Thu May 7 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"The doom and gloom is warranted, if you start going into 8ft of water you are dealing with 1.25 factor of expansion, 16 ft you are at 1.5 factor of expansion. It's not a concern how deep you intend to go for now, it's a concern of how deep you may decide to try later with someone who hasn't been required to read about the dangers for themselves. Children's lungs haven't been researched when it comes to diving since it would be unethical and if you decide to try 8ft that 1.25 expansion may be enough to cause even mild injury that will be with them for the rest of their lives. There is a big difference between the casual observations here and the empirical observations done be people with the proper knowledge to understand the results."
scuba,354aq4,wolfgangmob,0,Thu May 7 06:29:04 2015 UTC,Had my son on bottom of an 8 foot pool for 3 minutes at 5yrs. Use your best judgment.
scuba,354aq4,Spoiledrecluse,-9,Thu May 7 00:37:22 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, I went to Walmart and bought one of their above-ground pools.  Maybe 3, 4 feet deep...max.  I put one of my tanks in the pool with a reg on a 7' hose.  My kids would spend HOURS blowing bubbles and exploring every single nook and cranny of that thing.  I live in Michigan, and they would come out of the water with blue lips but you'd have thought they just discovered a vast underwater treasure.  At the time, they were 7 and 4 years old.  Fast forward to last month...I just had one of my best dive experiences ever with my 10 y.o. boy.  Dove Ft Pickens, spent 1/2 hour at ~ 40 feet, saw all kinds of cool stuff, and the look on his face after...well, I was a happy dad.  Long story short: in my professional opinion, the absolute WORST thing you can do with kids around 10 years old wrt to scuba is enroll them in a formal course.  It becomes too much like school and homework.  The person instructing them is NOT you and the sport, itself, becomes too rigid.  You pick the conditions that you believe are safe, dive well within recreational limits up to around 40 feet, and keep the fun in the sport.  Let them explore, let them bump into stuff under water, let them get pinched by hermit crabs, and let them be kids.  I will not formally instruct my kids until we've had a blast discovering the sport together.  There's no need to get them certified, but there are countless opportunities to get them positively hooked on the sport for life."

scuba,354aq4,stds9tng,3,Fri May 8 00:33:37 2015 UTC,I've seen new divers go from calm to bolting for the surface in a fraction of a second. I've seen people spit out their regulators when task loaded and not even notice until they try to breathe. I've seen students stop breathing for no reason- even with a regulator in. I've seen them mix up the inflator and deflator at depth and try to fix it by pressing harder.  If you're not used to training people you could easily miss the signs and get someone hurt.  If you didn't want our opinions- then why bother asking in the first place?
scuba,354aq4,stds9tng,0,Fri May 8 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"I do want your opinions but the rather long winded person telling me if I value my freedom like I should be in jail or something was ridiculous. My son wouldn't be ready for anything not requiring simply standing up, I was just asking for ideas to make the probably 10 minute exercise funner for him and all I got except for a couple  honest souls was magnanimous assumptions and certification pushes. There are shills on here I am betting. I am a highly educated, safety conscious, and a rational person."

scuba,34zcl8,jonjondt,2,Wed May 6 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"Some of this may change based on feedback from you guys, but currently the app uses a token system. You can spend tokens to remove ads, see more people in your area, save messages (they currently expire 48 hours after being read, and add more than one profile pic. Basically things that eventually cost us more money server side, cost tokens. The subscription plans give you infinite tokens so you can buy whatever you want. The idea was to let you use the app your way. If you aren't inclined to pay upfront you can just buy a few tokens to pay for features you care about. If you'd rather not deal with that, you can just pay upfront for everything. Or if you can't afford to pay at all the app is fully functional without it.  In our experience, most people that sign up for beta testing don't give any feedback. That's fine, just having people use the system gives us other information like how much strain the servers are under, etc. But typically a few people really get into it and write feedback, give suggestions etc. We felt like those people deserve an extra reward."

We found an octopus that had left a giant pile of conch shells around its home (which I thought was hilarious -- like a teenager stacking empty pizza boxes outside its door).  The DM pulled the empty shells away from the rocks to find the octopus, then started tapping at it with his carabiner to come out. At one point, the creature grabbed the carabiner and got a solid grip on the DM's wrist.  As a result, I saw an octopus for the first time. Hooray. Would be a much better memory had I seen the shells, known there was an octopus hiding inside, chuckled into my reg and carried on."

The whale sharks off Isla Mujeres are a very good experience. The last time I went there were upwards of 50+ whale sharks;   They were full-sized  Make sure you go with an actual licensed operator as opposed to someone doing a black market tour.   It will be less shady, they should have proper safety gear and a sea worthy boat (not a converted glass bottom with a shitty engine).  All the tours are more or less the same price since that is government related.  The last few years (since I have been going) it's been very busy with lots of boats/tourists. Almost like a zoo.  I heard a rumor that they may be cutting down on the number of permits/boats that can go out this year but it is Mexico..  I've only went in August which is usually a very good month.  Also when planning it, I've always been told you're likely to see more and and have a better chance around the full moon.  Some of the downsides, it's very busy. Lots of boats everywhere and you are out in open ocean so if you get sea sick at all make you take medication beforehand. It can be rough offshore. You can only snorkel with them but honestly, they're all on the surface anyway.  Positives.. Potential of whalesharks everywhere, the water off Isla Mujeres is usually less murky than Holbox.    The last couple years we have also seen Manta Rays on the same trip.  You've very close to Cancun so it can be done as half day trip. Coming from Playa del Carmen or Cozumel, it will be an all day trip but still worth it.  I'd also recommend staying in Isla Mujeres for a night or two if you can.  When all the Cancuners leave, it's a really nice little island."
scuba,34to8e,macado,3,Mon May 4 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"I went on the trip in august in 2013, can only agree with /u/macado that this was a very good experience. Loads and loads of whale sharks, plus a few manta rays. I brought my wet suit, so I didn't have to wear the regular vest. Of course this was not so I could dive below the magnificent sharks, but just for my own comfortability and movement. It was a great experience even though there were many other boats out. Our guides was very observant of the tourists to respect the animals, if somebody got a little to close, they would tell them to get the f*** up until they learned respect. Also we only went in one at a time from the boat, so the water wouldn't be crowded in anyway.  TL;DR Great experience, can only recommend!"
scuba,34to8e,CPTRetardo,3,Mon May 4 15:13:58 2015 UTC,Yes.. I forgot to mention that. Most dive operators will only let one or two people in at time so that they don't crowd the water.  It's a good idea.   You'll basically rotate in groups so everyone gets a chance.

I think it was an interesting experience.....I definitely would not do it again, or recommend it to any of my friends.  It was pretty sad to see so many whale sharks, with an insane amount of boats corralling the sharks while dropping bodies practically on top of them as they were eating.  As a result of these ""tours"" the whale sharks are actually becoming less abundant each year to that part of Mexico.  Being there and seeing what I was funding left my and my gf pretty sad.  It would have been much more incredible to one swimming naturally while on a scuba dive.  IMO: Go diving in Cozumel and enjoy the wildlife in a more peaceful manner."
scuba,34to8e,KennyS1134,2,Mon May 4 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this 100 percent. It was a once in a lifetime experience but if I had known what it was going to be like in regards to the hundreds of boats I would not have supported it by going. I think that a few people, dropped off by boat near a whale shark would probably not effect it in the least. The thing you have to understand is the magnitude though. Hundreds of people, hundreds of boats it is noisy and chaotic.  These animals feed on blooms of zooplankton. The boats target the plankton blooms leaving the Sharks no choice but to try to feed amongst masses of boats and people. I don't think that Dolphins, seals, or any other living organism would enjoy being barraged in that way. In fact doing something like this but with marine mammals would be illegal."

scuba,34to8e,daverb,3,Mon May 4 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"I did it in 2013 ~ August. It was absolutely amazing, a must do.    There were dozens and dozens of adult whale sharks. We saw a single Manta ray. I've seen videos with huge groups of mantas as well.    There were a lot of boats in the area, but the sharks were EVERYWHERE. Once in the water we only saw our group (2 people at a time) and our boat guide in the water. Everyone else was spread out because the sharks were everywhere, no reason to all crowd up.    If you want more than just sharks I recommend Captain Tony. he is incredibly friendly, but has a less legit boat. BUT, after the sharks you go to isla contoy (amazing little island) and have a full on BBQ after you lounge around on a perfect beach.

scuba,34to8e,daverb,2,Mon May 4 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"Mexican law, at least for these tours.  In general though, at least for Isla Mujujeres and Holbox, the whale sharks are on the surface feeding anyway making scuba unnecessary.    I'm sure there is some fear that bubbles which arguably do make lots of noise would scare them like they do other species or even allow people to harass them underwater.  If a whale shark really wants to get away from you they can go down...    You can still free dive with them."

scuba,34to8e,AnthroFieldSchool,1 point,Mon May 4 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"No idea, it's regulated, it's the law. Perhaps the bubbles upset the sharks so snorkelling is a compromise.. allows us to see them without upsetting the sharks."
scuba,34to8e,Mapchick,1 point,Mon May 4 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"The information that I got on our trip is that are a couple of reasons:   They're constantly moving, and even though they're enormous they're not exactly slow (which I can vouch for), so if you were diving, you'd get a single pass, and they'd be gone.  Snorkeling is much more conducive to being able to swim (as fast as you can usually) along with them for a bit, and then back on the boat to reposition and hop in again. There's something about diving, the bubbles, and disrupting both the sharks and the food source that makes it a Bad Thing(TM)."
scuba,34to8e,William_Harzia,1 point,Tue May 5 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"On my trip to Cozumel about 6 years ago we took a day trip flight to Holbox to snorkel with the whale sharks there.  I know this is a different location, but I hope I can help.  It was an unforgettable experience, but I still left feeling somewhat disappointed.    The Shark that our boat followed (each shark can be followed by two boats and boats usually stay with the same one all your) was a juvenile and ""only"" ~35' long while other tour boats were swimming with 60' sharks.  This isn't a big deal for me, but I did feel a little bit slighted while there that the sheer number of boats in the area had forced us onto a smaller animal and we didn't get the experience of seeing a big one up close.     Additionally the water was ultra murky and you couldn't see much beyond about 10-15' meaning you had trouble tracking where the shark was going to come into view and once along side you might struggle to stay with the shark without getting too close for safety or too far to even see it.  You also could not take in the overall size of the animal.  We visited in June, not sure if the water is clearer at other times.    Finally, the way that the boats dumped people in the water 2 at a time and had you swim frantically along side the shark was neither relaxing or comfortable for the tourists or the shark.  Keeping up with the shark was out of the question for most swimmers and having the shark coming straight at people out of the murky water really bothered some of the people we were sharing the boat with.    I'm really glad to say I've had the experience and it was neat to see that animal up close, but if I was to choose again I definitely would've stayed at the resort in Cozumel that day and spent the money on a handful more of boat dives on Palancar Reef."
scuba,34vy3m,InfoFlyBy,3,Tue May 5 00:27:57 2015 UTC,I personally use a gopro at the end of a stick but then i film with the gopro upside down. You can flip in in the camera itself or in post production. The reason why is because since the gopro is the lowest point its less susceptible to shaking trying to keep it upright. Having it on a pole also allows you to get the camera closer to the subject without spooking it. Hope this helps!

Essentially it would be a pole, with a pistol-style grip and a second a shorty handle mid-way down the length of the pole to provide rotational and anti-shake stability during panning shots.  I just need a way to make it very non-bulky so i can still somewhat use it like a regular pole, too."

Actually not much better than Jamaica.   And the dive shops were horrible.  They were the embodiment of the worst stereotype of cheap Dutchmen.  Crowded cattle boats with ill trained dive masters.  I saw 18 on a dive boat with one dive master. Not even an instructor. A dive master.

I can't comment on any organized dive trips they do, since we used rental pickup trucks to do shore dives at our own leisure. I recommend at least a shorty wetsuit, as diving in Speedos gets cold when you do several dives per day. Also booties would be very welcome for some beach entries - the sand can get very hot and there are sharp rocks in the surf some places."

I think experiences can vary very differently based on what you choose to do and where you stay.  We stayed at the Bahia Lagun for 11 days for some work.  Signed out tanks when we needed them from the apartment complex. Wasn't a resort type place, very nice, not too many people around.  Dove a bunch of beaches, Porto Marie being the favorite.  My DSO and one guy on our dive safety board claim its their fav. tropical water dive. I find it surprising that the comment above thinks Cayman etc are way better.  The corals in Curacao are probably the top of the Caribbean as far as health.  Of course it depends where you go around the island.  One popular dive site had a terrible bleaching event and never recovered. The amount of fishing going on is pretty obvious by the amount of fish seen but we still saw grouper, barracuda, the whole mix etc.  Also saw a video on here a couple months back where a couple divers met some dolphins though Im not sure where they were diving. Lots of large gorgonians and elk and stag horn coral. Also we saw a bunch of turtles.  If you're interested I have sketches of all the shore dives and maps and way too much data all together really..  The biggest downside of the island really is the oil refinery, hopefully you're staying somewhere on the north-west part of the island.  The smell is noxious and heinous tbh but you won't notice it unless you're in or close to Willemstad. We covered about 85% of the island by car doing science so if you have any questions I might have an answer."

scuba,34ubui,joao_franco,1 point,Mon May 4 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"Can anyone recommend a school? I've completed Advanced, Rescue, O2, a few other things   You've never worked as a DM but you want to skip over that step and jump right into instructing?  A word of advice from an IDC Staff instructor:  You're probably not as good as you think you are. For every instructor candidate I see- maybe 1 in 20 is actually as good as they think they are. The ones that skip working as a DM entirely have awful instincts and are woefully unqualified to handle a challenging class. You might pass the IE- it's really not that hard- but the first time a student gets away from you you're going to regret not having spent more time working with an experienced instructor.   I want to get certified as a instructor as soon as possible so I can start working somewhere.   Why do you feel you're qualified to teach scuba? Malcolm Gladwell argues it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery of a skill. Do you have even 1/10th of that much time invested in scuba?  If a student asks you for guidance on the best places to dive in the world- can you provide them with an honest assessment of the pros and cons of places like Indonesia/Florida/Belize/Hawaii/wherever?  Have you been diving with a jacket style BCD, back inflate style, backplate and wing, and a sidemount rig enough that you can answer questions about them?  Have you used regulators from a variety of manufacturers and can talk comfortably about the pros and cons of each?  Finally- why do you want to be an instructor?  It's not easy- it's a lot of paperwork and can make you start to hate diving. To be an instructor- you need to love teaching first and foremost. Loving diving is not enough- if you don't love teaching- you're just going to end up hating diving.  Your student's lives are in your hands and that can be incredibly stressful.  Instructing is a flooded market. Unless you have a position lined up already, or speak several languages- it can be hard to even find a position. If you do find a position- it's probably not going to pay very well. You can make a living off it in some parts of the world- but it's not a very good living. Unless you just love teaching- you'll end up miserable.  Something like 80% of instructors stop teaching after a couple of years."
scuba,34ubui,stds9tng,1 point,Mon May 4 18:53:44 2015 UTC,So what do you recommend I do if I want a job in scuba diving? I was only seeking to become an instructor because I was told that was the best way to gain employment.
scuba,34ubui,tingwong,1 point,Mon May 4 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"Get a real day job that pays well.  Dive locally often.  Go on 3 scuba trips each year.  Scuba diving pays shit, unless you're that 1 in 500 who works really, really hard and gets a bit lucky and runs a shop in a place that gets popular and has low expenses and good margins."
scuba,34ubui,stds9tng,1 point,Mon May 4 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"So what do you recommend I do if I want a job in scuba diving?   Do you actually want a job teaching diving? Or do you just want a job where you can go diving? You said you're looking for something to do for a couple of years and then move on- and that doesn't sound like someone who is passionate about teaching and diving.  Where do you want to do this for a living? Are you looking to live in SEA for a couple of years? If so- then you can eke out a living teaching scuba. That said- getting a job in the area without being able to speak multiple languages is rough. Everywhere else- you generally need two jobs. Most of the instructors I know teach scuba during the day and bar tend at night or something similar.   I was only seeking to become an instructor because I was told that was the best way to gain employment.   Again- how do you view scuba employment?  Even as an instructor you're going to be carrying tanks, helping prepare and then clean up the boat(s), and dealing with a lot of paperwork. You're going to spend 50% of your time in the pool not diving much at all. You're going to see the same area over and over and over and over- to the point where you're absolutely sick of it. As I said before- if you don't absolutely love TEACHING- scuba instructing will make you hate scuba.  So again- what do you hope to gain from this? Is it just something to do while you figure out what you want to do with your life? Are you truly passionate about diving, and more importantly, teaching?  How much experience do you have? Number of dives? Conditions (warm, cold, drysuit)? Types of diving (reef, wreck, shallow, deep)? etc.  Ask yourself this simple question- would you feel comfortable having someone with so few dives and so little experience teaching a family member or significant other?  Don't get me wrong- I LOVE teaching scuba- but I love teaching in general. I knew what I was getting into. I just want to make sure you are completely aware of what you're getting yourself into.  Having said all that- if you still think you're interested- then there are plenty of good places you can do your IDC. I don't do a ton of diving on the west coast so I'll leave that to others to answer- but just understand that the total cost of an IDC (including books, exams, and so on) is just about $3k."

scuba,34ubui,DoYouReallyCare,1 point,Tue May 5 00:11:26 2015 UTC,"I would think long and hard about making scuba a career, it's an over saturated field.   You should speak 2 or 3 languages prior if you plan to instruct outside of the USA.  The probability of you being able to make an living instructing scuba diving is very low.  Having said that Thailand is the place to get trained up cheaply.   You might also be able to do in around Bali.  You will be living the dream if you get a job, but you will always be broke.

scuba,34toru,Reedger,1 point,Mon May 4 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"Cenote:       A cenote (English: /sɨˈnoʊtiː/ or /sɛˈnoʊteɪ/; Spanish: [seˈnote]; plural: cenotes; from Yucatec Maya dzonot or ts'onot,  ""well"" ) is a natural pit, or sinkhole, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. The term derives from a word used by the low-land Yucatec Maya — ts'onot — to refer to any location with accessible groundwater. Cenotes are common geological forms in low latitude regions, particularly on islands, coastlines, and platforms with young post-Paleozoic limestones that have little soil development.

It is full tech oriented shop run by some ""famous"" divers. Should have excellent training on Asian standards.   If you are in Manila, go to Puerto Galera (more party) or Anilao (more family). Easy no current reef dives and variety diving sites. Asia divers was a good shop and the training director is good.   IMO avoid:   Moalboal - repetitive wall diving and lots of current.

That's the standard price, and you usually get good discounts when buying in off-season directly in Cairns. Once you include the flights, which are cheap to Cairns from within Australia, you would struggle to pay much less for a similar number of dives anywhere in Indonesia. (E.g.: I checked the rates for Sipadan Kapalai. You'd pay the same $700 for a 3 day package with diving, but you first need to get there)  Crowded is not something I associate with diving in Australia, at least as long as you stay away from the day cattle boats in Cairns (I'm looking at you, Quicksilver)."

The island basically speaks English in addition to spanish.   I loved working as a DM and diving. However you should realize that the way the lifestyle, job prospects, and competition works you basically will work 6 days a week if you are lucky. Usually you will have one day off a month if you have regular work. You will dive three times a day and then be asked to do a night dive right after you have unloaded a boat for the 3rd time. And this will be repeated every day.   Regardless of where you go, I would recommend getting your DM somewhere small where your work makes a difference rather than a large DM factory. And try to get some kind of hobby after work that does not involve drinking everyday. It's a slippery slope."

ENT told me I could get surgery to fix, but as it really doesn't effect me I declined and he agreed. I've been diving for over 3 years now, and haven't had one infection. I  try to wash out my ear with isopropyl alcohol after I dive.    As far as descending, it actually makes it a heck of a lot easier, as I only have to worry about equalizing one ear.   Anyway, you should probably see an ENT to be sure, as your perforation could be on the larger side."

scuba,34n8z5,Zabren,3,Sat May 2 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"Everywhere I have been to dive has realized that your vacation is just that. Yours.  You should be able to book a week at a dive ""resort"" and just do your thing. I just went to Cozumel for a week in march on a package that included 4 days of diving, a night dive, meals, all that. I was there for 7 days, dives went out every day, and I could join them or not.   I don't know much about the Jewish faith.

scuba,34n8z5,-hh,1 point,Sat May 2 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"This is a good point ... airfare from Europe (Israel) to the Caribbean is a real killer - - not only is the Red Sea in the OP's back yard, but they're also halfway to the Indo-Pacific.  The Caribbean is popular for Americans because it is close, easy & cheap in comparison to other parts of the world.    If I were located in Israel, I'd at least price out the Maldives and Seychelles as well as probably a couple of Pacific places like Palau.    For the Caribbean, if you're not gonzo-crazy to pack in as many dives as possible, a very civilized place to chill is Pirate's Point on Little Cayman (a quite small, safe & secure island).  Its also a quite small operation (just over a dozen? rooms) and the owner is a retired chef, so I'm sure that with prior arrangements, the OP's dietary restrictions could be accomodated."

scuba,34n8z5,suischarlie,2,Sat May 2 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"Red Sea diving is really nice.   You could do it from Eilat or Aqaba (1/2 the price of Eilat if the security situation is ok).  The Red Sea is better the farther south you go so Sharm El Sheik or Marsa Alam are better, but that might not work for you because of the security situation right now.  Cozumel/Cancun is farther away but there are also non-diving things to do.   I believe there is even a synagoge in Cozumel.   It also is very inexpensive, especially if you get a diving + hotel package.  Most places in the world packages aren't a good deal, but in Cozumel packages can often save you some money so they're worth looking at.  Bonaire is very inexpensive because usually you rent an apartment and do your own cooking.   You also hire a car and rent tanks from one of the shops and shore dive on your schedule.   There aren't a lot of non-diving activities on Bonaire.  It's a desert island.  I think last time I went to Bonaire with some friends it was about 750 USD per person for a week for food, apartment, care hire, and tanks -- basically everything but airfare."

There is a c-47 plane wreck there at about 22m that is nice.   Also there are non-diving things do in the area like go to Oludeniz/Fethiye or Olympos.  Security in this part of Turkey shouldn't be a problem for you.  If you're looking for a trip later in the year, the Similan Islands (near Phuket) in Thailand are nice.  The best way to do them is a liveaboard since they are so far from shore, but you could do a 4 day liveaboard then do some other things in Thailand.

scuba,34n0oy,texasguy911,-1,Sun May 3 06:13:43 2015 UTC,The sidemount bcds are badly designed and overpriced.   In order to be good you need to heavily mod them.   Its like if you told an OW with 50 dives what sidemount was and told him to design a bcd but he'd never actually dived sm or even seen someone else dive it.  The lights are bad quality.   My team bought some.  About 70% failed in < 30 dives.   Hollis took 4 months to replace them.   Of the replacements about 50% failed in < 30 dives.  Hollis took 3 months to replace them.   We got tired of that shit and sold them on ebay.

Hollis originally used re-branded Light Money lights which were great but they basically ripped off that design and brought the production in-house.  Disagree on their sidemount rigs.

scuba,34n0oy,eanx100,0,Mon May 4 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"I was at the lake last weekend and saw a shop with all brand new Hollis kit. One of them was walking up and their BP/W just totally separate. Saw the tank move a little and figured it was falling, but in fact the whole wing came off the BP. Not sure what it was - probably user error, but still amusing."
scuba,34n0oy,doombuggy110,2,Sat May 2 22:38:35 2015 UTC,Likely he didn't check the hardware holding the wing and plate together and likely single tank adapter.  Could happen to any bpw setup if you don't check over your gear.  I will say I have a hollis 38lx wing and the holes don't perfectly line up so it was a small bit of a hassle to put together but otherwise its like any other wing and I haven't had a problem with it.
scuba,34n0oy,pinch-n-roll,0,Sun May 3 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like I said, I have no idea if it was him being silly or the kit being bad - I think I heard him say something about rusted hardware.

scuba,34n0oy,doombuggy110,0,Sun May 3 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"Not much you can do to really screw up a BP/W... They ARE just a few parts.   Oh, on the contrary:  there's a lot more parts because of the whole 'feature' of being able to reconfigure them from singles to doubles and change the gas bag.   There's a whole bunch of fasteners (bolts/washers/nuts) which simply don't exist on the classical ""Rec"" BCD.    So not only can it fall apart (as seen) if these various bolts were  forgotten (user error), but they can also work lose & fall apart if they weren't assembled & torqued down correctly (another user error).    The net result is a design approach that's less reliable (even despite higher maintenance) because of a higher parts count.  -hh"
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,2,Sun May 3 11:43:55 2015 UTC,"The net result is less reliable? That's crazy talk.  Obviously a Hogarthian setup isn't for everyone or every situation but it is the most reliable system out there.  The one-piece harness eliminates more than ""a whole bunch"" of weak points; stiching, PLASTIC alligator clips, and more thin webbing and stitching all over.   There's a whole bunch of fasteners (bolts/washers/nuts) which simply don't exist on the classical ""Rec"" BCD.    My bp/w has 2 screws, 4 washers, and 2 wingnuts. -There are some 'rec' bc's that have screw and metal fasteners If you're more than a halfwit you'll predive check all your gear. It depends on setup, but for singles my cam bands go through my wing and backplate, so even if the marine grade stainless steel hardware I use manages to disappear there's a lot of torque holding my kit together."
scuba,34n0oy,pinch-n-roll,0,Mon May 4 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"The net result is less reliable? That's crazy talk   It is ""Parts Count 101"", applied to those elments which are ""touch labor"" service items for the end user because the risk of human error failure is generally much larger than mechanical failure.    The one-piece harness eliminates more than ""a whole bunch"" of weak points; stiching, PLASTIC alligator clips, and more thin webbing and stitching all over.   True enough, but all bladders have stitching, so that failure point is a wash.  Similarly, items which are prefabbed into non-user-servicable elements have avoided the risks of human error in assembly/disassembly.    Oh, and PLASTIC?   That the stuff is ""evil"" and to be avoided at all costs is yet another diving myth.  Instead, I invite you to apply GIII's old  ""chasing unseen demons"" aspect to this and think about this from a pragamatic observational standpoint: just how often do they actually fail?  How many of those ""evil"" plastic Quick Disconnects have you personally ever seen break on a dive?  No, not out in the parking lot because they ran it over with their truck, or slammed a trunk lid on it...failed on an actual dive.   YMMV, but I've observed zero for entire boatloads of divers.  In any event, even if they do fail, there's also other gear trade-off considerations here too:   the lack of a QD is not a downside risk factor when in a serious cave overhead (eg, WKPP), because not being able to rapidly ditch one's gear rapidly will rarely make any difference in anything.  But there are cases in OW diving where it can - - an example I can recall is an openwater recovery in lively conditions with small RIBs where the boat's prop was purposefully never disengaged...the SOP was to grab on and not let go during the gear doffing because the driver may need to suddenly gun it to drag you & the boat away from cliffs.  Doffing was much faster & safer with shoulder QD's present.  All in all, these are just more examples of why I say that all gear has trade-offs, and that it is important to know the pros/cons of each element of your gear, rather than to assume a ""once and done"" for risk assessment, particularly as evironmental contexts vary."
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,2,Mon May 4 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"I wasn't arguing that there aren't trade offs and pros/cons to each type.  The point was that the bp/w itself is just as reliable as any other bc. Metal isn't indestructible but plastic is more susceptible to damage overtime.  I've seen one plastic clip fail, and one other fail where the webbing slipped out of the keeper while a diver was getting out of the water, neither a catastrophic event.  Regardless almost any BC is good for diving and safe to use 99.9% of the time as long as you take care of your gear. Also gear is so reliable these days it failing is almost never the cause of any emergency.  From practice I know I can ditch my BC quickly by myself, the major downside I'm aware of for one piece harness is if you have an injured or unconscious diver you most likely need to cut them out and that takes precious time."
scuba,34n0oy,pinch-n-roll,1 point,Tue May 5 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"I wasn't arguing that there aren't trade offs and pros/cons to each type. The point was that the bp/w itself is just as reliable as any other bc.    Understood, but the claim had just been ""MOST reliable"", not ""just as"".     The human is the weak link in overall system reliability, which is why I called out the parts count of the bolts/nuts/washers in that ""DIY"" (touch labor) aspect of the BP/W design.      Metal isn't indestructible but plastic is more susceptible to damage overtime.    Its another trade.  Plastics will fail typically through UV exposure making them brittle & break, whereas metals can be more insidious because of corrosion from saltwater causing them to weaken.    FWIW, the only place where I've really seen plastic parts literally get worn out have been on the teeth of plastic weight belt buckles on resort gear...but this is really a human error of sorts once again because it is easily detected (or inspected for) and weight belt buckles are dirt cheap to replace.         Also gear is so reliable these days it failing is almost never the cause of any emergency.   Agreed, although we've already seen volunteered in this thread an observance of a BP/W falling apart, invariably from a human assembly error.     From practice I know I can ditch my BC quickly by myself,...   It does take some practice as well as flexibility.  There's an inherent trade space with the ""one piece"" loop setup in that the more snugged down it is, the harder it then becomes to doff/don...the variable is usually time, although I'll also note that sea state (wave size) is also a factor, as it is a lot easier when in dead flat water at a lake/quarry/spring than in more lively conditions.     ...the major downside I'm aware of for one piece harness is if you have an injured or unconscious diver you most likely need to cut them out and that takes precious time.   Quite true, and that operation needs a tool (knife).  QR's are both faster and require no tools...and since as we've just noted that failures are extremely rare, they're nowhere as big of a ""problem"" reliability-wise as has been so often claimed.      -hh"
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,1 point,Tue May 5 11:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah...this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it's Hollis.  It's user error, improper BP/W setup by diver which can happen with ANY brand.   If it were a set of doubles he most likely did it not have it screwed into tank bands correctly or if it were single tank, the cam bands may not have been threaded through the wing, didnt mount single tank adapter correctly or he wasnt using sex bolts.  I'm by no means a Hollis fan boy but they do make some good stuff. It can be hit or miss on some things though.    Their masks work extremely well (although they're probably just rebranded from another OEM, their F1s are some of the best fins for coldwater/drysuit diving.     Their wings are perfectly fine but then again all it really needs to do is hold air.  A backplate is a piece of metal so there is not much that can go wrong there.  Their basic computers DG02 and DG03 are great, they're the same as Oceanic models but with different algorithms.   Their VR3 computer is crap but it's a technology they bought/licensed.  Their rebreather (Prism2) has one of the best designed scrubbers and work of breathing on the market although part of this reason was it was based off the original Steam Machine Prism rebreather (Peter Ready's Incredible Steam Machine) which is a technology they licensed.  Their sidemount systems SMS100 and SMS50 are excellent and used by many people  That being said, I've never had good luck with their lights.  Their LED5 lights are easily flooded and my Hollis LED15 can light has had to be repaired twice.  I try to stay way from their lights at this point.  Their Hollis Explorer rebreather is a piece of shit..  I have seen more fail on surface than actually function correctly.  Like I said, hit or miss on somethings but overall they do make some decent stuf."
scuba,34n0oy,macado,2,Mon May 4 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'll reiterate that I don't think that it's Hollis' fault that his bc. I just thought it was amusing that they were all hollis fan boys and were talking down our stuff and theirs disintegrated.   I used to have the LED25. Good size, pretty good output. But I decided I wanted a Focus instead. Looking at their sidemount system, but I'm honestly extremely pleased with my scubapro. Otherwise I'd probably grab the hollis or the nomad. I think they make just fine stuff on average. I would say scubapro makes great regs and a great sidemount system but not much else that I'm totally enthralled with. Maybe nova fins and jets. And that new Nova 700 light...  Every company has good and bad. I'm not one to say that any company is all great or should totally be avoided."

scuba,34n0oy,butterbal1,4,Sat May 2 18:21:56 2015 UTC,It takes about an hour in the pool to get familiar with a backplate and wing and they really do make for a much better dive experience.  Underwater they really do feel more comfortable and instantly gone is that squeezed feeling at the surface.    I beg of you to try doing a couple dives with one before buying a jacket style BCD.

I am reading over his history and see he owns one and seems to like it.   /u/CanadianDiver There is a lot of misinterpretation on the whole BP/W idea. Myself I prefer it now, knowing what I do and do recommend it be given consideration by a new diver. The whole point was that they are not exclusive to technical diving. I also state that there are lots of good choices for traditional BCD's as well, but that seems to be lost in the noise. My position is not anti-'anything but a back plate' but rather, consider carefully what you are buying and avoid the crap. I do suggest back inflate over jacket for the simple reason that it aids in a diver having better trim in the water.   For the record I agree with him.  They are not the only option but I do enjoy using them over jacket style BCDs in my diving."
scuba,34n0oy,twerky_stark,1 point,Mon May 4 02:34:53 2015 UTC,I was thinking of his story where the group drifted on the surface for like 2 hrs after the dive in bad weather and the guy in the bpw really had a hard time of it.

scuba,34n0oy,runsongas,0,Sat May 2 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. A back inflate BCD or BP/W set up might make you ""tip forward"" on the surface when fully inflated, but a regular ""jacket"" style BCD won't keep your face out of the water at the surface unless it's inflated.  Having recently spent a weekend doing rescue scenarios I can guarantee you can be face down unconscious at the surface in a jacket style BCD. What's more useful  in this situation is an experienced, well-trained buddy (and DM ).  One thing I love about jacket BCs is that  integrated weights are a lot more comfortable. If you're diving in cold water, make sure your releases and clips are easy to use with cold, gloved hands. Some of the cheaper BCDs seem to have fiddlier attachments that would need replacing."
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,2,Sat May 2 22:52:18 2015 UTC,don't bother arguing with hh. there's no amount of logic that would convince him to give up his irrational belief that a bp/w is dangerous and will drown you.

Just because there's something new doesn't automatically mean that is is always better (take split fins for example).     gear trends change because people choose to buy    See ""Split Fins"".  For wings, they had a period of popularity back in the 70s/80s and you can go see many examples of them in photos in old issues of Skin Diver magazine ... and if you're cynical, you'll also realize that for tropical photos with a female model in a bikini, the reason why was because they were much more ""photogenic"".    However, other than that period of T&A marketing, they fell by the wayside and Jackets took over.  The resurgence of the Wing was ~17 years ago, pretty much when GIII took over the WKPP project and discovered the Internet, triggering the entire ""DIR Strokes"" flame wars.  There's good points to the system, but there's also been a lot of poseurism ... which has been magnified by DEMA:   why do you think scubapro and aqualung offer bp/w and sidemount systems nowadays? cuz it sells.   Not quite the whole story.  A few years ago, DEMA marketing research found that ""tech"" divers spent a lot more money in dive shops than ""rec"" divers did, and as such, there's been an ongoing push to try to sell to these more profitable customers...as well as to try to push ""rec"" divers into ""tech"", to create more of these more profitable customers.  This is the business side of diving, which has little to do with if it is actually ""better"" for the customer.  FWIW, for an analogy, look at TV advertising over the past decade and how many more advertisements have been run for SUVs over normal automobiles.   The profits made on an SUV are consistently more than for a 4 door sedan (FYI, at one point it was $15K vs $800 per unit sold) - - so if you were the manufacturer of both, wouldn't you want to sell the more profitable of the two product too?     you can keep holding onto how bp/w is some death trap in your mind, ..   Sorry, you're simply trying to argue against physics, and I've done controlled tests to confirm my Engineering analysis.  The bottom line is that in some circumstances, the results are benign, but in others they can be quite bad.  Even though the anti-science religious fanatics are loath to hear that, everything is a trade-off.   but it won't change that more and more divers like diving bp/w and buy them over jackets or back inflates.   Oh, look:  its an ""Appeal to Popularity"" fallacy attempt.      As I said,  All gear has compromises. Anyone who claims otherwise is either ignorant or a liar.  -hh"
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,0,Mon May 4 10:45:38 2015 UTC,"DEMA may be pushing tec rec and all that, but at the end of the day manufacturers make equipment in order to sell it. Aqualung makes the i3 because people buy them. Nobody makes a horsecollar because they can't sell them.  Sorry, but your personal anecdotes don't count for a real scientific study. your stance on bpw is just as ridiculous as the DIR guys on snorkels."
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,1 point,Mon May 4 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense.    It is merely physics.  Divers in drysuits and twin steels (particularly with a weighted keel) are able to offset the effect because these each move their CG rearward to better align with the CB, but thin suited AL80 diving tropical divers don't have these weighting-based CG shifts and will reliably ""face dunk"" as soon as they put +10lbs of gas in the bag to minimally lift their chin clear of the water and stop kicking their legs to counteract the torque.   ... you can be face down unconscious at the surface in a jacket style BCD.    True, as a Jacket Style doesn't create a countering (rearward) torque - it merely isn't as bad.  The only system which does were the old horsecollars we used to dive in (30+ years ago).  Unfortunately, there's very vey few (if any) vendors who still sell them.   One thing I love about jacket BCs is that integrated weights are a lot more comfortable.   True too, but WI pockets are another trade-off in that for these same surface floats issues, I've found that most WI pockets on BCDs (both Jacket and Wing styles) are located too far forward...what's missing is the ability to put weights back close to one's spine.  And what this also means is that a Wing-style BCD (rather than a BP/W) combines the worst of both worlds.   -hh"
scuba,34n0oy,Acire1304,0,Sun May 3 11:38:26 2015 UTC,"Wings are a religion for some people, and criticizing them will bring down votes.  If you're definitely going to dive local cold water with twin tanks and a drysuit, then go ahead.  If not, then don't assume it's the greatest possible thing in the world:  all gear configurations have trade-offs.  Suggest some searches to see where this has been discussed before at length."
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,0,Sat May 2 22:31:27 2015 UTC,As a new diver I was looking for a jacket style mainly because of the integrated weights and that's what I got. But with a few more dives under my belt I wish I had just gone and gotten a BP/W. I find with BP/W set up I don't need any weight added at all and it's so versatile.
scuba,34n0oy,Acire1304,0,Sun May 3 06:55:18 2015 UTC,So you're knowingly diving with no ditchable weight...?

scuba,34n0oy,-hh,1 point,Mon May 4 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"it depends if you are using a wetsuit and how big your tank is. without a wetsuit that would lose lift at depth and with a small tank that only contains 6 pounds of gas or less, you can dive without ditchable weight. with proper weighting, you could swim the rig up from depth even with a bc failure. that is basically what divers in the 60s did before bc's even became a thing. maybe hh is old enough to remember diving a backpack without a bc. i would recommend carrying a smb or lift bag for emergency lift if needed though."

scuba,34n0oy,-hh,0,Tue May 5 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"maybe hh is old enough to remember diving a backpack without a bc.   Going without a BCD wasn't much of an issue in warmwater diving as one only had the ~4lb swing of the (St63) tank to manage, and  ""don't touch the reef"" didn't exist back then.     When Horsecollars came along, they were a pain in the groin (literally, due to very narrow crotch straps), and dive training very clearly emphasized putting on the weightbelt last, so as to not trap it under the crotch strap which would make it non-ditchable.    With cummerbund-based Jacket BCDs, this has become less of an issue, but it is still not a bad practice to be in...on occasion, I've noticed BP/W users who are unknowingly repeating the old horsecollar rigging mistake.  -hh"
scuba,34n0oy,eanx100,0,Mon May 4 10:01:04 2015 UTC,"To configure your system with some amount of ditchable weights was historically considered to be an absolute ""must have"", and the rationale for why still holds as valid today for Rec divers.   In a nutshell, the basis of the rationale is that the surface is your ""safety"" escape, so configurations which improve the probability of being able to successfully make such a contingency escape are desirable, and configurations which hinder this are undesirable.   Weighting enters into this under the contingency branch (""what ifs"") for when you start to go down the branches of the fault tree.  For example, a BCD failure occurs and now you're forced to have to try to ""swim up"" against your weight - -   a)  if your negative weight exceeds 100% of your swimming thrust, you sink & drown.     b) Similarly, if it only requires 50%, but because of this increase in swimming exertion, you now happen to now get a leg cramp, dropping your swimming capacity to 10%, you sink & drown.     c)  Even if it only requires 25% and you don't cramp up - - but you can only sustain this level of thrust for 30 seconds because you're OOA {EDIT:  and/or you're not in super-great shape and after a minute or two of hard exercise, you fatigue out} ... you get partway up, then your power drops off, you sink and drown.  d)  Okay, lets say you make it to the surface - - but you're there with zero positive buoyancy, which means that you now have but XX seconds to ditch that negative gear before it drags you back under...and you drown yet again.    Bottom line is that having some ditchable weight neutralizes a lot of these risks.  But there are trade-offs (of course):    First, as the dive plan goes south, one has to commit to ditching while you're still be strong enough to drop weights.  One technique which is taught to address this is to remove but hold onto the weights  - it takes far less strength to just let go.    Second, because you're relying on buoyancy to take you up to the surface without any exertion, the ascent will be less controlled and as such, might be too fast and cause other problems...but particularly for the recreational diver, DCS is vastly more survivable than drowning and is the lesser of two evils.    FWIW, not all dive plans merit having ditchable weights.  For example, if you're in a cave, there is no surface to escape to, so having that capability as a contingency doesn't improve survivability.  FWIW, this is also why a snorkel isn't of much use in a cave either -- and its absence is then a facilitator for the DIR-inspired 7ft long hose's routing strategy.     Finally, the good news is that buoyancy failures are relatively rare today.  Modern BCDs have become quite reliable and the power inflator was a godsend, because ""way back in the day"", you would have to remove your regulator (much like buddy breathing) to put any air into your BCD.  For the most part, diver fatalities which can be attributed to buoyancy failures are overwhelmingly due to two basic diver errors.  The first is what I'll call the ""mystery screw up"", where a (usually very Rec) diver is found dead on the bottom with their weights still in place.  The second are more technical divers who have committed a more basic equipment design flaw -- typically either diving wet with steels (suit compression gets them) or using a so-called ""bondage"" wing design (bungee cords) which prevented the BCD bladder from being able to fill to its full lift capacity.  For both of these latters, it had not been uncommon to hear that they had been overcoming buoyancy issues at depth on prior dives, by ""swimming up"" against their negative buoyancy - - a warning sign which was ignored.   -hh"

It gives an alternate means of inflating and deflating your BCD.  I know a number of divers, including myself, that dive them regularly and have never had an issue.  It only creates problems if diving with people unfamiliar with the i3 and you don't brief the dive and equipment beforehand.  On the plus side, it means my hands never have to leave my cummerbund if I don't want to as I can reach it with my thumb still tucked in.  It also means that I can add or release air regardless of my orientation in the water.  That said, if you don't like it, don't dive it.  But it's also not the disaster you make it out to be."

Having movable valves on the shoulders is a weak point, as is a separate hose for or inflation and manual deflation.   Also if you never move your hands from your waist then you must never signal a buddy, check your depth, air, or bottom time which I find hard to believe."

I also keep my gear streamlined so I don't get lanyards and the like tangled on anything and I'm a kelp diver and I've never had an issue with anything getting snagged or bumped.

As for someone not being able to help me, that's a stupid statement.  A proper pre-dive briefing should cover the gear too.  Here's my i3, here's my standard power inflator.  If anything I could argue that it gives me a second means of inflating my BCD for when the standard power inflator malfunctions.  Which happens about as often as an i3 malfunctions, meaning in well maintained gear, as close to never as you can get.  Wow, the hate for something new in diving is unbelievable, because there's no way anything new could possibly be an acceptable alternate."

scuba,34n0oy,doombuggy110,3,Sat May 2 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"Snagged on what?  It's pretty much flush with the bc.  Only problem is if you can't route hoses properly, which isn't exactly difficult.  They're no more complex than the vast array of different integrated weight systems that people use, if you can't trust your buddy to learn your kit you probably shouldnt dive with them"
scuba,34n0oy,doombuggy110,-1,Sun May 3 09:16:00 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, but (here comes the bs right? :)...)  Not all diving is with people you know well.  Not every person in a group will be your buddy.  Your buddy might be in trouble too, as accidents are usually compound problems manifesting in an aggregate crisis.  The lever can easily be snagged by a bungee or line.  I imagine a snagged SMB line would inflate that thing in a hurry, for example.  Most damningly, this device solves a nonexistent problem.  It introduces new factors while solving...  nothing.  JMO, I wouldn't dive with it.  I'm leaning toward tech right now though, and have an aviation background, so my mindset is leaned toward efficiency, simplicity, and risk mitigation.  I just don't like this device."
scuba,34n0oy,MasherusPrime,3,Sun May 3 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, some good points, however;  I have yet to see any evidence of people struggling to figure out how to work the inflator on someone, if there are any accounts of it is live to hear them.  Following the inflator hose from the first stage is the best way to figure t out f you're confused  Have you dived with one?  If something on your be is snagging on it, it'll be dragging on the floor as well.  It's quite difficult to snag it, as its sloped.  A reel line would also struggle to tangle, and is about as likely to tangle on it as any other part of your body - the key is deploying the dsmb safely  Finally, I would argue that it does solve a problem, giving a simpler means of deflating your bc.  Normally you have three ways to deflate, but at any one time only one will work depending on trim.  Having a single way to deflate may prevent uncontrolled ascents in newbies who struggle to find the correct means of deflating.  But, regardless, it's totally ok not to like it or recommend it.  It's just people saying its a disaster waiting to happen will set me off."
scuba,34n0oy,-hh,2,Sun May 3 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"One, check out the post at the very top. That'll help you. Other than that...  $300 is a little low, but there is a market for that price. I've got a buddy that dives that Cressi 5R or whatever that's on the link you posted. He loves it.   As for concerns of cold water, current and singles, those aren't really things you should worry about with your rig. If it was a strong current, maybe I could see suggesting you get a harness sort of rig, like a backplate/wing since they tend to be more streamlined. However, it doesn't matter that much. The big difference you can make there is not having a bunch of stuff dangling off of your BC. Cold water, only thing would be ability to adjust if you were theoretically going from warm to cold, so going from a 1mm or something to a drysuit. Almost all BCs will be for a single cylinder - you gotta pay extra for doubles and so on, and they are almost (I want to say it's 100%, but I don't know for sure) all backplate/wing or harness sorts of BCs. Your price range and conditions are exactly suited to most divers and will probably best relate to the medium-low end of most brands. You shouldn't have a problem.  BCs, I've found that if it fits you comfortably, it's good. Some companies make really amazing things like regs and computers, but if you find a BC that fits and it's not something like a ""Joe's Dive Shop"" brand that you wouldn't trust, I'm sure it's fine. Also, I know online is great, but maybe run to a dive shop to try the thing on physically to make sure it fits."

On the otherhand you need to stay afloat in the surface using the bcd. Get a BCD with enough lift.   Single bottle: Literally any BCD.  Current: Non issue with BCDs. Problem if you get really wobbly fins.   Also, you might want to consider the travel weight of your BCD. If you want to fly somewhere to dive, the weight savings are golden. Myscuba gear weights 17.6kg which leaves enough room for 5 t shirts and 2 pants.   Check used for used BCDs. People move into technical diving and sell the BCD for cheap.

scuba,34k0zo,-hh,13,Fri May 1 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"That's part of it.  The other part is that this handing wasn't an attempt to catch/kill/eat the octopus, to provide sustenance for a fisherman - - it was an intervention which was done purely for self-gratuitous entertainment.  And while some degree of intervention can be considered permissible, the question becomes when does one philosophically cross the line.   A good/simple rule of thumb is to consider how many calories it cost the target creature - - theres an order of magnitude difference between making a fish move out of your way and making it have to burn a ton of calories to metabolically processes compounds to make ink that it used while it was in what it thought was nothing less than a life-or-death situation.      To use an an automotive analogy, consider the parking lot at work and as we're walking across an aisle, a guy guns it and tries to run you over with his car.

scuba,34k0zo,Crash_Coredump,5,Fri May 1 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"First, not sure if spearfishing on OC or CC is generally accepted. Most people I know of consider it bad form to spearfish on OC/CC. Some people I know disapprove of it entirely. I'm not necessarily against spearfishing to eat, as there is generally no bycatch, and the boats I go on will throw back any out of season or too small/large catches.  I know people who spearfish and I also dive with them. I don't care for spearfishing much, to me it brings a certain kind of violence to a setting that for me is peaceful and serene. More importantly, though, is that typically I find that people with spearguns or polespears aren't sufficiently careful with their equipment, and I've been almost stabbed on several occasions by idiots who have little to no situational awareness and yet insist on spearfishing. That said, those few people I know who have good skills underwater and who are careful with their equipment are fine with me.  The other thing is that in this video we have some jackass harassing an octopus for his own amusement. What a big man -- let's harass a tiny animal for fun, right? This is a lot different from someone who spears a blackfish (or whatever) through the head, kills it instantly/quickly, and then brings it back to eat. The people I know who spearfish are respectful of the lives they take -- I don't observe anyone tormenting something before they kill it. This guy also clearly isn't fishing, and disturbing animals like this can cause them to become prey for other predators, can disrupt their behavior, make it harder for other divers to observe them and enjoy being in the water with them, and so on.  So here's another question -- people eat hamburgers all the time.  What if someone abuses a cow for his own amusement and posts a video of it? Who cares, right? Ranchers/butchers kill them all the time to eat them, so why would anyone find abusing a cow to be deplorable? Right?"

It took about 45 minutes before any sharks showed up, but once they did it blew me away. The Great White is the 14th species of shark I have dived with (though this wasnt really a dive) and most definitely worth the wait. I actually enjoyed watching the sharks from the top deck of the boat the most, you could see them most clearly then. The water is VERY cold (12 degrees Celsius, 53 Fahrenheit) and the visibility isn't good. They say it averages 1-3 meters, and we had about 1 1/2 when I went.  I chose Marine Dynamics for my trip and was VERY pleased. It is one of the largest operators and that seemed to be a good thing. Compared to the other operators, the boat is bigger and nicer, the cage is much larger (8 people at a time), the facilities on shore are larger and nicer as well. In addition, they have by far the largest emphasis on conservation, as they work very closely with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust. They are the only tour company that actually uses each tour to do research on the sharks. Each trip, they bring along a marine biologist to do some kind of data gathering, whether it be tagging the sharks, or taking pictures of their fins to log them in some sort of computer system. In addition, the staff was very professional.  The downside to that company is sometimes they do take out quite a large group as opposed to other operators, but I found the size and comfort of their boat and cage made up for it. After 20 minutes in that water, I couldn't feel my hands anyways, I was ready to get dry, haha.  If you have any questions, just let me know!"
scuba,34kt7z,solodaninja,1 point,Sat May 2 05:20:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks a lot for this info. Yes this seems quite reputable, I had found the cheapest one and then went onto trip advisor and realised they were a total scam. How big were the sharks you saw, and how many? I shall book with them in that case. On an unrelated note, we were planning on going Bungee Jumping, you didn't happen to do that in Cape Town did you? Also did you look into False Bay at all, if so what are the differences between the two sites?"
scuba,34kt7z,solodaninja,1 point,Sat May 2 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"We saw a total of 9 sharks (several paid a visit more than once) ranging from a couple babies that were under 2 meters, up to a couple that were over 4 meters. Obviously, you will most likely have a different experience. They said they average 8 different sharks each trip.  Nope, I didn't do much else in Cape Town other than a day safari (would not recommend) because I got really sick.  I am not 100% sure about the False bay/ gansbaai difference, but the impression I get is that the sharks are only at false bay for half a year, but sightings are reliable at gansbaai year round, which would be why there are way more operators there. False Bay is known for the sharks going airborne when they attack the seals, but that's only for a short time each year."
scuba,34kt7z,qwimjim,1 point,Sat May 2 10:53:58 2015 UTC,"I did the shark diving out of gansbaii, I enjoyed it. Sharks are huge. One recommendation, take anti nausea medication, there's one you take the night before and another dose the morning of. Dramamine? That sounds right. I'd say 1/4 of the boat was very ill from the boat ride and basically threw their money down the drain. A few never even got in the water. I'm someone that gets nauseous very easily, I felt 100%, those pills really work. It's not all about being in the cage, it's equally cool watching from the boat especially when the shark pops out to bite the fake seal they use to draw it in. You don't see the big open jaw underwater, only above water   We did the bungee at bloukrans bridge, if you're going to do a bungee, do that one. I think it's 3rd highest in the world and highest bridge bungee. The other two are a tower in Macau and a dam in Switzerland.   Also if you have the coin get the honeymoon cottage at storms river mouth, amazing place, waves crashing right outside your door, views right on the ocean. Nice seaside hike there too to the waterfall"
scuba,34kt7z,Caesara604,1 point,Sun May 3 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"I did the cage shark diving in Gansbaai when I lived in Cape Town a few years ago. Would recommend. Would also second another poster's recommendation to take anti-nausea meds before you head out. It can get a good chop going pretty quickly out there, and the boats will head out in anything that's not actually dangerous. I've never been nauseous on the water before, but we had a lovely light breakfast included in our dive package and I left it all in the water. Picture four of six of us lined up puking over the starboard side as they were setting up the cage on the port side and trying to get us down into the water to minimize the seasickness. That said, a little extra chum never hurt. We saw about six sharks, and they were all fearless and huge. One did about four passes of the cage, getting closer each time, until finally he shot up from the side of us and slammed himself into the cage. I have this one photo of his eye and teeth from about 12 inches away. Pretty amazing."

scuba,34h9jn,ethanjf99,8,Fri May 1 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"""peak performance buoyancy"" according to their site. Good to near perfect buoyancy is not a skill you can acquire through a course. Takes lots of time in the water, in all different conditions, in all the different gear you might wear/use.  Edit: Of course this class helped you, it's knowledge every diver should know about. It's my opinion though that it should be consider essential knowledge and taught in OW class.  Especially useful for someone pretty green and doing drysuit diving."
scuba,34h9jn,phorkor,3,Fri May 1 04:10:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't teach you perfect buoyancy, it teaches you techniques to perfect your buoyancy.   We mainly focused on proper weighting (something my ow instructor didn't teach us. he basically just threw weights at us and packed enough on so we'd all be stuck to the bottom of the platform), while I was focusing on my breathing and buoyancy the instructor was making adjustments to my trim and helping me be aware of what I was doing and what adjustments to my breathing would do, we also practiced at different depths. Started out at 30ft then ascended 3ft at a time with 2min stops at each to adjust air in the BC and again, work on breathing so we didn't ascend or descend more than a foot.   It was all actually quite informational. No, you will never leave a class with perfect buoyancy, but you take classes to practice/hone your skills. Just like after the search and recovery class, it doesn't mean you'll be a professional treasure hunter, it just means that you were taught new skills that you can practice on your own."
scuba,34h9jn,ethanjf99,2,Fri May 1 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"you're right of course, but for new divers a little extra focused practice doesn't hurt.  Not a card-collector, don't advocate for it, but if you can afford it -- why not? It sure as hell ain't gonna make your buoyancy worse. And if you live far from the ocean, like OP, getting all that time in the water is tough. Nicer to have higher-level buoyancy skills when you start."
scuba,34h9jn,phorkor,1 point,Fri May 1 12:08:27 2015 UTC,You don't even get a card for PPB. A lot of times it's part of the AOW course unless someone specifically takes it prior.
scuba,34h9jn,phatbrasil,1 point,Fri May 1 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"It's one dive in the AOW course. There's a more extensive course you can do if you want.

It's like looking something up on Google, if you don't even know what to search for, none of the answers make sense.  this course is just a couple of day to say, this is how your buoyancy is affected by  <thing>.  while not necessary, it does have its values."

If you're going to own your own and dive with it, then yes you can get your training from buddies and you don't need the cert.

Costs vary from place to place, but I think I spent around £2-3k for everything, including accommodation, course fees and later the PADI application fees. I may have overpaid but honestly it was an incredible 2 weeks.  If you're hoping to work in the EU you shouldn't need visas as a British citizen, but no doubt you want to go further, so be sure to research the country of interest and get sorted with liability insurance, (if you haven't already).

scuba,34i67g,thetafferboy,3,Fri May 1 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"First, how long have you been diving and what is your experience level?    PADI Instructor Development Course (IDC) and IE   requires 100 dives, would you want someone with that little experience teaching you?  With that being said, I've met some very good instructions that do not have a lot of dives, some people are just very good teachers.  A lot of these are hard questions to answer.  Which cert agency did you want to teach for? I'm assuming your DM was PADI?  There are other agencies to consider depending on where you'll be teaching and the shop you work for CMAS, SSI, SDI/TDI, NAUI, etc.  As a PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor (OWSI), you can pretty much teach anywhere.   They do not required you to teach through a shop. Teaching somewhere in UK would be tough to do full-time.     In tropical places like Thailand, Caribbean, Red Sea where the cost of living is cheaper you can survive on a dive instructor's salary but it is not a glamorous life style. I'd often joke that I would/could make more money working full-time at McDonalds.  A lot of these places have a high season (busy season) where you can make the majority of your money/tips. You will need to be disciplined enough to have safe enough money for low reason.    It's hard to speak on costs of IDC/IE as they vary through training programs and places in worls. Most of the Instructor Schools in Thailand and Carribean, usually include some form of dorm style housing.  Make sure you factor in money for equipment, food, housing, etc.  For example in Mexico (GoProCozumle.com), Your instructor course runs around $2800 USD. That includes accomodations, PADI IDC, IDC crew pack, and your PADI IDC and IE fees.  At Ban's Diving Reort (Big Instructor mill/school on Koh Tao) the cost is 33,900 baht ($1031).  That doesn't include any of your PADI Fees or the PADI IDC crew pack (around $500) or EFR training (required to be a PADI Instructor)  My point is depending on where you take your PADI IDC / IE, make sure to look at what it includes and doesn't include.  See if it includes IDC crew pack, your PADI IDC, IE and EFR fees, your EFR course or perhaps some PADI specialties."
scuba,34i67g,macado,3,Fri May 1 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"Your question is actually multiple questions. But, as far becoming an instructor, your real question seems to be, How to make a living as a dive instructor?? As far as what agency to teach with, for good, bad or indifferent, PADI will probably give you the most opportunities. However, TDI-SDI, SSI and even NAUI can work. (I as most instructors teach thru mult agencies). If my 20+ years working in diving, I have found no magic formula. To make it in the dive industry, you will need to be an excellent diver and instructor-but that is just the starting point. What other skill-sets do you bring to the table. Do you have a boat captains license. Are you a regulator repair tech. Do you have IT skills. How about diesel engine repair. Carpentry. Language Skills. Customer service experience. Underwater videography & editing. What skills are valued also depends on wear you want to work. The Florida Keys is a very different scuba market than the Red Sea. I am sorry this might not have answered your question, but these are the issues that surround working as a pro in scuba. IMHO. In the end, you work in scuba because it is your passion, not because you are bored with your desk job."

However these places are important to people for jobs and local economy.  They could do this by charging a larger premium and spending money on preservation. My professor/instructor has been diving for over 40 years and talks about how depressing it is to dive lots of places now because what used to be an amazing dive full of life has become grey, green, and turbid.

It is a bitter sweet situation, it ultimately brings more tourism (the damaging, polluting kind) but it also brings in cash to help fund conservation. To be honest the influx of not just tourists but people looking for work due to the tourism causes a lot of damage. Population increase in general seems to be bad. But who am I, as a reasonably privileged westerner, to say don't feed your family.  I don't know, I think a careful mix of education, careful investments and heavy regulation is the key but humans are only human so greed, excess and ultimately damage eventually takes over.

scuba,34akzl,JakeTG,2,Wed Apr 29 17:03:34 2015 UTC,Great photos! Looks like a nice place to dive.   I would recommend from personal experience using either your octopus or your vents on the main reg to inflate your SMB. Having your primary out of your mouth is not a good idea in case something goes wrong with the SMB and you need to fix it quickly.

My wife and I did 10 ocean dives with them in February and would not hesitate to use them again. They own their own small boat (which is a plus) and the crew was great.  They also offer cenote and Cozumel diving. Cenote diving I'd use them for (and will the next time I'm in the area) but if I want to dive Cozumel I'd probably just hop on the ferry and head over myself. The only real potential downside is their location. They are down at 5th avenida and 40 calle which is not close to the center of town.

But we went to this place called the ""French keys"" I believe; spectacular diving.   All the diving in T&C is at the edge where it drops off. The couple days we were there it was excellent."
scuba,34bce0,alaskanpolyglot,3,Wed Apr 29 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"*French Cay.  You don't really get to chose the sites you'll dive in the TCI.  You sign up with one of the operators and they'll you to where the best conditions are.  French Cay is fairly rare to go to due to the distance from Provo.  Dive locations fall into a few main places.  In each of these areas there are many sites.    Grace Bay.  Just off the north shore of Provo, very short (10-15min) boat ride.  Rocks at about 10ft dropping down to a sandy bottom maxing at 100 - 110ft.  Nice easy diving.  North West Point  Off the To the west of Provo, 45min ride.  Wall diving.  Fairly deep min depth (~20ft) sandy bottom, then the wall which drops fairly straight down to deeper than you can see.  Good chance of sharks (reef and the very occasional hammerhead and more occasional tiger).  West Caicos  Pretty similar to North West Point, except off a different Island.  French Cay  Long way out.  Mainly used when the other dive sites are too choppy to dive because a) it costs a lot of fuel to get a boat there and b) when the other sites are calm, French Cay can be choppy.  A mix between Gracebay and the other locations.  Generally more current.  Better chance of pelagics etc as it's further out and they like the current.  In all the dive sites there's a good chance of of seeing (in descending order of likely-hood) turtles, Eagle rays, sharks, the very occasional Manta.  If you go out a lot there's a good chance of dolphins on the surface and if you're very lucky underwater too (although in 500+ dives there I never saw one underwater).  Whale season is Jan - Feb so they're gone now.  In terms of operators - I'm a bit out of the loop now.  However Dive Provo, Turtle Divers, Big Blue and Flamingo Divers are all good.  If you're more experienced I'd recommend Flamingo divers.  It's a little more personalised and works less to a schedule than some of the others."

scuba,34baa2,stebedoni,2,Wed Apr 29 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of diving in Hawaii and I think Kauai has the best and worst diving in the islands.  The in-shore dives on Kauai are frequently sub par compared to the other islands.  Generally speaking the viz is worse, the water is colder and the density of life is less.  Mana Crack and Niihau/Lehua are the opposite, these sites are head and shoulders above the rest of Kauai and easily in the same class as some of the other top flight dives in Hawaii.    To paint you a picture: my favorite dive at Lehua is called ""Vertical Awareness"".  You drop down on a pinnacle that's off shore from Lehua.  This is in maybe 10-15m of water.  Sharks are everywhere, bigger ones than you see in shore, mostly Galapagos and Sandbar.  At first you point them out to the rest of the divers, after a while you stop bothering.  You swim off the side of the pinnacle and sort of spiral down around it, you see tons of fish, the usual suspects of course, but also things like Yellowfin Soldierfish and Tinker's Butterfly!  The water has almost no particulate and you feel like the visibility is unlimited.  You're down past 30m now and you swear you can see the bottom down at maybe 70 or 80m.  There are plenty of cracks to peek in if you want to go small, or you can swim off the pinnacle a bit and get a wider view.  After a bit the DM signals that it's time to go up a bit, so you ascend to 20-25m and, taking a compass heading, kick off the wall into pure blue ocean.  There's no visual reference so you keep a close eye on your depth and the rest of the group, but not so close that you miss the manta or the school of barracuda.  After a time you see a wall loom out of the distance, and as you get close the current starts to pick up and you spend the rest of the dive drifting along the wall of Lehua crater, listening to whalesong, hoping to see a Monk Seal."

Also make sure everyone on the boat is advanced and on nitrox so you can get at least three dives in. Great place to see some sharks and things you might not see otherwise.    All I can say is the diving is great but its more about the cool factor just like Cocos in Costa Rica or other off the path dive sites.   If you want ask for a Guy named Bronson around the dive shops, he will hook you up with all the shore diving around the island.

scuba,346fvx,duckmuffins,2,Wed Apr 29 11:30:08 2015 UTC,"Here's another fun fact about the scallop in the picture. It's referred to as a blushing scallop. You can see the meat is slightly more orange.  I find that these ones taste more sweet.  ""orange meat is caused by an excess of a natural pigment called zeaxanthin in a female scallop. As the gonad ripens and takes on an orange hue, any overabundance of this pigment is transported into the adductor muscle [the part of the scallop we eat]. Meat quality or taste is not affected, and some markets may prefer this color variation."" Unlike some shellfish that have both male and female parts in one animal, Atlantic sea scallops exist as separate males and females. Spawning occurs in July and August along much of the Maine coast, though gonads also will ripen in January and February.""  http://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/blog/blushing-scallops"

I got the GoPole bobber as a gift a year or two ago so I switched to that, the footage is ok but I can't get video as close to life as I wanted without them being startled.  Both poles were bungied to a D ring on my BCD so I could drop the camera for both hands free if ever need be.

But my gf and some of my other dive buddies started using GoPro cameras on extendable poles and the creatures that typically flee from me, just look right past the GoPro to watch the diver and don't seem to care that it 5 inches from them.  Getting in close to an eel is easy with the GoPro stick - a little dicey with my big camera rig.  Grudgingly, I have to admit that with the red filter and the stick - the GoPro gets incredible shots that are hard or impossible to get with my big-ass camera."

Sometimes its crap but it never feels like your in a fish tank, its always new and different and you work for it. That makes all the difference. UK diving is challenging, when I have had a rough dive I know I've learnt something, I'm being made into a better diver. I know I dive safer because of it.   The life is great if you give it a chance, the wrecks superb. The viz can be shit, but iff it is, congratulations you have a chance to practice your low vis best practice.   Join a club, go diving with them, learn why they like it. PM me if you want to chat."

scuba,345905,Patmarker,2,Tue Apr 28 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"I'm moving to the UK soon, after many years of warm water diving. I sincerely hope the wrecks, seals etc. make up for the otherwise appalling conditions. Also, cheap flights to more enjoyable dive locations, I suppose."
scuba,345905,FormerlyTurnipHugger,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"The conditions can be fantastic, but they can be crap too. If you wanted an easy dive then you can jump in a lake."
scuba,345905,drinkermoth,2,Tue Apr 28 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Ha, I can see why you might feel that way. I don't. I have high expectations of diving in the UK. Try a few dives when it gets warmer. Give the dives a go and if they're really not for you then thats not a problem.   You can get good vis here honestly. I have dived on reefs and wrecks, warm waters and cold. I'm not an old hand at this but I know what I like now. I also just came back from a trip to the Canary islands but I don't think warm water is what I like.  I look forward to Scotland and Wales, for wrecks and seals and drifts. I don't care about the vis so much. The diving is good fun and the people I do it with are the best.   The UK has a lot to offer, lots of lfe and lots to see. Optimism is extremely useful because the conditions can be rough. But my expectations are higher at home than away. Everyone has their thing though."
scuba,345905,drinkermoth,5,Tue Apr 28 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not from the UK and have not been diving there yet, but I dive in the NE USA and it's sort of similar conditions -- right now, water temperatures are about 4-6C, though visibility is pretty good. Some comments and thoughts:   Drysuits keep you warmer -- not necessarily warm. I think that was a misconception that I and other people had when we were getting into diving dry. I know a few people who wear heated vests, but that's a whole other thing and expense.  Around here, we have MANY wrecks, some of them from WW1 or WW2. I find it a lot more enjoyable and interesting when I research the wreck that we're diving before heading out there -- it makes it more interesting than just a pile of rubble. Another thing I found that makes it more fun is to take on some sort of task -- I do underwater photography, so that gives me something I can do regardless of the type of dive. I also carry a catch bag and clean up trash and fishing tackle that I find out there."
scuba,345905,Crash_Coredump,3,Tue Apr 28 12:40:09 2015 UTC,I am also not from the UK. I live in Northern Canada. Our water is average 4-8C. I dive dry. I have also dove with my backup 7mm wet when my dry-suit was out for repair. Its all about your personal comfort level and your bodies ability to handle being cold.  I wear a thermal suit under my bag type dry suit. (I have a BARE XCD2 and I have the matching T-100 and T-200 thermals) I am comfortable but after a long dive I am looking forward to shore. You may need to 'work' more to keep warm. I also just got back from a warm dive trip and enjoyed wearing my 3mm wet. My dive buddy was too warm in his and just went in swim trunks and shirt.  You will get used to it. If you are an indoor type person you might want to take up some outdoor pursuits that help your body acclimate to cooler temperatures. If you prefer you could always join a gym and start some basic Cardio workouts to help circulation.  Best of luck and happy bubbles.  edit: spelling
scuba,345905,DeepNorth,3,Tue Apr 28 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"Not from the UK, but right across the Channel in the NL. Water temperatures can drop to 4' C in winter and (especially in lakes) are pretty slow to climb as spring and summer come. I dove yesterday (first dive of the year, huzzah) and recorded 6'C at 12-14m, and 11'C at 6m. But, things will get better. Last year, I had some dives with temperatures of 18-20'C in Juli, and the summer hadn't even been that good. So, basically temperatures will continue to climb throughout the summer.  I started out as a wetsuit diver too, going through basically the same thing. Cold dives in early spring, late fall, but perfectly fine dives in summer. These days, I only dive in my dry suit (ScubaPro Fjord HD), with light undergarments in summer, and more layers in winter."
scuba,345905,nl_the_shadow,3,Tue Apr 28 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"Not UK based either, I'm based in Sweden. We dive pretty regularly in 2c water.   One thing that made a difference was my hands, getting dry gloves made a huge difference. Also, making sure that I was using the drysuit right; you need to have some air in it to be warm  In terms of ""why would you bother"", I look at it as training for diving in destinations; get the practice in here, then enjoy the nice dives all the more."
scuba,345905,toolieo,3,Tue Apr 28 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Drysuit, dry gloves, thick socks, just enough bubble to let the undergarments do the work.  I will never go back to diving wet. I was in 41F water for an hour yesterday and came out with slightly cold feet, but otherwise fine.  (Cold feet was my fault, I doubled up on socks, but that made my chucks too tight so I couldn't get a bubble into my feet).  Also, if you aren't either into wrecks (or the skills dives to let you safely dive wrecks), there's really no reason to get into the cold water, except in a few select places where the wildlife is really awesome."
scuba,345905,sharkiteuthis,2,Tue Apr 28 20:57:22 2015 UTC,I dive here in TX in drysuit (temps 10C to 20C). Still waiting for water to be in the 30+C range so I could dive in a t-shirt. There is nothing like being one with the water. Not to experience it though kind of a condom.

So you should dress to the conditions. And if your dive skills improve you will move a lot less then you do just after OW so you will feel the cold more when your skills improve. Personally I use drysuits for anything bellow 26'C with different kinds of base layers under the drysuit. So it is really only one solution to your problem, buy a drysuit. One of the cheapest and best suit if your on a budget is the Seaskin Nova. (made in the UK).  add a drysuit and a 400g undersuit and your diving experience is a totally new one. And for gods sake stop diving in the quarries instead of the sea. Take the drive up to Scotland and dive there, I dive a lot on the other site of the north sea (west coast of Norway) and the scenery here is magnificent so i guess Scotland should have some of the same conditions."

For my 'strategically shaved gorilla' body that meant getting a rather expensive custom suit. Take care of it! Seal saver and zipper was are a must.   Full body merino woll under your thermal layer is a must. Dry gloves are a super nice option, and make sure your hood fits tight. Dove last week and I was toasty warm.

In my experience, most dive locations which are big enough to support more than a single shop, the shops there will usually be associated with more than just a single certification agency.  Why not look into being an instructor for SSI, or SDI, or NAUI, or RAID? If that doesn't work out, you can still do the crossover at a later point."

scuba,344fym,CanadianDiver,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"Well, PADI is a business.  If you have every bought a cup of coffee from Starbucks, a bag of popcorn at the theatre or a cup of soda ANYWHERE ... then you should know that they are all taking far more liberties with their profit margin than PADI is.  As far as the Teaching Guide coming in a binder - it is supposed to be so you can easily update the materials without replacing the entire manual.  Is it expensive, yes. To be fair though, PADI has put together a far better training program than many other agencies when it comes to instructors ... I am certified as an instructor for more than PADI and can tell you that you get what you pay for.  The hologram sticker is merely a way to ensure that you have your own materials. As an instructor, you should be keeping them - not selling them when you are done. The same goes for DM's.  All that said, you can certainly hitch your wagon to any number of training agencies but if you want to be globally recognized you need to pay to join the club.  Oh, and you forgot the mention the $100 fees to self-certify for all the additional speciality courses you want to teach. (Or worse, you have to pay for a course from a Course Director!)  Want to teach Wreck? $100!  Want to teach Deep? $100!  Want to teach Dry Suit? $100!  Want to teach Nitrox? $100!  Want to teach O2? $100!  And the list goes on and on....

I get it that you don't approve of PADI making money but if that's really a problem for you then you should find an agency that won't charge you as much. Of course, and as you are aware, PADI also delivers the students which goes a long way towards justifying their fees.   Sheesh.

It seems like RAID is the popular kid these days (GUE is probably to hard for most)   Please dont belive the monopoly bullshit, most non divers dont give a f**k about what agency your are teaching with.

scuba,344fym,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:50:26 2015 UTC,"This is the quandary. You want to go with PADI as an instructor because they is the biggest so you get the best chance of a good job, but they are the biggest because they make a lot of money. They make it from you."
scuba,344fym,-hh,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:56:36 2015 UTC,"Nearly £800 (around $1200) for the IE costs   IE? or IDC? or IE + IDC? Around here the IDC is about $1300 by itself- but none of that goes to PADI- that's the cost of the course at the dive center.  On top of that you have both a $150 IDC application fee PLUS the IE fee which is another $600.   and I just forked out £375 for their crew pack ($570.)   Crew packs here are about $395- but you also need EFR instructor manual ($80) + EFR instructor course for another almost $200.  All told you're looking at $2800.00 to get certified as an instructor.  Now- while that's expensive- what do other professional certifications cost? Getting certified in various computer specialties can easily cost that much. JUST the exam fee for the CCIE is $2k. Add in training courses and required equipment/rentals and you can easily be at 2 to 3 times that.   FFS PADI you've printed the teaching guide on a laser printer. It's not even a colour one.   The price of the crew pack has nothing to do with the cost of the material the teaching guide is printed on. It took time to create the materials, proof read them, evaluate them, and so on- someone needs to be paid for that. The crew pack also includes all your training slates, the instructor guides for all the courses and specialties, and a few other items.   Don't even get me started on the £375 sticker that comes with the crew pack.   The sticker is there to prove you bought the crew pack. If you lose it- you have no proof. Moreover- why would you hire someone that couldn't even keep track of a simple sticker? Are you going to be that careless with students?  PADI does plenty of things I disagree with- but the cost of the crew pack and the cost of the IE are not two of them. The examiners have to fly out to the location where the exam is taking place, stay in a hotel for three nights or so- then fly home. It all adds up. Some IDCs are profitable because there are a lot of students. Others have few students and aren't. And as I mentioned- the crew pack cost isn't about the cost of the paper it's printed on- it's about the cost of developing and supporting the materials.  Having said all that- if you don't like PADI- why not become an instructor through another organization like NAUI or SSI?"
scuba,344fym,mxa020,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:26:42 2015 UTC,"First off, let's call a spade a spade:  while Certification certainly is important, it also isn't Rocket Science, as evidenced by the fact that one can become a DM or Instructor even without a High School diploma as a prerequisite...and the typical cost of a GED test is ~$100 (varies regionally).  Similarly, the dive training materials were first written 50 years ago (by NAUI) and incrementally evolved ever since...and then has been had its development costs amortized over literally tens of millions of paying customers.  As such, it would be an utterly scandalous example of corporate inefficiency if printing wasn't at least 75% of their true in-house production expenses (rather than 'development' being a big chunk) by now.  The rest is the retail mark-up, which has been on the rise because the Dive Industy base continues to shrink faster than the Agency's size/overhead has been contracted.  As the saying goes, Diving is a Business...and through this lens, we also gain insight retrospectively too."

As such, the only really effective way to get rid of them is to black yourself out as much as possible during your hang...ie, turn your lights OFF.  BTW, what I tend to do when I get a swarm is to find a diver around who's got a big, bright light.  I'll swim over near them, turn my light off and then swim away ... leaving them with an even bigger swarm.  Hope that wasn't you ;-)  EDIT:  there's another good reason to go 'dark' on safety stops, namely sea wasps which are also attracted to lights and like to hang out <10fsw.   A good trick to deal with these is when you're ready to do your final ascent, get right under the exit (dive boat ladder) at ~10fsw, then hit the purge button on your regulator ... long and hard.   The rising air will cause an upwelling of water, which then pushes a ""hole"" through the surface water, moving any sea wasps near the ladder away ... for around the 15 seconds you need to get up & out.  -hh"

For my AOW, I paid almost $400 for a weekend trip to Jupiter, FL.  That included the hotel, 6 dives, etc....everything.   SO going off of that, I would say Anything around $150 for instructor fees would be more than fair...it's what I would pay to a friend anyway."

It's usually more like $250-300.   Those prices are all-in prices.  Gear + boat + instructor + book + the cert fee to PADI.    Additional things to consider are: you're getting personal instruction, and this guy is nice enough to spend his fun dives that he's paying for to teach you.  Personally, I'd go $100-200 plus a nice bottle of scotch (or whatever his favorite drink is)."
scuba,341z6g,eanx100,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:40:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm paying for my share of the boat/lodging and bringing all of my own gear. The book is a cost I'm already covering separately.   Through our recreational and structured/instructed diving together (Nitrox, Cavern, and intro to Cave) he's already conducted a number of dives that would qualify for my five check-outs (Night, Deep, PPB, Boat, not sure whether Cavern counts). While I understand he will have to supervise on this trip, this is someone who has already supervised me doing most of these dives over the past two years."
scuba,341z6g,CanadianDiver,4,Tue Apr 28 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to consider.  First, I think you are over simplifying by saying any check-out dive is a 'tick the box' dive. So you are looking at a minimum of five check-out dives. Dives that he is now supervising and instructing you rather than diving for pleasure.  Second, these are at least five dives that he is officially on the hook if anything happens to you. While it may seem like a remote possibility, if it happens there is mountains of paperwork as well as liability issues he must now deal with.  Third, keep in mind that he has paid ... dearly ... for the privilege of being able to certify divers. He has paid for countless courses that are stupidly expensive and he must carry personal liability insurance.   So, if you add it up in its most basic form you are looking at an absolute minimum of five hours of diving, an hour or so of briefing and debriefing and another hour of paperwork ... what is at least 7 hours of time worth? And it is a holiday, so it should be time and a half! Add the cost of a c-card, about $30 ...   Now if this is truly a friend - he will probably not expect much, but I would offer a higher number and let him counter with a smaller number."
scuba,341z6g,SevenTreeIsle,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:17:10 2015 UTC,I would at the very least make sure you're paying your friend enough to cover the actual certification paperwork (they have to pay PADI or whoever the agency is).

There is NO better way to dive. Prices are usually $2500-$3500 depending on where you go, only Galapagos is way more than that. For everything included, it's actually cheaper than some shore diving when you realize it's 4 dives a day + night dives, 3 meals a day from an incredible cook, unlimited snacks, drinks, your room, living, and dive crew to help you with your every need.   As for why Galapagos, the animals and locations are second to none. Whale sharks, molamola, etc. Nowhere else can you find the variety of creatures. Not just that, but the creatures are...friendly, or at least not scared of divers, because the area is still relatively untouched by human hands."

I don't have much diving experience other then a few relatively shallow reef dives in Maui, however my love for the ocean made it a pretty easy decision as to what I want to do for my Birthday. And by the looks of it the Aggressor trip trumps every other destination Iv looked at .

Contacted a friend in Kenya about his spots to stay, he gave me some e-mails and phone numbers, again nothing.  Finally got a call back about a beach house on Zanzibar and he said sorry the price went up for that week.  e-mailed him back about a different week:  no reply.  It's just a really laid back place, so you have to plan early and flow with it.  For dive operations though, IMO your best bet is to google and use that list to start looking up reviews.  I haven't even gotten to the dive planning portion, since my diving will be only a small part of a 2 week stay in the country.  Also, I am having a hard time finding decent flights that don't go through Ethiopia.

If I could go back I would just dive 4 days at Mnemba. Visibility was as good as it gets, on one dive saw turtles, octopus, two sharks, and dolphins! The local kendwa dives had very poor visibility and very little sea life.  It's not so simple from kendwa because boats will only make the trek if there's a certain number if divers, but if you don't care about being in a speed boat I think it's pretty easy to find a wooden boats but it's a long day.  So all that said, if the focus of your trip is diving, stay somewhere on the north east where you can easily dive Mnemba everday.

scuba,3400g0,sapekpj,5,Mon Apr 27 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"Pragmatically, here's your options (for being nearsighted), from the cheapest to most expensive:   Canabalize an old set of glasses & stuff them into a mask (methods vary) Wear contact lenses with existing mask Buy a mask that's sold with off-the-shelf ""Drop In"" lenses (& buy the diopters you need) Buy a mask with cut-to-your perscription lenses such as from this company.     Discussion of Pros/Cons ...   To take a set of (often existing) lenses and put them into a mask can be a DIY juryrig (which can be as simple as taking the side earpieces off and taping/wedging them in somehow) or it can consist of custom lenses which are flat on the outside so that they can be bonded (glued) on the inside of the mask.   The advantage is CHEAP - - an old pair of glasses is ""free"" to experiment with.  The disadvantages are that the field of view is limited by the lenses you use, plus if it falls apart, you can only blame yourself.  I've personally never bothered with this approach.   Wearing a pair of contact lenses is simple & effective (and full view), but it does have a healthy risk of losing a lens when you flood your mask.  I did this a few times, but very gingerly ... it was before the age of cheap disposables and my lenses cost $150 each, so I was terrified of losing a lens.  I decided that it was pragmatically cheaper to move to the next option of drop-ins. A mask with a 'drop-in' lens is a quite good & cost-effective choice for anyone with a pretty simple Rx ... the drop-ins are in standard diopter increments, usually in full diopters (not halves), so if your perscription calls for -3.5, just get a -3 and it will be good enough.  I've had two masks of this type.   The cost is pretty reasonable -  my recollection is roughly $50-80 in addition to the cost of the mask.  Note that these drop-in lenses are specific to the mask design, so the mask OEM has to offer them as an available option.  Advantage: quite cost-effective & fullview. Disadvantage:  standard sizes result in not a ""perfect"" correction.  Is probably a challenge to find bifocals too (but see note).   Custom perscription .. you'll pay, but it will definitely be right, including astigmatism, prism, bifocals (if needed) and so forth and it will be fullview.  You can elect to save some money with a ""look under"" style rather than to get a proper bifocal, which is what I've been using for the past five years.     Note:  for far-sighted folks and/or those in the early stages of needing bifocals, there's also small magnification ""stickers"" you can put into most masks to effectively add a +1 bifocal for reading gages, etc.      My personal recommendations:  If you wear cheap disposable contacts, try em.   If your perscription is still pretty simple (and your eyes aren't picky) and you don't need bifocals to just get a 'drop-in'...and also to not put it off:  particularly in good viz, it really improves enjoyability.    Similarly, if your eyes are pretty lousy (as mine now are), bite the bullet and get a proper perscription.  Sure, it is now a $300 mask instead of a $100 mask, but in the big scheme of things, that's not too bad of a price to pay.  Lastly, do be aware of how much your eyes are changing from year to year ... if you're still in a period of relatively significant flux, unless you're doing 50+ dives/year it probably isn't worth spending a ton of money for a full blown perscription mask."

If you're like me and your astigmatism is much worse than your nearsightedness, this is pretty useless and you have to opt for option 4.  I find that for the viz I'm usually diving in, the extra air-water interface at the mask gives me plenty of optical ""power"" to resolve the things I need to see.

scuba,3400g0,stds9tng,3,Tue Apr 28 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"Will there be an additional lens that need to be clipped into the mask? Or is the default lens removed then a prescription lens put in place? Where can I get these lenses?   Depends on the mask. Most masks that take prescription lenses involve removing the existing lenses and replacing them with a prescription lens.  On masks where that isn't possible (single lens masks and the like) then the lenses can be permanently bonded to the inside of the lens.  Lenses that ""clip on"" would be harder to defog properly so if they exist- they're probably not a good choice anyway.  As for where to buy them- bring your mask and a current prescription to your local dive shop. For some masks with basic prescriptions (no astigmatism) they will have the lenses in stock. For other masks and more complicated prescriptions- they will need to order the lenses.  Or- you can use contacts :)"

If you do this be sure to select a mask that fits well then send it of to be lensed up because you don't want to make the mask much more expensive and take pot luck on fit.

Combine that with the fact that depth drains your cylinder much faster and it becomes less attractive still...  Diving deep is a means to an end, not a goal. In the cold, fresh water here in Canada - depth is associated with the best, most intact shipwrecks ... so when we dive deep - and we dive past 100 feet (not really that deep to me) often - it is to visit a shipwreck.  Down south, the vast majority of things to see are shallower than 80 feet, and usually shallower than 60 feet. This means longer, more enjoyable dives.  This is not to say that I don't like to go deep down south, but only if there is something specific to see."

scuba,33ynt7,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:15:27 2015 UTC,"In general, I find that the only reason to ""go deep"" is because of some specific landmark or objective which happens to be at whatever depth.     Some of this will be planned in advance (eg, wreck, cavern/swim-through, etc) whereas others might be more ad-hoc (eg, shark, turtle, etc, which happens by which is swimming past at deeper than your current nominal depth).    In general, it simply isn't worth going down to your 'max' depth just to cruise along to see what there might be to see.    In fact, it can be more frustrating to do this because if  when  you happen to see an interesting critter which is just a few feet below you, you're not at liberty to dip down to see it because you're already at your safe maximum.    And due to the shorter bottom time, my attitude has become one of ""Only as deep as I need to be"", and over time, one will learn through experience what depth is reasonably optimal for a site and conditions - - for example, on many tropical warmwater wall dives, I'll plan to cruise at 20-30ft below the wall's top edge (typically 60-80fsw), rather than going down to ""deep"", as I've found this to generally be the sweet spot for maximizing reef life/critters.    Sure, you'll still have the occasional reef shark cruising past deep, but they can easily slide down to 30-50ft deeper than whatever depth you're comfortable as your depth limit...you really will only get close if they're constrained by a hard bottom."

OK I like deep because that's where the undocumented wrecks are but it complicates your dive as you have restricted time and a long and very boring ride to get back to the surface.  Down to about 40 meters Nitrox is a good deal as it may make the dive no-stop or at least cut the decompression hang but below that it's trimix and costs a bomb (unless you are re-breathing) or your mind is so befuddled you don't actually remember much of your dive. If you are starting to venture deep for whatever reason consider a decompression course. What ever you do do not go into a dive with mandatory stops without a gas plan.
scuba,33ynt7,nigelh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:46:20 2015 UTC,"Like many have said, deep is when you see life drop off. I believe the numbers we typically see are that past 60-65', you lose most life. There's another little band of life that you'll see better suited to the deep later on. I wont pretend to know that number.   Deep, to me, is decompression diving. To make your time at depth worth it, you'll want special gas blends and go into these big long decompressions. It's a means to get to the cooler ship wrecks, or you are off doing crazy tech/commercial diving stuff that is past the ""Let's see neat fishes!"" sort of diving. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Fishes are awesome."
scuba,33ynt7,doombuggy110,-2,Sun Apr 26 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"If you're getting Deep, also get Nitrox to get you a bit more bottom time."
scuba,33ynt7,oddible,-2,Sun Apr 26 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"NO.  This is bad advice. Nitrox, at recreational levels, is adding oxygen to the tank, up to 40%. Since there are a number of limiting factors with diving, nitrogen saturation is only one of them. The one that actually limits your diving depth is oxygen toxicity. Your body can handle (about) 1.6 atm partial pressure of oxygen.  If you are breathing straight air, your ppO is basically .2 of the pressure of your depth. Since pressure at depth increases linearly (increasing 1 atm for every 10 M/33 ft), you can handle 7 atm/70 meters/220 feet on straight air.    Recreational nitrox INCREASES the amount of oxygen in the air you're breathing.  Instead of 21% O2, you're breathing 32%, or 40%.  Divers do this so tehy do not get the nitrogen load, have more energy, and can do more dives. But, at 40% o2, your max depth is only 4 atm/30 meters/99 feet.    For a safety measure, divers shouldn't be diving above 1.4ppO2.  You CAN do 1.6, but you're also gambling you don't tox out.  And, like the House in Vegas, eventually you're going to crap out.    If you want to dive really deep, take a deco class.  They will get into the different gasses you will need to make those dives.  To go that deep, you're probably breathing some mixture of heliox or go with a rebreather.  I'm not sure how deep a rebreather will let you go."
scuba,33ynt7,yogfthagen,9,Sun Apr 26 23:23:23 2015 UTC,40 metres on air = 16 min run time no stop.   40 metres on 28% = 19 min run time no stop CNS 9% OTU's 22    That's about a 20% increase in bottom time for negligible O2 loadings. I would say a nitrox ticket is worth it's weight!
scuba,33ynt7,orobljoe,4,Sun Apr 26 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but your understanding of Nitrox is not correct.   Yes, there is a Maximum Operating Depth to every Nitrox mix, but you are referring to extremes not proper gas planning. Review the section on Best Mix Calculations and then review the CNS clock numbers.  The statement you make about having more energy diving on Nitrox is also not a scientific fact, but rather an anecdotal observation by some divers with no physiological proof to back it up.  An air dive to 220 feet - while possible - is also not a great choice."
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,-3,Mon Apr 27 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"The statement I responded to did not mention proper gas planning.  Nor did it state that increasing o2 reduces max possible depth.  It didn't state anything about rec limits. As for ""having more energy,"" there's a thing called nitrogen narcosis.  Narco - sleep.  Having less nitrogen in your body means you're going to be more alert/not be as sleepy/have more energy. And, a 40% nitrox dive to 100 feet is as bad as an air dive to 220 feet, an important point I made in my post because the discussion was about going DEEPER."
scuba,33ynt7,yogfthagen,4,Mon Apr 27 03:42:20 2015 UTC,"As for ""having more energy,"" there's a thing called nitrogen narcosis.   First, narcosis is narcotic but not necessarily sleep inducing.  Second, both nitrogen and oxygen have narcotic properties at increased partial pressures. The use of Nitrox has no effect on narcosis susceptibility.   You are also now citing your own bad advice and an example against your own bad advice. When planning a 100 foot dive, you would not choose a 40% mix if you dive a 1.4 PO2 - it is a simple calculation that you should have learned if you took an Enriched Air class.  The general context of this thread is about recreational diving, so we have specific parameters that restrict the discussion ... recreationally you are dealing with a max depth of about 130 feet and a maximum of 40% nitrox ... but that doesn't link the two.  If you are going to do some deep diving, Nitrox is a good idea. You should definitely, take a Nitrox class before diving it so that you understand the benefits, risks and general safety considerations of its use. You should NOT sign up for an online only class in Nitrox and think you know what you are talking about."
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,4,Mon Apr 27 16:25:02 2015 UTC,Worth noting that the term nitrogen narcosis has mainly been replaced with inert gas narcosis.  its believed oxygen has the same effect as nitrogen at depth in terms of narcosis
scuba,33ynt7,jms700,2,Mon Apr 27 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"As for ""having more energy,"" there's a thing called nitrogen narcosis. Narco - sleep. Having less nitrogen in your body means you're going to be more alert/not be as sleepy/have more energy.   Yes, there is a thing called nitrogen narcosis, and this isn't what you are describing. Nitrogen narcosis is the feeling of euphoria/exhilaration/intoxication that occurs when diving a gas mix with a high partial pressure of nitrogen. There is a wide range of susceptibility to narcosis so it may occur at different depths for different divers, but tends to begin at a partial pressure of 4 ata. Various groups state that breathing gases other than helium all have some sort of narcosis effect, and therefore recommend including oxygen in calculations that determine the equivalent narcotic depth of a dive for a given mix and depth."
scuba,33ynt7,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:14:10 2015 UTC,"A dive beyond the MOD of a nitrox mix is far more dangerous than a air dive beyond rec limits.   One will induce a nitrogen narcosis, which is bad, but going over the MOD of a nitrox mix is going to give you a oxygen poisoning, which is far more dangerous.   The seizure may occur suddenly and with no warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown."
scuba,33ynt7,Eldritch800XC,3,Mon Apr 27 11:02:17 2015 UTC,"One will induce a nitrogen narcosis,   Nitrox use does NOT prevent narcosis. If you were taught this in your class - ask for your money back. Both nitrogen and oxygen have narcotic effects at depth ... increasing one to decrease the other does nothing to change your narcosis susceptibility."
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,-1,Mon Apr 27 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"Please read again what I wrote. I never even suggested that Nitrox will prevent narcosis, just pointed out the difference between a Nitrogen Narcosis and Oxygen Toxicity."
scuba,33ynt7,Eldritch800XC,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:49:08 2015 UTC,So then which gas is the 'one' that doesn't induce narcosis?
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,0,Tue Apr 28 03:58:28 2015 UTC,"I was just comparing going over MOD with Nitrox against going over MOD with Air.  Going over Air depth limit -> Nitrogen Narcosis  Going over MOD with Nitrox -> Oxygen Toxicity, long before Nitrogen Narcosis  I didn't rule out narcosis on Nitrox."
scuba,33ynt7,Eldritch800XC,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"What?  Exceeding your MOD on air will result in oxygen toxicity,  MOD does not refer to narcosis. What are you talking about?  MOD refers to your maximum operating depth due to oxygen toxicity. 21% has a much deeper MOD than a richer mix,  but exceeding the MOD puts you at danger of oxygen toxicity, it's not different if you are diving 21%, 32%, 50%, or 100%."
scuba,33ynt7,Crash_Coredump,5,Tue Apr 28 11:49:59 2015 UTC,So dive 28% to 130'. IIRC this gets you 8 minutes bottom time on the PADI table vs. 5 minutes on 21%. PPO2 is 1.4 on 28% at that depth.   You don't need trimix or heliox to go to 130'. I think GUE has a standard mix of 21/35 for depths from 110-130 but plenty of people dive nitrox or even air to the recreational limit.
scuba,33ynt7,Crash_Coredump,4,Sun Apr 26 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"You don't need trimix, but it makes the experience much more pleasant"
scuba,33ynt7,jonny_boy27,2,Mon Apr 27 10:58:17 2015 UTC,"Considering one person was talking about going to 75 to 100 meters, the ""depth"" that was being thrown around was WELL beyond recreational limits. And, by the way, there are a lot of divers who do not know that increasing your O2 percentage reduces your ability to go to depth.  Simply saying ""take a nitrox course for more bottom time"" leaves out a VERY important warning."
scuba,33ynt7,yogfthagen,6,Mon Apr 27 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"Though to be fair, the nitrox course would teach that."
scuba,33ynt7,GottaGetOuttaHere,2,Mon Apr 27 13:18:56 2015 UTC,Like I said... get a Nitrox cert so you can understand the effects of different mixes and improve your bottom time. I'm sticking to rec limits and Nitrox is great for diving the deeper wrecks.
scuba,33ynt7,oddible,-3,Mon Apr 27 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"Then say you're sticking to rec limits, and warn the person about diving deep with nitrox.  At high nitrox even going to rec limits is dangerous."
scuba,33ynt7,yogfthagen,5,Mon Apr 27 03:37:14 2015 UTC,This is the job the the Nitrox instructor. Telling someone that using Nitrox is dangerous is just bad advice - and incorrect.
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,3,Mon Apr 27 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"He was talking about the 'Deep' qualification, which is within Rec limits.  He didn't say tec diving.  I assumed the dive community was aware of what 'Deep' diving certification meant."
scuba,33ynt7,oddible,3,Mon Apr 27 04:37:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am not even sure the OP means his Deep Diving cert but rather just diving deep versus to say 60 feet ... either way, it is definitely a recreational discussion in my opinion."
scuba,33ynt7,CanadianDiver,0,Mon Apr 27 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"The PADI & Co. ""deep"" dive cert just gets you to 40 instead of 30 m. There is hardly a difference in marine life in most places in those 10 meters. However, those ten meters can make a big difference to the number of sites you will be allowed to dive.  I live in Australia, and there are a fair number of pinnacles and other points of interest in reach of the east coast which bottom out at around 35 or 40 meters. There are also a number of wrecks below the 30 meter mark.  Now, being a tech deep diver is a completely different story."
scuba,33ynt7,FormerlyTurnipHugger,0,Sun Apr 26 22:21:13 2015 UTC,"""Deep"" recreational dives are pointless given the short bottom times you get due to gas and decompression constraints. What's the point of doing a dive with 5-10 minutes bottom time? They are also riskier and require a more careful gas planing.   If you want to go deep in any meaningful way you'll have to invest some $$$$$ in technical training and gear, and then pay $$$ per dive for gas in case of OC."
scuba,33ynt7,lynng,-1,Tue Apr 28 10:30:08 2015 UTC,As others have said the marine life seen at say 50m compared to 30 is not the same or as good. When I was at 50m the only thing we seen were larger rays. The majority of good marine life will be seen between 10-20 meters as that's where you get the most sun light. However the best wrecks tend to be 25m and deeper.   Wrecks are why I chose to do deep diving and technical as well as future job opportunities.
scuba,33ynt7,famousmodification,-1,Sun Apr 26 22:38:57 2015 UTC,"Like what everyone else is saying... Unless you get into crazy technical diving, the life you see isn't really going to be much different. The main difference is in the sites you can visit. The better wrecks tend to be deeper, since the shallower they are, the faster storms will mess them up.  I'd say being able to do deeper dives is worth it, but that's mostly a matter of having big enough tanks and possibly nitrox, as far as I'm concerned."

Putting you in mega stressful situtations, like being oxygen deprived and nightmare ""students"" and having gear ripped off was all done in my Rescue and DMT courses.   My ITC was basically learning how to teach the classroom stuff, that my in water skills and demonstrations were on point and I was always in control of my students. There was much more focus on buzz words, and selling equipment and courses than there was on anything actually diving related when it came to out of water stuff. The hardest part of the course was standing up infront of the group and doing a presentation. After my 2nd though it was just following the steps and again became pretty easy.  For in water stuff we'd do the ""student has a problem"" and you have to fix it thing, but we'd only be allowed to do things wrong we were told to do wrong. We'd never start break dancing during a fin pivot because you'd never be asked to do that during the exam.  It was for sure less fun but I went into the exam knowing I'd pass the course. There are only so many things you can do wrong and once you miss a problem once, you don't miss it again.  My rescue course and DMT was absolutely full of dicking around though. My favourite thing to do was go on dives with other DMTs/DMs/Instructors and play The Matrix. We'd find a patch of sand, take our fins off and do backflips and slow motion chases and dodging bullets."

I think we rely a lot on real experience for that problem-solving stuff.  I can't say for sure, but I think that the actual exam is way less funny/screwy. The semester-long course we have is full of training that allows us to be silly.  I love that! I wish we weren't in a lake that silts up if you think about the bottom."

scuba,33thyf,-hh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Guess you watched a different video. To me it looked like two people spotted a penguin and kept two meters away from it (the recommended distance) amid the 8,010 km2 (3,090 sq mi) which make up the Galapagos. That to me would seem like the opposite of of ""over-crowding"". 3 beings in that much space."
scuba,33thyf,-hh,0,Mon Apr 27 21:20:03 2015 UTC,"Guess you watched a different video.   Nope, not at all.     The video makes it quite clear that the videographer approached a bird on roost and intruded its space - - despite warning cues - - until the bird left its roost and went into flight escape response.  All in a mere 19 seconds from the bird's first alert at 0:06   ... kept two meters away from it (the recommended distance) ...   And the penguins can read to know this ...since when?  Guidelines are merely that and not a license to follow them to the letter regardless of consequences.   Apparently, your definition of harassment requires nothing less than grabbing, squeezing & hugging.  And while 2m might be adequate guidance for an in-water encounter, that's because of their excellent speed & maneuverability while they're in their element.  However, when out of the water, they're quite clumsy and vulnerable, so the rules of engagement have to be adjusted accordingly to greater standoff distances:  and FYI, roosting on land is specifically to rest and to rewarm their core body temperature.    But please continue to try to defend the videographer's ignorant actions.    Perhaps you can relay to them that they were lucky enough to see an endangered species which has had multiple 50% crashes to its indigenous populations within just our lifetime due to mass starvations from El Nino events ... and encourage them to join those of us who have been making regular donations to the Galapagos Conservancy ever since our own trip(s) there.    -hh"
scuba,33szyk,randomninja8,7,Sat Apr 25 09:21:56 2015 UTC,"Career Instructor here, and devil's advocate.  I take nothing with me on vacation, and have never had a problem on any continent with gear that wasn't addressed immediately and satisfactorialy by my local dive operator. My personal mask is nice, but only one of millions with an identical skirt size. My bcd is waycool, but who cares?  I can see how the equipment functions before I dive and certainly shouldn't panic at every little problem that will likely not come along. I also have TripAdvisor reviews which are definitely going to let me know if others had bad experience with a shops gear, or anything else for that matter.   I regularly see people who bring everything in big, heavy bags and many who even flew with their own weights and nitrox analyzers. Their stuff is shiny and new, their computers are mysteries to them, but they are proud at the stuff they own, because it makes them DIVERS! After all, they go almost every year. Sometimes twice. Or maybe it is older, used and broken in. Either way, I am much  more likely to have to repair or replace a customers gear last  minute than rental gear, which I am also proud of.  Not to mention air2 compatibility issues, makeshift equipment, etc.  So they make me a bit nervous. Part of my job is to be a bit nervous, so I can take better care of them when trouble does arise. Possession of equipment rarely corresponds with experience or competence (I just taught another open water with a shiny new set of gear that will likely go straight back in the garage wet next week), but often accompanies an ""I know everything, i'm so awesome, why would I ever let a dive leader tell me how to dive?"" attitude. We see it often enough that I consider it worthy of mention here.  You should be a confident enough diver to examine gear functions, anticipate and solve problems and you shouldn't dive with an operator you have no confidence in. Your experience will  not be diminished by rental gear.  There. Just saved you money. Not something we in the industry are typically known for..."
scuba,33szyk,bobbyjihad,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"Your experience will not be diminished by rental gear.   I think this is the bottom line that /u/bobbyjihad was getting to and while I agree with 80% of it, there are some notable exceptions.  Mask being an example.  If one needs a prescription mask, do not leave it home.    Another being thermal protection.   I can recall freezing my posterior off when in Hawaii, and that was in muy own full 3mm - - I've noticed that shorties are quite popular as rental gear (easier to fit more people and easier on/off for novices), but thermally, I know that it wouldn't cut it and I would have been even colder on said dives.     Rental gear gets used a lot, and will have more opportunities for having some issues here or there.   Overall, I'd say that the most susceptible piece of worn-out gear will be a leaking BCD.    -hh"
scuba,33szyk,-hh,5,Mon Apr 27 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"We take our gear, and just share a bag. That way it's effectively half the price, and we have gear we know we can depend on. As to the partially wet BCD issue, that's two-fold: you gear should be in a dedicated bag, so the only stuff getting wet is other gear, so no biggie, but also you shouldn't be diving the last day or two of your trip (since you're flying), which is plenty of time to dry off your gear. We actually use the Seac U-Boot as our bag, and it fits all our gear (mask, fins, snorkels, booties, bcds, knives, reels) and is waterproof with a dump/rinse valve.  Also, can't stress this enough: carry on your computers, regs, cameras and lights. That stuff is way too sensitive to leave to baggage throwers handlers."

scuba,33szyk,garuba2,3,Sat Apr 25 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"We take all of our gear and just pay if necessary.  I feel more confident diving in my gear, where I know the service record and exactly where everything is.  I also set everything out to dry a day before leaving, since we always do a 24 hour surface interval before flying.  I would say take it all, or if you decide against that just take your mask/snorkel/booties and rent the rest."
scuba,33szyk,Hurras,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"I think confidence is key.  My father doesn't get to dive frequently enough to be really comfortable with his gear, so I think putting him back on rentals might be even worse.   Our itinerary shows us having our last dive three days before our flight which should be great.  The charter mentioned another if there's time but we haven't solidified anything it seems.  Mask, snorkel, and booties for sure, got it!"

scuba,33szyk,headhunter71,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:40:42 2015 UTC,"Your computer only uses the transmitter to display your available air pressure. You can use the computer without problem on any dive without the transmitter attached to your 1st stage. Just remember to look at your SPG every few minutes instead of your wrist. I second the notion of mask and computer being all you really need. I like having my own gear too, but the price of an extra bag will be more than the price of the rental gear."

I rent the bcd, weights and anything else for usually $10 a dive but in most cases as I dive with one operator that week I get a better deal."

The exhaust fan takes longer, but is still effective. just make sure everything is hanging as open as possible so it has a ton of airflow."
scuba,33szyk,lackin,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"I take all of my own gear, even if I know I'll have to pay a little extra for the luggage. I'm really picky/territorial about my gear, though. I have traveled with my Mares Pro Tec whatever folding BC, but now I travel with my BP/W setup. With the Mares, which is more like what you're looking at with the Knighthawk, I have one of those giant dive bags. I can fit most of my luggage in there and then cram my diving kit and most of my lady friend's as well - though she didn't have a BC at that time. Personally, I carry on my regs in another bag (this one works great with the long hose system I use) and I usually keep my mask and light (if I feel like bringing my can light) and computer and all that in my carry on.   The rules I learned for traveling with this stuff are basically that you should carry on anything you can't dive without (I won't dive without my own reg set that I know works perfectly, and I love my mask). I now keep my backplate (and light and mask and computer...) in my carryon and put the wing in the checked bag to save on weight. You should probably just expect to pay the luggage fee. It sucks, but it's so worth it (I think) to get there and have all your own gear. Plus, I've been crazy fortunate to have really lax gate attendants! I had a bag that was like 10 pounds over weight getting onto some little puddle jumper and they didn't charge me for it.   As for wet gear? Don't dive (which you shouldn't be doing any way) at least 24-36 hours before your flight leaves or you have to pack up. I usually make my last dives of the trip two or three days before I leave so I don't get home with a couple thousand dollars of moldy equipment or moldy/gross clothes.   Best of luck and I hope you enjoy your trip!"
scuba,33szyk,nigelh,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is, paying an extra $70 for the baggage is a once off payment, but hiring gear could cost you that much for each dive trip. So it depends how many dives you're doing and how much they charge for rental. It's probably worth bringing your own BCD."

The dives are short (30-40min).   The DMs are lazy and don't look for stuff to point out.  There are also some safety concerns since some of the DMs don't have computers or timepieces and do things like take inexperienced divers (< 10 OW dives) to 110 ft.   If you want to go into town, you either have to take a $5 taxi or walk for 40 minutes."
scuba,33tkzg,oxygen_narcosis,2,Sat Apr 25 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"Um.... I have been to Cozumel 5 times and been all over the Island and have never heard good thing about either of these places you are talking about. I am a Cozumel veteran and I think you should go with a different plan.  Look for an all inclusive resort that has good reviews, has a pool bar, has formal dinners you sign up for, and serves breakfast lunch and supper. Look for a dive shop that does night dives. Cozumel night dives are not surpassed by any diving you can do in the world. You want to stay away from the International piers while diving.  Palancar reefs are the best along with a bunch of other reefs that are far away from the cruise ship piers. Don't allow dive shops to take you on shitty dives. Baracudda, Palancar Gardens, Palancar Bricks, and a few others are amazing. Refuse to go on any ""Paradise reef"" dives they are garbage. Do a few night dives.  Hotel Cozumel is super cheap and in the middle of town and is the most convenient hotel that is all inclusive. Its worth it for the Liqour and snacks and you can go out and have fun. I only stayed there once with a few college friends and we had 2 billionaires, and 3 multi-millionaires also stay there with us. So don't stick your nose up at cheap options. It also had an excellent dive shop connected to it.  The Iberostar is the best option for an all inclusive resort on the Island. The others don't have all the benefits the Iberostar can offer. It has a pool bar, good food, and formal dinners. It has excellent breakfasts, lunches and dinners. It also has a disco and entertainment.  Also ONLY IF YOU ARE AN AMAZING DIVER THAT WON'T PANIC, the Devil's Throat is the most advanced dive and also one of the most untouched easily accessible reefs in the world and no one gets to dive it unless requested and everyone is very experienced. It is an overhead environment and very deep. It is the coolest dive in Cozumel.  Riviera Maya/ Playa Del Carmen also has some amazing Advanced level dives because not many people get to go to the more advanced areas."

I've used Dive with Martin and was happy with them, though it's been a few years since I used DWM.  I was last in Cozumel January 2014.  I don't recommend staying at an all-inclusive in Cozumel. You will want to eat good food in town at night (perfectly safe). I'd strongly recommend El Moro restaurant, however you will need a taxi to get there.   I've stayed at Vista Del Mar, Villa Blanca, The Barracuda and Casa Del Mar as well as a bed and breakfast. (about 7 trips).  All were fine but I'm pretty low maintenance. The Barracuda can be noisy during the day."
scuba,33tkzg,wileyc,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:25:56 2015 UTC,"I recently dove in Cozumel, but was based South of where you will be staying, at the Sunscape Sabor. We dove with both Dive House and Dive With Martin, and while both were great, Dive With Martin was far cheaper. From the looks of things, Papa Hog's will be a bit more expensive than Dive With Martin, but cheaper than Dive House, it's probably about average. I'd be interested in hearing what you think of them when you come back.  In terms of things you might want to be aware of: if you're diving the reefs, your boat will likely go down the coast, picking up other divers at resorts along the way, so the first part of your morning will be spent waiting. Make sure you bring at least a wind-breaker, since you'll be spending a large amount of time on the water mostly immobile, and even in summer it can be breezy and get chilly in the mornings.  Also, you will be required to provide a park fee every day, in exchange for a bracelt. This fee is $2 USD, if I recall correctly. This does not go to the dive operator, but to the government to keep the marine park in good shape (cleanup operations, etc...). This has to be provided in cash, so make sure you have it on you. You should also tip your boat operator and DM if they're good, usually a couple dollars is fine, more if they're excellent.  In terms of the hotels, I can't really give you any advice, as I've never stayed at either of those, hopefully others can help you in that respect.  Also, I cannot stress this enough: take one day off and rent scooters to tour around the whole island (it's not a super long drive, and there's a dedicated scooter road). Their roads are actually very well kept, we had no issues there, even though the rental guy said they were ""bad"". It's a ton of fun going around the island, it's so beautiful, and it's a great way to see a lot of stuff. There's the Celarain lighthouse at the southern tip, the reggae bar not far from it, all kinds of beaches up the eastern shore, the tequila factory (don't drink and scoot) and the San Gervasio ruins about mid-island going back towards San Miguel, and then the town itself. You can easily see all that in a day on scooters, and it's quite awesome.  Finally, if you're interested in just looking at the other all-inclusive hotels down the western shore, you can in fact just show up and ask them for a tour (no need to buy a $50 day pass). They're more than happy to show you around, particularly if you say that you're looking at planning another trip, which is what we were doing. It really helps cut through all of the crap that's sometimes in online reviews."

As long as you feel okay with your capabilities on the drug bearing in mind it is psychoactive and you are sure it is not negatively affecting your decision making I'd say you're mentally okay to dive, which hopefully your doctor can answer.   The biggest concern I'd have is physiological, as you said even your doctor isn't sure about it - they generally aren't aquatically trained. It will affect your cardiovascular system in one way or another but then again so does cold and stress (which can increase the likelihood of DCS.)Decompression theory is based on experimental data and none of those experiments have been performed with subjects taking reasonably strong stimulants such as the medication you're on.  For this reason I would say no until you hear otherwise from a professional!   I'm not a doctor, this is based purely on my own somewhat limited information. Just as I was told last week don't trust your life to answers from strangers on the net! If you decide you're off diving please be more conservative with your profiles."

Then there is the unknown of how being at depth will change the effects. That is what worries me.   I'll probably not take my daily dose until after I dive this week, and talk to my instructor about it. He has been teaching scuba to college students for years now, so I can't be the first person on meds like this to come through his class.  Thanks for the advice and the reminder to be conservative.

I never understood the park service being so protective of the B-29, hell until recently you needed trimix to get to it.  It is still a tech dive, and will probably remain that way even if the lake drops lower.

scuba,33t5ys,ahugenerd,7,Sat Apr 25 17:41:10 2015 UTC,The nice thing to do would be to send them back to the return address.

How exactly are you going to sell them without the original invoice, or warranty, or knowing if they still work, or if they are reported as stolen? That's a pretty risky transaction for any potential buyer. Besides, what you're doing is still illegal even if no one will put the effort of tracking you down."
scuba,33s1yk,ieatpuppiezz,10,Sat Apr 25 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely have a pressure gauge in addition to the computer, I've had at least two computers die on me in the water.   That said you seem to be asking whether its worth also getting an analog depth gauge in addition to a pressure gauge. I would say yes - if your computer dies it's good to be able to measure your rate of ascent and do stops at appropriate depths.  The price difference is honestly not that big, it doesn't add an extra hose to your setup, I can't really think of a good reason not to."

scuba,33s1yk,CanadianDiver,6,Sat Apr 25 02:20:59 2015 UTC,Hang on a sec...  That is a Zoop.  It is NOT an air integrated computer. An analog pressure gauge is not a back up ... it's your ONLY source for air pressure. This isn't even a consideration - you will NEED a pressure gauge.
scuba,33s1yk,runsongas,2,Sat Apr 25 22:10:17 2015 UTC,how do you plan on finding your way back to shore or the boat without a compass? DGX and piranha both sell wrist compasses for around 35 bucks or so.  i'm not a huge fan of analog depth gauges. I just carried a wrist computer when I got my first set of gear and added a 2nd computer for backup later on.  brass and glass spg on a regular hose. leave the 6 inch hoses for stages/sidemount.
scuba,33s1yk,doofthemighty,2,Sat Apr 25 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"The Zoop does not show you your air pressure. It's an Air/Nitrox computer meaning that it can calculate your NDL/Deco time based on whether you're breathing air or nitrox in your tanks but it no way will tell you how much pressure is in your tanks. So, yes, you should also buy a pressure gauge. Not as a backup but because otherwise you won't have one at all.  EDIT: I might have misunderstood your question. If you're asking about needing an analog pressure gauge then my answer above stands. If you're asking about using an analog depth gauge along with the pressure gauge you're going to buy, then, that's really up to you. I only use my Suunto Vyper for my depth gauge as long as I'm diving within recreational limits. If the computer dies during the dive, then 1 of 3 things happens.   I'm ok as I'm at a depth well within limits and don't need to worry about exceeding my depth or NDL. I can check with my buddy to make sure we're still at a good depth/time I can call the dive.   If I'm diving outside of recreational limits, whether that's doing a deco dive, cave, etc. Then my Vyper is in guage mode and I'm using a trimix computer as my primary. Although truthfully if I'm planning a deco dive then I'm pretty much just using both as a bottom timer/depth gauge anyway as I've cut tables for the dive and I'm following my deco plan that way."

I had one of those big consoles that showed me everything I needed to know, but never looked at it because of the computer. Now, I'm diving the longhose/Hogarthian system and I have my Petrel and a simple SPG to read pressure. I would never trust my computer not to fail when I'm in some challenging environment where I need to decide if I have the air to go back to some point or just ascend. Always have an analog SPG.  Compass, I always say that you should grab some $35 wrist one. If you use one on the gauge, you're going to be a little less accurate or you'll be tugging on that hose wishing you just had two more inches."

scuba,33pl3y,gumball_guard,3,Fri Apr 24 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"I have done several week-long diving trips to Roatan and loved it.  There is a wide variety of diving to do there for various skill levels.  I particularly enjoyed staying and diving with Anthony's Key resort.  It's all-inclusive, very nice and well run.  Excellent dive boats and they will put you on the best dive spots around.  I recommend it.   Where are you coming from?  For what you describe, the Upper Keys in Florida are excellent, as well.  I have seen as much or more diversity and ever growing numbers of critters there.    Plus there are a lot of easy dives in and around Key Largo.  It's inexpensive to get to, airfare is cheap to Miami or Ft. Lauderdale and there are lots of hotels and dive operators.  Rainbow Reef and Conch Republic are both very good dive ops who can put you on great dives.  I think that Rainbow has a deal with the Marriott Courtyard next door and right on the dock where they keep their boats.  Pickles Reef, Hens and Chickens, Crocker Reef and the wreck of the Benwood are all easy dives for a newbie.  If you want some more places to dive, drive further south to around Marathon and check out Looe Key and Sombrero Reef.  Sombrero is a radial spur-and-groove reef with lots of sand chutes between the coral spurs.  There are dozens of places to dive radiating around the central lighthouse out for several hundred yards and most of it is 15-35 feet deep.  It's like a giant aquarium.  Super easy for beginners.  I've had good luck diving with Tildens there, but I'm pretty sure there are others who service that reef, also.  If you have a little bit of money to burn, one of my favorite places is Bonaire.  Very easy shore diving, and while the airfare is kinda pricey, there are great deals for week-long all-inclusive dive packages.  Not many big critters, but lots of smaller and very cool things to see.  Its the only place where we have seen frogfish and seahorses.  The last time I was there we were swarmed by dolphins.  But that has happened to me in the Keys, too."

I just use my GoPro3+ for video and either the angle is so wide I get everything I want, or I get so close it would be impossible to miss the shot. In my case I'd go with the Black. If you're going to be taking a lot of stills you may be better off with the Silver since it has the screen for framing even though the image quality is slightly less."

Because you always bring your own view of things, your experiences and personality influence what you point the camera at, and that means there's always the potential to create something unique and valuable.

scuba,33m30m,pathdaft,2,Thu Apr 23 17:56:49 2015 UTC,I had a hard time deciding which action camera to buy and spent a good amount of time searching for the best camera for me. I stumbled upon this cool site www.actionscamera.com that asked me a few personal questions and my preferences. It then recommended the best camera for my needs. You should check it out.
scuba,33m30m,pathdaft,1 point,Sun May 3 08:32:59 2015 UTC,"The difference would be better spent on getting a decent dive light. The Hero is not a great low light performer. Moreover, you will also need to get a set of red light filters, which will further impact the amount of light reaching the sensor."
scuba,33m30m,pathdaft,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"So you'd say just go with the Silver then?  I've done research on red light filters and seen some pictures, does it really make that much of a difference?  Do you have a recommendation for dive light that would compliment well with a GoPro?  I have dive lights for when we dive in dark rivers where visibility is limited."
scuba,33m30m,runsongas,2,Thu Apr 23 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"I find the filter makes a difference at 20-50 feet. For deeper than 50, there is a deep filter, but the image (or video) quality on the Hero suffers from chromatic noise. Keep in mind this is without a dive light. Personally, I wouldn't bother with shooting pictures or video in 50+ feet without a light.  As for lights, there are lots of options. I went with the Sola Dive 1200 because I wanted compact. Light and Motion, the company that makes the Sola, recently released the Sidekick. It is a small light suitable for diving that is designed with the Hero in mind. I have no personal experience with it, but it might be worth the look. If the Sidekick is too underpowered, the Gobe also seems reasonable.  For me, I would prioritize the Hero 4 Silver over the Hero 4 Black. You will want an LCD to compose the shot. The 4K is nice to have, but it doesn't mean much if you're not sure what you're shooting/filming."
scuba,33m30m,phorkor,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:30:40 2015 UTC,Sola 1200 def is not cheap though ha.  Yeah I saw a recent post on the Sidekick which I thought was cool as to how it would fit around the Hero.  I'll look into how practical it is though.  Yeah that's kind of what I'm thinking and from watching comparison videos it's not that big of a difference for someone who is just shooting for pleasure.  So I'm probably thinking the same as you on this.  Thanks for the advice.
scuba,33m30m,arj15,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"When I first started diving, I was shooting with a Hero 3+ Black. The bro was shooting with the same but with the LCD. There was a huge difference in usable video. While most of mine had subjects somewhere in the frame, it was almost never in the center, and more often than not, it was at the edge of the frame. Useless footage."
scuba,33m30m,apostle228,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"depends on how deep and the conditions of the dive. if you dive in low vis conditions or deep, then video lights are pretty much a must have else your video will not show enough light and color even with postprocessing. video lights have a larger beam angle (120 is common) versus dive lights that are usually 6 to 8 degree beams. red filters only work well for very clear water with plenty of natural light at the depth you are shooting.  sola lights are pretty much the gold standard but aren't very cheap."
scuba,33m30m,-hh,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:55:08 2015 UTC,Typically it's pretty decent to clear vis and not too deep.  Deepest being no more than 70'.  Okay I'd figured they wouldn't be the same.  We should have plenty of nati light where we dive so I'll prolly just stick with that for now.

scuba,33jkqf,richiericardo,2,Fri Apr 24 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"Just as important, is D-Ring positioning.   Put on your harness. Put your arms out like a T, with your palms facing down and thumb sticking out.   Bend your elbows and bring your thumb to your shoulder straps.   Right here is where you want 1 D ring on each shoulder strap.  If you use Halcyon webbing you can count the H's to know placement. If you use plain webbing with no markings you will have to estimate or mark.   For your left hip D-Ring, put your left arm straight down and face your palm backward and stick your thumb out toward your body. Now lift your arm until your thumb is in your armpit and trace a line down the center of your body. When you reach your hip, this is where the D-ring should be positioned.   This will make clipping and unclipping bolt snaps, pressure gauge, etc. a fair bit easier for you.  Shoulder straps shouldn't be adjusted too tight. easy enough to get in and out of.  What needs to be tight is your waist strap and crotch strap. These are the most important for underwater stability."
scuba,33jkqf,DoctorHandwaver,2,Thu Apr 23 14:12:57 2015 UTC,Waist strap should not be too tight with twinsets. It impedes arching your back for valve access.  Theres no problem with stability.

scuba,33hj1a,CrimsAK,2,Wed Apr 22 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"Seems like hydroids, or seabather's itch or seabather's eruption. Quite likely the latter if it's itchy and sensitive, might have a little bit of weeping - usually occurs some time after the dive.  Used to get that in Cuba all the time until I started wearing a wetsuit instead of just a t-shirt and shorts. Man I miss how warm that water was."

scuba,33ggfc,phatbrasil,2,Wed Apr 22 12:40:23 2015 UTC,Thanks. My usual preference would be to rent - I tend not to dive unless I'm on holiday - but they charge £45 for the week and the trip only includes a few night dives. You can't hire per day either. It seems I could get something decent for not much more than that and then not have to pay any more rental charges in the future.

I've put it through some punishment and it's still going strong after a few years. The batteries don't last a very long time, but you'll get peak brightness for about 2 hours (it'll go much longer but won't be very bright at all). You won't usually have it constantly turned on unless your on a night dive, so you'll get a lot longer peak. It's worth it for the brightness you do get. Talking £60-70."

I have one, and they're phenomenal.  It's something like a 400 lumen light with 10 hour burn time.  Relatively compact, too."

scuba,33eoyk,ScubaPete,4,Tue Apr 21 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"Any kind of serious training induces bubble formation. The more that you control the parameters of your dive to reduce that bubble formation, the less DCS risk and the less tired you will be.  Be extra careful to make very slow ascents. Especially in the top 10m. A lot of people make it to about 3m and then rocket to the surface like it's no big deal - in reality, you ought to be taking a full minute to ascend that last 3m because that's where the biggest gradient is.  Also, do your safety stops religiously. Doppler stuides show that:   bubbling is reduced significantly by any safety stop on a no-stop dive, even just 2 minutes @ 3m bubbling is reduced even more significantly if you take 1 minute at 6m, then 4 minutes at 3m, ascending no faster than 10m/min.   (Source: Deco for Divers - can't find original because I returned the book to the library)."
scuba,33eoyk,sharkiteuthis,5,Wed Apr 22 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"You're good. Most commercial divers work out between dives, and a working dive is no joke."

Bubble formation does not mean you will get DCS. It does indicate you are at an increased risk.
scuba,33eoyk,Doub1eAA,2,Wed Apr 22 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"So, no one here is a diving doctor as far as I know. If you're conserned about it you can you can wait untill you desaturate when you work out. This could mean doing PT before your first dive of the day. You could dive Nitrox to minimize your desaturation time. Nitrox might also not be a bad idea if you are diving that often! I've always found I'm less tired after diving Nitrox."
scuba,33eoyk,RoHbTC,3,Wed Apr 22 15:31:35 2015 UTC,Lift a few tanks before the dive.
scuba,33eoyk,texasguy911,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"Heavy exercise can increase the risk of bubble formation.  This risk can be partially mitigated by either exercising before diving or having surface interval between your diving and your exercising.  Ideally you would exercise before diving with enough of an interval for your body to return to a resting state.  Alternately, try to exercise 6 hours after diving."
scuba,33eoyk,eanx100,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"I actually tested this quite a bit on myself. I think it depends on a variety of factors including how deep/long the dive was, what your current level of fitness is, how much sleep you got before the dive, and how comfortable you are with diving (less muscle strain and more relaxed movement the more experienced you become). But generally for myself any sort of cardio activity that's more than a jog within an 8 hour window after 2-3 dives results in headaches. Intense cardio will be affected up until the end of the next day, probably at a loss of 20-40% potential if I had to guess.     I would recommend doing some sort of lifting or body weight exercises instead of cardio 24 hours after diving. The headaches I got ranged from being slightly annoying to pounding migraines. I won't be trying that again anytime soon. And that's with safety stops from 50% max depth and 1 min every 10ft/3M up until surface."

scuba,33e00r,N0VA_PR1ME,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:36:00 2015 UTC,I guess my issue is why don't you just look at the water?  The color should give you an idea how the visibility will be while the eddies behind the transom at a mooring/anchor will give a good indication of current.  I just don't see what an ROV would tell you that you couldn't already deduce.
scuba,33e00r,Smellzlikefish,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:40:27 2015 UTC,"This is not always the case at all especially on deeper wrecks.   I mean for shallow stuff, absolutely. You also need to take bottom composition into account.  You would think shit visibility on surface would be shit visibility at depth but often times you have stratification layers of algae, plankton and different currents that don't penetrate at depth.  I've been on wrecks that had less than 3ft (1m) or so visibility at surface open up to 40ft+ (12m) at depth."
scuba,33e00r,macado,3,Wed Apr 22 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"ROVs: http://www.openrov.com/  Are great for discovering new dive sites, especially if they are deep. They are place which you may find some wrecks but you don't know exactly.  Side-scan sonars are the perfect solution. But a cheaper solution is a cheap sonar and an ROV. The you can find irregularities in the bottom and check out with the ROV if it actually a wreck or not."

scuba,33e00r,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"Not regularly no! When there is a prestiguous wreck, there is a lot of funding so this isn't the technique used.  We used this technique some years ago to find some JU-52 wrecks in the Maleme Bay which were sank in the Battle of Crete, Greece.  In the Operation Mercury, was the first airborne assault commenced at dawn, with fleets of Ju-52s roaring over the Cretan coast, disgorging clouds of tired paratroopers while additional soldiers arrived via glider. The initial airdrops were made by a force of 3,000 men under the command of Maj. Gen. Eugen Meindl near Maleme and Canea on Crete's northwest coast. These were followed on the afternoon of the 20th by 2,600 soldiers at Heraklion and 1,500 at Rethymnon. The primitive conditions and murderous anti-aircraft fire over Crete claimed so many of the crucial Ju-52s during the first two days of the attack that the German high command doubted further airdrops were advisable.  So Ju-52 weren't a great find to make it to the news, but it makes a nice dive-site if the depth permits.  We found some (most of them were out of recreational limits), but if you ever visit Chania, Crete, Greece some of the local dive centers can take you to one - two of them which have rested in shallow waters."
scuba,33e00r,hargikas,2,Wed Apr 22 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds amazing. I just got a history boner... I love wrecks, and the more history I know about them the better.  I'm a marine scientist - If I ever make it to Greece I'm going to look you up and bug you until you take me out looking for wrecks. I suspect several bottles of ouzo may be involved :)"

scuba,33e00r,hargikas,3,Thu Apr 23 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"it is a good question.  thinking about it, I guess the value doesn't outweigh the cost. as in, you are already on the boat , in your drysuit  so you might as well go in than send a piece of gear.  but yeah it could be a good tool to use. as other have said, aligned with a depth finder(or sonar) it could be used to scope out new dive sites.

scuba,33e00r,hargikas,3,Thu Apr 23 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Part of the allure of diving is human exploration. ROV's while excellent tools would take the fun out of that. Besides their expense, most prefer to dive themselves especially when the depths are diveable.  Bad vis is bad vis. It sucks but it can be dealt with.  I dive in Boston (New England) which has similar vis.  A collapsed wreck over the winter means sand and debris has been overturned/moved which means new places to look for artifacts."
scuba,33e00r,macado,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think you mean DPV.. Well, they are expensive by themselves (from 1K [used in poor condition] to 6K+). They also require the users to be more physically fit. The battery replacement is about every 2 years and it is from $300 to $2K+ just that. The battery maintenance is also complicated, be it babysitting a fire prone batteries, or just re-charging every 2 months so it would not damage from discharge. How would you feel flooding a $2K battery by accident?  They are a pain in the a$$. They can be fun, people use them. Just get ready to put serious money and your time.  Also, they would require a user to know what to do if the speed switch breaks down, how to safely shut it down while running at full speed. Wrong control movement can bring you to the surface at deadly (aftermath) speeds, same for crashing depths. They are not toys by far. You get strapped to a dumb torpedo.   PS: Propeller -> finger stumps.    If you mean ROV as ROV. Well, why go out of the house at all. Just watch TV all day long. Watch movies about romantic feelings, experience sunsets through Netflix, visit ocean by a Discovery Channel."

scuba,33cnqk,LaserSailor760,5,Tue Apr 21 13:23:16 2015 UTC,BSAC Sports Diver (~PADI AOW/Rescue) has a nice gentle intro to deco diving. Advanced Nitrox/Extended range/Accelerated Deco is the next step which introduces more complex mixes and gas planning.
scuba,33cnqk,jonny_boy27,7,Tue Apr 21 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"In BSAC. It's part and parcel of your training. Sport divers can do decompression dives requiring no more than 20 mins of in water decompression.   Going further, we offer accelated deco procedures (adp) as a skill development course (I think padi call them 'specialtys'). Which allows using rich deco mixes (upto 80% O2). And even trimix courses which allow dives to 80m.   I think what your asking stems from PADI being more recreational diving orientated club. BSAC has slowly grown on technical diving and now offers some courses for them, but no where near as comprehensive as a proper techie school.   If you are serious about doing deco. Get the training first and foremost. And gain your experience gradually. Don't do a 20m 'simulated' deco dive then think it's OK to do a 40m with long deco dive... It requires lots of planning, consideration of possibly carrying a redundant gas supply and of course... Planning the dive and diving the plan.   If you want deep long deco dives some of the technical clubs (IANTD ETC.) may be able to offer you more than BSAC and PADI..."
scuba,33cnqk,w3s7y,13,Tue Apr 21 17:36:13 2015 UTC,"Are they simply following their computer for the most part?    Absolutely not. Diving to 200 feet is already pretty extreme. 300 or 400 feet requires extensive training, gear, and surface support.  Decompression dives are planned very accurately. We calculate the decompression schedule, the gas requirements, match our gas requirements with our dive buddy, and so on and so forth. We generate custom dive tables and use a bottom timer to perform the dive. Even when we have computers- they're only a backup.  There are numerous agencies that offer technical training- TDI, IANTD, PADI, BSAC, and so on. Find a good instructor with a lot of experience and use them. The specific agency doesn't matter."

scuba,33cnqk,Badekar,5,Tue Apr 21 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming 30 minutes bottom time at 120 meters (~400 feet): Total deco time 269 minutes (4.5 hours).

scuba,33cnqk,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"The twin-CCR profiles I'm thinking of are your 7-hour runtime cave dives (the Plura incident comes to mind) - rare even in tech diving.  And what's in those bailout cylinders? If you have a loop flood, one of them needs to be safe to breathe at 100m, so either 15/55 if you're comfortable pushing right up against a 1.6 ppO2 and want to shorten your bailout deco, or 12/65 if you want to be more conservative regarding acute oxtox, but add deco time? Then maybe 35/25 in the other one, or even 50%, depending on what the dive planner gives you for your shortest bailout time.  Do you have an SMB you can shoot that signals the boat to drop the spare O2 tank on a line at 6m? Otherwise those shallow stops are going to take forever to clear.  I'm assuming in a true bailout scenario you've got the GF in your  computer set to 100/100.  I'm curious about the logistics. I know a lot about decompression theory, and very little about decompression practice beyond the very basics of OC to 50m with a single deco gas."
scuba,33cnqk,nigelh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"7 hours is way out of my league. I'm just a recreational diver who has extended his range into deeper wrecks over the years and let his background in industrial physics control his planning.  I have a little card I made up which gives me time for depth for my two sets of bailouts. These are the 18/40 and 100% in the 7L steels that I actually use to top off the CCR on a weekend trip and the 12/65 and 50% in the 12L/300bars. The card is used as a planner. The rebreather is loaded with the same gas as the deep bailout. The chart gives me times for no-stop, 5 minutes of stops and for maxing out at least one of the bailout cylinders. It is cut on a SAC of 18L/min and 100/100GF so it is worst case. How close to those numbers I plan to go is a decision I make on the day. I dive on two computers - the idea being that normally I do the stops to not bend either and then maybe some more as a safety margin. If it all goes wrong the plan is to try to not bend one of them. I have done a practice full bailout from 55 meters back to the surface but that didn't start with a sudden mouthful of seawater and a panic so having quite a bit of gas left after that isn't something I'd rely on.  I'm not sure I would recommend this approach to anybody else but it puts a cap on my bottom times as, let us say, survivable. I have only had to bail out for real once and that was at about 18 meters/no stop but that was scrubber breakthrough and was really scary (and my fault). Yes, I carry a yellow blob that I can put as a rider on my main line and I am the guy in our group that brings the 12 of 50% with the rigging kit because most boats don't have it."
scuba,33cnqk,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"This all makes sense to me - was 18L/min chosen as double your normal SAC? That seems a bit low for ""panic SAC"" - though I suppose the hope is that once you don't have a mouthful of seawater and scrubber sludge and you're on your bailout cylinder, you can get your buoyancy back under control and get much closer to your actual deco SAC as you can resume normal breathing and calm down.  Smart to have 12/65 in the bailout when you're diving 18/40 as dil - loss of buoyancy with a full flood seems like it could easily put you in oxtox territory in the time it takes you to get on the bailout cylinder.  Are the bailout cylinders completely independent regs, with the second stages stowed like a stage bottle?"
scuba,33cnqk,nigelh,2,Tue Apr 28 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"18L/min is just a bit up on what I normally do OC. 12/300 is a huge amount of gas, you might start panicked but you'll be just normal bored before you're down to 200bar.  No, the 12/65 bailout is used with the 12/65 dil (unless I've used most of the 18/40 topping up the CCR).  Rig? Grabs camera. Here's a picture.  5 foot sharing friendly hose, magnetic clip (any pull gets it but they rust horribly), 2Kg weight to keep it neutral on a QR 'belt' (discard that and it's buoyant so clip it to the DSMB line and it slides up), big size p-clips to go on chest and waist D-rings, optional wing and suit inflates. The Vince Harlow Voodoo Gas sticker and the contents label on the other side. Quite nice in the water but a bit of a pig to handle on the boat. The carbon fibre wound tank weighs just under 11Kgs so it is massively lighter than any steel or Ali of that capacity but still is a problem to handle."

Once you decide if that is really the way you want to go, you can decide which route to take - whether it be continuing with PADI or switching to TDI or the like."

scuba,33cnqk,Aienan,5,Tue Apr 21 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Nope.  You do not need to be a Divemaster to take any of the PADI Tec Rec courses, unless by Divemaster you mean Advanced Open Water Diver.  FYI ...  TEC 40 requirements are that you must ...   A PADI Advanced Open Water Diver A PADI Enriched Air Diver with at least 10 dives using enriched air deeper than 18 metres/60 feet A PADI Deep Diver with at least 10 dives to 30 metres/100 feet At least 18 years old and have a minimum of 30 logged dives   The TEC 40 class is actually great to give a diver an idea of what they are in for in Technical Diving without having to commit. You could do it with minimal equipment rentals and know it is something you want before you invest completely.  Nothing wrong with TDI, or even GUE - though GUE is not my particular flavour of Koolaid - but their courses are not designed for a preview - while the PADI Tec 40 is really good for that."

scuba,33cnqk,TacoExcellence,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:10:32 2015 UTC,rec trimix isn't a tech course though. it doesn't cover deco and is solely aimed at getting people into trimix for diving within recreational limits.

scuba,33cnqk,TacoExcellence,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:34:38 2015 UTC,"i was mainly pointing out that tec40 and rec trimix do not cover the same material as decompression is not covered with rec trimix. rec trimix is more comparable to deep diver.  in the grand scheme of things, 130 ft isn't really that deep. lots of people dive to 100 to 130 ft at some point. deep diver covers till 130ft and you can take that without AOW if i understand correctly."
scuba,33cnqk,runsongas,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:17:20 2015 UTC,Is decompression planning that much more advanced then? I'm not really familiar with the sorts of things these courses cover.
scuba,33cnqk,CanadianDiver,2,Wed Apr 22 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"depends on the type of diving you are already doing. if you are diving rule of thirds with redundancy already, it wouldn't be as big a leap.  if you are used to following around a dm without even knowing your NDL remaining then it would be more of a jump."
scuba,33cnqk,ponyboy3,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:54:21 2015 UTC,"You can take the Tec 40 course with at least 30 dives ... this course limits your deco and it is also limited to 50% O2, but it is a good start...  The next level is 50 dives minimum and after that it is 100 dives...  Even 100 dives is not a lot, but it is also enough to become an instructor ...  Opinions on minimum qualifications aside, the Tec 40 class is a good introduction to technical diving."
scuba,33cnqk,CanadianDiver,-1,Wed Apr 22 00:03:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was sure that they wanted dive master. Did this change recently? I was definitely wrong.
scuba,33cnqk,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Originally, the PADI Tec Rec program was really two courses ... Deep Diving and Trimix Diving ... I am not certain what the requirements were for Deep Diving.  A few years ago they broke the course into parts Tec 40, 45, 50 and Trimix 65 ... which honestly I think was a good idea.  The Tec 40 course is really an intro to tech diving ... you learn about equipment configurations and how to properly sling a deco bottle but are limited to very limited deco (off the top of my head, I think it is 10 minutes) and also limited to 50% O2.  This introduces a diver to proper dive and more importantly proper gas planning without going full tilt into technical diving. It lets them see what is really involved in going tech so to speak."
scuba,33cnqk,CanadianDiver,3,Wed Apr 22 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"Choose the instructor, not the agency. If you have no way at all to vet the instructor, GUE or UTD is a safe bet because their instructor standards are extremely high (though, as you pointed out, quite pricey - not that tec diving is ever not pricey, much to my wife's chagrin).  That said, I would also agree to steer clear of PADI (just on general principle) unless the instructor is very good and just happens to teach certain courses through PADI.  Though /u/CanadianDiver does have a good point about Tec 40 being a good way to see if deco diving is for before you commit (although personally, the idea of renting equipment for technical diving makes me very uneasy). That said, if you're on the fence about tec diving... it's probably not for you. There's either stuff down there that makes the risk of deco dives worthwhile to you, or there isn't."
scuba,33cnqk,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"The problem with going tec, is that it is truly a fundamental change for a recreational diver. There is a significant amount of equipment required:   namely doubles (though side mount will likely become more the norm)  plus a stage bottle  2 more sets of regs  for many divers it may mean a new computer (not getting into the debate about whether a computer is necessary as my inbox is still bruised from last time!) possibly changing from a BCD to BP/W   Signing up for a full tec course means renting all this gear is impractical and costly, whereas renting this equipment for a shorter course like the Tec 40 gives divers a taste of what it is like before they invest."
scuba,33cnqk,CanadianDiver,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"Sidemount is definitely pushed heavily by the PADI Tec Rec people, for whatever reason.  Believe me, I know exactly how expensive it is. I have a spreadsheet showing how much money I've spent moving from rec into tec - and I started diving knowing that I would be going down the tec path, so I bought BP/W, cold water regs, computer, etc with that in mind.   I don't show that spreadsheet to my wife. And I was buying good-quality used stuff, getting great deals, doing a ton of work on the gear myself when it was safe...  I'm just deeply skeptical of rental gear on the whole, and particularly in an overhead environment.  (I see both sides of the computer debate, FWIW, and haven't squarely picked a side. Some people cough DIR cough approach it with a religious fervor. I dive DWW - doing what works. A lot of it is DIR, but I'd have to make a few changes for a Fundies class.)"

scuba,33cnqk,PostPostModernism,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"Your first step if you want to go down that road should probably be getting your Advanced Open Water and include the deep diver training in it (I'm not sure if that's a required one or not).  That will teach you the basics so you can go down to 120' safely and plan deco stops for that.  With those basics under your belt, stepping into more specialized diving like others in this thread have talked about should be easier.    And while a lot of people use computers, I think everyone who takes deep diving seriously is also going to be well trained in running those numbers themselves, too.  If your computer dies mid-dive, you need to have a backup plan and be able to make a new plan as situations change.    I'm PADI AOW certified myself, including the deep specialty, and it's a lot of fun!  I've done 3 deep dives (more than 60') so far.

Two of them have to be Deep Dive 1 and Underwater Navigation 1.  For the OP, I would recommend Wreck, Enriched Air and Night as your other choices. Once you have completed your AOW you can then do the other dives on the Speciality courses and will have a good understanding of the practicalities involved.  Technical Diving is more complex because you need to take a lot more gear with you (two of everything so you can deal with gear failure), understand Decompression Diving (all recreational scuba is non-decompression diving), truly know about gas mixes (you can't breathe the same gas at 100m that you can at the surface, and vice versa), and be comfortable in low-light and no-light environments (sunlight isn't very bright at those depths).  Once you have done those Specialities, look at the Rescue Diver course (it's a lot of fun, you get to ""drown"" your friends) and also look at the Drysuit diver if you don't already have it, it gets cold down there.

More focused on free-diving than SCUBA but very well written and an absolute must for wacky characters and great insight into marine biology and human connections to the ocean.  Also recommend Shadow Divers. Very little on marine biology but fascinating history lesson though the eyes (or masks) of divers. Could/should be a movie.  Currently reading Caverns Measureless to Man by Sheck Exley. Fun/inspiring look at a real master.

They might have retired it, seeing as it's not on their site anymore.  Looking through the dive log, there was such a huge amount of sea life - sharks, rays, turtles, huge schools of barracuda, mantis shrimps, pipefish, octopi, squids, cuttlefish, sea horses, giant clams...  And the dive where we just hung around near the sand and watched about 10-15 manta rays soar about in the water nearby the whole time. That was nice.

I'm sure you'll have just as much luck as long as you measure yourself carefully.  They were great, more than happy to spend an hour showing me round. It was great to see how the shits were out together and they were able to explain all the options to tailor the suit to my needs.  In terms of the suit itself, I have nova with a few extras (zip cover, pocket (the large zipped are much better than the bellows pocket) name badge). I also got a made to measure under suit. All for under £650.  I have absolutely no complaints. No leaks 100 dives in. Good quality material and workmanship. Suit stands up fine when compared to those that cost twice the price.   Others in my club are also happy with them. Plenty of divers in the UK use them in relatively tough conditions so I wouldn't be too worried.

However that takes you down another tissue saturation code which means a better second dive with even less deco stops.  I'd say 30 minutes is too short though. You're not giving the body a chance to scrub away bubbles at that rate."
scuba,337174,kevski82,2,Mon Apr 20 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"In general, changes to the PADI tables some years ago to change from a 12 minute to a 60 minute controling compartment resulted in The minimized SI's dropping from hour+ down to 45 minutes.  Personally, I still like to have an hour out.  But do keep in mind that for the OP, the first dive was less than an hour and since it was on Nitrox, it's equivalent air depth was barely 30fsw.  That's not much of a tissue load at all - and as per my ancient PADI table, they would have had to have stayed down for an additional 250 minutes to risk going into deco...as such, the first dive's profile could have been repeated five more times before we really need to worry."

They were probably not familiar with the dive site and relied upon the divemaster to be half reasonable."

scuba,333h80,Announcementguy,3,Sun Apr 19 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"The dive master certainly screwed when he didn't realize there was a problem when the 'experienced' underwater camera crew showed up without computers.  Right then he should have known things were wrong. But, in his defense, 5 divers left the boat and a buddy team of two divers returned to the boat. From his perspective, the remaining dive group was 3 people.  The two divers who returned to the boat and then left on their own without a diver master were now diving their own plan. They are OW certified, unless the could actually still see the group, all the responsibility from that point forward is on their own shoulders. They were 80% or more responsible for the tragedy."
scuba,333h80,Ski1990,3,Sun Apr 19 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"That would not be a fair assessment given the facts of the case. For one, this was not a regular dive, but a working dive. As a result, the divemaster was in charge of safety for the group, regardless of each individuals certification level (i.e.: he was the safety lead).  As a result, leaving the descent site to go swim with some sea life while some divers are still on their descent (and evidently not in sight) is negligent (bare minimum, no pun intended).  Likewise, not informing the divers what their breathing mix was, and making sure they know what it actually means, is negligence in his duties as safety lead (not divemaster, as that isn't the divemaster's job really, but it is the safety lead's).  Likewise, not establishing a dive plan, and making sure each computer is set for the dive plan (MOD considerations, profiles, units, etc.) is negligence of safety lead and divemaster duties.  Likewise, incorrectly setting the dive computers for their nitrox mixes is plain negligence: either don't do it and force the diver to do it and then check it (perfectly fine) or do it right. Doing it wrong is just negligent.  Yes, the OW divers should have spoken up, you're absolutely right. But it wasn't their job do so legally, it was the safety lead's job to check that everything was okay, and the divemaster's job to make sure it all went according to the plan laid out. By and large, the OW divers did fantastically well considering the circumstances. They did a buddy ascent, sharing air, evaluated their options when they ran out of air, and bolted for the surface when they saw the alternative. Everything they did in the water was right, as opposed to how the divemaster acted in the water (ditching them)."

However, in-water recompression has its own dangers and should not be attempted without the necessary training and equipment, or in the absence of someone who can assess the diver medically."""
scuba,333h80,MasherusPrime,6,Sun Apr 19 08:34:50 2015 UTC,"In-Water Recompression Tables Check out the times someone has to be in the water in various in-water recompression procedure.  Does the boat - dive center has oxygen or air for that many hours?  Can a diver be insulated and safe for that many hours underwater?  Do you have the equipment to make an IWR? Some equipment could be:   a means of securely holding the casualty at a measured depth, such as a harness and 20 metre line with a 20 kg lead weight at the bottom and 40 litre buoy at the top a means of allowing the casualty to ascend slowly, such as loops in the line to which the harness could be clipped full face diving masks for the casualty and for an in-water tending diver including two-way communication to the surface and an umbilical gas supply surface supplied breathing gases including pure oxygen and air delivered to the casualty by umbilical voice communications equipment to the divers use IWR treatment ""table""   It is really difficult, that will most probably something will go wrong!  If there is a recompression chamber somewhere that the victim can be transferred, the method should be 100% oxygen and transfer to the recompression chambers.  At the first sign or symptom, the patient should immediately be placed on 100% oxygen… via demand mask. You need to get the patient oxygenated. The therapeutic effects of 100% oxygen to a DCI victim cannot be overstated. In a significant number of cases, immediate oxygen breathing will arrest symptom progression and achieve relief without the need for recompression. But the key word here is “immediate”. Every minute lost allows for more inert gas bubbles to form and aggregate. By flooding the victim with 100% oxygen and eliminating any further intake of nitrogen from atmospheric air, you are creating a gradient for bubble size reduction and elimination. Cross your fingers and hope the victim begins recovery. You should be trained in field neurological exams and go through the checklist as soon as the diver suggests they may have DCI. If you're lucky, they may have dodged a bullet.  If demanding or technical diving is taken place in a remote place where the recompression facilities are many hours or days away, then the best solution is portable recompression chamber in the boat. For example: http://www.hyperlite.co.uk/"

scuba,333h80,hargikas,3,Sun Apr 19 08:13:25 2015 UTC,"Yea it works, just as a recompression chamber works.   The reason it is discouraged is because you need a sling for the victim, lots of o2 (more than many boats have), full face mask, thermal protection, and at least a couple of trained tenders.  Most people have access to a chamber, but in cases of being a day or more away from a chamber, and with the right equipment, I would try in water recompression."
scuba,333h80,Kevinnnnn,4,Sun Apr 19 08:29:01 2015 UTC,No. All of my training and talking to divemasters in my family who lead tours in the summer say this is never an option.   Edit: I'll expand on my comment a bit. If you look at treatments for DCS it involves pressures and depths and more importantly times that can't be achieved by simply getting back in the water. If you try to fix it by going back down you risk making the problem much much worse and creating an emergency situation at depth.   NEVER EVER DO THIS.
scuba,333h80,lookatmycamels,8,Sun Apr 19 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"Never do this without the appropriate training or if there is a viable alternative. There are absolutely cases where it is applicable and the correct choice, but it shouldn't be done without training."

(preface, obviously the best recourse here is to not put yourself in this situation to begin with, but humor me)  If I've just blown my depth profile due to faulty equipment, and had to do an emergency ascent from 150', I get back on the boat, but the captain doesn't speak my language and wants to wait for the rest of the divers, I start to feel severe DCS symptoms, why would I not go back in the water?  I should just twiddle my thumbs on the deck and wait to be unconscious, when throwing on a tank and going to 20' would possibly prevent a lifetime of brain damage?

scuba,333h80,Super_Natant,0,Sun Apr 19 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"Because without proper training you risk making the situation much worse. My training and the training of every divemaster I know is that you don't use going back into the water. You take oxygen and you get to a deco chamber.   Your scenario is NOT going to happen. No captain is suddenly going to be like ""welp I have a sick passenger, better just hang around. Any competent dive shop is going to understand you saying DCS, bends, emergency, oxygen. And really... you shouldn't be diving with them if they speak literally no common words between you.   What would happen in reality is the captain starts you on oxygen, they bang on the boat or use whatever signal they've worked out with their divemasters, everyone ascends and you gtfo and they take you to deco.   You do NOT go back in the water.   Edit: For emphasis I'm going to edit and say you do NOT make the decision yourself to get back in the water. It goes against all DAN and PADI training and you can kill yourself or create an extreme emergency.   100% oxygen on a demand mask and getting to a hospital IS the treatment for DCS.   The ONLY acceptable time for in water recompression is if you are on a dive so remote that waiting for treatment will kill whoever got bent and even then you have to have specialized training to perform in-water deco and you have to have special equipment because proper in-water deco requires that you keep getting oxygen while you're at depth. And then it is only ONLY used in the most extreme cases where there is literally no other option available.   You DO NOT GET BACK IN THE WATER.   Double Edit: Just in the scenario you mentioned so many things would have to go wrong. You're at 150 feet? That's 45 meters. You're 5 meters past the maximum allowable depth for recreational diving to start. Which means you weren't paying attention, your dive buddy wasn't paying attention and your dive master wasn't paying attention... and then you panic and shoot to the surface. If all of that has happened you're so poorly trained that you shouldn't be diving in the first place. If you're in that situation your dive computer is going to be screaming at you to ascend because you risk oxygen toxicity and blacking out.   You ascend to above 40 meters and then follow your dive computers instructions on the way up. And if you say ""but what if I don't have a dive computer"". There's no excuse. This is the 21st century. If you can't afford one... rent one. They're like $5 to rent and they can save your life. The shop I go diving with won't even allow you on their dive if you don't have a working dive computer and some form of a backup (like a dive watch) with you."

I mean, that literally happened in this very scenario.  You're envisioning a scenario where everything (except the blown dive profile) goes exactly to plan.  What if there is no oxygen?  What if there is no hospital (as is very common in remote Pacific sites)?  What if there is no ready decompression chamber?  What if (as in this case) the captain can't communicate properly?  Your (rather alpha, offputting) dogmatic answer doesn't really take any of this into account.  To say something like ""in reality...."" is not taking into account actual reality, where a ton of things can go wrong simultaneously...  Are you familiar with the story of Richard Pyle?  He did in-water recompression because the hospital recompression chamber was nowhere close to being ready for him.

The KISS bottom line is that when diving in locations where there simply is no chamber, then IWR has to be a consideration as an alternative.  True, it's not a great one, but if we go waaaaaaaay back in dive history, if the diver can get onto his required deco schedule  within 10 minutes, the early dive tables attitude was ""No big deal"".  Granted, this was for running across the deck to a shipboard chamber, but the point remains basically the same:  you don't die instantly and it is very well known that recompression does nix symptoms (which has a scientific basis to it), as do also the observations that convulsions are due to OxTox, which isn't a major risk with a tank of 21% or even 32% being used as an ad hoc IWR."
scuba,333h80,-hh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:05:59 2015 UTC,That's not what DAN recommends without special equipment and training.   Yes it can be used in extreme extreme scenarios but even then only with specific training and equipment.

One case or two cases where someone did something and it worked doesn't mean it's what YOU should do.   You're going to make the situation worse by thinking you are the 1 case out of 1,000.

One case or two cases where someone did something and it worked doesn't mean it's what YOU should do.   I'm not suggesting that he's wrong, or that DAN/PADI are wrong, and my point isn't necessarily that IWD should be or is standard protocol, but that one should be prepared for any situation.    If I'm in the Pacific, suffering from severe DCS after aborting a dive, miles from any chamber or hospital, with a deaf blind captain, or other weird extenuating circumstance, ""You shouldn't have done that"" isn't exactly useful advice, is it?  He even said, it might be worth it in some .00001% of situations, and wasn't the situation in question here one such situation?"
scuba,333h80,Super_Natant,2,Sun Apr 19 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, let me give you a non-dogmatic answer, as I'm a proponent of in-water decompression in certain select circumstances: the process requires four very specific things.  1) a very large supply of pure oxygen (enough for a person to breath for more than three hours while in pain with a high respiration rate, so probably something like 6xAL80).  2) it requires a tender to perform the procedure, since at any point the patient can pass out, start convulsing, freaking out, etc.   3) it requires a full face mask for the patient. Again, they may be unconscious, convulsing, in pain, whatever, and you can't be assured they'll keep their regulator in. Also the tender should have one, with comms to the surface, although he could get by without one.  4) it requires a weighted line marked at one foot intervals, ideally with loops to attach the patient to. The ascent profile in these procedures is extremely slow, and you can't just wing it.  If he had had all that gear on the boat, since the deco facility was not insanely far, the prescribed procedure would have been to take the large amount of oxygen and put both patients on it while keeping them on the boat. It would be safer, since they would have more than enough pure oxygen to make it to the facility. The only time you would do in-water is if you know for a fact your O2 won't last long enough to get you to shore, and that the extra risk of in-water is lower than the extra risk of the amount of time off of O2 until they would get to shore. This is a very very specific set of circumstances that doesn't occur often."
scuba,333h80,ahugenerd,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:31:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting the entire decompression be done underwater, I'm more thinking 10-20 minutes while you wait for the chamber to be ready, or the DM (as in this case) to return.  15 minutes at 15 feet, with a buddy, seems a lot less risky to me, health-wise, than 15 minutes guaranteed of giant nitrogen bubbles blocking every neuromuscular junction in my body while we twiddle our thumbs and wait for Dingleberry the DM to come back from the reef...   edit: but thanks for the non-douchey answer, I appreciate it."
scuba,333h80,Super_Natant,3,Sun Apr 19 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"There are tables for in-water recompression and decompression, and they have to be followed pretty carefully or you could make the problem worse. There are a few different ones, and they basically all hinge on how long it takes the patient to feel better, but even the fastest, best case, will take at least 60 minutes, more likely 90.  While going back down you wait for the DM might seem like a good idea, it's discounting the fact that you could go into CNS toxic shock, pass out, freak out, what have you, while at depth. Those are all fatal at depth without a tender. They are not fatal on the boat. That's the difference."
scuba,333h80,ahugenerd,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"FYI, there's been other cases too.

scuba,333h80,texasguy911,2,Sun Apr 19 14:12:11 2015 UTC,How did the oxygen toxicity not kill him at 200  feet on 32 percent?
scuba,333h80,jdb888,2,Tue Apr 21 23:11:49 2015 UTC,There are 2 types of oxygen toxicity. CNS and pulmonary. What divers are trained is that CNS toxicity can occur in any moment after 1.6 pp02. That is way to keep divers safe. In chambers a victim can go up to 3pp02 without CNS toxicity killing him. So you can understand it is something (convulsions) that happens after 1.6 pp02 in ambiguous time. So for the safe diver this time is 0 minutes.

But seriously - not dived with Emperor in the Maldives but the boat looks fine. Only couple of points about diving in the Maldives:  There can be a lot of current.  I found mu split fins sometimes didn't cut it first time I went - much better with my Mares Quatros.  Many boats will allow you to use Reef hooks - worth taking one.  Several dive sites we were able to hook onto rocks (NOT CORAL!) in strong currents.  The strong currents often attract big wildlife, but finning against would chew through your air.  Also - take an SMB and use it at every safety interval.  Again strong currents can push you a long way away from the boat.  Finally for all liveaboards i recommend taking nappy sacks.  You can't flush paper down the toilets - and put them in a bin beside the toilet.  Placing the used toilet paper in nappy bags makes the bathroom a much nicer place - they're made to keep to stench in..."

Im quite used to currents as most of my dives have been at the Aliwal Shoal in South Africa which is a reef 5km off the coast and has screaming currents.

I would buy the Bullet skin instead, given the option, the pockets on the Tech skin are kind of stupid, I'm going to modify mine to make them easier to use in dry gloves.  Not having a p-valve pre-installed is a bummer, but most suits in that price range don't. It's a mildly expensive install (or mildly complicated, depending on how inclined you are to modify your own gear - I opted for the latter)."
scuba,3330u7,sharkiteuthis,2,Sun Apr 19 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"My budget is such that I can't go straight to the Bullet now, but I like that I could upgrade to that skin later when the budget allows.

scuba,3330u7,sharkiteuthis,2,Sun Apr 19 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"They can be fixed up to be significantly better with a little ingenuity.

scuba,3330u7,DoctorHandwaver,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"The size of the pockets is acceptable, but the neoprene used in theire construction is super floppy and nearly impossible to feel with dry gloves or even thin neoprene.  It's areally a pain in the butt.  Plus, they don't haveany tethers built in to clip your stuff off to, so it's easy to have a yard sale. I am going to use some ripstop nylon and sew in some thin plastic bars (probably using old credit cards or something comparable) top tabs of the pockets.    Probably wont be perfect, but definitely an improvement.  I have a bullet too, the pockets are much better but it takes forever (like 3-4 days) to dry and it is bulky to pack. I like the fusion plenty, it dives great, but my next suit will probably be a Santi.

I bought the suit with those restrictions - and I'm very satisfied! I probably would do the same again.   Also, i think the boys need to wear more pantyhose. I beat them every time!"

I regularly dive in water that is anywhere between 35F and 45F, and I didn't find it comfortable and didn't find it all that warm, even with the jacket.  I saw another diver with the Thermal Fusion - not the MK3 and I loved the look of and bought a set ... It is SO MUCH WARMER! and at the same time, it it is top entry like the Fusion dry suit itself, so you can open the top while you sit on the boat without having to take your suit off, just unzip the suit and unzip the undies...  I haven't touched my MK2 in three years..."

It looks like it's just a better MK3 (same weight, I think).  I have yet to see if the MK2 will be toasty enough with my mildly thick wicking base layer on hour+ dives in 40F water, but the MK3 is without a doubt.  I can unzip the front and the sleeves and get some decent airflow, but yeah, overall that Thermal Fusion looks like a winner. I wonder if I can find someplace to rent me one to try out. I'll probably have all the same problems as with the MK3, though (have to add way too much weight and dive with too much squeeze).  The MK3 has been relegated to ""I'm going to be spending three hours in cold water"" territory.  I'm also a human furnace, though, as my partners will attest. Only my hands and feet really ever get cold."

I ended up needing 26lbs (!!) on my belt, and even at 700 psi, once I hit about 8' I couldn't stop myself from floating to the surface.

There are a few (well-known) tech divers who swear by them.  Make of that what you will. It definitely has an steeper ([i.e. in the literal sense of easy to get more proficient with less experience) learning curve than an off-the-shelf suit from another brand because the skin really helps control the bubble.

You look a little like you're in Star Trek (and I got a red one, of course). I'm in the same position as you. Light tech, mostly leadership/rec.   Plus, the neoprene provides a little insulation. Thinner undergarments may be allowed.   No P-Valve, and the oval cuffs (I have the Fusion Bullet) are a little bit clunky because they're the hard wrist rings. But you get caught on the valve any way. It's a great suit. I'm about to install my P-Valve once I get it... Kinda nervous since it's a big bag. But I should be fine.   Enjoy your Whites! :D"

scuba,3330u7,sharkiteuthis,2,Tue Apr 21 23:28:53 2015 UTC,The round ring system gets in the way and is a pain in the ass. The oval rings are much nicer. Find out which one it has.  The Whites 300g undergarment has an inner layer and and outer layer and they weren't sewn together enough so it moves around when trying to put it on.  The shoulder entry can be done by yourself- but realistically you need another person to help get it on sometimes.  You'll need to add a P-valve if you want one.  It's a little tougher to get on than a shell suit- I end up using more room on the boat than my buddy with his Santi.  That said- it dives beautifully and its relatively inexpensive for a dry suit.
scuba,3330u7,sharkiteuthis,2,Sun Apr 19 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"The round ring system gets in the way and is a pain in the ass. The oval rings are much nicer. Find out which one it has.   The oval one doesn't fit large hands, FYI. DRIS has the measurements. In retrospect, I wish I'd gone with the ovals, but I wasn't sure I could use them with the simple pullover dry gloves I like.  Any ring system makes getting my bungee mount compass and computer on a minor pain.   The Whites 300g undergarment has an inner layer and and outer layer and they weren't sewn together enough so it moves around when trying to put it on.   Yeah, this was annoying. And the foot stirrups aren't tight enough to actually work as intended, so you get bunched up at the ankles. And it's thick as f*ck, which makes just getting into the suit a huge pain if you have even reasonably broad shoulders.  I dove the MK3 for the first time today, and it's insanely positive - I needed extra weight (like, 20lbs) with doubled LP125's, and I'm a sinker, which made the buoyancy swing really unpleasant since I don't have a V-weight. On the plus side, I wasn't even the tiniest bit cold.  I'm going to dive the MK2 tomorrow in the same conditions. With a wicking base layer I think it will be fine for repetitive hour-long dives in 41F water. I'm saving the MK3 for long, deep dives, or actual ice dives."

In retrospect, I wish I'd gone with the ovals, but I wasn't sure I could use them with the simple pullover dry gloves I like.   I had mine switched to the ovals and it was a LOT more comfortable. I was doing cave dives in it and without gloves- those rings dug into the back of my hand. I didn't notice a huge difference in the size of the hand that would fit- but honestly I didn't look that closely. I have large hands but not outrageously so.   Yeah, this was annoying. And the foot stirrups aren't tight enough to actually work as intended, so you get bunched up at the ankles. And it's thick as f*ck, which makes just getting into the suit a huge pain if you have even reasonably broad shoulders.   Yep- spot on about the stirrups as well. One of the reasons it takes longer to get the suit on is because you're right- it bunches up around the ankles and calves.  It is warm as all hell though and I'd rather be warm than cold so I use it even for dives in 50 degree water. I just wish they'd sew the layers together and improve the stirrups- then it would be great."
scuba,3330u7,stds9tng,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:23:47 2015 UTC,"If I could do it over again, I would do the ovals, if only to make reaching int bug holes easier. My hands just barely fit without any contorting according the the DRIS measurements, and I don't have particularly large hands, so I think they may be large in practice since you can sort of squeeze your hand through.  I'm 90% certain the pullover gloves still work fine with the ovals. However, I just spent $400 and countless hours of my time (not to mention brain cells lost to aquaseal fumes) retrofitting the round rings on a 2009 Tech, so I'm not about to switch them up without a really compelling reason.   Yep- spot on about the stirrups as well. One of the reasons it takes longer to get the suit on is because you're right- it bunches up around the ankles and calves.   Yeah, you basically have to roll the entire leg up and almost turn the foot pocket inside out to get a good fit without bunching, and then it takes forever to get your leg all the way in the bunched up leg because of the damn skin and the fact that you consistently forgot to take your wetnotes and backup mask and your reel and SMB out of the pockets... So now you're sweating your balls off because you're sitting (hopefully in the shade) in 80+ degree heat wearing what amounts to a heavy winter jacket, and you have to decide if you want to chug a half gallon of water and go ahead and plumb up the p-valve, or just take a few small sips and be dehydrated. My personal preference is swiftly becoming, always plumb up the p-valve. It's worth it even quarry diving because getting halfway into and out of the drysuit to piss is such a pain, and involves a long walk in the sun.  Aren't drysuits fun? Still, I wouldn't go back to diving wet.  To be fair, that last part isn't entirely and issue with Whites, it's just a little worse with Whites suits because the outer skin is only anchored at the wrists, ankles, and neck.    It is warm as all hell though and I'd rather be warm than cold so I use it even for dives in 50 degree water. I just wish they'd sew the layers together and improve the stirrups- then it would be great.   I won't dive the MK3 anymore unless I know I'm spending 90+ minutes in 40F water. I dove the MK2 today in 41F water for two 20 minute dives that were nearly back to back and only 60F air temps plus wind and spray (small boat dives to look for lost anchors), and wasn't the least bit cold. (My feet on the other hand... I layered lavacore socks under my normal wool socks today because my feet were cold yesterday, but that made my Chuck Taylors too small - so my feet were squeezed before I even got in the water.)  Plus, with the MK3, I need a stupid amount of weight to start sinking, even with twin LP125s. I'm good once I hit 10 feet and the squeeze sets in, but I have to be really careful to only have just enough air in the suit to reach my valves and keep a little air in my feet for warmth and trim. I have very little control over my buoyancy in the top 10 feet - there's just too much air trapped in too many places. I actually end up warmer in the MK2 because I feel more comfortable diving with a bigger bubble so the underwear can actually do it's job.  What tanks and backplate are you diving - do you find you need a ton of weight with your MK3?"

scuba,3329a8,richiericardo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"As a large-sized (and perhaps overly picky) scuba instructor living on Oahu, I recently couldn't even find find something on the island to even try on in a style that I was looking for (Mares jacket style.)  The shops I am familiar with on the island have a limited selection of BCDs besides what could be considered rental stock and the like.  My advice would be to look around online if you are familiar with what you would like and then check if there is a dealer on the island and pay them a visit.  If you don't know what you'd like perhaps just go shop around and try a few things on, with the notion that you might find a better range or products and prices online.    Edit: at the end of the day, it really just comes down to minor differences/preferences within a bcd bladder type (d-rings, pockets, inflator shape).  I  used everything from Tusa XL to S out of necessity and could barely tell a difference in functionality.  Divers seem to be a bunch that like to stick with what they know in terms of gear, so if you know what's worked for you in the past, start your search with similar items.    To answer your question directly I'd say Aarons seemed to have the best variety of stock I've seen on the island when I was looking around (although still not awe inspiring.) The guys at Aloha are also pretty nice .  In terms of Honolulu proper, Honolulu Scuba Company is the only B&M operation I'm familiar with, and they just had basic rental stock last time I was in.  Actually I've been to Sunshine too, and while they were very helpful, their selection was also very sparse.    Hope I've been in some way helpful."

scuba,32zrng,mblitch,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"HECK YES BROTHER!!!      Take time to figure out your weighting. Especially if you are not diving in a drysuit.  Doubles add a lot of weight on their own and you don't want to become an anchor.  I've only dove doubles a few times, so if you have questions on weighting come back here and i'm sure there are plenty of experienced doubles divers willing to chime in, or look around for a Doubles primer course for education on weighting, gas mgmt and ideally how to properly perform a valve drill (Very important in case of a failure)  Is this also your first back plate and wing?"
scuba,32zrng,nigelh,2,Mon Apr 20 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"OK. Doubles and weighting. You have about 6Kgs of gas in them so you want enough weight on your belt to hold a stop with them EMPTY. No, not a 50bar reserve or something but EMPTY. Without that a total gas loss means you can't do a controlled ascent on your buddy's octo and since doubles mean you are quite likely to plan for deco stops this could be bad for your life expectancy.  In a reasonable wet suit or a dry this will still mean weight on your belt but it also means you start the dive being 6Kgs negative which feels a bit clunky. This is normal and it does help you do a nice prompt descent. If you have a dry suit this is the point where you need to always thing drysuit AND wing for buoyancy control. 6 litres of gas is too much to have slopping about in your suit so use both, think both and it all becomes second nature and when something breaks (I've had a BCD inflater come off in my hand once and, another day, a neck seal tear from top to bottom) you just use the other one.  Double are great and allow you to do more interesting diving but they also allow you to get into more trouble so you need to always have a plan B."
scuba,32zrng,runsongas,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"He (or anyone) really shouldn't be diving doubled HP100s wet without a double-bladder wing. Drysuit preferable. If the wing fails, you need the drysuit to control your buoyancy. Yes, you can sometimes shoot a bag or an SMB or find another line to climb up, but only if you don't sink so far in the time it takes you to shoot the bag that you go into deco, get narced and pass out, oxtox, etc, etc.  People do it. That doesn't make it a good idea."
scuba,32zrng,nigelh,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for chiming in. All my doubles experience is in 30ft or less of open water for valve practice and general experience.  Lose your wing and you become a giant lead weight with steel doubles, makes sense to me.  OP, tell us what conditions you are diving in and maybe someone can recommend an affordable drysuit/undergarmets package for you to consider to get you diving safely!"
scuba,32zrng,runsongas,2,Mon Apr 20 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"A double-bladder wing is also an option - pretty much every manufacturer makes one, it has a completely independent backup bladder and LPI that you hook up from the post that you would otherwise use for your drysuit.  Conventional wisdom is that doubled AL80's is about the biggest thing that you can expect to be able to swim up, and I'm pretty sure even that would really suck. I need to try it just to see if I can, since I think doubled AL80's will eventually be my smaller, more manageable twinset (current set is doubled LP125s).  It's a much smaller investment than a drysuit, but I'd really much rather have the suit. I don't think I'll ever go back to diving wet, even for tropical vacation diving."
scuba,32zrng,kevski82,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:26:51 2015 UTC,Yes it is. I currently use a wrap around cressi. This is completely new to me. I plan on getting into technical diving next so for the deal i go i thought it would be worth investing the money now to save me money in the future.
scuba,32zrng,sharkiteuthis,0,Mon Apr 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the tank boots and take the knob piece off the dump valve. The first time you accidentally clip a stage bottle to it and you drop past your MOD or into the silt, you'll have wished that you did. The angled values expose the hoses to more risk for getting sheared off if you hit something hard."
scuba,32zrng,mblitch,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:25:06 2015 UTC,So should i look into getting getting a new manifold? Why should i take the boots off?
scuba,32zrng,runsongas,5,Sat Apr 18 13:22:17 2015 UTC,"Keep the boots. Decades ago they were thought to 'hide rust on steel tanks' but if you remove the boots you scrape off the paint so it rusts. I pull the boots on my twins every couple of years and it's pristine yellow paint underneath. Plus they stand up. From the colour those look like Ali's anyway so I'm a bit confused.  Keep the manifold too. I wondered if it was 300bar as it looked deep but I'm not sure. I would say dive it as is and I hope you both have a lot of fun together. Beware the weird twinset cults telling you that everything but their own holy configuration is evil, immoral, fattening and causes cancer in rats."

scuba,32yw54,kroneksix,6,Fri Apr 17 23:51:51 2015 UTC,Careful! My inbox got very upset when I suggested that tec and rec gear wear essentially the same! :)
scuba,32yw54,CanadianDiver,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:50:31 2015 UTC,Since the distinction between 'tech' and 'rec' is totally arbitrary and probably differs from person to person you're getting the usual reddit idiot on your case. I don't see it as a useful distinction as it is just used to stroke egos.
scuba,32yw54,nigelh,3,Sat Apr 18 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize this was such a point of contention. I thought a technical dive was any dive with a ceiling, regardless of whether that ceiling is real (penetration dive) or virtual (mandatory decompression stops).  Technical dives in that context require equipment which is fault tolerant, precluding the use of e.g. a single cylinder and single regulator. What am I missing?"
scuba,32yw54,nigelh,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"That is one definition of 'technical' diving and it's probably one of the better ones. The thing that blurs the distinction is seeing the approach 'technical divers' take to a shallow dive. They don't stop thinking the same way just because they are doing a 12 meter inshore reef in calm water to see if they can take home some scallops that they use on a 60 meter wreck penetration in a deep Atlantic swell.  Either way I liked the write up on twins with a nice clear argument for Primary take. The only deviation I would personally make is to use two SPGs. Relying on noticing the rate of change is bad when a difference between two is obvious. I have had an SPG fail on a dive, it just stuck, and it complicated my ascent hugely. Closing my eyes and reciting the mantra ""I believe the gas plan will work"" did not make me feel happy inside. If my buddy had then had a gas problem... I place the SPG on the 'if you need something take two' list not as 'something else to fail'."
scuba,32yw54,nigelh,2,Sun Apr 19 09:58:50 2015 UTC,"What did you have in mind when you say ""approach""? Plan the dive and dive the plan? Situational awareness? Or just using gear which is overkill for the task at hand? Personally, I will often opt to use one of my twinsets over a single because I like the stability, and having the redundancy available is never a bad thing, but that has to be weighed against weight, drag and logistical issues. A shallow reef hop off a RIB would see me using a single for sure.  As for the SPG, it was a weak point for me to suggest that this would indicate a valve rolloff. Contacting the overhead should be the clue - all part of situational awareness. I don't know what the failure probability of a SPG is, but to employ a second unit, adding a hose and three o-rings, with the routing and access issues, to cover a rare failure when the second SPG doesn't add any utility unless the failure occurs, seems misguided. Especially when you consider that you already have a redundant SPG in the form of your buddy's gauge, given that you are diving the same profile, and you already know the applicable RMV because you had to accommodate it when devising the gas plan for the dive."
scuba,32yw54,DoctorHandwaver,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"Approach? When you do a buddy check you are planning the rescue. When you discuss the dive plan you are formulating a gas plan. Agree the signals. Agree the monitoring. Agree the ascent plan in detail. That sort of stuff.   when the second SPG doesn't add any utility unless the failure occurs   You just didn't say that did you? Why do you carry two regulators? Actually I trust an extra HP hose and a gauge far more than I do a brain saturated in nitrogen. Despite my ego insisting I am a big smart diver now the weakest link, once I am in the water, is always me."
scuba,32yw54,nigelh,2,Sun Apr 19 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"Two regs is so that you can breathe in the event of a single reg failure, or so that you can donate gas to a buddy in the unlikely event of a total gas loss.  I don't know that a redundant SPG falls into the same class of importance in preventing unfavorable outcomes since having something appropriate to breathe is definitely more important than having exact knowledge of how much of that gas you have...  That's not to say there's zero utility in redundant SPGs, just a little bit less than redundant regs.     From your website's rant (which is a really great read, BTW) ""Failure point counting has its place in assessing a rig but it is not the be-all-and-end-all defining method.""  I agree with that statement.  I'd also argue that complete equipment redundancy isn't either.  Good gas planning, and buddies/teams (if you have one), are the assumed redundancy for a failed SPG.  Then again I don't do dives as deep and long as you do so, so maybe in a few years and a nasty SPG failure I'll change my tune on this, maybe not.    It's tricky (at least in my mind) to work out this problem with failure probabilities (and modes) and their repercussions and the benefits of redundancy here.  I think there are arguments to both sides. I guess it's weighing the benefit of that piece of mind/stress/task loading that comes with SPG redundancy, and lowering failure points that could make bad situations worse.  I don't really have a strong opinion one way or the other , and I wouldn't call anyone a stroke based on the number of spgs hooked up to their twinset (assuming it's <= 2)."
scuba,32yw54,DoctorHandwaver,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're actually coming from the same place. The key safety thing is to think things through. I liked the post because it spelt out 'why' rather than just said 'do this'. You can feed that into your own risk assessments and, just like the SPG question, make a reasoned decision to suit your own requirements. This is the sort of thing people need to read as they break into technical diving so they plan for, and practice for, the 'what if' cases. I was fortunate to get into twinsets with a buddy and we had an agreement to spring drills on one another. Having somebody who waits the primary-take for the end of your exhale sucks the first few times but the game makes hard things easy."

scuba,32yl28,Chesty-Copperpot,9,Fri Apr 17 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"Wow ... ok slow down a second.  What experience do you have? Have you ever dove with multiple tanks before?  5'10"" 250 doesn't automatically mean high air consumption. Have you tried working on trim and buoyancy further? I'm 5'10"" 200lbs and a dive to the NDL at 130' for me on an AL80 will still result in my having half a tank left when I surface.   I have found gas to usually be as limiting as bottom time using a single steel 120.   Sure- but double tanks is just going to make it much easier for you to get into decompression without appropriate training.   I am currently working on some research projects that will require some task loading at depths of up to 130FSW. In the past, I have done a similar project (although with different fish) at depths approaching 110FSW. I have found gas to usually be as limiting as bottom time using a single steel 120.   What position do you need to be in for this research? If you're going to be in flat trim anyway- sidemount may have been a better choice for you (a moot point now- but something to consider for the future).   So, on to the doubles. I can't find much information on the bands. I am assuming that they're pretty standard: holes for bolts are in the center, since the bands are independent of each other, I can slide them up/down as necessary. Is that an accurate assumption?   There are two types of bands. Hard bands, and soft bands. Hard bands are used with a manifold to prevent movement of any sort. They are bolted in place so they are a pain in the ass to swap around. You generally don't move them from tank to tank a lot.  Soft bands (aka travel bands) are not for use with a manifold- but are designed to be easily broken down and switched to another set of tanks. This gives you more flexibility and allows you to switch between different sizes and types of tanks. That said- you still want tanks with left and right handed valves so you can shut down a post in an emergency (most to keep water out of the tank to help keep you from getting too light) and for organization purposes. The problem is you are unlikely to find that. The main problem with soft bands is that no one has been making a decent set in a long time- though apparently there was a decent set a friend saw at BTS this year so maybe that's changing...  This is another case where sidemount may be a better choice- it works better with left/right valves- but you can still do a valve drill even with two standard valves.   I have the choice between doubling up on steel 120s or Al80s since that's what the dive shop has to rent. If I do the Al80s, I'll have 33% more air than previously, but only 33%. If I go with the steel 120s I can probably do it with one tank per dive, switching the empty out between dives. But the steel 120s will be heavy and although I am strong it's new to me.   33% more should be fine- the more gas you add- the more you're opening yourself up to significant deco obligations. They're also lighter and one of the biggest problems for new doubles divers is that they are heavy and can easily roll you over. Depending on your exposure protection- you may not need any additional weight with the AL80's. If you do need more weight- you can add it to pockets on the waist band of the harness which will lower the CG and make diving the tanks easier.  Double steel 120's (HP I assume- LP would be even more ridiculous) are massive and completely overkill for your application. Double HP 100's are really the ideal size for the vast majority of divers in water shallower than 200'."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,3,Fri Apr 17 20:35:18 2015 UTC,"Another thought could be two sets of manifolded 80s. Use one set on the first dive, second set on the next dive.  We're all just speculating though without knowing OP's RMV, etc."
scuba,32yl28,Crash_Coredump,3,Fri Apr 17 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"We're all just speculating though without knowing OP's RMV, etc.   Of course- but if 2 80's isn't sufficient to dive to the NDL at 130' then OP's RMV is through the roof. They may be much better off working with someone to improve their buoyancy and trim rather than just adding more and bigger tanks that make the problem worse by adding weight and drag."

scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't think adding more and bigger tanks is the right solution here. More experience and some help with trim and buoyancy would probably do wonders.  We actually had a guy at the shop I teach with who wanted to get into sidemount because of his air consumption. He could breathe down a 120 before hitting the NDL at 100 feet. He was a new diver (certified a couple of months earlier) and I told him he really wasn't ready for sidemount and that he should work on his trim and buoyancy first. He spent the next 2 months doing a lot of diving while practicing buoyancy control, trim control, and getting rid of excess weight. Lo and behold- his RMV dropped 50%+.  He's still interested in sidemount- but now he wants to do it because he wants to get into more advanced diving :)"
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"These are great comments. My surface air consumption as calculated on these working dives is averages around 0.95 cubic feet per minute. My SAC on these dives is higher than my rec dives (which is closer to 0.75CFM) because I am working at depth. It's not a matter of trim, I am kneeling on bottom, wrestling fish out of a trap. I check gauges, dive times, and everything obsessively. So my setup was that I am a big guy AND I have a large gas consumption, not that I have a big gas consumption BECAUSE I am a big guy.  My goal with switching to doubles was to have a redundant backup in case I went through gas quicker than I did no-deco time. I have done dozens of dives at 110FSW with a single steel 120 and been satisfied, but would have felt better on the surface with a little more air. So, if I had what I could afford, one pair of steel 120s (that converts to 120 cubic feet of air at 1 atmosphere), I would have 240 cubic feet of air that I could use in that day, which would limit me to two dives where three have been possible in the past.  So, what seemed ideal to me was to get one of those travel band setups where I could have two redundant first stages along with a primary and secondary second stage on each tank, breathe one down and, if necessary, use the second one for surfacing and switch out the empty tank for a full one for the second dive.  It seems to me that the manifold idea won't be workable for the kind of repetitive dives I need to do. The steel tank bands also might not be workable either, because of the necessity of switching out. It seems like I might be overcomplicating this. I might just need to look into a pony bottle should it be needed."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,2,Sat Apr 18 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"My surface air consumption as calculated on these working dives is averages around 0.95 cubic feet per minute.   That's still a pretty high SAC rate- but it sounds like you have a reasonable amount of experience.  The thing is- at 110 feet and with a .95CFM SAC rate you should be able to breathe off a steel 120 for almost 30 minutes. The NDL is only 16 minutes at 110.  Sidemount isn't going to work for you either because of the kneeling position so that's out.   So, if I had what I could afford, one pair of steel 120s (that converts to 120 cubic feet of air at 1 atmosphere), I would have 240 cubic feet of air that I could use in that day, which would limit me to two dives where three have been possible in the past.   Dual 120's are heavy. Like really, seriously, heavy. They're going to try to roll you or pitch you unless you've got them dialed in. If you want something you can switch back and forth between- then it's not  abad idea- but you have to be able to manhandle them.   So, what seemed ideal to me was to get one of those travel band setups where I could have two redundant first stages along with a primary and secondary second stage on each tank, breathe one down and, if necessary, use the second one for surfacing and switch out the empty tank for a full one for the second dive.   The main issue is finding travel bands these days- all the companies that used to make them stopped- so you either need to make your own- or buy used. Unless you know someone that's making them again.   It seems to me that the manifold idea won't be workable for the kind of repetitive dives I need to do. The steel tank bands also might not be workable either, because of the necessity of switching out. It seems like I might be overcomplicating this. I might just need to look into a pony bottle should it be needed.   A manifold probably doesn't make sense for you. and would definitely complicate the switching of tanks here and there."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:37:05 2015 UTC,"That's true if I breathe the tank empty. What happens is I check my gauge and start wrapping things up at 1200 PSI, which ""should"" give me approximately 20 minutes of bottom time (assuming I get to the site without any traversing). Then there's the air that I leave in the tank when I surface, probably 20%, so subtract another 6 minutes. The problem becomes a little more evident.  Then, factor in the possibility of a slight current, an 8-foot hammerhead that swims by or the impossibly large stingray that patrols near us. The air consumption gets a bit closer to marginal."

scuba,32yl28,kroneksix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:21:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I am likely to be doing. Exactly as suggested, emergency use."
scuba,32yl28,Crash_Coredump,3,Sat Apr 18 01:47:00 2015 UTC,"Independent doubles sounds like a lot of work. You'd have to switch between breathing from them during the dive (if you breathe one down to empty then start on the other you'll won't have anything to offer your buddy in an emergency) and you'd need an SPG for each one. If one of your regs free flows you'll lose access to all of the gas in one of the tanks. Plus the switching in and out of tanks sounds like a real pain.      120 cf is what, a 15 litre tank? That's going to be a pain to lug around on the surface - even double 12 litres take some getting used to. In the water, of course, it's all good (doubles feel much more stable than singles and of course you don't feel the weight).       Note that you'll be getting a lot more gas out of a manifolded doubles than two single tanks of similar capacity. That's because the gas reserve you need for your first dive can be re-used as a gas reserve for your second dive. That could mean something like 15% more usable gas between the two dives..."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"That's what I like about my double 100s. I can get 2 90 ft 40 minute dives out of them, or 3 60/60 dives."
scuba,32yl28,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, it seems like a lot of work. Your manifold doubles would be way easier. It's just that with a set of doubles, I will likely have to cancel the last dive before I get in the water because of air.  I think that your 15L is the water volume of the tank, yes? The 120 cubic feet refers to the amount of gas at 1 atmosphere. So if I surface with 500PSI in the tank, I leave 20 cubic feet in the tank, that would still be available in the manifold for the second dive (giving me 140 cubic feet for the second dive), then I would have only a third of what I usually have for the third dive.  So I agree with your points, it's a lot of work. That's why I was polling for better ideas. I wanted to have my thoughts shot down now where it's safe."
scuba,32yl28,randomfrequency,3,Sat Apr 18 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"OK, so to make sure I understand, you have an OMS steel plate with a single tank wing that you've been using with an STA, right?  If you've been at 110FSW and gas has been your limiting factor with a 120, you might want to look for ways to improve your RMV regardless of what you end up doing with your tanks (i.e., singles or doubles). I dive in cold water and have a pretty high RMV and yet I always used to hit NDLs on single 119s or 120s at around those depths. Have you ever calculated your RMV? I'd be curious to see what it is.  Tank bands are pretty standard, unless you have really old tanks (or some people actually double up steel 45s, so obviously those would be a different band from what you are using). You CAN slide them up and down when you want to, but it's a pain in the ass. This isn't something you're going to want to do on any regular basis, and not during a dive out on the boat. ""Standard"" placement is to have the top band at the neck of the tank (where it starts to slope towards the value) but people adjust them to what's comfortable.   Taking tank off and putting them back on a manifold is a REAL pain in the ass. You don't want to do this. So, yes, you are correct, you will basically need a manifold attached to as many sets of doubles as you are planning to use. Independent backmounted doubles are not something that I've tried, but I hear it can be a bit annoying to have to switch back and forth and also you need an additional SPG vs. a manifolded doubles setup.  I'm having trouble understanding what you mean about the double 120s vs double al 80s. You said that if you go with steel 120s, you can use one tank per dive, and switch out the empty -- not really. You'll want to breath down each tank more or less evenly so you don't throw off your balance. I don't think it would be as much of an issue in backmount as it would be in sidemount, but you don't want an almost empty steel 120 on one side and a full one on the other.   You need to also think about whether or not you can get up the boat ladder in double 120s. I dive double 119s and it can be really difficult when you are in rough seas. Even getting off of the boat with double anything can be difficult. Also keep in mind that in double 120s, you will be REALLY negative -- do you have a backup buoyancy source, e.g. drysuit or liftbag, in case your wing fails? You're not going to be able to swim up if you have a wing failure with double 120s."
scuba,32yl28,runsongas,2,Fri Apr 17 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that in double 120s, you will be REALLY negative -- do you have a backup buoyancy source, e.g. drysuit or liftbag, in case your wing fails? You're not going to be able to swim up if you have a wing failure with double 120s.   Excellent point about the buoyancy. If OP is diving in a wet suit and the wing fails- they're really going to be in trouble. They either need a lift bag (Carter 75lb or 100lb are excellent), a drysuit, or a wing with redundant bladders."
scuba,32yl28,runsongas,2,Fri Apr 17 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the buoyancy was my main concern. I was going to go to a controlled environment to see how manageable it was first. It doesn't seem like this is the way I'll go, though."
scuba,32yl28,doombuggy110,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the negative buoyancy was one thing that I considered, getting back in the boat was the other.  Our local dive shop has Al80s or steel 120s. I can't rent any other things, so that's where we're limited. We had done 3 dives a day at 110 before and then slept at sea and done another 3 the next day. So I would need at least 3 manifolds to do it that way.  I see your point about breathing both down equally (the benefit of the manifold), and its benefits for trim, buoyancy, etc. I don't move laterally, though, it's just diving down the trap line, kneeling on bottom, and surfacing on the anchor line. So trim wouldn't be as much of a deal as if I were to be, say, traversing a wreck or something.  Improving my gas consumption is something that I have been trying to deal with, getting in better shape, trim, etc. But my breathing is an issue because I am trying to wrestle fish out of a trap. There's no real way to practice that or do it calmly, I suppose. But I appreciate your comment, it's the first/best thing to do in this situation.  Anyway, it seems that the steel bands are not going to be workable. I was thinking it might be a pain to switch them out. Thanks for the comments."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely want to have the tanks already assembled, manifolded, etc. Take a look at this page and video -- not something you will want to do on a boat."
scuba,32yl28,runsongas,2,Sat Apr 18 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"You're correct about the bands and spacing.  You place the tanks in the same distance as your STA.  Just do the manifold. It'll allow you access to the other tank's gas if the other regulator should fail.   As for needing a second set of doubles, I would get training with stage bottles to extend your backgas times.  The general idea is that you breathe down the AL80(s?) and do multiple dives that way.  Steel 120s will weigh about as much as steel 130s, and have less gas.  AL80s will need so much additional weight that they'll weigh as much as the 120s..    If you're renting, that's going to be a LOT of teardown and setup - the bands also need to be attached and fit while the tanks are empty - full tanks expand after they're filled."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"That's something I hadn't considered, the tank expansion.  So it seems that the steel tank bands are not going to be my way to go, too much task loading. Sincere thanks for the comment."
scuba,32yl28,stds9tng,2,Sat Apr 18 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"if you are committed to independent doubles, the oms travel band system is much easier to set up and tear down if frequently swapping tanks.  sidemount may be another option to look into if the buoyancy of the al80s is not a problem."
scuba,32yl28,TacoExcellence,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am committed to that over the manifold. But I am thinking that this isn't the best setup now. It seems that since I have enough air for the dives, I am just a tad concerned for surfacing, it might be better to get a pony bottle.  The travel bands seem like my best option if I go with that route, I hadn't considered them. Thanks."
scuba,32yl28,Crash_Coredump,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:11:41 2015 UTC,"if you go for a pony, get a 30 or 40. plenty of gas to get to the surface and can be converted to a deco bottle later."
scuba,32yl28,runsongas,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"Came here to suggest sidemount. Don't have to worry about a manifold and that point of failure, just move your bands onto whatever two of the same tanks you can get... Any tank, with practice, can be sidemounted. Plus it's not that awful (or so I hear) to do more than one set of doubles, whereas with BM, you'll have a floppy stage or two, but sidemount has slightly less floppy extra bottles.  Just a thought. Sidemount, like backmount, has advantages and disadvantages. There isn't ever a perfect solution. Personally, I love the ease of travel and ability to swap everything and the redundancy."

scuba,32v8gf,alli_elizabeth,5,Fri Apr 17 00:09:40 2015 UTC,"I do most of my lion fish hunting in the Pompano FL area. I have probably killed upwards of 50 or so. I started with a 22"" lion fish speciality pole spear with a 6 prong barbed tip.   Do not use barbed tips, the lion fish are very difficult to get off the spear. But do use a tri-tip so the LF does not slide up or move during the kill.  My experience has taught me some of largest lion fish seem to have grown weary of divers. Most if not all bore scars of failed spearing attempts and swim(sometimes quickly) into the reef at the first sign of a diver approaching. I decided to upgrade from my 22 inch pole spear to something bigger. I now use a 36"" aluminum pole spear, with a 8"" three prong tip. This gives me the reach to get up into the crags of the reef as well as a little more power (i have had the 22 inch spear bounce off some of the bigger fish).  I always run a knife behind the head while still on the spear. I have been envenomated once and now, while hunting, wear a Hexarmor puncture proof glove on the hand I will be doing the killing with.   I find the 36"" pole spear the ideal for LF killing. Happy Hunting"
scuba,32v8gf,absolutbill,2,Fri Apr 17 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"You can use something like this and the barbs aren't as much of a problem: http://safespear.poweredbyindigo.com/v.php?pg=45  It's got a one way flap, so while the fish is still on the spear you push it through the neck and as you retract the spear the flap holds the fish so you can get it out. Although it might be overkill depending on what you're doing, the bag can hold about 50+ lionfish so it's more for people seriously doing removal. Someone in a group I was diving with on a trip got 70 in a single dive once.  For spear length, I seemed to have more success with the longer ones. Not sure if it was more stable or I was able to draw the band back further to get more power, but that's my experience."

Takes about 30 seconds to do each lens and you'll never have to use toothpaste to scrub. Just be careful not to burn the silicon skirt. Then just clean it with soapy water to get any burnt film residue off. And spit in it before a dive.  I've done this with 4 masks, never had a problem. Tried the toothpaste method but it never worked for me and mine fogged up every 30 seconds. Now it doesn't fog at all."

Forgetting the mouthpiece can make an apparently good-fit mask leak like a sieve.  You're going to have to try the magic anti-fog tricks. Actually deliberately part flooding the mask so you have half an inch of water in it lets you clear the glass at will by just tipping your head so the water runs over it works. When you first do it it sucks but within a few minutes it drops to mildly annoying and doesn't mess the dive."

scuba,32usqu,Here_Four_Beer,5,Thu Apr 16 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"Depends if they've done 4 dives or 400.  I have no problem going into a wreck with an OW buddy that I know has 300 dives, ~30 of which have been with me. He just hasn't ever cared to get ADV or anything else, but his buoyancy is near perfect and he's a good diver.    On the other hand, I know a DM, who is probably pushing 1000 dives, that I don't even like to go on Resort dives with.    Depends on conditions, type of wreck/environment. No-one should be penetrating anything without adequate skill. Lots of 'overhead environment' have daylight visible at all times, don't silt up and aren't really a hazard... despite what some people might yell at you."
scuba,32usqu,AussieEquiv,7,Fri Apr 17 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"There are some wrecks in Ontario that ""penetrating"" isn't such a big deal. They're not that big or silty and very easy to navigate with lots of large entries and exits. There are other wrecks that are simply deathtraps on the inside. The bottom line here is that you should ALWAYS listen to and respect the divemaster, instructor, or charter operator. They probably know more than you. Generally, if you can't see without a flashlight don't go in past your ankles!   That said, popping into a ""safe"" popular wreck is a lot of fun! Being inside a wreck is a really cool experience."

Does it silt easily? What if the line breaks, lights fail? I don't care if I'm being annoying my safety comes first. If I am not confident that it is safe I will not dive.

scuba,32usqu,qwimjim,2,Fri Apr 17 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"Because when diving we have the buddy system and all kinds of rules because plenty of people have died while affording us the opportunity to scuba dive.  Other sports don't have to account for complex physiology involved like diving does.  If you don't understand I'll just say that you're wrong, and that you should read the book 'diver down'.  It's a short easy read with lots of accident analysis and other info. I'd suggest it to any diver.  People do things they shouldn't all the time, some are even common such as a dive to 120ft with only an 80cuft tank.  Sure you're safe 95% of the time but that extra 5% isn't a sprained wrist or a broken leg, it's somebody dying.  I want people to have fun diving, but go the extra tiny little step and be safe."

No buddy = certain death. Far more people die skiing every year than do scuba diving. Still, people routinely hire guides to assess conditions, show them local terrain, etc.. Who they must trust with their lives. And sometimes guides and their clients die because nothing is without risk. I see no difference with diving."

Thus, I dove them with the rest of people, nothing particular dangerous if you keep your wits about.  PS: Sounds like you fear might be misplaced. There are easy dives, there are hard dives."
scuba,32usqu,texasguy911,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"Conservatism is fine ... but as @AussieEquiv points out, the level of real in-water experience (and subsequent level of skill and ability to assess risks) as per his ""4 dives or 400"" does apply.  Similarly, let's also not forget the money aspect of Agencies issuing cards for all sorts of stuff, so just because a Card exists for it does not mean that it is the only way to attain the requisite skills...particularly the ""wisdom"" part.   The issue of 'overhead' diving is an interesting one philosophically; I can recall some 'Egghead' discussions on it many years ago on threshold definitions.  For example, if swimming through a 20ft long pipe counts as overhead, then we probably would say a 19ft pipe does too, and an 18ft  ... 17, 16, 15 ... etc ... but at what length does such a pipe stop becoming an overhead?  5ft?  3ft?  Less?   As a thought exercise, this was simply using an approach of 'Reductio ad Extremum' (Latin: ""reduction to the extreme"") to see when it became 'Argumentum ad Absurdum' (Latin: ""argument to absurdity"")...and it is something to think about the next time that you swim through a hula-hoop {*}, were you (even but for a moment) in an 'Overhead Environement' and thus subject to all of the requisite tsk-tsk sounds and Agency wrist-slapping for being naughty?      {*} - sidebar question: does Bonaire still have its UW 'ultimate buoyancy control' obstacle course of submerged hula-hoops still set up?  I think it used to be at ~60fsw at ... Captain Dons?  In any event, one of the rules of thumb which came up on this subject that has been published in training guides is that the sum of the diver's depth (few) and their distance of overhead penetration should not ever exceed 130 feet.   For example, a 25' 'swim thru' at 100fsw sums to 125 so it is supposedly ""okay"".  However, this is overly simplistic and has problems with its endpoints (e.g., a 100ft long sewer pipe at 20fsw versus a 1ft overhead ledge at 129fsw)...bottom line is that even common sense based 'rules of thumb' have their limits of usefulness.    Thus said, overheads aren't something to be taken trivially, either, even though there's ample examples of relatively easy and 'clean' wreck dives and swim-throughs/tunnels at many resort destinations where the concern for AOW, OW and even Novice OW divers is not particularly high.  And with pretty good reason, too:  dive equipment is brutally reliable these days, the sites are well known by the dive operators (minimal passages with ""a chance to really get into trouble""), good visibility, minimal currents, silting risk, etc ... and finally, typically as daytime dives such that they can be interpreted as akin to ""Cavern"", where natural light is present as an aid to assist any urgent escape."

An easy dive is to get in the water, you'll notice that there are some numbers painted on the side of the wall, swim out to the 7.5 mark (don't swim close to the wall, since people are often fishing there) and descend there, you'll drop in about 40 ft of water. If you don't see the wall right away (a jumble of rocks, actually) swim south until you find it, and then swim out, keeping the wall on your right.  Take it easy. In California it's more about finding the small stuff: nudibranchs, octopuses hiding in small holes, brittle stars under the rocks, rockfish, gobies, etc. If you swim fast you'll miss a lot of stuff. A light could be handy to look under rocks. When it's time to turn around swim back keeping the wall on your left now. The wall makes a left turn and you'll find a steep sand slope that will bring you back to 15-20 ft. You can do your safety stop and if you still have air left you can swim on a 250 degree heading toward the beach, surfacing when you reach 500 psi or 6-8 ft of depth.   It's been pretty cold recently! Another good dive would be to stay in the ""middle reef"" area. From the stairs, slightly to the left and about in the middle of the cove there's some kelp. That's in about 15-20 ft, so the water will be warmer, there will be more sunlight, you can last longer and since you'll be diving in kelp it's probably more what you are looking for. Sea lions and seals may come there, but to see them for sure diving the wall and getting close to the end of it pretty much guarantees that you'll see them underwater."

The parking lot is in Whaler's Cove, the yellow circle that says ""You are here"" in the map that I linked. You get into the water through the boat ramp (and only through the boat ramp! You are not allowed to get in the water anywhere else). Be careful, it is sleek with algae. In low tide it can get interesting since there's a big step into the deep water at the end.   But before that take a short hike to the top of the hill at the end of the parking lot. There are some steps going up. From the top you have a nice view of the cove. Usually visibility in the cove is not very good, for the best diving you have to go out a little bit, but the kelp makes it harder. That's why it's a good idea to take this hike, to know where you need to go. Here's a good picture from above. There's a way to swim through the kelp following the sand channel. Go back to the other map I linked and read what it says about Doggy, Worm Patch and Sand Channel.  So, swim out so that you more or less will drop on Worm Patch, take a heading out and a heading back into the cove and write them down or set your compass, you'll need them to verify on the way back. Drop and then follow the sand channel (it's going to be pretty obvious underwater) and follow it out. Then take a left when the structure starts opening up on the left, and you should be close to Hole in the Wall (a small hole about 1 m in diameter, close to the ground, on a rock wall). You can swim around this area, by now you should be getting close to needing to go back, but if you still have air you can look for the Lone Metridium, further to the left past the wall with Hole in the Wall.   On the way back you can swim underwater past Worm Patch, and surface when the algae and kelp starts to get too thick and confusing so that you can figure out where you are. Usually it's a short surface swim to the ramp from there.   Another good dive would be Middle Reef.   Again, swim slowly so that you can find the nudibranchs, the abalone, crabs, shrimp, etc.   There are fresh water hoses to give your gear a quick rinse.   Have fun!"

Only time i saw multiple is in sb island, and they were very playful. Generally the boats do three dives, the first is where you want to go, second is pretty good and the third I usually skip. Basically they do the surface interval as they are headed back to land. Any island you go to will have its own gems, Catalina is crystal clear water but the kelp forests are gone due to an invasive plant, Anacapa the water is not clear however the forests are huge , sb is like Anacapa however less forest more structure and lions. As far as beach diving, we go to laguna beach , shaws's cove or wood's cove (about a mile apart), its free, get there early to get parking. There is a full dive shop a mile away."

Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish, the outcome are pups really malnourished washed out on the shores, these conditions lead some of these pups to death  if not rescued on time.

scuba,32ukzl,Troglophile,2,Fri Apr 17 19:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hey Zed, looks like you're getting some mixed info.   Is your budget under $50?  If not, then what is your budget limit? $200, $500 more?  You can get UW disposables at any dive shop or online. Odds are film verison will do better than most cheapo digitals.  But let's look beyond that, why are you wanting to take photos?  How  long have you been diving?   Photographing while diving can make things interesting and also more difficult. Instead of paying attention to yourself, making sure you aren't crashing into the reef, checking your air, checking your buddy, and enjoying all the incredible things to see around you, you will be focused on taking a photo of one thing.  If you have a cheapo camera and no lighting thenyour photos are not going to ever match what you see with your eyes. overall it may degrade your experience.   It is a better idea to first practice surface photography and get used to matching what you see to your photos. Once things match up there save money and get something that can go UW.  Then the learning process starts again, but will be more rewarding.  Meanwhile get out and dive, practice your skills underwater so you have a solid foundation to make taking photos easier and more enjoyable.  If you really want to remember your dives then go home, fill out your dive log and in a journal write about the experience, write about what you saw, what you felt, what the day and conditions were like.   This will do a better job of bringing you back to the dive than a really bad photo.   Whatever you do, do not buy any of the suggested ""Waterproof"" cameras that do not have housings. Those cameras are only ""waterproof"" to certain depths and most don't actually allow you to take photos at those depths, it just keeps them from getting ruined if dropped in water.  Waterproof is not equal to water tight.  Talk some more about your experience, wants/needs and budget and we'll see if we can help better direct you. There is a lot of info out there and it can get overwhelming.  So let's start with your goals."

When it's blowing up a bit you get your fins on square, hang on tight and look up (the usual signal for 'go' here) and when you get up to the deck the crew grab you, put you on a bench and lash your tanks/breather to the rail so you can dekit.

Even if the entire disk was overwritten forensic tools can sometimes recover data that has been ovewritten - it's well beyond the level that tools like photorec can recover, but I'd think that if this was entering into forensics territory, that a firm could do the analysis of the disk. If it's important enough (which, let's be honest, this probably isn't), you can look at the levels of the memory cells and create a probabilistic model of the previous contents of the cells."
scuba,32nx0h,eco_was_taken,2,Wed Apr 15 12:43:31 2015 UTC,Even if the entire disk was overwritten forensic tools can sometimes recover data that has been ovewritten   That's not true. Maybe you are thinking of a formatting? Formatting can leave data around in an unstructured way that could be recovered but actually overwriting an entire disk makes previous data unrecoverable. There's a myth that's gone around for ages that experts (usually the CIA or NSA) can recover data that's been overwritten so you need to overwrite the disk several times over to make sure it's truly wiped. Researchers with state of the art magnetic tunneling microscopes have never been able to recover more than a bit or two trying to do this.  If they deleted the photos then filled up the memory card again the photos are definitely gone. If they just deleted the photos and haven't touched the memory card since the photos are almost certainly still there.
scuba,32nx0h,Bigwhistle,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:12:15 2015 UTC,Depends how big the card was as well. If it's small then the new photos may overwrite as they near fill the card on each trip. Any way you look at it though it's not a great thing to do in the first place.  There was many things highlighted in the article I looked at and thought why?

scuba,32qw0s,SurferRosa93,5,Thu Apr 16 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"First, if it's been two years, get a refresher course with a local dive instructor.   It's a basic 1-2 hour thing where you go over the safety procedures and do a little pool diving.   Second.   I've never been on a charter where everyone just wanders off on their own.   These are pretty much guided tours.   That being said you will want to buddy up and follow normal safety procedures even if your buddy is the guide.   Beyond that, I suppose check out local dive clubs to meet people you may want to go diving with.  Definitely helps to have someone you trust with you."

scuba,32qw0s,eanx100,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:28:33 2015 UTC,Also depends on the local conditions. A guided tour might be more adviseable in areas with well known high speed currents. Where the water is fairly shallow and fairly safe they may not be so worried about divers not returning.

It's a safety thing, offered to help prevent people getting into situations where either inexperience or lack of confidence puts their life at risk or makes a resident divemaster/instructor's job much harder and potentially risking their own life.  You will walk away with refreshed knowledge of the basics that all basic certifications should teach. It won't be extensive, you will need to re-read your training manual and or request specific exercises if you want something not covered by every course, but they shouldn't be able to turn you down just for having a different certification agency."

scuba,32qw0s,famousmodification,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"Since it's been two years, and you don't know anybody to go diving with, doing a refresher class probably isn't a bad idea. And once you remember how you're doing, join a club. There tends to be lots of local dive clubs in areas around good diving, and they're generally full of friendly people. I don't know where you're located, but I assume you're near the ocean since your username is SurferRosa93. If there's shore diving near you, chances are there are clubs that go diving every weekend, so start doing some googling.  And as far as dive charters go, when you don't have a buddy of your own, you typically pair up with another single diver or get stuck with the boat's divemaster. Some charters everyone might stick together, but on others the pairs go off and explore and just have to be back at the boat after a certain amount of time.  Also, you'd be surprised how many people are scuba certified. A lot of them might never have done anything with it, but if you start mentioning scuba to people you'll probably start learning that a bunch of the people you know are certified. At that point it mostly becomes a matter of finding one of them who's interested in doing some diving.  I'd recommend dive clubs, though, since that's the best way to find people with recent, local experience to show you the sights."

And the feeling of peeing mid-way into your dive is both awkward and awesome.  It's a real relief to be able to do it, and to know you can totally changes your (bad) habits regarding hydration. A lot of divers aren't well hydrated before diving specifically to avoid having to pee during the dive. When you know you can, dehydration becomes a non-issue, with more comfort and more safety to you."

scuba,32n8tq,FlightlessFish,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:50:43 2015 UTC,That they jammed. Just like he taught us to be very careful not to let the snow get in the valves as we assembled things and not to even turn things on until they were immersed in that nice warm water.  I reasoned that if you reduce the margins the sum total may trap you - a valve turned until the metal touches dissimilar metal is at risk if the temperature variations are large but I was just a little instrumentation physicist but he was a researcher at the Max Planck Institute so he out gunned me for physics.
scuba,32n8tq,nigelh,0,Sun Apr 19 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"If they jam, it'll be because they're in a block of ice- not because of metal contraction. From a purely functional standpoint, ""full"" and ""quarter back"" usually make no difference in modern valves at recreational depths (deeper down, depending on how much you go back you can starve yourself for gas).  Reducing the potential failure points is indeed a good way to go about decision making, but further research will show that ""quarter turn back"" is introducing a failure point rather than removing one."

If you go the surface supplied route you might have better luck with oil and gas or construction. Or if you're really lucky and land a geoduck or urchin gig you can do quite well for yourself.

Been applying for jobs since I graduated last year (June 2014). Haven't had much luck finding a job. I currently work part time in retail and it's soul crushing. I really don't want to go back to school but I like scuba diving and figured I could carve out a career for myself but from all of your feedback I guess it is a tough field to get into.
scuba,32lhdc,destinationlalaland,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"considered rcmp?  there are police dive teams, though entry would possibly take some time.  Public safety diving is very nasty though.  body recoverys, zero vis, drainage ditch, bad-weather-don't-want-to-do-this-ever-diving.  the training could be nice though. kinda like a lot of commercial inland work.  not to beat a dead horse, but you've got the straight goods from the others on this thread.  For me it was the time spent scrounging for work between jobs, fighting employers that were bouncing checks, and the realization that it would probably be a decade before i saw anything resembling a steady job.  now i make money, and dive for fun!"
scuba,32ndfx,Burlesonguy,8,Wed Apr 15 04:15:22 2015 UTC,Do you have any dive shops near you? Best way to find a mask is to go try on lots of them.  I've had an Oceanic Ion that I liked okay but I got an Atomic one recently that I love. But neither work for my SO. It's entirely dependent on fit.
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:26:01 2015 UTC,I'm going to see if I can swing by a local dive shop. Thanks for the heads up!
scuba,32ndfx,RedToby,5,Sat Apr 18 01:56:58 2015 UTC,"Fit is the most important quality.  Go to your local dive shop and they will have several quality brands to try.  I have a SeaSports and a Mares that I really like, but neither may actually fit your face.   There are lots of other features to consider as well, low profile, frameless, purge nose, etc.  It's mostly just personal preference.  Try a bunch on."

scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,2,Wed Apr 15 06:55:06 2015 UTC,That and the Atomic Subframe are my favorite masks.
scuba,32ndfx,texasguy911,2,Wed Apr 15 19:57:22 2015 UTC,Could you compare and contrast these 2 masks?
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,2,Wed Apr 15 20:10:02 2015 UTC,They're very similar masks.  No other mask I've ever tried has as nice a skirt at the Atomic Subframe. The silicone that Atomic uses is strong but very flexible and it seals well against most faces. It has two panes which makes it possible to add corrective lenses.  The Hollis M1 is also a great mask. The silicon skirt isn't quite as supple- but it still seals very well. It's a simpler mask (no individual panes or even frame) which is nice- it makes it smaller and lighter- but you can't add corrective lenses.  For most people either one would be a great choice.
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,2,Wed Apr 15 20:44:40 2015 UTC,Atomic Subframe   I feel like everyone loves this mask but me. I bought it with such high hopes and expectations because everyone raves about it so much.   I was disappointed. It's not as awesome for me as I had expected and I have no idea why. I really really wanted to love it and stuff but I just don't. And it makes me sad. :(   .....Anyone want to buy a brand new Atomic Frameless? :P  ETA - I'm a dumbass and get 0/10 for reading comprehension in the rest of this conversation. Go me!
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,2,Wed Apr 15 20:24:48 2015 UTC,Which width?
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:41:49 2015 UTC,Medium width. Also purple so there's that. :P
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:45:41 2015 UTC,Medium is the narrower of the two masks- I find it rarely fits people unless they have a very narrow face. Are you sure that was the best fit for you?
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, positive. My current mask is also a medium Atomic and it's perfect."
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:51:08 2015 UTC,It's not as awesome for me as I had expected and I have no idea why.   Figuring that out would be the first step. Does it leak? Take too long to clear? Just doesn't fit right?
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it doesn't fit horribly or anything. It fits okay, just isn't as comfortable as my current mask. It's just...off for me. I would dive with it if I had to but given the choice, the Sub-Frame mask is my preference."
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:52:33 2015 UTC,"I would dive with it if I had to but given the choice, the Sub-Frame mask is my preference.    Wait- I just realized you wrote ""Frameless""  No one said anything about the Atomic Frameless mask :)"
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"....  Ha. Haha. Brb coffee because that was bad on my part. You mean this mask right? In which case, I super puffy heart love it to pieces and want a second one but can't justify the price right now.  (I jumped to conclusions because everyone always raves about the Frameless one. Sorry!)"
scuba,32ndfx,stds9tng,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:04:48 2015 UTC,Yeah- that's the subframe mask and it rules. I have an ARC version and a regular version for instructing (because it gets beaten up).  The Hollis M1 is a frameless mask that's as nice to dive as the Atomic Subframe.
scuba,32ndfx,misplacedyank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:11:39 2015 UTC,I got confused because most people seem to adore the Frameless one and I haven't seen many people talk about the Sub-Frame one!   I have a clear skirt and want the black skirt one too but I can't really justify a second mask until I manage to offload the Frameless. Got a new OW class starting and people don't have stuff yet. Maybe it'll work for one of them! ::crosses fingers::
scuba,32ndfx,nigelh,3,Wed Apr 15 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"As others say fit is everything. You want something that seals brilliantly with the strap virtually slack. A badly fitting mask, it may be a brilliant mask but your face is wrong for it, after an hour or so in the water becomes evil."
scuba,32ndfx,bruceybloke,2,Wed Apr 15 17:41:14 2015 UTC,I personally love the oceanic Shadow mask.. they typically last me around a year (diving 2x a day) and they're relatively inexpensive compared to some of the masks out there!
scuba,32ndfx,Requiem_11,2,Wed Apr 15 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"I like mine too, but I've found that it takes a little more than one or two scrubs with toothpaste to break it in.  Ultimately I resorted to an Ajax paste to clean it."
scuba,32ndfx,bruceybloke,2,Wed Apr 15 04:24:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I had to put a lighter to my glass too really get it good
scuba,32ndfx,Requiem_11,2,Wed Apr 15 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"I was ready to put them in the ""you get what you pay for"" pile until I did the Ajax.  Good to know it wasn't just me."
scuba,32ndfx,openzeus,2,Wed Apr 15 04:36:46 2015 UTC,"I had this mask until I tried to rinse it one time while the boat was moving (ooops). It's got a nice FOV and a comfy strap, and I never got mask squeeze. I didn't notice that benefit until I used a backup mask and had to equalize the mask way more often to prevent discomfort. I have a big nose too and never had a problem with it pressing against my face."
scuba,32ndfx,bruceybloke,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:07:17 2015 UTC,yeah it's suuuper comfortable
scuba,32ndfx,nagrom_retxed,2,Wed Apr 15 06:20:27 2015 UTC,"I had an Oceanic Pioneer mask. Great field of view and nice looking mask but did not fit properly, my nose was too big for it.  Just got myself a Scubapro Synergy Twin Trufit. The skirt is super soft and the nose pocket is big enough. Great field of view as well.  It's best to try masks on to avoid what I found with my first mask. A good check for fit is to put the mask on your face without the strap around your head and inhale through your nose. If it forms a seal and stays on your face, that's a good sign. Then, just make sure the nose pocket is big enough and that it feels comfortable.  Also, if you don't know already, nearly all masks come from the manufacturer with a thin invisible layer of film on the lenses. This layer will cause your mask to fog up very quickly, so most people either use a non-abrasive toothpaste to scrub it off or burn it off with a lighter. Personally, I use the lighter method as I've used the toothpaste method and I didn't find it very effective."
scuba,32kf3x,ruk_hai,11,Tue Apr 14 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"My first advice is something many forget: if you're a newbie diver, concentrate more on your diving than your damn gopro! I see so many newbies down there kicking coral and in general, screwing up their diving, because they're so concentrated on the camera."
scuba,32kf3x,avboden,7,Tue Apr 14 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"I have limited experience with my gopro, but definitely a red filter and spare batteries. If you're going to be somewhere that power is limited to certain hours because it's on a generator or something also get a separate battery charger so you can charge multiple at once. Also make sure you have enough storage space for what you'll be doing. I also usually bring along an external hard drive and move my videos onto that when my card starts getting full to make sure I don't run out of space during a dive. It sucks big time when your camera beeps at you one minute before you see something awesome. I had a floaty backdoor but never put it on since the mounts all had wrist straps and if I somehow lost it on entry we could always descend and get it due to the dive profiles and conditions.   I've tried diving with a head mount, wrist strap, and selfie stick and preferred the last two. Head mount was hard to get the angle right and never quite felt secure enough for me. With an extendable selfie stick / monopod you can get really close shots of things without getting your hands too near. It also seemed that fish were much less scared of the camera when it was on the stick than when it was on my hand/head along with my bubbles.   Also useful are anti-fog inserts and a microfiber cloth to keep the lenses/housing/filters as clear as possible. Last tip is to keep the camera out of the sun as much as possible until you get in the water since the heat will almost definitely make the lens fog.   Edit: I'd say I'm much more casual than a lot of videographers/photographers so they may have different or better advice if you're looking for really superior footage in terms of lights/mounts/filters but I found that the above works for just getting some cool video."
scuba,32kf3x,openzeus,3,Tue Apr 14 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"wrist strap   I like a wrist mount on my left hand. It is kind of a glove with a mount on top.  Generally, I don't like to take a cam with me, too many accessories make me feel like a Christmas tree with different crap hanging. I have enough of dive needed accessories already. But, out of all, I found a wrist mount to be most fitting."
scuba,32kf3x,texasguy911,2,Tue Apr 14 15:08:57 2015 UTC,I tried a wrist strap the previous time when I went snorkling up in Taganga and it felt really uncomfortable to me. I think I'll go with a selfie pole since most people have advised against a head strap for several reasons (the ones /u/openzeus mentioned + bubbles getting infront of the lens + risk of it falling off + just general uncomfy-ness). Thanks for your response though!
scuba,32kf3x,RedToby,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the advice, really helpful! I'm just a casual photographer as well, and on top of that a poor student, so I'll take cheaper equipment which will get me pretty good footage over expensive equipment with amazing footage. I'll go after the different accessories you've mentioned and see if I can find them anywhere near me. I have had trouble finding spare batteries for GoPro already so I hope I will have more luck now. Colombia sucks for electronics :( They are expensive and often hard to find."
scuba,32kf3x,carsgobeepbeep,2,Tue Apr 14 15:09:20 2015 UTC,Can you have Wasabi batteries shipped from Amazon or elsewhere?  There are arguably better than the GoPro original batteries.
scuba,32kf3x,carsgobeepbeep,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"My family is coming to visit me from the Netherlands before the dive, so if I can't find them in Colombia I'll just order them to the Netherlands and then ask them to bring them over with them."
scuba,32kf3x,EatDiveFly,4,Wed Apr 15 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"No need for Scuba housing on GoPro 3+ or 4 unless you are going very deep: the stock housing is rated to 130ft (it should say this right on the package).  Red filter = absolutely required for good footage below ~10ft. Get it. Don't forget to take it off for surface / out of water footage and pics.  I recommend an extra battery and an external charger, and as many extra memory cards as you think you need (probably just one if you plan to download everything to a computer on your lunch break). Plan to swap your cards and your battery during your surface intervals -- your primary battery then charges up top while you dive with the second and vice versa. If you won't have access to a power source on the boat / on your surface interval, also consider one of those giant 16000mah power bank USB charger batteries which should be good for a full day of GoPro recharges and then you can recharge the power bank itself at the hotel overnight.  Add one of the following:   Pole (extendable or not - up to you - I prefer extendable) with lanyard wrist strap and lanyard diving tray with two handles (warning, these can be expensive. But they allow for the most stable shots.)   If you choose the pole, mount the camera to hang beneath it rather than sit on top of it, then set the camera to inverted mode. This will give you better control and more stable shots because the weight of the camera isn't fighting gravity. Practice holding it out of water so you are less task loaded in the water."
scuba,32kf3x,RedToby,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! I have been having a hard time finding spare batteries here in Colombia so far but I will continue my search. I don't think there is any electricity on the boat. Hell, I'm not even sure if there will be regular electricity on the island, so a USB charger should be a good idea.   If you choose the pole, mount the camera to hang beneath it rather than sit on top of it, then set the camera to inverted mode.   You mean to basically have it upside down on the pole? That's a great tip, thanks! Any more of these tips are always welcome :)"
scuba,32kf3x,phatbrasil,3,Tue Apr 14 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"You mean to basically have it upside down on the pole?   Yep, exactly. The flip option is easily accessed through the capture settings menu. Hold the handle with one hand, and very loosly ""cup"" the pole mid-length with your other hand so that it balances and settles naturally via gravity. I've found this allows for a more stable shot than trying to death-grip the whole rig. Poles are nice because they are easy to hand off and can get the camera in much closer to fish before you spook them off with bubbles and your looming silhouette. But if I had the    ...having a hard time finding...   I got everything I needed off the internet. Amazon specifically, but eBay is generally okay too. I'm in the US though so can't help you there.   other tips   Maybe get a cheapo $6 mini tripod for time lapses on the beach. I wouldn't spend a cent more though; this is literally the only thing you'll use it for."
scuba,32kf3x,patkonglion,3,Tue Apr 14 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"As much as it frees up your hands, don't opt for the head mount.  I used to use one for video and it you'll find that you flit your head back and forth up and down way to often to make useful video.  you can set it on 1 pic every X seconds and then get in the habit of staring at things long enough for a good shot to happen.  That has proved a little bit useful.  I personally only use a stick nowadays.  useful for eel in a cave and lobster in a cave shot.  Also fish tend to let the pole get closer than you and your big body.  And the real trick is, to get as close as possible."
scuba,32kf3x,tramster,3,Tue Apr 14 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to buck the trend and say I'm not a fan of filters. It's very easy to get mediocre results with a filter, but if you have the software and the skill, it is much better to fix the color in post processing.   With a filter you are stuck at one particular shade and density of red for the whole dive, while actually, the amount of red underwater will gradually fade as you go deeper. Things are going to look too red near the surface, maybe good around 30ft, or wherever that red density of the filter is calibrated, and not red enough at greater depths.  And that assumes the shade of red is right for that water. Greenish water benefits from a more magenta colored filter.    Lastly, all filters are reducing to some extent the amount of light that makes it to the sensor. In a lower light environment like underwater, you need all the light you can get.  If you can calibrate the white balance and adjust the levels specifically for each clip, you'll come out with better looking footage IMO."
scuba,32kf3x,patkonglion,3,Wed Apr 15 08:33:55 2015 UTC,"to be fair, I agree with you but at the same time its kind of a lot of work to get everything right and I have neither the skill nor the time to make the footage look awesome. I feel that a red filter is a good compromise."
scuba,32kf3x,diCkShakin,2,Wed Apr 15 09:54:10 2015 UTC,Get a handle mount. You can hold it with two hands and better stabilize the camera. A red filter is a must. Lights help but they can get very expensive. Backscatter has a good handle and filters for the gopro
scuba,32kf3x,Sunfish_funfish,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:00:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. It seems like Backscatter doesn't deliver to my country (Colombia) and they don't have stores here. I'll see if I can find anything second hand on the web though. What do you mean by handle mount exactly? Googling the term gives me a variety of very different mounts.

They have busses to pick up & drop off divers from most of the hotels in Shrarm.   Ant reason why you need the dive shop in the resort?  Or as others have said... considered a liveaboard?  Haven't done one myself but hear you get the best dive sites well before any of the dayboats get there each day and it's about the same price as an all-inclusive hotel & dayboat diving package of the same length.

They are a great bunch, they make you feel very welcome and they know their stuff!  I stay at the Iberotel Il Mercato, it's a great hotel. I wouldn't have thought diving with a hotel would be better then diving with a dedicated diving company. A liveaboard sounds like it would be ideal if you want an all in one solution as there isn't much to do on the mainland anyway. I still dive with Elite because I've met friends through them and the staff are great fun.

I know it's not close to London but it's so good, get a boat to Lundy Island it's a Marine Conservation Zone and the seals are really playful."
scuba,32kdzl,Sunfish_funfish,2,Tue Apr 14 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"Babbacombe is a fair bit closer and still gets seals. Still not really south east, mind. Paging /u/nigelh !"
scuba,32kdzl,jonny_boy27,2,Tue Apr 14 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Never dived Babbercombe. My seal encounters have been at the Farne Islands and in the Outer Hebrides. The average younger seal seems like a rather dumb puppy. ""Oh look it's a diver. Let's go and have a look."" The older one's just ignore you.  Obligatory seal photograph."

scuba,32kdzl,jonny_boy27,2,Tue Apr 14 21:04:30 2015 UTC,Nope. Sorry. Brighton on the Costa Silt. No seals here. We're just hoping for a week or so of clear before the local plankton discovers sun AND nitrate run-off and goes mad.
scuba,32ith3,openzeus,6,Tue Apr 14 03:17:35 2015 UTC,Just got back from diving in Belize. During the safety stop on one of the dives this remora was getting a little frisky with all of us and even bumped into my gopro a few times. One of the group who had a tendency to swim off on her own came zooming back at the end of the dive with this thing chasing her. She had no idea what it was so I had a good laugh as everyone else was sort of freaking out about what this weird fish was and what it wanted.   Edit: He was pretty big too. Human for scale.
scuba,32ith3,Goonie_GooGoo,9,Tue Apr 14 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"Dropped in on a school (100+) of them once.    My initial thoughts were: Remoras usually hang around big fish, like sharks.  And this is a LOT of remoras.  [look around furtively] I don't see anything big around.  Does that mean something(s) bigger/more aggressive is around?  Something(s) that killed/ate/scared off a bunch of sharks/mantas/whalesharks?    Others in the group didn't seem worried/freaked out.  Dive guides seemed calm.  At some point, one stuck to a guy's butt/thigh, and another was chasing a chick rather persistently, but no harm no foul.  The school stuck with us for a good 15+ minutes before swimming off."
scuba,32ith3,PorkyJack,8,Tue Apr 14 07:14:22 2015 UTC,You were the big fish in that situation.

scuba,32ith3,SrRoundedbyFools,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:32:55 2015 UTC,I hate divers who aren't diving the plan.  I called out a retired couple who repeatedly completely failed to follow instructions and stay with the group.  I felt bad for the dive guide after their briefings had emphasized over and over to stay together.  Everyone but the couple could read between the lines that they were the ones being reminded. At one point the man swam off the reef out into the blue chasing a manta for his video and completely ignored his depth.   The guide had to go get him - changing the guides profile while everyone else stayed around 60'.    It's a shitty spot to put a dive guide in.  They're working for tips for their company and trying to make sure everyone is safe. I laid into the guy verbally for about three minutes straight about how his negligence was unwelcome and he needed to tip the boat very well for being a problem diver.  When we got back to the dock I went and found the store manager and pointed out her employees were being ignored and placed in hazardous situations and asked her to pull the couple aside and talk to them about crew/diver safety.    I went on a night dive the next day and got a few high fives and thumbs up from other divers and crew.
scuba,32ith3,withfishes,3,Fri Apr 17 04:01:35 2015 UTC,Looks like a loafer
scuba,32ith3,xblackdog,3,Tue Apr 14 03:17:58 2015 UTC,Best way to deal with a remora that won't leave you alone is to start chasing it yourself. They kind of freak out when the tables are turned on them. And it turns an annoying dive experience into a funny one.
scuba,32ith3,comanon,2,Tue Apr 14 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"Those things are crazy. My fourth dive in Belize one kept biting at our group. In this video it had just bit her in the back of the head lol. IIRC one guy was bleeding a bit form his ear. Not sure why it was following us, but the whole dive it was with us."

scuba,32ith3,Bigwhistle,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"The remora just knows that you'll eat sooner or later. It's nothing personal, you're just transportation."

scuba,32kwxt,L00kBehindYou,3,Tue Apr 14 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"You can try Vallarta undersea, is my ""go to"" operator; if you have your mind made about the operator; ask to go to Marietas Islands, is a 40 min boat ride from the pier. Los Arcos is the most iconic dive in Vallarta, just be aware of the snorkelers, is a very relaxed dive. Mahauitas is good dive too."
scuba,32kwxt,Kant2099,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"This is the best operator in my opinion. If you are not a new diver, ask to go to El Morro (about 10 minutes past marietas) or El Chimo. they are both deep dives with some current.  For more relaxed dives, Marietas, los arcos and mahauitas are great"
scuba,32kwxt,dissaster,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:32:05 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be for you to have fun. But I've been known to give unsound advice.
