I'll never understand the pure disdain some people have (nerds and hipsters, generally) when something they like becomes popular and trendy.  The things I enjoy, I enjoy because I see the value in it. In that video, I don't see people joining in because ""it's popular now and I have to do what's popular.""  I see them joining in because enough people are doing it that they no longer feel uncomfortable standing out in a crowd. They're enjoying themselves, and that's something to be happy about.  To take it back to the nerd culture which is what got that guy so riled up apparently, when super heroes blew up in popularity a few years back, everyone started asking me questions since I actually am familiar with comic books. I was never under the impression people wanted to know more about comic books because they were popular now.  It's the fact that they've gained more popularity that made them realize that comics aren't just cheesy things for kids. There's some good stuff in that genre that's worth looking into, and that's a good thing for nerds because it means it's now more profitable to make nerd merchandise. We benefit from it."

I played soccer a fair bit growing up and still enjoy watching it, but other than illegitimate streaming sites it's pretty hard to find a game these days. Most people aren't willing to find an illegal sports streaming site and filter through all the BS to stream a soccer game. However when America is playing in the WC, you can turn on just about any major news/sports channel and find the game or at least highlights.   Also people like watching big sporting events. I don't sit down every week to watch Sunday/Monday football (american football), but I always reschedule/adjust my plans to watch the Super Bowl, because it's a spectacle."

I think most of the people here don't care about the world cup, but since we did so well this last time, everyone jumped on it. I don't know if I view this mentality negatively or not.

videos,3e22lc,bomag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"There's a thing called a CAN-BUS system on modern cars.  It works similarly to USB, in that you can connect everything in the car in to the ECU with simple plugs and data cables, rather than the massive cables you'd need if everything was sent analogue.  This means you can have extra functionality too, because when your tail lights are controlled by a CAN-BUS system it means that the ECU will know when a bulb has blown and which one, which is pretty difficult with an older analogue system.  So the main benefit of CAN-BUS is system feedback, which is pretty critical in the super-complex electrical systems of modern cars.    However the downside is that issues and problems can travel around the CAN-BUS system.  So an issue with your entertainment system, for example, might send your tail lights nuts.  Or a faulty sensor in the engine might make the boot pop open when you're driving along.  The other problem is that once you have access to the ECU through a weak link, in this case the entertainment system, you then have complete and total access to every CAN-BUS controlled system on the car.    I like my older cars personally.  My car has OBDII (data interface between an external computer and the car's ECU) which is useful for engine diagnostics and tweaking with fuelling and the like, but pretty much nothing aside from the engine management is tied to the ECU.  Everything else is standalone."

The many CAN systems would be, for the most part, completely separate from each other (and unable to communicate) if they weren't interconnected at a sort of public translator/communicator called a gateway. Not only is the entertainment system connected to all other subsystems, but in many cars, the head unit (or the infrastructure that supports it) contains the gateway"

videos,3e22lc,ragingduck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"They fucked up but it's more complicated then that. This discussion probably benefits from a crash course/ELI5 in CAN networks.  [ELI5] Imagine you John and Mary are all sitting on the same row of chairs and you circulate letters, all letters have the actual content and an ID on the edge of the message. Everyone is allowed to look at the message ID but you are only allowed to read messages with an ID that matches your 'reading' list. Likewise you are able to write messages but you can only send them with an ID that is on your 'writing' list. So say you are able to write messages with ID 'apples' and another message with ID 'pears', likewise you can only read messages with the ID 'oranges' ; John is only able to write messages with ID 'oranges' but is able to read messages with ID 'apples', 'pears', 'watermelon'. Mary doesn't like you guys very much and only writes messages with ID 'watermelon' and doesn't listen to none of you.  In a vehicle Each node 'computer' will have a list of message ID's it's allowed to broadcast and a list of message ID's it's meant to listen for. So as an example the Radio/Navigation will probably have a set of messages that allows it to communicate with Speedometer and Air Conditioning units.   Additionally to this there are typically multiple buses (different rows of chairs). So on one bus you might have speedometer, Air conditioning, and Radio/Navigation. On another bus you might have ABS and Electronic Stability Control, and on another your engine management nodes. Each separate bus, will communicate with other buses via a gateway controller that should segregate non authorised ID's.   So there was probably two points of failure:   The Radio/Infotainment unit was allowed to send Messages outside of it's 'writing' list (this is probably where the hackers did most of there work). So the radio has been hacked in a way that allows it to write messages with ID 'apples' and 'pears' but now can also send messages with any ID (any word in the dictionary). Additionally to that the gateway architecture should not have allowed those rogue messages to be transmitted from an 'unexpected' bus. The gateway should have effectively dropped that message and not retransmit to the engine bus. Continuing the analogy if your buddy Harry is sitting in between two rows of chairs and is only meant to pass on messages with 'Watermelon' to the back row; if it suddenly receives a message with 'quesadillas' (sent by a 'zombified' John) it should not retransmit this message to the back row of chairs.    So yes it's a serious problem that showcases what happens when you mix ignorance & complacency with marketing pressures for 'hot' new tech. Ultimately connectivity should be handled with the same criticality as the life-saving safety-critical systems in the vehicle."

videos,3e22lc,Cessno,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Its not just the lack of safety in the network, its the computer itself having the power to make the decisions.  Yes computers have excellent reaction time and can monitor many variables at once. But reaction time is not everything. The problem lies in the unpredictability of driving. Even a computer will not be ready for it. And most of all, it wont be ready for the decision making that goes into driving. What is the primary directive of the self driving car? Is it to avoid accidents at all costs? Is it to obey traffic laws at all costs? Is it to ensure safety at all costs? Those things cannot happen simultaneously at all times. So the computer will have to prioritize.  So for example to avoid an accident you may have to break a traffic law right? But how far are we willing to let self driving cars go? Take this scenario: You driving along in your self driving car and someone runs into the street without looking. Regardless of reaction time, cars cannot stop on a dime. Its going to hit that person. So will it hit the brakes and hit that person at a slower speed or swerve out of the way? What if it swerve out of the way, hits a ditch and your car flips over an rolls down an embankment? So you probably want safety to be first. But for who? Does the car protect the driver, its owner, at all costs? Or will it sacrifice your safety for the 'greater good'?  Is the safety of me and my passengers always the top priority of this computer? Or will it sacrifice my safety to save a bus load of kids? But what if I dont want my (the driver's) safety to be top priority? My wife and kids are in the car. If the car has a split second to swerve to make the impact less severe, who will it be less severe for? Will it protect the driver at all costs?  Given the right set of circumstances, will this machine make the conscious decision to endanger the life of my passenger in order to save me?  The completely autonomous vehicle that reddit seems to think is coming down the pipeline is nothing more than a pipe dream at this point. People will reject this technology when the figure out the implications it has. Its like airplanes, they have the power to run completely on their own but will always require two humans just in case. The same goes for cars.  Will a self driving car do what is logical or what is right or will it do what I tell it to?"

More on topic of this post:  What if a hacker with more malicious intentions decided to lock your doors crack your windows and drive you into the nearest river?  What if this happens en masse? Hackers taking over thousands of cars remotely and crashing them in the right places will cripple a cities' transportation system for days.

So say you have a new song that is a bit slow. You think it's around 50-70 bpm so as a starting point first you tap at 120bpm, which you have a good feel for, and then halve it to 60. But maybe your new song seems a bit faster than this so you up it to 75. Boom, you got your tempo.  I don't know what this would be useful for.

The WBC would picket every time a student would die at my high school (because they were fags, of course), and we'd all encircle their pitiful protests. My favorite anti-protest was when +700 students and townspeople surrounded their 20 person picket.  We all had picket signs that said 'I'm Cuckoo For Cocoa Puffs', and we just marched around Mr. Phelps and his family shouting 'IIIIIII'M CUCKOOOOOOO FOR COCOA PUFFS'. Then people started sling-shotting condoms at them and the police had to step in.  Still a fun memory.  edit: I should say, not all of the WBC protests were over dead HS students, but a good majority of the students were kids of soldiers stationed at Ft. Riley (a good 15mins away). So they'd 'protest' the funerals of dead soldiers to make a point about faggots or something (to this day, I can't get their agenda straight). Needless to say, there were a lot of dead Americans in that town."

If you're using the term it's because you want to connect to your heritage but ""Nigerian American"" or something like it was taken from you. Charlize's country of origin wasn't taken from her."

You can hear allegra's (actual, lesbian) girlfriend (middle seat) 2:23 taking offense, followed by ""[something] my girlfriend"". Luke ignores her and keeps going with the routine. Apparently Allegra was laughing, which made her girlfriend jealous or angry, and I think that combined with him ignoring her just made her more angry. I really don't think it's about the cream cheese. I think it's someone who wanted to be offended and didn't get her chance to make it known, so she had to do something more drastic. Its important to note it wasn't Allegra who poured the drink."

But really, if I have these ""limits"" then I would not put myself on a situation like an comedy show.   I feel no sympathy for anyone who gets offended at these.

Your classic '9-5er, let's get married and have 2 kids, glad to be called a consumer'-type doesn't stop to ask these kinds of questions very often and don't like to see the things that the person in that clip is pointing out. They just simply say: 'ewww cringe...le edgy' in order to shuffle away the idea and feeling that there might be truth in the statements and their life is a lie to some degree.  There is so much beauty in this existence after you ponder and accept the absurdity of it all; when you see that what they claim to be true is smoke and mirrors you then begin to see the truth of it all.  I don't think negatively of  anyone, even the ones who think negatively of this perspective I hold. Everyone's on their own path and if they choose to believe the smoke and mirrors are true then that's up to them.

videos,3e117z,TrapandRelease,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"Well here is my view on this series then:  I gave this telly show a try, since it was really highly rated (Mr. Robot and TD are both at 9.3 rating) -- like True Detectives (season 1, haven't watched 2). I quit after the first episode (perhaps the second -- can't remember).  TD was interesting because it was influenced by actual philosophers (Cioran and Ligotti) and had a rather original dark theme. I do not buy the claim that it tries to make philosophical pessimism or anti-natalism cool for the masses -- like Dexter does not try to make mischievous murder cool.   Mr. Robot on the other hand... but heh, it is not my taste. I can remember some occasional poke against society and capitalism in the first (and second?) episode. They are basically planning to turn society in an anarchic state by deleting all debts (or something?) -- followed by a self-congratulatory smirk on their faces, as if that would be a heroic act. I would claim that society/civilisation is one of the most beautiful thing in the world. So, the autistic anarchistic/libertarian-socialistic theme didn't appeal to me at all."

And I get that. Being a young dude who feels powerless can cause some people to start projecting the self-hatred back on society. And you can see that in him. He's angry at himself on how his anxiety gets the better of him. It's a typical ""You're a wizard, Harry!"" pilot. I've only watched episode 1, so I hope they keep his personality, without trying to force him into a stereotypical misunderstood hero. But then again, the opening scene involves him outing a paedo to the police."

The key though, is to accept it and realize that those are not problems you alone can conquer, those are large issues that require a specific moment in history to accomplish. I try to focus on what I can do for others and what I can do to progress at any given moment.

You shouldn't belittle social media and the connectedness it brings like minded people from all around the world and it adding some form of intimacy that otherwise would not exist with others we would never know. You can't just look at the shitty things and curl up into a ball. You look at what produces them so you can see if they can be fixed, and when you look if they are being fixed you will see that there are dedicated organizations dedicated to making this fix a reality more times then not. Far more people care than you think, and things couldn't function if this force did not naturally exist as a part of man's nature.

videos,3e117z,Trachtas,8,Tue Jul 21 10:36:07 2015 UTC,"It's ""edgy"" because  it's just one step removed from the naivety of childhood.  Look at one quote:   ""All our heroes are counterfeit""   Adults recognise that everybody is carrying demons and dealing with their own problems. Nobody is Superman, nobody is shiny and good (and successful) through and through. It's not just foolish, it's stupid to think otherwise. If you can contain contradictions, so can everybody else.  A child idealises someone on the basis of one redeeming quality. The ""edgy"" teenager condemns them on the basis of one flaw. Someone with real life experience though knows to acknowledge and come to terms with the multi-faceted nature of everybody.  To expect your heroes to be perfect, to not have ""counterfeit"" aspects to them, is laughably naive.  And then, alright, the specific ""heroes"" invoked in that clip:   Steve Jobs Lance Armstrong Bill Cosby Mel Gibson   A businessman, a sportsman, and two entertainers.  I'm not going to defend their character, but is there a reason we should've expect them to be moral exemplars? Except via the transitive reasoning of a child (""He's good at acting"" => ""He's good generally""), no. Should we have expected anything more of them other than their ability to manage a company/make people laugh/win races?  An adult isn't someone who outgrows role models. It's someone who freely chooses who their role models will be. The only reason anyone would single one of those four guys out is because The TV -- the deindividuated shapeshifting voice of not-me-but-somebody -- paid attention to them at one point or another. Does that mean they deserve to be your heroes?  These complexities, this murkiness of good and bad co-existing side by side and not just cancelling each other like matter and anti-matter, this lack of easy paragons and paths, that isn't proof the world is doomed or false or phony. That's just Reality, it's an inevitable consequence of freedom, and desire, and insight, and ethics. There's no way it could be otherwise. Even Disney World has its underground.   Nothing that was mentioned in the video was false.   Because that's not how these things work, you don't get ""false"" and ""bad"" and ""edgy"" and ""nasty"" lined up on one side, and ""true"" and ""good"" and ""mature"" and ""pleasant"" on the other.

To realize that idea can be an emotionally powerful experience.  One can then be angry at 'society', feeling they've been lied to about the nature of things, and take the (perhaps erroneous and equally simplistic) approach that all of society is lies, liars, and fools-- I think may be what you mean by 'pristine idealism, lashing out at its own bruising'.

I mean, to keep the rant going, another part of adulthood is realising things don't line up as neat'n'simple ""true OR false"" but as ""true; truer; kind of true; more true than; partially true; true for my current situation; especially true; true but misleading; true for someone with this background; true-ish; true in the context of...""

And society was me driving to Advanced Auto Parts last Sunday to buy a replacement solenoid for my 1981 ford F-100 truck for less than two hours minimum wage. Think about the mass network of shipping containers, truck drivers, storage units, unique ID numbers, sql databases, everything going all the way back to the original assembly from parts half way across the world. Fuck all of that? No. Stand in humble awe.  Want to talk about any of those things more in depth? Want to talk about prescription drug abuse? Want to talk about popular books? Want to talk about Chinese industry? Want to talk about social media? Lets talk! Pick one of those topics and I'm sure me and a few other of societies ""mindless drones"" could have a complicated conversation about a complicated issue.  But you don't want to talk, not like that. You don't want a conversation. You want a monologue. One where you're the only one who sees the true nature of the world, one where everyone else is a bunch of sheep pawn peasants, one where you're the only one who seems to (sniff sniff) give a damn about the world.  What are the odds. Everyone else, those sheep you talk about, they have hobbies. They collect coins and brew their own beer and watch football. They have actually instigated some change in their lives, or at least contributed in some way shape or form. Not that I know the context for these bullshit high school ""I've experienced more pain than you"" shows, but it looks like you're consuming some free or parent paid shrink time.  You know, I'll admit, I was this little bitch ass punk. In middle school. I wore a fake metal chain around my neck and listened to God awful slipknot. Know why? It's simple really. Personal strength comes from trauma. It's how your immune system gets strong, it's how you get emotionally strong as well. You experience pain and hardship, you build up a resistance to it, you build character Calvin.  And why then are all those emotionally pampered kids talking about pain and society like they have some great insight. What are the odds? That a 15 year old has had more traumatic life experience than a 50 year old? How fucking statistically likely is that?  It's clear what it is. The emo phase, the punk rock phase, the death metal phase, and the overly extended ""Fuck society, global warming, everything is racist and homophobic and sexist"" phase that sometimes lasts even after college. It's children pretending to be adults using their limited personal experience. It's like an 8th grader bullying other kids because his limited life experience tells him masculinity is power over others. Or it's a freshman college chick getting drunk and dancing slutty on the table because her limited experience tells her femininity is sexual enticement of men.  tldr: Fuck society? No, fuck you!"

If you want to have a hair cut like that though it's high maintenance. You have to get a haircut every 4-5 1-3 weeks.   Edit: Like many people have said, a undercut requires 1 to 3 weeks maintenance.

videos,3e2dqh,3DGrunge,3,Tue Jul 21 18:02:36 2015 UTC,Try every two weeks... the sides are usually a 1 or .5 so after a week or so they grow fast and ruin the cut. This style has to have the sides ultra short all the time to look good. Best thing is to find a cheap barber who you teach how to do this. $25-30 every couple weeks isnt so bad.

videos,3dyt8n,Nilla_Thunder,12,Tue Jul 21 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"oh my fucking god the review ""When I bought this TV, I at first thought I may be spending a little to much on a TV. But, then I figured I would just go full Zuckerberg and buy it on a whim. When it arrived inside the box was a small Filipino boy named Pepe Tatum. I was shocked at first but then I realized why; he was there of course to guide me on my spirit journey I was about to embark on. Pepe spoke only in short phrases similar to a twitter conversation. I suppose this how he learned english so well. Pepe told me I would soon learn the meaning of life inside this TV. Pepe then went to work constructing my new TV. While he was doing this I did what any good secret trillionaire would and hired three escorts, a little person and proceeded to both make love and murder them. Once the bodies were taken care of I came back into my modest TV room and found Pepe had the system up an running. He handed me a remote the size of a newborn El Chupacabra. He then whispered in my ear “Dreams are what TVs are made of” at first I thought the whisper was a little moist but then asked why end a sentence on a preposition. He smiled and said look to the TV I turned to look at the set and up in a puff of smoke Pepe was gone. I felt so alone and not the kind of alone after murdering three hookers and a midget but the kind of alone you feel when a magical Filipino boy vaporizes right in front of you. I shed a tear and quickly remembered I have no emotions and resorbed that pesky pesky tear.  After recovering quickly from emoting too much I did look to the TV, I began walking closer and closer until my nose was touching the TV. All of the sudden I couldn’t retract from the screen, there was force more powerful than anything a fist full of ketamine could ever accomplish. I was being transformed from an analog into a digital person. I became one with the TV in an instant. I felt the digital content poor over me like warm virgin butter milk. There was no sound and beautiful colors surrounding me, embracing me in warm array. I lost track of time and space for what seemed to be hours if not days. Finally I started walking around and soon realized I was inside the mind of a space squid. Yes a space squid; I had no idea they were even around any more either. The squid told me stories of his travels through time and universes. I asked him if he had any blow and he said not right now check back if a few light days. Squidsy told me to travel to the third realm of the eastern moon in the Fohencian galaxy in the Omicrom quasar. I said cool beans dude. He dropped me off covered in ink as space squids do, and told me as he departed Pepe says his love for you is eternal.  Just to clear up any point of confusion you may have with my review right now; yes I did have sex with Pepe. When one gets a Filipino boy delivered to their house its common place to sex him righteously, as I did.  Back to the review after being filled with what I can only imagine is another pesky emotion called love I grabbed my testicles to feel the only feeling I understand pain and began my journey to the Easter Moon of FG-O quasar. Once inside the eastern moon I realized this place was no normal quasar. I met the thirteen members of quasar republic and they began to interrogate me and question my morals of all things. They showed me How To Love. I was told my Journey began when I was 12 years old living in the foothills of Saskatoon. I was informed that when I was younger my emotions, empathy and capacity to feel was removed to make me capable of becoming the Earth’s first trillionaire. Apparently according the Counsel of the Enlightened Thirteen no one with a functioning brain could possibly handle being a trillionaire on CuntSamich 9 or as we know it Earth. I couldn’t help but wonder and rightfully ask why not leave my emotions alone and see if I could have become a trillionaire still. They then showed me my Darkest time line in which I was still a rich man but only a millionaire. I had family, friends and genuine loved ones. I didn’t rape everyone in my path to reach trillionaire ballar stasis. Apparently rapping the population is essential in developing trillionaire traits and achievements.  Soon with this newly gained Quasar-rithian knowledge cube I began to feel. A flood of emotions and thoughts came running into my mind hole like so much squid seamen. I was overwhelmed and elated, tears began pouring down my face. I can only describe my experience to you as what the Hunter in the movie Powder felt when Powder touched him and the deer in that one scene you know when Powder was being a classic Powder. Anywho, I now was filled with all the emotions of a normal human being. I realized the err in my ways, I was now an enlightened trillionaire. Immediately I imploded. I became a black hole. I now was creating quasar galax-i and weaving dreams of many.  I was the all encompassing light being of indeterminate sexual origins. I enveloped myself and teleported back to my TV room. There I was standing in front of the vary TV set that allowed me to embark on the Greatest Journey the world has ever known. I was a being of the universe now capable of anything and knowing all and feeling all. I was a Jesi and a Disciple of the Universe Light. I then in an instant looked down and saw that Pepe only gave me one pair of 3D Active Glasses. Can you believe it 1 pair of 3D Glasses inexcusable. 4 Stars! Gives me my other pair of Glasses Pepe!!!!!!!!!  4 Stars!"""

See their throat passes through their head and their brain is like a doughnut surrounding the throat. So in order to not inflict brain damage on themselves they have to eat tiny bits at a time with their razor sharp beak. You'd be eaten tiny bit by tiny bit all while drowning and having tentacles and hooks rip at your flesh and yes colossal squid have hooks and not suckers.

People never imagined that one could swim with Humboldt squid and survive but then it emerged that their fearsome reputation was entirely down to the only time humans interacted with them was to catch them en masse with hooks. This activity traumatises the squid and so they ""panic"" and attack each other and anyone else nearby. Encountering them outside that environment has shown them to be curious and non hostile.

You can walk around a submarine like a person in that game, and you can go up on the deck where only a flimsy little wire prevents you from being washed overboard, and in stormy weather giant waves can wash up on the boat, and the first few times it happened I swear for a split second I forgot I was playing a video game and my life flashed before my eyes.

I can't look at videos or photo's of sharks and whales that are near the water surface because it really freaks me to fuck out. Edit: This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8xXnVkOGsA of the Bigfin Squid. I clicked on the video to get the link but I refuse to look at it ever again.  That video that was posted up above somewhere, of the deep sea squid thing with the long arms that make it look like an alien really freaked me the fuck out. T_T  But at the same time I freak out just as much if I know there are giant critters potentially near me in the water and I can't see them (for whatever reason).  Thus, I refuse to go near the ocean. Haven't been to the beach in over a decade and I don't go the lakes either.

Apologizing for the few mistakes you do make when you're under pressure only pushes you further into the right. Acknowledging that you're not perfect even when confronted with a situation where you're clearly the more level headed person is a great way to improve yourself. If you use people who knock at your door to threaten and swear at you as a basis for what your behaviour should be compared to, you set a far lower standard for yourself than you ought to. Nothing wrong with apologizing, it's a super respectable thing to do.  Aspiring to be better than you are is never ""fucked up"". That said, I am Canadian, so perhaps my perspective on the value of apologies is slightly different from most."

Which he acknowledged probably weren't helpful. While you can look at those people point that stuff out and say they're just being dicks, if you want to actually have a conversation about conflict, you shouldn't be talking from the perspective of the aggressive asshole, you should be talking from the perspective of the level headed person who is trying to diffuse the situation.   I hope nobody who would even bother posting on these comment chains flies off the hook at someone as the woman did in the video, but I'm sure a vast majority of those here will at some point over the course of their lives be dealing with an unjustly angry person. By having a conversation about how best to handle those scenarios which are innately difficult to handle with tact, everyone involved comes out better prepared by having spent the time to think about it. OP did a pretty good job, but we can still talk about how he could have done a better job without it being an insult to him."

I don't have a Facebook, Twitter, etc. either. The thing that about those sites is that you always have to tailor your comments to the lowest common denominator so as not to upset anyone. For example, in real life I know the appropriate time and place to tell a dirty joke, but in social media ""time and place"" are a blurry mess. Everyone can see that joke and even go back to it months or years later and view it without any context. At this point it's just best not to post anything at all."

videos,3dz3w2,darkvoid7926,23,Tue Jul 21 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"Because the state of race relations in the U.S. essentially guarantees that any confrontation between a white person and any other race will result in someone (usually the white person involved) being called a racist.   Oddly enough the original post indicated that the alleged antagonist in this situation, a black woman, was racist. This is interesting because many people believe that minorities cannot be racist because they view racism as an extension of policies and social norm we in the United States experience.   They would argue that a minority group which doesn't statistically receive the same socioeconomic opportunities as another racial group is functionally incapable of racism. So, the woman calling a white man ""snowflake"" or ""cracker"" is not actually racist.  Because of this ideology some people may view the original video (entitled ""crazy racist neighbor"")  and conclude that the white man in the video posted it (which he didn't). And that his accusations of racism in the title is in fact a racist behavior.  This is not an argument or an ideology I agree with. I am just attempting to explain why someone may watch that video and decide that he was racist.   I personally believe that every person is capable of racism and that any attempt to excuse racist language or behavior in any way is detrimental to race relations. The woman in the video was clearly quite comfortable making this issue into one about race and clearly concluded that whatever he was doing that bothered her must relate to the fact that he is white."
videos,3dz3w2,HadriansBall,33,Tue Jul 21 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"The real reason he was being called a racist is way less political ...   it's because the guy who posted the video to reddit before the repost went to the front page (not the guy in the video) was an actual racist.  Like he was an actual moderator of r/coontown . People mistook that guy for the guy in the video so they called him a racist. They are two different people.

So I adjusted my behavior last week at a taco bell because I didn't want to be considered a racist.  I'm 29 and white (for context) and would have acted completely different if the kid was white that tried to pull this shit I saw last week.  I'm the 3rd order in line in the store when this (for context) black kid around 14 or so comes in the store after riding around with a buddy on a bicycle.  Kid wants a water cup (if you're not a paying customer...I don't think anyone should be offended if you use the bathroom faucets, as I would probably do as etiquette)  The kid cuts the line asking for a cup for water.  The employee looks confused and goes to talk to another to come back to let the kid know he has to buy something.  (fair enough...go use the bathroom then)....  The kid tries to butt in front of two other parties ordering to buy a $1 taco or something to get a water cup (rude)....and because he was black I let this slide.  If he was a white kid I'd have confronted him about placing his order in queue as appropriate.  When he wasn't being helped....he then went and helped himself to the drink machine.  He put his mouth on the nozzle and drank water in front of about 8 customers.  I felt like I couldn't rebuke this kid because I'd immediately get called a racist and then had images of myself on the 6 o'clock news for beating the shit out of a 14 year old as a hate crime."

videos,3dzlok,Welcome2myVillage,91,Tue Jul 21 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"It is my position that Modern Feminism is an example of slave morality, and that as such can only serve to empower women in direct proportion to the amount of actual gender-based oppression they experience, and that in the absence of a strong, coherent and concrete male master class, the inherent re-sentiment of feminism is incapable of empowering anyone.  What I mean is that as a society approaches equality, the tools feminism provides for the empowerment of women become increasingly less useful and ineffective.  I would argue that we have already reached and passed the point in history (at least in the West) at which feminisms diminishing returns become overwhelmed by the inherent limiting nature of slave morality.  Slave morality is fundamentally dis empowering because slave morality makes no allowances for the possibility of a person to act on their own agency and exercise their will to power.  Slave morality, but its nature, must necessarily condemn agency and the will to power, as these are the hallmarks of the Master class, and the primary purpose of slave morality is to demonize the Master class.  Thus feminism has no concept of healthy masculinity, seeing masculinity as only a symptom of the Master and thus seeing all hallmarks of masculinity as oppressive.  This is highly problematic, since traditional masculinity is a form of master morality intended to prepare boys for their potential roles as leaders of men.  Thus, traditional masculinity places extreme emphasis on personal responsibility for one's actions, honor as an assurance of good faith and trustworthiness, and stoicism in the face of hardship and pain.  The man who whines constantly about his disadvantages, blames others for his failures, and insists on being rewarded and praised for existing is defined by traditional masculinity as a loser, as not really a man.  A generation of women who came of age in a time when legal and social barriers made it impossible for women to excel developed feminism as a critique and deconstruction of traditional masculine gender bias, and launched a widespread series of social changes that resulted in full legal equality for women.  The generation that followed them was raised, male and female alike, with a belief in social equality.  Yet, women do not yet posses equality of outcomes with men.  Men are still more likely to hold political power and economic power.  Why is this?  My suggestion is that it is due largely to feminism, which has failed to adjust its central premises in the face of the end of institutional inequality.  Why are there fewer women in political office than men?  Recent studies have shown little evidence of gender bias amongst voters, and the problem seems to largely come down to one single factor:  Women just don't run for office very often.  In fact, if women had won every single race they participated in during the 2012 elections (which they very nearly did), the make-up of the government would still have been overwhelmingly male.  The traditional feminism response is to seek out blame and find an oppressive force working against women, except there isn't anything there to find.  What's lacking is encouragement to women to seek power.  Something which, not surprisingly, is fundamentally at odds with the worldviews that feminism derives from, in which seeking power is Master morality and inherently anti-feminist.  Thus, strangely, we see some unusual trends in society.  For example, Republican women candidates are, according to surveys, seen as more competent and more qualified as leaders than Democratic women.  I would suggest this is due to the fact that Republican women tend to reject the Woman As Victim, Male As Victimizer model of feminism, and instead see themselves as true equals of men -- every bit as capable of acting on their ambitions and pursuing their will to power as men are. Meanwhile, Democratic women are more likely to embrace feminism and portray women as victims of society, which in turn makes them seem less powerful (as powerful people do not see themselves as victims).  Thus it is my position that modern women, faced with the reality of political and social equality, will never gain equality of outcomes unless they abandon feminism.  So long as they rail against an oppressive state that no longer exists, they cannot truly empower women.  Instead, they can only turn their energies towards more and more frivilous and meaningless displays of ""oppression.""  This is most vividly seen in the blogs of ""Tumblr feminists"" -- young women who, rather than embracing the tremendous freedoms they have and seeking to make meaningful careers for themselves, instead assign themselves to perpetual victim-hood.  They make charting their own victimization, mapping the intersections of their oppression, their primary hobby.  Rather than empower themselves, they scream at the world ""Why won't you empower me!!!""  And no wonder, when the philosophy they embrace defines being a victim as the highest good.  People seek to be good, and if you teach them that being good is being a victim, they will devote their energies not to improving their own standing and achieving their dreams, but rather to proving that they are, in fact, a victim.  This leads only to ""oppression Olympics,"" where different historical out-groups fight amongst themselves over who is the most oppressed, and meanwhile the straight, white men they vilify continue to run the world -- because those straight, white men are the only ones actually expressing any interest in running it.  The modern feminist engages constantly in pointless, aggravating and irritating actions that only serve to make feminism increasingly irrelevant.  Examples would include silly, incomprehensible and pointless forms of protest such as ""Slut Walks,"" censorship campaigns to ban Robin  Thicke's ""Blurred Lines"" (a song that literally has nothing to do with rape), and idiotic complaints about Barbie.  I don't expect this to change any time soon, nor do I expect women to make any significant advances as a class, until the slave-morality of feminism is set aside and a new philosophy, a philosophy of the Uberfrau, develops to take its place."

And what evidence does teepy offer for this very counter-intuitive claim?  teepy claims that the fact that not very women run for office is proof that women have been conditioned by feminism to be passive and not seek power.  This is another ridiculous and counter-intuitive claim, since before feminism women were expected and conditioned to either be homemakers or have service jobs.  Aside from asking us to swallow his a-historical narrative, since teepy tells us that women who do run have an edge and usually win, we must additionally believe that political parties aren't savvy enough to find a few hundred good female candidates to enjoy this advantage and propel their parties to power.  In summary, to accept teepy's position one must ignore or twist the evidence.  He misunderstands what feminism was and is about, choosing to interpret it wrongly as a rejection of what he considers ""male"" values.  Feminism doesn't reject values typically associated with masculinity such as personal responsibility or ambition.  What feminism does do is assert that it is as OK for a women to have or not have these values as it is for a man to have or not have them.  And yet, if teepy is so full of it, why does his message resonate with some?  The answer is that when he criticizes what he mistakenly labels ""feminism"", what he's really criticizing is a caricature of the leftist perspective writ large.  I presume people upvoting him aren't rejecting real feminism so much as the leftist perspective itself.  The left does, for example, downplay the notion of personal responsibility as it pertains to social problems.  This is for a couple reasons; one, because it isn't helpful to blame individuals for social problems.  And two, because the left rejects that everything somehow works out if we all act selfishly.  The left doesn't frame problems in terms of personal responsibility because social problems demand social answers.  If you still aren't convinced, consider that just a few years ago the right considered Bill Cosby to be the ideal black activist.  These people are insane, yo."

To generalize, are men valued because of what they have done, the consequences of their actions, what they have accomplished-- in other words: actuality? Are women valued because what they are, their virtue-- their potentiality? I'm wondering if it's even possible to escape these sets of values. They seem hardwired. Instead of deciding on one way or the other for ALL (either A- to be automatically valued, B- or to EARN value), it seems like the feminists are just broadening the gap between men and women. I think they've reached a plateau where it's impossible to attain any more value, so they have to resort to devaluing men. Maybe this is just another way of looking at the master/slave thing idk."

That being said, the last 4 decades of feminism has instilled a huge sense of entitlement in some women, especially those who identify themselves as hardcore feminists.   I'm pretty familiar with what you're talking about here, but look at rape rates, labor force participation, birth control access, etc. of the 70's and 80's and compare it to now.  The level of equality we see now is recent.     Women need to understand that they have it better than men. Society looks at a women who is struggling and reaches at a hand to help her. Society sees a man struggling and tells him he is pathetic.   Why would that be?  What kind of underlying social value would lead people to believe men are more able to handle their emotions and mental state than women?  What would affirm the idea that women are fragile and need to be protected?    Look at how women are treated throughout history.  The overarching theme is that women are weak and need to be protected.  Feminists have no intention of perpetuating those social values.  What feminist would honestly say it's a good thing men can't feel comfortable speaking of their emotions?    Research reputable feminist organizations and I can guarantee you virtually all of them will agree that the societal values you describe that are held towards men are problematic.  What feminist would uphold societal values that they're trying to fix?   Mental Health issues, financial difficulties or even cancer. Men die a lot sooner, more likely to be homeless, less likely to receive help for mental illness.   Women are more likely to be raped, are more likely to raise a child by themselves, likely to be stalked, and are more likely to be physically abused.  But there is no good reason to use ""X has it better than Y"" in regards to feminism.  Chances are all the issues you bring up would have feminist support to solve.  Again, feminists have no reason to be against fixing the problems men face and they certainly have no reason to perpetuate underlying societal values that create those men's issues because they by definition prolong the women's issues feminists are also trying to solve.   So I'm anti-feminist because todays feminists aren't actually feminist. Yes women are still suffering all over the world BUT NOT IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD.

But instead of these feminists actually going out to help women WHO NEED IT, they go and stop MEN from getting help.   Someone else has it worse, so women's issues in the developed world don't matter?  Is our rape rate among women acceptable?  Amount of stalking?  Domestic violence?  Access to birth control?    Women who need it?  What about rape victims in the US, do they not need any help?  Simply because the West is developed doesn't mean women's or men's issues have disappeared.  Same logic could just be apply to men's issues, economic issues, literally anything.  I could just say ""who gives two shits about the first world's issues, there are people living in slums with no sanitary water and are constantly at risk of civil war.""   Modern day feminism = sexism towards men.   And the type of sexism you describe just further entrenches the societal values that feminism seeks to point out and fix.  Feminists have no reason to push towards a society where women are viewed as weak and men as the strong breadwinner.    And you know Buzzfeed has a lot of feminist writing right?

Even feminists view a man who has it rough as weak because they look at him as privileged.  They will do anything and give any benefit of the doubt to a woman who has it rough though.  Feminists don't do anything to strip themselves of the privilege they have.  They're only concerned with bringing men down from where the feminists believe the man has the privilege, whether that privilege exists or not.    All I ever hear from feminists now is ""the patriarchy the patriarchy it's all the fault of the patriarchy"".  You can literally just throw that word for anything.    Anyway, my whole thing is I think feminists are more sexist to women than I am.  I think feminists don't give women enough credit.  You know what a man does (and has to do) when shit gets rough?  He figures it out.  You know what a WOMAN does?  She figures that shit out.  She fights for herself, because rather than trying to tell everyone she's a 'strong, independant woman' she actually IS a strong independant woman.  You know what a feminist does?

There are so many different types of feminists. We have ones that just completely hate men and wishes pretty much that they overpower men, then we have ones who were previously men but either went through a sex change or crossdress or whatever and turns toward feminism to kill what they perceive as the remaining dregs of their masculinity as men within them. As you can tell, the first group of women won't consider the second group their allies because they were still born men. This is just two different types. Any less hardcore feminists that actually upholds legitimate concerns for equality, not about overpowering the opposite sex, will be drowned out by the loud and vocal hardcore groups. There's no way that they can distance themselves as they can't even be considered a single entity as a group anymore since within the group is a huge variety of types that even oppose each other."

videos,3dzlok,deckchair,3,Tue Jul 21 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"The issue is that feminism used to be about equality of opportunity. By that i mean people wanted women to have the same opportunities as men. But over the years we have seen even with all the opportunities given, women still didn't participate in what was and still are male dominated area's. Most likely its due to both biological and social influences affecting men and women into preferring different things. Even in western countries we are seeing a rise in the amount of women who prefer to stay home as moms.   The feminism of today has been hijacked by people who no longer believe in equality of opportunity but equality of representation. these are not the same. Equality of representation means that there has to be a near 50/50 divide in all area's between men and women. This can never work as Ive stated before men and women like different things. We are seeing this push in the Humanities and social science departments for making us believe that men and women are the same besides their genitals. which is not true because its been proven we work different parts of our brains which are covered in either Estrogen and testosterone. Both of which have very different effects.  So as this new wave of feminism has struggled to get what it wants it has become more and more desperate and uses more and more extreme tactics , which actually serve to push people away from feminism (less of a percentage of people label themselves as such now than previously before).  Until people denounce more vigorously what these people do in these video's and elsewhere we are going to see an ever increasing divide between the groups.   Identity politics is probably one of the worst things to come out of the west in a long while"

videos,3dzlok,TotesMessenger,28,Tue Jul 21 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Like any other doctrine, there will be people who follow it blindly. Like the Bible or socialism. They get dug into their own dogma like a tick and can't be reasoned with.  So feminism is no different than cults or religions or other doctrines in that regard. when they start quoting chapter and verse at you as debate, you know you're talking to a dogmatist.  You are correct about this unfortunately with regards to how feminism has become today, but you do not need to be TOO concerned with feminism. Feminism is it's own worst enemy.  1) The majority of people in the US are moderate in their politics and heterosexual in their orientation. Heterosexual women do not like to have their men vilified. They have husbands, lovers, sons, fathers and brothers. They are perfectly aware of feminism's attempt to make men be viewed as evil and boys as broken. Feminism has gone too far to undermine the male experience and voice, and the backlash among heterosexual women is growing.  2) Feminism is imploding. No two feminists can agree on what feminism is, or what feminism should be doing. The angry men-hating lesbian few are its leaders and its loudest public voice. The second loudest group of feminists are transwomen who subconsciously want to destroy their inner man through undermining all 'remaining' men. Yet group A doesn't acknowledge group B's womanhood, since they were born male with all the privileges thereof. These two most vocal groups are pitted in a struggle to steer feminism's direction.  3) Feminism is becoming a joke to the regular populace. From the uproar over the Sleepwalker art at Wellesley, to the infantilization of women, to the vitriol with which it approaches men, it's losing women, and its losing public support.   4) Feminism is losing the public. With the crisis of false rape claims and false threat reports either made by feminist leaders or supported by feminism, as a movement it no longer has public trust. With horribly misandric campaigns like 'Teach Men Not to Rape' real people understand that women rape too, and that men are victims, and shake their heads in disbelief at its behavior.  5) Feminism has lost men. With a few male allies remaining, men are awakening to feminism's intention to direct them and their issues 'for their own good'. But they aren't buying into it, as men know best what they need to be men, and women know best what it means to be women. I am unsure if feminism thought that they could really pull the wool over mens' eyes when they tell them to 'let feminists handle equality, men don't have to do anything unless its under the banner of feminism'. And yet men are awakening to the idea that their own issues of Custodial Inequality, Educational Inequality, and Crime Penalty inequalities, and job injury/stress inequalities, should be addressed. But they'll do it themselves, thank you, since feminism is not only not tackling ALL inequality, but shouts down male issues as irrelevant.  People are already distancing themselves rapidly from feminism. Most homeless people are men. When a rational member of the public understands the challenges men face and that there are little to NO places for homeless men or abused men, or male rape victims or male victims of domestic violence, they don't reach for feminism to fix the male homelessness problem. When mothers see their boys falling behind in school across the board, and see there are no male teachers anywhere in their school district who understands teaching boys, and they awaken to the dire plethora of overdiagnoses of ADHD in the 1980s and 1990s made by female teachers who couldn't handle boys' natural activity levels, they don't reach for feminism to get the school to do right by their sons.   Men are not evil and boys are not broken. But that's a view in textbooks, colleges, and tumblr. It is not spreading tendrils into all of society; even after college feminists get a rude wake up call as they enter the workplace where they must treat men equally and can't find a 'safe space room' with playdoh and pillows in it beside the employee break room, to go coddle themselves over some imagined offense. There's already a great divide between feminism and the rest of the population. Only real equality will move our society forward, and real equality requires all people to have a seat and a voice at the equality table, and autonomy over their own issues. This must include men, or people reject it's authenticity as equality."
videos,3dzlok,thetimeplace,28,Tue Jul 21 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"As a teacher I'd like to share something on your point regarding boys, ADHD and schools.  I was an ESL teacher in Asia, where they separate the boys and girls. I used to joke that I would rather teach three girls classes than one boys class.  I was talking with a girlfriend of mine, who was a strong feminist, about my experiences teaching. I told her that the girls were very good students: they arrived on time, sat down, were calm, and listened. The boys however were usually late, rowdy, and difficult to control. I said to her that I really think the boys would benefit greatly if they could get more exercise and were allowed more time to be aggressive and rowdy and all the things young boys like to do, of course. And that if boys were given more time to be boys, they might also be better students.  She screamed in anger, ""THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS!! BOYS SHOULD BE MADE TO SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!"" I mean she was boiling over in rage. I could see her shaking with anger.  I asked her why she felt this way. She said that if girls can sit down and be quiet, then boys should be forced to sit down and shut up just as well. I said, ""Well, don't you think there's a bit of a difference between the genders and how they grow and mature?"" Needless to say this was met with more outrage, more screaming, and more accusations of my intolerable bigotry and sexism. How dare I insinuate there is a difference between the genders? All this rage because I basically said, ""Girls are naturally calm and attentive students. Boys, not so much. Maybe if boys could get more exercise they would be better students like the girls.""  This is a great problem in education now. Girls make better students in the traditional education system, but young boys don't fare so well, obviously. And if they don't, drug 'em up."

My dad primarily worked in the elementary school system and he told me how he'd always get people breathing down his neck, saying he shouldn't be allowed to be alone with children cause he has a penis. Really hurt him sometimes."

Feminism is basically a ""betterment for women"" and the latest feminist made a push to shoe horn in ""and it's for men too"".  The problem is, the mainstream says feminism = equality for all, but it's like Christians saying ""Jesus loves homosexuals too"" when in reality, there's a deep, biblical resentment towards them and some, if not most Christians despise homosexuals because their bible tells them so.  Much like radical feminists teach each other to hate men."

videos,3e0ba5,capsulized,9,Tue Jul 21 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"I used to make the oddest videos like this with my friends back in high school; videos that were more random then constructive and just kind of filming for the sake of filming. Once we got our footage uploaded to our PC's (and at the time it was DV Caset and a USB cable), we got super excited for the editing process. We'd throw everything into a pirated copy of Premiere Pro and just edit the footage to make each other laugh. Playing around with editing effects, post processing and sound was sometimes more fun than the actual process of filming the shots.  My friends and I all eventually got better at filming and editing because of making so many of these odd video monstrosities, which lead to us starting to make more structured plot driven pieces of film. Because there was no YouTube at the time (2004), we ended up making multiple DVD compilations with custom menu screens and user interfaces. We'd hand them out to people and go to independent film competitions and get very mixed reactions. We also dabbled in early YouTube content creation, and submitted videos to sites like College Humour or Newgrounds. In the end, it was a reason for me and my friends to get together and just make stuff together.   Although I may not be in the film industry now, my profession (Front End Web Developer / Graphics Designer) incorporates some, and if not all of the skills I started building way back when I was making those random videos. I've picked up the odd video composition and editing job, done sound editing, and build user interfaces for a living. So I may not be incredibly proud of the mindless works of art I produced in my teenage years, I am however glad I was building those fundamental skillsets that allow me to be a creative professional today.  Having said all that, I feel your brother and his friends have a lot of bottled up artistic potential. They seem like born creatives; using creative tools at their disposal, and testing the waters of what they can achieve without hurting anyone in the process. I'd encourage them to keep creating, but get them to realize that the sooner they start making more accessible content, their avant-garde antics won't be taken seriously except by each other. This isn't to say they need to fall into some genre or paradigm, but what I'm trying to say is that every great creative first learns how to apply the appropriate rules of their art form before beautifully and intelligently breaking them.   Good luck to them!  Edit: Assuming OP really is related."

I'd be pissed off if anyone who was not part of the intended act ran up on stage. If someone decided to just run up on a play I was watching, everyone in the audience would just be like ""wtf."" But it's Kanye, he interrupted Taylor Swift during that awards ceremony once so he doesn't get to perform his music in public ever again.    And all-in-all Kanye handled it pretty well.

videos,3dxzss,brainwrinkled,33,Mon Jul 20 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"My favorite guest was George Clooney as Sparky.   Actor George Clooney provided the small role of the voice of Sparky, which is limited entirely to dog barks.[7] Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about ""The Spirit of Christmas"", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park. Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because ""we thought it was funny"", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, ""Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things"".[2] Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small."

Personally, as a Southerner, I don't like his points at all. I don't want the flag flying over courthouses. Sorry for the incoming wall of text but I'm passionate about the subject;  He mentions the crimes committed under the US flag, that argument doesn't make any sense to me because we DO remember the Presidents who supported and were complicit in the institution of slavery but we celebrate the one who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. No one pretends that our founding fathers didn't own slaves, that sucks, we learned that the hard way and ended slavery in the US. The Confederate flag died supporting slavery, if the Confederacy lived long enough to end slavery on their own terms maybe they could celebrate that too, but that's not the way it happened. So the ""well you did it too!"" doesn't work, the US fixed it, the Confederacy actively supported it to it's last breath.  On treason, yeah, the US revolted against the British. There have been revolutions since the dawn of time. It sucks that the Confederate's revolution is so tied to white supremacy, so stop romanticizing it. Don't be proud of standing up for yourself over something stupid.  So that's it, I mean, I do really like that he's encouraging people to own up to the reality of what the flag stands for, but ""you did it too"" is a weak argument."

In my opinion the whole situation is fine as is, I dont think the stars and bars should be in any government buildings because it doesnt represent our government. At the same time I think the people that think taking down a flag will end racism is just as dumb. Individuals are allowed to fly whatever they want, I could even fly a Nazi flag in my front yard if I wanted but were talking about government buildings here and I think thats what people forget."

I think it's fine for the individual to fly whatever they want, but the video opens with ""we'll get it back and they'll let us hang it on every courthouse"", which I don't agree with, because like you said, it shouldn't be in government buildings.  A small e: I don't think anyone believes taking it down will ""end racism"", taking it down is part of the message that the government doesn't condone it. A seemingly small and petty act is actually a pretty big deal to some, I imagine having to walk under that flag as a minority to enter a courthouse before conducting what's probably important business feels a little surreal and puts that feeling in the back of your mind that maybe your tax dollars don't mean that you're going to be treated fairly.

His point is 'We should fly this flag because it is our shame'.  Which is a billion miles away from the reason people actually want to fly the Confederate flag.  It's a nice bit of sophistry if you want trip up the person you're arguing with. But it's entirely disingenuous as a justification.
videos,3e20zk,Ihaveadeathray,0,Tue Jul 21 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"His point is more so that both flags (American and Confederate) have a history of racism and violence, so what makes one more disrespectful than the other? Flags themselves are useless symbols whose representations are entirely subjective, and both good and bad can come from any flag/ symbol in history depending on who you poll. This guy is pretty much saying ""Instead of worrying about the subjective meaning behind this flag, worry about why this flag is offensive to some, and fix that issue"". We need to focus less attention to something which represents something negative, and worry more about the actual negative behavior. The same goes with the positives of the flag. Those in favor of the flag should worry less about whether or not they should wave that meaningless flag around, and take the positive representations behind the flag and spread that to others verbally or through their own actions."

The flag represented the CSA for only 2 years yet this is the ""heritage"" the South wants to promote over so many heritage things the South can be proud of yet they choose this to represent them.  It doesnt make sense.  Pride over States Rights is not correct since the seceding Southern States clearly declared that some of the Northern States were not following the federal government's Fugitive Slave Act of 1793.  The South was complaining the Northern States were exercising States Rights over Federal.  It's hypocritical to use the Civil War South as exercising ""States Rights""."

videos,3dzwl1,thetelic,5,Tue Jul 21 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I very briefly played in a band with two ""Chris"" kinds of fellas when I was in high school.  I played a lot of live music along with a couple of other kids from my school.  Word gets around a lot better in that kind of environment since everyone knows each other and teens like to gossip.  So one day this kid Mark who I used to hang out with in middle school (we hated each other but we had the same friends) approached me and asked me to participate in the school talent show.  They wanted me to fill in for their bassist who split on them like two weeks before the event.  For some reason I agreed before I listened to them play.  I had only ever been in the one band and it didn't even occur to me that I should have checked them out before I played with them.  Why would anyone bother signing up to perform if they sucked?  I showed up at their drummer's house and realized that I had made a grave mistake.  I recognized the drummer from a Tae Kwon Do class I had taken when I was like eight.  I shit you not his name was Chris and he acted exactly like this.  He pretended to smoke cigarettes, talked about getting expelled from school, his room was painted purple and there was all kinds of stupid shit scribbled all over his wall with magic marker and bits of duct tape, and the first thing he did when I walked into his house was show me his fucking katanas and nunchucks.  They played the song they wanted me to learn and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Neither of them could play for shit.  They didn't even seem to be playing the same song.  Chris had a five piece First Act set and Mark had a shitty little 25 watt guitar amp.  They gave me the parts, we went over it a few times, I came back a week later, we practiced it again, and by the time the talent show rolled around I was so ashamed of myself for having agreed to do this that I turned my amp almost all the way down when we got on the stage because I simply didn't want to be a part of it.  It ruined my reputation as a musician for the remainder of high school.  Fortunately I was a senior and the talent show was half way through the school year.  Two acts later this kid and his dad and uncle came on and played an original country song.  I don't even particularly like country and it sounded fucking awesome.  It wasn't even because he was playing with experienced adults, the kid was doing all the singing and he was playing rhythm too.  No one even knew he played music.  So that didn't help my situation.  In retrospect, I should have seen this coming.  Mark played a cover of Every Rose Has its Thorns at a talent show in middle school and actually walked off stage half way through the song because he fucked up bad.  Cried backstage.  Our performance together wasn't much better, he forgot his own lyrics half way through the song and just finished up with some messy chords.  Had the nerve to turn around as we were leaving the stage and accuse me of messing up my parts.  I'm like nigga you couldn't even hear me.  So that's my ""Chris"" story."

videos,3dxi7n,trippy_grape,27,Mon Jul 20 16:40:34 2015 UTC,now that makes more sense why she picked her so fast. I'm guessing the other 2 judges are more rock/pop?
videos,3dxi7n,HImainland,47,Mon Jul 20 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. The younger guy is Dima Bilan. You might remember him from Eurovision some years ago (Link - holy hell it was almost ten years ago). He actually has some opera background.  The other guy is Maxim Fadeev, a singer in the nineties (bet you can tell by the music video), now a producer. Not a big star by any margin but still very respected in the Russian music circles.  The thing you need to know about this show - this in not the adult version of the Voice, but so called ""Voice Kids"". The upper age limit is 16,  and there is no lower limit. They literally have toddlers there. So when the judges hear a good voice they assume its a more adult person singing. You can see the disappointment in Bilan's eyes when he turns around and sees such a young girl.  And the overall tone of the show is different. I tried watching the American show and it was just too mean for my taste. The judges here may not pick every single person, but they are still very supportive afterwards.   If you want to see some more of the blind auditions, here's my favourite from this season. This kid was really good too. This girl ended up winning. I love how her younger sister backstage is blocking her ears and having none of it."
videos,3dxi7n,thatguyinconverse,11,Mon Jul 20 17:04:50 2015 UTC,I think it's an american thing. If you compare Masterchef Australia/Canada to Mastechef USA you'll find USA version really mean. Judges in Australian/Canadian version are so supportive even though dish is utter horrible. Where as in USA's version you would Joe throw the food in dustbin or something like that. I mean not a single chef or a person who respects food will throw away dish like that.

videos,3dxi7n,captaincannibal,101,Mon Jul 20 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I tend to avoid these type of shows as I have a hard time believing it's all about the talent, and the lack of cable in my house. Makes much more sense. My only problem is that if someone can sing opera they are equipped for pretty much any music training as opera takes such a huge range. At least that's what my theater arts director would tell us."
videos,3dxi7n,GerudoKingOfThieves,87,Mon Jul 20 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"It's a specific style and technique though. Many of the opera singers can't sing pop in a pleasant way, it ends up sounding forced and out of place. Singing teachers, even for contemporary music, often also have low opinions of breaking your voice or screaming and refuse to teach the correct techniques for those eventhough such exist."

I hate that they don't teach this. I sang opera when I was young, I had a range like this girl. My instructor refused to teach me how to ""break my voice"" without breaking my voice. Eventually, I did learn, but only just before I stopped caring and decided to take up smoking instead. :/ Bad life choices are bad..."
videos,3dxi7n,DevilishDreamer,7,Mon Jul 20 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's very unfortunate. I wish they'd embrace different styles of music more but knowing a lot of classical trained musicians has led me to believe that the training somewhat affects their creativity and ability to think outside the box in a negative way. That would at least prevent people from ruining their voice."
videos,3dxi7n,vanNostrandby,16,Mon Jul 20 18:46:30 2015 UTC,Your theatre arts director is wrong.  Ballet dancers aren't necessarily going to be good breakdancers either.
videos,3dxi7n,Tychonaut,12,Mon Jul 20 16:10:44 2015 UTC,I think highly trained ballet dancers probably have a far higher chance of being good breakdancers than the average person. Maybe even more than the average self-proclaimed breakdancer.
videos,3dxi7n,HuhDude,12,Mon Jul 20 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"I think highly trained ballet dancers probably have a far higher chance of being good breakdancers than the average person.   Well sure.  But you could reverse that and say ""highly trained breakdancers have a far higher chance of being good ballet dancers than the average person"".  Sure.. any kind of training is good.  But to look at opera singers as ""being equipped to sing any kind of style"" is not really right."

videos,3dxi7n,dasheea,177,Mon Jul 20 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"Agree.   What shocks me is that she says the aria of the first part would take her a long time to learn, so she's just going to do the fast part.  From layman's ears, the slow aria part sounds MUCH easier, but I guess from a pro's perspective, the standard of quality for the aria is just much higher while for the second part, you just have to belt out the correct pitch and get over with it."
videos,3dxi7n,duffman82991,84,Mon Jul 20 14:45:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a classical brass player, which shares a lot of common techniques with being a classical singer. Slow pieces are always some of the hardest to perform. There is a ton of pressure on the performer to make the piece musical. A lot of planning goes into where the highs and lows of the piece will be, where to build tension, how to phrase everything down to each specific note articulation. Its a challenge to make slow pieces not sound 'boring'.  On the technical side, small mistakes are much more obvious in slow pieces. You need to practice where to take every breath, so you don't run out of air at the wrong time, for example."

videos,3dxi7n,Zummy20,37,Mon Jul 20 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Always a favorite example of mine to show about how complex getting good dynamics and emotion through arias is this performance of bach on solo violin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GIi2z_puHs  Look at her bow during these long drawn out notes and see how quickly she varies the speed she pulls it, and on the upclose shots look how she varies the angle to control how much bow is hitting the string. Then you can hear how controlled the shaking of her left hand (vibrato) is. How a single note can go from a solid thick single tone to a wavering dance. It's very easy to overdo this to the point it sounds comical. Good vibrato is what sells most intermediate musicians and its still a contender for the advanced crowd as well.   Yes the notes are long and sustained, but there's so much that is still going on for the musician, it's a certain challenge that requires much more musicianship to execute on longer notes."

You are also more or less correct about belting out the correct notes because a lot of times you can get away with certain problems in faster music."
videos,3dxi7n,jayme0227,12,Mon Jul 20 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"I thought the implication was that she already knew the fast part at the end from doing it when she was younger. Learning the aria would take a while and that was more work than she wanted to put in, so she just did the part she knew."

Anyway, here's someone else just about nailing it, pretty impressive since the original was a digitally altered opera singer, who flat out said the song wasn't humanly possible.  I'm not sure how many Fifth Element know much about the aria, but it's ""Il dolce suono"" from Lucia di Lammermoor, the ""mad scene"".  Lucia goes mad and kills her bridegroom Arturo, and in the song imagines being with her love, Edgardo.  There's more back story to it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_di_Lammermoor#Act_3  Joan Sutherland singing Il Dolce Suono.  Pretty intense imho.  Maria Callas, audio only.  If you're impressed by someone singing the Diva Dance, give the aria from Queen Of The Night a listen.  I got the chance to hear this performed live.  Not the opera, just the opera.  When a talented soprano sings it, live, it's magical.  EDIT:  Mozart wrote this one specifically to humiliate a singer he didn't like.  He was a little shit, that one."

No legitimate sales position will ever require you to pay the company money in order to work for them. As soon as they talk about buying a membership or paying for a sales package, that's your cue to leave. When you're working, you're investing time that you could be spending doing other things. It doesn't make any sense that you would be required to pay that company money in order to work for them. I've been pitched by friends to join several pyramid schemes. Each one of them has required a ""buy in"". I could be wrong, but I don't think a pyramid scheme works without requiring a ""buy in"" or investment from the people they're trying to recruit."

This means they are allowed to not pay you a wage, all your money comes from commission. However, they take a portion of your sales, so any money you do make flows right up to upper management. It is possible to make no sales in a day, especially considering you're selling landscaping door to door.

I am russian living in Germany and one day I was looking for a job then I found a note on my dorm: ""looking for russian speaking employees"". I thought well than I'll give it a try. I phoned the guy and got an appointment. It turned out one of those pyramids. The company was called Amway. But I didn't know it yet.   I came to the appointment and there were two of them. A woman and guy. From the moment I've seen them I thought that I should not trust them. Then the show began! They started telling me about this wonderful company, about their products, how great is all of this stuff... I already knew that it was a scam right from the beginning but I really wanted to see how really fucked up it was. So I played a complete dumbass. For quite a while they showed me some of the products and advertised them as ""miracle"" and ""most advanced"" and ""tested for everything"". Then they showed me their steel wool sponge which apparently has been in a jar for 7 months and didn't corrode. Then some washing powder that completely dissolves in water (which of them doesn't?). Then they wanted me to try their vitamins which I didn't want. I didn't want to die that young.   I listened all that shit then they showed me a copies (pretty old and crappy ones) of some presentation where they explained how that ""system"" worked. They said it is okay to bring all of your family in that misery. Then the paychecks appeared. The woman apparently earned so much money that she could live from that for several months. Yeah. Yeah. Okay then I converted from a dumbass to a guy how I really am... Who questions every single claim made by anyone.   I asked them questions for every single claim... Then all of their enthusiasm suddenly stopped. None of them were answered. Their best argument: showing at the ""dissolved"" washing powder ""you've seen it yourself? How can that lie?""  Then I went to confrontation. I mean full on! I spend my time on a bullshit like this. I had to drive like 30 miles there and it is not like petrol is cheap here.

videos,3e0y7u,Darnis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:40 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of very specific branches of Christianity, which is why I said that aren't associated with cults. What you're talking about sounds like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons.  I was raised a Catholic (I'm not anymore), so I only know from the Catholic church exactly, but:   There is no emphasis on recruiting. There was no one who encouraged going door to door. Again, you're thinking of Jehovah's Witnesses There is no ""ladder"" to move up in. There are no ""rankings"" in the Catholic ChurchYou're either a member, or you're not. If you're talking about Priests, Nuns, Bishops, Cardinals, and Popes, then yes there is a ladder, but that is not paid for through money. That's stuff you dedicate your life for. When you're a Priest, you are a 100% full time priest. Even though I don't follow Christianity anymore, everyone knows that science hasn't disproved religion yet. There is no evidence for the non-existence of a god. Yes, science has proven that things like creation, the flood, and the age of the Earth are wrong from a biblical point of view, but you can't say that science has disproved religion as a whole. Catholics follow the New Testament, which has none of those rules. They mostly follow everything that was taught by Jesus (turn the other cheek, love thy neighbour, eye for an eye makes us a blind)   Again, I'm not a religious person, but it's the farthest thing from a ""Pyramid Scheme"".  If they demanded you pay money to be a member, like Scientology, then it would be a pyramid scheme. But the church runs solely on donations, which were never forced to be given."

While it's super messed up the way this lady acted, the fact that her son and the guy who posted the video (who looked like they were probably within 10-20 years apart in age) were able to have a calm, collected dialogue without throwing racist vitriol at each other speaks a lot of subsequent generations after this lady's time. I know a default subreddit probably isn't the type of place to have this type of opinion, but I do believe racism exists: to some extent, in both directions.  And this isn't to say it's only in the older generations, it exists in 10-20 year olds too. But I think it's good to recognize that we're at least...progressing away from some of our racist tendencies from generation to generation. I'm sure being 63 and from Georgia this lady has seen white people do some fucked up things, and I feel really sorry for her, but I'm sure everyone here would agree that her opinions on race are part of what's hurting race relations. There's a lot of other shit that's hurting them, but it's part of it anyway.

The fact is, the noise they are making is not coming from them doing anything out of the ordinary. The insulation is just shit. How can you get angry at that when there is no malice or non-consideration? I hear their young son toddling about. I hear her cleaning. I hear their washing machine. I hear her boyfriend fucking her with the power of a Panzer tank twice a week, and when he walks to the bathroom to wipe his dick afterwards. What can I do about it? 'Oh hey stop doing all the things any normal person would do because our building is shit and your flat has wooden floors'?  Gotta roll with the punches sometimes, and this idiot needs to accept that. Bitch is a fucking narcissist with matriarch syndrome and needs pretty much everyone in her life to tell her to shut her stupid mouth."

I would play my guitar to the same rhythm as the folks getting it on when they knew I was home too.  I jammed along to their drum beat of love.  When they paused, I paused too, or maybe just sustained a note, adding a little reverb for anticipation.  It was basically to say:  ""Yes.  I am a part of this now""  edit - They were terrible people; beyond inconsiderate.  He was a doctor, she was a social worker and they both were awful people.  It was baffling.  Asked me to take care of their new Chihuahua one time.  Said ""Can you watch Sam on Thursday?""  They didn't come back until Tuesday!  Ruined my weekend plans because I had to care for their dog.  They would keep him in their locked room every weekend after that.  It would toss it's food around and shit itself all over in it's pen.  It was not well-adjusted.  Then there was the time his old roommates had demanded he take back the cat he left behind.  Told neither me or the other guy living with us.  We both just start hearing painful meowing from their private bathroom.  They put the cat in a carrying case on top of the toilet.  How do I know this?  Because it fucking came crashing down one day I was home.  I broke the door down and was horrified at the condition of the cat, dying, manged fur, caked with shit and puke and piss.  No sign of food or drink.  I had to assume he was starving it to death out of frugal cowardice of not taking it to a vet to be properly put down.  I let the cat out, bought a litter box, bought him food and let him explore and find a place comfortable in the common area.  He was still alive when I left a few months later.

There were at least 11 of them in a two bedroom apt.  They had a 6 yr old boy that would jump and play so loud it would knock pictures off my wall. I politely approached them a few times and asked if they would please calm him down. They were extremely nice but always say they don't know how to control him.   So one day I asked the mother if she would go along with me if I tried to scare him into behaving. She agreed.  I put on my uniform and came back upstairs pounding on the door. She made him answer. I proceeded to drill instructor style instruct him to listen to his parents. He was shaking and crying (all I did was the voice loudly and point as I talked) I never heard him again for the rest of the year I lived there. She even thanked me and said she would tell him she would call me when he was misbehaving as a threat. Every time one of them saw me in the hall or around the apartment they laughed and would tell me how much it changed the boy's behavior.  He would peek out of the windows when I would leave and come home from work and I would make the ""look at me I'm the parent now"" motion."

I had called the office a few times about the noise from my downstairs neighbor. Music blaring at midnight. Then her yelling racist rants through the ceiling at me. One time she came upstairs on a Sunday afternoon while I had people over and proceeded to threaten me, verballly assaulted my character and berated me. She is black and was yelling white racist insults at me and calling me gay (im straight) and she threatened my life twice saying she was going to get a gun and blow my brains out (which is illegal in the state of Florida - criminal threat leg.state.fl.us/Statutes… ). She then realized I had a mixed crowd of races in my house and said we all must be gay together. She said her complaint was she could hear me walking around and I had been stomping. I walk around here barefoot or in socks 90% of the time and in now way stomp. I weigh 185 lbs and am not a huge guy.  Not only did I have people over who witnessed this but we captured the last 12 minutes of it on video. The video captures almost all of the above except for the first 5 minutes of a racist tirade. In the video they are even shown trying to force the door open as im trying to close and lock it.   I took this video to the office and asked that she be evicted or I be allowed to be released from my lease with no penalties or fees. They said legal was taking care of it but could not go into details with me about it. Well here it is 5 weeks later and guess who I happen to run into yesterday. The same neighbor. I don't think for the money I pay I should be forced to live above someone who has threatened my life twice and I have it on tape.

The rate of descent of the hand is also suspect, as we all know falling objects fall at a rate of roughly 9.8m/s, where as this hand is falling (eyeballing it here) at roughly 7.2m/s, showing that the owner of the hand is exerting some force upwards, and preventing it from falling naturally.

I was never legally an American citizen so when I turned 16, I was not able to own a car. I managed to get accepted in University as an international student where, after about 8 years of education, I was able to earn a Doctorate in Atheism and started dating a super cute gamer girl that I met in my Intro to Philosophy class. We went together for 4 years while I was working toward my PhD. It was after graduation when truly felt what it was to be an American. After all, isn't that what living in the Land of the Free is all about? Getting a STEM education to earn lots of money and marrying a cute white girl to support with that salary? Even after all this, living in America for this long and getting a superior STEM education, I applied for American citizenship about 2 years ago but, unfortunately I was rejected. This saddened me, but I had something else amazing going for me. The night after my graduation, I took my beautiful, white, atheist, gamer girlfriend to the Hayden Planetarium where we watched a laser show featuring Queen's greatest hits. We even got to meet Neil DeGrasse Tyson himself! In the middle of Bohemia Raphsody I popped the question. She said yes and immediately went down on me for 45 minutes right until the end We Are The Champions. We got married that summer and even had my Professor of Science from University officiate the marriage with Science Readings from Carl Sagan's Cosmos. After the wedding, we had our reception at the local dive bar where we shared microbrews and had projector run the entire season of Firefly. It was beautiful. The next day, I immediately I went to the Ferrari dealership with my 6 figure Atheism salary, and slammed down $260,000 cash on the salesman's desk. ""I'll take that one"" - I pointed to the, then brand new, 458 Spider in classic rosso corsa. ""Right away sir!"" he said as him and 3 of his assistance rushed to get the paper work for me. One wheeled in a lazy boy and handed me a glass of scotch while I waited. After, I went down to the DMV to register that shit. The clerk rushed me to the front of the line so that I didn't have to wait. They saw that I clearly had money so they knew I would tip well (I didn't. I don't believe in tipping on principle). After registering my new sports car, I drove to Staples, bought a computer, called up Comcast and got some fiber-op internet, downloaded Chrome (lol fuck IE), went to reddit.com and registered an account just to say this."

Another way to look at it is, if humans never happened as a species.

Religion gives you its version of truths in spite of good evidence that may contradict it and without explaining which events literally happened and which are metaphorical.

That said, I will offer my view;  I was at one point very devote, and still believe a lot of the moral teachings present in the latter parts of the new testament are applicable today, but, as time goes on, the nature of what governs our lives and people's decisions becomes clearer, and the christian bible looks more and more like it was made to apply to a period in time when it was required; it is becoming antiquated as our societies adopt better and more reasonable morals and standards, for the most part, to accommodate our growing understanding of the nature of things.  When I look at these kinds of videos, I reflect on my own understanding of things in general, and am reminded that it is often subject to personal flaws in reasoning, comprehension, and repeated translation/author interpretation, which may taint my initial view. When I discover flawed reasoning, I have always found it in my, and everyone's, best interest to admit to that error. What little evidence we do have is enough to make what is known as solid as we can make it, but that understanding is still subject to change. I remain skeptical to first opinions, not out of spite, but as a precaution, to ensure I have time to understand what I have learned of as clearly as I can, and time to review what I already know, or thought I knew. Discovering the truth of the matter can at times take some reading between the lines. When I don't understand something, or it doesn't appear to make sense, I actually commit some time to doing research on my own; it's how I learned the bible; only the blind follow without question, and on that note, I am generally not afraid of asking questions when I don't understand something.  Beyond that, it is wonderfully informative, and every time I view them the only thing I dread is the comments sections; It is of my deepest desires that people would abandon their ""I'm right, you're wrong"" and ""you don't know? well, you are just so far beneath me then, idiot"" mentalities, get over themselves, and actually contribute something to progress for once.

Written by Jews who already lived there, it was aimed at those already being brought up there, who would have related much easier to the seven day week used by Babylonians than whatever the old Jewish System was.

Some of the best evidence we have for the big bang comes from the ""cosmic microwave background"".  If you watch the video again, Neil mentions that the early universe had a toooon of photons in it, many more photons than ordinary matter.  He also mentioned that at some point, when the universe cooled down enough (to about 3000 degrees), the universe became transparent and photons were free to travel around. One useful prediction from this fact is that the universe should still be absolutely bathed in photons that were once about 3000 degrees.  So, if scientists could found this massive amount of old photons, it would be a huge piece of evidence for the big bang theory.  Astronomers predicted that the universe has expanded by about a factor of 1000 since all of the photons were released, so all these photons that were once 3000 degrees are now predicted to only be about 3 degrees. Well, through years of scientific studies it turns out that the universe is just completely full of photons that are about 3 degrees.  There is no other proposed theory for why this would occur, so it is pretty well accepted that the universe was once scrunched up in a very small space about 14 billion years ago. As for what happened even before all the photons were released, when NDT was talking about the unification of all the forces (gravity, strong, weak, electromagnetic), scientists are not 100% sure on that.  It makes sense to them, but there is not enough data to draw a conclusion, or even close to a working theory on how the forces would be unified at a high temperature."

videos,3dyi3h,zjbird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"At high temperatures there is enough energy for photons to collide and create matter and anti-matter, so knowing that the temperature is high will tell you there is a certain balance of energy as light vs as matter. Since the reaction can also go the other way with matter + antimatter becoming light, there's a balance between the two just from thermodynamics. The size of the universe is deduced from the size of large-scale variations in the density of matter, that used to be much much much smaller. It used to be so small that the variations in density were solely due to the uncertainty principle (which says that position and motion of small things cannot be exactly zero and follow a random distribution) and these variations caused some patches of the universe to expand more rapidly than others. The theory is called inflation and it's been very strongly confirmed by measuring the density of distant patches in the sky."

For more information, Google Pre-Biotic Earth, you might find awesome theories.  I cant even theorize for myself because I would need to be a scientist in exobiology to understand some of the processes involved.  All we know is Earth was shitty, then carbon atoms formed underwater to create life, life happened for a long time, eating the stuff that made the oceans so dirty. The oceans cleaned up, and then the air was more breathable above the water, so vegetation spread out to clean up the CO2 created by the ocean.  As life fed, the oceans got too clean, so life began to eat one another.  Survival of the fittest happened."

videos,3e2h8s,gpia7r,12,Tue Jul 21 16:59:43 2015 UTC,Planned parenthood performs or supplies resources in helping young women receive abortions.  There are many areas/domains that can use these tissues to potentially save lives.  I'm really trying to find a reason to pickup a pitchfork.  That woman said at least twice the organization wasn't in it for the money.    The fetus isn't a human being yet.  They said the fetus tissue would come from the first trimester.  The main issue for me would be transparency.  Like if Planned Parenthood attempted to hide the fact from the donor.
videos,3e2h8s,coincrazyy,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:39 2015 UTC,Planned Parenthood actually does much more than provide abortion services. Their primary services focus on the prevention of unintended pregnancies.  Though abortion is likely the hottest topic relative to what they do it is but one slice of a spectrum of services they provide. In one of the threads from the last video about this issue a gentleman explained that he went to Planned Parenthood for a vasectomy which obviously falls under the prevention of unintended pregnancies. Here's what their own site explains: http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance
videos,3e2h8s,Creativation,4,Tue Jul 21 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"And at $75-$100 a go, we're talking about a tiny amount of money changing hands on their low volume.   800 abortions a year, but only X percentage can be used depending on the trimester and extraction method, 30-40% of people say no to donating (according to the woman in the video) and whatever other misc. conditions.  So I'd guess anywhere from 10,000 USD - 60,000 USD a year. That's peanuts for an organisation this big.  With the amount of paperwork and oversight involved, the cost of preserving and packaging specimens and all the associated hassle, I can't see how they'd be making a profit on it.  If the patient agrees to give it away and planned parenthood are just covering their costs involved, I don't see what the problem is. I assume that the tissue is being used to save/help other people or for important medical science?"

Mary Gatter the PP executive doesn't even know what the fees would be to cover their own expenses. The ""Lamborgini"" comment is just off the cuff joking.

I would agree with what you've written if the context supported it but it does not. As I wrote above, if there is some unethical/illegal activities going on at Planned Parenthood then let those be addressed. What we have here in this video is not rising to that level."
videos,3e2h8s,Creativation,3,Tue Jul 21 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"i think the fact that there is a negotiation of any type going on... is in itself part of the problem..  they should state in their policies of their foundation, that they request a donation of 100$ or whatever it is per specimen from established groups heirin..  they dont do that.."
videos,3e2h8s,ThatIsJustOK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:02 2015 UTC,That strikes me as a valid concern and I am inclined to agree that it would be a good idea to remove discussions on prices from how they operate. I would also tend to agree that it is questionable discussing how procurement is to be performed (i.e. preserving structures vs. not preserving structures). Just establishing fixed prices and fixed tissue procurement procedures and making those known publicly sounds sensible.  The only reason I can imagine that prices are not set is because each affiliate is operating independently and has its own expense levels that need to be met.

videos,3dyyt3,SyntheticGod8,5,Mon Jul 20 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"What's difficult to deal with a lot of online behavior that goes bad is how thin the line can be for someone to reasonably feel like they didn't play a part in it. In these instances described in the video, many people would probably think that the line is not that thin, but this behavior isn't limited to being outright vitriolic and targeting people.   It's back to that saying where no raindrop feels responsible for the flood. Do we look at each behavior and question if it is a raindrop? We each have a responsibility not to be the raindrop and not contribute to the flood right? We can't just exculpate ourselves by saying we only contributed a small part in it.   It seems most reasonable that you shouldn't be responsible for others' behaviors, if you speculate on something and someone else takes that and runs with it, it seems reasonable that you shouldn't be responsible for their behavior. So would behavior like that be a raindrop? Even just simple overreactions, which if you look at the example provided in the video with the woman who made the aids joke, if you overreact to this event, were you a raindrop that contributed to the flood? Even if you didn't make death threats or demand she be fired, but had simply tweeted ""Wow that is an outrageously insensitive tweet"", is that contributing to the flood?  To me that is just where it becomes so difficult to convince people that their behavior in these mobs is bad. It's so hard to convince people that they are playing a role in it, and in some cases, it's hard to tell if they actually are playing a role in it or not. What is sometimes a harmless behavior, can also be a harmful behavior. Most of the time we're all relatively ignored, what we say isn't always being acknowledged or seen by thousands/millions of people, and so it has no effect, but then in those rare instances it can be seen by so many people that it has an effect we didn't even intend. It can be the exact same behavior and most of the time it has no consequences, and then on rare occasion it does, and the reasons for why it happens like that are out of our control so there isn't a sense of responsibility involved in it."

And it can be for such trivial things - it made national news the other day that Ryan Reynolds used a baby carrier wrong.  I've seen friends on facebook share and like stories that they don't know the truth about and when I question them about it and highlight the effect that it could have, they claim innocence from their actions where they just felt they shared something they disagreed with or there was some sort of social injustice.

videos,3dyyt3,jamesneysmith,9,Tue Jul 21 01:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a thing that's happening all over right now. I actually stopped playing Magic the Gathering (an otherwise well designed and entertaining competitive card game) and decided not to purchase any more magic or D&D products (which I was spending way too much on to begin with) from Wizards of the Coast because of their participation in a similar twitter catharses. If you missed it on reddit it's because it slowly blew up on /r/magictcg for a couple days right before Victoriagate when the mods took the subreddit private for a bit and then censored discussion on the topic.  The gist of what happened was that a player with an old criminal history was starting to do well in the game (placing in some of the top spots of tournaments, getting their matches featured on tournament streams, etc.) and then another player with an axe to grind started bringing up the first player's history publicly in various ways to drum up internet pitchforks. This culminated in broadcasting the player's background again while their match was being streamed for maximum attention and produced an eerily similar result to the video above with the difference being that the player targeted by the flaming wasn't even involved in the ignition of it. So the thing got kind of big and even some of the top pros (who I used to enjoy watching) jumped on board and joined the cries to ban the player from the game. Shortly afterwards the targeted player was banned from magic and lost their mtgo account (players tend to have a bit of money invested in those. Imagine losing your main steam account with all the games you've ever paid for there). The player that was actively harassing, and instigated a witch hunt against another player received no similar loss (that I'm aware of anyway, the news has been pretty suppressed), and the pros who joined the vitriol party are still having their media content hosted on top community websites. Business as usual for the mob participants. You can do whatever you want on social media as long as you have enough people to scream in chorus with you.  The annoying part for me was that many of the people fueling the flames were associated with my go-to sources of card sales/purchases like Starcitygames and Channel Fireball so I didn't want to move my collection through them. Sold most of my good stuff to locals at a bit under tcg-low."

It would be one thing for people to tell Justine her joke was in bad taste, if that's how you felt. It is another to infer that Justine is a bad person because she made a joke you thought is bad. If you want to criticize, take care to ensure you criticize the idea (the joke in this case) and not the person. Not only is this more just, but it's also more effective. Calling someone a racist is incredibly hard to prove, even if someone is racist, but telling someone they said a racist thing is incredibly easy to have a conversation about (given that all the knowledge of what was said can be known by all parties, whereas with an accusation of a person being racist, you can never know their thoughts so it is impossible to have a full picture) and doesn't require a lynching to get the point across. Also, and perhaps more importantly, when you criticize an idea and end up being wrong, all you've done is made another shitty idea for people to criticize. If you end up being wrong after attacking a person, instead of an idea, then you've just made yourself a bad person."

videos,3dyyt3,revolver_1,0,Tue Jul 21 07:22:21 2015 UTC,I'm okay with being voiceless. It's not like I have much to say anyway. :/
videos,3dyyt3,a1579,3,Mon Jul 20 22:08:27 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if you are being sarcastic or not, but I sincerely hope so.   The problem with that attitude of ""well, I don't have anything to say, I don't need a voice""(As well as, ""Well, I don't have anything to hide, I don't need privacy"") is that that when a decent number of people decide they don't need a voice, they become open to oppression by the people who want to use that voice. These oppressors gain power by exploiting the fact that that this demographic has remained voiceless, and can go about doing whatever they want to do. When the time finally comes that you want to say something, society is so far powerless against various governments and cultures of power that they have no way to speak out because they surrendered their only way of defending themselves.   Similarly, when people surrender their freedom of privacy, they set a precedent for a government or ruling power that it is okay to be intrusive. This behavior of ""This doesn't affect me, why should I care?"" Means that somewhere down the line, a ruling power will ultimately cross into a threshold which affects you, and then, you are powerless to stop tyranny.  A quote by Martin Niemöller comes to mind that sums up powerlessness and voicelessness quite well:    ""First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists,  and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews,  and I did not speak out—  Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.""   Conversely, having a voice does not mean that you should parade on twitter and facebook and other social media calling out people with privilege just because you can. With a voice comes responsibility, and useless shaming is not a responsible act.  Note: I apologize if this is badly written, but please try to understand the message(Isn't that the whole point of the video in the first place: That shaming for stupid reasons is ruining society?)"

They can go through your history and hang on to old comments or messages for weeks or months and then bring them up out of context later.   Essentially if you ever change your opinion about something, or take a stance on something that contradicts with how you feel about something else, people get to just dismiss whatever you say and call you a hypocrite.  In real life, you don't carry around every thing you have ever said or done constantly in the back of your head, but we act like that is somehow the case on the internet."

videos,3dyyt3,UmarAlKhattab,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of comments in here and in the talk discuss the idea that some people prioritise their appearance and the perception of themselves in terms of what they find ""offensive"" and ""morale"" over actually caring about other people. Meaning that they blow things way out of proportion, all approving each other and patting each others backs in a feel good fuck-fest of fake morale superiority.  Pretty much everyone is guilty of this at one point or another. We've all acted too quickly or wrongly once or twice so that we can appear caring and just. The difference between people who do this and SJW's are that for a social justice warrior, it's full time.  I read a few subreddits like TIA etc, which are usually actually very light hearted (regardless of what some users might say about them). Reading these means that in my day to day life I see the things that these people see. I see something and understand how someone could interpret it as a micro-aggression, as sexist, as racist. However all you have to do is actually think about it objectively, instead of trying to make the crime fit, and you see that it's just something happening, and not a result of prejudice.  It's only since I started looking at these hilarious cases of ""social justice"" that I've noticed these small things. It would be very easy to get drawn into the idea that ""my eyes are now open"" as simply put, subscribing to the idea that you know more than  other people is very tempting. If you're looking for these small things to be offended about, you will find them. If you're capable and willing to look at them objectively, you can see that they aren't really there. By that I mean that all the little things I now pick up on as a result of seeing so many SJW issues, I only see because I've read about them. Logic dismisses them just as quickly."

videos,3dzj3o,IISpazticII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, the Dub looks like it might be AWD, and if it has a slush box it's really only a matter of mashing the go fast peddle and holding on. The 458 is going to have all kinds of fancy launch controls and shit, but if you turn all that off I would think it might actually be harder to launch than an AWD high powered car due to the 458 only getting power at the rear wheels.  Also, if a car can pass safety inspection, and in some places emissions regulations, I don't see why it wouldn't be legal in most countries. Movies and TV shows like to get all hot and bothered about street racers running ""illigal mods"" but honestly most of the craziest stuff you see is totally legal in most places. Sure you can't usually run straight pipes and racing slicks on a public road, but so long as a car has working lights, a windshield, DOT approved tires, has seat belts, and isn't ungodly loud it's probably going to be acceptable in most places."

Yes they are fast but you can put together a faster car for 1/5 of the price,  my Subaru STi puts down more power to the wheels (450 AWHP,  400 AWTQ) than a stock 458 Italia (420 RWHP,  320 RWTQ),  weighs about the same and has all wheel drive.   Ultimately this means that my car would slay a stock or lightly modified 458 in similar fashion and for about $2K I can bolt on a bigger turbo and make 600 to the wheels since my motor is reinforced and rebuilt with forged internals.   I guess I won't attract any underwear models in my Subaru but I'd much rather put the $200K that I saved into down payments on rental property or my startup.   ITT : Ferrari owners..."

There's Latino's in the main character's posse, there's Black guys who both help and hinder the main character, just like the White guys. The only main basis seems to be that most women in the film portray positive roles (judge, social worker, wife, kid).   In fact, it becomes super clear early on that the main baddie is the main character's anger. And until they get that under control, they'll never win anything."

videos,3dxb17,mastersw999,58,Mon Jul 20 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"Live sound tech here.  Stevie either has a monitor in front of him or in ear systems where that mic is turned up very loud (louder than every thing else around him). So if some one were to walk into the mic, he would hear it, he would also hear the sound of the stand falling over through the mic. And since he is not the only one singing he could have gauged the direction the mic was falling via who started to sound louder in that mix."
videos,3dxb17,OiMcCoy,20,Tue Jul 21 00:15:43 2015 UTC,...or just the fact that he's not totally blind.  He can still see somewhat.
videos,3dxb17,FlightChops,10,Mon Jul 20 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"Well most legally blind people can still see some things. I am no expert as to his vision, so I am not making a judgment on that. What I do know is live sound. I could have made the same catch as him with my eyes closed. And I possess far less experience of being on stage than him. So I am just aiming to provide a rather logical explanation as to how he could make an educated guess as to where the mic stand was going to fall."

At most he would hear that someone bumped into it but he would have no way of knowing which way it was gonna fall. Plus he looks at the stand when he catches it."
videos,3dxb17,mydearwatson616,5,Tue Jul 21 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"It's also not the only mic on stage, and wouldn't explain him knowing where it is and how its falling."
videos,3dxb17,IlleFacitFinem,4,Mon Jul 20 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"Plus he looks at the stand when he catches it.   He has sunglasses on.  You can't possibly know where he is looking at, if he is looking at anything at all.  Just because he slightly turns his head in that direction doesn't mean he is looking at it.   Another live sound tech here. With all that sound around him, there's no way he's going to hear the falling of the mic stand in his monitor.   We're talking about a blind guy who's entire life is based around sounds and music.  Wouldn't it be more reasonable to think he might be able to pick up on audio clues better than expected, than to think he has been faking his blindness for decades?  I mean if the dude has been a huge public figure with cameras on him for a while, you would think he would have had more ""slip ups"" by now."
videos,3dxb17,caedicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:19 2015 UTC,I just think it's more likely that he can see a little bit than that he heard the directional fall of a mic stand during a song.

videos,3dxb17,boostedty4,25,Mon Jul 20 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Stevie also knew that Paul was coming from the right. He calculated that the mic stand probably would fall to his left. Back and to the left.

videos,3dzpzs,Jagos,10,Mon Jul 20 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"""Since most of the preferred 'domestic traits' are neotenous or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.[citation needed] It may also ""stimulate"" the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human stretching. Kneading is often a precursor to sleeping. Many cats purr while kneading. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.""

videos,3dzpzs,TheGreenManLives,3,Tue Jul 21 00:51:32 2015 UTC,i would also add that the cat is likely purring and probably breathing into the dogs ear. That kind rhythmic stimulation can be pretty relaxing. (For the dog)

And if you look at the cat's mouth, it searches through the dog's fur for a nipple.    I had a cat that did this because it was separated from its mother at too young an age and was never weened.  So she would get in your lap and try to nurse your chin.  Cute, but those claws hurt your neck!"
