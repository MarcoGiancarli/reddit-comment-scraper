This Eastern Orthodoxy/Radical Islamic alliance is only really spoken of AFAIK by some of the extremist Russian Orthodox individuals like Putin's advisor Aleksandr Dugin. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin  He also gets some of the information about Islam wrong, but then again, ISIS doesn't follow many of the traditional interpretations of Islamic rules either, so I dunno. His knowledge about the operations ISIS is conducting is way off though, so I kinda doubt he is affiliated with them."
omegle,3bztc8,kerkerker100,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Aleksandr Dugin:       Alexandr Gelyevich Dugin (Russian: Алекса́ндр Ге́льевич Ду́гин; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian political scientist known for his fascist views  and who calls to hasten the ""end of times"" with all out war.      He has close ties with the Kremlin and the Russian military,   having served as an advisor to State Duma speaker and key member of the ruling United Russia party Sergei Naryshkin.   Dugin was the leading organizer of the National Bolshevik Party, National Bolshevik Front, and Eurasia Party. He is the author of more than 30 books, among them Foundations of Geopolitics and The Fourth Political Theory.  He focuses on the restoration of the Russian Empire through the unification of Russian-speaking territories, which roughly corresponds to the former Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Ukraine, and unification with Russian-speaking territories, especially eastern Ukraine and Crimea.   In the Kremlin, Dugin represents the ""war party"", a division in the heart of the leadership concerning Ukraine,  and is seen as the driving conceptual force behind Vladimir Putin’s initiative for the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.  According to his geopolitical views, he considers the war between Russia and Ukraine to be inevitable and appeals for Putin to start military intervention in eastern Ukraine.

omegle,37emp1,irbinator,1 point,Wed May 27 01:54:17 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea either.  People can say ""Emily here"" in regular conversation.  Besides, if you ban a bot from using a specific keyphrase, it can always come up with something else.    Another thing Omegle could do is that if you, a specific user, gets disconnected from enough people you'd have to enter a CAPTCHA in order to further connect with people.  It could be annoying to an average user to have to do this in case people keep disconnecting with them, but it definitely beats having bots rampaging Omegle."
omegle,37emp1,baluchithyrium,0,Wed May 27 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know; I've been slung with those CAPTCHA's before and they're a real pain in the neck. I think the keyword-dictionary is still the best approach, and it could be pruned after a week or something to not make it too draconian.   For instance, ban the keyword or phrase ""TastyEmily"" or ""hi <newline> Emily here..."" because it's pretty assured that nobody says those. Then, after 7 days, the filter goes away and by then Emily probably will be gone.  I think having the dictionary be community regulated would also be easy; User hits a button, then selects the line with the catchphrase. If enough users do this, it's added to the dictionary (which is hard-whitelisted for stuff like m, f, hi, etc.)  I wish I could team up with the Omegle guys to figure something out."

There are only three types of people on Omegle: trolls; pervy, middle-aged Indian guys; and lonely/bored/depressed people.  Trolls won't start a conversation by saying ""Hi"".  Pervs will only start a conversation with ""asl"".  And lonely/bored/depressed people don't want to be reminded that their life has essentially boiled down to having small-talk on an anonymous chatting website. Because all that does is remind them of how lonely, or boring, or depressing and empty their friendless life is.  Everybody using Omegle wants something exciting to happen. Trolls want to laugh. Pervs want to get off. And everyone else wants to have a compelling conversation with somebody unconventional.  Nobody. NOBODY wants to talk about how their day went."

""Hello"" only entered the English language to let people know that you were on the other end of a telephone line. If you're on Omegle, then PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW YOU'RE THERE.  Just launch into conversation. ""Oh man, did I have a crazy day!"" or ""I just heard the most amazing song."" or ""Have you seen that YouTube video where blah blah blah happens?"" or WHATEVER. That gives the other person an easy in. By asking, ""How's it going?"" All you're doing is putting the onus on the other person to come up with a conversation.  And the fact of the matter is that's lazy. Most of the people you run into are going to be lazy speakers. That's why they don't have friends. Because they're bad at asking the right questions or too lazy to bother with it.  If you want to have an interesting chat, it's up to you to make it interesting. Know what you want to talk about and just start talking about it. Don't wait for the stranger on the other end to make things interesting for you."
omegle,34r830,DefinitelyNotACarrot,1 point,Mon May 4 01:13:12 2015 UTC,People saying hi on Omegle let's me know they're probably not a bot..
omegle,34r830,skimbosh,1 point,Mon May 4 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty bad criteria for determining if somebody's a bot or not, considering that's one of the MOST obvious ways to program a chatbot to start a conversation.  Of course, on Omegle, if they don't immediately say ""19/f/usa"" or ""u should check out my kik"" then they're probably not a bot anyway.  Truth is, the more unique the phrase, the more likely they are to be human, so you're still WAY better off staying away from common greetings and conversation-starters like ""Sup?"" or ""What's new?""  The only way somebody can respond to ""Hi"" is with ""Hi"", so it's just verbal garbage. If you're actually interested in having a conversation, then just start the conversation."

It's an attempt to keep robots from spamming the chats I'm pretty sure, so either just take it easy on the 'esc' key or try to talk to people instead of just exiting out of chats as soon as you're on there."

Sorry but that's about all I can suggest other than going to an incognito tab, but if you have a lot of 'topics' or something then you'll have to manually type them back in instead of copying and pasting.

Now wait. 5 minutes will usually do it. Plug it back in. Ta-da, you have changed your external IP and can now go on any sites you've been banned from.

omegle,33rjip,runningkrypt0,2,Tue Apr 28 15:59:26 2015 UTC,can you tell me how exactly it works and why 5 minutes?
omegle,33rjip,runningkrypt0,2,Sat Apr 25 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"Sure: Your connection to the internet is through your ISP (Internet Service Provider) Whenever you connect your modem to the internet they give you an IP. If you disconnect it they will start sending messages asking if you are still there. If you connect while they send them they give you back the old IP. If you wait for them to stop and connect, they give you a new one. So since Omegle blocks by IP (most websites do) they can't block you if you have a different IP. Why 5 minutes, its long enough most ISPs will time out. Some won't. Also this method won't work if you pay extra for a static IP. Which is where your ISP always gives you the same IP. (Useful if you host a server, otherwise it doesn't matter normally)"

I'm very suspicious about the whole moderator thing because as far as I know, I got banned for using profane terms which omegle identifies automatically. It has got nothing to do with active human moderation.   I smell something fishy here.

I digress, be sure to mention ""captcha"" ""recaptcha"" ""captchas"" and ""recaptchas"" in your feedback and in my experience, the captchas will be lifted either immediately or in a few hours. My suspicion is that one of those four words automatically get them to lift the captchas but I haven't been able to test that properly yet. I suppose you could mention about connectivity issues in the feedback post as well, as maybe that'll automatically trigger their feedback bot to lift that limit on your IP that they've placed.  I've reached out to them several times to comment on how their captcha detection works and how best to avoid it but they never respond. What I will say is that frequent use will trip the captchas. Sending feedback resets that limit, but you'll inevitably get tripped again."

They really don't want to talk to you and are being as passive as possible to make you go away. Makes no sense.

omegle,31sa79,RobearNation,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:31:49 2015 UTC,A) clear any browser cookies relating to Omegle (they might be clever and hide something to prevent usage of VPNs or tag your identity somehow.)

She says she doesn't like you? The friendship is over? Let's be real here. Your friendship is basically an incomplete relationship. That's what you want. If she doesn't want to go out with you, then, really it's up to you. I personally would feel really awkward hanging around with a person who rejected me, but who knows?

omegle,31hyhu,slidedrum,2,Sun Apr 5 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Python expert, but I know a bit about how Omegle works—it stores interests in a cookie. Go put some interests in and check your cookies; you'll find one from Omegle called ""topiclist"" that's organized like this:   [""interest 1"",""interest 2,""interest 3"", … ""interest n""]   The whole thing is ""URL-encoded"" (e.g. %20 = space), or at least it shows that way in Chrome, so it actually looks like   %5B%22interest 1%22%2C%22interest 2%22%2C%22interest 3%22%2C … %22interest n%22%5D   (The general pattern here is %5B%22 at the beginning, for the opening bracket and first opening quote; %22%2C%22 in between interests, for the "","" sequence, and %22%5D at the end, for the last closing quote and the closing bracket.)  Other cookies of interest are ""randid"" (presumably ""random ID""), which I'm guessing is some sort of UUID assigned to you to keep track of who you've recently been connected to (so you don't get people twice in a row); ""fblikes"", which is either 0 (don't use Facebook likes) or 1 (use Facebook likes, which requires you to connect FB to it); and ""uselikes"", also either 0 (don't use interests at all) or 1 (use interests). You'll need the bot to send at least the ""uselikes"" and ""topiclist"" cookies."

I will use Kik to keep in touch with the few cool people I come across. But I'm not adding some random stranger who won't even tell me their age or location (I just assume 50 and India). If I wanted to talk on Kik, I'd be on my phone, not on Omegle.   And I hate that most of these creeps leave off their age so they can lie about it.
