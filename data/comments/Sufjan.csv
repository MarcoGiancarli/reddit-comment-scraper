Sufjan,3e47lf,emma_clouds,2,Tue Jul 21 22:01:28 2015 UTC,Nah I was just chillin in the back of the tent just listening and sufjan walked past with another guy leaving and it took me a sec to register what was happening and once I did I like ran after him and asked for a photo and he was super nice and said selfie!!! When I took the photo and I told him he was incredible and he said thanks and yah that was that
Sufjan,3e47lf,jonnierios,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:10:08 2015 UTC,I waited like 3 hours after his show and never showed up :(

Have you ever heard the recordings that have come from the Ryman? If not, I suggest listening to the Band of Horses live at the Ryman. The album is amazing!   Plus, the Ryman used to be the original Grand Ole Opry, the history alone should get people excited. Not too mention Sufjan is playing there.

Sufjan,3duthl,recyclable1438,10,Sun Jul 19 18:11:49 2015 UTC,The end of The Transiguration has a similar melody to that of the chorus in Chicago
Sufjan,3duthl,hiplink,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"This is the one I immediately thought of.  I always thought of it as this genius thematic allusion to the feelings evoked when you reach the end of Seven Swans.  In the middle of Illinois, it comes as a little reminder to all the Sufjan fans of where we came from.  Maybe I'm looking a little far into it though..."
Sufjan,3duthl,las5h4,7,Mon Jul 20 08:26:21 2015 UTC,He LOVES reusing melodies and they're so rad to pick out. My favorite obscure as fuck one is before Sisyphus they called themselves S/S/S and made a 4 song EP.   Beyond Any Doubt (Listen to the starting chord progression)  Mars from Planetarium  I haven't heard anyone comment on that before so I feel special.  Another minor one is I Am Santa's Helper Using a minor as fuck version of the unreleased Majesty Snowbird. Which is sad as hell because it basically puts the nail in the coffin for Majesty Snowbird ever being actually released imo.  I know there's more but there's two big ones for you!
Sufjan,3duthl,JoshuaGreen0011,2,Sun Jul 19 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Beyond Any Doubt is an incredible song, probably my favorite S/S/S / Sisyphus song. I noticed it too on the Planetarium"

Sufjan,3ddcn1,Fart_Garfunkel,3,Sat Jul 18 02:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's due to the fact that people like to relate to songs. It's hard for most people to relate to songs about homosexual experiences, since most people are not gay. And people then try to find justifications as to if Sufjan is gay or not.   I don't think there's enough evidence to pinpoint his orientation, and until he comes out and explicitly states it, I don't think we'll know for sure."

Sufjan,3dakrk,tgTREX,2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"If you check out the map it seems that the two alternating stages are adjacent to one another and Vernon has been saying the sound system they got is top notch, so I'm thinking it'll be the case that the crowd can basically flip between acts and should be able to hear just fine.

Sufjan,3d04qp,emma_clouds,2,Wed Jul 15 10:35:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed about Eugene. It's so beautiful, and the melody just keeps on giving. I also love Blue Bucket of Gold, but there are just so many good songs on the album. I think this album is Sufjan's tightest collection of songs so far. No fat, no filler, every melody is tightly written and needed, etc"
Sufjan,3d04qp,emma_clouds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:55:52 2015 UTC,Yes yes absolutely. No fillers for sure. It's a very disciplined album - I  imagine he was torn on whether to add one more or not
Sufjan,3d04qp,timmeh_green,2,Wed Jul 15 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"As time passes, my list re-arranges, and every single song on the album has been my favourite at some point (i feel this is common amongst true masterpiece albums) except for Eugene.  I like Eugene, and the lyrical content especially, but it has never been the song on C&L I was most obsessed with at any point.  It just sort of sticks out like a sore thumb.  It's too light and short.  It's like a respite or relief of some sort that I guess maybe the album needs?  I don't know.."
Sufjan,3d04qp,Inzanedude,6,Sun Jul 12 17:37:55 2015 UTC,I love it. It's so soft and delicate.
Sufjan,3d04qp,Expert_in_avian_law,2,Sun Jul 12 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"Relief? Man, every time I hear ""a part of me is lost in your sleeve, where you kept your cigarettes...""  Makes me think about how you would give anything just to see people you love doing mundane stuff."
Sufjan,3d04qp,Tasty_Freeze,3,Mon Jul 13 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"When he sings ""I want to be near you,"" do you think he's referring to Carrie or Lowell? I go back and forth on this.  I like interpreting it as Carrie, because the song is all about how great Lowell is. After everything his stepfather did for him, he's struggling with his desires to just want to be near his mostly absent mother."
Sufjan,3d04qp,timmeh_green,2,Mon Jul 13 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a great song.  By relief, I meant sonically.  The lyrical content is consistent in tone with the rest of the album but the instrumentation and structure and recording all sounds unlike anything else on the album.  It's cool to hear people call it their favourite."
Sufjan,3d04qp,deterritorialized,2,Mon Jul 13 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it until I learned to play it on guitar.  Then, I started to think about how intimate the lyrics are when singing it.  Then, hearing Sufjan sing it in front of 10,000 people almost brought me to tears.  I love hearing how different people's reactions are to these songs.  I haven't been able to get into Fourth of July yet...it's so repetitive.  However, I know that when I start getting sick of my favorites, it will click for me."
Sufjan,3d04qp,Tasty_Freeze,2,Sun Jul 12 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Eugene is absolutely my favorite. It feels like the most intimate song on the album, and perhaps the only one directly about Lowell."
Sufjan,3d04qp,hrmfll,2,Mon Jul 13 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like the unfinished quality really works for the song. A lot of the other songs grapple a bit with larger issues like the role of personal narrative in love and identity, but this song is just so straightforward. It doesn't seem to be trying to make meaning out of anything, just express love and sadness.  I also love that it contains a childlike love for his mother along with an adult acknowledgement of how lucky he was to have his stepfather."

Sufjan,3d04qp,seventhswan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, should have know better has been one of my least favorites from the beginning. I think it's a great piece of work, but similar to Chicago, I think it's one of the better known songs on the album: I wish people would delve even moure into his different works.... ESPECIALLY The avalanche!!    The Only Thing Death With Dignity All Of Me Wants All Of You Carrie & Lowell Blue Bucket of Gold No Shade In The Shadow Of The Cross Eugene John My Beloved Should Have Known Better  Drawn To The Blood   **I cannot place Fourth Of July on here just because it is so emotionally riveting and my favorite and least favorite at the same time.  My list is pretty much based off the main melody of the songs, but I very much love in many of the songs the transitional droning sounds that fade from one song to the next. They make the album very wholesome and really connect the songs together well.   One of my favorite Sufjan albums for sure.... Haven't really decided if I know where it sits in my rankings, don't really know if I ever will.  Long live suf."
Sufjan,3d04qp,Arqueete,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one so far with ""Death With Dignity"" as my top? Here's my attempt at a ranking:   Death With Dignity Fourth of July All of Me Wants All of You No Shade In the Shadow of the Cross Blue Bucket of Gold Eugene Drawn to the Blood The Only Thing Carrie & Lowell Should Have Known Better John My Beloved   I think ""Death With Dignity"" is just so hauntingly beautiful and it is such an effective introduction to the entire album. ""I forgive you, Mother, I can hear you / And I long to be near you / But every road leads to an end...""  There aren't any songs I actually dislike on this album, but I think the songs that I have trouble understanding are the ones that sink to the bottom. ""Carrie & Lowell"" was probably originally last because I couldn't really follow what any of the lyrics were about--that rose a bit when I started to at least get a few more of the lines, like the (probable) Opal Whiteley references, and when I heard the stunning live arrangement. ""Blue Bucket of Gold"" definitely climbed up the list when I learned about the Lost Blue Bucket Mine which just made it all the more heartbreaking. ""John My Beloved"" is pretty and sad but... I still haven't settled on what I really think it's getting at."
Sufjan,3d04qp,seventhswan,2,Mon Jul 13 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"I almost put it as my top. I defiantly agree: he could not have put a more effective opening to this album. And as haunting and intimate as it is, so incredibly beautiful in how bare it is. Never too much happening, but in the best way possible.   I also love at the end, the swelling nature of the drone sounds and the small sense of small old town country. It just sets the stage for Sufjan's younger years living in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  Through much of the album you can literally HEAR his childhood years. He put a lot of thought into this album, despite the very bear nature of the actual music."
Sufjan,3d04qp,izinomics,2,Mon Jul 13 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"dayummm John My Beloved would be in my top 4 for sure, though I can't actually bring myself to make a definitive list. I guess I see it as the one song that talks about when he's home (if you recall in that great pitchfork interview when he says that he drank a lot and did drugs and fucked around to destroy himself), and finding a girl who he was with but felt like he used her because she became another substance for him to abuse and she didn't deserve that. That's my reading of it, though I usually don't like to take songs super literally to find their exact meaning. Maybe the ""you"" in the song is a stand in for all the people he was with, who knows. So sad to see it all the way at the bottom! but I agree, there are no bad songs."

Sufjan,3cuhfl,timmeh_green,2,Sun Jul 12 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate your efforts and it sounds like you're pretty passionate about this which is pretty cool!:)  However, perhaps the very reason the live version was so amazing was because it was just that... The live version.   Seeing him live was probably one of the best experiences of my life and I very much agree that the live versions were AMAZING. The added percussion and levels of melody really added some depth and something different from what the album offered. They really did do an incredible job with arrangements!  By attempting to recreate the live versions you could quite possibly ruin the ""magic"" of what the live concert actually meant to you, because it wasn't simply the amazing album that you've listened to countless times.   I love seeing sufjan passion, (as i am extremely passionate about his music myself),but take what I have to say and think about it!   Good luck!"
Sufjan,3cuhfl,seventhswan,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really like what you've done with this first song.  I think it's important to uphold the integrity of both versions (live and studio) without them stomping on each other and by extending the outro and seamlessly blending it to the live version, you have accomplished that.  I think it would be cool to listen to a version of C&L that just had the instrumental outro sections of songs from the live performance added to the studio songs.    The most difficult but rewarding song would be to somehow get the live ""We're all gonna die!"" outro added to the Fourth of July studio version seamlessly.  Blue Bucket of Gold shouldn't be too difficult."
Sufjan,3cuhfl,timmeh_green,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what you're describing is the ideal scenario. The problem with a lot of the epic endings from the live performance is that they were so loud, that these recordings we have from the shows have terrible clipping (sound peaks beyond what the mics could record) and lose all clarity. In a perfect world I want to somehow recreate some of this myself to maintain the epicness from the show, but also keep good sound quality. I'm hoping to have more time to work on this sometime this week. I'm experimenting with recreating some of the extra sounds and stuff myself, but I'm limited on time and lack of guitar skills. I can emulate a lot on a keyboard though, so that's what I'm hoping to do."
Sufjan,3cuhfl,timmeh_green,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"As a Sufjan fan, I'm much more interested in the clipping, then another artist's overdubs.  There is really no kind way of saying that to you, is there?"
Sufjan,3cuhfl,isitherightword,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"No, I totally get that. I would love to only pull audio from the concert bootlegs, but some of it is so warped that's going to be the really tricky part. I'm going to download more of the concerts and see what kind of audio there is to work with on the loudest parts of the songs and go from there.  If anything I can do a pure version, which is strictly audio from Sufjan, and then I can do my personal version and see how it comes out. This is kind of a learning experience for me, so the more I do the more musical knowledge I can hopefully gain."
Sufjan,3cuhfl,the_lostboyishere,2,Tue Jul 14 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"this is actually a very cool idea and it sounds awesome already. I would particularly love to hear blue bucket of gold and all of me wants all of you. Anyway I have a lot of the ""raw files"" of the bootlegs - I think the best quality ones are the austin bootleg and the brooklyn kings theater for what it's worth, but if you look through the FYSS bootlegs tab and there's one that you particularly would like the raw, non mp3 (so like .wav or .flac) files of let me know. And if you need help with where to upload it to once it's complete let me know that as well. Cool project and best of luck! can't wait to see how it turns out!"

Sufjan,3chqcn,pussyonapedestal,6,Wed Jul 8 00:19:55 2015 UTC,"The song is based on a kid named Opie from his class when he was little. Full quote here  ""I remember in Elementary School when my friend Opie was killed, and it was the first time I really experienced a death of a friend. And the grievance counselor came to school and said: ‘This was Opie’s desk, he no longer occupies the desk. Now he occupies heaven.’ And it was really strange because there was this palpable physical and emotional vacancy where he was. There was this space, this energy beforehand but now it no longer is there which was really difficult for me to kind of manage that. And then as I get older, dealing with other deaths – friends and family, grandparents and my mother – and I started to realize that there’s all these vacancies that are created and yet I still feel this sort of weight – this heaviness from it. So it seems bullshit that there is a vacancy there, there is actually a palpable, physical weight in which we carry around, at least I carry around, and I started to think its because even though they no longer occupy the physical space – they now occupy my space."""

Sufjan,3ccq80,Shadrach451,3,Mon Jul 6 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"Super jealous.  I was at the second show in Seattle and the audience was the worst I have ever experienced.  They improved as the night went on, but in the beginning they were talking, checking their phones, wandering in and our of the theater constantly.  So obnoxious and disrespectful.  And it wasn't just one group either.  It was probably 30% of the crowd.  The worst was during the opening act.  Helado Negro was up there singing his heart out and there was a constant stream of people coming up and down the aisle.  He was like 30 seconds from finishing his last song and ushers were still walking people in with flash lights to their seats on the front row.  And then as soon as he was done the house lights came up and there was a 15 minute long break."
Sufjan,3ccq80,_runningwithscissors,2,Tue Jul 7 00:09:08 2015 UTC,"Wow I'm sorry to hear that. I don't remember the opening act all that well, but when Sufjan was performing it felt as though the entire crowd was listening so intently—and with such respect for the music and its subject matter—that it would be a crime to make a noise. There may have been the occasional shout but it's nothing compared to other concerts I've been to."
Sufjan,3cc9na,AllanOcelot,4,Mon Jul 6 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"That's me :)  thanks for accepting the suggestion. And talking about the album, I think this one was the first album I listened of Sufjan, the one who make me fell in love with his music, it's a very accesible album and pretty much everything song is a perfect introduction to someone who doesn't know Sufjan and you don't want to alienate them as you will do with songs on other albums.  The album is one of those who doesn't age (pretty much as its creator lol), you could listened the album in more five years and you won't think it was released in 2005, all the songs connect so perfect with each other, and at some point you thought he could release another album compared to Illionis but he amuses us with each new album in different ways.  When I first saw Sufjan playing live (a few weeks ago) and he started to play song from this album, I almost start to cry like a baby."
Sufjan,3cc9na,jonnierios,4,Mon Jul 6 21:34:18 2015 UTC,"Unlike a lot of Sufjan fans, I came to Illinois late. When I first heard Sufjan, it was in high school. I think I was listening to Age of Adz because it came out when I was a Junior. And, I was into the electronic music scene. Not that Age of Adz is electronica in anyway, but it came up as a related album on youtube or something. I listened and heard this guy singing about life over these atrocious, strange, magical bubbles of sonic bastardry. It was utterly incredible. I had to explore this whole discog.   I found out, almost to my dismay, that Sufjan's output was extremely varied. It had everything from the softest whisper of a line ""look beneath the floor boards... at the secret I have hid.."" to the loudest cry ""I want to be well"". And, I realized something; Sufjan is on another level of artistry. It goes beyond the style. It's about emotion. Pure and raw.  I did not listen to folk/singer-songwriter/alt.-y type stuff. But, I decided that Sufjan was good enough to take a chance on.   I listened to Illinois all the way through on the recommendation of a friend.   And... wow. It was something else completely. It took me to higher level of consciousness. That may sound dramatic, but tracks like Come on, Feel the Illinoise and Chicago really made me rethink what I thought about music.   I'm a classical musician by ""trade"". But, ever since I heard Illinois, I knew that there was a place in my heart for Sufjan's passion that went beyond any Mozart aria I could think of. The thing about Illinois is that it is uncompromisingly bold in its musical form and harmonic structure. I don't know how many of you care about these kinds of things, but I studied music theory in college for four years. Some of the chords he uses are just... so genius.   The way he starts off with a ballad, too. Not just any ballad either, but like an off-beat, rustling type of song. It just kind of sits with you. And, then it moves into this tribal ring shout where there are all these voices and instruments riffing to a cacophony of ecstasy. I knew that this was another type of music. I keep talking about it... but, when you've always wondered if this type of stuff was out there... and, all you knew was show tunes, and Rossini. lol.   I think that Illinois really changed what music meant to me. I no longer judged expression or emotion based on the end of Aida or Tristan. I found a more realistic expression of elation in the ruminating strums in John Wayne Gacy, Jr. and in the pulsing rhythms of Zombies.  Ugh. :) I just found this sub today. I can't wait to discuss all this stuff with you guys."
Sufjan,3cc9na,the_lostboyishere,2,Tue Jul 7 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think this album has subconsciously become the blueprint for a great album in my mind. An amazing intro, great transitions, fantastic composition, musical and instrumental diversity, and a great ending that gives you a feeling of catharsis or at least musical resolution.   Looking back at it now and comparing it to his other stuff, I think Illinois feels WAY happier and far less restrained than any of his other stuff. He went all out on the compositions. It also kind of feels like an emotional high point in his work, even when you consider songs like Gacy and Casimir. If I were to take cues from the lyrics, I would guess he spent a lot of time vacationing and visiting Illinois from Michigan, so the context of most of his time spent there was likely more positive.  My favorite track is Predatory Wasp, but as I've become more familiar with his entire body of work, I would have to say that Illinois is definitely not my favorite Sufjan album. Although I think it has some of his best compositions and instrumentals, I just kind of feel like I've outgrown it a bit. Also, I can't even count the number of times I've listened to it.  I wish there was a studio version of Majesty Snowbird, and I think The Mistress Witch from McClure is the best song that didn't make it onto Illinois."
Sufjan,3cc9na,signsandwonders,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"a great ending that gives you a feeling of catharsis or at least musical resolution.   My god this cannot be emphasized enough. I first listened to the album on a flight to Illinois and for a while it became tradition for me to listen to the album in full whenever I flew anywhere. Listening to UFO followed by Blackhawk War always gave me this wonderful feeling of ""beginning"", and Out of Egypt is a perfect cathartic end to the album, letting me know everything is okay..."
Sufjan,3cc9na,EeyoreSmore,2,Mon Jul 6 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Casimir Pulaski Day is the first piece of music that ever made me feel raw emotion. I just didn't understand how transformative music could be before that. Sufjan opened my eyes to a whole other world with this album, and for that I will be forever grateful."
Sufjan,3cc9na,seventhswan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think that this album serves a very special place in the hearts of all Sufjan Stevens lovers. Not only was this the album that Sufjan really took off, I think this was the first album he really took a leap of faith- probably the best risk of his life! hahah His instrumentation throughout the whole album astounds me. The very simple melodies played over one another to create a complex abstract masterpiece that's hard to pick apart or reduce to one element. The flow of one song to the next is honestly beyond me, and the contrast in both sound and topic in each one of the songs make for a full hearted journey that can make any listener hear familiarity. The only real bummer(dare I say) about this album is that it's so grand, it feels incomplete if not listened to all together. A smart move on Sufjan's part- a bummer for us; quite honestly there are only a few songs that can be listened to without the company of the whole album(or some of the other tracks)- taking into account the numerous interludes and little ""plug ins"" of joy. I agree with others that the Mistress Witch From McClure is the best outtake from The Avalanche and I think that Illinois could have been deconstructed more for listening to songs on a singular basis had he replaced some of the emotional, but pointless interludes with songs with a bit more depth. But alas! I don't doubt Sufjan for a second. And considering the fact that he was going for a song about the state of Illinois, but delivered on all fronts. This album remains and probably will remain one of my favorites many albums to come. UFO, Come on! Feel the Illinoise!, Prairie Fire, and Predatory Wasps are my favorite songs. Great man.

Sufjan,3carip,unplacid,9,Mon Jul 6 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"I really had to talk myself down from literally screaming with joy at this part:   And besides, complaints that Stevens is too delicate or twee is basically coded homophobia and misogyny from those who don’t like their traditional notions of masculinity toyed with in any way."

This is really lovely stuff. Yes, I feel the Suf energy in you... but, I also feel like we need more of this music before it becomes ""boring"" and ""overused"".   Keep it up. I can't wait to hear the whole album. Also, let me know if you want any criticism or advice. I had some thoughts but I didn't want to just blurt them out in public or something."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,the_lostboyishere,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That is very kind of you to say. I'd love criticism and advice! The whole reason I started this project was to learn, so I'd love to hear what other people have to say on how they think it can be improved."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,the_lostboyishere,2,Tue Jul 7 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think some of your diction is TOO good for the style. Go back and listen to this track. I wonder if a more relaxed speech would work better.  Sufjan definitely doesn't always even say words intelligibly. lol.   I'm a classical musician, so when I record folk, this is my hardest challenge. I just noticed some of your ending consonants were ""too"" pristine for me."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,s0nnyjames,2,Tue Jul 7 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting critique! I'll definitely go back and listen to it with that in mind. Usually when friends listened they said they couldn't understand what I was singing, so I may have overcompensated."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,MUTGraphics,3,Tue Jul 7 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"I thought this was beautiful. Regardless of Sufjan comparisons, it stands on its own two feet and you should be well proud. Lovely progressions, voice, great lyrics. Great job! Looking forward to July 21 :)"

It's an homage to Sufjan Stevens' ""50 States Project"" in both style and subject.  The link includes a free download of the song; I'm not trying to make any money off of this, just looking for feedback. If you've got three minutes to spare to check it out I'd really appreciate the support. I'm still pretty new at this.  Thank you for reading, thank you for listening!"
Sufjan,3c8xxt,Youthz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:30:27 2015 UTC,Are you releasing the album as like a legitimate album that you're going to promote and sell or are you just releasing it for free?
Sufjan,3c8xxt,CultMemberICOC,2,Mon Jul 6 01:18:50 2015 UTC,"No, I'm still releasing it for free. I felt weird assuming people would want to pay for it, and it also didn't feel right to try to make money off of this since it's so heavily influenced by Sufjan. I'm still trying to promote it and make it as legitimate as possible; I just don't care if I make money."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,CultMemberICOC,2,Mon Jul 6 17:01:27 2015 UTC,Thought the first song was great! Looking forward to hearing the finished product. What was your recording setup?
Sufjan,3c8xxt,Grizzlyhorse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"I primarily recorded just in my bedroom. I've got an M-Track audio recorder and an audio-technica mic. For software I use Reaper, which I believe is free to download; it has served me well for many years. Mostly I just recorded multiple layers of instruments/vocals with the mic, and sometimes added piano/bass/etc midi tracks."
Sufjan,3c8xxt,wekillpeoplewithguns,2,Tue Jul 7 21:10:49 2015 UTC,Dude I live in NH and I've been wanting to do this since I heard Illinois 4 years ago. I actually started working on it but it's a bit more chamber-y/rock-y than what you've got. Maybe when I'm finished we can compare :D
Sufjan,3c8xxt,emma_clouds,2,Tue Jul 7 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is awesome! I'd love to hear what you've got!"
Sufjan,3c8xxt,ethanwc,2,Tue Jul 7 21:07:30 2015 UTC,I think this is pretty cool. What if Sufjan fans united to finish the 50 States Project by releasing albums for their own states?
Sufjan,3c8xxt,heathenethan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:03:36 2015 UTC,That's what I've always secretly hoped for this project. Maybe someone else would hear it and be inspired to create one for their own state of choice.

Sufjan,3c8xxt,ethanwc,6,Mon Jul 6 00:34:10 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it! I'm not trying to copy Sufjan so much as do an homage to his musical style. I'm hoping by acknowledging the fact that this is his style and not mine will help people understand that I'm not trying to capitalize on his sound; I'm simply trying learn from it and respect it in new ways. Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks for listening!

John is a wonderful guy and if in his ""Humble Opinion"" he thinks it sounds better, I'm taking that as it sounds amazing. Remastered and re-issued, let's just hope they don't make it a limited edition colour run, as Sufjan vinyl is quickly becoming something to buy and re-sell to collectors at triple the price (See exploding whale,  EYR re-release).  We know Planetarium is in the works for a release, but given Sufjan's tour and the likely hood of Christmas material, I'd say an ETA is April next year? Maybe before? But certainly by then.

Obviously I have no way to show a back catalog from Urban Outfitters in the early 2000's, but these designs are not unique to Sufjan.

Sufjan,3bu0q5,MUTGraphics,4,Thu Jul 2 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed! To me, Michigan beats Illinois. Overall the songs are stronger on Illinois, but Michigan combines into the best album by far. I think it can be heard Sufjan has a much deeper connection with the state of Michigan, it's just there.  My favourite is probably Age of Adz. But it's so hard to choose! Right?"
Sufjan,3bu0q5,Zima-Blue,5,Fri Jul 3 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"Michigan is fantastic.  I don't think it's slept on but maybe just less discussed.  Now A Sun Came, that's another story."
Sufjan,3bu0q5,lunarlander,2,Thu Jul 2 12:56:38 2015 UTC,Truly a modern classic.
Sufjan,3bu0q5,Golden_Buddha,3,Thu Jul 2 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"I believe this is because Michigan didn't really have a 'hit' song. Like yeah it has Holland, Romulus, and ect, but it doesn't really have a hit track. Where, Illinois has John Wayne Gacy, and Chicago of course. And Seven Swans has To Be Alone With You and The Dress Looks Nice on you. And Carrie and Lowell have Fourth of July and Should Have Known Better.  I think Michigan gets much more praise than Age of Adz, in my opinion. But overall the songs by themselves are, ok. The album altogether is good. These are just my thoughts on this."
Sufjan,3bu0q5,isitherightword,3,Fri Jul 3 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"I love Michigan. When it comes down to it, it has the highest concentration of my ""favorite Sufjan songs"" on it. I think the reason Michigan gets overlooked sometimes is because he basically used the same framework but completely turned it on it's head for Illinoise. Michigan is much quieter and Illinoise hogs a lot of it's attention because it's bigger and bolder and all that. It doesn't make Michigan any less beautiful though. It's definitely one of my favorites."
Sufjan,3bu0q5,Bert306,2,Fri Jul 3 03:21:34 2015 UTC,Michigan is one of my favourite. It seems very personal to me as he sings about him growing up in the state. He also has a great scene of the state's struggles and strong points.

Sufjan,3br100,wekillpeoplewithguns,8,Wed Jul 1 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"He works with pro tools when writing I believe. Alot of AOA was recorded at home (Synths, mastering). Acoustic work being done at a Brooklyn studio (Session musicians, orchestral track recordings).  Sufjan's equipment list for Adz was expensive, this is a man who likes his noise and quality synths (As someone pointed out, he uses the Prophet 08 - one of the best synths on the planet for a great wide phat sound).  If you are looking for an entry into the ""Same sound""  -  he also used the Mopho by Dave Smith on AOA - it's a good synth that I recommend to all musicians, regardless of genre. Very versatile and retains its value.  I'd recommend you invest in some serious guitar pedals too, Sufjan's AOA features phasers, tone shifters, plenty of reverb and repeaters. You should be able to get a good assortment of pedals for cheap pre-owned, just remember, you get what you pay for with instruments and gear.  If you are after a specific sound and want advice on how to replicate, let me know."

Sufjan,3bitab,frog_wiz,2,Tue Jun 30 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"A friend and I embarked on the same tour as part of a larger trip the day the album came out. Make sure you don't miss spencers butte - it's an awesome hike. But I hope it's still a bit wet up there, the mist and moisture really made the hike for us."
Sufjan,3bitab,timmeh_green,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, we didn't have the time to spend more than a couple hours in Eugene. We're planning to hit up the Sea Lion Caves today though, and in a couple days we're going to see the Painted Hills!"
Sufjan,3bbsiw,Indignantpuff,6,Sat Jun 27 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"I hadn't really considered them to be connected before. I have to admit that I hadn't actually heard that line in ""Calm it Down"" until you'd mentioned it, but I think that they're both songs about anxiety and anger building up and exploding (or not exploding), and ultimately, acceptance.  The ""Vesuvius"" that Sufjan refers to is his perception of his true nature; something within him that he's struggling with (""the panic inside""). It's a deep part of his personality, or his soul, that he despises, or is fearful of, that is killing him (""the murdering ghost""). It's building up, and he has to accept his fate. He's admitting that he feels it's presence (""that you cannot ignore"").  He's asking Vesuvius to ""fall on [him] now"" as he favors the host/ghost. He's asking for this thing that's been building up to just explode NOW. Now, while he's being honest about it. Now, while he CAN accept and own it.  Overall, to me, ""Vesuvius"" comes across as massively paranoid and anxious (and is incredibly relatable because of this!). This is how it FEELS to get into this state of mind, despising yourself, feeling that you're seeing who you really are (which is an awful thing), doubting your own morality, recognizing that you're about to launch into some really deplorable, destructive behaviour, and believing that you have no control over it.  So, ""Calm it Down"" is then akin to the conversation you have with your therapist. This song similarly describes anxious, paranoid and destructive thoughts and feelings, but also instructs Sufjan (or whomever) to ""calm it down."" It's a rational response to ""Vesuvius.""  When Sufjan comes into the song, he starts questioning what might have caused this, even (""was it the drugs I take? was it ambitious outbreak?""), which makes it even more like a therapy session, I feel. He starts taking ownership of it (""mine is the pressure, mine is the pain"") and that's when ""it's in your favour"" comes in. In both songs, it's in Sufjan's favor to own up to this, because that's the only way he can get past it, or calm it down.  I love this question, I think that this is the kind of discussion we need on this sub!"
Sufjan,3bbsiw,Luminitha,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"How I was kind of thinking about it is that for me Vesuvius is song of acceptance in some aspects... Especially the line ""I can now be made to laugh"". I get that from Calm it Down as well... I just thought it was amazing that after listening to the song a few times and thinking the whole time ""that chord pattern sounds so familiar..."" to actually hearing it through headphones was pretty awesome hahaha."
Sufjan,3bbsiw,AllanOcelot,3,Sun Jun 28 15:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't get what you are discussing here?  Vesuvius - from age of adz can be interpreted as many many things depending on who hears it. For myself it represents Sufjan trying to reassure himself in a higher power as he matures in life.   (I'd rather be burned than be living in debt)  (Symbols of light? or of fantasy host?)  (Follow me now as I favor the ghost)  All of these lines to me point to a man questioning how hard it can be for one to keep their belief in something. The people of Pompeii were religious up until the very end, but that did not save them.  Regardless of my own interpretation of the song, Calm it down is in no way related. (Unless Sufjan, Serengetti or AKR care to clarify)  Calm it down by Sissyphus is a song about ...calming it down, dealing with the stresses that come with modern living  (Sending telegram after telegram)  (...like you just cannot stop, talking shit about each other...)  (When time stands still, can you tell me how you feel)  (I'm on my own two feet, but im not standing upright)  Again, to me these point towards modern living, the social stresses we face that we did not have 15 years ago, towards the end the lyrics suggest someone tried to live ""Off the social grid"" (I'm on my own two feet) but could not do so (but I'm not standing upright) and then questions why (Was it the drugs I take? etc)  my two cents. If you can clarify the question that might help."
Sufjan,3bbsiw,AllanOcelot,2,Sat Jun 27 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"I also just thought that it was interesting that they would sample something from Age of Adz in the Sisyphus album. I think it's really interesting to bring parts of Vesuvius into this song. It just makes me think more about both songs, y'know?"
Sufjan,3bbsiw,NotThePancake,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that I don't agree - it is an interesting point, rather I did not understand your question nor do I think there is any connection between the two songs, these kinds of topics are fun as Sufjan's songs are so vague they mean many things to different fans."
Sufjan,3bbsiw,AllanOcelot,2,Sun Jun 28 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure OP just wants input as to how ""Calm it Down"" could be connected to ""Vesuvius"" because they both feature the line ""It's in your favor"" sung in the background in a similar way."
Sufjan,3bbsiw,NotThePancake,0,Sun Jun 28 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"but there is no connection, hence the explanation of the lyrics."

Sufjan,3b8k5w,pussyonapedestal,3,Fri Jun 26 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"Hey Everyone, I saw this post on while browsing on my own account-and figured i’d chime in.  I work for Ebbets Field Flannels. We've been producing authentic vintage baseball caps, flannel jerseys, vintage football/hockey sweaters, and much more in the USA, for over 26 years.  Anyways- we partner with the Seattle Theater Group to make gifts for artists/bands as thank you’s (usually for multiple sell-out shows). We’ve done a jersey for Jack White, a jacket for Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson,  Jeresy’s and Caps for the Replacements, a jacket for Dave Chapelle, and this jacket for Sufjan Stevens.   Just like you all - I’m a huge Sufjan Stevens fan- and when we got the call to do a special project for him- I was very excited. Myself and our designer, Toron, came up with this design. I wanted the jacket to be heavily grounded in vintage/historic. The idea’s of neon colored satin were thrown around— but we went with this simpler design.   The jacket body is actually based off vintage New York City MTA Mechanic’s Jacket- we used that Public Transportation theme as guidance for the rest of the jacket. The design on the back is inspired heavily by an old public trolly/bus system here in Seattle called “Seattle Transit”. We made a few design tweaks (like adding water)-- the details in the tree’s and mountains (as well as the lettering) are chain-stitched on- it turned out incredible, here is a close up image of the back. We decided to do the yellow lining, because I thought the jacket did need a bit of “pop”, and it also is a nod to the colors of the Oregon State flag (since he was touring Carrie & Lowell), and the color of the Seattle Transit Bus'.   Thought y’all would be interested in hearing about it.  Thanks for posting the picture, OP.  Here are some photos of Seattle Transit that we used as inspiration.   Cheers,  Brian  Ebbets Field Flannels"

Sufjan,3b29ch,hiplink,4,Thu Jun 25 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"Here is the next installment of the Throwback Thursday photo of Sufjan: two side-by-side candid photos from a page out of his senior yearbook.  If you remember, both me and my sister went to the same school as Sufjan, and she was in his graduating class. She is in the picture on the left, the only girl in the back row. You will see her in a few pictures with Sufjan later as well.  The released Throwback Thursday photos are posted to this gallery: http://imgur.com/a/thXW8 and below are the upcoming photos:   Week 1 - Sufjan’s High School Senior Picture (released) Week 2 - Sufjan Candids (released) Week 3 - Sufjan in hallway with wearing stocking cap and tie Week 4 - Sufjan on Men's Varsity Basketball team (action shot of him shooting a free throw) Week 5 - Sufjan playing piano Week 6 - Sufjan on Soccer team Week 7 - Sufjan on missions trip Week 8 - Sufjan's Awards Night Week 9 - Picture from Sufjan's art class"
Sufjan,3b29ch,Gobbles15,3,Thu Jun 25 11:36:15 2015 UTC,"If I might say something. This seems really rather creepy in my opinion. Posting an old photo of Sufjan you have found online or in a newspaper is fine, but to me, having a planned event based around posting an old photo just seems really odd. Even the title ""Sufjan candids"" just screams weird to me. Imagine if you became famous and then stumbled across a forum in which people are planning a 9 week extravaganza in which they'll post old photos of yourself. You wouldn't feel right would you ?"
Sufjan,3b29ch,nowl9,6,Thu Jun 25 12:05:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel like you're overthinking it.  It's cool to have some insight into his life and someone has old photos laying around. I don't know about you, but I'd like to see them. No point in having them rot away in a box."

There is a holy grail of Sufjan Recording Knowledge in an old interview here.  Essentially Sufjan recorded all of his albums until Age Of Adz on an RS-880 (I have one, it's not easy to use) and then dumped each track into ProTools, lining them up by eye/ear.  He used shure mic's to track his guitars - it's difficult to tell by ear on his most recent albums but they still sound as warm (A trademark of Shure mics).  His piano songs (Owl and tanager) recorded the piano at a Brooklyn church (Maybe the one owned by Vito Aiuto).  Sufjan is a fan of Dave Smith (The granddaddy of synths) synths and the Prophet 6 and Mopho both take center stage during age of adz.  I'm in work at the moment, so post any questions etc and I will try to respond with my knowledge when I finish :)"

Sufjan,3aby75,signsandwonders,4,Thu Jun 18 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"This is a wordcloud made from the lyrics of the album. Common words such as I, me, you, my, etc. don't show. Otherwise ""I"" is the most common word on this album.   Also, I know this isn't the best word cloud. I'm sure someone could make a prettier one. I just used the first site I found and I don't consider it ""artwork"". It's just really cool to see the most-used words on the album.  On that note, I'd love to see someone make a word cloud for each major Sufjan album to compare the difference in use of language between them. That would be really cool! Or maybe some other way of displaying the information with some cool graphs worthy of /r/dataisbeautiful :)"
Sufjan,3aby75,Shadrach451,2,Sat Jun 20 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised that ""Dead"" is so frequent.  Yet ""Die"" is nowhere to be found.  Since ""We're all gonna die"" is a repeated line in ""Fourth of July"".  Cool cloud though.  It's fun trigger each words location on the album as you browse through it."
Sufjan,3aaael,imacericg,28,Thu Jun 18 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"Both my sister and I attended the same high school as Sufjan, and she was in his graduating class of only 14 from a small Christian school in northern Michigan. If you guys want more of these ""Throwback Thursday / Sufjan from High School” pictures and the moderator thinks it's appropriate, I have about a dozen more I could share on future Thursday's including him playing basketball (“look alive out there”), soccer, playing the piano, wearing stocking cap, etc.  EDIT: I scanned in the remaining Sufjan pictures from the yearbook and will be sharing them in future #TBT. The pictures are:   Week 1 - *Sufjan’s High School Senior Picture Week 2 - *Sufjan Candids Week 3 - *Sufjan in hallway with wearing stocking cap and tie Week 4 - Sufjan on Men's Varsity Basketball team (action shot of him shooting a free throw) Week 5 - *Sufjan playing piano Week 6 - Sufjan on Soccer team Week 7 - Sufjan on missions trip Week 8 - Sufjan's Awards Night Week 9 - Picture from Sufjan's art class   The * are the best pictures of Sufjan in my opinion. Hope everyone enjoys!"

She was out of the country when All Delighted People EP dropped, so I worked Lowell (yes, ""the Lowell"") at Asthmatic Kitty to get backstage access at one of his concerts to get Sufjan to sign the LP for my sister. Didn't meet him (bummer), but got it signed.  To answer your question, they haven't talked in 10 years probably."

Sufjan,3a82dc,Amerikaner,3,Thu Jun 18 00:31:30 2015 UTC,I really hope Carrie & Lowell gets recognition at awards shows this year. It really deserves it.
Sufjan,3a82dc,Chronic_Apathy1,2,Thu Jun 18 10:35:09 2015 UTC,So glad to see Sufjan getting some love.
Sufjan,3a86w2,ByTheCreed,9,Thu Jun 18 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"Okay now we just need to get AKR to see this: Fans have been hyped about this for literally years now. Make it a special boxset, similar to Songs for Christmas. Include mythology, pictures, lore, writings and drawings about our solar system in there. Maybe a DVD of a performance. Maybe a specialized 7"" vinyl release of each. The kicker - the vinyl looks like its respective planet in colors and form. Imagine spinning Jupiter on your player with yellows, oranges and reds and seeing the Great Red Spot spin past."
Sufjan,3a86w2,deterritorialized,7,Thu Jun 18 12:19:15 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome! But the project really belongs to the trio rather than Sufjan himself, so we can't really speak to where it will land and what it will look like.   We at AKR will probably stick to our previous comment, but we'd definitely love to see the project turn into a meaningful, tangible experience."
Sufjan,3a86w2,timmeh_green,3,Thu Jun 18 18:53:36 2015 UTC,Someone needs to hire this person in production.  Seriously...what a great idea!
Sufjan,3a86w2,sukalue88,0,Thu Jun 18 12:37:20 2015 UTC,AKR wants you to know that they've read your comment and are now following your suggestions aiming for a 2019 release date.
Sufjan,3a86w2,signsandwonders,6,Thu Jun 18 14:01:07 2015 UTC,"The text, if you don't want to read the whole Q&A:   Is the Planetarium Barbican show you did a couple of years ago with Sufjan Stevens and Nico Muhly going to get a release?  Yeah we've actually nearly finished recording that. So that will come out sometime in the not too distant future.   According to the article, the interview was conducted mid-May."
Sufjan,3a86w2,Shadrach451,5,Thu Jun 18 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"I would be so happy if we got a release by the end of the summer or at the very worse, end of this year."
Sufjan,3a86w2,signsandwonders,3,Thu Jun 18 01:13:11 2015 UTC,I feel like it's been on the horizon for the past three years! Great news either way.
Sufjan,3a86w2,JoshuaGreen0011,3,Thu Jun 18 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"I wonder what Name they will put on it.  I mean, all of us here probably feel like it's a Sufjan record, but it's not.  And his past collaborations have all taken on group names.  I'm mostly refering to S/S/S things.  What name did they tour it under?  ""Bryce Dessner, Nico Muhly & Sufjan Stevens""?  Seems a bit cumbersome."

Sufjan,3a531z,pussyonapedestal,2,Wed Jun 17 08:07:17 2015 UTC,FYI There is no explanation in this video for the title AGE OF ADZ nor what ADZ refers to.  I have yet to uncover this anywhere.
Sufjan,3a531z,timmeh_green,5,Wed Jun 17 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"don’t know! I don’t know… I mean the “Adz” is really a misspelling of “Odds.” That’s taken from Royal Robertson, he has all kinds of text in his work, and his visions are all written out in this messy script. He was a sign painter for a living before he was an artist, and his signs became double entendres, messages that had dual meanings, because of all the misspellings and grammatical mistakes. The Age of Adz is reflecting the subconscious, free association way of thinking that happens when you’re not censoring yourself. Royal’s work is very much about impulsive free association, and the lyrics on The Age of Adz also follow that.   ~Sufjan  in other words its just a misspelling of odds from Royal Robertson the borderline-schizo who did all the art for the album was an inspiration during the albums recording"

Sufjan,3a3lh3,thelattergaysaint,11,Tue Jun 16 23:27:37 2015 UTC,But this song though...
Sufjan,3a3lh3,MUTGraphics,5,Wed Jun 17 03:00:49 2015 UTC,I feel like this does everything to only help encourage gay fans like me that we have a chance.
Sufjan,3a3lh3,JoshuaGreen0011,8,Thu Jun 18 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"All For Myself is one that I feel always flies under the radar because of its relatively short length and placement on the album, but it comes off as quite queer.    We set out once forget our shirts/With hairy chests and well rehearsed/I want it all/I want it all for myself  Out in the earth I smell of you/Of bathing boy, amazing you/I want it all/I want it all for myself"
Sufjan,3a3lh3,SteadilyTremulous,5,Wed Jun 17 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"On predatory wasp, I've always viewed this song as being from a female's perspective.  The line, Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers seem to suggest a female as not many men own leg warmers."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Mrhurricanefred,5,Sat Jun 20 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sufjan mentioned that it's about his childhood, though. Look up a live performance on YouTube."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Vladith,3,Wed Jun 17 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Well, he's talked about how they used to live in his grandma's summerhouse for a while. And it got really cold during the winter because they had no heating or insulation, and sometimes had to close off the second floor. To me the song starts out when he's home during the winter and he's thinking back at summer camp. The reason he is wearing so much clothing to bed is because it's freezing. I just don't see how people get so caught up in the line about the leg warmers, I mean he's also wearing three coats, that's a lot stranger I think. If he was cold and was not going anywhere why not wear leg warmers too?"
Sufjan,3a3lh3,emblapolaris,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"Same from what I've read and heard from the internet, the song is supposed to be interpreted from a female perspective."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,sukalue88,5,Thu Jun 18 13:50:14 2015 UTC,"Here are some songs and lines that come to mind and some genius analysis:   -Drawn To The Blood  -All of Me Wants All of You  -The Predatory Wasp...!  -Futile Devices  And then there's this curious reddit post here  Sufjan is often portrayed as shrouded in mystery. Although he seems to pour out some of the most intimate and personal of his feelings and memories to his listeners, people seem to think of his still as some kind of mythical man, a poet-prophet-whatever-you-call-it. This article discusses the enigma of his identity in a neat way I think. Good luck!"
Sufjan,3a3lh3,deliriousfunkypriest,6,Wed Jun 17 22:03:32 2015 UTC,Apparently there is a facebook page called “Is this Sufjan song gay or just about God?”.

Sufjan,3a3lh3,Praying__Mantis,4,Wed Jun 17 02:59:54 2015 UTC,PST  A few weeks ago I compiled a playlist of his most queer songs on youtube and spotify.  If you guys have any more suggestions please share! I haven't gotten any more than the 12 songs already on there but I still feel there are more I'm forgetting about.
Sufjan,3a3lh3,zoeseeya,3,Thu Jun 25 03:41:06 2015 UTC,THIS is what I was looking for.  Not a debate about his sexuality.  Thank you!
Sufjan,3a3lh3,bonniedi,3,Fri Jun 19 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Check out the Uncut interview with Suf: ""Asked by Uncut magazine whether the abusive relationship described in ""Drawn To The Blood"" was his own, Stevens simply answered ""yes""."" http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/sufjan-stevens-interviewed-you-have-to-cast-out-your-demons-68047  I'm divided on discussing Sufjan's sexuality. On the one hand, it doesn't matter. He is clearly not hiding his sexuality but neither does he feel the need to be 'out'. But on the other hand, maybe it is relevant in understanding some of the conflicts in his work. I have a long-held theory that Impossible Soul is about being in love with someone that you, as hard as you try, do not have sexual feelings for."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Parsonel,9,Fri Jun 19 03:23:30 2015 UTC,Who cares if he's gay dude.
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Fart_Garfunkel,2,Thu Jun 18 13:30:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be supposed if he's bisexual. He still has numerous songs about girls, so I don't quite think he's gay. Nothing wrong with all, his ""gay"" songs are some of my favorites."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,deterritorialized,3,Wed Jun 17 03:57:49 2015 UTC,"While I think that some lyrics can be construed as sexual in some sense (some more obvious than others), To Be Alone With You and Predatory Wasp are two songs that I think people selfishly impose sexual overtones where none exist.  I think that Sufjan's Art is too nuanced for those songs to be about something so blatant.  In fact, I find it ironic that some people who criticize Christians for imposing too much biblical meaning into Sufjan's songs (which I definitely think happens) also impose too much of their own sexual meaning onto his songs.  I would even go so far as to say that pre-Adz Sufjan keeps very distant from sexuality by keeping the content in a sort of naive worldview on relationships.  In that sense, reading strongly sexualized meanings into the songs really strips them of their beauty.  Of course, this is all my opinion, and not much is at stake in that."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,ethanwc,2,Wed Jun 17 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"Remember that episode of Southpark where Cartman takes love songs and just changes ""baby"" to ""jesus""?   I don't think he's gay. He seems pretty grounded in Christianity, although it's ambiguous because, well, Christianity isn't a popular belief in media outlets."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Joshooa79,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think most the time he's talking about guys it's from another point of view, like what a girl would say or think. If he is bi, that's great if not that's great. I thought I was bi for a while but after making out with a gay friend it turns out I wasn't. But I can appreciate a good looking guy. I think all are beautiful."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Vladith,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's very clear that he's bisexual? He sings about and women in very personal, oftentimes sexual terms."
Sufjan,3a3lh3,Jlloll,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Also, never quickly interpret that the singer is the narrator of lyrics in a song. The first mistake anyone can make is that the writer is the speaker. You must look at a text for clues in the text and not read something into the song. Just because it's Suf singing doesn't mean he is the speaker."

Sufjan,39mxdz,simbajam13,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"He did, as Vesuvius is my favorite song on age of Adz I was really excited. The synchronization with the lights and the little screen they had in the background, which played cool little fire graphics during the latter portion of the song, it was very enjoyable.  The little intro/lead in to it, and the fact he played the song ""The Dress Looks Nice On You"" was easily one of the most memorable parts for me, I found it pretty chill."
Sufjan,39mxdz,blop101,2,Sat Jun 13 00:07:30 2015 UTC,This was the one song I wanted him to play Wednesday night that he didn't! Ugh.

Sufjan,39mxdz,NickShady,2,Sat Jun 13 04:53:09 2015 UTC,"""Blue Bucket of Gold"" was amazing.  I really would love to hear studio recordings of these reworked versions of the songs.  They were just so completely different from the gorgeous whisper quiet versions on the album.  He is a master of his sound.  I'm amazed that he was able to not just rearrange the song order, but also rearrange construct the songs themselves into this complex cathartic explosion.  The visuals were a big part of that too (The search lights scanning the audience during ""We are all gonna die. We are all gonna die."" was chilling.)  And I have never been brought to tears by brain numbing static like I did at the end of ""Blue Bucket of Gold"" as he brought the audience into the light.  Seriously if that is what it is like to die, I have no fear.  I invite it.  I feel like I have seen the world melt beneath me.  It was a good concert.  I wish I could do it again.  If anyone knows of some high quality live recordings, please point me to them."

There's a couple moments that have more of an edge, but I'm a little concerned for that kind of trajectory-- the sort-of easy listening, NPR, educated/sophisticated listener.  Pitchfork: So it was a dig at yourself when you titled it that way.  Sufjan: Yeah, because I think there is something very ""easy listening"" about my music. My colleague at Asthmatic Kitty, Michael Kaufman, comes from a noise/improv scene, and he's always making fun of me for being so accessible. He's been challenging me to sort of undermine that, how to responsibly sabotage the listenability of my music in order to challenge it. And I think right now, creatively, I need to go somewhere where I'm taking greater risks. [With] The Avalanche, I think the songs are interesting, I think they're successful, and I think there's a lot to learn from them. But I also think it's a bit too much of the same stuff over and over again."

I would kill to hear a recording of that show and am really looking forward to hearing what it was like at the very least. I i'm sure it's gonna be pretty emotional for him and for the audience. Anyway I took a look at stubhub and there are still tickets but they're marked up like crazy. Good luck, and if you go do come and tell us about it!"
Sufjan,38uc5p,_DoubleN_,6,Sat Jun 6 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"""Sufjan masterfully combines agnosticism with Christianity, expressing the confusion and uncertainty of faith through the use of juxtaposition.""  This could be put in a much better way...something like Sufjan expresses a genuine commitment to Christianity in that he honestly communicates his experiences of uncertainty and doubt.  The longer I listen to Sufjan, the more I believe that he is influenced by Kierkegaard, who sees uncertainty as an essential component of Christian faith.  Kierkegaard would say that agnosticism is the opposite of uncertainty/doubt/anxiety.  Uncertainty/doubt communicates care, while agnosticism relates more to irony...the constant floating between ideas...entertaining all, but committed to none.  I dunno...I just think that Sufjan's faith is genuine, and the tension that causes his art.  JMO."

Sufjan,38uc5p,deterritorialized,2,Sun Jun 7 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely...if anything, he's worth looking into to understand a modern Protestant Christian dealing with religion against the various questions of modernity.  It's surprisingly relevant (considering that he wrote almost 200 years ago)."
Sufjan,38t5zd,CaliforniaGrapin,4,Sat Jun 6 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"Not the adz tour, but the Crystal Ballroom recording is one of the all time best Sufjan concert recordings out there. It's from the Illinois era and has a fantastic version of Majesty Snowbird."
Sufjan,38t5zd,mothman607,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"agree that crystal ballroom is one of the better ones. austin city limits and fox theater are two other popular ones as well from the older tours. Lee's place is also good. Those 4 are a good place to start but to be honest the person who put together the original list didn't post any ""bad ones"" they're all worth listening to. :)"

Sufjan,38t5zd,Peteriffic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:27:36 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you specifically wan the 5-13 show but if not there is the 5-12 show on that tumblr blog.
Sufjan,38t9qf,OptionK,33,Sat Jun 6 16:58:43 2015 UTC,I didn't dance because dancing to songs about someone's mother dying feels weird to me
Sufjan,38t9qf,oopssorrydaddy,9,Sat Jun 6 19:15:50 2015 UTC,"nothing like dancing to the Fourth of July! ""We're all gonna diiiieeee!"" lol but no seriously I think this tour is supposed to be more spiritual and maybe even religious."
Sufjan,38t9qf,Golden_Buddha,6,Sat Jun 6 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"No. Not one single person danced at the show I went to, thankfully. It was a seated theater, but seeing people dancing to this kind of music would've taken me out of the experience. Why would you dance to this tour?"
Sufjan,38t9qf,ThePrius,2,Sat Jun 6 21:48:57 2015 UTC,Because the common response to hearing groovy music you enjoy is to move your body a little bit? Why wouldn't you?
Sufjan,38t9qf,ThePrius,3,Sun Jun 7 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"Okay well in your original post, you said dancing, so I figured you guys were out of your seat and actually dancing or something. But yeah, there was some head bobbing and stuff like that. Not so much the Carrie and Lowell songs, but when he played Chicago you can bet your ass a bunch of people (including myself and my friends) were ""dancing"" in their seats."
Sufjan,38t9qf,ThePrius,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that's my bad. I guess I assumed it was clear that a certain degree of dancing wouldn't be appropriate. Should have said that though. All I was really looking for was something other than absolute motionlessness. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that no one was moving at all. It was shocking to me."
Sufjan,38t9qf,Mauri_San,2,Sun Jun 7 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah not movement at all is pretty weird. Not sure if it was just your show or what, but there was plenty of head bobbing at mine."
Sufjan,38t9qf,DontCareWhoKnowsIt,0,Sun Jun 7 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that not many songs are danceable, but some are, and plenty warrant some minimal motion (head bobbing, swaying, etc.). So it's weird to me that no one else was doing any of that."
Sufjan,38t9qf,jubaxor,4,Sat Jun 6 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"I generally go by two rules of thumb. (1) If there is seating, then more than likely stay seated - his live shows are super nuanced musically, his live versions of songs, and technically, with the lights and projections. It's cooler to take it as a whole and pay close attention to what he's doing. It also depends on where you're seated; don't stand if you're going to be in someone's way. If there is standing room only dancing is, usually, fine and encouraged! (2) If Sufjan is dancing, so can you! I danced so hard during the Age of Adz tour when he played impossible soul!"
Sufjan,38t9qf,housechore,9,Sun Jun 7 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"I think for this current tour dancing is somewhat inappropriate, especially depending on the venue. I went to the show in LA and it was at a very nice venue, a place that seems like it hosts many more symphonies than rock bands. Sufjan books these places on purpose obviously, and I think that makes his tour more of a 'show' than a concert. I mean it would seem ridiculous to be dancing during a symphony, and it doesn't really fit the vibe of the show.   When I went to the Surfjam Christmas Tour that was a different story. Much more like a concert with a wacky vibe that certainly encouraged dancing and all kinds of shenanigans. So take the the temperature of the room, but if someone next to me started dancing during this tour I would be annoyed."
Sufjan,38t9qf,_runningwithscissors,7,Sat Jun 6 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Age of Adz tour I danced, Christmas tour I danced, Carrie and Lowell I did not dance, its not dance-inspiring music, like at all."
Sufjan,38t9qf,jordie_saenz,-1,Sat Jun 6 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"To be more clear, I'm not talking about full on out of your seat dancing. Just, younknow, bobbing your head. Swaying in rhythm with the music. Stuff like that. Having some physical response to the fact that you're hearing a live performance of songs you supposedly like. Obviously not every song/moment calls for this, but some do, right? For literally everyone else to have been literally absolutely motionless for literally the entire show is weird to me."
Sufjan,38t9qf,deterritorialized,12,Sat Jun 6 19:54:26 2015 UTC,I was mostly trying not to cry in public. Not sure which concert you went to.
Sufjan,38t9qf,ByTheCreed,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:41:12 2015 UTC,same... I've seen Casimir on some set lists from other cities. He didn't play it in LA. I would have lost it. But hearing Carrie and Lowell played basically from beginning to end was harrowing enough.

Sufjan,38s52h,stanley_1914,3,Sat Jun 6 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"I went to the Oakland show last night. Absolutely stunning. Picked up one of the Whale Fail singles at the merch shop. My seats were nose bleeds, which was very frustrating because I bought them the second pre-sale happened. Ended up saying fuck it and sitting on the floor up close, and lucked out by not getting asked to move.   Most of the new songs have a new feel live. Electronic/drums thrown into the mix. Musicianship was perfect. That got REAALLY LOUD AND PLAYED HARD A FEW TIMES which was unexpected but glorious. He talks the the audience during the second act, mostly rambling. Didn't feel like a really concert, more like a dream.   Very jealous of my buddy who saw him on the streets of Oakland a few hours before the show and talked with him for like 15 minutes. I guess Suf was going to Rite-Aid for props. A lot of what they talked about made it into Sufjans ramblings live which was very cool.   GO"
Sufjan,38s52h,fadedseaside,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:00:30 2015 UTC,Love the description that it was more of a dream. His chirstmas show was so fucking good. It is by far the best encore I have ever seen. Glad to hear you had a great time!
Sufjan,38s52h,wumbogumbo,2,Sat Jun 6 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"I saw the C&L tour in Columbus a month or so ago. It was such an incredible show, you will not regret it at all!"
Sufjan,38s52h,pussyonapedestal,2,Sat Jun 6 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"If you have a ticket, absolutely. Incredible show. He's got all of C & L and a variety of selected songs from prior albums. Lighting and set design are mesmerizing and thought-provoking. Go - you won't regret it. (Source: I went last night.)"
Sufjan,38rlgm,pussyonapedestal,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:22:40 2015 UTC,black messiah was such a wonderful album. 100% up there with my favorite albums of 2014
Sufjan,38mkb2,Zoql,9,Fri Jun 5 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just cranky and old, but I've always thought that this was a pretty disrespectful and selfish way to handle this song (from the contest winner, not Sufjan)."
Sufjan,38mkb2,collin2387,4,Fri Jun 5 12:34:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I do understand their desire to make add more romanticism to the song, since I do understand the thrill of the chase, so I wouldn't say disrespectful. I do agree with selfish. Despite holding those listening parties for free, they had to understand that not everyone would have a chance to attend, and even then, those who do go out of their way to ""find"" the song don't get to keep it. They should definitely have made a limited vinyl or something once the listening parties ended, since hunting vinyls is something they referred to in their explanation..."
Sufjan,38mkb2,isitherightword,6,Fri Jun 5 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"the way they handled it was kind of the most obnoxious thing ever. It's old and forgotten to them but there are so many people who would love to hear it. It would have been cool if they did the listening parties for a while and when they were done with it eventually released the song, but now it's probably deleted and lost and forgotten. Lame."
Sufjan,38mkb2,emblapolaris,4,Fri Jun 5 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"About 2 years ago, a month or so before I went to see Planetarium in Brooklyn, I wrote to this guy to try to meet up, but all I got was this automated e-mail.  I never heard anything again. I hope the song surfaces some day!"
Sufjan,38mkb2,shishkabibal,2,Fri Jun 5 05:55:19 2015 UTC,"That's a shame... Well, hopefully they'll do something with it soon. It would be nice if they even allowed it to appear in the next Christmas collection in a few years"
Sufjan,38mkb2,MEK42,3,Fri Jun 5 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a cool idea to have listening parties for the song, but it's been so many years since it was made, and I'm guessing a lot of fans can't afford going to NY just to listen to a song. I doubt he'll ever be traveling to my part of the world. I wish that after so many years he would release the song one way or another. Like make donation to a good cause and get to download the song."
Sufjan,38mkb2,MEK42,6,Fri Jun 5 09:14:18 2015 UTC,I get irrationally mad every time I remember this song exists... It's silly that the song has just been sitting on a hard drive or CD somewhere collecting dust while it is so easy to make a kickstarter to release the song and donate all the money to charity.
Sufjan,38mkb2,ethanwc,2,Fri Jun 5 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that it was an interesting idea, and I definitely understand the thought behind it, but I'm on your side. A lot of fans won't have a chance to listen to this, especially now since the listening parties are on hiatus."
Sufjan,38n1f5,SanDiego_Iam_not,3,Fri Jun 5 07:24:18 2015 UTC,Kind of sucks they over produced them :( I thought I had something rare

Sufjan,38n1f5,smelltheglove-11,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:12:58 2015 UTC,Op posted a similar thread on /r/music and he said that the company over produced them so there no longer just 25 to a show they are just trying to sell as many as they can now
Sufjan,38n1f5,pussyonapedestal,2,Fri Jun 5 16:14:24 2015 UTC,weird. they were still advertising 25 of each color at the 6/03 show. maybe they just didn't want to change the sign.
Sufjan,38n1f5,jordie_saenz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:43:42 2015 UTC,i was at the 6/3 show and i saw tons of copies under the desk where they kept all the vinyls and stuff

Sufjan,38hhtu,pussyonapedestal,9,Thu Jun 4 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"He did play John, only earlier on. The show was absolutely fucking fantastic, I don't really know what to say other than that. Fourth of July and Blue Bucket were simply exceptional, a lot of drone, electronic, and post-rock added onto what I thought would be a purely folk experience. Seriously, post-rock is my favorite genre and the music he did live is up there with Godspeed and Sigur Ros. Absolutely ridiculous.  Really, really wish I booked two tickets, one for tomorrow. Hell, I wish I could follow him on tour. The stories he told in between were surprisingly lighthearted then philosophical, and the extra encore after Blue Bucket was amazing. I'm running out of adjectives here, it was just...well, to put it in perspective this is my first time going to a concert of my own accord. I've been with parents or family, but Sufjan is the first time I went out of my way to by tickets and go. The experience was incomparable, and now I'm just worried that every other concert I go to will suck in comparison!  On a tangential and unimportant side note, at first I was worried about the show because I bought the more expensive tickets without realizing they were on the first balcony (founder's circle or something), and my row was far enough back to where my poor eyesight made it very hard to see. Right before he started I went up to the front row in the balcony, right in the center, and sat in one of five open seats. Within a few minutes the two seats on my left were filled by two guys, and the two on my right were taken up by a few ladies; I had managed to luck out and find a front row center seat that was empty. From there on I got an unobstructed view of the show, as if it was my destiny to see Sufjan in all his glory. Maybe that's a little over the top, but hey, I'm pretty hyped right now."

Sufjan,38hhtu,jordie_saenz,2,Thu Jun 4 08:13:47 2015 UTC,"I got it! The red white and blue pressing. When I first got there, there were like 50-60 people in the merch line and I thought, ""Shit, I'm not gonna get it."" But they ended up still having a bunch!"
Sufjan,38hhtu,penguintheft,2,Thu Jun 4 17:32:51 2015 UTC,I feel like they weren't serious about only 25 per show because I saw a lot of people
Sufjan,38hhtu,FireworksNtsunderes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"There were two different colors, so I think it was 25 of each color? Still, 50 isn't very many."
Sufjan,38hhtu,FireworksNtsunderes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:19:53 2015 UTC,Yeah they must have made a bunch more in time for this show because they were still selling them afterwards

It sucks that you were next to somebody so bothersome, but hey, at least the show was great! Luckily the people I sat next to were perfectly fine, in fact I was probably more annoying. I shift around in my seat a lot and after a while it started squeaking, though at that point I would only move in-between songs so it wasn't as annoying. That, and I kept recording stuff, but I held my phone low and tilted it so the light wasn't in anybodies face."
Sufjan,38hhtu,deterritorialized,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:19:50 2015 UTC,The 7 inch vinyl at the merch stand. They only got 25 per show (so I hear) it's an unreleased song from suf

Unfortunately I had to go pretty much immediately afterwards, so I didn't have any time to stop by the merch stand. Well, that and I may or may not be inept and navigating around and didn't even notice there was a merch stand...  I'm a ""special"" kind of man I guess."
Sufjan,38hhtu,deterritorialized,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:43:43 2015 UTC,Yeah the line was huge I'm surprised they were still there. According to /u/asthmatickitty only 25 are sold per show

I actually bought two by accident (didn't realize it was the same song AND same artwork) so I ended up giving the other to my friend. I'll be sure to let her knkow about the 25 copies part!"
Sufjan,38hhtu,deterritorialized,2,Thu Jun 4 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"I am so happy now to know that there are other Sufjan fans who also like GYBE.  They are up there in my pantheon of favorite bands.  Their show in Athens, GA, right before they started touring Alleluia, Don't Bend, Ascend was the best show that I've ever seen (and I got to see Sufjan on this tour).  That's how good it was.  They didn't speak once during the show...just came out, started making noise that morphed into music with filmstrips playing in the background.  I encourage everyone to see them if they get a chance!"
Sufjan,38hhtu,penguintheft,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are pretty great. I think you might be surprised how many post-rock fans in general like Sufjan, in my experience there is actually a decent overlap.   I'm going to see MONO on the 27th this month, and from what I hear they are LOUD! Looking forward to it. If you haven't listened to them, you totally should. Definitely one of the best post-rock bands from Japan."
Sufjan,38hhtu,Mauri_San,2,Thu Jun 4 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"I saw them a few years ago!  One of the guitarists has this amazing feather tattoo on his strumming arm, and he makes his hand ""fly around"" while he plays.  It's pretty awesome."

Sufjan,38hhtu,penguintheft,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think that you'll have a great time!  They're fun to watch...and I'm sure that they'll play some old tunes as well.  They played both Ashes in the Snow and The Flames Beyond the Cold Mountain at our show."
Sufjan,38hhtu,Pink_Cactus,6,Fri Jun 5 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"The ending of 4th of July was one of the best performances I've seen live. Screaming ""We're all gonna die"" at the audience over the intense build-up of the music was just so...I don't know, it moved me."
Sufjan,38hhtu,Pink_Cactus,2,Thu Jun 4 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"I was so blown away by that ending. But I melted when 4th of July transitioned into No Shade. To have them all screaming ""we're all gonnna die"" for so long with the build up was so intense, and slightly depressing. Then to have the brillians colors of the sunset with just him center stage... so many happy, warm feelings. Brilliant showmanship!"

Sufjan,38ao3y,Peteriffic,3,Wed Jun 3 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"Very much so. You're in for a treat. The setlist is also extremely good. He isn't gonna address the audience for the first hour or so, plays pretty much all of Carrie and Lowell straight through. Most of the songs have been thoroughly remixed for live performance...its breathtaking"
Sufjan,38ao3y,Peteriffic,2,Wed Jun 3 00:25:55 2015 UTC,When he played austin there were some of the classic t-shirts on sale but a new blue t-shirt which I am assuming is the tour t-shirt. They had vinyls of all his stuff too. I didn't see any hats.

Sufjan,380yoc,jakem1000,2,Mon Jun 1 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"Michigan and Seven Swans have always been classic cannabis albums for me. So pure, intimate, beautiful, idealistic. Full of life brushing against life.  Carrie & Lowell, among other things, is a return to that mindset. It's a downer album, for sure, but it's full of subtle moments of intimacy that feel, to me, enhanced by cannabis."
Sufjan,380yoc,Zima-Blue,2,Mon Jun 1 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"Listening to All Delighted People (the song) on MDMA was unbelievable, the music was enveloping and the whole band was in the room. It's one of the strongest experiences I've ever had."

Sufjan,37vs6i,lunarlander,6,Sat May 30 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe ""Seven Swans""? It has this stanza:  We saw the dragon move down My father burned into coal My mother saw it from far She took her purse to the bed"
Sufjan,37vs6i,burningtoad,3,Sat May 30 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is the idea you already had, but the line "" Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us"" from the Seer's Tower might be about Carrie. I wasn't sure if this is to be interpreted literally about his parents or if it's a biblical illusion where his ""mother"" is Eve and his ""father"" is God."
Sufjan,37vs6i,dignitywithdeath,5,Sat May 30 21:16:03 2015 UTC,I feel like it could be either and it could be used to parallel biblical story with his real life.

Sufjan,37weli,lunarlander,1 point,Sun May 31 18:34:49 2015 UTC,Yup.  Their newest album (came out a few days ago) is pretty good too.  Its a lot less interesting than their first  one though but the songs DEATH and Murakami are breath taking.

Sufjan,37v9kt,isitherightword,12,Sat May 30 18:11:10 2015 UTC,"The Grammys are a celebration of the music industry, not music.  You bring up all these artist in the ""indie"" circle, but:  -Beck has been making music for over 20 years, sold millions of copies of his albums, and he's signed Capitol, a subsidiary of UMG.  -Vampire Weekend is signed to XL Recordings, the same label that signed Adele and releases physical Radiohead albums. XL is also a subsidiary of Beggars, one of the biggest UK labels.  -St. Vincent was signed to 4AD, a subsidiary of Beggars, but now she's on Loma Vista. Loma Vista was started up by an ex-Interscope exec and has artists like Damien Marley, Spoon, and Soundgarden.  -Arcade Fire is insanely popular and is signed to Merge, which is possibly the biggest indie label in America. They've also had UMG release their albums internationally.  -Kendrick is signed to Aftermath/Interscope. I have nothing else to say about that.  My point is, all of these artists, who are respected in the in the indie community, are signed to record labels that are part of the machine. Labels that make the big bucks and labels that benefit from the Grammys. Sufjan, as respected as he is, is signed to Asthmatic Kitty, a label he started with his step-father. It's not associated with any of the big boys. It's not a big label, hell, it's not even a mid-sized label. It's the definition of a small, indie label.  Sufjan will never get nominated for a Grammy. Ever."

Sufjan,37v9kt,uggghhhggghhh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of a stretch. 4AD is definitely an ""indie label"" - if you look at their roster they sign people like Twin Shadow, TV on the Radio, Mojave, Beruit etc. XL signs Sigur Ros, FKA Twigs, the XX and Jamie XX, also a truly ""indie label"". When I speak of the mainstream record industry, I'm talking about Interscope, Capitol, Columbia, Atlantic - the companies that own like 95% of the market share. XL, 4AD and the like may be big in our world but they are a dime in a gigantic crater when thinking about the music industry as a whole. But you're right. AKR isn't a dime in the crater, it's like a penny. Or some metaphorically smaller object.   My point was it's kind of a big deal for people who aren't signed to Columbia, RCA, Atlantic, Interscope and the like to get nominated at all and to me that represents a shift. The music industry has really changed and evolved over the past 10 years with piracy and streaming and advancing technology so the rules are changing, and quickly. But again, I don't think it matters if he does or doesn't- I actually this his most accessible work from an awards standpoint was probably Illinoise, but that album was released 10 years ago, and the music industry was a lot different then than it is now- there wasn't as much of a streamline between the mainstream and the ""underground"". But anyways, none of it matters, it doesn't make the album any less or more great it's just something I was thinking about."
Sufjan,37v9kt,lunarlander,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"why not, besides the fact that the grammys almost never recognize people who make real music as opposed to mass production via assembly line? :D"
Sufjan,37v9kt,lunarlander,7,Sat May 30 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"If Sufjan was capable of winning this year Sun Kil Moon - Benji would have won last year, plain and simple.  Sufjan just isn't commercial enough.  He's not on the radio, he doesn't play any musically political games, and I just don't see him fitting into that awards show at all.  They don't give Grammies out due to talent or critical acclaim.    If he was gonna win one wouldn't it have been for Illinois?  Chicago was huge, on the radio, and that album was very much on the radar for a lot of people.  Maybe times have changed but I haven't noticed much change at all in the Grammy's over the last few years.  edit: However I don't wanna come off as super negative or anything. I do hope he's capable of at least being nominated!"
Sufjan,37v9kt,uggghhhggghhh,3,Sat May 30 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"you know I don't know. I feel like St. Vincent's last album was probably her least accessible and if she was going to win for one it would have been for strange mercy, but she won for St. Vincent.  The shift in the music industry has literally been over the past 2-4 years... it's only then that I've seen artists that I listen to kind of crack into that arena. I think it's because the album sales of like, modern vampires of the city are actually comparable to some of the bigger artists because so few people actually buy music anymore, and the especially don't buy commercial bullshit as much. I think that's why we've seen those artists recognized, even without radio airplay. I don't think I've ever heard Bon Iver's self titled, modern vampires of the city, or St. Vincent/St. Vincent, or trouble will find me on the radio but they all managed to win or get nominated somehow, which is why I wonder if that is in the realm of possibility for Carrie and Lowell. Time will tell I guess! Anyway none of that shit matters anyway I was just curious as to what you all thought :)"
Sufjan,37v9kt,uggghhhggghhh,2,Sat May 30 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like St. Vincent's last album was probably her least accessible   I really feel the opposite.  It was poppier, her image became weirder, and it clearly did hit a larger audience because she became pretty mainstream, even I heard Prince Johnny on the radio quite a bit.  I mean she performed on Letterman and other various TV shows.  Its probably her most commercially successful album.  As for Bon Ivor, Skinny Love was absolutely huge, and played on radio.  Now I know that was from his debut and not his s/t but he was still riding the wave of fame from For Emma when his s/t came out.    That being said, yea I mean radio doesn't necessarily have a lot to do with it but commercial success does and St. Vincent has definitely had that.  However I could see Sufjan having that as well.  His newest album is short, sweet, and accessible so who knows.  What gets me is, I almost wish he doesn't get nominated.  Carrie and Lowell is wonderful but its not his best artistic effort in my opinion.  I really wish these award shows were real enough to give notice to other albums that are perhaps less accessible like The Age of Adz or Seven Swans, but they didn't.  Its frustrating that he would just now get noticed for Carrie and Lowell and I also think it gives the wrong impression for Sufjan's work frankly.  Its one of my favorite albums but I really wish another one had gotten more attention.  I certainly hope the recognition he has gotten doesn't shape his work (I doubt it will, Illinois being popular certainly didn't).  Edit: Once again though, just to specify, if these were awards worth caring about, I would love for him to get nominated for Carrie and Lowell.  He deserves it.  However I find the Grammys to be laughable and near insulting honestly."
Sufjan,37v9kt,tajjet,1 point,Sat May 30 21:04:37 2015 UTC,"Good points - though I do disagree with the argument that it isn't his best artistic effort. For me this album is definitely one of his best if not his actual best because it is a short, but powerful synthesis of everything Sufjan is as an artist and the first time he's fully poured his own personal narrative into his work. It kind of feels like a culmination of his career to me... like every album he's done somehow lead to this point.   So with that said, I guess I disagree with the point that if he gets recognized for this, that it's somehow wrong because it's not his best work. I also completely agree, the grammy's are such bullshit and are actually blatantly disrespectful to actual musicians making real music and have been for years. They've always been about the machine and the money and the ""pop radio hits"" but the past few years it seems like things have shifted. Despite the fact that yes, some of the aforementioned artists are signed to ""big labels"" it still matters that they're being recognized at all, which never happened in the past. So I just wonder if Sufjan will get recognized by the Grammys.   Also, Sufjan played Too Much on Jimmy Kimmel in 2010. And he also played Letterman as part of The National's band in like 2009-2010, so I mean he also has played TV shows. I think St. Vincent's s/t has become so commercially successful in response to her win, and also, not to be crass, because she's dating an extremely famous supermodel Cara Delevingne. It's the same story with FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson. People who would have otherwise never known anything about Annie Clark now see her in Marie Claire magazine. (No but seriously the other day I picked up Marie Claire and saw an article about Annie's hair. It was a crazy experience.) I definitely disagree that it's her most accessible. I think Strange Mercy is far more ""accessible"" even to me, a long term fan of hers. I just think that it's her moment right now and she's blowing up for a multitude of reasons that have something, but not everything to do with the record.   I don't think it really matters either way because the award show is a joke and a farce and has historically been a perpetual insult to real musicians making real music. My point is I just feel as if the playing field is leveling out with the way the music industry has shifted with piracy and streaming and the dropping price of a record and all that. It just makes me think. Glad to have such an interesting discussion!"

Sufjan,37i2wc,ByTheCreed,5,Thu May 28 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"I kept on getting 'Chicago' on Pandora and it definitely caught my attention from the first play--I loved that it felt so epic and that the instrumentation was so lush. Little less than a year ago I was in Half-Price Books looking through the used CDs and I saw Illinois and recognized it. I figured it was about time I checked it out. I remember when I brought it to the counter the man checking me out was like, ""Oh! You're getting one of my favorite albums!"" He raved about it and said it means a lot to him because he's from Illinois himself. So I gave it a listen and definitely enjoyed it, figuring I'd check out more of his stuff sometime but never quite getting to it--the songs everyone talks about are all on Illinois after all.   When Carrie & Lowell came out I saw some Tumblr posts about the rave reviews it was getting, I checked out the song samples on Amazon and thought, ""this sounds like a chill album that will be good background music at work."" Yeah, I ended up nearly in tears at my desk the next day. I kept listening to it. I looked up his tour schedule and saw he would be in town in a week. Got (awful, as it was almost sold out) tickets. Scrambled to get more familiar with his other albums to better appreciate the concert setlist. Went to the show. Am here now."

Sufjan,37i2wc,killerpengu,3,Thu May 28 08:01:33 2015 UTC,"These are all so lovely--I guess I should add my own. I had heard of Sufjan before but never actually listened to his music. Recently decided to try listening from the beginning to work my way to the new album. Wound up downloading Adz first (mistakenly haha) and loved it. I was working in the darkroom on a photography project for 5 hours or more a day and would just have the whole thing on repeat. It took me time to place songs with their titles since I couldn't take my phone out & many of those songs are among my favorites. Didn't even realize Impossible Soul was one 25 minute song until much later. Fell into Michigan, Illinois, and all the others after that."

I was looking through the playlist for songs I recognized and suddenly I saw a whole pageful of songs by this dude named Sufjan Stevens (I think it was the entirety of The Age of Adz and Seven Swans). I listened to Age of Adz and Too Much and I did not like them at all, I had no clue why the album deserved to be in the playlist. A couple of months later I came across Chicago on youtube and gave it a listen, cautiously because I already knew I didn't really like Sufjan, but kept an open mind when the sound was so different to what I remembered. Listened to all of Illinois right after and fell in love with Predatory Wasp.  Love The Age of Adz now."

We went to this other kids house, and he was sitting in the bedroom of his parents' McMansion rolling a joint and listening to ""Chicago"".  I didn't smoke at the time, but I just marveled at the ambiance as the entire album continued to play.  That same night, my crush and I finally made out in her room--and on the playlist? Predatory Wasp.  After this day in September 2005, I have loved Sufjan since."
Sufjan,37i2wc,lunarlander,2,Sat May 30 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"When I was a child my brother had Chicago on his MP3 player.  I liked it a lot but as a I grew older I shyed away from Sufjan because I was a bit pretentious and the only impression I had of him was in fact Chicago.  Something about his voice and the harmony just gave me a Bittersweet Symphony vibe that I felt I was above.  It was really foolish of me honestly because, well being pretentious is stupid, but also Sufjan's music has impacted me so much as an adult I can't even imagine what could have been in highschool if I had jumped into his work.  Anyways a couple of years ago I went through a period of music exploration unlike any other portion of my life.  I mean it was constant exploring and I was really pushing my boundaries and comfort zone.  I really wanted to understand why pieces of music were beautiful even if I didn't initially feel they were beautiful.  I one day came across a thread on a music board where they all spoke pretty highly of Sufjan.  It made me remember, ""hey!  I never really gave this guy a shot"".  So I of course tried to listen to Illinois and that didn't really click with me immediately, however I did see it was impressive and definitely very good so I pushed on with his newer work.    When I got to All Delighted People, something made sense.  It was grounded in reality but still had his touch and poetic lyrics.  I listened to that EP obsessively for weeks and eventually moved onto Age of Adz which sucked me in pretty well.  I even enjoyed Michigan and Seven Swans quite a bit!  There was just that one album...  The one everyone praised.  Illinois still didn't click with me for whatever reason.  Eventually though, I had a particular night where a rather  unfortunate event took place in my life.  I really was not doing well and I sure as hell couldn't sleep.  I felt uneasy, afraid, and concerned.  I was listening to some Sufjan, trying to pass time and Seven Swans ended.  My phone starts playing ""Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois"".  It felt so comforting, like a father cradling a child.  I listened to the entire album that night twice, it really helped.  Since then I've really gotten past whatever wall I was previously hitting and I enjoy all of his albums thoroughly (especially Illinois!).  I still use it as an album to comfort myself."

Now I want to re-watch Weeds"
Sufjan,37i2wc,uggghhhggghhh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"I think it was 2005/2006. iTunes had ""That was the worst Christmas ever"" as the free weekly download. I listened to it a few times with mild interest. Then one day it just struck me as being really amazing.  I then proceeded to download everything he had done, and was obsessed with Illinois. I recently have been buying his back catalog on Vinyl."

Sufjan,37cmbb,smallj,9,Tue May 26 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"I can't help but find interpretations of that song that make it entirely about Sufjan and his mother to be pretty strange considering the ""you checked your texts while I masturbated"" line. This article doesn't even acknowledge that at all."
Sufjan,37cmbb,Arqueete,1 point,Tue May 26 23:28:25 2015 UTC,"Though I agree with the constant yielding to the ""mother interpretation"" being strange...  The article speaks of Manelich spending his nights outside Marta's room because she hasn't invited him to the marriage bed. One can imagine Manelich masturbating outside the room while Marta metaphorically ""checks her texts"" (ignores him)."
Sufjan,37cmbb,parishclifton,5,Thu Jun 18 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"Because I'm a creep, I managed to locate a New York-based actor named ""Manelich Minnifee"" on Facebook. No way to know if he's the same person, but this artist is apparently the only Manelich in New York City."
Sufjan,37cmbb,Vladith,4,Fri May 29 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Had posted this in the other thread that got removed, so adding my comment here:  Not only is it a ""head in the sand"" type explanation, it's also pretty shady since they don't present it as a possible (extremely remote) theory but as if it was fact. They also never bothered to explain why he would be saying ""Manelich I feel so used"" if he is Manelich. Occam's Razor anyone?  The contortions some Christians go into to ""explain away"" any gay references in Sufjan's work as just innocent metaphors comes across as desperate and willfully blind. Sometimes a duck is just a duck, even if that duck makes you uncomfortable.  If you have seen his C&L tour (or looked at the many youtube videos of it) Sufjan totally sex'ed up ""All of Me..."" with a downtempo beat and gyrates his hips and dances while he's singing it. Unless he has an Oedipus complex (/s) this song is not about he and Carrie."
Sufjan,37cmbb,danoply,3,Wed May 27 23:51:46 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The article is hogwash.
Sufjan,37cmbb,Vladith,1 point,Fri May 29 15:34:46 2015 UTC,I think at the least it's a valid voice to the conversation.
Sufjan,37cmbb,parishclifton,5,Thu Jun 18 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"Confusion about the nature of “All of Me Wants All of You” has arisen surrounding a mysterious allusion in the first verse: “Manelich, I feel so used.” Some have posited this is a moniker for a distant male lover.  That is just disingenuous. You don't have to be great at reading context clues to know that people see this Manelich fellow as a male lover because of the direct sexual reference in the line before it.  I think the Marta of the Lowlands theory is interesting because the name Manelich seems like it must be a reference, but I don't agree with the article's take on the song."
Sufjan,37cmbb,hrmfll,1 point,Wed May 27 08:48:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this...the Manelich line has been driving me crazy!  And the masturbated line, I believe, is best understood (as most of Sufjan's oeuvre) metaphorically.  Checking texts and masturbation are wastes of time and emotion.  It's relation at a distance...signs of our cold social culture."
Sufjan,37cmbb,deterritorialized,1 point,Wed May 27 00:19:39 2015 UTC,"meh I think the debates about the rightness and wrongness of interpretations of his work are kind of all for naught. He's a trained creative writer so the things he says and does are all totally opened to interpretation, there's really no right or wrong answer. Sufjan actually addressed this way back when:   ""There’s no such thing as a misconception of my music. Someone might read into a song as being aggressive, or really mean, or homoerotic, or sacred, and that reading can be completely different to my intentions. But I don’t think intention has much clout in the creative world. Intention finishes its work once a piece is created. I believe in a very democratic reader-response to art, that everyone has a unique experience and, though they may not always be valuable, or believable, or accurate, they’re all viable."" heres the link to that quote...  Don't get me wrong, I love lyrical discussions, especially of his work because it's just so rich. But I think everyone's thoughts are valid. I thought the article provided an interesting interpretation and perspective that I hadn't heard before. Sufjan is a serious Christian. Anyone who knows his work and has read his interviews knows that, but he's also human being who has sex, does drugs, gets angry, all those things. Anyway my point is no one's wrong, and no one's right either way. Only Sufjan knows what he was talking about specifically."
Sufjan,37cmbb,isitherightword,1 point,Thu May 28 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Sufjan is gay, I am just saying that I hope he is and that he should be my lover. Let's just take quick look at some lyrics:  All For Myself -   We set out once with folded shirts, with hairy chest and well rehearsed   I want it all, I want it all for myself   I'll set it right between your eyes   Your shoulder blades, your running knife   I want it all, I want it all for myself  Improving all the time, I am   Improving as I kiss the hem   I promise I won't be a trouble at all  For I'm okay, I'm in the red   Impressions of the unmade bed   You cradled close to me, close to my ear  We set out once forget our shirts with hairy chests and well   rehearsed   I want it all I want it all for myself  Out in the earth I smell of you   Of bathing boy, amazing you   I want it all, I want it all for myself*  All of Me Wants All of You -   Shall we beat this or celebrate it?  You’re not the one to talk things through  You checked your texts while I masturbated  Manelich, I feel so used  On the sheet I see your horizon  All of me pressed onto you  But in this light you look like Poseidon  I’m just a ghost you walk right through  Futile Devices -  And when I sleep on your couch  I feel very safe  And when you bring the blankets  I cover up my face  I do  Love you  I do  Love you  And I would say I love you  But saying it out loud is hard  So I won't say it at all  And I won't stay very long  But you are life I needed all along  I think of you as my brother  Although that sounds dumb  And words are futile devices  John, My Beloved  Are we to speak, first day of the week  Stumbling words at the bar  Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries  Long island kindness and wine  I’m holding my breath  My tongue on your chest  What can be said of my heart?  If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek  Where there remains but a mark  Beloved my John, so I’ll carry on  The Owl and The Tanager -   And your father called to yell at me  You little boy, you little boy  Found out you cheated me   I ran behind the barn and cut my hands somehow  Blood in the meadowlark  I punched your ears instead  I punched you in the head  You only laughed and laughed and laughed  You said you'd wait for me   Down by Tannery Creek   Far out by the clothesline where we used to kiss behind the sheets  The Predatory Wasp -   North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades  I come out wearing my brother's red hat  There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times  He runs washing his face in his hands  Oh, how I meant to tease him  Oh, how I meant no harm  Touching his back with my hand, I kiss him  I see the wasp on the length of my arm  We were in love, we were in love  Palisades, Palisades  I can wait, I can wait  I can't explain the state that I'm in  The state of my heart, he was my best friend"

Sufjan,36y52m,John_Lawn,2,Sat May 23 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I like Richter's music because his albums in particular have a real sense of coherence to them. Memoryhouse is a good example - there's running motifs, progressions, and the album has a really good flow to it.  That being said, it took me a long time to properly get into him. I'd listened to Memoryhouse a few times, as well as Infra and The Four Seasons Recomposed. It wasn't until I heard his other two albums (The Blue Notebooks and Songs from Before) that his music finally 'clicked' with me. His music takes time to grow on you, so if you don't like it immediately then it's completely understandable."
Sufjan,36y52m,HandyAndy136,3,Sun May 24 06:51:50 2015 UTC,"There's really one biggie as far as I can see, which is Steve Reich, particularly Music for 18 Musicians. You'll note similarities with ""Out of Egypt..."" from Illinois, though Stevens has interpreted and built on Reich in his own way(s).   Edit: I think I might have misinterpreted your question slightly. I would still recommend Music for 18 Musicians, though Steve Reich isn't so much ""modern classical"" as he is modernist. For other modern classical composers, I would check out Eluvium, Stars of the Lid (more drone, but still pretty), and Peter Broderick, though I'm stretching the definition quite a bit."

Sufjan is a huge fan of his fans, that I know. But interacting with strangers is hard for anyone, but I can only imagine it's harder given the material here. My personal advice: don't.   Whatever time and energy you'd spend trying to meet Sufjan, spend it on someone close to you. Go out for a coffee with someone you haven't seen in a while. Take your nephew out to the zoo. Life is short, we're all going to die, don't spend it waiting for a stranger to say hello.

Sufjan,36nzmv,Tgg161,3,Thu May 21 03:31:24 2015 UTC,I guess the only catch about dime is that you need to continue to seed the torrent if you want to keep your member privileges (ie it's a private tracker so maintaining your upload:download ratio is crucial).  converted the show to mp3: http://www.mediafire.com/download/s9sy8p6u6xszowy/2015-05-12+-+Bass+Concert+Hall+-+Austin%2C+TX.zip

Sufjan,36dlk8,JoshuaGreen0011,5,Mon May 18 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think it'll be soon at all. Planetarium will probably be the next big thing we actually see from him, and that could be as late as early-mid next year.   I'm also curious about this post because The BQE is considered to be his New York album by a lot of people, but I don't know what he'd consider it. I also doubt there will be any more 50 states records outright named after a state like Illinois or Michigan again, seeing that Carrie and Lowell and Adz both encapsulate a theme from a state themselves."

Sufjan,367dar,lunarlander,7,Sat May 16 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Looks great! I think there should be something between Adz and C&L though, perhaps regarding intimacy? The albums are surprisingly similar, though not at first or second glance. Also I find it interesting that you had the All Delighted People EP so centralized. That's not a choice I'd have made, though I don't really have any reason against it.  Great work though! these are the kinds of quality posts we need more of!"
Sufjan,367dar,captainth,3,Sun May 17 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I have All Delighted People centralized because it has the folk vibe, it has the introspective song writing and electronic tidbits similar to Age of Adz, it has intimate writing, and his voice isn't as high pitch or controlled on the EP so many people who aren't into his older stuff may still like it.  Its not a super important album but it may be a place to start.  I also may be a bit biased because it the first Sufjan album I fell in love with.    Also yea when I revise it I definitely wanna connect Carrie & Lowell with The Age of Adz.  They're very similar.  Thanks for the feedback!  :)  Edit: I also wanna note, although it may seem central, it really involves listening to a lot of his other stuff before getting to it.  It just happens to be in the middle of the picture."
Sufjan,367dar,Arqueete,2,Sun May 17 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that there is a connection between Adz and C&L but I do feel like ADP being in the middle makes sense too. I went ADP -> Adz because ""Djohariah"" and ""All Delighted People"" sparked my interest in the more long, epic, less conventional songs that are so prominent on Adz, while C&L -> Adz is a pretty big jump on that front."
Sufjan,367dar,sufjanfan,2,Sun May 17 05:21:30 2015 UTC,"Age of Adz and Carrie & Lowell have a lot in common. Both are the result of difficult and painful experiences that led to him having a lot of difficulty with songwriting and productivity, and as a result both albums are a twist in style. In some ways I think that Adz is to paranoia/anxiety as C&L is to depression, but both are incredibly more complex than that.  I also think together they happen to represent his most impressive audio engineering skills. I've never heard another album mixed like Adz and I probably never will. C&L's ambient sections are pretty interesting, but even the more traditional folky sound is more polished."
Sufjan,367dar,Arqueete,3,Sun May 17 06:29:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a newbie to Sufjan's music, having gotten Illinois a little less than a year ago but only having gotten into the rest of his stuff after the release of Carrie & Lowell (I saw him live last month so I basically crammed a ton of his music in my head very quickly in preparation), so this is really interesting to me because I'm sort of in the middle of figuring out this path for myself. So far I've gone Illinois -> Carrie & Lowell -> Michigan -> Seven Swans -> All Delighted People EP -> Age of Adz.  The whole Illinois -> Michigan -> Seven Swans path makes a lot of sense to me--I was actually surprised when I took a better look at his discography and realized that Seven Swans was released after Michigan. Michigan so much feels like a bridge between Seven Swans and Illinois in both content and style.  I also like All Delighted People EP being sort of at the center. Not having gotten through all the major albums yet I was hesitant to grab that one when I did (I went for it just because I fell in love with ""The Owl and the Tanager"") but was really glad I did--it's got such variety and touches on all sorts of different things that Sufjan is good at. However, I'm not sure if I think that ADP is the right place to send someone who flat out doesn't like Illinois... I think you'd want to send them to something really different, like Adz. (I do think the ""can't get into his voice"" bridge between Michigan and ADP is interesting... I did notice a difference in how he approaches songs on ADP vocally compared to a lot of his other stuff. Maybe that's a better reason to go from Illinois to ADP? If you didn't like his voice on Michigan you probably didn't like it on Illinois either, right?)  I also think it's unfortunate that C&L ends up being that deep in the flowchart (though it's my personal favorite so I can't help it). In addition to the Seven Swans connection (though when I heard SS I felt like people were exaggerating the similarities of those two albums, they felt very different to me, probably because SS doesn't have the sort of... I guess haunting quality that C&L has? it feels more grounded in a way--but I went in the opposite direction, so this maybe makes more sense) I wonder if you couldn't send someone to C&L from Illinois for something more intimate or more raw, or to C&L from Michigan for the connection they both have to Sufjan's own upbringing in their content.   Thanks for creating this (and being open to feedback--these are interesting discussions)!"
Sufjan,367dar,izinomics,1 point,Sun May 17 05:16:23 2015 UTC,"You've definitely given me a lot to think about!  I may split the Don't like Illinois arrow and have a ""want more acoustic?"" And ""want lush elecontric?"" So it could go to ADP and Adz.  I'll have to think about it a bit more.  I definitely don't wanna emphasize the electronic part too much though.  Adz is electronic technically but it really leaks through sufjans folky sound pretty prevelantly.   I don't want the term electronic to scare people off.  Its my favorite album and I'd hate to make people avoid it (I don't like electronic music in general so I could see avoiding it if this was emphasized too much).  I'm also still trying to decide on whether Carrie and Lowell should come straight after Illinois.  I do believe the album should be connected to more on the flow chart.  Seven Swans is an album that had to grow on me but at this point I find it incredibly intimate.  However Carrie and Lowell grabbed me immediately so having Carrie and Lowell lead to Seven Swans would probably make more sense.    I've also considered starting with Michigan and having it like split between the folk and the theatrical sound leading to Seven Swans and Illinois.  I remember when I first got into Sufjan I connected with Michigan before Illinois but once again I think that was rare.  Hmm there's a lot to consider.  Thanks for the insightful feedback!"
Sufjan,367dar,Arqueete,2,Sun May 17 05:35:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, I just got into his music like a couple weeks ago and I tried pretty hard not to listen to Carrie & Lowell until I had a couple others under my belt. I wound up going on a weird path, Adz - Michigan - Illinois - Carrie & Lowell and still have to listen to everything else. But I wanted to say that I think it was really nice to not listen to Carrie & Lowell blind, because I felt like I had a much better sense of who he is and how he sees the world to affect my own perception of the album. Anyway, just wanted to mention, I think what you have looks awesome and I have a lot of listening to do :)"
Sufjan,367dar,isitherightword,1 point,Thu May 21 14:47:52 2015 UTC,See that's where I'm coming from as well with not putting Carrie and Lowell first.  I feel like that's the key to a lot of his songs and some of his pain and knowing that first would ruin the experience of not only his other albums but of Carrie and Lowell as well.  I think its much better to connect with Sufjan prior to hearing Carrie and Lowell.  It may be the most accessible but I think its way more powerful later on.    However both of us took the more nontraditional listening route.  When I got into him years ago I started with ADP and Age of Adz because I couldn't get into Illinois yet.  Perhaps this has something to do with it.
Sufjan,367dar,isitherightword,1 point,Thu May 21 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"I agree about being careful not to scare people off Adz. I felt some trepidation about it because I saw so many people talking about how it's so different but... while on first listen it might be surprising I don't think it really is that different. It's still unmistakably Sufjan. (I've only had it for a few days but so far I really like it! I'm listening to it right now.)  I feel like it's taking me time to really appreciate Michigan... With charts like this I think it's really tempting to start people with something that makes it easy to figure out where to send them after that, but there's always that risk that you start them off with something that doesn't grab them enough for them to ever bother moving on to a second album. It's challenging!"
Sufjan,367dar,isitherightword,1 point,Sun May 17 06:42:32 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan for almost 10 years now, so I personally went Illinoise, Seven Swans, Michigan, then the other records as they came. However, I dragged a friend to the Carrie and Lowell show in Indianapolis, someone who really appreciates music (she's a violinist) but hadn't really ever gotten into Sufjan and she really loved the show and subsequently the album. I think Carrie and Lowell can also be another entry point for people who are less into experimental stuff, more into classical, then followed by Illinoise, then Seven Swans, then Michigan, Then All Delighted People, Age of Adz, and The Avalanche. Really cool that you're doing this!"
Sufjan,367dar,signsandwonders,1 point,Sun May 17 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there's good potential for starting with Carrie and Lowell but I do have to question if it should be a back up start.  Most of his music lives within a fantastical world, until you get to Carrie and Lowell and ADP (maybe Seven Swans) so should it be an alternate if you can't get into the theatrical mythical nature of Illinois?  Or should it straight out just be where people start.  Its definitely the album you have to commit to the least due to length and the ease in which you can connect with it.  However its nothing like his other work so I fear if that becomes the expectation then it would lead to disappointment and rejection of further albums.  Maybe I'm overthinking though."
Sufjan,367dar,signsandwonders,2,Sun May 17 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree that Carrie and Lowell is nothing like his other work. What I actually love most about the album is how it draws threads from almost all of his major releases and weaves it into this beautiful, albeit brief, masterpiece. I think it's pretty closely related to seven swans (and michigan) stylistically in terms of fitting in the ""folk genre"" and Illinoise in terms of the quiet complexity of the compositions, though C&L is much quieter. It also relates to age of Adz in terms of his willingness to use synthesized sounds and his divergence away from classical instruments like the violin and the oboe etc. All Delighted People it relates to from a personal narrative standpoint, so I feel like you can go any way with it. To me Carrie and Lowell feels like the centerpiece of his incredible catalogue, like somehow all of his other works were building up to the courage he displayed to release this album. But that's just my opinion! It's up to you!"
Sufjan,367dar,penguintheft,1 point,Mon May 18 04:49:42 2015 UTC,"I just mean aesthetically to a new listener.

Sufjan,367dar,signsandwonders,2,Mon May 18 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"Any feedback would be great!  I thought a lot about this but I'm still unsure if I have it right for someone who's new.  I was really conflicted on which album to start with.  I went a very nontraditional route (All Delighted People sucked me in, then Age of Adz, then his other albums.  It took me a year to fall in love with Illinoise) and I wouldn't recommend that to really anyone."
Sufjan,364l7y,whitekid2000,7,Sat May 16 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"I too would love this! Someone needs to seriously talk with sufjan about releasing a soundboard/high quality version of these songs.

He played predatory wasps!"

Sufjan,364l7y,hiplink,10,Sat May 16 11:42:18 2015 UTC,"Probably not! Can't speak for Sufjan's thoughts on live releases, but live releases don't work for me personally. Even the best ones just sound weird, unless it's one of those releases of a metal band from the early 90s and then it's awesome. Otherwise, I am personally not a fan.  Find a way to get the show if you can. :)"
Sufjan,364l7y,lunarlander,6,Sat May 16 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely respect that but I have to say, I had to miss the concert for this current tour unfortunately due to being sick and listening to the bootleg recording done in Brooklyn was incredible to experience.  The album is completely re-imagined and as a fan who really does care about Sufjan the person just as much as I care for the music, it was a really fulfilling thing to listen to.    I dislike most live recordings but I think it'd be valuable for this tour."
Sufjan,364l7y,isitherightword,1 point,Sat May 16 23:12:31 2015 UTC,"Agree, I think the way he reworked the songs from the album for the live show is really unique and special. Obviously the bootlegs are nothing like the experience but I think because of how well the music is re-arranged and how incredible the show was a professional live recording would be awesome. Oh well. Our unofficial bootleggers out there do a pretty nice job :)"

Sufjan,36484n,Conbomb95,2,Sat May 16 02:11:32 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! Considering that for my own laptop now!
Sufjan,36484n,captainth,2,Sat May 16 08:44:24 2015 UTC,/u/conbomb95 I hope these are good enough to represent the beauty of 'John My Beloved' live. If there are any specific ones you would like let me know. :)

Sufjan,36484n,killerpengu,2,Sat May 16 02:10:26 2015 UTC,Glad you like them! I'm really happy with how they turned out. Thanks for the inspiration!
Sufjan,36484n,killerpengu,1 point,Sat May 16 08:45:57 2015 UTC,These look so nice! The website is confusing me a bit though.. Do I have to pay for these?
Sufjan,36484n,killerpengu,2,Sun May 17 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And nope, it was just the easier place to upload them for me."

Sufjan,360s0t,bonniedi,2,Fri May 15 03:11:53 2015 UTC,This is great!
Sufjan,35wi96,isitherightword,5,Thu May 14 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"sorry guys! I thought I posted it in MP3 form but I guess not! my apologies, thanks /u/nickv93 ! I had meant to post this link (http://www.mediafire.com/download/c55dar5vobs18cv/Sufjan+Stevens%2C+Kings+Theater%2C+Brooklyn+522015.zip) my bad! thanks!"

Sufjan,35tqcv,captainth,7,Wed May 13 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"And, err.. this one is actually part of a pair that I made."
Sufjan,35tqcv,captainth,3,Wed May 13 23:13:38 2015 UTC,You have my full and enthusiastic permission! I'm honored!
Sufjan,35tqcv,bonniedi,3,Wed May 13 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm planning a larger scale Sufjan project for the future, but in the mean time I had to throw this together. It is oddly inspiring to look over and see this. Look alive out there!"
Sufjan,35pq2d,jonnierios,3,Tue May 12 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"It's not available. Kaleo La Belle never released it, and from what I gathered from interviews, it's because Sufjan never wanted it released. The last time there was real talk of it being released was in 2010 around the time Age of Adz was released, but Sufjan directly stated in an interview that it was never intended for public consumption. (https://web.archive.org/web/20110329103920/http://www.ripitup.com.au/article/2558) Subsequently all talks of a definitive release died down, and Sufjan and Kalleo collaborated on the film Beyond This Place which Sufjan scored. So that was that. I don't think it'll ever see the light of day unless it's leaked somehow over the past 9 years."
Sufjan,35pq2d,isitherightword,2,Tue May 12 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"Well that kind sucks, and what about the soundtrack of Beyond this place? are there ""new"" songs in that soundtrack? I only found a song of that soundtrack, any website to stream it?"
Sufjan,35pq2d,isitherightword,2,Tue May 12 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"You can stream beyond this place film on amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009FIMYNE?ie=UTF8&ref=Dvm_us_js_sl_GCATTVB009FIMYNE&tag=gcatvodmov-20) I'm still digging around for the full soundtrack, but I did find the link to one of the songs (http://fuckyeahsufjanstevens.tumblr.com/post/11370578320/raymond-raposa-beyond-this-place-ft-sufjan) And a snippet from the Portland performance when he played it live  (http://youtu.be/2FE5AkHpuK4) If anyone has the full soundtrack please share!"
Sufjan,35pq2d,tolecover,3,Tue May 12 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"As much as I think it'd be a fascinating documentary, I think, out of respect, we should let it stay as this unfinished curiosity until Sufjan changes his mind (if he ever does.)"
Sufjan,35opma,signsandwonders,1 point,Tue May 12 07:08:16 2015 UTC,"Is that the Crystal Ballroom, Portland, OR concert?"
Sufjan,35oa6q,isitherightword,3,Tue May 12 04:11:31 2015 UTC,Awesome. Why is it 500+mb though?
Sufjan,35oa6q,stevenstelfox,1 point,Tue May 12 09:40:26 2015 UTC,FLAC files. Tapers usually prefer lossless audio formats to ensure high sound quality.

Sufjan,35k3xu,signsandwonders,12,Mon May 11 03:18:43 2015 UTC,It's a guitalin!
Sufjan,35k3xu,lachelcrove,6,Mon May 11 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"Whoa, first image result: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Guitalin_lmn-2.jpg   built for Sufjan Stevens"
Sufjan,35k3xu,isitherightword,2,Mon May 11 10:08:11 2015 UTC,yeah it's definitely a guitalin. Mayfield Music Company specifically built one (or a couple) for Sufjan.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitalin  https://www.facebook.com/mayfieldmusiccompany
Sufjan,35k3xu,autowikibot,2,Mon May 11 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"Guitalin:       A guitalin (/ɡɪdʌlɪn/) is a Northern American folk instrument that is a part of the lute family, having four courses of strings. Its fourth course is tuned to an octave while the remaining courses are tuned in unisons. The instrument can be either finger picked or plucked with a plectrum. It was invented in October 1962 by Lyle Mayfield of Greenville, Illinois.    The guitalin is a non-traditional, hybrid folk instrument, as it incorporates features of multiple traditional folk instruments into one. While the original tuning consisted of a G chord in root position, the standard tuning of the guitalin which was adopted is a C chord in second inversion. Another common tuning is a second inversion G chord.

Sufjan,35k3xu,Mayfield_Music_Co,2,Mon May 11 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Hi Everyone! Yes, these are guitalins. Sufjan contacted us in 2013 about having us build him a couple. The instrument was invented by Lyle Mayfield in 1962 as a toy instrument for his 3-year-old son, Layne Mayfield. Lyle is my late grandfather. Audio of both of Sufjan's guitalins can be found on our soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/mayfield-music-company). Thanks for your interest!  We are currently updating our website. The updates should be visible within the first half of June.   Nathan Smith Owner, Mayfield Music Company www.guitalin.com"
Sufjan,35k3xu,deliriousfunkypriest,2,Wed May 27 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"I suspect it is a Mandola, because of the eight strings and the size. It looks a little too big to be a mandolin. It was likely built by Sufjan or one of his friends, since it has such a totally unique shape and style. No brand has come out with an instrument like that."
Sufjan,35k3xu,deliriousfunkypriest,2,Mon May 11 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, nevermind then. Thanks!"
Sufjan,35k3xu,sara520,1 point,Mon May 11 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"ahh the GUITALIN!!!  i did some extensive google research on this one time lol.  fun fact he's the first artist to use it on the album since the 60's!!!  i think it's very cool but he doesn't get asked about it in interviews for some reason.  the only info i ever found was on wikipedia and the company's website.  dawn landes in his band plays it as well.  i see the company that makes them on his instagram tag all the time though, i think they are very excited that he's using it!"
Sufjan,35k3xu,Tcrane91,1 point,Mon May 11 21:34:40 2015 UTC,Looks like a homemade mandolin.
Sufjan,35jy8k,Gooch_Scoop,5,Mon May 11 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"Although I've never been to a Sufjan concert myself, I doubt there'll be a shortage of people in t-shirts (especially Michigan or Illinois merch shirts) and jeans. If you feel a little uncomfortable with this, maybe just wear an overshirt? Basically, I'd say don't dress up too much; Carrie and Lowell is soft-spoken and unpretentious, and I don't think you want to come off as the opposite of that.  Another note: Generally you can wear whatever people on stage are wearing. Sufjan just wears t-shirts on this tour, if I'm recalling the photos correctly. So just do what he does or just wear a casual shirt like a flannel or something."
Sufjan,35jy8k,sunnysidesoviet,1 point,Mon May 11 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"Generally you can wear whatever people on stage are wearing   Interesting point, I never considered it that way. Thank you very much!"
Sufjan,35jy8k,vadid37,1 point,Mon May 11 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"Similar concert hall for the Dallas show and the attire was all over the map.  Most were dressed fairly casual, though."
Sufjan,35jy8k,AceScout,1 point,Mon May 11 05:45:50 2015 UTC,"I've been to 3 Sufjan concerts, 1 of which was Planetarium at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. And that one wasn't much different than the other two. I'd say it was a bell curve of casual->formal. Most people were middle-of-the-road casual. No sweatpants, no suits. But wear whatever you want! Sometimes it's fun to dress up a bit for a night out, sometimes a t-shirt and jeans will be more to your liking. I've noticed that the people that come out to see Sufjan are pretty friendly and polite, no one will shun you for wearing something weird or casual or ultra-formal. I'm seeing him in June and I can't wait! Have fun!"
Sufjan,35jy8k,daybreaker,1 point,Mon May 11 08:02:24 2015 UTC,"The New Orleans show was in a fancy theatre and the crowd was maybe 2/3 plaid shirt and jeans, and the rest was a mix of tshirt and more business casual. Only a few people were really dressed up."
Sufjan,35jy8k,avecsarah,1 point,Mon May 11 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"i think you should consider taking a cue from the fanciness level of the venue - ours (LA) is at the dorothy chandler pavilion - a nice opera and concert hall. i'll think i'll dress more nicely than if it were at a club or bar, but not like full length dress or anything."
Sufjan,35h7tv,Amy_ATL_23,1 point,Sun May 10 09:32:34 2015 UTC,Wow! These are amazing! I wish they were better resolution and centered correctly
Sufjan,35h7tv,captainth,2,Sun May 10 21:05:42 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! My laptop screen is pretty small so they work well for me but I'm very new to the whole photoshop thing so I don't really know what I'm doing. I mainly just eyeballed it to be honest. I'm hoping to make some more in the future so I'll do some research into centring and higher quality. Thanks again!
Sufjan,35h7tv,calfman,2,Sun May 10 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"The resolutions are a little weird but typical resolutions would be 1920x1080, 1280x800, and 1366x768. Also most image editing software like Photoshop or gimp you can drag guides from the ruler to help the spacing and centering. I wouldn't mind using one of these as a background if they were a little cleaner. Where did you get these images? I can send you a project file giving some visualization to the guides if you want."
Sufjan,35h7tv,sunnysidesoviet,1 point,Mon May 11 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! Got most of them from like royalty free image places/stock photos but I took a couple of the photos myself and made them more personal so I didn't upload them, just for home use. That would be fantastic, thanks for the help!"

Sufjan,359gls,isitherightword,3,Fri May 8 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, the post-rock treatment of Blue Bucket was phenomenal. Especially coupled with that light show! Here are a some recordings I've come across:  Philly  Brooklyn (the audio is somewhat blown out during the louder parts but still listenable)  Austin"
Sufjan,359gls,TodayIsMonday,3,Fri May 8 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Carrie and Lowell wasn't originally one of my favorite Suf albums after listening to it. I'm more one for his grander sounding songs. But his twist he put on the songs when live...holy crap. All of the simplistic and raw songs of Carrie and Lowell became lush with soundscapes.   I felt the exact same way after seeing him live last night. Holy cow, it was amazing. I'm now kind of sad that's not the version of Carrie & Lowell that exists :("
Sufjan,359gls,daybreaker,2,Sun May 10 16:25:46 2015 UTC,This song at the Dallas show last night just had me remarking on how grief can make people do some pretty incredible things.
Sufjan,359gls,crak6389,1 point,Mon May 11 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"I lucked out and got to see him twice on this tour -- once in Philly and again in DC.   It was basically the same set list both times, but I had a great time.  I have to be the one dissenting voice here.  I think the Blue Bucket of Gold ending is waaaay too drawn out live.   The chord change is not that interesting, and would have rather spent that 10+ minutes listening to a different/better song.  My wife (a huge sufjan fan) gave me a look during this part of the show like... ok enough already.   I thought it was the only weak spot in an otherwise excellent concert!"
Sufjan,358hw2,JoshuaGreen0011,3,Fri May 8 00:03:56 2015 UTC,Been looking for these for a while. Thanks so much!
Sufjan,358hw2,t2ceyellow11,2,Fri May 8 06:54:18 2015 UTC,"I just got through listening to both of these and honestly both were fantastic all the way through with the exception of 10,000 Roses lol. It's obviously not a Age of Adz or Illinois but they both have more high points than low and there are definitely some heavily Sufjan inspired tracks on especially on No One Like A Nervous Wreck."
Sufjan,356kik,sufjanthrowaway,18,Thu May 7 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"I agree and I think people need to view the venue they're in to set the scene of the concert. You're not in a big pit on the floor surrounded by hundreds of sweaty youth. Most of these are in nice concert halls with seating. You wouldn't see a play or an orchestra at these venues and feel that it's okay to yell things at the stage, so people should treat this the same."
Sufjan,356kik,inkysquares,10,Thu May 7 15:39:46 2015 UTC,"Could not agree more. It seems some members of the audience cannot handle silence, and the awkward feeling mounts up inside them so they have to shout something and try to garner laughter, even if only for themselves. It always feels like childish squawks in my ears. Requests and ""I love you"" shouts get old as well. If you didn't appreciate the man, you would most likely not be in attendance to his performance. No doubt I will hear them again tonight."
Sufjan,356kik,RayovacAA,8,Thu May 7 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"There was one guy yelling ""Predatory Wasp"" at the Philly show too! After the third time, people were literally yelling at him to be quiet. I don't understand how someone could find that acceptable behavior."
Sufjan,356kik,applepirates,6,Thu May 7 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"The recent Boston show was my first time seeing Sufjan and I was super pleasantly surprised at how well behaved the crowd was, as I was worried about this happening. I can't think of any time anybody shouted out anything besides ""WOO!""  It is so rampant at shows by my other favorites (The Decemberists, the Mountain Goats) and I always feel such second hand embarrassment for the performers, who try to handle it as gracefully as possible, and for the people who are so desperate for some kind of attention that they have to interrupt the show.   If an artist specifically asks the audience for requests and then there's a lot of shouting and commotion, that's one thing but in general it's just the worst!"
Sufjan,356kik,kickingtelevision,5,Thu May 7 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"I too was at the Boston show, and couldn't believe how respectful & responsive the crowd was. What an amazing show!"
Sufjan,356kik,applepirates,3,Thu May 7 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"My coworker and I have been absolutely incapable of talking about anything else. We are totally driving other coworkers, who do not care about Sufjan, away."

Sufjan,356kik,sara520,6,Sat May 9 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"people who shout for any song to be played at any show are irritating.  unless you're seeing bruce springsteen most artists don't take random requests.  especially in his shows which to me seem very structured.  like you said, he's not going to be like hey, this random dude asked for it so lets go for it!!!!  predatory wasp is one of my favorite sufjan songs and you couldn't pay me to yell it out like that.  so rude.  but this reminds me of one time when seeing Panda Bear, before the encore people were shouting out songs that he wouldn't play and some guy screamed ""PLAY ALL OF YOUR SONGS!!!"" and panda leaned into the mic and in a monotone voice said, ""okay."""
Sufjan,356kik,knittedfabric,4,Fri May 8 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"You reminded me of seeing Sufjan the first time during Age of Adz. Before his last song in the encore, his said something along the lines of ""I guess we have time for one more"" and some guy yelled ""Impossible Soul Again!"" With how fun that show was, it seemed a bit more appropriate. Even Sufjan laughed."
Sufjan,356kik,Suchalongtimeago,2,Fri May 8 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to Sufjan's Carrie & Lowell show yet. My tickets are for a show in June. However, I attended Sufjan's concert in L.A. during The Age of Adz tour and I remember a girl on the main floor yelling, ""Sufjan, will you marry me?"" When she yelled her ""proposal""  it was completely quiet and the band was in between songs. Sufjan stopped what he was doing (preparations for the next song), got a little closer to the microphone and responded with a blunt, ""no."" After he said no and paused for a moment he said, ""You don't know me. Trust me... you wouldn't want to marry me. I'm cranky, messy, I complain, trust me.... you wouldn't want to marry me, so no, just no."" His response didn't sound mean, it was just an honest response that I think made the overwhelmed fans remember that he's a person too and those statements are odd when yelled to a stranger. It has been a long time since that evening, so my memory may be failing me, but I'm pretty sure that was the point he was trying to get across. After he rejected the girl, a guy who was way up on the balcony yelled, ""...Sufjan, will you marry me?"" Everyone laughed and Sufjan went straight into playing his next song. That was the only yelling that happened at that show besides general cheering at appropriate times. The yelling was somewhat entertaining, but thankfully no one was throwing out requests for songs before the encore. I can see how someone who is not a musician would think to throw out requests. Someone who is not a musician may not think through the preparation and arrangement etc. that takes place, they just enjoy the music."
Sufjan,356kik,Suchalongtimeago,3,Fri May 8 07:03:40 2015 UTC,"We're you in Durham?  It was a great crowd!  He was so into his set for the first hour, I wasn't sure he even knew we were there...  Until he broke out with this amazing 10 minute long speech about life & death.  It was such a moving experience!"
Sufjan,356kik,GU3MS,3,Fri May 8 03:59:52 2015 UTC,Hands down best show I've ever been to.  I wish I could go back...
Sufjan,356kik,crak6389,2,Fri May 8 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"The Durham show was perfect. I wish I could listen this tour live more than just this once. But alas, the circumstances won't ever be the same."
Sufjan,356kik,TodayIsMonday,2,Fri May 8 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"I saw this post before going to the Dallas show last night, and I was ready to be annoyed at the crowd.  However, I must say that the crowd last night was SUPER polite.  Almost to the degree that you would be at an orchestra where applause is held until you are sure there aren't anymore movements to the piece.  The audience was SO QUIET for every song, and there was hardly any yelling/ banter at all, and virtually none until the end.  Didn't hear anyone shouting song requests.  More just stuff like ""thank you!""  ""We love you!""  It was nice.  I was proud of everyone."
Sufjan,356kik,Joelasaur,1 point,Fri May 8 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"yeah yelling for specific songs, especially ones that aren't from the new album, is pretty annoying considering that it requires more than just sufjan to put on the show. There are four other people on stage who have all rehearsed a certain number of songs-- unless this were a solo tour it would be pretty impossible to pull something old or rare or obscure with all four up there.  Comments like ""i love you"" can be amusing but gets old real fast. chill out about shouting and enjoy the show."
Sufjan,356kik,isitherightword,1 point,Fri May 8 19:11:06 2015 UTC,"This seems like a regional problem. When I saw Sufjan in Detroit, it was the most respectable crowd I've ever seen. Absolutely nothing of what op mentions happened there."
Sufjan,356kik,Joelasaur,2,Mon May 11 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"lol I disagree... was also at the detroit show. the Detroit show was where the guy yelled freedom in the MIDDLE of Chicago and essentially completely screwed Sufjan up to the point where he started laughing and couldn't finish the lyrics of the song...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyAieBtqp5s  but anyway agreed, this isn't the environment for the senseless yelling."

Sufjan,356kik,kay2491,1 point,Fri May 8 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"I was there too and the people around me were pretty annoying as well. Talking, laughing and whispering non-stop through all of his songs. I was hoping they'd at least show some respect when Fourth of July was playing but no such luck. It was probably because it was populated mostly by kids from the college right down the street. Phenomenal show regardless, just took away from the experience a little."

Sufjan,356kik,dignitywithdeath,1 point,Fri May 8 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"The crowd in DC was pretty respectful, but there were definitely some weird shouts of 'WE LOVE YOU!!!' Like... let the silence be there between numbers, guys. It's not a participatory show."
Sufjan,356kik,ABACUS2007AC1,1 point,Fri May 8 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"I agree this behavior is rude, but at the show in Albany someone yelled for him to play John Wayne Gacy and he actually played it. Not sure if he was planning to play it or not, but the person who yelled for it was probably pretty happy. As other people said, he did seem uncomfortable when people yelled that they loved him. To me that seems so juvenile, as if we're at a One Direction concert.   There was a really good crowd in Brooklyn and no yelling except for the guy who yelled Subaru which was pretty funny."
Sufjan,356kik,dignitywithdeath,5,Sat May 9 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"JWG has been on most of the set lists. I saw him two nights in a row in Chicago. He played JWG on Friday night. Then on Saturday there was a guy yelling ""John Wayne Gacy!"" after every single song. Instead he substituted in Casimir Pulaski Day for it. It was probably planned, but I like to think he did it just to spite the annoying moron who kept shouting it."

Sufjan,355its,Nyrad,3,Thu May 7 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"People can say what they like about Sufjans music. But no honest person can deny the talent behind it.  Folks who talk negatively about serious subject manner being discussed in song have always confused me.  These are the same people who go on to criticize other songs as being too ""fluffy"".  I think it has less to do with the music itself and a lot  more to do with the over arching worldview of the naysayer. Honesty makes people uncomfortable.  I'm not sure when the popular opinion became that music should not be  challenging. Just spoon feed me an experience that doesn't require effort.  Some  prefer it that way. Whatever anyone thinks of the motives behind Sufjans songwriting ;the content is very relevant.   I just can't imagine how someone could criticize a man mourning the death of his mother just because he shares it publicly.  If he was playing these songs alone in a room would they just bust through the door and go, ""look at ole' sorrowful Sufjan being all sad"". I mean seriously. Death, longing ,love,loss. Together these define the whole of human experience.  It's really hard to write a bad review on that."
Sufjan,355its,fouthreetwowilldo,1 point,Thu May 7 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"I thought the DC concert was amazing. DAR Constitution Hall is an odd sort of venue, but it weirdly worked for a performance of this particular album.   My only complaint is that they should give a warning about the strobes/lights for the final number. I am a bit photosensitive and was NOT expecting the end. I love organized noise a lot, so musically it was amazing. But as things kept going I had to bury my head in my chest and cover my eyes and just hope for it to be over. =("

Sufjan,34w6oq,captainth,9,Tue May 5 19:44:58 2015 UTC,god dammit you guys are making me mad that i'm not close personal pals with an imagined version of sufjan
Sufjan,34w6oq,dalvikcache,2,Tue May 5 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"Kind of offtopic, but I had a dream I was at a Sufjan show last night. He was super depressed and didn't do a very long set, didn't even play anything off Carrie and Lowell. He did however sign a cardboard box with my name on it and wrote a note. We had a chat afterwards and he seemed super ordinary/not a famous artist.  He also did a really stripped down version of ""He woke me up again"". Weird, but cool dream."
Sufjan,34vlow,Tasty_Freeze,5,Mon May 4 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"I hold the view that whilst Carrie and Lowell has traits in line with the 50 states records, in particular Michigan, C&L can't be seen as an expansion of the 50 states project. I think C&L is an album of acceptance, mourning and reflection more than a overview of a state.  However, I think that Sufjan will release records with a far quicker pace than between Illinois, Adz and C&L Between Illinois and Adz, he was hindered by an unknown illness and between Adz and C&L, he had to cope with the death of his Mother.   I wouldn't be surprised if his next album is akin to his 50 states project. Oregon does seem a likely candidate due to the amount of time he spent there as a child. New York could also be a possibility considering how much of his recent adult life has been spent there."
Sufjan,34vlow,hiplink,5,Tue May 5 09:48:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't argue that Michigan or Illinois are really ABOUT their respective states, though. I don't think his ""states project"" was ever really just about the states. He just uses them as a backdrop to discuss the same themes most of his music circulates around: mourning, reflection, love, loss, religion... So in that sense C&L is just as much about Oregon as Michigan is about Michigan. Although on C&L the focus is more sharply on acceptance and loss than his other common themes."
Sufjan,34vlow,uggghhhggghhh,1 point,Wed May 6 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean they were about the states in particular, rather that Sufjan more explicitly used places, people or events as an allegorical device to tell his own story."
Sufjan,34vlow,hiplink,2,Wed May 6 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'd agree that there's less of that on C&L. He uses images of Oregon throughout but it isn't quite enough to call it a ""theme""."
Sufjan,34vlow,uggghhhggghhh,3,Wed May 6 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"For the life of me, I can't remember where I read it, but I read an interview about this album with Sufjan and some other people who worked on producing the album. In that interview, one of non-Sufjan people mentioned that he had to talk Sufjan out of making this an Oregon album and just focusing on making it a personal album (with a ton of Oregon influence). So, I'd say this IS an Oregon album just not called Oregon."
Sufjan,34vlow,collin2387,8,Tue May 5 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's from this interview :) Thomas Bartlett is the name of the guy.   But Carrie & Lowell almost became Oregon until Bartlett talked him out of it. With no criticism implied, he calls Stevens’ state records “complicated misdirection and an architecture by which he could actually write about himself. I asked him to let go of the idea that this was an Oregon record and just allow it to be what it really feels like it is, which is a very, very personal record.”"

Sufjan,34tupq,chris_d_cole,3,Mon May 4 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"i don't have a picture but this is what i remember.  they should have the clear C&L tape and clear vinyl.  also the exploding whale 7"" if you get to the merch table immediately after doors open you should get it, they will have 25 of each color from what i remember.  they also have a variety of other albums, including christmas box sets, CDs of almost every album and then vinyl of a few albums.  my second show i picked up a really nice colored vinyl of seven swans.    they also now have this amazing shirt that says ""sufjam fever"" on it.  i got one of those because it's incredible.    also price wise, the shirts are $25, LPs & CDs vary depending on the album (7 swans was $20), the cassette is $10 and the 7"" is $10.  hope this helps you, it was very difficult for me not to go overboard!!!"
Sufjan,34tupq,sara520,2,Mon May 4 15:31:02 2015 UTC,this is extremely helpful. thank you! I've been wanting seven swans for a while so I'm excited it was there at least on your date!

The songs that came out of this project are truly incredible.   Thanks for the bootleg of it, because there's always a decent chance Sufjan will re-arrange some of the songs in terms of style or instruments. XMas CD #8 had leaked a few years back, and when it was included as part of the second XMas collection, it sounded totally different. And I love having what is basically two totally different version of that album."

I just saw Death Cab for Cutie last night and it was more of a ""we'll throw in some new songs to help sell the album, but get everyone pumped on the classics"" type of show.

Sufjan,34jp3q,Bert306,6,Fri May 1 20:33:01 2015 UTC,No clue! We just use the USPS auto-calculation! Blame it on price of gas? Trade winds? Embargos? We have no clue! Eek!
Sufjan,34jp3q,Luminitha,2,Fri May 1 21:32:09 2015 UTC,This t-shirt is fabulous! Will I be able to buy it online?
Sufjan,34jp3q,John_Lawn,6,Fri May 1 23:42:44 2015 UTC,We hope so! Working on it :)
Sufjan,34jp3q,charrzard,1 point,Sat May 2 09:56:33 2015 UTC,Can someone get one for me!? Pleaaase!?
Sufjan,34ixkb,thatscaleb,4,Fri May 1 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say go ahead and remind people over at /r/sufjanstevens about this. It's so much better to have an involved moderator/ subreddit style/ flair etc. -- thank-you for doing this! I always wondered who was the mysterious creator of /r/sufjan and why it was closed to the public, but now the mystery is solved!"
Sufjan,34ixkb,EeyoreSmore,3,Fri May 1 16:52:58 2015 UTC,Made a post over there for you. I figured it would look better coming from someone other than the creator.
Sufjan,34hgyv,Bert306,3,Fri May 1 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"I saw this last night and this was the moment that solidified in my mind that he's just a really down-to-earth dude. The way he just handled the mistakes and rolled with it, and his subtle, deadpan humour... Really refreshing to see that in a seriously talented artist."
Sufjan,34hgyv,Optiguy42,3,Fri May 1 05:25:34 2015 UTC,I really liked how much he loved Neil Young. It almost felt like he picked Massey hall to play this song.
Sufjan,34ewwu,Luminitha,6,Thu Apr 30 16:06:25 2015 UTC,I want to believe
Sufjan,34ewwu,rohypnotoad,5,Thu Apr 30 16:18:09 2015 UTC,The truth is out there...
Sufjan,34ewwu,JW_Stillwater,3,Thu Apr 30 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"Hey my fanboat has been having some issues, can you come look at it?"
Sufjan,34ewwu,JW_Stillwater,2,Thu Apr 30 19:59:54 2015 UTC,"How close do ya live to Cumberbatch County, Florida?"
Sufjan,34ewwu,simbajam13,3,Thu Apr 30 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, I live IN Cumberbatch County, Florida. Right next to a guy named Eddie Lee Capers."
Sufjan,34ewwu,JW_Stillwater,4,Thu Apr 30 20:22:24 2015 UTC,Ya'll heard a sireen?
Sufjan,34ewwu,JW_Stillwater,4,Thu Apr 30 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"You think this J.W. Stillwater has any relation to Professor Stealwater?  If you haven't, listen to this week's ep."
Sufjan,34ewwu,ScuttlesMcAllister,3,Thu Apr 30 21:36:17 2015 UTC,Grandfessor?
Sufjan,34gyr0,Jibinlee,2,Fri May 1 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"I looked around too, but to no avail. Just didn't want you thinking your post got ignored! Maybe if I have time soon I'll try to work it out."
Sufjan,34gyr0,NotThePancake,2,Fri May 1 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it got ignored since it got upvoted, but it would be awesome if you're able to work it out, thanks."

Sufjan,3487a5,thethermals,5,Wed Apr 29 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"Metrotimes has a blog post with a transcribed version  Here's a copy of it, also:   ""We moved to Romulus for a few years in a little house that my grandpa built that's still there. Then we got tired of the jet fumes. So we moved back to the city. A couple neighborhoods. Then we ended up in the north part of the city, just off of Jefferson on Parker Street, near Indian Village.   My parents — yes, they wanted to live in Indian Village, but couldn't afford it, of course. So we just lived, like, a few roads down, in a little duplex. But they told all their friends they lived in Indian Village.  We moved out of the city when I was 9, and moved up north. But I remember a few things about Detroit — very obscure, kind of abstract and mysterious. I remember Devil's Night, and my dad would stay up late with the dog. We had a Bouvier, which is a Flemish sheep-herding dog. It was genetically engineered to bite anything that moves. So he would stay all night to watch the house during Devil's Night, but then we would sneak out to throw eggs and toilet paper at the neighbor's house.  I remember fishing on the river, but we could never eat them because they were polluted. But we were so hungry that one day my dad said, ""Maybe we will eat them,"" and we did anyway. It was good.  I remember my grandma lived at Pink Flamingo Trailer Court in Farmington Hills. We would visit her, and she always had these glass jars of cinnamon candies, and she only gave us one. But she didn't have good eyesight and I would just stuff every pocket with candies. She had a crazy collection of Cabbage Patch dolls. We weren't allowed to play with them, they were just on display. I was so confused why a woman her age had so many Cabbage Patch dolls.  I remember when they imploded Hudson's. The younger generation probably has no idea what I'm talking about.   I remember when Nancy Kerrigan got the shit beat out of her. I mean, I wasn't there, but that was a big deal.  I remember ""Give us some more of '84."" Do they still say that? Or no? ""Give us less of '84,""probably. In 1984 there were more house burnings on Devil's Night than any other year, I think. I think I read that like two years ago and somehow it stayed with me.  I remember going to the Detroit Zoo with my cousin. My parents took us, and we were so excited that we wandered off on our own and got lost for hours, and had no idea where we were. And instead of going to the security guards, we just collected pop cans. Because even at that age, we somehow believed — because there was a 10-cent deposit, you know, on every pop can — we somehow believed that money would solve all of our problems. Even the problem of being lost. When our parents finally found us, we had two garbage bags full of Faygo and Pepsi pop cans. They were like, ""What's going on here?""  Memory is such a funny thing, though, you know. It's all colored by the imagination. A lot of people ask me, ""Well where did you inherit the imagination for songwriting?"" For a while I thought it was Waldorf School, because I went to Detroit Waldorf School for many years. And for a while I thought it was because my parents did drugs and were hippies and in a cult. And then for a while I thought it was because I didn't start reading until I was like 15 years old. I was kind of an illiterate child, because of Waldorf School. So that cultivated my imagination. I'm not sure why.   Sometimes I think it's just because I'm from here, from Detroit, because I started to think that this is the city of imagination. People talk about it like the city of industry, and you know, automobiles. The city of Motown music. And I hate when people call it, like apocalyptic, and refer to like, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. I think that's bullshit, because I think it's actually more like Dungeons & Dragons, which is a land of fierce imagination where anything is possible. We've got sexy ladies wielding swords and gargoyles coming to life. It's Choose Your Own Adventure here. Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm happy to be back so thanks for having us."""
Sufjan,3487a5,Joelasaur,2,Wed Apr 29 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"I was there to see it! The crowd ate it up (including myself, being from Michigan and all).  Amazing set, although I was disappointed he never played ""Detroit"", because, well you know, reasons."
Sufjan,348u5r,habalushy,3,Wed Apr 29 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"On all tracks, or only some? Some of the tracks on side B were recorded in his hotel room, so you can hear the AC running in the back and other background noise."
Sufjan,348u5r,broken_shins,2,Wed Apr 29 05:54:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely more noticeable on some, and more on side B. Do you know which tracks?"
Sufjan,348u5r,kickingtelevision,2,Wed Apr 29 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross, and one other that I'm not sure of."

Sufjan,3470go,AllanOcelot,2,Wed Apr 29 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"/r/weAreTheMusicMakers - for obvious reasons.  /r/maleFashionAdvice Let's be honest - Sufjan probably run's that sub. Guys got some serious style for a man of 40.  /r/Christianity He knows the bible page for page.  I can think of many more, but it's more of a fun game the more people we have ahaha"

Sufjan,3470go,lunarlander,1 point,Tue May 5 21:19:35 2015 UTC,ooh I like those.   Maybe /upliftingnews?
Sufjan,3470fy,lunarlander,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:21:40 2015 UTC,I'm trying to figure out some good colors to use for it though.  Black and white doesn't really fit the album too well.  For the people wondering what my setup it:   Heres an Archey3 screenshot Login Manager/Lockscreen Manager: SLiM/SLiMLock
Sufjan,3470fy,AllanOcelot,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:22:26 2015 UTC,Just take the pallete from the album?   The colours and the silhouettes contrast beautifully. Minimal design before it was even a thing (in contrast to the beautifully over composed pieces of music aha)
