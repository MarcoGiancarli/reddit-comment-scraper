Every experience I have had with REI so far has been exceptional, which is why I have no qualms about spending my money there, even though sometimes I can find the items cheaper elsewhere.   Also, if you get a pack that is over $200, the membership ($20) pays for itself because you get a 10% dividend back at the end of the year."

CampingGear,3dzcur,freedomweasel,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"Mystery Ranch seems to be exactly what you're looking for. Most packs are not customizable and you really have to be in the store and try it on to see how they fit.  These guys (Dana Gleason - ever heard of Dana Design?) design their packs to fit just about anyone by having the pack as a base model and then the part that actually attaches to your body is sized based on the measurements of your body. Then once you get it there is a small amount of tweaking you can do to get a perfect fit. Also, they build them with materials thicker,and more durable than what I see on the trails these days.  The top loading design combined with a front zipper is something I never thought I'd love but it makes it easy to access anything in your pack without completely unpacking it.  I've never looked at an Osprey, Gregory, or ANY pack with envy after I got my Mystery Ranch.  The only downside is that they are a lb or 2 heavier than other packs.  This seems to be the pack for you.  It's at the top of your price range and 65Liters."

CampingGear,3dzcn8,FeebleOldMan,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"Two people hiking, one with a 65L and one with a 50L you should have plenty of room for most trips (I'm not an ultralight guy so I  would personally probably need a 65L if I was doing 3+ days in cold weather). But for anything less then that, just give her some of the fluffier lighter stuff (clothes, down jackets, etc.), and you take some of the denser stuff (stove, tent poles, etc.), and it shouldn't be too hard to even out the weight. I've always liked having a 50L because it has all the room I need and doesn't allow me to be as sloppy packing as I would probably be if I had an extra 15L. In the end though, I think either will be fine, and it won't make a huge difference whichever you go for."

The main reason I made the upgrade is that I do almost all of my backpacking in areas that require bear cans. My old pack couldn't fit my BV500 at all whereas the Atmos AG 65L can fit it in the sleeping back compartment and I still have plenty of room for the rest of my gear.  I don't think I pack particularly light but could easily fit all of my gear in a 50L if I didn't have to carry a bear can. But that's just me.

CampingGear,3dy6cj,Nobleheart,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"there was a study linking alzheimer's and aluminum cooking pans.   Here's what the Alzheimer's Association has to say about this:   Myth 4: Drinking out of aluminum cans or cooking in aluminum pots and pans can lead to Alzheimer’s disease.  Reality: During the 1960s and 1970s, aluminum emerged as a possible suspect in Alzheimer’s. This suspicion led to concern about exposure to aluminum through everyday sources such as pots and pans, beverage cans, antacids and antiperspirants. Since then, studies have failed to confirm any role for aluminum in causing Alzheimer’s. Experts today focus on other areas of research, and few believe that everyday sources of aluminum pose any threat."
CampingGear,3dy6cj,real_parksnrec,0,Tue Jul 21 12:22:53 2015 UTC,"That's because aluminum cans are lined with BPA and the pots and pans are lined with Teflon, both of which have come under fire recently.

CampingGear,3dy6cj,ConvertsToMetric,2,Tue Jul 21 12:34:10 2015 UTC,"pots and pans are lined with Teflon   So, are you saying aluminum causes Alzheimer's or Teflon?  Personally, I don't use Teflon because A) a good cook doesn't need it. With practice, you can easily fry eggs with stainless steel cookware. B) There are verifiable concerns about nonstick coating gassing out at higher temps.   BTW, walk into just about any restaurant's kitchen and you're probably going to find uncoated aluminum cookware, because it's cheap, durable, and safe to use. That said, if you can find any recent studies that aluminum = Alzheimer's, I'd love to see it.  EDIT: forgot to mention that my personal preference in the kitchen is stainless steel, but only because of its excellent cooking properties."

CampingGear,3dy6cj,211logos,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:29 2015 UTC,Hobo cooking.  Throw your food inside a sealed tin foil package.. throw that to the side of the fire...   Eat.
CampingGear,3dy6cj,runduchess,2,Mon Jul 20 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"A couple here mentioned cans. Maybe OK in olden days, but these days many have linings, and would be a disaster over a fire.  As noted, it's a tradeoff with weight. Aluminum spreads heat around efficiently, as does copper. But can cool quicker too. Obviously cast iron and stainless hold heat longer.  So in part it depends on what you are cooking and how. You might want an aluminum with teflon if you want something that you fry up quick and are constantly attending. OTOH, you might want a cast iron pot for beans you leave on and forget for an hour. Sheesh, you can use an aluminum pie tin if you're quick and careful (think Jiffy Pop). What works for a potato (the foil mentioned below) might not work for soup.  So think about what you wanna cook, your menu, and that may make some of the choices for you."

By all means go ahead and have whatever size fire you want for enjoyment, heating, etc., but when it comes time to cook make a nice little one a little less than your pot bottom in diameter and cook like you would cook at home on your stove.  A couple three rocks and a nice scoop of coals from your I-am-He-man fire will get your water boiling fine and save you a lot of pot scrubbing later, not to mention worrying about what to cook in.

LPT: smear the bottom of the pot/pan with a thin layer of washing up liquid before putting it over the flames. You can then easily wipe of the soot afterwards.
CampingGear,3dy6cj,mmm_migas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"I've had a ~3 (4? FIIK) quart stainless pot with a copper bottom for about 10 years now. I'm sure it was on sale at Fred Meyers or something. It's probably been in a thousand fires. It's warped and dented and twisted and works great.  You're tossing it in a fire. You don't have to deal with uneven heat. Distribute the heat evenly by fucking with the coals or mixing some sand in or whatever it takes to get the temp you want, THEN throw the pot on. If it's not cooking evenly, fuck with the coals some more.  Yea, food sticks sometimes. Just toss the pot in the campfire until that shit all turns to carbon then pour it out. Nature's dishwasher.  I'm sure my pan is thinner than it used to be. Another century of this abuse and I may have to spend another ten bucks on a new one.  Deeper is better - it helps keep some of the ash and shit from finding it's way to your food - but not so deep you can't get in there to flip eggs.  TI is awesome for what it is, but I don't think I'd spend that kind of money unless I was technical climbing or something. Aluminum will melt. No experience with enamel, but I think fire kills it. Cast can break, which is more than mildly inconvenient if eg, you're relying on your pot to make water. Stainless for me...."
CampingGear,3dyubn,gethsolar,6,Mon Jul 20 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"I actually think their line of Flash backpacks are a great value for their cost. They are lightweight, built well, and from my experience well designed. You don't really find any features on them that make them stand out, but you don't find anything missing really. Now, they are designed for a lighter load unlike things like Osprey's  Aether line and some of Gregory's heavier stuff, but you shouldn't find yourself limited unless you insist on bringing cast iron and massive cook kits. In that case get an Aether....or a pack mule."
CampingGear,3dyubn,Gauhl,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"I got the Flash 22 pack during the anniversary sale in May, and it has been an awesome daypack. I recently took it with me on a 2 week Europe trip. While travelling, I stored the Flash 22 in my larger backpack in the laptop compartment, which was no big deal because the Flash 22 is very light. While in country, I used the Flash 22 almost every day for food, books, games, water, etc. It was a comfortable pack when walking an average of about 10 miles each day.  I also got some help at REI in adding shock cord in a criss-cross pattern to the front of my pack. This has been a great addition because I sometimes attach wet clothes or a towel to the front of the pack with the shock cord. The shock cord and cord lock was about $3-$4 at REI."
CampingGear,3dyubn,lngster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:03 2015 UTC,I use the Flash 22 for my day hikes. My friend has a Flash 45 (i think that is the size) and he goes backbacking with that and I would have to say that if someone wanted a very useable backpacking pack I would suggest the Flash 62. Good products in my opinion.
CampingGear,3dyubn,Gauhl,6,Mon Jul 20 20:50:07 2015 UTC,I recently got a pair of REI cork-handle collapsible trekking poles and I'm very happy with them.
CampingGear,3dyubn,Irish33Laidir,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:17 2015 UTC,I got them too and love them. My little brother went with the $25 poles off of amazon and the handles slipped down because the glue didn't hold. They also collapsed constantly on him and were pretty much worthless.
CampingGear,3dyubn,Rand3mhero,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can vouch for these, I find them very comfortable and easier to deal with than my friend's arcteryx poles. The REI brand is slightly heavier but simpler in design, makes them easy to use."

I was very impressed with the weight and ease of setup once I started using it. At first, I thought that REI brand things would be mediocre at best but I was happily surprised to find that most REI brand things are actually pretty good. I have a pair of trekking poles that, in my opinion, are just as good, and in some ways easier to use than my friend's arcteryx poles. I hear great things about the flash backpacks although I have never used one myself."
CampingGear,3dyubn,lukejc1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:23 2015 UTC,I like pretty much every REI branded item I purchased.  I have the Half Dome 2 Plus tent and it is great.  It's easy to set up and take down and takes less than 5 minutes to do either.  I also really like their 1.5 Sleeping Pad.  I slept on one for 10 nights and so impressed I bought another one for my girlfriend.
CampingGear,3dyubn,twynkletoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Is there anything you need? Is there anything you want and haven't found a good enough reason to buy?  Go to their website and check out the reviews for those products.  Pick the one you need or want most.    I've been happy with my pack and with my French press  mug.

CampingGear,3dvs80,RyMiller94,4,Mon Jul 20 03:32:52 2015 UTC,"Osprey, along with most of the industry all kind of settled on 1/4 inch as an industry standard for those valves so that attachments would be cross compatible. Judging by how you said you bladder was just over a year old I'm guessing it's like that. I personally have a camelbak and love it, zero problems. It uses the industry standard.  Edit: Words"
CampingGear,3dvs80,freedomweasel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ya, this is the newer pack. I have an older Osprey bladder that is rock solid and the hose is a bit bigger.  Edit: to be clear it is the new one that broke in a second pack."

CampingGear,3dvs80,dangerousdave2244,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"I have used Camelbak, Geigerrig, Platypus and Source bladders. Out of those, I trust Source the most. Great design allows you to clean the bladders easily, and they're made of a tougher material than the others. Also, Source and Platypus bladders make the water taste the least offensive compared to Geigerrig and Camelbak (which is the worst).  I can't deny Geigerrigs are the most ""fun"" bladders though as you can actually spray the water. It's just that I rather not carry the extra weight from the air pump and tube.  Source also sells a magnetic tube attachment if you require."
CampingGear,3dsiif,WiglyWorm,7,Sun Jul 19 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"I work for a retailer which sells both Thule and Yakima, so maybe take this with a grain of salt. In my role, I handle a significant portion of the used items which get returned, and when they're not in a condition that can be resold, I carry the responsibility of dispatching them into the afterlife. In that role, and in selling & installing them, I say that overall I like Yakima's products better.   Very solid design, reinforced lid, great foot/clamp system, pretty good latch. The dimpled Carbonite texture is aesthetically pleasing. I've had to dismantle many with a crowbar, and boy do they put up a fight. The Skybox or Skybox Pro models are the ones you want... stay away from the Rocketbox. I'm not a fan of their latch.   If you go with a Thule, I'd recommend the Sonic. Good reinforced lid and a solid base, I like their lock-assist knob. I'm not a fan of Thule's crab-claw clamps, as I call them, but they're pretty damn simple to install. I think we sell more of the Force model than any others, and while I like their texture, they're not as robust as the Sonic. Stay away from the Pulse."
CampingGear,3dsiif,crappuccino,2,Sun Jul 19 06:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say OP's best bet is to get new bars and attachments for the car and then to get the actual compartment used on Craigslist."
CampingGear,3dsiif,Readysethorrible,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:13 2015 UTC,"I bought used Yakima stuff and it works great. Got it all off Craigslist. I figured out the size crossbars I needed and then bought some that had been on a different car but used the same towers. Only thing new I bought was the clips specific to my car. Spent $225 for bars, towers, clips, two bike racks, foam crossbar covers for carrying long loads like a kayak, Yakima cargo box and a wind deflector. Took me about 6 months of searching but it paid off in the end. Love the system and I can put a ton of gear in the pod."
CampingGear,3dsiif,Sneezer,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"I see used Yakima stuff on Craigslist all the time, great deals too. Definitely the way to go for as much of it as possible."
CampingGear,3dsiif,WiretapStudios,6,Sun Jul 19 23:13:21 2015 UTC,"We had a bag years ago- not great when wet.  I have a Yakima system  with 4 towers and 2 cross bars.  It is very solid. I also have the basket they make, and I can put storage tubs on it and strap them down with ratchet straps very easily.   I also have an inexpensive (compared to Yakima and Thule) Sears hardshell streamlined cargo carrier that attaches easily to the crossbars. This is better than the tubs and basket as it is larger. I have never had anything get wet in it.  The other thing I have is a trailer hitch rack. It is great for putting a cooler and a tub on. This is probably cheapest and easiest if you have a trailer hitch receiver.   I got this stuff bit by bit because it costs a lot of money to me."
CampingGear,3dsiif,maxillo,2,Sun Jul 19 02:15:34 2015 UTC,"I have a black Sears cargo carrier too, I got it super cheap on Craigslist, stripped off the logo badges (they were only taped on), threw some stickers on, and it looks nearly just like the name brands. I only use it a few times a year, so no need to drop $500 on a box that does the same thing. If I had a lot of money I'd definitely get a skinnier, longer one, but the black Sears one isn't bad at all."

Some rain in on my most recent trip, but it could easily have come from the two brief stops when I had to open it. A hard shell carrier would be better, but the cost/effectiveness ratio is pretty good."
CampingGear,3dsiif,Harmania,2,Sun Jul 19 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Thule --generally more expensive but some products are way better.  Whiperbars and the kayak uprights are 2 examples  Yakima is a bit cheaper but just as good.  They have a better selection and price of boxes.  Ive done a lot with roof racks.  You have to be careful using straps. They work because of compressive force.  If you but them on something weak (like the wrong kind of plastic crate) then they will fail the cargo changes shape and the compression is lost.  Never a need to use the wratchet type.  That amount of force is more than you need and can break whatever youre strapaping unless it is made to take that pressure.  This issue can cause your stuff to break and then fall off the roof at high speed.  No bueno...  Tailgate shelf is real nice for its low loading height it can block access to the cars rear lift gate if you have.  I only use mine if I have too.   You can buy some that swing away but they are expensive.    You should be fine with this car.  I know people who do multi day WW kayak trips out of the smallest scion, kayaks and a whole world of extra gear for 2 people and many many hours of driving.    PS for the most part, you can mix and match Thule/Yakima bars and accessories.  I have a Yakima box on Thule bars right now.  Bike racks tend to be vendor specific, but I prefer bikes on a hitch rack because my car is tall already."

The reason I wanted this type of stove in the first place - was to go 'ultralight' for 3-season trips. I take a different stove if I care about cold weather or gourmet cooking. The Micro Rocket is good at simply boiling water, which for me is all I need. It fits into my Snow Peak 700 pot perfectly with a fuel canister."

CampingGear,3dr2xr,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"Theyre both really similar, the microrocket is only slightly smaller, but I would choose a different stove that distributes its heat better, like the Optimus Crux (I have the crux and love it). The Crux directs its flames not just upward but outward, so if you are cooking on anything bigger than a titanium mug, it'll work a lot better, and is less likely to scorch your pot. On the other hand, the upside of the pocketrocket is that it holds the pot higher, so if you put a cheap aluminum or expensive titanium pot, it might hold it high enough that it won't warp the pot"
CampingGear,3dpm2d,SunriseGear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"I recently took a brand new set of these poles on a hike. It was more of an expedition, really, where everyone had packs of at least 60 pounds, full of electronics equipment. The trail got pretty bad at times and we were mainly slipping down waterfalls and doing a lot of creek crossings. I was pretty leery of how this kind of pole would hold up, but I couldn't have been happier. As I became more exhausted hauling all that weigh on really difficult and slick terrain, I began putting more weight on the poles as I used them to vault from rocks on water crossings. I totally don't suggest doing this, but we had really severe weather closing in on us and were trying to sprint to a safe location. I fully expected them to break and they didn't even bend. I took more and more of my trail frustration out on these poles and they didn't make a peep.  Leki's were the more popular pole choice in the group, and a few people had theirs snap on similar abuse. Not saying that these are stronger or better, but it did quiet the Leki crowd who was making fun of us Z pole people. I thought I'd be bothered more about the fixed height, but I did pretty well hiking both up and down really steep slopes with them. My only complaint is the strap starts to fray on the outside after use, but that seems to be more a cosmetic than structural flaw. The compact size is so small that I've been throwing them in my carry-on for every business trip, just in case I can find a good trail for them. Also, the swift locking move makes you look pretty badass."

CampingGear,3dn4l9,sejose24,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:57 2015 UTC,How do you intend to use this? $100 is a good deal (considering it is $350 retail).       This is however - not a backpacking tent. Killer car camping option for 2 people in 3-season conditions.
CampingGear,3dn4l9,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I plan on doing more backpacking than car camping, but I feel like it wouldn't hurt to grab this at that price."
CampingGear,3dn4l9,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Especially if you don't already have a car camping tent. I personally have a few tents. Ones that are more dedicated for car camping. Where they are roomy and extra durable. Then backpacking ones that are light and packable. It's nice to have dedicated gear for specific adventures (one-size-fits-all doesn't always work).       $100 is a steep discount on a top quality brand, especially if it's this seasons model. Although - not if it meant I had to compromise the budget for the backpacking tent. If this means you have $100 less to spend on a backpacking tent - then it's probably not worth it. Because a top quality backpacking tent (also from Big Agnes for example) would also be $350 retail. If you had to choose the one-size-fits-all option - a backpacking tent is what you need."

This particular model does not have a rear vestibule, only on the front, and it looks like the rear door does not have a mesh window.  Good tent for $100 though. If you can afford this one and a more backpacking tent go for it."

CampingGear,3diwpk,Sneezer,10,Fri Jul 17 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"The three stoves:   * Jetboil Flash (340gr with pot included), $90 ish.   * Kovea Ultralight Titanium (60gr, $30) + Toak ultralight titanium pot (70gr, $25).  * Primus Backpacking stove (200gr, $18).  The experiment: which stove boils the same amount of water (500ml) faster.   The results:  * Primus Backacking stove: 1min, 37sec. * Jetboil: 2min, 4secs * Kovea: 3 min - the stove (in second photo) changed color after only one use. No big deal, but if you are anal, it might be.   PS: bonus ass in photo No. 1.   Edit: I am not saying the Primus is the best stove. It is the fastest for sure. Whether it is the best or not is very subjective: some may consider it very heavy (200gr vs 60gr of the Kovea). It is surely better than the Jetboil if you need to do something other than boiling water, and it is faster than the Jetboil in boiling that water. Which was surprising for me, since boiling water is all the jetboil is supposed to do. Plus, I have no idea how the stoves perform at different altitudes. Perhaps the Primus sucks in the mountains, or in the cold. Not sure. Also: pots do not rest very stable on the Primus, whereas they seem very stable on the Kovea."
CampingGear,3diwpk,eyesontheskydotcom,3,Thu Jul 16 17:17:30 2015 UTC,Titanium like that will always discolor under high heat. I have a titanium cross stand for my evernew alcohol stove and both discolored. It is perfectly normal.   I have been very happy with my alcohol setup.

For longer trips maybe the lightness pays off - but then I've always thought alcohol stoves were the best bet for longer trips.
CampingGear,3diwpk,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"I am not even sure the Kovea would pay off for longer trips. I haven't tested this, but if it takes 33% more time in boiling water, then I would need more fuel in trips longer than 3 days. So you would need to factor in the extra fuel canister.   What is funny is that the Primus was the first backpacking stove I bought. And after a few years, I am finding out that it is probably winning by far in price/quality ratio..."
CampingGear,3diwpk,irkingu,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:52 2015 UTC,Go figure.  I have a friend who dropped 5 dollar on a knockoff of an MSI stove - said it boils fater than the REAL MSI he bought later to replace it after years of service. and weighed only a little more.  I think the camping stove market is just not catching on to the ease/efficiency/quality of chinese manufacturing. It's not the 80's anymore...

CampingGear,3diwpk,irkingu,0,Thu Jul 16 22:03:14 2015 UTC,Next time just use three identical soup cans to level the playing field.
CampingGear,3diwpk,mmm_migas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"The Jetboil ""SOL"" system is pretty good with cold gas. I've tried putting a typical burner (pocketrocket or something) on a pretty cold gas canister and getting a very weak flame, and then putting a jetboil sol on it an getting a much more solid flame. If it's very cold the gas of course goes almost useless, but the sol makes much more of what little there is. So, you have to heat the canister much less (which is a pain to do) to get something out of it with the sol. But yes, it's not really the perfect stove, it's not very good at melting snow f.ex."
CampingGear,3diwpk,mrjowee,5,Fri Jul 17 01:43:57 2015 UTC,I'll never understand why speed is more important than weight.
CampingGear,3diwpk,genericdude999,3,Thu Jul 16 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"Because if the speed is much much slower, you end up spending more fuel. Hence you need an extra gas canister. Hence you are carrying more weight. Plus, when I motocamp weight is not a big issue, whereas space (2 fuel canisters vs one) is."
CampingGear,3diwpk,genericdude999,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:59 2015 UTC,Do they use fuel in the same rate?
CampingGear,3diwpk,figureinplastic,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand the question. If you are asking if they consume the same quantity of fuel to boil water, my answer is ""I don't know"". But my guess would be ""probably not"". But to verify this I would need to check how many times I can boil the same quantity of water on a single gas canister for each stove"
CampingGear,3diwpk,antperspirant,3,Thu Jul 16 21:46:01 2015 UTC,You could also weigh the gas canister before and after a boil. The difference between the two is the amount of fuel the stove uses per boil. (Start weight - End weight) = Weight used.

CampingGear,3diwpk,GonnaFapToThis,2,Fri Jul 17 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to measure the amount of fuel used per boil you could weigh the cans before and after.

CampingGear,3diwpk,YEMPIPER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:54:13 2015 UTC,You understand my question correctly. It's at least thinkable that the slower system spends less fuel or the same amount as the faster one based on other factors.
CampingGear,3diwpk,Foretrekker,2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, you could use an alcohol stove. I've opted to buy one for fuel conservation and availability. In one review the Trail Designs Caldera Cone boiled 2 cups water in about 6 min with 20 ml of denatured alcohol, then continued to boil after 8 min. Sure, it may not be as fast as a gas stove but I think the savings add up when it comes to fuel (and weight)."

CampingGear,3dm5bl,shut_the_fuck_up_don,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"There is no definitive r-value to temperature rating. There are so many variables. I use a neo air Xlite for 3 season camping and have never had a problem. The pad is much more expensive than the one you listed but only 12 oz. I am also a side sleeper and while I'm mostly comfortable, its a bit narrow. My SO uses the REI Flash sleeping pad which is the same r value (3.2), about 4 oz heavier, a half inch wider, and much cheaper. I also find it easier to inflate/deflate. I am not sure where you're located, I'm guessing outside US so I'm not sure if you can get that pad. I'd avoid the pad you listed as you can get foam pads with the same or better r value for less than half the weight and price.

I would definitely size up with the FL and maybe still with the LT, but it will depend on where you fit on the sizing chart, if you're on the bottom of the range I'd stay in that size but if you're almost the next size up go bigger.  From personal experience the only things I have sized up are my Proshell, my synthetic belay jacket and my down parka.

CampingGear,3debej,awion89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"Nalgenes have been the only bottles I use, but that is because I frequently use the measuring on the side for cooking (I am a frequent camper/backpacker).  If you are willing to invest a bit more, I highly recommend Camel Packs.  You can get a custom mini backpack that holds them (good for short hikes/ or adventure races - saved my butt in my first Spartan Race-) or you can just get the ""bladder unit"" and put it in your backpack."
CampingGear,3debej,genericdude999,2,Wed Jul 15 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite, along with this lid (easiest drinking of any of my bottles).  You might want a larger water bottle for hiking in Arizona.  Consider trail runners instead of boots if you're going to be hiking on trails.  Or try a hike with the running shoes in your closet right now, assuming they have good traction in the soles.  Cutting a pound of weight off your feet is like cutting five pounds from your back.  Almost any little day pack will work for day hiking.  Then get the Ten Essentials and that's it.  Ready for hiking.  :)  I use the Falcon Guides to pick my hikes.  Figure out how far you want to drive, look at the dots on the map in the front, then pick a hike from the descriptions."
CampingGear,3debej,mmm_migas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:14:17 2015 UTC,I second this response. A silo water bottle is awesome. I'd also consider getting a Platypus since it can much more compact.
CampingGear,3debej,dangerousdave2244,4,Thu Jul 16 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"The Merrell Moab Ventilator, despite the name, does not breathe well, you'll get VERY hot in it, because it has too much padding in it. It is one of the most popular hiking shoes in the country, but also one of the worst. It has a low-density EVA foam midsole that is more suited for a running shoe, a flimsy foam insole with no support, and way too much thick padding for a non-waterproof shoe. If you want a really good option, check out the Oboz Traverse Low, Treksta Evolution low, or Vasque Inhaler Low. They are supportive, comfortable, tough, and will last forever. The real key is finding one that has the right fit for you, especially in the heel, toebox, and arch, so get fitted by a good outfitter somewhere. Adidas aren't bad, though"
CampingGear,3debej,makinbacon42,3,Wed Jul 15 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm, thanks. Well the Vasque Inhalers are actually on sale as part of the Amazon Prime sale today, so I might pick those up. I wouldn't be able to get them fitted, but I could swap out for different sizes if I needed to."

CampingGear,3debej,makinbacon42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on the shoe. They use different rubber for different shoes. I've found the Sawtooth and Wind River have better grip than the traverse. Just like not all Vibram rubber soles are the same, some are better than others"
CampingGear,3debej,Irish33Laidir,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"Fair call, funnily enough too it was a pair of Traverse Mid's that I had the issue with."
CampingGear,3debej,dangerousdave2244,3,Thu Jul 16 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything u/dangerousdave2244 said. The last few times I've used my ventilators it was to mow the lawn. Given the description, I'd recommend looking into Brooks Cascadia 9 trail runners. My SO did a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail and swapped his boots for the Cascadias because they were the most popular shoe on the trail, and he hasn't looked back.  As far as clothes go, as long as you're avoiding cotton I'd just go with what feels best, and what's on sale. You can get ~$10 polyester shorts and shirts from Wal-mart or Target. Oh, make sure to invest in some non-cotton underwear as well. I don't see the point in getting nylon or polyester shorts if the layer closest to your skin isn't going to wick or breathe.   Maybe also look into Darn Tough socks. They're a bit pricey, $20 per pair, but they have a lifetime warranty. However, given their durability it's unlikely you'll need to worry about replacing them.  For water, given what I know about Arizona, maybe look into a hydration bladder. If you're going on short trips, two bottles in your side pockets may suffice, but on longer hikers, or in very hot weather you'll need a lot of water. There comes a point where a 3L hydration bladder and a powerade bottle or two take up less space than a mountain of water bottles carrying the same amount of water. I use a 100oz insulated Camelbak Unbottle."
CampingGear,3debej,awion89,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"Also for water, I definitely recommend a hydration pack, it helps you drink much more often than a water bottle, and it is easier to carry in a backpack. I have the Osprey 3L one (specifically the Osprey Manta 28 pack, but the hydration bladder can go in most hiking packs or even some bookbags"
CampingGear,3debej,dangerousdave2244,2,Wed Jul 15 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't read dangerousdave2244's post before I responded, but I absolutely agree!  Also, invest in atleast 1 replacement nozzle, they are cheap and much appreciated when they leak!"

CampingGear,3debej,RangerBacksFan,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:22 2015 UTC,"I concur on the water bladder. It keeps your hands free, and you will drink more often. Also, the water will keep cool for longer when inside the pack."

They are lighter than hiking boots and just fine for all the hiking around town.  For clothes I just wear pants and a T-shirt when I go.  Nothing fancy.  Biggest piece of advice I can offer is WATER WATER WATER.  If you think you need 2 gallons for the trip bring at least 4!  Even if you dont need it you may come across someone who ran out and you can help them out a little bit.    Generally I dont hike when it starts getting real hot.  Some folks do, but Im not that big into it that Im gonna get up at 4am to hit the mountain when its only 90.  Ill wait until it starts cooling off and then go hiking whenever I get there."

You will earn 10% dividend back on EVERYTHING you buy from them - so a $200 tent will net you back that $20 off the bat.  Worth mentioning, too, that their once-lifetime guarantee was reduced about a year or two ago to 12 months.  Still a very good return policy - zero quibble, used to death they will still take it back.  So if you hate the tent you buy or, in 11 months you just don't think it fits your needs any longer, take it back for a 100% full refund."
CampingGear,3ddh4a,lingodayz,3,Wed Jul 15 12:22:29 2015 UTC,"A hatchet (personal favourite = gransfors bruks small forest axe) and a folding saw is a good combo to have.  A folding saw is a must have tool out there imo, makes log gathering for fires so much easier. And an axe/large heavy blade for splitting small logs into kindling. Depending on the day and environment, I may occasionally leave my hatchet behind and bring my fallkniven a1 out with my folding saw. Couple questions will also help make your query clearer. How heavy your gear is and how long you're planning on staying out for. Are you planning to do a lot of (hard) hiking? Or primarily set up camp and stay there for a couple days? Does weight matter a lot to you? (Thinking about the ultralights)"
CampingGear,3ddh4a,eggyegg,2,Wed Jul 15 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"I've tried both bringing a hatchet, a folding saw, and the Sven saw. Definitely recommend the Sven saw. Nothing else.   It's pretty lightweight and rock solid when using it. I would say not to bother with a folding saw. With a knife you can break off pieces for extra kindling if you need. I only bring a small folding knife and the Sven saw."
CampingGear,3ddh4a,emmellst,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:31 2015 UTC,A large'ish knife full tang knife. Wood splitting is done by wacking the back of the blade with another log.

CampingGear,3daibj,makederr,4,Tue Jul 14 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"We deal with this issue a lot.  Sounds like your coat is in good condition, it's only ""wetting out""  When a waterproof jacket leaves the factory, it has a waterproof barrier on the backside of the face fabric of the jacket (what is exposed to the rain) and a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) treatment on the face fabric.  The DWR does not make the jacket waterproof, but it allows the exterior face fabric to resist absorbing moisture.  Hence why you see it bead up and roll off.  When the DWR dissapears, the face fabric is no longer water resistant and will absorb water.   The big problem with this is when the face fabric absorbs water, the waterproof ""breathable"" membrane/coating on the inside of your coat now has clogged pores from the water and it won't allow any vapor to escape.  Your nice waterproof breathable jacket is now a waterproof bag and you are sweating inside, soaking the interior of your coat.  To reapply the DWR, you need to was your jacket in the proper detergent. I would recommend NikWax Tech Wash. And then reapply a DWR treatment, available from a variety of manufacturers, I would again recommend NikWax TX Direct.  It's good advice to reapply your DWR pretty regularly.  It will degrade on it's own over time, or wear off pretty quickly if your garment sees a lot of use.  If you see water soaking in to the face fabric, it's a good time to reapply."
CampingGear,3daibj,Sketch3000,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for much for taking the time to respond. Is the tech wash 100% necessary or can I just do a water only wash and then apply the DWR when the jacket is still wet?
CampingGear,3daibj,Sketch3000,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:34 2015 UTC,"The DWR is going to take much better with a truly clean garment free of oils and dirt - water won't remove that.  You can do it without, but it would almost be a waste of the DWR as it won't work as well.  You can use regular detergent, but it needs to be something really mild that also fully rinses away leaving no residue."

CampingGear,3davdc,IWantThatSign,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"I have the Quarter Dome T2+ and really like it. The extra space is nice, and it goes together pretty easy once you figure out the crazy pole structure. I think the 25% off an outlet item is still active through Friday. It is right at your weight limit and you get a bigger tent.  The Marmot Tungsten is also a nice tent. I have the 3p and really like it. I have it primarily for camping with the scouts when backpacking is not involved. The 2p would be right at your weight limit too I think. The space inside is quite nice, and I like the close to vertical walls at the bottom of the tent.  Both tents you can also lighten up a little by upgrading guylines and stakes.  The Marmot does come with a groundcloth which is nice. The guylines are also nicer than the plain black stuff that REI uses. You will need more line and stakes though if you plan to use all the guyouts on the tent.  One I have looked at and hope to buy at some point is the Tarptent Double Rainbow. Lightweight and semi free standing. A little more expensive but it has gotten great reviews and is crazy light compared to all my other tents."
CampingGear,3d7w3l,thenightisnotlight,6,Tue Jul 14 05:07:14 2015 UTC,If you can afford it I would suggest getting an under quilt and then a lightweight bag or top quilt.

CampingGear,3d7w3l,thezoou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:00:19 2015 UTC,Yea I had no idea the first time I slept in my hammock either but I quickly learned. If you are trying to save money you could also use a sleeping pad or make an under quilt. I found that I move too much in my sleep for a pad because I wake up cold next to the pad. I have not made the underquilt but I have seen directions to make one with a military poncho liner and some shock cord.
CampingGear,3d7w3l,nomansslave,3,Tue Jul 14 22:35:55 2015 UTC,Jacks r Better and Enlightened Equipment make good and comparably affordable top/bottom quilts   A closed-cell foam pad like a ridge rest will be better than nothing or an air pad though.
CampingGear,3d7w3l,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:49 2015 UTC,Man those quilts look nice.  Might be slightly out of my price range and maybe overkill for summer? Definitely something to look into for the future though.  I might try a ccf pad first for summer and a fleece blanket and see how that goes.  Anything is better than the padless/blanketless sleep that I got a couple weekend ago.  I swear I just slept because I was so exhausted.  Thanks for taking the time to answer.
CampingGear,3d7w3l,Icharus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"If you're not ready to spend the money on an underquilt, then what you can do in the meantime is a ""pea-pod"" setup, where you have a sleeping bag that has a separate foot zipper/drawstring, open that, and wrap the sleeping bag around the entire hammock. This isn't ideal, but it works. However, you need a sleeping bag that is wide, warm and packable but still has a separate foot pocket. I can only think of 2 examples for this: the Sea to Summit Trek and Traverse series (Trek at $220-280 is less expensive but not as light or packable as the more expensive traverse, but both would work), or if you're only summer camping, maybe the Mountain Hardwear Down Flip"
CampingGear,3d7w3l,Icharus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"What temperatures and conditions? You should have upper and lower insulation, meaning a sleeping bag or a quilt, and a sleeping pad or underquilt. Even a closed-cell pad will help a fair deal underneath ($20 walmart) and is very lightweight. A sleeping bag on top is pretty important but if you're summer camping in California you might get by with a fleece blanket. Fleece because it dries quickly. Search the REI website for sleep systems to inform yourself better."
CampingGear,3d7zaz,wrongcoaster,18,Tue Jul 14 05:41:23 2015 UTC,I'd consider getting two 4 person tents or three 3 person tents. Huge tents are a bit hard to come by and unwieldy. Having multiple smaller tents will give you more flexibility. It can also be hard to find a big enough flat spot for a single large tent.  Is this primarily for car camping or backpacking?
CampingGear,3d7zaz,diy1981,7,Tue Jul 14 06:09:25 2015 UTC,This might be a good idea too to have options for when your kids get older and want some semblance of independence.
CampingGear,3d7zaz,IhaveCatskills,3,Tue Jul 14 11:04:46 2015 UTC,agreed plus the bigger ones are a pain to set up and fold up
CampingGear,3d7zaz,cmon_the_hoops,2,Tue Jul 14 12:26:30 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing but the kids might be a bit young to split up yet (particularly the 7 and 5 year old). I suggested a 2 room tent (adults in one and kids in the other) with awning (for the dogs). Still usable for the kids when they get older and the adults can buy their own tent.
CampingGear,3d7zaz,muddypaws,2,Tue Jul 14 12:34:22 2015 UTC,This is really good advice. Six people and two dogs in one tent sounds like a nightmare.
CampingGear,3d7zaz,diy1981,3,Tue Jul 14 15:00:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't it?  Haha!  Even when we cabin camp I often think ... what were we thinking?!
CampingGear,3d7zaz,cmon_the_hoops,2,Tue Jul 14 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I was wondering how two would work, but not sure my kids are old/experienced enough to be in their own tent yet?  Maybe the older two.  Just car camping for now."
CampingGear,3d7zaz,211logos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:03:34 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the older two in their own tent with a dog? You can put the tents close together so you can talk to each other easily.  If you're just car camping, you can buy heavier/cheaper tents. Should be easy to stay within your budget even with multiple tents. Maybe check Amazon and see what's highly rated.  Maybe something like two of these: http://www.amazon.com/Suisse-Sport-Yosemite-Person-Room/dp/B001UPU40K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1436914277&sr=8-3&keywords=5+person+tent"
CampingGear,3d7zaz,Sneezer,2,Tue Jul 14 22:51:47 2015 UTC,Personally I would go with a tent that has two rooms and an awning for the dogs. Also good when the kids get older and you can buy another one for the two adults.

It's also important that you pack the heavy items towards your upper back. Lighter items can go farther out or underneath. By arranging items that way, it will minimize the back pain since most of the weight will be placed on your hipbelts and not your shoulder straps."

I feel like a 50L pack is the best compromise, but please do spend the time and go to a shop and get it fitted, it makes a whole lot of a difference!"

I'm going to get a new sleeping bag (using a 0degree bag which is about 10L alone) and a smaller pillow (thermalrest compressible is too large) get things down in size.  I might end up opting for the 75L as it looks to be the same size but with side pockets for the extra 10L."

CampingGear,3d7qhr,markjdube,4,Tue Jul 14 04:13:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd split the purchase up and spend $200-300 on two decent pairs. The steel toe is going to kill you on a hike, and the fitting is likely to be different (standing in place vs. hiking)."
CampingGear,3d7qhr,clearingstick,2,Tue Jul 14 06:49:21 2015 UTC,Consider a carbon fiber toe. Lighter than steel. Weight matters a lot to me when I'm hiking long distances.

CampingGear,3d7qhr,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:02:55 2015 UTC,"Work boots in general make terrible hiking boots. If you're going to get only one, I'd probably say get a hiking boot. Are you going to be operating any heavy machinery or doing anything where your foot needs the extra protection of a steel toe (the possibility of heavy objects falling on your foot, etc)? If so, you need a work boot. If youre mostly going to be using shovels and lifting things like waterbars or 50 lb bags of soil, then youll be just fine with a pair of supportive hiking boots, something like   The Oboz Wind River Or Beartooth Vasque Bitterroot HanWag Tatra   Or other hard-toed, full/mostly leather boots, or tough synthetic ones like some of ASOLO's models. The most important thing is to TRY THEM ON first, fit always comes first, especially for a hiking boot, which needs to fit like a glove"
CampingGear,3d7qhr,SometimesIronic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"What are you going to be doing with trial crew? Depending on what you will be doing, you will not need a steel toe. You won't find a steel toe hiding boot because it will tear up your feet. You are probably better off just getting a good hiking boot."
CampingGear,3d7qhr,tiyr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Check danner. Their fire boots are solid and hike well. You don't want protective toe cap for several reasons. And water proof is neither here nor there. Also look at the danner acadia, and super rainforest. I used danner's fireboots the first season of wildland firefighting.   These boots are purpose built to be worked hard and walked/hiked in for mile over many, many days. They are solid, and comfortable but do allow ample time to break in the boot. It is also very important to buy a good set of superfeet or sole inserts, trust me on this one. They should last you several years.  I would recommend White's smoke jumper boot but I think that is over kill for simple trail work. But the point is, pay once for a superb boot, make sure the fit is PERFECT before you leave the store, break them in properly, and care for the leather.   Danner also offers resole and rebuilds for their boots.   Don't cheap out on the foot wear. I knew that when I went to wildland firefighting and I never really suffered like many of my crew mates. I say again... DO NOT CHEAP OUT ON YOUR FOOTWEAR."
CampingGear,3d4zcw,fifthing,4,Mon Jul 13 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"An alternative opinion since that's what you're looking for...  You don't need this. This is rated to 55degrees. For the same warmth you could just sleep in a fleece or jacket (which you're probably bringing anyway just in case the weather turns colder). If you're picnicing, a thick wool blanket will be even warmer. Go into the store a feel what and 55degree sleeping bag feels like, it's a bit of a joke. I've got warmer summer jackets."
CampingGear,3d4jm2,Pewpewchaos,5,Mon Jul 13 13:45:17 2015 UTC,"Far from an expert opinion, but I grew up using an ancient canvas tent that had more than a few holes similar to what you're describing. We never had any problems with it."
CampingGear,3d4jm2,brennon,3,Mon Jul 13 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"I worked at a scout camp for several years with those heavy canvas platform tents.  The only holes we ever worried about were ones you could stick a finger through.  That canvas was very thick and durable, which may not be the same as your tent.  (One 12'x12' tent weighed maybe 50 or so pounds)  It actually did not have any coating - you would season the canvas (soak through and dry completely 3 times) and it would be waterproof forever (barring holes from branches and such).  I wouldn't worry about pinholes, especially if water isn't coming through.  For patching, I would find more of the same canvas material.  if you have a dime-sized hole, cut out two nickel or quarter sized patches, coat one side of each patch with Good aerosol spray glue, let it get tacky, and then put the patches on either side of the hole.  That clear repair tape that gorilla glue makes would probably work as well."
CampingGear,3d4jm2,Bill_the_Guardsman,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:55 2015 UTC,Thank you. So these minor flaws are normal in a brand new tent?
CampingGear,3d4jm2,Bill_the_Guardsman,3,Mon Jul 13 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"Well, in my opinion, the flaws are inherent in a canvas material, not specifically the tent.  I also feel I should stress that my experience is with heavy canvas.  Your tent may be identical to the ones I am familiar with, and if it is, then yes it is normal.  And if like you said, it doesn't leak water, then I wouldn't worry about it.  Imperfections can be found in anything, if you look hard enough."

(public intimacy wasn't our goal, honest dad)  neither of these can be had for 300.00, currently $429.00 but well worth it imo."
CampingGear,3d4kxn,JacobArnold,4,Mon Jul 13 19:30:47 2015 UTC,You don't need the actual tent to be able to keep the water out.  What you want is a good rain-fly or tarp to put over the tent so the water never touches the actual tent surface.
CampingGear,3d4kxn,JacobArnold,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"That ""bad experience"" I mentioned?  There was a rainfly. It was on correctly. The rain was dripping through it."

CampingGear,3d4kxn,mai_Ttag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"It was an older tent. There didn't seem to be any holes or anything. The water was just soaking through the undamaged fabric. Particularly at the points where it was held up by the poles, but also in the plain stretched part."
CampingGear,3d4kxn,freedomweasel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"An older tent that's been sitting in a hot/cold/humid garage may have lost a significant part of its waterproofing, or never been very good in the first place. Newer tents have come a long way in many aspects. I would probably go with a large 4-6 person Coleman and then Scotchgard and seem seal the sh*t out of it. A right-sized footprint and proper rain fly set up will help too."
CampingGear,3d4kxn,makederr,2,Mon Jul 13 21:15:21 2015 UTC,It amazes me how I discovered many of my friends who claimed to go camping a lot put on a rain fly wrong... such as just having the fly lay on top of the tent or having the edges in a position where the rain will drip onto the tents side.
CampingGear,3d4kxn,heyoceanfloor,5,Mon Jul 13 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"If you want a tent that you can literally stand up in, yet can also hold up to storms, wind, and rain, you will be spending a whole lot of money, and it will be nice enough that it's not really suitable for festival use."
CampingGear,3d4kxn,spotdog14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:09:41 2015 UTC,I was going to say this. The kind of tents that hold up to big wind/storms are base camp tents that cost a lot of money. Basically what you want is a screen house with a good rain fly and very good tent stakes.
CampingGear,3d4kxn,Kardolf,3,Tue Jul 14 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"I just got a REI basecamp 4 last night.

CampingGear,3cx1qr,lingodayz,3,Sat Jul 11 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"I looked at the Roo as well, and sat in one before getting my Helinox. The Roo is much bigger, but I felt it was a little less comfortable. I am 6' and about 245lbs - the edge of the seat felt a little too short, and cut into my thighs when I sat in it. The Helinox was far more comfortable.  I have also looked extensively at the knock-offs, plus the REI version. They are most definitely not the same. Helinox uses stronger DAC poles, and the stitching looked better as well. The Helinox is slightly larger in the cut of the seat, and the plastic hubs have strengthening ridges in them, which are also lacking in the copies. As a bigger guy, the Helinox was the best choice, and well worth the asking price. I did get mine much cheaper by biding my time and capitalizing on coupon sales around memorial day.  The one chair I did not get a chance to try was the Travelchair Joey - this is closer in size to the Chair One, and it looked to be larger and possibly more comfortable. I just couldn't find one locally to try out. I really wanted to like the REI Flexlite chair, as it was cheaper. Unfortunately it is rated for a lower weight capacity, has a smaller seat, and just wasn't that comfortable. It also felt far more spindly when I sat in it.  Incidentally I also picked up a Helinox Sunset Chair with some gift cards I had. It is far more comfortable than the regular chair, and I have started using it as my primary camp chair, and use the smaller Chair One when space is at a premium or I want to take it on a hike, etc.  Hammocks are nice, but when camping with a group it is very handy to have a lightweight chair to move to the campfire, etc.   One of the best purchases I have made. Maybe a luxury item for some, but it far increases my enjoyment of camping, especially as I continue to get older and less prone to sitting on the ground, etc.  If the Roo fits you well, then you might consider the Wallaby. Same chair as the Ro but it has armrests."
CampingGear,3cx1qr,Sneezer,2,Sun Jul 12 04:33:26 2015 UTC,The lightest chair I've found is the alight monarch. It's decently comfortable
CampingGear,3cx1qr,torrent7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:36:07 2015 UTC,I saw that as well but it was also the lowest of the chairs. Didn't like the idea of being almost on the ground while sitting in it.
CampingGear,3cx1qr,__helix__,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"I've got the Alight Monarch as well.  Somehow I managed to lose one of the rubber feet on the first trip.  Had to carve up some of my dog's discarded tennis balls so it would not sink into the ground when I pulled the other one off.  I like it.  Sits naturally, with the legs balancing things out.  Sitting, I occasionally wish I had the extra legs - especially getting in or out of it."

CampingGear,3cx1qr,mrjowee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"A hammock is better than a camping chair, as long as there are trees (which there almost always are). It's close to a pound lighter than an actual chair, more comfortable, allows for lounging, and takes up less space. With a tiny bit of DIY it's a lot cheaper as well.   My hammock is also my bed, so I don't need anything extra. It's easy enough to set up that I use it for a chair during longer breaks."

That being said, i prefer a liner/poncho combo over a pack cover.  I use a simple trash compactor bag as the liner.  Cheap, durable and effective.  When the rain starts pouring, on goes the poncho over me and the bag.  This way you have total coverage over the pack.  With just a pack cover i find the back of the bag is still exposed and rain still gets in.  Hope that helps."

CampingGear,3copuu,shoangore,2,Thu Jul 9 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"I've never been backpacking and felt like I needed a table enough to want to carry something over a pound. And if I were car camping somewhere that I wasn't sure would have a picnic table, I'd want something a heck of a lot sturdier than either of those, and something I could set a stove on.  That said, if you're absolutely set on something like those I would definitely go with the cheaper one. I can't possibly imagine the difference being worth $75+, and I wouldn't feel bad about writing off $25 as an experiment if it didn't work out."
CampingGear,3copuu,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"Right, that's my thought as well.

We have limited space in the car so the smaller the table the better."
CampingGear,3copuu,TXN4L1F3,2,Thu Jul 9 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"Its also note worthy that the Helinox is 2 inches wider when unfolded, and 7 inches shorter when folded. Its a tough decision. Good luck"

I have seen it in store and it is pretty nice. I have their chairs and cot and really like them as well.   I found a small camp table/ottoman thing at a garage sale.

CampingGear,3cocxw,cmon_the_hoops,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"I bought a couple. I hang one over my hammock off a bungee on the tarp line, and it dangles about a foot over my chest, angled to my head (it adjusts angle, and the light pulled to the opposite side balances it perfectly). Running it on low is a great constant cool breeze, and keeps the bugs down as well. On high, it creates a kind of cocoon of cold air around your body, with the ""walls"" of the hammock filling like a parachute. It can really knock down even the worst heat (just finished a week of 100 degree days - but cooler nights of course - with one of these, and slept cool as a cucumber).   It takes 2 D batteries. On high, you can run 2 nights for 8 hours each before needing a battery change (won't be dead, but will create a noticeably decreased breeze), and on low you can make it 3-4 days of 8 hours each. I did 6 nights with just one battery change, and it ran all night all 6 days. Highly recommended."

CampingGear,3cgipx,marekkane,3,Tue Jul 7 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"i have the optimus crux and another optimus stove, the vega. i bought these stoves because i liked the burner spread. it has a big surface, and thought it would be good for cooking.  the problem with the optimus stoves is it's fuel control valve. It cant maintain a steady ""low flame."" much so that i can't simmer. i can try to put it into low, and for a few seconds, it'll maintain the flame, then sooner or later, itll increase output, or go out. i think it has something to do with the valve too loose.    i tried contacting katadyn, and they never replied."
CampingGear,3cgipx,jtroyve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's something to watch out for then. I did order it last night, so I'll see how it goes. I don't know what sort of recipes I'll be using at camp, but I suppose it'll be a fun experiment (or frustrating)."
CampingGear,3cgipx,gordani,2,Wed Jul 8 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"I have the optimus crux and love it. I believe the difference in the two is that the lite version doesn't fold down like the optimus crux, making it way more bulky when it comes to storage. I would say just go with the regular optimus crux."
CampingGear,3cgipx,Sketch3000,6,Tue Jul 7 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"This 100%.  The Crux Lite is cheaper, and weighs a little less.  But the folding feature of the Crux is what really makes that stove amazing.  When it's folded up, it fits into the concave bottom of the fuel can and takes up little to no extra space in your kit."
CampingGear,3cgipx,gordani,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"Excellent, that is what I want (folding feature). Thank you!"

CampingGear,3cgipx,KelErudin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"Usually for boiling water, but I have definitely made meals on it without too much hassle. The biggest problem is that a pan is usually much bigger than the fold out arms meaning it won't stay balanced unless you hold it. I would imagine many stoves have that same problem though."
CampingGear,3cgipx,travelinzac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"That's okay, I won't have many things to distract me as I cook. Thanks for the info!"
CampingGear,3cgipx,travelinzac,2,Wed Jul 8 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"I've got the crux and my brother has the lite. I really like the ability to fold the stove over. It makes storing it much easier. Also, I would pass on their pots. I got one when I got my stove and it is so narrow that it feels like most of the heat from the stove misses the pot. It is worthless with my alcohol stove for the same reason.  Look on amazon for a tonks ti pot (I think that's how it's spelled. I'm on my phone atm). My brother just picked one up and it looks as good as my titan for about half the price."
CampingGear,3cgipx,PyjamaRamas,2,Tue Jul 7 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'm liking that more and more. I would much rather that ability than the few ounces of saved weight.   Oddly, the pot and stove set is cheaper on Amazon than the stove on its own, so I'll probably get the set. I can use the pots for a bit until I go for another, and I've bookmarked the Toaks ti pot. I think that's the one you meant, and it looks really nice. Thanks!"

CampingGear,3cgipx,le_blaireau,2,Tue Jul 7 23:34:34 2015 UTC,Definitely get the Crux over the Crux Lite. The ability to fold is well worth the couple of grams. My entire cook kit fits inside my mug thanks to the Crux folding.

Sadly it seemed like it does not have the ability to compress thing very well. I also wish they had added small pieces of fabric to the ends so that it can help repel dirt, water, and bugs from getting in the ends of the bag. If they made it more compressible and make it so the ends were covered I would would really consider picking one up."
CampingGear,3cg6l5,thenextarcher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:23:35 2015 UTC,I watched a video on the first model. The compression got vastly better. I do agree that sewing in two circles on each end as flap doors would be great. I think I'll get one for clothes in my pack. I'm not sure if she really dug into compressing it. I'd love to test one.

CampingGear,3chdev,PyjamaRamas,2,Tue Jul 7 22:37:47 2015 UTC,"Why a NeoAir at all? I had the NeoAir trekker and liked it, but MUCH prefer my current pad, the Nemo Cosmo Insulated, which is thicker and warmer than the NeoAir All Season. The Big Agnes QCORE SL is a good option too. More packable and inflates thicker. The NeoAir All Season DOES come with a nice pump now"
CampingGear,3chdev,dangerousdave2244,2,Wed Jul 8 05:08:37 2015 UTC,Weight mainly and based on these reviews basically: http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Sleeping-Pad-Reviews  Yeah I can take or leave the pump.... probably take it.  But wouldn't swing me to the purchase :)
CampingGear,3chdev,dangerousdave2244,0,Wed Jul 8 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"The selection they reviewed is very limited. Are you going to camp in the winter? Also, are you camping with others or solo, because the XLite and XTherm are VERY lound, theyre like laying on aluminum foil and tissue paper. I much prefer the material of the Venture and All Season. I agree with their review about the downsides of the Big Agnes QCore, its why I got a NeoAir, then a Nemo. But I would definitely consider Nemo, and if weight is your chief concern, look at Sea To Summit's new pads, they are extremely light and packable, and comfy."
CampingGear,3chdev,KarlHungus_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:11:46 2015 UTC,"I've slept on a Neo XLite and it wasn't that loud at all really.  Once you've got your sleeping bag over it, the noise isn't anything to worry about.  Thanks, I might look at these new ones from Sea to Summit as they do rectangular one."
CampingGear,3chdev,Freddiedie1,2,Fri Jul 10 00:43:14 2015 UTC,"I recently bought an Xlite, but returned it for a Trekker (I know you're asking about the all season, but the all season is just a trekker pretty much with a much higher R value). For me, the rectangular width makes a giant difference, and a few extra ounces really won't kill me.  I'm sure the All Season is a bit noisier since (I think) it has the Mylar later that the Xlite has and the trekker doesn't, but honestly the noise difference was too, too much b/w my trekker and Xlite.  Lastly, the Trekker and All season both have a 70d bottom, while the Xlite is only 30d. Since these are inflatables, I want my pad's bottom fabric to be as strong as possible.  TLDR; as long as you're not super ultralight or like sleeping on tapered pads, get the All Season (or trekker!)."
CampingGear,3chdev,crappuccino,2,Fri Jul 10 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"I purchased the XLite about a month ago, and so far I've been on one 10 day trip, where I slept on it 7 nights (other nights I slept in a hotel.) I found it unbelievably comfortable. I sleep in every position - on my back, on both sides, and even my front sometimes. I use a quilt and the XLite, and it's great!  Granted, once I'm asleep, I don't move much, so the width isn't a huge issue. It is a bit narrow (I got the regular), but not enough to be a huge issue to me. And the fact that it's so light and compact makes this super comfortable pad even better!"
CampingGear,3chdev,Nobleheart,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:04:37 2015 UTC,"The Xlite is ""mummy"" shaped, while the AllSeason is rectangular. While the Xlite in size large is 25"" at its widest point, it definitely tapers at the head and foot, while the AllSeason will be that width all the way down.   I don't have nor have used either, but I do have and love the Xtherm. Bought it in regular size a few years back, but wish I'd bought it in large, for the extra width. Turns out I toss & turn a bit, so having that extra room would be killer. I recommend going a bit big, especially when buying something that is otherwise quite light."
CampingGear,3chdev,crappuccino,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"I really wish they did a regular wide for the Xtherm. The large is the right width, but is significantly longer."
CampingGear,3chdev,crappuccino,2,Wed Jul 8 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"Right. This year they did introduce the Xtherm MAX, which is a rectangular version of the pad, available in regular and large.. being rectangular in shape, it is technically a fuller space for sleeping on, though no longer or wider in dimension than the mummy cuts of regular and large. I'm not a fan of Big Agnes pads, but at least some of those come in wide sizes. Pretty sure some ExPeds do, too. Ah well.   I've actually considered picking up the Xtherm Max in large, and partly justified it by saying that well, especially when I'm snow camping, I deserve to be comfortable AND warm, so I may as well carry something that's just a half pound heavier. But holy cow, buying that thing just once was painful enough!"
CampingGear,3chdev,crappuccino,2,Wed Jul 8 02:08:14 2015 UTC,There's also the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Trekker to choose from:  http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Sleeping-Pad-Reviews/Therm-a-Rest-NeoAir-Trekker  Same rectangular shape.  I wasn't aware of the Xtherm Max - My concern with the XTherm is they'd actually make me too warm.  I won't be camping in any snowy conditions or anything under 0C (30F).
CampingGear,3chdev,travelinzac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"Naw, if you have no intention of using it on snow / in winter, the Xtherm is completely unnecessary. If you do, however, it's pretty boss. I've long-considered picking up the Xlite in large for summer and shoulder season use, as it'd be lighter than the Trekker."
CampingGear,3chdev,travelinzac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, that looks incredible in that cave.  Little bit dangerous if it collapses, but cozy none the less.  I'm going to test out the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite a little more and see if it serves me OK."

CampingGear,3ceplc,PyjamaRamas,11,Tue Jul 7 09:37:04 2015 UTC,"The quilt is lighter, it fits better when draped over you, and puts more insulation on top of you so it's more efficient for the weight.  They also pack into a smaller volume in most cases."
CampingGear,3ceplc,pto892,17,Tue Jul 7 12:10:18 2015 UTC,The main reason people use quilts is because they're lighter. That's pretty much it.
CampingGear,3ceplc,KestrelLowing,5,Tue Jul 7 10:10:48 2015 UTC,"Quilts are lighter because they dont have any insulation under you (which makes sense since it all gets compressed anyway). I like the idea behind quilts and am considering getting one, especially the NEMO quilts that will attach to my 2 Nemo Cosmo insulated air mats that my gf and I use.  That being said, I currently use the Sea to Summit TKII in spring and fall (and cold summer nights), because it is a roomy mummy bag that can unzip completely and be used as a 2-person quilt. In the winter is use a Marmot Never Summer 0 Deg Bag, or if I'm with my gf, I zip the Never Summer and TKII together, and have her sleep in the warmer bag, and her body heat keeps me in my 20 deg bag from being too cold.  The big benefits of my traditional sleeping bag setup are:   it's modular, I can have the 2 bags zipped together or apart, and use the TKII as a one-person mummy bag or a 2-person quilt more versatile: I have used my TKII as a peapod in my hammock, where the insulation on the bottom came on handy, and I can use it for 1 or 2 people   The downside is of course weight. The TKII is 2 lbs, the Never summer is heavier. There ARE lighter weight bags by Sea to Summit and Marmot, I just didnt want to spend nearly twice as much to save one pound"
CampingGear,3ceplc,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, very helpful, I've also been seriously considering that bag.  Which sleeping pad are you using, is it wide?  I tried the method with my girlfriends Thermarest Neoair Xlite which is 25"" wide, but it's mummy shaped.  The advantages in terms of comfort of the quilt method seem to be limited by the width of the pad."
CampingGear,3ceplc,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:22 2015 UTC,"I use a wide pad, the Nemo Cosmo Insulated Large (rectangular, 3.5"" thick), most of the time, but also have a thermarest ProLite Plus regular for backpacking in my smaller 2-person tent, the Big Agnes Fly Creek, which can't fit 2 wide pads"
CampingGear,3ceplc,WoodsAreHome,2,Tue Jul 7 23:11:04 2015 UTC,"I use an EE Enigma quilt, and really like it. The basic idea is that on a sleeping bag, the insulation that is crushed underneath you, isn't really doing anything, so why carry it. Same with carrying the zipper. The EE quilts have straps that go around your sleeping mat, and the quilt clips onto them. With a little adjustment, there is no draft.   I have taken my 20 degree Enigma quilt down to about 26 degrees F, and was comfortable with a wool base layer and thick socks."
CampingGear,3ceplc,scfoothills,2,Tue Jul 7 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Before I switched from a sleeping bag to a quilt, I did exactly this to see if I would be comfortable sleeping in a quilt. I unzipped the sleeping bag and gave it a 1/4 turn before sleeping with it, keeping my feet in the footbox. Once I realized that I was still comfortable and warm, I swapped out the bag for a topquilt & underquilt. Dropping the underside of the bag, hood, and zippers saves a considerable amount of weight. A second benefit, especially for hammock campers, is that it is much easier getting in and out."
CampingGear,3ceplc,scfoothills,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:55:58 2015 UTC,How do you mean top quilt and underquilt?  I'm guessing topquilt is something like the EE Revelation?
CampingGear,3ceplc,frozenthoughts,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I could use a pad in my hammock, but use an underquilt instead. The underquilt connects to the outside of the hammock so the down doesn't get compressed. For me, no point in having a sleeping bag because the down between me and the hammock would just get compressed and be ineffective. My quilts are from Hammock Gear. I think if you're a ground sleeper, you may want extra features like straps on the side and maybe a little more width to keep drafts out. Not sure about that though. Listen to other ground sleepers over me on that."
CampingGear,3ceplc,frozenthoughts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:56:26 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks!  Never done the hammock sleeping and don't think I'm going to be able to for my planned trips, maybe in the future though.  I've a friend that climbs 60M trees and sets up shop in a hammock!"
CampingGear,3ceplc,SideMountRestriction,2,Tue Jul 7 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a newly converted sleeping bag to quilt camper. I do sleep in a hammock but occasionally will do my tent as well. On top of everything that was mentioned as far as being lighter/more compact/etc. I like the ability to have a foot box when it's colder switch to blanket mode. I have a revelation 40 degree as well. The quality of EE is outstanding, no down leakage yet (had it on 3 weekend backpacking trips so far) the material is smooth and comfortable on my skin. They also give you sleeping pad straps that clip to the quilt and wrap around the pad to keep it in place, so you can roll around.  The only downside is sometimes in colder weather you will need to sleep with a hat on; i just use the buff I already bring with me."
CampingGear,3ceplc,Apathetic247,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, good info, do the straps go over you, or do they just attach to the side of the quilt?"

Sleeping together is the best way to keep warm. But if you're sleeping apart, then look into Nemo's women-specific bags, which are great, and shaped better for women. The synthetic and down options both come in 0 degree versions. They also make 2-person quilts.   Also, what is she sleeping ON?

It's probably a little too large for me but I have back issues so sleeping comfortably is my biggest concern. If your girlfriend is very small, the Lost Ranger will probably be way too big for her. Perhaps the BA Roxy or Ethel would work? (I know your budget is ~$200 and they are over but you might be able to catch a sale. I got my Lost Ranger for ~$200.)

CampingGear,3cbhd1,evolvedhumanbean,18,Mon Jul 6 16:46:12 2015 UTC,Go to REI or another reputable dealer and get fitted. This is the single most important thing you can do.   I prefer Osprey packs because they are bulletproof and have an unlimited lifetime transferrable warranty. That means that even if you buy a used Osprey pack you still get the warranty. If you're short on cash you can get fitted for a pack then buy a used version from Ebay for cheap and get all the same benefits of the new pack.
CampingGear,3cbhd1,Nobleheart,3,Mon Jul 6 17:02:18 2015 UTC,Seriously? I've never heard of a transferable warranty like that. I'll definitely look into a used one!
CampingGear,3cbhd1,Nobleheart,3,Mon Jul 6 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"They call it the All Mighty Guarantee. I've never needed to use it, but I think that is a great perk of Osprey packs vs similarly priced competitors."
CampingGear,3cbhd1,seanomenon,3,Mon Jul 6 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"So they have a great guarantee that they conveniently never have to fulfill because their gear never breaks? What a scam!  (I joke, I joke.)"
CampingGear,3cbhd1,shuddertostink,2,Tue Jul 7 11:32:54 2015 UTC,"/r/geartrade.  But as /u/nobleheart said, get fitted first. This is incredibly important.  Also beware that Osprey doesn't make a huge number of adjustable packs, so try to know what model you want before you get fitted in it."
CampingGear,3cbhd1,dangerousdave2244,2,Mon Jul 6 17:53:49 2015 UTC,"Many reputable outdoor gear companies have a transferable warranty: Mountain Hardwear, Arcteryx, Gregory, Osprey, Eagle Creek, and ones that don't make packs, like Gore Tex, Thermarest, and many others. Its why it's worth it to spend extra, these companies stand behind their products. Even North Face and Patagonia have really good warranties"
CampingGear,3cbhd1,rainypassrepair,4,Mon Jul 6 17:38:29 2015 UTC,"This is not always true. My company handles warranty repairs for some of the above companies (not Osprey) and the warranty usually only applies to the original owner. I've heard good things about the Osprey Guarantee, but sometimes there is a long wait for repairs. TNF and Patagonia have great warranty policies, and buying from REI is always a good idea because they can usually help you out if there are any problems with your gear."
CampingGear,3cbhd1,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Other than TNF and Patagonia, which ones are original owner only? I'm pretty sure at least Arcteryx, Eagle Creek and Mountain Hardwear are transferable"
CampingGear,3cbhd1,rainypassrepair,3,Mon Jul 6 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Arcteryx and Gore-Tex are not transferable, unless there is special circumstances, such as someone giving you a new product as a gift or it is for your job. Part of the reason is that there is a lot of counterfeit gear out there, especially on eBay. We see TNF counterfeits pretty often, and knockoffs of high end brands such as Arcteryx, Mammut, etc. Some of these impostors are very convincing, so it is hard for companies to stand behind something that might be a fake when it wasn't purchased at an authorized dealer. Also keep in mind that most companies do not offer warranty coverage for items bought at outlets."
CampingGear,3cbhd1,DfizzleShizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"I swear by Osprey as well. Their packs are by far the best I've ever used. I have absolutely beat the fuck out of my two packs, and they don't have a single hole or flaw at all, even after the constant abuse. I love having a bag that I know isn't going to give out on me, even if I throw it on sharp lava rock that is basically like glass, or when crawling through a narrow space without taking my pack off. It's really relieving to just not have to worry. And their guarantee makes it even better because I know if something ever does happen that I'll be covered."

CampingGear,3cbhd1,foulmouthangel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"The Teton is a great starter pack IMO. It's a little on the heavy side and some things, like the velcro torso length adjustment- aren't the best (the velcro tends to come undone a lot with a heavy load or wet weather), but if you aren't going far, don't go out a lot, or can't afford a fancy ass pack- they're pretty decent. My kids rarely go out with us, but they both have the Scout 3400."

CampingGear,3cbhd1,foulmouthangel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:09:43 2015 UTC,You probably could find a way to melt it or glue it. And don't overstuff the side zipper pockets or you'll pop the zippers. Those are really about the only issues I remember offhand. The fabric itself and the main compartment can take some abuse.

CampingGear,3cbhd1,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"There's good advice in here; in particular, pay attention to the brand names. Look up and find the other good brand names of backpacks. I did that, then signed up for the Sierra Trading Post sales by email. They'll send you a ridiculous amount of them - like 3 a day - and they vary from 35% to 90% off sales. Stick with the 35% to 50% off ones - the higher percentage off usually doesn't include much.   Find some packs you like in their backpacking section. Put them in your shopping cart on the computer you use regularly. When you get a STP email, click on the link to go through to the store, then look at your cart. The sale price of the packs will show up. When you see a good price on one, buy it (especially if it's one you've tried on at a store).   Me? I took a chance and got a Gregory Savant 58 sight-unseen, based on the Gregory name, and figuring if it didn't fit me well I could send it back. Fortunately, it feels wonderful on me, and I got it for like $97 (regularly $150, at minimum).   Hope that helps."

Overall, I'd recommend a lightweight stainless option like the MSR Alpine Stowaway, or a Titanium option by MSR or SnowPeak. Don't use aluminum and DEFINITELY don't use anything with Teflon (non-stick, though some new ceramic nonstick options are ok, they aren't meant for camping).

Problem I run into is most of the backpacking stoves suck at simmering and burn too hot. One of the reasons I keep my old Coleman single burner stoves as they simmer great, they just weigh 10x more than an ultralight stove and iso canister.

Just about every one I have seen has had problems in the rain. Either they allow water to pool, or they leak through the seams as none of them seem to be seam sealed from the factory.  I also have a 13x9 Coleman one that is super light weight, and goes up really quick. Needs to be staked down pretty well if there is any hint of wind though, but it works great to shade a camp kitchen when I set up for a multi day scout camp.  I buy all my canopies on clearance.

If you want it to last a long time, go with the one that has a thicker floor and use a footprint on rocky ground. Remember that all tents start to breakdown and get sticky as the PU coating gets old, so no tent lasts forever.  Also, you sure you need a 3 person? I use this for 2 people and a dog.

A solution to keep things dry.    Fold over top dry bags.  Or a couple of these.  Get lids.   Any kind of pro-tips.   Don't forget a sleeping pad.  At least get this if nothing else.  I don't think you need a fancy Thermarest.  For car camping I like a lantern not a flashlight or headlamp.  Lets you move around in your camp without bumping into things or shining your headlamp in everyone's eyes.  I'm trying to plan a trip (backpacking) this week, but the forecast calls for rain, rain, and also some rain.  You might need some kind of rain gear.  Bug spray is important, but if you have long sleeves you can roll down and some light pants, you will appreciate having this to keep the damned things from buzzing around your ears.  This is my favorite style of outdoor hat.  Better sun protection than a baseball cap, and won't blow off your head like a broad brim hat.  Camp chair.  You need it.  You might need your own dinnerware even if meals are provided.  Much better than a crap aluminum ""mess kit"".  Light enough to use for backpacking later if you want.  If you fill a couple gallon ziplocs and freeze them solid a couple of days before your trip, they will last much longer in your cooler than ice cubes.  Combine both for best results.  If you fill one of these with clean water and set it on a cooler or rock, you have running water in camp.  Amazingly useful."

Remember that when you're reading reviews: a dissatisfied customer is more likely to review a product than a happily content customer. The latter group are out enjoying their tent. The former are at home without what they've deemed a functioning tent.  The best way to deal with this conundrum? Buy your tent at REI - even if it's a littlemore expensive there than other websites. Go camping. Play hard. Push the limits. You've got a year from purchase to test that tent, and return it if something goes poorly.   If you're spending $200, and haven't already done so - join the REI membership. It's $20 for a lifetime membership and you get 5% back from your purchases for the rest of your life. If you join, you won't even need your receipt as they keep that record for you. Set yourself a google reminder for 11 months from date of purchase: ""Still loving this tent?""

CampingGear,3c7twq,etneiewak,3,Sun Jul 5 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"if you're freezing, you should look into a more insulated bag - a decent sleeping bag shouldn't leave you cold from sleeping on your side."
CampingGear,3c7twq,munrobag,3,Mon Jul 6 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"Side sleeper here. First of all, it seems like you're making the sleeping bag turn with you when you turn on your side? You should keep the bag flat and turn inside it.   Also, you should always have an insulated pad or mattress under you, something with a good R-value (at least 3, I usually use one with an R value of 5). A regular air mattress is better than nothing, but has no insulation to it, so you'll be almost as cold as if you were on the ground, and no sleeping bag insulation can make up for lacking an insulated camping mat. (Even cowboys carried a bedroll, same concept) Thermarest, Nemo, Big Agnes and Sea to Summit all make great sleeping mattresses, though you can even go for something as basic as a thermarest Z-Rest.  As for good sleeping bags, I have a few recommendations. The first are the hourglass-shaped, women's specific Nemo sleeping bags, the Celeste and Rhapsody.  Another great one is the Sea to Summit TKII  And any women's specific Mountain Hardwear bag will be good too, just not as roomy as the above options.   http://www.nemoequipment.com/shop/sleeping-bags/"
CampingGear,3c7twq,dangerousdave2244,3,Mon Jul 6 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"and a lot of bags that I've looked or used are less insulated on the back side   Not sure I understand what you mean by ""back side""; you mean the bottom?  Doesn't matter how much down is in the bag, however you sleep (back, side, front), the down you lie on will be compressed and lose all of its insulating properties.    If you're referring to the side where the zippers typically are, then you can always sleep on your other side, or buy a bag with a better draft collar along the full length of the zipper.  I bought my wife a really nice 15ºF bag from Rab, their Neutrino.  Women's bags are shorter and tend to be a little narrower to minimize free space - any excess room in your bag will take longer to warm up (producing cold spots)."

CampingGear,3c7twq,OH58Bitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:33:12 2015 UTC,They are like a mummy bag without the bottom or zipper. They are filled with down. Mine has a short foot box that zips closed or open.

As far as water bottles go, just use the 1L/2L plastic bottles you buy from the store. No need to buy Nalgene or anything expensive, just treat the bottles with respect and you shouldn't break them.

Clearly you didn't understand my point; I'll be specific:  DWR coated anything will wear through normal use.  Most rain jackets (even the expensive Patagonia line) goes with the ""breathable"" DWR coating.  Truth me told, anything coated with DWR will wear down. Don't invest in a tent with DWR.  Waterproof and breathable just don't coexist. It's a marketing ploy.   Further, if you take some time to do a little homework on the silnylon tents -- such as the Lunar Solo -- you will see that they choose a ripstop nylon material impregnated with a silicone blend, giving it a hydrostatic head rating of 1000mm or better with some manufacturers."

There ARE tents made out of waterproof-breathable fabrics (which are NOT just a marketing ploy, the difference is literally measurable), but they are expensive and are made for mountaineering, and double-walled tents work better because there can be way more moisture transfer through the open space between a rainfly and mesh than through PTFE."

CampingGear,3c3s52,shut_the_fuck_up_don,3,Sat Jul 4 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Are there cuben fiber tents that aren't crazy expensive? From what I've seen so far implies that cuben fiber is some sort of composite of gold, diamonds, and unobtainium."
CampingGear,3c3s52,GreatBigJerk,2,Sun Jul 5 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, there aren't. The reason for this is that cuben fiber is only made by a single company, and usually running in demand. However, a considerably larger textile manufacturer (Dyneema) recently bought up the small company that makes cuben. The effects of this buyout may lower costs in the next few years (fingers crossed)."
CampingGear,3c3s52,GPSBach,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:33:21 2015 UTC,What is it?
CampingGear,3c3s52,Dinosaur-Junior,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:53:06 2015 UTC,"Any reason why? Have you used cuben tents? Did you find it held water more than traditional fabrics? Did you notice any problems with it in general? How was the abrasion resistance? Do you think the weight savings is worth paying at least 4 times as much? I can see it being practical for a tarp, but for a free standing or semi-freestanding tent, I think some of its limitations (difficulty with seam sealing, limited mfgs. using it, difficulty to work with, etc.) may come more into play.   Also, what's the real weight savings? Let's take the fly creek UL2 platinum (listed trail weight of 1lb 9oz) compared to the same tent if it were made in cuben, what kind of weight reduction would you expect?"

CampingGear,3c2kqq,thezoou,3,Sat Jul 4 04:16:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you can swing it, get the underquilt.  The comfort and convenience far surpasses the simple pea pod setup I used at first.  However, anything works!   Biggest downside to the diy pea pod is that you can't get a very good diagonal lay in it.  Got to string it real tight so your body isn't in a ""U"" shape.    Consider a diy UQ if funds aren't there yet?  Search on hammock forums or YouTube for instructions.  There are some real simple ones out there.  Use an old bag, or pick one up off of gear trade once you figure out what you want to do (some will use a rectangular bag, for example).  Good luck, and save for the UQ if at all possible."
CampingGear,3c2kqq,IH8DwnvoteComplainrs,3,Sat Jul 4 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the whole reason I hammock camp is to be as comfortable as possible. A peapod, while cheap, is bulky in the pack and severely restricts the way you lay in your hammock; plus its heavy to boot. Ounces in the morning, pounds at night. My whole philosophy when buying gear, much to the grief of my bank account, is to buy once cry once. So, if you can afford it or afford it in the future pull the trigger on a quality DOWN quilt from EE or other brand, you'll be glad you did in the long run. If you think about it, the initial investment in a quality bag is painful but then you'll have a piece of kit that will last you many, many years of happy hanging if properly looked after. Just my two cents because I too am looking to buy a down UQ after dealing with a cheap foam pad for far too long. Good luck and check out Arrowhead Equipment for some more options on synthetic quilts if you still want to go that route."
CampingGear,3c2b3z,Klashus,5,Sat Jul 4 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for EMS, but at REI we carry the separate hip belts and chest straps for the Aether packs. For example, if, for length, you wear a size large, you could buy the pack in large & swap out the large chest straps & hip belt for size XL straps & belt."
CampingGear,3c2b3z,crappuccino,2,Sat Jul 4 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"Osprey packs have three different sizings, the back length (generally referred to as the pack size) the hipbelt size and the shoulder strap size. The advantage of this is your back length won't change if you lose weight but you can buy smaller waist belts and shoulder straps to fit.  IMO the chick you spoke to didn't sound like she had a clue at all since all these parts are interchangeable and any good retailer should have spares on hand as well as multiple sizes to try."
CampingGear,3c2b3z,makinbacon42,2,Sat Jul 4 14:44:21 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks.   Good to know I can get smaller straps later.   Should have went with the bearded dude for help in stead of booty shorts girl haha.

CampingGear,3c2b3z,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:57:30 2015 UTC,I asked her if the sizes meant different strap lengths ect.  she said no it was a height thing from your waist to your neck or something.  She put on the sizer and told me xl.  The one i tried was a medium i believe.   From peoples responses it seems like my initial thought was correct and there are different sizes of the straps and such.  Thanks.
CampingGear,3c2b3z,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"The person helping you was wrong. I work for a small local outfitter, and we get different sized hipbelts for the Aether, and they can be swapped out. The Atmos AG of course is one size, but the hip belt extends"
CampingGear,3c2b3z,5000miles2boston,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"Do you happen to know the specific sizes of what you tried on? The Aether comes in four different sizes, and can be ordered with different sized harness and hipbelt, if necessary, for a good fit. If you're not sure or if the person fitting you didn't mention it, then you may have just been trying a size too small for you.  Scroll down about halfway on this page to see the Aether sizing."
CampingGear,3c2b3z,Lakestang,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:58:31 2015 UTC,I asked the girl there what the sizes meant thinking that xl would make for bigger straps ect.   The one i tried was a medium i believe but she said the sizes were just for the height from your waist to one of your vertebrae.  She measured me and said i was an xl.
CampingGear,3c2b3z,dangerousdave2244,2,Sat Jul 4 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what the size of the pack means, but it also means that you were most likely trying the medium sized belt and harness, too. You can get the different parts sized to fit you properly, but it sounds like you were just trying a pack that was all around too small for you. Why she would size you as an XL and then have you try a medium is beyond me."
CampingGear,3c2b3z,stonewall55,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:46:19 2015 UTC,she didn't have me try a medium that was just the only one there and it was stuffed so i decided to try it on to see what it felt like.   After the belt didn't fit i asked about the sizes.  She said the only thing that changed for the size was the back measurement.  She just didn't know i believe and thats why i made the post.  When I order one i'll go with the xl.  I could get the medium around me with a Tshirt but it wouldn't have worked with a jacket or something.  A bigger size should work well.  Thanks for the help.
CampingGear,3c2b3z,anytimeyoulike,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:58:21 2015 UTC,Get another complete buckle and some webbing and make an extension. Pretty easy solution. Also you will lose weight if you use your pack a lot.
CampingGear,3c2eim,PyjamaRamas,3,Sat Jul 4 03:13:06 2015 UTC,Nemo designed their Nocturne for side sleeping.  Another thing that I have been seeing an explosion of is quilt style. This might also be a good (can't say for sure since I don't have one). Nemo has another example which you can find similar of in the other big companies since it is the hot thing now. You will also need to make sure your pad is insulated for these guys.
CampingGear,3c2eim,curiousincident,2,Sat Jul 4 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I use the Nocturne and it is really nice for side sleeping."
CampingGear,3c2eim,vjmurphy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the Nocturne actually looks perfect. OutdoorGearLab say I'd be better off with Feathered Friends Penguin which seems difficult and expensive get in Australia, $650 AUD plus whatever taxes I'd be charged as well.  As an alternative they recommend a Marmot Plasma 15   The Nocturne I can get for $440 AUD which seems reasonable.  The tango looks good thanks, but I think I might get more room with the Nocturne.  Appreciate the advice!!"
CampingGear,3c2eim,makinbacon42,2,Mon Jul 6 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"Feathered Friends are probably the best bag of the lot that's been recommended here, there's no way I'd go with the Marmot as its a full mummy and too tight for good side sleeping. Keep in mind Outdoor Gear Lab's results are skewed more towards the climbing and lighter weight hiking crowd (you can see this in their reviews and how they weight their scores) which is why the FF and the Marmot rate more highly over the Nemo."
CampingGear,3c2eim,Lakestang,3,Mon Jul 6 07:42:19 2015 UTC,"No idea if you can get them in Australia, but, Big Agnes makes several bags that may work for you. Look at the Hog Park (synthetic) or the Lost Ranger (down bag). If nothing else, the dimensions listed for these bags will give you a point of reference. They seem to be tailored to the side sleeper or larger person.   The Hog Park is truly huge, but, still fairly light. Here. This beast works with a 25"" pad. This is the bag I use for car camping. Big and pretty heavy, but, very comfortable.   The Lost Ranger is also generous but, as it is down, compacts down to a reasonable size. Here. This is a smaller bag intended for a 20"" pad  For me, as a side sleeper, the generous cut at the shoulders made both of these bags better fits.   Also, they both can be purchased in left or right hand zipper. This was very important for me, because I always prefer sleeping facing left and having the zipper in the right place makes this much more comfortable."
CampingGear,3c2eim,Lakestang,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think those ones would be good for car camping, but a little heaving for hiking.  If you sleep on the left then do you prefer to have the zipper on the left?  I haven't worked out which would be the preferable side for the zip to go?"
CampingGear,3c2eim,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:37:15 2015 UTC,"The Hog Park bags are huge. The Lost Ranger works good for a backpack, fits fine, not super heavy.   I sleep on my left and prefer the zipper on the left, so, I can unzip a bit, as needed and have the side without the zipper at my back. This has made sleeping in a bag much better for me."
CampingGear,3c2eim,widgetjam,2,Mon Jul 6 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"A great option with everything you're looking for (blanket mode, wide, full zip, good for side sleepers) is the Sea to Summit Trek series.

The TK1 is the temperature you're looking for.    http://www.seatosummit.com/product/?item=Trek+Tk+II&o1=0&o2=0&o3=042RR"
CampingGear,3c2eim,makinbacon42,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"That does looks good and cheaper than the Nemo Nocturne 30.    Looks like I'd get more space with the Nocture, just need to decide if it's worth the extra!"
CampingGear,3c2eim,makinbacon42,2,Mon Jul 6 05:05:41 2015 UTC,"If you haven't looked at them, check out buying a quilt instead. While pricey, they are very versatile in how you sleep with them and spread out like a blanket giving you the option to cover what you want to be covered."
CampingGear,3bzwmz,mooncoyote,9,Fri Jul 3 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"For clothing you'll want a Base-layer, Mid-layer and Outer-layer. Your base layer is for moisture management and is worn almost all the time, your mid layer provides you warmth and can (should) be multiple garments to provide better warmth and flexibility and your shell layer is for weather protection (wind, rain snow, etc.)  The main principle behind layering is that you want to use every item in conjunction with each other so you can change garments depending on the temperature and not be stuck too hot or cold without something in the middle. As well as each different layer fulfilling a different purpose.  I'll do a list of recommendations of what I would call ""quality on a budget""  Shell layer:     Marmot Precip or Outdoor Research Helium II as well as their matching pants, they're both 100% waterproof as well as breathable.  Frog Toggs aren't too bad of an alternative if you're on a tight budget   Mid layer:   Uniqlo Ultralight Down Jacket or if you're happy to spend more the Patagonia Down Sweaters are really good (try to find one with a hood) and Lightweight fleece from Target etc. if you really want to splurge Patagonia R1 and Outdoor Research Radiant's are awesome    Baselayer   Icebreaker merino is the best option here, ~200 weight and you're set. If you're happy with funky colours you can often find them cheap-ish on clearance or sale.  Patagonia Capeline is a good synthetic alternative to merino if your skin is very sensitive. Cheap Polypropylene is okay but will majorly stink after one wear.   As for what clothes you would wear all around Prana Stretch Zion Convertibles are much loved around here but as an alternative gym leggings are good too. Merino wool tee's are great for general wear but synthetic gym tee's and singlets are good too. Top that off with some sythetic or (merino) wool underwear and socks of your choice and you're set to go.  Sorry if it's a bit everywhere but its late here, feel free to ask any more questions on gear and clothing or send me a PM."
CampingGear,3bzwmz,makinbacon42,2,Fri Jul 3 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"Really helpful, been looking for something like this, thanks!  I'm a little uncertain whether I need a down jacket as my mid layer, going to be trekking in Tasmania and New Zealand in every season except Winter.  Wondering if it'll be too warm?"
CampingGear,3bzwmz,PyjamaRamas,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely to a down jacket, I'm a west Aussie and have done a fair bit of hiking in Tassie and NZ. You can get some pretty brutal swings in temperature especially in the mountains. I personally pack my down in any season other than the 4 months around summer as its warmer for its weight than any fleece and especially in winter here which can be like Tassie and NZ spring/autumn."
CampingGear,3bzwmz,makinbacon42,5,Sat Jul 4 05:02:22 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming  Don't worry about a 4 season tent unless you plan on doing a lot of winter camping, they're much heavier than their three season counterparts. If you're planning each time to go with another person a 3 person tent is a good idea (or a 2+ style tent). Good brands are REI, Big Agnes, Marmot, MSR, Tarptent and many more but your budget is the main limiting factor as you can spend anywhere from $100 to 400+.   The Kelty Cosmic Down 20 would definitely be one of the most recommended bags for people starting out around here. Its currently on Massdrop for $99. Marmot, Rab, Big Agnes, Western Mountaineering, Feathered Friends and Cumulus all make great sleeping bags too but will be pricier (but better). It's also worth noting that women do sleep colder than men (about 10-15F if you were to put a number on it) so you will have to account for this too.  Another super important thing to consider is your sleeping pad, you lose a lot of heat through to the ground. I'm a big fan of the Thermarest Neoair Xlite as well as the Thermarest Prolite. Other brands that are worth considering are Exped, Klymit and Sea to Summit.  For charging solar panels aren't really worth it IMO, the best solution is a 10,000mAh battery pack such as this, it will do around 4-5 charges on your phone without having to worry about charging it during the day or dealing with solar panels.  If Osprey packs fit you well (the main consideration) the Ariel, Viva and Aura AG series are all great packs. 50L is pretty standard for most 2-3 day trips without super lightweight gear, 60/65L could be a better option especially if you're wanting to carry a harness, rope, helmet and a gear rack when climbing. Gregory, REI, Deuter and others all make good packs that are worth consideration too and will have similar warranties to Osprey.  Vegan food is something I can't really help you with unfortunately, if you do a search of /r/backpacking /r/campingandhiking /r/trailmeals /r/wildernessbackpacking and any of the other affiliated subs there will definitely be some good resources. Also dehydrating your own food is a great way to reduce the weight and volume your food takes up as well as taking some extra tasty stuff that you normally couldn't when fresh.  For tips   Have fun! things might hurt, you might be cold or wet but you'll have some of the best times of your life with your hiking friends (similar to what I find with climbing) Merino clothing and socks are amazing, they might seem costly but they never stink and always feel good Buy nice or buy twice (this applies to most bits of kit, though there are exceptions) As long as you have a tent, a sleeping bag, a way of cooking, food, fire, a light source, appropriate clothing and a method of contact everything else is really just an addition to that. People have made do with far less or more, it just comes down to what you're comfortable with. Don't be afraid to push your limits, but as with climbing listen to your head and make smart decisions Always let someone or two know where you are going, what time you're expected bag, your route and what to do if you're overdue   I'm going to do another post for clothing so it isn't such a big wall of text."
CampingGear,3bzwmz,makinbacon42,4,Fri Jul 3 16:04:24 2015 UTC,3 season will be fine unless you plan to winter camp regularly. I'd recommend at least a 3 person tent.
CampingGear,3bzwmz,alfredbordenismyname,4,Fri Jul 3 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"It is definitaly not for everyone but check out r/ultralight. I am not ultralight by definition but i try to keep my gear as lightweight as possible without losing too much function or comfort.   If your pack weighs 20 pounds you can go for miles and miles feeling pretty good.  If that pack is 40 pounds you might be miserable.   Again I'm not saying everyone should go ul but it's worth looking into the philosophy before spending tons of dough on gear.  I think going with a ul tent sleeping bag and pack are a good starting point because they are going to be you're most expensive items.  You don't want to buy something only to realize a few months later that there is a better version, half the weight, for only 50 or 100 bucks more.   Also less is more,   don't waste time or money with chairs, plates,  saw, or any other gadgets that seem cool but you never need and weigh down you're pack. A few companies i like, tarptent for tents  enlightened equipment for a quilt osprey packs are good,  expensive a little heavy but that's what i use Columbia clothes are nice but thrift store stud is great as well..

CampingGear,3bzwmz,nobToU,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"You don't need a solar charger unless you'll be away for weeks at a time. A small portable battery/charger will do fine.  Assume that a tent size is one smaller than stated. For example, a 3p tent is really a 2p tent plus gear.  3 season tents can be used in the winter as long as it's not too extreme. Most of your warmth should come from your sleeping pad/sleeping bag.  You can get a decent intro sleeping bag for ~40/50 bucks. For an intro item that'll last a lifetime, the Ridgerest sleeping pad will do. After a little while you may want to upgrade to an inflatable air mattress.  Overall, be willing to adapt and think outside the box when it comes to using gear in multiple ways/packing it.  Sorry, I'm on mobile so can't see your question and forgot what else you asked."

CampingGear,3bzwmz,Dookieboot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Beginner - start by being an expert on route finding.  Always carry the '10-essentials'  From my experience, if you can stand the extra weight get a bigger tent than you need.  If you get stuck in a rainstorm, or have a dog, the extra space will be invaluable (I had a golden retriever).  I'm vegan/vegetarian, and you'll find some freeze-dried meals that meet your qualifications.  I've been taking things like oatmeal, popcorn (and oil), grains, etc.  Make sure the stove you use has a low-enough setting, and is not just for quick boiling.  I think there is a backpacking food subreddit, but I don't know what it is...  I've been very happy with Patagonia clothing, they seem to last forever.  The most important safety tip I ever read: the 180 degree turn.  In other words, if things get weird turn around and go back."

CampingGear,3byg9e,phroz3n,4,Fri Jul 3 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"I had an ENO with straps. It was much better than a tent. I enjoyed it. Upgraded to Whoopie Slings. That cut about 8 oz out which was nice. Plus setup is much easier to dial in. One problem with ENO is that the hammocks are made of three pieces of material, so your calves go across the seam when you try to get a good diagonal lay. The seams sort of restrict your ability to lay diagonal and instead just make useless flaps of extra material. The other problem is that they are heavy compared to some of the cottage industry hammocks. You see ENOs all around because they're available in stores and come in pretty colors, but for actually sleeping, I'd look elsewhere.  Now I have the Dream Hammock Freebird made out of the ArgonD fabric and Whoopie Slings suspension option. The fabric is fantastic. The built-in structural ridgeline makes setup perfect everytime. I love the ridgeline organizer. Best part, it was only $75, suspension included. That's less expensive than a comparable ENO setup. Also, the hammock and suspension is only 14.6 oz, which is still about 4 oz. lighter than the ENO even after adding custom suspension. It is also made from one piece of fabric which allows for you to use the full width when laying diagonal. I can't recommend Dream Hammock enough. Just be ready for a wait. It could take a few weeks for Randy to custom make your order."
CampingGear,3byg9e,scfoothills,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:18:56 2015 UTC,Their hammocks use quality material and construction. I feel the wait time is worth the product you end up with.   Peace of mind comes with the purchase when you know that you are getting a custom-made hammock with quality fabric/stitching and you can put a face to the maker.

Or use the Atmos as a very clunky, heavy daypack. You can still hike a lot of miles in a day in a backpacking pack. Or you can go Ultralight and use a day hiker for short backpacking trips. A friend and I used my 20 Liter Manta and a TNF Verto 26 as our bags for an overnight backpacking trip. I strapped my tent on the outside of my bag, and we managed to fit everything else inside"
CampingGear,3bxr7y,torrent7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:20:25 2015 UTC,"I also have the Talon 22, its awesome. Enough space for two people on a day hike with jackets if its chilly."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,anythingcanbeadildo,3,Fri Jul 3 07:18:21 2015 UTC,"dude, get the 50 for the overnights, but get a cheapo 20 liter or thereabouts for days.  I live in socal and have to carry my entire days worth of water for me and my dog and I don't even have a pack over 22 liters."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,anythingcanbeadildo,2,Fri Jul 3 03:24:49 2015 UTC,I'm thinking something in the 35 range that can tighten up nicely.  Money and space is tight so I'd like to avoid multiple purchases.
CampingGear,3bxr7y,anythingcanbeadildo,4,Fri Jul 3 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"If money is tight don't get an Osprey, I mean they're really nice but you could get a good quality and useable pack for less than half the money from REI or something.  Especially if you shop around or wait for a sale.  you could literally get a nice REI pack and throw it away and buy a second nice REI pack and still pay less than for the Osprey :)"
CampingGear,3bxr7y,Orange_Tang,2,Fri Jul 3 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"Any decent reccomendations?  A big draw for the osprey is the warranty and build quality,  I really like to buy things to keep.  From what everyone is telling me it sounds like I won't be using the Atmos often so it seems like a waste when I can just get a 35-40L."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,anythingcanbeadildo,3,Fri Jul 3 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"Get your all the stuff you would bring on a trip and weigh it and see how big it all is.  Then buy a bag that can fit it all and hold that weight comfortably within your budget.  people recommend this bag and that bag and this bag, but when you go try it on and load 35 lbs of sand bags into it at the store and walk around it might feel lousy for you.  Theres no easy internet answer, if you want the best bag for you its important to figure out your gear and go try on bags in that class.  I was dead set on a gregory Baltoro until I went to the store and tried it on full of weight, then I completely switched gears and got an osprey I hadn't even considered previously and I love it."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,Orange_Tang,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:34:31 2015 UTC,"Rei's warranties are legendary as you have probably heard, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. I suggest going into one of their stores and seeing what you like. Maybe do as some others have suggested and lay out what you plan to bring with you first and use that for a size comparison before you go in for a test fit."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,Titanium_Expose,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:06:45 2015 UTC,"Go to REI and look at them.  They aren't as good as osprey's but the arent bad either.  I have an osprey because I like to buy once and keep forever as well.  But I use it a good amount and could afford it at the time.  Invest heavily in what you will use often and will bring you the most satisfaction.  I'd get more spendy on a day bag if that's what you use most.  Or get a medium bag and try and go light on the overnights.    REI has a good warranty, but its not forever no questions asked like osprey, i think it's more like a year no questions asked and beyond that you may get denied but I've never had an issue with a legitimate item breakage not due to misuse or excessive wear.  Ospreys I think you can intentionally ruin and they will replace it.  But like I said, will you really use it enough to destroy it?  even if you do you will probably want a bag with the newer lighter better designs the future certainly holds by then."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:31:23 2015 UTC,What you said is all true but it does come with a heafty price tag. Not that it isn't worth it if you are willing to pay for it. It really just comes down to what you want / are willing to pay for. Price seemed like a concern from the other comments since the op mentioned wanting a single bag for day hikes as well as multi-day hikes so I figured id suggest a solid cheaper option.
CampingGear,3bxr7y,third-world-king,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think REI's house brand is the best in terms of value for your money. Go to REI, tell them your needs and budget, and they will help you choose a pack."

CampingGear,3bxr7y,life-goes-on,3,Fri Jul 3 03:56:07 2015 UTC,if you are only going to use it for day hikes then yes it is far too large. However if you plan on using it in the future for a 3+ day trip then i would encourage you to pick it up. even though it is large for a day pack it could still be used for it as there is a lot of singe straps to make it as compact as possible
CampingGear,3bxr7y,Incognito_Whale,2,Fri Jul 3 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"It is probably too large for day hikes, but it also depends on what you typically bring. If I am bringing a lot of camera gear on a day hike I use a 40L pack. If you are just out enjoying the scenery without any special gear requirements, the REI Flash 18 is small, light, and around 30 dollars. It can be found on sale periodically for 15-20 dollars."
CampingGear,3bxr7y,Incognito_Whale,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:15:43 2015 UTC,90% day use? Absolutely go smaller (and likely cheaper) . Lay out your gear for the average day hike and buy a pack that fits that gear. Why lug around more?

The engineering in this tent is really cool, from the twist lock system for connecting to the poles to the star gazer rain fly and the almost completely mesh upper. I paid $200 for mine and that was 20% off. It assembles in no time and is pretty comfortable. Plenty of headroom with the high ceiling and almost vertical walls so you can sit up straight with no problems. I'm also more on the average size at 5'9""and I fit in quite well. The tent is not as long as most traditional tents so you won't have as much room at your feet or above your head for gear, but it has two giant vestibules to compensate for that. As for quality, I can't say a whole lot yet as I've only had mine out a couple of times, but so far it's survived a night in 3 inches of snow and below zero temperatures (I would not recommend trying this)in dolly sods state park in WV, so it has that going for it. Lol. I hope this helps. Happy trails!"
CampingGear,3bvqlx,FiveHorseJ,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"3 inches of snow in Dolly Sods is a GREAT test of a 3-season tent, if yours survived it then that is definitely a good sign. My Mountain Hardwear tent was sagging under the weight of 4+ inches, also in Monongahela but father south"

The vestibules are huge, so all the gear goes in them. Headroom is very nice. We survived 0°F in Zion in it and stayed dry through quite a bit of rain leading up to that. I put it in a different stuff sack than the one it came in though so that I could strap it to the outside of my pack.  I definitely recommend this tent."

I used it with myself and another person and we fit with plenty of extra room.  I also tried it, size wise, with two friends that are both 6' 4"" and we fit, but just barely. Their feet did touch the far side though. It seems to be a nice tent and good quality. I also paid a lot more than that so it seems like a great deal to me."

CampingGear,3bvqlx,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"It is very good for a Kelty, which is a nice tent brand, but usually far inferior to Big Agnes, Mountain Hardwear, MSR, even North Face or REI (sometimes). This tent seems like an exception. This tent is lightweight and looks strong and well-made. Probably still not as light as Big Agnes or MSR, or as tough as Mountain Hardwear, but it is much cheaper than its competition in the same weight class and is still spacious too. The only thing I don't like about it is its square shaped stuffsack. I'd buy a 12 or 15L compression sack to put it in instead. 185 is a good price, so why not?"

I recommend that you go with a good two-man tent. Big Agnes makes some really nice, really light ones.

I'm 5'6 and she's about 5'1. I do manage to put our packs by our feet. But I'd say a two person should be perfect for you and your dog. Mine only weighs about 3 lbs, I can stuff the tent in my stuff sack with my sleeping bag and then just stick the poles and stakes on the outer bags of my pack.  But that's just my two cents.

CampingGear,3br0ah,StonerMeditation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"With weight playing a huge factor in their design, one person backpacking tents are typically very snug for that one person (also made of lightweight, oft fragile material).

You can see on the footprint diagram that there's room to sleep in the center, then a dog and pack on either side of you.  It's 1.5 lbs without stakes or poles. You can buy a set of poles for it on the website that weigh 3.6 oz for a pair. The one downside is that it's not freestanding. It must be staked out.  I've really enjoyed mine, been s great tent.

In the new model it looks like they changed the hubs up to mitigate some of the stress issues. Of your 4 tents it will be the most durable unless they botched the re-design. It has a heavier-duty fly and floor fabric.   The advantage of the BA is that the tent is half the weight. All of the others are in the 4-5 lb weight class."

CampingGear,3blstv,Tigerballer88,5,Tue Jun 30 06:48:53 2015 UTC,"go to REI or another outdoor outfitting store. It's important you get a pack that actually fits you and that you learn how to adjust it properly and employees of those stores are trained to show you how. I would recommend at least a 50L, so you have space for food, water, a tent, sleeping bag, and other essentials. Even if it's only 8 miles, backpacking is something you should never take lightly. It's important to be prepared - emergencies do happen. I've been that person who said ""eh, it's only a short trip, I won't bring extra warm clothes or extra food"" only to be caught in terrible weather, putting me at risk for exposure. Brands I would recommend would be Osprey, ULA, or Gregory."
CampingGear,3blstv,jd0708,3,Tue Jun 30 13:20:17 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation too not long ago; - first backpacking hike (in recent years anyway!) - 14miles - 1 night across Dartmoor here in the UK (so not much in terms of altitude mind you!).  The most common thing I read before buying my backpack was to pack as lightly as you can; so you'd be better off deciding what you're going to be taking with you in your pack before you start looking at litre sizes. If you've got small lightweight gear, you're going to need a smaller pack than if you've taking heavier, bulkier gear.  As always, you get what you pay for in terms of quality; and a good pack will last you for years. After looking in numerous stores (in the UK) I decided I wanted an Osprey pack - the build quality is superb, all their packs have great reviews and best of all have a lifetime guarantee. They are pricer than other brands, but I decided it was worth it.  I ended up getting an Osprey Aether 60 - not the lightest of packs itself, but it's built around a solid frame and lots of handy little features. There is a great review showing off its features here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4JPiklpZ1A and an update for the newer model here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq08EhWhB48  Whatever you decide - make sure you try the pack on in a store before you buy; ideally with a similar weight to what you'll be carrying in you can - that way you know it's going to fit you well (and might make you re-think what you want to take when you get weight on your back!).  Good luck and enjoy it out there!"
CampingGear,3blstv,gbuckingham89,2,Tue Jun 30 08:18:33 2015 UTC,I second the Osprey. I had mine for just about 10years.  I recently walked 1200km around a Japanese island and some of the stitching on the shoulder straps came out. I got home and took it to a distributor. The replaced all the broken bits without a single question. I bought a new one and gave my old one to a friend who needed one.

CampingGear,3blstv,OliverTheWanderer,2,Wed Jul 1 07:25:00 2015 UTC,"Backpacks are a lot like shoes. You pick the basic characteristics you want and then go try a bunch on and buy the one that fits best. You need it to fit you well, and everyone is shaped a little differently. While you're shopping, ask a salesperson to help you fit them. Any decent pack will be adjustable in a lot of ways and the salespeople should know which straps to pull and all that.    Whatever you do, don't pick a pack before you go. You might find it fits you all wrong. A lot of people here are recommending Osprey and it is a good brand, but I can't wear their stuff because it always chafes my neck. I prefer Gregory packs."

CampingGear,3blstv,kyuss80,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"Big piece of advice: I wouldn't recommend buying 'beginner' gear. You'll buy a $40 backpack that will be uncomfortable and poorly made, and will last you for 6months to a year until you decide to buy a better pack for $100.   My advice would be to start off with gear, especially a bag, that will last you years and be great in every situation. I use the Teton 4600. It's 75 litres, extremely comfortable and adjustable, has all the bells and whistles of a $300 bag (compression straps, water bladder hangar/pocket, comes with a rain cover, many tie down straps, etc) and is affordable."

CampingGear,3blstv,PriceZombie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Go to REI and try all the bags you think you like on. I guarantee you that some will fit and others will not. Generally, if one bag fits you poorly, that means another will fit great. This is the most important thing. Do this first.  For 2 night trips, something in the 55-65 L range should suffice. Unless you are a hardcore minimalist, it's hard to see how you can get 3 days/2 nights worth of stuff in a smaller sack. Don't worry about the weight as much - if a bag fits well and transfers the weight properly, an extra pound or two will not matter.  Once you have found the bag that fits you best (only try them on fully weighted otherwise its pointless) shop around. I happened to find the bag I wanted on a website for $50 less than any other retailer. If there are no huge price differences, buy it from REI because a.) You'll get 10% back as a dividend, and b.) you can return the bag for up to a year after purchase.    If you have any specific questions let me know. Good luck dude, and have fun!"

Thicker wood/branches are good for axes/hatchets, brush/vines/etc are better for machetes.  Not sure about the quality anymore, mine are fairly old, but I like True Temper axes, and Link hickory handles if you need to replace those.  Most machetes are pretty cheap, I like Imacasa (worked in Central America for a while, everyone uses these), and Tramontina machetes.

Much of your phone's power is gonna be hunting for that wifi hotspot in the tree and cell tower on that peak; you just need GPS, and maybe not even that much of the time. Just use turn Airplane mode off and on, and use text instead of voice.  And the solar panels for battery charging are meh. Many only provide barely enough wattage under ideal conditions.

I tend to like the separates rather than having two in one because, if one thing goes wrong - like the battery stops charging- I can always go an buy another one and still have the solar panel.  Also, it seems like most separates have less chance of going wonky (technical term there) than items that are sold as solar charging/battery/radio/flashlight/alarm clock type deals.    So far, my setup works well.  It takes about a couple of hours in partial sun to recharge the battery from a half charge.   I normally leave it in the sun while I'm out and about (like in a window or tied up to a something heavy where others would see that someone was messing with your stuff) and don't worry about it much.

With my girlfriend (now wife) I use this as a quilt with a liner over two mats and as a personal sleeping bag it's just perfect. The feet have a drawstring which I find easier to operate in constricting areas.   When I did the east & west aurthurs in tasmania a few years ago, this was the bag I used.   Also an Aussie brand."

CampingGear,3bkjjg,littletuckoo,3,Mon Jun 29 23:46:07 2015 UTC,"I really don't think you're making a bad choice either way. I prefer having at least a 2-person tent because I often DO backpack and camp with others, especially my girlfriend, and because while I have a narrower pad for just myself, usually my gf and I sleep on 2 25""-wide Nemo Cosmo mattresses, which necessitates 50"" of width in the tent. Here are pros and cons:   Tarptent: you have to use trekking poles to make it freestanding, otherwise it has to be guyed and staked out. This is a minus in the places I normally backpack, which are quite rocky, and if you cant guy it out, it won't hold up well to wind The fishook is slightly heavier, but has none of these downsides. It is fully free-standing, you can get the footprint to do the lightweight tarp setup if you want, and Big Agnes is a bigger company with a great warranty. I think this tent will be less of a hassle, even with the extra pound."
CampingGear,3bkjjg,dangerousdave2244,2,Tue Jun 30 00:32:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. The tarptent ended up winning me over after you mentioned the freestanding thing. Solo rocky camps are rare for me as I tend to prefer grassy/wooded places, so I think I'd do okay without a fully freestanding tent."
CampingGear,3bkjjg,always_wear_pyjamas,2,Tue Jun 30 04:41:38 2015 UTC,"The tarptent DR isn't too bad for two people. You don't have loads of space, but for sleeping it's not snug for average sized people. I've done week trips with my full sized friend, and while traveling I've slept in there with my girlfriend and another average sized girl without problems. Really nice all-around tent, the weight and price are almost unbeatable."
CampingGear,3bkjjg,arkady48,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:59:54 2015 UTC,We have a tarptent rainshadow II. And love it.   You can use trekking poles to stand it up or you can buy extra regular poles for it.   Easy tent to put up and take down and lots of room inside
CampingGear,3bi2p4,kyuss80,4,Mon Jun 29 12:02:47 2015 UTC,"I know you just like the look, but let me just point out that tents, rolls, etc. strap on to regular bags just fine.  Agreed that is a good looking pack though! I'd definitely see what their return policy is. Make sure it fits you and is comfortable. If it is, and if the capacity is what you need - I say go for it. It's what you like and if it will encourage you to get out and use it then why the hell not.  Same way I feel about milspec guys who want to look like a special forces soldier when they camp...hey if it gets them outside and enjoying nature then I'm all fort it!"

I'm still trying to figure out the sleeping situation as I'm an awful restless sleeper and hate mummy bags. I have another whole thread in r/backpacking for that problem, lol  As for the milspec guys, I have a 5.11 Tactical Rush 12 pack I got from a work project, it's really nice, and I have a US Colonial Marines (Aliens franchise) patch on the back of it.

The only time I would look down on it if its objectively bad at it's job, but I've found that a number of good companies are popping up that manage to get the best of both worlds.

It's weird that the model in the photo doesn't know to run the tie down straps around the frame to secure the sleeping bag so it doesn't flop around.  Also check this out.  About one pound!
CampingGear,3bi2p4,demonxcat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:56:51 2015 UTC,"Given my current state of fitness maybe I need to take a few extra pounds, haha. It is funny how they didn't tie it down more securely, but I notice that in a lot of modeling photos.  Man, that zpack is light!"

CampingGear,3beu9r,eggyegg,7,Sun Jun 28 16:07:34 2015 UTC,You'll get better replies if you add more information. What kind of hiking and climbing are you doing? How long are your trips? What is the longest trip you plan to take? How many liters is your current kit? Do you need to upsize or downsize your bag based on your current kit? Do you need to buy new gear for your trips? Are you willing to buy new gear to make it fit into a smaller pack? What is your base weight? What is your max weight?

CampingGear,3beu9r,Lighthand,2,Sun Jun 28 17:44:18 2015 UTC,"I can't help you out with any of the other packs you mentioned,  but I have the Alpinisto 35; I use it for overnights,  craggin,  and ice. Honestly,  I'm not a huge fan.  I wanted it for a while and ended up being a little disappointed when I finally put it to use.  I'm not fond of the tool connections,  I'd rather a loop than the metal piece,  especially with gloves on.  I would strongly prefer the hood to float a bit more,  by the time it's loaded with a rack,  rope,  and helmet it's at its limit. I realize I could have upsized,  I'm just suggesting a bit of adjustment would have been a usable feature. The crampon pouch is usable but not really a defining feature for me.  On the flip side,  its a great quality pack and climbs well."
CampingGear,3beu9r,J0nes373,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, Should've added more info. I mainly hike with the occasional light climbing - nothing too technical, and for this bag its mainly a day hiking bag during winter and 1-2night overnight in summer. I'm replacing a old 45L bag, so I'm in the market for something that size. I've also got a smaller 25L bag for 1d summer hikes and a larger 65+15 for longer hikes. Gear wise, I'm really not planning on getting anything new just for a smaller bag, I'd much rather get a slightly larger bag to fit my current gear. I'm a 6'0"", 75kg person. I've never really measured how heavy my bag gets but I'd guestimate in the region of the 16-20kg. I hope this is enough info.  Thanks Jones373, i guess that rules it out for me.   Probably looking between the osprey variant 37 (looks a lot larger in person than other 35-40L bags) and the millet prolighter 38+10. Saw it in the shop today and it looked quite promising!"
CampingGear,3bdbgk,fendermallot,2,Sun Jun 28 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"Any 20"" wide pad will fit as long as it is 3.5"" thick or less.

CampingGear,3b8up0,DerSoldierSpike,2,Sat Jun 27 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"Tarptent Double Rainbow perhaps? It allows for small awnings and is super light, but maybe not quite what you are looking for.  As mentioned earlier, the Big Agnes Wyoming Trail is a good option.  The MSR Hubba Hubba has a gear shed you can buy which provides a decent sized porch. The 2014 redesign made everything lighter but it may not be as durable as the older version. You can also get the Nook which has a gear shed option as well.  Maybe consider a decent tent and a good tarp? I have a Kelty Noah's Tarp 12, which I really like. I picked up some collapsible aluminum poles to help with hanging options and so far I am really impressed with it. I know a lot of moto campers over here do something similar."

CampingGear,3b6vk4,SlumLord666,3,Fri Jun 26 14:43:04 2015 UTC,do you use one for dirty and one for clean?  Or do you use the bag for dirty and fill the two 1L?  Just curious as I am planning to bring a platypus bag for dirty and (2) 1L smart water for clean
CampingGear,3b6vk4,TrustyOneHit,2,Fri Jun 26 17:41:43 2015 UTC,No I dont use the bag it came with at all. I've heard pretty bad stories about it.

I feel like i did a bad job explaining it
CampingGear,3b6vk4,SlumLord666,2,Fri Jun 26 17:57:48 2015 UTC,I do the same. Just fill the smartwater bottle and take off. Be careful not to lose the gasket when unscrewing the filter. Mine always tended to stick.

It's a lot cheaper, and works the same way. If you buy the 2 bladders to make your gravity system it would work stupendous."
CampingGear,3b6vk4,ballstatic,2,Fri Jun 26 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"If you use a bladder, the fast fill adapter is a great convenience item.

CampingGear,3b6vk4,Graybealz,2,Fri Jun 26 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"Just be wary of the bag it comes with. The mini fits well on smartwater bottles, as well as platypus bladders. Definitely get another bladder.   When I was backpacking in Lost Creek Wilderness in CO, my sawyer bag broke on day 2 or 3. I probably used it maybe 10-15 days in the backcountry beforehand.

CampingGear,3b5ns8,ObiDumKenobi,-6,Fri Jun 26 06:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not trolling. Level I and Level II are just shy of 3lb put together and they are always in my pack. I'll admit I've never had use for the FiberFix and (thankfully) the Israeli bandage or CPR mask, but everything else in the first two bags has seen use. Sometimes the use wasn't even medical in nature.  Could I get away with less, sure, but I can give you at least one experience for everything in I and II.   The third bag typically stays in my car unless we are going a full days hike from help, or if going in as part of my bug-out kit. Now, as part of my bug-out kit, a little knowledge of chemistry goes a long way with the bulk of the weight in the third bag... although that is more the TEOTWAWKI nutter in me than necessity I'll admit.

CampingGear,3b5ns8,Westbrook000,3,Fri Jun 26 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"You've used almost everything in your 5-pound first aid kit at least once? Jesus Christ.

I go backpacking all the time, and take a 4.9-ounce combined survival and first aid kit, and I've always had anything I've ever needed.

CampingGear,3b5ns8,ObiDumKenobi,4,Sat Jun 27 02:21:06 2015 UTC,"So as part of a bug-out kit, I can see that making sense. But I wouldn't carry that out on a backpacking trip probably ever.   Ditch the activated charcoal, unless you are foraging for food and foresee a potential poisoning issue? Even then, charcoal doesn't help in all cases. Dramamine. If you're just backpacking, are people getting motion sick? Unless you're using this on boat/plane rides, seems unnecessary. Same deal with a scopolamine patch. I would ditch at least one of the CPR masks. Just cause you have it and your GF didn't want it doesn't mean you have to carry two with you! I would probably ditch both. The odds of you ever using one are incredibly remote, nor would they really help you if you are that far in the backcountry.  Perhaps swap out a smaller bottle of saline? I see you also have sodium chloride in your L3 kit. Why not just carry that around, and make saline if you ever need it? Carrying enough salt to make 3oz of saline would be trivial. Unless this is your backup contact lens solution, in which case I would still say you can downsize. Why are toothpaste, floss, and lip balm in your L2 kit? backups to your regular toiletry kit? What do you plan on using the FiberFix for? Also with regards to your L3 kit, you have an IV needle, but no IV solution. Are you planning on making your own IV fluid w/ the sodium chloride? If so, what container are you using for it? Also, do you have experience placing and monitoring IVs? While it might seem like a convenient way to treat somebody for dehydration, it is also easy to overload somebody if you aren't aware, which can lead to things like pulmonary edema, kidney failure, and lots of other unpleasant things.   Where do you typically go backpacking? On trail? Bushwacking? High altitude like the Sierras or Rockies? Swampland? Do you go with large groups? Any details would also help in figuring out what is really necessary for a trip."
CampingGear,3b5ns8,5000miles2boston,6,Fri Jun 26 08:37:10 2015 UTC,"? While it might seem like a convenient way to treat somebody for dehydration, it is also easy to overload somebody if you aren't aware, which can lead to things like pulmonary edema, kidney failure, and lots of other unpleasant things.    worse than overload would be the dirty non sterile fluid directly into the blood stream.

CampingGear,3b5ns8,cjpkiller,4,Sat Jun 27 23:20:26 2015 UTC,I would love to hear other people's suggestions for ways to improve this kit.
CampingGear,3b5ns8,curiousincident,7,Fri Jun 26 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"Why the tea tree oil? you have ethanol in your level 1 kit, which from what I read about, tea tree oil does the same things.  Get different; lighter, waterproof bags.  Why double cpr masks?  Smaller versions of things in kits is probably a good idea too, for example- you will never need that much honey on a single trip, get a smaller container for it.  Heavy things are usually your enemy when backpacking.  I don't know man... your level 3 kit is probably useless, because if they can survive to get back to base camp/car, but need something from that kit, they can probably survive being brought to the hospital, but that depends on how far out you are.  if space and weight aren't issues though then sure throw it in the trunk and probably never use it.  Oh and add some moleskine to level 1 and 2.  Can never have enough moleskine.  Also sunscreen."
CampingGear,3b5ns8,5000miles2boston,-2,Fri Jun 26 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"I use the tea tree oil as both a fungicide and a bug repellent. The ethanol is to drink, sterilize or burn. Yup. I think I'm just going to make a couple mini, waterproof stuff-sacks. Because I had two and my GF refuses to take it. Actually, had a guy fall into the coals one night. Used most of the honey to coat the gauze roll before wrapping; it kept the wound clean and unstuck on the trip out to the hospital. Moleskins are in the Level I bag, just forgot to mention them. Little sunscreen backup too.   Like I said though, as part of a bug-out kit I don't mind the extra few pounds given the weight of the rest of my gear. Anyway it's late, might get some love, maybe some hate, but either way I'll have to respond tomorrow."

CampingGear,3b5ns8,lavaslippers,0,Fri Jun 26 14:15:37 2015 UTC,"Since I was asking for people's feedback in earnest, no, I'm not embarrassed.  Have I been wrong using honey on burns for years? Maybe, but after being cooled and sterilized I have never experienced a negative reaction so I will continue to do so and you can say, ""I told you so"" if I get an infection. I never claimed to be a doctor but I expect you are, given your vitriol and haughtiness towards me. I would like to (and I am sincerely asking) know which fire and rescue squad because maybe I can learn something new. In the end however, you're right, the best thing to do if injured in the woods is to sit down and enjoy a nice peanut butter and honey sandwich. Nobody has ever died from dysentery, an allergic reaction, or exsanguination when closer to appropriate medical care before, right?"
CampingGear,3b5ns8,curiousincident,4,Sat Jun 27 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"I think his other problem is safety. If he's used almost everything in the kit, he is doing a lot of things wrong.

I think I've only used it once and that was for a blister."

There really is a reason people try to pack ""ultralight."" If you get it down to just the bare essentials, you can have a ~10lb pack before food and water.

CampingGear,3azr4z,hamleteatsoatmeal,9,Wed Jun 24 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"I've been researching these ""premium"" coolers for a few weeks now so I feel I can answer your questions.   1: Is one of these better than the other by a large margin? Or are all 3 relatively similar?   There isn't much that separates the different premium cooler brands (Yeti, Orca, Pelican, Bison, Grizzly, K2, and Engel are the ones that readily come to mind). Warranty, hardware, size and weight are probably the biggest differences between these brands. Here is the warranty breakdown for these seven brands   Yeti: 3 year Orca: Lifetime  Pelican: Lifetime Bison: 5 year Grizzly: Lifetime K2: 7 year Engel: 3 year    2: Does the fact that they are stand alone bear lockers an actual benefit?   All of these brands claim their coolers are ""bear proof"", but that isn't actually true...not without a padlock anyway. Popular Mechanics did an actual bear test and found that a bear could pry open the rubber latches with his teeth, whereas he was unable to open a Pelican cooler with actual press-and-pull latches. I would say it's a benefit to have these types of latches and rubber latches you simply pull to open are a potential weakness, unless you padlock the cooler shut.   3: What would be a good size recommendation for the cooler? 2 people for 5 days - we are not big drinkers, so no worries about beer or canned beverages.   Without knowing how much you two normally eat, I would recommend a cooler around the 60 quart size. This gives you plenty of room to pack it with ice (most people don't use enough ice) and still have 15 meals for two people in there.  Honestly if you're only going for five days, assuming you aren't opening the cooler regularly, a Coleman Xtreme 58 qt should be fine. They aren't as durable as the brands listed above and don't have as much insulation, nor are they ""bear proof"", but if that doesn't matter to you then this should work for what you need.  If you need a cooler that is actually bear proof without a padlock, get a Pelican. It has a lifetime warranty, a track record of excellent products, and the latches are actually bear proof. If bearproofing isn't really required I would also consider Orca or Grizzly, as they both have lifetime warranties and you can padlock them shut if needed. Orcas and Grizzlys have a form factor more like the Yeti, whereas the Pelican is bulkier.  A few more things to look at when selecting your cooler:   Interior dimensions will vary and actual cooler capacity can vary, even if they both specify ""65 quart capacity"". For instance, Yeti coolers don't tend to hold what they say they do. Outdoor Gear Lab reports the Yeti Tundra 45 actually only holds 38 quarts, whereas the Pelican 45 Elite actually holds 45 quarts. This may or may not matter to you. Some of these coolers are quite a bit heavier than others. Some of this can be attributed to the fact that the cooler is actually bigger (Yeti Tundra 45 vs. Pelican 45 Elite), so it's almost an apples to oranges comparison but even when normalizing for that difference there are some brands who make coolers that are simply bulkier and heavier than others. If you're car camping this likely won't be a problem. If you're moving the cooler around a lot, it probably will be.   Let me know if you have any more questions and I'll do my best to answer them. Have fun on your trip!"
CampingGear,3azr4z,zambezy,2,Thu Jun 25 13:28:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the information! That was REALLY helpful!   Really the thing that I don't want to do, is buy something cheap now and then end up buying something else in 1 year. I guess I would rather buy a quality product up front rather than buying something cheap now to only have to buy something else later.   That is honestly my biggest hesitation with the Coleman. Although the price point is attractive, I am worried it will break or not perform well from the start. Have you had any personal experience with the Coleman?"
CampingGear,3azr4z,zambezy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have any personal experience with Coleman coolers but I own other Coleman gear, both modern and older, and they've all held up well. I have friends who own Coleman Xtreme coolers in various sizes and haven't heard anything negative about them as far as not meeting their needs. It isn't going to keep ice for ten days but it should do five provided you pack it full of enough ice, aren't opening the cooler frequently, and try to keep it in the shade as much as possible.  The cheapo cooler I use for float trips and things like that is the Igloo Ice Cube 48 qt. and it works perfectly well for keeping beer, water, and food for two people cold for two days. I've had it for 8 years now and the only thing that broke on it is the dry storage compartment in the lid and that was because someone stood on it to reach a shelf.  I feel like the Coleman Xtreme 70 would work great for you two."

CampingGear,3azr4z,211logos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Something we have in a cooler used for rafting is a dual door. It has a smaller door and compartment near the top that you can use to access it without opening the main door, and so it helps to keep the cold in. We'd take frozen stuff from the bottom and let it thaw there during the day. Dunno if any of these have that feature, and I can't remember the brand."

CampingGear,3aynv4,buddboy,5,Mon Jun 29 16:22:42 2015 UTC,1 liter is good for two people in most circumstances
CampingGear,3aynv4,Snowflake_51,5,Wed Jun 24 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"I have the Halulite Microdualist set, and my general impressions of it are good, but not great. Knowing what I know now, I'd probably piece together my own set.   The sporks in the set are crap, buy your own aluminum/titanium ones The mugs are awkward, but nest nicely in the set, the neoprene ""insulation"" makes hot things comfortable to hold, but doesn't keep them hot well The pot is a fine size, but a little too tall. It's a bit shaky for my liking on a canister stove. Not that only smaller fuel canisters will fit in the pot. The strainer lid is handy, and it cooks pasta and more extravagant meals pretty well.    All in all, as my fiance and my first cook set, it fit the bill and was a nice package, but you can have more convenience/personalization making your own set."
CampingGear,3aynv4,taxandhike415,3,Wed Jun 24 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've only used a 1 liter pot (A Primus one similar to those you have listed) for about four years. I think 1.8 Liters is far more then you need for breakfast and coffee, but I guess it depends on the breakfast. I have found 1 liter to be plenty for one-three people when I am mostly heating up water for coffee, tea, freeze dried meals, oatmeal, etc. 1 liter is a tad over 32 ounces, and there aren't too many times I need more than that, but when I do I can just heat water up twice. I recommend just thinking about everything you plan on using the pot for, and if nothing requires over 1 liter then go for a 1 liter. Another advantage is a 1 liter pot is usually a perfect size for fitting one fuel canister and a small stove. Additionally, my aluminum 1 liter has started to rust (after 4 years of use), and my next pot will likely be the snow peak 900 titanium which is lighter, but I'm not sure which would last longer."
CampingGear,3aynv4,swampwalker906,3,Wed Jun 24 16:18:23 2015 UTC,my aluminum 1 liter has started to rust (after 4 years of use)   Aluminum will corrode but it doesn't rust.
CampingGear,3aynv4,taxandhike415,3,Wed Jun 24 16:54:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction. Is it still safe to use after it has started to corrode a bit on the inside?
CampingGear,3aynv4,taxandhike415,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. Yeah I looked up a couple of those Backpackers pantry style meals and they said they needed 2 cups of water. So I knew I needed at a minimum a liter pot. But does the volume mean it will hold a liter? (like filled to the brim) or is there some wiggle room built in.  I am willing to bet that a liter will do almost everything I need. But if i end up camping with the SO, I could see me needing more.  Thanks again."
CampingGear,3aynv4,Vardeeg94,2,Wed Jun 24 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, most of the freeze dried meals I have used require two cups of water which is 16 ounces so roughly half of a one liter pot filled up. Boiled 32 ounces in a one liter would likely not be ideal since it would be completely filled to the brim as you mentioned. I think if you were making two freeze dried meals at the same time with a one liter pot, it would be easier just to boil two cups separately, but the convenience of this depends on the stove set up you are using. Generally when I use freeze dried meals with my SO, two meals are too much food for us, so we split one and supplement it with snacks or something else."
CampingGear,3aynv4,haroprease,3,Wed Jun 24 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"Ive got the Pinnacle Dualist set. I've dont trips with two people and trips with well over 4 people. The 1.8L seems to be my favorite size to date. I've beat it to death and it still holds up. It's been to festival camping, backpacking, hiking, camping, etc and has held up EXTREMELY well. The sporks suck so i highly suggest getting another one. And i carry a different mug with me for hot drinks. But the cups and bowls work great.   To give you a little bit of an idea of how i pack mine, i basically have to bowls for myself, that ill put my zipplocs in that are holding my dried food and ill have a folding spork that also fits inside. Because the two bowls pack into each other so nicely it leaves me room for my stove and fuel.   All in all, the pot is really the only thing i like from the dualist. It's size is perfect for pretty much anything."
CampingGear,3aynv4,Vardeeg94,2,Wed Jun 24 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"How do you get fuel and stove to fit inside? What stove do you have, and do you only use the smaller fuel bottles? I can't get both a 8oz canister and my MSR Pocket Rocket in there.   To OP's questions, I feel pretty much the same way about my Dualist. The pot is outstanding, the sporks suck, and the nesting is a nice feature. Breakfast for 2 should really only be about one litre of water, so you have more than enough capacity."
CampingGear,3aynv4,lyonslicer,2,Thu Jun 25 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"So heres how i fit it. Inside the pot is the bowl and the cup nested within each other, then inside of those two is my stove. I cover that and drop it to the bottom. Then i put the fuel and pop the lid on and im good to go. I usually never need more than the small one.

However, if you don't want to use the jetboil's pot and want a great, small canister stove, get the Optimus Crux Lite.

CampingGear,3aykkw,Yoziggy,3,Wed Jun 24 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"You would likely get a better sampling by posting your question in /r/Hammocks and/or /r/hammockcamping, but I'll give you my two cents here.  I should start by saying that I don't how much room for improvement there really is in this space. There already is quite a range of options in this area that are light enough and cheap enough. Unless you were able to come up with something revolutionary with absolutely no compromises on weight, strength, or price, it'll be hard to be anything more than ""yet another choice.""  The first thing you'll want to sort out is whether you're thinking of the entire suspension or just a tree hugger. When people say ""hammock straps"" they can mean either, but most of commercial the variations on straps (ENO SlapStraps or Atlas straps, Kammock Python straps, etc.) are full strap-based suspensions where the strap is providing both the adjustability for the girth of the trees and for the distance between them.  These tend to be pretty heavy, though, and not any more cost effective than lighter options like tree huggers and whoopie slings, which separate those two adjustment points into two separate components.  Another strap-based approach is to use a buckle-type suspension like this Warbonnet one or this Dutchware one. They save weight over the webbing daisy-chain systems by not needing a doubled length of webbing.  For serious gram weenies, Dutch recently started selling Kevlar straps and huggers, which are significantly lighter than standard polyester, but are also significantly more expensive and are susceptible to degradation over time from exposure to sunlight.  Personally, I use huggers and whoopies most of the time and don't really have any complaints. I also use that Warbonnet webbing system on one of my hammocks and don't really have any problems with it either."
CampingGear,3aykkw,HeyRememberThatTime,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know what's in the market now. My first was an enos. I lost it and made my own. I later found it in my sleeping bag for some reason.   If you found an easy way to turn a standard cheapo rectangular sleeping bag into an underquilt and sold it as a DIY kit I think it would do quite well. I'm still playing around with ideas but am willing to do more than most.   I have a pretty simple whoopie sling, nylon straps and a hitch with a little bar setup for suspension but think tree protectors might help. But there are many diy options there.   Just a thought. Goodluck in your business."
CampingGear,3aykkw,5000miles2boston,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"There are a TON of different kinds of suspension systems. It sounds like you're targeting the mass market eno buying type folks, so you're going to want to stick with something simple and not get into things that are lightweight. Honestly, my favorite so far is the warbonnet webbing buckle suspension. It's extremely flexible, easy to adjust and fast to setup and take down. Dutchware makes a system like this as well. The slap straps and stuff are like ""baby's first suspension"", and aren't worth the weight or the cost."
CampingGear,3aykkw,mvmntsofthemind,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your advice, it is extremely helpful. It looks like i'll just be going with a simple nylon strap. Is there a color that seems to be more popular or even a certain type of hook you guys would prefer? Or anything else you would like to see included with your straps?  I'll probably be selling something similar to the atlas strap so anything to help differentiate myself would be great.  Thanks A lot!"
CampingGear,3au0uh,Tux274E,12,Tue Jun 23 14:34:01 2015 UTC,Propoer clothes. Hiking in cotton anything is a no no. Get some nice boxer briefs from ExOfficio and maybe a nice wicking T shirt. Oh and smart wool socks.
CampingGear,3au0uh,strickt,11,Tue Jun 23 15:17:34 2015 UTC,Darn Tough socks!   Edit: sorry that sounded dickish of me. I'm just really excited about Darn Tough :)
CampingGear,3au0uh,geosyrrus,3,Wed Jun 24 03:24:16 2015 UTC,Agree on this one. Darn Tough are so much better than Smart Wool. Don't shrink and don't pill unlike the experiences I've had with Smart Wool.
CampingGear,3au0uh,curiousincident,8,Thu Jun 25 11:44:06 2015 UTC,Or just get some synthetic shirts and undies from target for 1/4 of the cost. Don't skimp on socks though!
CampingGear,3au0uh,nomansslave,3,Tue Jun 23 22:03:25 2015 UTC,I find the ass and crotch blow out of those things pretty quickly... That is a strange sentance to write at work at 8 am... lol
CampingGear,3au0uh,strickt,3,Wed Jun 24 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"There are racks on racks of athletic shirts at Goodwill and similar places for like $3 each.   TJ Maxx is another good place. I get UA and similar compression shorts for hiking, plus Smartwool socks at certain times of the year."
CampingGear,3au0uh,demonxcat,3,Wed Jun 24 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"Those exofficio underwear are uh-mazing. Make socks your first priority, but dem underpants your second."
CampingGear,3au0uh,merpsalot,3,Wed Jun 24 08:29:50 2015 UTC,"If that were my gift card and I had your current setup, I'd go for some clothes and smaller odds and ends. You could look into stoves or cookwear, but it will destroy your gift card instantly and you can find much cheaper options like the $7.00 msr pocket rocket clone on amazon. I found a lightweight pot with plastic lid very similar to the jetboil setup for $20 at one of my local outfitters. Combine that with the ""clone"" stove and a fuel canister and you've got a ~$30 setup that rivals the big name $100+ ones (in my opinion at least).  Someone mentioned exofficio underwear and I definitely second that. Maybe some Prana convertible pants, and darn tough socks since those happen to be in many people's clothing lists."
CampingGear,3au0uh,Irish33Laidir,3,Tue Jun 23 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Sawyer Squeeze, easily one of the most important pieces of gear you can carry. Some extra bladders or the platypus ones for water storage, or in case you break one filtering water. A good knife, even the Carbon Steel Mora from amazon for $15 makes a great knife and you can use it to strike a fire starter. I recently picked up a buff and I've worn it fishing and hiking for extra protection on my face or to keep the sweat out of my eyes. Definitely check out a 10 essentials list here"
CampingGear,3au0uh,curly1022,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"Squeeze as an inline filter (not the slower mini).  Just use the Sawyer bags and get the adapter, a hose, and a mouthpiece.  You can then also use it as a gravity filter for other people abd cooking."
CampingGear,3au0uh,IH8DwnvoteComplainrs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the suggestions!"
CampingGear,3au0uh,dangerousdave2244,0,Wed Jun 24 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"If you aren't trying to go super ultralight, Katadyn and MSR filters are better made, better tested, and last much longer. The katadyn ones work faster, and don't require a dirty water bag. I have the Hiker and Pocket, but if I were you, I'd get the Katadyn Hiker or Katadyn Mini  The reason I'm saying anything is that Sawyer has legions of fans, but independent testing by Tufts university had damning results about the effectiveness and longevity of Sawyer's filters, that after a short time of use (in lab conditions no less) they could actually make the water DIRTIER"
CampingGear,3au0uh,xxse7en,3,Thu Jun 25 11:54:10 2015 UTC,"As others have suggested, a stove and a sawyer squeeze are probably the next logical things to get. Other ideas to add to the list:   A decent clothing layering system - merino/synthetic base layers, insulating mid, a lightweight/compressible puffy (the nights even in SoCal can get chilly at elevation or in the shoulder seasons), windshirt and/or rainjacket outter, hat or buff Good footwear. Depending on the terrain and the miles you're planning, the comfortable sport sneakers you probably already have will be fine. If you start doing higher milage you might consider getting some decent trail runners. MYOG first aid kit stuff Headlamp Cat hole trowel A bear canister (if you plan on going where they're required/recommended or if you don't know how/don't want to learn to do a proper bear hang) A dehydrator to make your own backpacking meals   If you'd care for any specific brands/items on any of those, just ask."
CampingGear,3au0uh,pto892,4,Tue Jun 23 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"If you're going to do the pack last (good idea, btw) then I would suggest dealing with your cooking gear and/or water filtering options.  Pretty much everyone is going to tell you to get a Sawyer Mini or Squeeze for water purification-the only caveats with them are to not let them freeze overnight.  That leaves your cooking gear-what do you want to do?  Only heat water or cook more elaborate meals?  If you want to go lightweight and save some cash then make an alcohol burner like the Penny Stove or the Supercat for the burner and then take the saved cash and invest it in a titanium pot like the MSR Titan, Snow Peak 700, or the like.  Otherwise you're looking at a canister stove setup like the Jetboil which I personally don't like since it ties you to their pot.  Something like a MSR Pocket Rocket canister or one of it's many clones lets you choose a pot (or pots) that fit's your pack and style.  A small pot for solo trips, and a larger one for group trips is how I do it."
CampingGear,3au0uh,GangofYangs,3,Tue Jun 23 15:02:32 2015 UTC,Be sure to check out the Rei garage sale. Big savings on items big and small. Rei membership is your friend.
CampingGear,3au0uh,maxillo,5,Tue Jun 23 15:02:31 2015 UTC,If you have time you can save a ton of money by waiting for sales and getting used equipment.  REI garage sales are terrible though (I am just saying this so you are not there getting the stuff I want the next time I go.)
CampingGear,3au0uh,5000miles2boston,3,Tue Jun 23 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"I love the REI garage sale. Just went to one two weekends ago. Got there kinda late, but I was able to grab a fleece and lightweight jacket. Baby steps :)"
CampingGear,3au0uh,GangofYangs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:29:39 2015 UTC,How often are the garage sales
CampingGear,3au0uh,crappuccino,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"They have them 4 times a year. Mine just had one, call your local one and find out!"
CampingGear,3au0uh,Sneezer,2,Tue Jun 23 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"Nationally, they're held quarterly. Some stores might hold them more often than that.. check each store's calendar online at rei.com/stores"
CampingGear,3au0uh,asdfasdafas,2,Wed Jun 24 03:12:42 2015 UTC,"Flexlite chair or something similar is a welcome luxury. I have the Helinox version, but several friends have the REI flexlite and they all like it. The Helinox is a little larger and more robust than the REI one, but it fits me better. Assuming you are not 200+ lbs, then the flexlite would be nice to have."
