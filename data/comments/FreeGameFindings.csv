FreeGameFindings,3aquoh,thisismeonly,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"The longevity of Dell systems have always been less than adequate in comparison to better brands, unless you were purchasing enterprise-class machines. As a computer repair technician with over 11 years of experience, I have seen thousands of Dell systems with physical failures. That's not to say I haven't seen just that many problems with other major brands such as HP. However, for the same price, you can purchase a system from a manufacturer such as ASUS and have 2-3 years additional life without failure. However, that price/longevity ratio is much worse with the Alienware brand, because the price is higher, but the longevity is not. Historically, Alienware systems were made with better parts, and therefore commanded a higher price. When Dell purchased the brand, they kept a higher price, but began to use their standard quality parts. An Alienware system is now simply the same quality/longevity as a standard Dell, at a higher price."

Also these magical radiation portals pop up around the random and block your way encouraging you to go a different way, or risk your life to take them. They damage you. I don't like them very much.
