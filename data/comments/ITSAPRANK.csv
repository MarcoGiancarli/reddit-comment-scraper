The problem is that it's extremely hard to know if anything bad happens due to the interference of these YouTubers. The one thing that is guaranteed; they're making a shitload of money from helping these guys. If they weren't making a profit, they wouldn't be helping.  So when news about Josh trying to get his lawyer to screw this guy over gets out, it gets a bit out of control. Of course we'll never hear the end of this situation. It's just sad that someone who was involved with these pranksters has actually died. And furthermore, it's hard to label this man as a victim. Was he? He got some money and a bit of fame. I mean...Josh did help him but he did it in the worst way - ""hey here, have some money and let me show people how altruistic I am and make money from ad revenue that you won't benefit from."" Except this time someone tried to get some of that money.  Eg - OckTv has a similar video with like 10 million views and that homeless man's story? Nobody knows.

Something didn't necessarily have to change for him to drink himself to death other than his body finally not being able to take it anymore.

ITSAPRANK,3cghuk,pyth1100,12,Tue Jul 7 21:52:01 2015 UTC,"It does a couple things, helps me remember if I looked at the post and it (I think) helps you guys judge whether or not it's worth your time.   People post so much stuff that barely fits the posting guide lines here that if i deleted everything that wasn't 100% relevant we would barely have any posts. I try and remove the trash that doesn't fit but there is just so much borderline content here.  Any rate if you have any input for the sub I'm all ears. I'm always open to make this place better for everyone."
ITSAPRANK,3cghuk,wobinidan,6,Tue Jul 7 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"I think you're doing a good job. Maybe instead of 'relevant' you should give it a 'seal of approval' flair or something like that, because it's:  Probably not fake  Doesn't cause harm  Prankster has something to regret  I think these qualities make a gold submission. If a prankster gets his ass kicked, that should be violent gold. If he's trying to make black people look bad and gets his ass kicked, that should be a silver medal, for being a douche but paying the price.  I guess a bronze medal would be being a douche to people you're not scared of and not really facing any consequences but still getting them a little riled up. And no medal for obviously fake videos, or obviously easy targets, or people who are just pure dicks without facing any consequences."

That way everyone can know what to expect when they see the tag and they could easily decipher what the tag means.  I do tag videos with a 'Seal of Approval' i just feel, based on similar criteria what you said, videos don't fill all the requirements to earn the tag. So I don't tag very many videos with it. I feel like only the best videos should earn that tag. Maybe I should loosen the requirements for it?  I am the only mod that really moderates this place. I probably do 99% of everything. Unless you send mod mail no one is going to really do anything in /r/ITSAPRANK. So I try to stay on top of things and read what you guys have to say about the sub.

How is this the guy who produced the videos fault? Even if he did stage the initial $100 transaction I still don't see how he did a bad thing.
ITSAPRANK,3c6u0j,Luceint3214,31,Sun Jul 5 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"Well it's obviously not confirmed that Josh is the reason why the man died, but if you read past the headline you would know that Josh set up an indiegogo to raise money for the man in question. The campaign raised about $150k, but Josh sent the man a contract stating he could only actually get the $150k if Josh was allowed to keep $20k for ""expenses"".  The man obviously did not accept the offer and Josh is trying to cover that up by saying that the money was sent to him (which he has never shown proof). So the theory is that the man was so upset at this betrayal that he drank himself to death."
ITSAPRANK,3c6u0j,tfmm77,9,Sun Jul 5 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"He'd still be letting money go into the wrong hands.

There was also a picture floating around that showed an actual legal document the man received that he had to fully agree to in order to get the money. For an ""act of charity"" it shouldn't be that complex, and there's bound to be some sort of loophole in that document."

However, if some of his video's have content in which he gets in trouble and gets beaten up, why wouldn't you allow that video to get posted?   What you should focus on is banning/removing video's that are not relevant instead of banning channels. However I do think you should make an exception: ban links to ""community channels""(SoFloComedy/Soflopranks). They generally upload the same nonsense, spamming YouTube with click-bait titles. We should not support this in any way.  Another thing what you should take into account are the tags a particular mod puts next to the links. For example: ""boring video"" it is okay if you have this opinion about the video, but rather than posting a tag, just post a comment saying how boring the video is to you, just like everybody else. Keep the tags relevant, do not express opinions in them.  I wish you mods the best of luck because I love this sub! I hope to see it grow even further, with even higher quality content."

To me, it's the notion of someone intentionally messing with something I have worked hard for and care about. Maybe a good tangent is that you will do no true harm splashing water in a persons face and on their clothes but you might find people are quite upset if you were to practice this on random victims.

ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,collinjames,-4,Fri Jun 5 00:27:00 2015 UTC,ugh. sexual harassment isn't a joke or a prank...
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,paradoxasauruser,5,Thu Jun 4 13:54:49 2015 UTC,This isn't sexual harassment. It is a harmless joke. If they say go away and continue going after them THAT is sexual harassment. The way you define sexual harassment is basically the human right of freedom of speech.  Now if he was grabbing their ass that is a different story.
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,JMFisher4,-5,Fri Jun 5 22:47:33 2015 UTC,"Nope. ""Harassment can include unwanted sexual advances [or] requests for sexual favors."" it's by definition harassment and it's not harmless."
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,paradoxasauruser,3,Fri Jun 5 23:37:15 2015 UTC,True however there is no way to know if it is unwanted until the girl says no. The girl has to say no first.  Would it be sexual harassment if I walked up to a random girl and asked if she wanted to have sex with me and she said yes? No that wouldn't. You can't just assume they will not like your offer.
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,JMFisher4,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:39:15 2015 UTC,But the point is that's not an appropriate thing to ask complete strangers. Preface it with a few drinks and conversation at the bar at least. It makes a lot of people feel very uncomfortable and in some cases very unsafe.
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,paradoxasauruser,2,Fri Jun 5 23:41:28 2015 UTC,I agree with that. It is not an appropriate thing to do. Nobody should do that. You are a scumbag if you do treat women like that.  My issue is you can't make that illegal. It is free speech unless it is continued advances or physical advances.
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,JMFisher4,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Mm, I understand having preoccupations towards illegalizing speech. Then again, you can't go around saying ""I'm gonna blow up the white house"" so there are some things off bounds. But I'm glad we agree on what's important, which is that this isn't acceptable and should be called out even in ""prank"" contexts."
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,paradoxasauruser,-5,Fri Jun 5 23:50:27 2015 UTC,why would someone downvote this?
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,AskMeGermanStuff,3,Thu Jun 4 17:19:24 2015 UTC,because it isn't sexual harassment. It is a joke. Sexual harassment would be continuing to pursue the girl after they told him to go away.
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,JMFisher4,4,Fri Jun 5 22:48:50 2015 UTC,i think people interpret it as SJWish. but i don't think it's unreasonable to say that going around asking people (women or men although it can be especially threatening to women) for sex and sometimes making them feel physically threatened/uncomfortable isn't really a clever prank and falls squarely under the definition of sexual harassment (ie very easily could get you fired from a job).
ITSAPRANK,38ftpv,paradoxasauruser,-2,Thu Jun 4 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, defending women on Reddit is a weirdly dangerous game. My theory is that like a lot of internet communities we have a lot of lonely woman-hating gents around. Defending women even in seemingly one sided arguments can often result in people inboxing you relentlessly with insults like SJW. It's pretty awkward all in all."

ITSAPRANK,3761ix,Tom__m_,14,Mon May 25 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Most stuff passed off as pranks really is just people being annoying or cruel and then calling it a prank.
ITSAPRANK,3761ix,Honkey-Dong,10,Mon May 25 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"Judging by how the victim reacted (panicing at the mere mentioning of spiders, being paniced when the tarantula was put on his head, screaming, vomiting and more) i think i can safely say he has arachnofobia (fear of spiders).  In this case this ""PRANK"" is not a prank, its psycological torture."

This isn't some guys ""pranking""strangers on the street, it's someone who was said to be pranking others. If the guy hadn't been restrained and had killed the tarantula and then everyone got mad because it was a prank, that would be different. He may have gone too far but, we don't know that this guy wasn't already going too far with his pranks. I hate that I'm saying anything which defends something Vitaly did."

What I said was that I was ok with this because he was someone already playing pranks. That means my argument of why I was ok with this is that he isn't some random person on the street. If you're playing pranks on other people, you should assume people will play pranks on you. I stated that they may have gone too far, which is what I would think as this is pretty cruel, but, we don't know what the guy did to the girl. My stating that we don't know what he did was because I'm not going to state that they definitely went to far.  Edit: fixed make to may"

When children approached, Alba allegedly revved a real chain saw at them, causing Leslie Garcia to flee in terror into 36th Street, where she was struck by a truck.   I mean, the way law sometimes works in America its not that out there. He does have a point, the girl was struck by a truck as a direct result of a ""fear prank"" that was being held on the property of the home.   Same as if I slip and fall in a store, I can sue the store so really.. this lawsuit is not a waste of time and they have a good chance of winning."

Thus he is a direct cause of the child running in fear and getting injured. Liability is a bitch man.    Heres another example, you shoot a guy trying to kill you, that bullet goes through the guy and hit a civilian... your still liable and lawfully in trouble   A store has a wet spot, the spot was a customer dripping liquid and the store doesnt know its there cus the customer left. You go strolling through kinda quick cus your in a hurry slip and break a hip for example, the store is still liable.   Like i said, liablity is crazy and it applies to a lot."

In a lot of crimes the criminal can be held accountable for tertiary incidents.  For example, I rob a bank and run from the cops.  The cop's hit a car and kill the driver, boom I'm up for some form of manslaughter right?   I feel like that should apply to overpenetration and missed shots.  If I put someone in a position of defending themself, then I should be responsible for the outcome provided their responses are within reason."

ITSAPRANK,36k2t1,HorriBliss,20,Wed May 20 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"It starts with some blonde American woman (who is attractive) saying: ""Be careful online"" and some black fella from London comes in and says the same shite.  New scene:  Blurred face man and blondie enter the room.  They chit-chat, she gets flirty, undoes a few of his buttons on his shirt.  He hesitates: ""Are you sure this is OK?  Is anybody home?""  ""Yeah, babe, it's fine, don't worry about it..""  Few minutes later, when the guys shirt is off (he has an undershirt on), black guy enters.    ""What the fuck are you doing with my girl, fam'?"" Basically this  Black guy makes the blurred face man face the wall:  ""Yeah, look at the wall you prick!""  And just intimidates him a lot.  Eventually makes him do press-ups.  Then they all sit on the couch, blurred face man in the middle.  Black guy tells him to give him money.  Takes out his wallet and there's only £30 inside.  Mocks blurred face guy and his shoes.  I should note: blurred face guy is clearly terrified (I'd be too) during this whole thing, and he says he's a law student so he'd be late teens/early twenties at most.  Anyway, black guy takes the wallet and sees a bank card.  All three walk to the ATM.  The camera man follows at a distance.  There is a man at the ATM ahead of them.  So they wait.  Black guy mocking blurred face man the whole time: ""Stop looking so fucking scared"", etc.  When they get to typing in his PIN then he pulls: ""Yo, look there, it's a prank, there's a camera.""  Blurred face guy covers his face with his hand and runs away.  They jog after him, girl saying: ""Your jacket, don't forget your jacket!""  Black guy yells: ""It's just a prank, don't call the police!""  Camera cuts to a few minutes later?  He has his jackey on and is talking to Blondie.  Black guy is about ten feet behind talking to the camera man: ""He says he's gonna sue lol, guess I better give him back his £30"" and takes it from his pocket.    The video ends as he approaches the fella.  It's like an 8 minute video, too, so it's long."

ITSAPRANK,364jub,jamiemac2005,3,Sat May 16 06:10:01 2015 UTC,"You are 100% right but there is a legal reason for this too. If they, as the instigators, fight back then they are will get in trouble. The tldr is that even if the threat isn't real, as long as the victim believed within reason that it was real, the accused will be guilty.  Eg. The one where they grab cellphones. That fits the elements of robbery - Common robbery is the unlawful and intentional forceful removal and appropriation of movable tangible property belonging to another. (important factor is the use of force or violence) Someone grabs your phone in the street? You are allowed to get it back. If they then hit you...they are fucked.   The definition of common robbery is pretty much universal. These arseholes basically go around being dicks and committing crimes and getting hit. If they hit back...they are fucked."
ITSAPRANK,364jub,PromisedPrince694,-3,Sun May 17 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"The instigators would not ""get fucked"" if they were to hit back. It is called self-defense. It is the prankee's fault for being overly-sensitive about the prank, and it is the exact same as someone hitting you in the face because you called them an idiot. It is illegal nonetheless. Do you think that these people have the right to maim/injure the prankster just because he made them feel pissed off?  LMAO, your life is not in danger if someone grabs your phone. You are allowed to use force but when it borders excessive force then it is unjustifiable. From what it seems, the prankees feel more inclined to beat the person to a pulp (because the prankee is lacking self-esteem and/or education) than get their belongings back. But also, how about the non-physical pranks, that is to say the verbal pranks? Like do you want to help me ""bust a nut""? If someone responded with violence to that, then YES, not only would the prankster be able to fight back (self-defense, legal) but the prankster would NOT be charged with ""disturbing the peace"" nor would he be charged with ""disruption"", as it is the prankee's fault for getting pissed over an ambiguous non-malicious phrase. Oh and yes, regardless of whether or not the prankster fights back, the prankee will still get charged with assault either way (in the case of a verbal prank).   tl;dr; If the prankster fights back after the prank victim attacks him/her because of a verbal prank (non-physical), then the prank victim will be charged with provoked assault/common assault regardless of whether or not the prankster fights back. If the prankster fights back, then it will be 100% legal, as it is classified as self-defense."
ITSAPRANK,364jub,aSdhASKJDHASKDHAS,6,Tue Jun 9 03:14:04 2015 UTC,Watch TwinsTv. They don't fight back but they don't bitch out when they get hit and scream that it's a prank either.

ITSAPRANK,364jub,SirSmokesAlott,-1,Sat May 16 12:57:33 2015 UTC,"Are you a dumbass? It is called PROVOKED assault. It is assault nonetheless, and it is the equivalent of lashing out at someone because they called you some sort of pejorative. If you use words to provoke someone, and they lash out at you, then you have the right to defend yourself from them. Full stop. It does not mean that you are deprived of all rights just because you are the instigator; even if they intentionally/unintentionally started a fight, they would have the right to defend themselves, which is called self-defense. It doesn't matter whether or not the objective of the prank was to start a fight, but all that matters is that the pranksters do have the right to fight back if their life is in danger.   p.s. Did you even read anything that I wrote? I said NON-PHYSICAL pranks, like telling someone to ""kiss my ass"" or something of the sort. It is the victim's own responsibility to not be an untamed chimpanzee and go all ballistic on the prankster. I don't understand what's so hard to comprehend in my argument; if a white person calls a black dude a nigger, and if the black guy responds with violence, then it is NOT considered a hate crime, and the black guy will end up with charges of provoked assault. It's not that fucking hard to understand. You clearly don't know your legal terminology well enough.   EDIT: You and 3 other people clearly don't know their legal terminology well enough. Actually, you and three other people don't even know the law well enough.  DUH."

Btw I'm not in USA and not everyone is from USA way to confirm the stereotype that Americans don't think any other places exist when the ocean starts.

ITSAPRANK,364jub,SirSmokesAlott,0,Tue Jun 9 08:52:49 2015 UTC,"Gotta love the assumptions. I suppose you inferred from my diction that I was from the USA? I'm not even from America lol... Also gotta love how you can use your telekinetic powers to somehow be able to figure out how I'm feeling lmao. Way to confirm the stereotype that idiots enjoy to make xenophobic assumptions while sounding incredibly pompous. Laws may vary in Third World countries and in the dregs of society, but in countries that are considered to be developed and civilised, for example, the UK and others, assault is illegal regardless of the degree of verbal provocation that is given (unless it is in self-defense). This is especially true if the prank involves slang/idioms that have ambiguous meanings, like ""bust a nut"", for example (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEQjQNdRks).  The legal definition of self-defense is this: he use of reasonable force to protect oneself or members of the family from bodily harm from the attack of an aggressor, if the defender has reason to believe he/she/they is/are in danger. Self-defense is a common defense by a person accused of assault, battery or homicide.  As you can see, the victim of the prank would in no way, shape, or form, be in any danger whatsoever as a result of a petty insult, and the excuse that ""I was in danger because of (insert excuse about hate crimes here)"" or some other excuse will hold up pathetically in court. Not to mention, the police and other judicial officers would be able to look at the video footage and decide for themselves whether or not the ""words"" used would have caused any concern for the victim of the prank. In the case of the ""bust a nut"" prank video shown above, this would not have been a justifiable reason for the victim of the prank, and thus, the aggressor would be liable for provoked assault. In any other case, though, this would still be the same case.  The legal definition of assault is this: with the intent to cause physical injury, actually causing such injury to another person.   A person is not exempt from assault charges, regardless of whether or not they were insulted or took offense at a particular statement.    I suggest that you don't give any legal advice/information unless you actually have some experience in that particular legal field, too. Stop whining.  And no, I didn't take all day to write this comment; I type at 130 wpm so this was a cakewalk.   ty"

You wouldn't have a leg to stand on. You cant use it's a prank to claim self defense when you are the aggressor you are the aggressor because a prank isn't  mutual agreement and the victim has the personal right for you not to invade his space and to think he was in danger as a result of your prank! For example "" I'm gonna pop you"" the victim would be in his right to punch you because he would believe his life was in danger.. You cant hit back and say it's self defense you cant use that as a legal loophole to start a fight... Every time someone genuinely stared a fight the could just say it's a prank it was self defense?! You think that's acceptable? You're a fucking moron.  Don't bother replying I have better things to do then to satisfy your craving for petty arguments. See what I mean if you are like this IRL I would be walking away civilised and it seems to me you would keep going to rile me up to punch you and then you'll go play the victim won't you?

If the prank victim decides to fight back, then he will and can be sued for assault.   holy shit, all your arguments are just so biased from the looks of it"

ITSAPRANK,364jub,aSdhASKJDHASKDHAS,0,Mon May 18 11:18:38 2015 UTC,"That's not true. If you were to prank (non-violent) someone, and they were to respond with violence, then it would be provoked assault. ALTHOUGH you may be charged with disorderly conduct, the guy attacking the prankster will still get charged with provoked assault. If a prankster were to fight back, then it'd be classified as self-defense, because the prankster did not throw the first punch/kick. Do you think calling someone an ""idiot"" warrants a vicious attack? No. Humans have self-control, and this is why we have battery/assault laws, where it is NOT justifiable to attack someone UNLESS you feel your life is being endangered, which would be self-defense. From these premises, we can conclude that the prankster fighting back would be perfectly justifiable and would fall under the category of self-defense."

ITSAPRANK,337ddq,agitpunkt,3,Mon Apr 20 10:31:08 2015 UTC,"Use diatomaceous earth for bed bugs. It's a white powder, about the consistency of flour or baby powder. You can buy it by the pound from gardening stores, and it's super cheap. Try to get food grade (yes, it's 100% edible,) because some makers will add toxic chemicals to it (which you really don't need.)  It works by drying them out. See, to us it just feels like flour. But on the microscopic level, it's made up of very sharp pieces. They aren't enough to bother us, but those sharp pieces wreak havoc on bugs - It gets into their shells, and cuts them up when they move. Almost as if all your joints were suddenly made of sandpaper. They rely on their shells for moisture retention - they dry out, because their shell is full of tiny cuts.  There are tutorials on how to apply it, but the basics are pretty simple : Make a powder ring all the way around your bed. If it's on a standing frame, make smaller rings all the way around the feet. If it's on a box spring, spread some between the box and the mattress. Work it into the carpet fibers with a spatula or butter knife. Do the same all the way around the edges of the room - when bugs move around, they tend to stay near the edges. Again, really work it into any carpet fibers, and use a spatula to make sure you get it up underneath the wall moulding really well. Pretty much repeat that throughout the entire house. Don't vacuum up the excess - you want them to get completely covered in it as they move around.  Now you wait. After a few days, they'll start turning up dead. Keep waiting. More will turn up, as the eggs hatch. It'll probably take around a month before you're in the clear, but you can be sure that it's thorough. In the meantime, try to keep it as dry as possible - The powder loses its effectiveness as soon as it gets wet, because it clumps together instead of sliding between the chinks in their shells."

ITSAPRANK,2zwei2,Tragic_Sainter,13,Mon Mar 23 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"Australia != America  Very different countries, populations, societal values.   Have they ever banned alcohol in Australia? Would probably look like what happened when they banned alcohol in America during the 20's.  Que the mob scene, Valetine's Massacre, and more. Prohibition only strenghtens crime."
ITSAPRANK,2zwei2,Fallen_Angle,-10,Sun Mar 29 02:13:11 2015 UTC,What the hell are you on about? How the hell does banning alcohol have anything to do with stronger gun laws?
ITSAPRANK,2zwei2,Tragic_Sainter,14,Sun Mar 29 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"The United States made an amendment to the Constitution that banned alcohol during the 1920s.  Because alcohol was still in high demand, a number of gangs and crime syndicates were created to facilitate its existence in the US. People still wanted alcohol, and they got it. Because of the large number of mafias and gangs, all sorts of crime went up.  The 18th amendment (banning alcohol) was later repealed by the 21st amendment... and crime went down.  Now, I'm saying banning guns in the US would be a violation of the second amendment (all persons are able to own guns for use in a regulated and maintained militia) because a militia is the people, and they will be regulated by themselves should another revolution be necessary. A government cannot regulate a militia.  You might say ""another revolution? That's preposterous! Never would happen."" and I agree. A revolution will never be necessary as long as Americans have and protect their rights.  The 2nd amendment cannot be modified nor repealed in my opinion (as well as any other sane person's) as it is an integral part of the Bill of Rights, which also include the right to free speech, free religion, and many other inalienable rights.  So banning guns would only increase crime, as now the rich will still be able to afford them (buying from mafias and paying off the law) while street criminals (who do not obey laws) will still have guns.  The only people negatively affected by a gun ban in America would be the lower and middle class law-abiding citizens... who will protect them? The police?   Not the police, they have their hands full already and are corrupted by bribes.  Not the rich, vigilantism is illegal and not worth their time.  Not themselves... they can't own weapons.

I'll go off the assumption that banning guns in Australia got rid of every single gun, and there is no gun violence whatsoever (I've read from differing studies that gun crime went both up and down, so I'll just disregard making that argument). Now, Australia is an isolated island, do you don't need to worry neatly as much about people smuggling guns across the border because the country is isolated. The United States is connected to Mexico, which has crime problems as it is, and with the amount of illegal immigrants that cross the border, it's clear that things could be smuggled with them, causing a second black market paralleling the drug black market already present. Second, if you ban guns now, you're going to have a verrrryyy hard tone getting them all back. Guns are ingrained into American culture, and they're not going anywhere. Within 5 miles of my house are 3 gun stores, each with a shooting range, and 2 or 3 shooting ranges that just sell ammo and rent guns. Guns aren't going anywhere in America. Even in places like California, where there's a strong movement to ban guns, the best they can do is limit gun types and magazine sizes.  (My apologies if this isn't the most coherent thing ever, I typed it out in mobile in 2 minutes. I'll edit it later, I promise)"
ITSAPRANK,2zwei2,Marokot,0,Mon Mar 23 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, in regards to Mexico, they have very strict gun laws. There are maybe a handful of stores in which one can legally purchase a gun in Mexico. What Mexico also has is a lack of significant enforcement, and a shared border with one of the biggest gun-owning nations on the planet. Most, if not all, of the illegal firearms in Mexico are smuggled straight out of the U.S., and they cannot stem the tide because there are so many of them.  So really, any guns smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico were almost certainly first smuggled into Mexico from the U.S."

ITSAPRANK,2xl5jn,le_Dandy_Boatswain,7,Mon Mar 2 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state; some make this distinction and others do not.   What Is Assault and Battery?  Historically, battery and assault were considered separate crimes, with battery requiring that the aggressor physically strike or offensively touch the victim. In that way, a battery was a “completed” assault. Many modern statutes don't bother to distinguish between the two crimes, as evidenced by the fact that the phrase ""assault and battery"" has become as common as ""salt and pepper."" These days, statutes often refer to crimes of actual physical violence as assaults.   http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/assault-battery-aggravated-assault-33775.html  However, I checked and my state does have both as separate crimes."

ITSAPRANK,2vgfvd,PapaBee,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"Intent versus action.  The officer could arrest on intent based on the fact that he had the means, told the officer he was doing something illegal, and was near the car in question.  Let's say we do go to court.  The prosecutor could list the amount of videos this individual has on his Youtube channel and display the complete disregard for other's he had.  These ""pranks"" are destructive in nature, to elicit negative emotions to the victims.  He could say he''s mean spirited in nature, present a case on atleast giving this guy community service for a couple hundred hours.  Let's say that the prosecutor decide to be mean and mention the danger he presented to the public through his actions.  Let's be reminded of the locked weapons in the trunk of the police car.  Now we're looking at more than community service hours.  So no.  If your logic stands on the fact that the police officer can't prove intent.  Neither can the defendant.  Doing this to a cop car is dumb.  And I believe that Natural Selection should've taken place."

ITSAPRANK,2v3v07,Woopidoodoo,26,Tue Feb 10 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"He was not being detained for carrying a gun. Picture this - you're a policeman, and you are in danger for your life a lot.

I honestly can't believe you really thought the point of this was that he was getting detained for having a gun."
ITSAPRANK,2v3v07,collinjames,-29,Sat Feb 7 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"I never thought the point of this was being detained for a gun. I'm stating that what the officer did was an illegal detainment. A gun is a legal weapon to carry. This situation would be no different if you replaced the word gun with banana. Sure, the kid is an annoying fuck but you can legally carry a banana as well as a gun. And in most states you don't have to provide any kind of documentation without probably cause of breaking the law.

Carrying a concealed weapon without a permit in California is against the law, and he never said he had a permit, only that he had a gun, which would be against the law without a permit. The cops had every reason to search him for 1. saying he had a gun without giving a permit and 2. acting like a fucking insane person.  Even if he had a concealed carry permit he could get charged with assault just for running around telling people you have a gun."

ITSAPRANK,2v3v07,prostateExamination,-14,Sun Feb 8 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"So then you think it's okay for police to go door to door asking to search houses to see if anyone has killed their wives recently? Murder is illegal in California but the police can't break into your house to see if you've murdered anyone recently. There is no probable cause and that's what makes it illegal! Even if a cop illegally searches someone and they don't have a concealed carry permit it is still an illegal search and that's the point I'm trying to make. The Fourth Amendment protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures.  “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”   This isn't Nazi Germany where we have to show our papers everywhere we go."

In your example of searching door to door, it would be as if he called the police first and told them he wanted to show them his murdered spouse.   I understand what you're saying regarding illegal search. You're ignoring the entire ""prank"" in order to have a point. The police didn't detain, search, and arrest him for walking down the street or even for wearing a shirt which said ""suns out guns out"" or some other reference to his arms. They reacted to someone walking up to them and behaving strangely while talking about having a gun. That is probable cause."

Or the fact that there are 2 people recording him.  You can see as he walks up to the homless guy his buddy's shadow moving faster behind him getting into position raising he hand held camera up and pointing it down.  If this had been a hidden camera on his glasses he probably wouldn't have a visible microphone also when he tilts down you can just barely see his shoes or body. This suggests to me the camera was being held by his friend above and just in front of him by the actual camera man.

You seem like you have a lot on your mind right now and you're confused though. To be fair, your initial comparison to insulting Islam was a misstep in this discussion anyway. Verbally berating someone is different from the physical and invasive acts shown in these videos. That being said though, a fist is definitely a form of speech. If you punch someone, that's expression. If you punch someone because you disagree with what they say, you run the risk of being incarcerated, but goddamn if this isn't America and if you gotta punch a bitch, you gotta punch a bitch. I hope you aren't always so angry and off putting when discussing things though. We as a country really gotta get out of that habit."

There are women and children enslaved right now as we debate over the internet. Where's the fucking anger? It's easy to feel anger over something that happened in the past because there is really nothing that can change what happened.

You don´t even know if i am black or white or yelow or sandnigger.  It has to do with racism...what? You argue like people who argue that critic towards islam is racism.   Because your race has never been enslaved or been a part of any real hardship.   From where do you know? First, 1 million whites got enslaved by black, many people got enslaved by the turkish empire and many other cases in history.  But this is don´t even relevant, because what do you mean with my race? Whites? What is this bullshit? Wow blacks got enslaved in america, now every black can cry about all the time and be offendet.  No, you are right, not my RACE got enslaved, my grandparents and there parents got put in fucking gulags and were forced to work, the grand grandparents on my mother side got hanged, and my grandpa then was alone with 5 sisters, and had to steel food ad a little kid, and go hunt, because else they would starve, just like a aunt i never got to face because she died as a kid.  So this is nothing right? Millions of millions of people get killed for nothing. Is this a contest who had it worse? And what exactly had the blacks in america? Oh right, they got buyed off from slave dealers, means if the americans wouldn´t had buyed them, they would hav endet up in much much worse regions, and they would have black slaveowners, and they woul either just die, and never got kids, or there kids today would be starving in africa.   So what did you little boy had in your past? And i only bring this up because of your stupid point   HURR your slave never got enslaved   It don´t matters, nobody cares, its not back then, its today. Either you change or you don´t, but people like to blame all there problems on something else.   OHH back then my grand grandparents were slaves   Nobody cares. My grand grandparents also had it bad, so did my grandparents, but this is no excuse for anything, thsi has nothing to do with me, and me taking my chances i have.  Where is my special word nobody is alowed to use? There is none, because it would be fucking retarded.  I can say it again for you: Nigger. And people are don´t even offendet, they just feel that they should be offendet, i bet even muslims gets much more offendet by pics of mohamed where he get fucked, but this is no excuse for anything, this is free speach, and people praise this drawings, at the same time hypocrites like you cry about a fucking word like nigger. Grow up.   You're not thick skinned, just in a lucky position.   What?   Cracker is not offensive because it isn't attributed to anything meaningful.   Wow.   Nigger is what a black slave was refereed to.   Yeah. They were also called slaves. Who cares? Did the blacks from today were slaves?   Cracker might be derogatory but it's not offensive. If you're offended by the term than that's laughable.   Haha wow. Same with nigger. Both are just fucking words. Cry me a river.   Black people say it to other black people as a term of greeting and endearment like mate, bro, cunt ect.   Yeah of curse they do. And now?  Always this stupid texts like:   NAH if 2 blacks say it to each other its different   Nah, fuck off. Just because they are black don´t means anything. Blacks should use every word whites do, and whites every word blacks do. Because in the end we are all just people. And this little stupid word just drives us apart and don´t unites us, because they take it that serious, cry about racism, at the same time only people that have black skin can say it, but not people with white skin.  What if i am a transracial black woman that is lesbian?  Means i am a black woman that likes womans, in a white mens body.  Would you say just because i have white skin i can´t feel black?   It probably makes you jealous that blacks have this unique saying and that there is no white equivalent.   Yeah, this is it. It makes me jealous. Just like all this people are jelous of mohhamed.  Thats the reason why humans always break tabus, because they are jelous.  Why would i be jelous, i already can say nigger when i wan´t.   Make as many reddit comments as you like, you can't control it and it's probably never going to go away.   I can´t....can´t controll what? I already do, just look at me, i can say nigger everywhere i wan´t. We don´t have many blacks here, and i can say free around them nigger, and neger, because my country has nothing to do with murricans calling niggers niggers, and this people here never were slaves, because they are not from america. And of course i ask them if it offends them, and they just laugh, and say they don´t fucking care, its just a word. Just like i call muslims here sandneger, or mudskin, or they call germans Kartoffel, because this are just fucking words, and if you can´t handle them you don´t deserve your MUUH freedom.  Just like under friends you insult each other, you call them pussy, maybe womans get offendet? WHO CARES! People that get easy offendet are shitty people anyways. I realy like the niggers and sandniggers here, must suck to have such a complex relationship when you in murrica have black friends and are even afraid to rap the nigger part in a rap. But this is the magic land of murrica.    Are you intimidated by the fact that you can express your hate filled opinion online and in private but if you actually said it on the street to a black person they'd kick your ass?   No, because i don´t live in a third world country like america where you have to get afraid to get shoot. I mean you probably don´t even realize how stupid your argument is, this is like saying   YEAH you are against isis, but you wuldn´t go to isis and then allah sucks   I mean you see in the video what happens if you call a nigger nigger. They react like monkeys and beat you, and you are almost proud of this fact. Thats why america is a country i will never live in. Like the niggers and kebab in my country that understand jokes and irony, where you can say what you wan´t without the fear to get killed or beaten up.   Your view of the World is warped. I'm not telling you this so you'll be nice to black people. Just stating that you're just incorrect, bitter and stupid.   This has nothing to do with being nice to black people.  But yeah, clearly my world is wrapped, clearly.  Sorry for the bad english, no offense.  I don't see much future for the Americans ... it's a decayed country. And they have their racial problem, and the problem of social inequalities ... my feelings against Americanism are feelings of hatred and deep repugnance ... everything about the behaviour of American society reveals that it's half Judaised, and the other half negrified.

It was individuals who were enslaved not a race and almost everyone throughout history was subjugated by the ruling classes. People of all colours have been enslaved. I'm white but if my ancestors lived in a city in Victorian England they would have had horrible lives, living off of bread that's mostly made of saw dust, kids the age of five were sent down coal mines and shit like that. Im not sayin I deserve sympathy for what they went through , but because the people ruling them had the same skin colour im not offered it. I have sympathy for black people who are treated differently because of their skin colour today , not because of what their ancestors might have went through (not all black people are American and decendants of slaves)."

ITSAPRANK,2u8xrf,Natchil,2,Sat Jan 31 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"i don´t think its right..but..deserved it   It's like saying ""It's not right but it it is totally right""  and that's a bullshit statement if you ask me, because whoever says it is obviously convinced that it is right.  I'm saying it's not right, as a society we can't say who we can punch and who we can't on a whim, even if I feel they ""deserved it"" it shouldn't happen. I wouldn't encourage this behavior if I saw it, meaning I wouldn't be ""damn right, he called you nigger, of course you're entitled to punch him"". although I wouldn't encourage it overtly, I still might think that in a particular case someone deserved it. I hope..that..makes sense.  You make good points, by the way."

ITSAPRANK,2u8xrf,heyimpumpkin,-1,Sat Jan 31 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"kind of the most useless thing you could have posted right here. Most people in Russia are traditional and don't like gays. Orthodox church and it's authority also have a lot to do with this. The dude in the video on purpose goes up to the ones who are either Muslim or the ones who look aggressive to get this exact reaction. Again most people may not like gays but most won't be aggressive about it, he just does it speficially with wrong people to get the views.

ITSAPRANK,2u8xrf,Izzeheh,1 point,Sun Feb 1 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"Well there are 140mln+ people in Russia, that's the first thing. There is also a lot of dash cams and people with cameras. There is also no shortage of idiots, pretty big alcohol consumption and shitty ineffective police. Shitty police makes people rely on themselves in case something happens. Alcohol consumption makes these kind of situations to happen more frequently. So if American calls a police, Russian will settle situation himself. I guess that's a shock factor you get from watching it. To compare, try to imagine every encounter involving police in the US will be shot and you have those footages over the internet - there's gonna be a lot of scary stuff but you have in mind ""well that's police, dangerous job"".   I also believe most of the weird stuff happens in rural regions (which also drown average life expectancy and other important aspects of the whole country). Not saying rural regions are not important, but they are very different from cities in all aspects. There's no work there, so people who won't move just spend their time drinking. As you can imagine raising infrastructure in rural regions is immense job for a country with 17mln km2 territory, of which a lot has very tough natural condition.    Driving is another thing, and yes Russian driving culture is terrible as well as the roads condition, unfortunately.   And lastly, you see a lot of these things and none of any others, that's why you get this biased view that shit is totally fucked up here. In reality most of these things happen rarely.   I often see how people here like no, I'm never visiting Russia - but I'm sure if you go to Moscow/St.Petersburg you're gonna have a great time as a tourist. At least my foreign friends do. Funnily enough, many of them also enjoy exploring Far East, Sibirea and go to the parts of Russia I've never visited myself. Maybe it's fascinating for tourist in some way."

The paintball gun here is a 600-800$ gun that could easily be mistaken for a firearm by people with less knowledge about them.  However, when they go and start their ""prank"", they are using a standard paintball gun that is much less like a real firearm.  I wonder if that is because they were worried about it being confiscated or if they were worried about being shot?  Either way, this is illegal.  At the very very least it is disturbing the peace.  Too bad he didnt get shot.  Or damn near give someone a heart attack who calls the cops and they go to jail for it.  This guy is nothing but a fuckin cunt."

I know they really only targeted black males to get violent reactions, but thats still thier own damn fault for being so violent?  What a goofy fucking view......    Edit:  When you call shit racist that isnt, you look like a petty fucking piece of shit.  Nothing makes me sicker then hearing dumb trash claim racism of shit that has nothing to do with it.  You only hurt yourself and your race by making the people you are claiming racism about, resent you and your kind for being goofy.  Does no one remember the Michael Brown shooting?  Every one of those dumb fucks make me sick.  You want to truly take the power away (protections deserved by it) keep calling every little thing racist.  Just like the word Rape.  No one understand the severity of it anymore because its common fucking place to be racistly slightly by a fucking coffee barrister with 1 oz less of coffee, instead of the fucking massive injustice done to real people, with real fucking racism.

ITSAPRANK,2lwfu6,BiWinning85,-2,Sat Nov 15 04:58:28 2014 UTC,"Yes, but you are looking at it from the perspective that it is solely to disparage black people and make them look violent.  My point is, the violence pre exists, and they choose them to get the violent reaction.  Now,  I am a smart, 30 yr old (white) man, and can clearly tell the men reacting, are particularily violent for a few reasons.    They are young  They do violent jobs (drug dealing, thugging)  The environment around them is dangerous (I would react the same way)   I can tell, by taking 30 seconds to assess it, its not just ""All blacks are violent""  But thats what its being made out as right?  Good for you.  Go see the racism in EVERYTHING.  Its all made out to keep you down right?  Ill tell you a big secret.  White people are just as much fucked as the rest of you.  Its the rich that are sitting pretty, manipulating media, trying to turn the religions and races against each other and people are following.

He made no effort to push her off at all and I know hardly any of the others did either, but in his context (being on a date, with his gf etc) his reaction really ought to have been more immediate. Notice, he doesn't even look at the woman when she sits on him. And then when when his gf/date said ""you're still holding my hand..."" He just put his head in his hand and shook his head like a guilty man. And then when she asked who it is and he answered ""Nobody."" And not, ""I don't have a clue I've never met this woman in my life"" (Answerng 'nobody' to a question like that is the standard answer of somebody up to no good) Anyway I realised he is a guilty man, although not with this particular woman."

ITSAPRANK,2k6jyx,DogeSaint-Germain,-8,Mon Nov 3 01:17:20 2014 UTC,"That's just douchey from the kicker. ''Oh, I see a guy running away for some reason, let me just kick him right in the head and kill him''."
ITSAPRANK,2k6pc3,420braizeit,14,Fri Oct 24 10:55:50 2014 UTC,"I want to pull a prank, where should I go? I know! The inner city! The locations where violent crime rates are at their highest! Yeah! Pussy-ass white boys fucking around in the hood! There's no way this could go wrong!"
ITSAPRANK,2k6pc3,markswam,10,Fri Oct 24 16:31:12 2014 UTC,It's so satisfying to see these punks get put in their place every once in a while.
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,bobsharklol,10,Fri Oct 24 10:58:43 2014 UTC,"I'd love to see them explaining this to an officer  ""You are under arrest!""  ""But it was a prank!""  ""Everything you say..."""
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,TheBW,11,Fri Oct 24 12:08:04 2014 UTC,Solid right hook from Mr. Red Pants
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,aberen,3,Fri Oct 24 11:35:00 2014 UTC,"I really wanted him to hit him again after yelling ""ITSAPRANKITSAPRANKITSAPRANK"""
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,SullyKid,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:49:49 2014 UTC,I love how strategic that punch was. He waited until the exact moment when he could get that hit in.
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,tajjet,3,Sun Oct 26 01:39:03 2014 UTC,for context the victim was also in on this one.  it's still dumb though
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,Jdun,4,Fri Oct 24 13:56:39 2014 UTC,"Oh, I didn't notice, it's not as dumb as I first thought it was. Still not bright..."
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,Flapperpoo,3,Fri Oct 24 14:39:53 2014 UTC,That guys voice (the one that got punched) might be one of the most annoying things I've ever heard.
ITSAPRANK,2k6phd,sodelll,3,Fri Oct 24 14:54:40 2014 UTC,One of my all time favorites. Punch happens at 1:15.
