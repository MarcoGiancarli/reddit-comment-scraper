legaladvice,3e2qha,Snarky75,29,Tue Jul 21 16:07:12 2015 UTC,Something big is going on with Walgreens prescription system now.  I just tried to call in for a refill and was told their whole system is down - at every location.  I wonder if they were hacked and they shut it down to figure it out.
legaladvice,3e2qha,SerpentsDance,10,Tue Jul 21 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"A few months ago Walgreens somehow managed to attach some other person's information to my account. This woman lived in NYC and had the same name as me. I kept getting ""your prescription is ready for pickup"" calls on a prescription for a Walgreens in that city. I live in Kentucky. I called them and kept telling them it was not mine, and the pharmacist kept arguing with me. I think I'd know if I'd ever gone to NYC.   I finally got them to agree to remove that prescription from my account after spending a good 20 minutes on the phone arguing with them about it. Then I made them read through every prescription they had on record for me just to make sure there wasn't anything else that shouldn't have been there."
legaladvice,3e2qha,ChiliFlake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"I like the convenience of being able to refill prescriptions whether I'm in my state or my mom's state when I'm visiting. But I guess the downside to a nationwide database is that there will be screw-ups. (fortunately, I'm the only person in the US with my name)."
legaladvice,3e2qha,SerpentsDance,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"With me, my maiden name is just uncommon enough that in combination with my first name, there are only a few people with it. Unfortunately for me, that means anything that still has my maiden name attached to it runs the risk of other people's records being mixed up with mine. I went to a doctor a few years ago, once. There is a woman in the same state as me, who lives in a nearby city, with my name who went to that same doctor. One day I got an envelope from the doctor's office with a bunch of test results. They were not my test results. I had to call and get her medical records disentangled from mine at that office. It was a total pain in the ass. Since I've married things like that happen less frequently, but every so often I'll get something from an old doctor or car insurance company for someone with my first name and maiden name."

A covered entity also may leave a message with a family member or other person who answers the phone when the patient is not home. The Privacy Rule permits covered entities to disclose limited information to family members, friends, or other persons regarding an individual’s care, even when the individual is not present.    The general opinion seems to be that disclosing prescription information to family members is acceptable. If done maliciously, you may have legal recourse. It wouldn't hurt to consult a lawyer specializing in medical malpractice and/or HIPAA violations to take a look at your case (they typically work on contingency so the up-front cost should not be prohibitive). I'd be interested to know how they got the email info in the first place, it may have been an innocent mistake."
legaladvice,3e2qha,FoghornLawhorn,41,Tue Jul 21 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"IANAL but I do work in health care, and disclosing drug names and prescription numbers in such a message is far more information than necessary and I can't believe that would fall under ""limited information.""

legaladvice,3e2qha,ottawadeveloper,6,Tue Jul 21 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Even if it was just the RX number, its still a privacy breach. The fact that it listed the names of the meds and the dosages is just astounding.    I mean, it's not as if they got a notification that her inhaler that she has had her whole life needed to be refilled (that's an example). This is extremely sensitive information..."

legaladvice,3e2qha,awwwww_snap,6,Tue Jul 21 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"I get email and text notifications from Walgreens. If mine are the standard company policy, there should not have been more than 4 digits of the perscription number visible. It should have looked like this: XX1234-XXXXX. With no other medical information within the email.   Honestly, I am kind of doubting that the email the parents got was automated at all. The texts I get only send me a link to the website where I have to login in order to see any personal information. This is such a drastic difference between getting not only the entire perscription number, but also the medicines' names.  Definitely speak with that lawyer. Hopefully y'all can get a subpoena to get the email her parents got with the email address it was sent from. That would probably reveal if a real person had sent it."

If she does, that would explain why the email was sent to her parents, because that is the email on file.  I get those emails because I use Walgreens, and I have my email and scripts tied to my rewards card, so I get these emails when it's time to refill.  If she is, removing her scripts from the rewards account should prevent this from happening again."
legaladvice,3e2qha,AdultlikeGambino,3,Tue Jul 21 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"She only ever uses her own rewards account when picking up scripts. At this point, the damage is done. It doesn't even matter if it happens again."
legaladvice,3e2qha,AdultlikeGambino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:51 2015 UTC,Problem is that HIPAA law may allow for it. I just know I would follow the same standard practice because most people do not at all want to come close to violating HIPAA and do not even want the hassle of calling actions into question. I would really need to review the letter of the law.
legaladvice,3e2qha,pottersquash,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"Even if HIPAA allows for it, civil rights violation? Negligence? Emotional distress?"
legaladvice,3e2qha,pottersquash,3,Tue Jul 21 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"The ""emotional distress"" cause of action is usually used for intentional infliction of emotional distress - meaning the action was knowingly taken for the purpose of causing distress.  There is a negligent IED cause of action but in most places it's pretty flimsy"

legaladvice,3e2qha,SirBensalot,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:30 2015 UTC,"That does sound intensely traumatic and I don't mean to minimize that, just trying to give you some perspective on those potential causes of action.    Intentional infliction of emotional distress is probably not available unless there's some reason to believe the pharmacy disclosed the information with the intent of causing harm - which doesn't seem likely.  Negligent IED would seem to fit much better, but it is incredibly jurisdictional, widely disfavored for vagueness, and limited, and I don't personally know the nuances of the claim in Illinois.  That said, the elements (generally) are a duty, which was breached, and whose breach was the legal cause of the resulting harm.  Even though there isn't a private cause of action for HIPAA violations, I believe the statutory duty of nondisclosure should suffice for the duty element of a NIED claim.  The duty was fairly obviously breached, even if it was unintentional, and that breach did directly cause the harm that your partner has suffered/is suffering.  I'm not an IL plaintiff's lawyer, or an IL lawyer at all, but I'd strongly advise you to talk to one.  Unless IL has some weird quirks, I'd think NIED would at least be actionable.  There is probably a privacy-related claim in there too.  Check out the third case they discuss at the bottom of http://www.sedgwicklaw.com/Publications/detail.aspx?pub=4678 - it's not exactly analogous, but it discusses HIPAA-violating disclosures in a negligence context  As a practical matter, if you do want to pursue litigation, ask your partner to start keeping a journal detailing her feelings and emotional state and any events that take place like fights with the parents or physical symptoms (nausea, sickness, stress, jitteriness, sleep loss, depression, headaches, etc).  It sounds sort of silly, but it will help your attorney immensely.  These sorts of timelines - and I'd emphasize the physical symptoms - help to quantify damages (and I believe some jurisdictions actually require physical symptoms in a NIED case, although I could be wrong).  I'm really sorry yall are having to go through this, but it does sound actionable if you're interested in pursuing legal recourse.  I'd highly recommend hiring an attorney.  Good luck to you both"

legaladvice,3e2qha,PM-Me-Beer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:36 2015 UTC,There is no private right of action under HIPAA. Your state may have more protective laws or recognize a right to privacy concerning this information.
legaladvice,3e2qha,macimom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Those are good questions and I hope the lawyers you'll speak with can tell ya. I can see an emotional distress case, but those can be hard to prove because they are rather subjective. As for a negligence case, that would also be a battle where Walgreens argues automation can not involve negligence. I don't know what precedent there is in those cases and how much the plaintiff would have to argue, but it sounds possible.  I AM NOT A LAWYER, so that is not meant to be legal advice. All your thoughts and concerns should be brought to a lawyer."

legaladvice,3e2qha,pottersquash,17,Tue Jul 21 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"If you do contact a lawyer about this then it would be good to ask if what /u/PM-Me-Beer quoted applies to emails that weren't even directed towards you.

I am not a child and that is no one's business but my own.  That being said, I know that sometimes my mom fills my prescriptions for me (for things like painkillers after surgery or when I am very sick and can't make it to the pharmacy on my own).  As long as you have the name of the patient, the birthdate, and money for the copay, you can pretty much pick up anyone's prescription.

My mother is estranged from her brother (they are 60's and 70's respectively). She heard from a cousin that the brother (my uncle) went to the ER for an emergency and had a followup appointment with a specialist.  A couple of days later, my mother got a robo-voicemail from a doctor's office confirming [Brother's name][Family last name]'s appointment.  We have no idea at all how the doctor's office got my mother's cellphone number (she had never been to this doctor), or why it had been attached to her brother's appointment. My uncle does not know my mom's cellphone number (only a handful of people do).   She called the doctor's office and was told it was an automated call, but they couldn't give any more info than that (HIPPA, etc).  The only clues we have is that they're both in the same hospital network (there's only one in the area they live), they both have the same sort of uncommon last name, and the hospital forwarded uncle's records to the doctor's office after the ER trip.  It's so bizarre. But it was clearly a mixup, since there was no ill-intent for my mom's situation. So maybe, somehow, it was a mixup for OP too. But it's still really strange."

legaladvice,3e2rm6,swalsh411,10,Tue Jul 21 15:00:01 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that it states in your lease that your landlord pays those two utilities for you.   If you have available funds, you should pay the water bill yourself. You then should send a certified letter demanding repayment for the utilities which you paid for. Otherwise, not having water would definitely deem the place uninhabitable and allow you to break your lease. To not go through all of that trouble, though, I'd suggest if you're financially able to pay the water bill and seek compensation."

Have you tried talking to the other tenants in the building about the bill? I assume it's decently substantial if it's the water bill for four units.   Unfortunately the water company won't care if it is your obligation or your landlords obligation. If the bill has been unpaid for a few months now, they're going to shut off the water regardless. If you can't stay with friends, or find a way to pay for the bill, I don't know what recourse you'd have besides living without water while you attempt to rectify this situation. Luckily, you do have a week and will be gone for a few days while the water is shut off. You should talk to the other tenants or attempt to continue to contact the landlord."

However, if you do pay the bill, don't expect the LL to be able to reimburse you anytime soon.  You may be able to get together with the other tenants, and get a lawyer to draft a letter to the LL that you will assume paying the bills (ideally split equally four ways, but you can make changes as needed for your situation) BUT that you will deduct it from your rent payments every month (with a copy of the water bill for him to verify the deduction). That way, nobody loses any money and you don't have to come after the LL for payment later.  If at all possible, get the LL's signature on some sort of agreement to this effect.  Also, if any other utilities are unpaid, you could do the same with them.  Lastly, this is likely a temporary solution as the LL may soon default on other bills and obligations and could go into bankruptcy, so start looking for another place soon."

The landlord cannot cause the removal or shutoff of the utilities except for a temporary period during repair or emergencies. In cases when a landlord’s account is about to be shut off for non-payment, the utility company must notify you 30 days before the scheduled termination. You also may be asked to pay part of the overdue bill to the utility, and deduct that payment from your rent. Contact the Department of Public Utilities at 1-800-392- 6066 for more information (M.G.L. c. 164, § 124A-I)  You're kind of getting screwed here.  If the LL doesn't respond, your only recourse is to contact the Util and probably do the partial payment to retain service, then like it says, deduct it from your next rent payment.  If the LL starts or threatens an eviction action, retain further legal counsel (the Boston Tenant Association may be of some help).  You may need to sue or allow the eviction to go to court, where your LL will certainly lose.  I don't know Mass law, but if it's anything like Ohio's you may be entitled to damages above repayment."

If the policy change was required by the payroll company, then the payroll company will be interested in the fact that the pizza chain is screwing things up by not distributing the new policy to employees. So the pizza chain might get their act together if the payroll company gets on their case about it.  I don't see how something can be a policy if you were never notified of it. It sounds like you're keeping careful records of everything, which is good. Keep doing that, and try to put all communications in writing, in case you need it later. If you meet with someone, send an email afterwards, ""As we discussed in our meeting today . . ."" For now, maybe send an email to HR like, ""As you know, on [date] I was informed of our vacation policy, a copy of which is posted on our intranet at [address]. This says that I have [x] days, and that general managers receive an additional week of vacation days. On [date] I was promoted to general manager, and accordingly should now have [x] days, of which I've used [y]. I understand that a new policy is being worked on but is not finalized for distribution. Accordingly, until such time as a new policy has been finalized and distributed, I am assuming that I still have [x] days."" See what they come back with. If they say you're wrong, ask them to put that in writing.  Unfortunately it looks like the federal and OH state labor departments don't help with claims about vacation days (as they're mostly concerned with making sure people get minimum wage for the hours they work), but worst case scenario, you could probably take your employer to small claims court if they owe you for the missing vacation days.

When from another point of view, don't police departments do whatever they can to protect their own, as well as avoid public outrage as much as possible? Why wouldn't they do the same for you here?

That's ok because I still love him to pieces.   Even with all the time he's spent in the hospital and all the time he's spend at home relying on me 100%,  I still love him. Would I rather that he were well and back on the job with HPD (he was a cop for 10 years and loved nearly every second of it)? Hell yes. But oddly enough I'd rather take him like he is than lose him altogether.  We are very lucky in that he gets 25% of his pay as disability pay and is insured through the union so that's a few less things to worry about - others have said to talk to your union - this is another reason to do it.   My husband has told me more than once that I would be better off with out him. That's the only time we fight because he's fucking wrong - I would not be better off without him.   Your situation is different (aren't they all) but don't start thinking for your wife without actually talking to her. Don't think you know her better than she knows herself, either.   Unless there is something going on in your marriage, then your wife wants you with her for as long as she can have you. She needs you to be there for as long as you can be. That's a burden on you - we as wives know it is and frequently feel guilty for sticking it on you.  She needs to go with you to your doctor's appointments. Even when you guys are other wise well, y'all can't remember shit after going to the doctor's office.   I'm now going to give you advice that I don't follow (and should).

legaladvice,3e04iv,mcx9099,32,Mon Jul 20 23:08:07 2015 UTC,"I have not looked through the other answers so there may be some overlap.  I am a lawyer in Illinois.  Your legal competency as a witness is now in question. Witness competency is teh ability to observe recall and recite under oath. Cases where you are the sole or key witness will need to be reexamined by the local state's attorney to determine if they have enough evidence to proceed without you. In this respect it is the same as if ,say, you had a stroke and couldn't talk any more.  Since you are in a rural county, I assume there are more instances where you are teh only officer on teh case, so that might prove a problem with some prosecutions.   On the other hand, you have been trained in doing things as a routine and it is fair for you personally to rely on the fact that you followed routine. Maintaining chain of  custody of evidence would be a big one.  There are some treatments which slow the  development of the dementia. Make sure you get to a good teaching hospital for a thorogh evaluation. Your state university medical school is a good resource. Also, if you have had any duty related head injuries you want to get an opinion whether that aggravated or accelerated your condition.  If you are the top offer in your county, I suggest you talk to a lawyer in another county and considering approaching your state's attorney first before you resign to allow him to plan. WE always appreciate lead notice. there may be things you can do and should do before you resign as well.  For yourself, you will need to apply for your disability pension and get some input whether there is any duty disability or work comp available to you. While you can, choose who will be making your medical and legal decisions for you when you can no longer do so. If you are still functional there are things to do to plan for when you qualify for Social Security Disability (  Some public officers don't participate in that system). SSI /Medicaid pays for nursing homes; Medicare does not. there are ways to fashion things so you have  a place to be and someone to take care of you.  Regardless, if you have  made mistakes, you can't change them ; the state's attorney will know how to mitigate.  And figure out what you will do with yourself after you resign. A plan and reliance on the plan will be your saving grace.  You have been dealt a rough hand ."

legaladvice,3e04iv,EthnographyHomework,12,Mon Jul 20 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"tl;dr since one wasn't provided: Sheriff has learned that he's had undiagnosed Alzheimer's for a while, and is worried he may have messed up some cases.  IANAL, but I think the gist of the following is correct even if the details aren't.  Keep in mind, Sheriff, that you're part of a justice system that's much larger than just yourself. If your reports and testimony aren't as reliable as they thought, your DA should notify any defendants, and the defendants can bring it up in court. Judges and juries can consider (or re-consider) your testimony in light of your memory issues and make the right decisions. It's no different than if you witnessed a crime on a foggy night and couldn't see all the details, or your dash cam was broken and there's no video of a stop.  If anyone feels wronged by your faulty memory, they're more likely to sue your department for failing to notice your medical issues than they are to sue you personally—your department has more money to pay them in restitution. Even if they do sue you personally, I believe that your department has already indemnified you, and it's basically their problem; if not, your union is there to help you. Anyone who has suffered will get whatever restitution they're entitled to receive, and your family will be fine.  The point is, once you've made sure the appropriate parties know about your concerns, it's their job to take care of the details. Your job right now is to focus on your family and your health.  Nobody would blame you if a suspect got away, or was injured, because you had a stroke mid-pursuit; nobody will blame you if a disease you couldn't control or detect influenced your judgement on the job, either. No disease can undo the years of good service you've put in. Retire with pride in all you've done for your community."

You are the kind of law enforcement officer I want on the streets. You are the kind of officer that gives me faith that not all cops are bad, and some honestly do just want to help serve the community in the best way possible. I am thankful that you've spent your whole life doing this, because I am sure along the way you have helped so many lives. I cannot say I understand your situation, as I am not in your shoes. I can say, however, that I want you to remain strong in the face of this disease. You may not be able to beat it, but you sure as hell can fight it for as long as possible. Amazing things have been done before with an iron will. There are medicines that can slow progression, brain exercises that can slow progression, lifestyle changes that can help hold it off for as long as possible. I do sincerely hope you use everything in your power to fight this; the world needs more caring people such as yourself. Find a support group. Do not be afraid to reach out to others. If the community supports you, which you have already stated, find comfort in the fact that you have served your community well during your time as an officer. If you feel you need it, don't be ashamed to see a psychiatrist or a counselor of some sort. Don't be scared to lean on your wife for support. You've got nothing but support around you, take advantage of it. Looking for help does not mean you are weak. It is not something to be ashamed of. Keep your loved ones close, cherish every moment you get with them. Make as many memories now as you can, and try and hold on to them as long as possible. Most of all, don't ever give up fighting this thing. Stay strong, and have faith in the little things. Be proud of what you have done for your community during your years of service.

Still they admitted that I had one quarter more than I needed, over 13 years after I was almost killed by a drunk driver. I would have qualified for a parents disability if the accident had happened a few months earlier. And no you really can't live on $733 a month in a major city, and the medical care I depend on means living in a major city. I know others in the disabled community on SSI and they all work under the table at something.

My heart goes out to you, to your loved ones, and I wish you the brightest mornings and clearest days possible in the days ahead.   The mind is flexible and strong, and the spirit is very strong inside of the mind. Stay as clear as you can, and treasure every day. Life is precious, and day by day, it will be all right. It's all right.  We have all made grave mistakes in our lives and sometimes in the moment, it's hard to make the right choice even for the most solid of men. We do the best we can. Be at rest in the fact that you did the best you could, like any man does, in the heat of the moment. In the end everything will be clear, and everything will be forgiven.  Be well, be safe, embrace the time you have and I'm so sorry this has come on you. Let the past go, nothing can be done about the past. You did the best you could. God bless you."

legaladvice,3e04iv,MuhammadTheProfit,4,Tue Jul 21 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Ouch! There is little I can add to what others have posted except: A friend of mine's mother went blind, was hard of hearing, and then developed dementia. He and his dad did an 8 hour shift each, as caregivers seven days a week, in addition to the nurses who also did a shift. This experience led to a career training nursing home staff, in how to better care for dementia patients. Here is some of his better ideas for what they are worth:  As one looses their memory, their most recent memories are usually lost first. So older pictures of friends and family are helpful, as is older possessions, furniture, and music. So rather than getting rid of all your old stuff, keep your older prized possessions that will make the process more comfortable. Pick out the things that have memories, and make it clear to your family that you want them for the journey home. That could be an ipod full of your favorite oldies, that lamp that you had since you were a young adult, that picture of you in uniform when you were first sworn in as a LEO, a photo album organized by date, with the oldest pictures in the front, and with names, events and years written in, etc.   And thank you for choosing to Protect and Serve. Once after a habitual drunk driver left me with a broken back and in a coma, in the middle of nowhere in a hit and run, a LEO saved my live. I suspect that you have done the same for others, please focus on those incidents, and not what you might, or might not have done, before you understood that you beginning to lose it. Please take care."

On the other hand, if you are not in a strong position at work already, I will almost certainly get you fired. Only you can tell whether this is a chance worth taking.  In my case, when the time came for lay offs a year later. The first ones to go were the coworkers who never put up a fight. I actually never got laid off and eventually quit by myself, as they didn't have any work assigned to me for a few months and I found a better job somewhere else.  In other words.

Unfortunately, you can't make them give you paid medical benefits. Apply for ACA medical insurance if it's cheaper/better than the policy you can buy through them or through the private market.

You might want to tell the IRS approximately how many people they have working at your location.  Employers can fire W2 employees willy-nilly too, so that's a silly excuse. Anyone they fire can and should apply for unemployment compensation since they've been misclassified. I'm surprised a university is being this stupid."

I would think a threat to let the fans at them would qualify as embarrassment, ridicule & harassment. Look at what the fans of One Direction did to that girl that was knocked up. Death threats, harassment, slash sites, etc & they didn't even have her full information.  Obviously a TV show example, but Ed Sheeran was playing himself on Undatable & was offended by being told to stop playing by the bar owner.

I would think a threat to let the fans at them would qualify as embarrassment, ridicule & harassment.    No, the threat in that case would be to have their fans harass the person, which is only peripherally related to the personal information.  Again there may be criminal statutes on point, depending on what state you're in, but it's probably not extortion.   You're missing the key point that the release of publicly available information is not, in itself, embarrassing or otherwise within the intent of an extortion statute.

I was asked by a traveling friend to drop of rent for her while she was out of town. I have done this in the past as she is a long time tenant and travels frequently.  The location with the rent drop box is within one of the apt. complex's buildings, and working long hours, the three attempts I made to drop off rent at the end of June all encountered a locked door.   This has always been the method for dropping off rent, so unable to reach my traveling friend, I looked up the mailing address of the management company and mailed the check.   Management emailed the tenant on July 8th saying no check had been received and they were looking for her, and that a 5% late fee was also now necessary. I mailed both a new check and the fee.  On July 10th a letter showed up on the door of the apartment with the first check included saying they could not deposit due to the ""eviction procedures"" in place.  In subsequent phone calls with management, they claim to have left a 3 day or quit notice. We never found this on the door or mail box. They also claim the rent check (original) was postmarked July 6th. I'm guessing they can back this claim with an envelope.  Lawyers, $1k for an answer (assuming an unlawful detainer gets served) $10k for a trial.  Both these numbers are far and beyond her budget.

So, for all I know I'm completely wrong.  In the US, bank accounts are treated similarly to how real estate works... Basically, the interests of the states trump any convinence you might have hoped for. The proper procedure is to begin an ancillary proceeding in the proper state, have a judge there sign off on the executor as well. IIRC the executor need not be in the US, but the executor is going to have to at least have an attorney in the US in most jurisdictions, especially for large dollar amounts. I do believe that a few states have small estate procedures. In fact, if the executor is not an individual I'm nearly positive you absolutely have to have an attorney.  If you're not sure where to begin... I'd probably call an estate attorney in Charlotte, North Carolina because I believe that's where Bank of America is headquartered. That might not be completely correct, but that's where I would start if I were in your position."

It's a pretty sizeable estate, and I know that most banks require you to appear in person (or an attorney) to close an account.   The issue is that the bank won't honor anything BUT a USA appointment, and the asset is part of an estate outside of this Court's jurisdiction.  An ancillary proceedings (at least in this state) just takes in the exemplified proceedings from the foreign jurisdiction and puts them on the record in this state.  There's also publication for creditors, and a small court fee, but that's it.  No appointment by this court, no letters testamentary issued by this court."

What you have there is an acceleration clause, and some states have held those clauses to be unconscionable because of what I posted above.    You may to consult with a lawyer in the state with the lease to find out exactly what the case law in your area is.  Since these are principles of common law this is not likely to be covered by statutes, you will need a lawyer to check past cases.

I am not in legal trouble but rather I saw something whilst signing up to a forum which made me curious to whether it was actually a legally binding contract.  I was signing up to a forum which focuses on online gaming MMOs where you can buy/sell gold, accounts, services etc  When you make an account it has a bit of info saying if you scam other members on the forum you are liable to pay back what you scammed to that person and also to the website and any reasonable amount of interest on it.  Surely just because you say yes that doesn't make it legally binding? Or does it?  Note - I am not asking because my intentions are to do that, I just found it quite peculiar and wondered whether they put that as a method to try and deter scammers knowing they can't actually enforce it."

You do realize that probation is the alternative the state gives you to jail or prison, right?  In return for being allowed to stay out of custody, you surrender certain rights while on probation.    Among those rights you surrender are some of your fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant or probable cause.  The bottom line is that while you're on probation, your PO can search you, your car, your personal belongings, your backpack, your laptop bag, your laptop (probably), your phone, and, yes, your home (wherever it is).    There is some protection for your roommate - your PO likely can't search anything in his part of the room, such as his closet, his backpack, his clothes, etc.    But yeah, your PO can search your room pretty much whenever your PO wants.  Don't like that?  There's a good incentive to finish your probation and never put yourself in that position again."

It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post.  Please update the original post to include this information.    Report Inaccuracies Here | Author    Original Post:  Alberta, CAN: Trying to locate contents of foreclosed home   My mother's house was foreclosed on last year.   She now lives in a nursing home, but in the past had taken out a CHIP home equity loan. She was moved suddenly into the nursing home due to injury, leaving the house vacant. She didn't realize that defaulted on the terms of the loan, thus the foreclosure.   Due to circumstances, we were unable to remove all the contents of the home. However, I (POA) was told at the time by the bank representative that any personal effects would be moved into storage and the costs thereof would be deducted from the sale proceeds.   I kept up with the process as it went on, and was advised everything was proceeding by the book and was given copies of all the legal documents and purchase offers, from both the bank and their lawyer. It seemed straightforward and we weren't fighting the foreclosure, so we didn't retain a lawyer at the time.   About three months ago, I received a letter telling me the foreclosure was completed, along with a statement of costs. In that statement was an invoice stating that 'all contents' were taken to the dump for disposal.   This invoice was dated last September, at which time I was talking regularly with the bank rep. At (and after!) that time, I was told that nothing had happened yet and that the foreclosure process was delayed due to a change in property management companies. That statement was the first update I ever got on the contents.   I've since been in contact with the bank, property management company, and bank's lawyer, and nobody is giving me any information. They say they'll look into it but nothing ever comes of that.   So what now? Looking into it, I've been told that normally the contents are stored or auctioned off, unless they're worth less than $500, in which case they're disposed of. Also, that they need to have an inventory of the contents and appraised value. I've requested this specifically from the lawyer, but no dice. In this case, there's no way the contents were worth less than that amount, as the contents were almost completely untouched from when the house was occupied."

legaladvice,3e2sko,farmwife,8,Tue Jul 21 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"First get an estimate from another contractor to complete the work and find out how much that will cost. No matter what, you cannot use this guy as he has already proven himself incompetent. Whether you sue him or not is you and your husband's business, but keep in mind that this was not some tiny mistake he made. It sounds like he had no idea what he was doing and accepted a job he knew he wasn't qualified for to try and make a quick buck at your expense. The fact that he CAN'T finish the work, even doing a shitty job, says something scary.  You have some things to figure out. Do you want to get this resolved, or do you want to have given him and his family a very nice gift? If you want to get it resolved, I see two choices:  1) Suing him: This is probably not the best bet. It will be annoying, and collecting will be difficult. If he doesn't have money, there's nothing to collect, and this will just sour relations. Use a lawsuit as an absolute last resort.  2) Make demands: Send him a strongly worded note (there are plenty of sample demand letters online that will give you a good start) that he needs to provide a refund. Have your estimate from another contractor in hand. Tell him it is your preference to settle this without involving authorities or courts, but that he needs to show some good faith.  It's a crappy position to be in. If he doesn't comply, don't hesitate to sue him. Being poor and having a family doesn't give him license to completely rip people off. It's as if you told someone you could rebuild the transmission on their car, took a $2,000 payment for it, then realized you don't know anything about transmissions but didn't give the money back. You can't pull that sort of shit and not expect to face the consequences. But if someone needs $2,000 in a pinch, they might just do it anyway.  Next time don't hire someone who isn't well established with plenty of references for the specific job you are doing."

My 2 cents:  I would send him a letter listing the problems, and saying you will give him one chance to fix them before filing suit.  Give him a deadline in writing.  Edit:  Normally if a contractor underbids a job, tough luck on them.  But if this contractor is truly someone who you feel strongly is a good person or is in your social circle, and you don't want to hurt them financially, maybe you volunteer to increase your payment (after he fixes everything of course).  Not increased to cover the cost of fixing his screwups, but increased to acknowledge the job was bigger or more complex than he understood when he bid it.

When she started working for them they gave her a company car (because her job involves covering a crazy amount of miles)   Now she's resigned, her manager has said that she must pay off the depreciation on a brand new audi a3 to the tune of about £2000  This was never outlined to her at any point and she never went to an office or signed anything regarding the car.   The company insists it uses e-mail as legal consent which even if that was legal was never outlined.   All help and information is greatly appreciated."

So if you do the declaration route, you can hope the officer doesn't submit his. Usually this requires full pre-payment.  You may be better off checking in to the court in the AM to see the judge. You can enter a guilty plea and request traffic school. But depending on the judge's mood and his/her feeling on speeding you may be able to get the fine reduced a bit AND get a payment plan.  If he/she lets you, quickly state that you're a student. It could be a crap shoot, but at the very least, get that payment plan going so you aren't strapped to pay the fine."

Additionally, i don't think i was going 75, probably more like 65-70, but I have no way to prove it. It's he said/ she said, so the cop wins.

That would be rare if you say you were going slower based on anecdotal evidence and the police officer used technology and his familiarity of speed.   Your best bet to get a reduction in your fine is to see the judge in person, hat in hand and politely request it.  They arbitrarily decide when and if to do that. If you have a clean record, that helps you.  California, however, levies a lot of court costs for budgetary reasons so there is a limit to how low they can go.   But it doesn't hurt to ask.

However, it may not hurt to go to court and explain your situation to the judge.  I wouldn't emphasize the ""no one was on the road so no one was in danger"" part, but judges do have some leeway with traffic fines, so your situation, and the fact that the highway may have changed speed limits recently might - might - help a little.  But it's not a high percentage play. Still, often just showing up and having any explanation can result in at least a small reduction in the fine, so long as you're respectful to the judge and coherent in what you say.   You need to weight a traffic court appearance against what it may cost you to miss work/school/whatever, cost of parking, cost of gas, etc.    If you can do traffic school (and, again, the cost of that won't be an alternative penalty), that may be your best bet."

It'll even out once you have a catalog and spread it out over dozens or hundreds of films, but until then it's one of those unavoidable things that you just have to eat.  You just need to factor it into your business plan and maybe scare up some extra start up money from somewhere.  Adult entertainment isn't as profitable as one might assume due to health care costs and legal fees, so it's very important to figure out how many customers and how many videos are necessary before starting up.

Don't forget to include your own costs in there, pay yourself what you need and use any revenue over and above costs to reinvest into the next project.

I dont do a lot of family law but I do not believe this is a tranmutation:  A transmutation agreement is a postnuptial agreement that changes the character of the spouses' property from community to separate, or vice versa. It may be used to change the character of property to be acquired in the future, as well as property that the spouses own at the time of the agreement.  My understanding is that when you inherit something during marriage and you want to keep it as separate property, different rules apply.  It  needs to be held separately (only her name on the title), she had no intention of it being communal property, she did not use any communal assets to improve the property(If they used joint money to pay property taxes or do repairs on the property, he would have a claim as community property).

legaladvice,3e25ns,FullBeardchew,8,Tue Jul 21 11:17:58 2015 UTC,Your narrative is a bit unclear.  Is this a business rental?  A residential one?  Both?  How is your lease structured?
legaladvice,3e25ns,thepatman,3,Tue Jul 21 11:22:47 2015 UTC,Well it is both. We were allowed to live there while we set up our non-profit and worked toward getting it financed. We were also supposed to have a written agreement with him to host some events there for him(he runs a wedding chapel). But he never put anything in writing. With everything that is wrong with the place we could not find financing or insurance. The board of my nonprofit decided not to pursue purchasing it. I would be happy to honor my agreement to stay there if there were not so many health risk that keep piling up.
legaladvice,3e25ns,thepatman,5,Tue Jul 21 11:43:22 2015 UTC,"OK, but how is the lease structured?  Is it written as a business lease, or a residential lease, or both?  Do you even have a lease?  You say you don't have a written agreement.    If there is a lease, what does it say about your ability to terminate?  Under what conditions?  How much longer does it last?"
legaladvice,3e25ns,Funderpants,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:51 2015 UTC,It is a structured as a residential lease. He did leave a clause that we would be meeting back in January to write up an agreement to host events. He never did so. I believe he was only hoping to get us to purchase it. His tone has changed dramatically since finding out the board will not be purchasing it.   We are stuck there until Dec. I do not have the lease in front of me right now. I will look at it when I get home on the termination portion.

The other issues, even if the building is ""grandfathered"" in would most likely still pose a health and safety issue and he needs to conduct repairs. Document the issues, go down to the courthouse and proceed with a notice to terminate the lease (I'm not sure which state you're in, they all have different names). You could also have a city/county building inspector check the place out.   A landlord will usually be given a time to cure the problems, if all these problems are as serious as you say and owner wants to sell, I doubt they're going to dump thousands into repairs. Between the roof and asbestos alone, he could be looking at some serious coin."

A picture of a leaky roof is pretty easy to take for documentation, if it's been leaky for a while and to the point mosquito breeding pools, there's probably some mold issues too.

They're saying I signed up for a 3 year contract for home security when I know I signed a 2 year contract. Problem is that I have lost my copies of the contract. I've had them send me what proof they had of the contract and it's pretty fishy. They sent me 5 papers with only 1 of them talking about a 36 month term. But it's below my signature, so it seems like they added it or there's a lost page. I'm here at the store now and it's not getting anywhere since they say they aren't privy to legal shit.

I signed for the installation services and i signed for the right to cancel. Both sections have no mention of the length.

Sadly, I'm not aware of any particular airlines that are better than others in regards to disability needs or service animals. It often comes down to how good the gate agents and air crew are trained. You may want to call a few airlines to get their specific policies. My understanding is that animals in training are treated the same as full trained animals but I wouldn't be surprised if policies vary or the language used is obtuse.   I walk with a mobility device often and typically get boarded on the plane first to avoid the crush of humanity and slowing down the process but I've run into instances where airlines that normally give me no trouble make a stink because I don't have a doctor's note or some type of advance notice (cough cough Southwest)."

Report Inaccuracies Here | Author    Original Post:  Got into my first car accident, very minor, hardly noticeable damage to both cars, but now the other guy is claiming injury 2 days later. Need advice.   So i was driving to work one morning, and had just gotten off an exit on one highway to another and was looking to merge into the next lane. I look ahead and there is no one in front of me, so I glance down into my side view mirror and when I look back, right as I've reached the first exit, there is another car immediately in front of me, breaking to a speed they should have once on the exit ramp. I am going around 50 mph, and have enough time to break for about a second before I hit into the back of him. Wasn't a very hard contact, but enough that the cars clearly connected.   We both get out of the car, and I ask him if he's alright.The other guy, the only person in his car had such a debilitating stutter that he couldn't form a complete sentence even given a minute or two but he manages to say that he is fine. I give him my information and he informs me that he can't give me any information as the car is not his but his friends. I inspect the car and see very little visible damage. A slight imprint of my license plate frame and that's it. My car only had the license plate frame slightly jarred and some paint cracked, like I said very minor damage. He also asked for cash to fix the damage which of course I refused, and made me wary of dealing with him much further myself.  Because this was my first accident I didn't know what information to get, and I had such a difficult time getting any information from him, I suggested exchanging phone numbers so we could more easily exchange details, and then because the accident and damage was so minor I didn't think that the police needed to be involved. At the end he also asked for cash to fix the damage which of course I refused, and made me wary of dealing with him much further myself. Also I was late to work, so we agreed to get in touch later. I now realize that was the wrong move and a cop should have been called regardless.  When I got home I called the police to ask for advice and they told me to get his name and insurance, and license info, provide it to my insurance company and do nothing else.   Later that day we exchanged registration and insurance information, but he was insisting on getting my address for the insurance company which I later found out was in an attempt to file a claim with my insurance company, which I refused to give him informing him what the police had told me, and that all that he would need is my name, registration # and insurance company. He continued to press me for the address and policy # which I did not want to give him and got his friend the owner of the car involved as well. At this point I ceased responding to them while they sent angry texts to me saying that it was all my fault, that they were not going to pay for something that I did, and I did not respond.   Now this morning I got in touch with our companies claims adjustor, and after explaining my side of the story, he told me that he had talked with the other driver and who had said that he was now experiencing chest and head pain, which I don't believe for a second.  First this guy asked me for cash at the scene of the accident, and now he's claiming that he has injuries from an accident with almost no damage to either car, which did not even cause the airbags to go off, and which frankly was a lot smoother than any of the rollercoasters I went on at six flags last week. I think he's trying to commit insurance fraud and this being my first ever experience with this sort of thing, I don't know what I should do. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Registered trademarks are the ones that show up at the USPTO website.  If a company whose market overlaps your market, and whose products or services are in your category of products or services, is already doing business under the name ""Super Food"", then they probably already have a common-law trademark for the name ""Super Food"" even though they have not registered the trademark.  If you were to start doing business with that name, then they could sue you for infringement.    Note that ""Dead"" in the USPTO database doesn't mean it's no longer a trademark.  It means the trademark is no longer registered.  It could still be in use and you could still lose a trademark infringement suit if you were to do business under that name.  To guard against this, you should do a trademark search to try to guarantee to the best of your ability that no company in your line of work uses that name.  Nolo has some books covering trademarks, and here's a link of theirs that should be useful.

Report Inaccuracies Here | Author    Original Post:  I don't know what else to do about my neighbor harassing me.   TLDR; Neighbor was infatuated with me, I told him to stop contacting me, he acts like everything is fine and is starting to creep again. I apologize for the wall of text but appreciate it very much if you stick around to read the entire post. Almost 3 years ago, my gf (now wife) and I met our neighbor because he was borrowing our internet. He was super friendly and we all chatted for a little while about WoW. A few days later, he requested me as a friend on FB. I was a little weirded out because he only added me and not my gf. I accepted it thinking he was just being friendly. Right off the bat, he would message me around 5am when my gf would leave for work. I was lonely and had no other friends in the area since I moved here out of state so I went along with it and talked to him. He would IM me as soon as I'd wake up and would stop after my gf got home from work. We shared a wall with him (he was in the apartment right next to ours) so I assumed maybe he just heard me walking around or something. Soon enough he became infatuated with me. He ended up buying me a pet on WoW that cost around $200 (Frosty from the WOLTK Collector's addition) even though I told him over and over again not to and that I would not be comfortable accepting it. After he did this, things just continued to get weird between us and I got more and more distant. There were several instances where he would make inappropriate comments like ""you wanna hook up?"" and when I got mad at him and blocked him, he said some retarded excuse like, ""I meant as friends lol aka hang out"" I never once led him on and continued to tell him I wasn't interested and I was in a committed relationship with my gf. He never acknowledged this. Despite all of the other stuff he did that I left out, the final straw was when he bought an $80 flower bouquet and sent it to my apartment with a message that said ""just cause. :)"" I called the flower company and they gave me his name when I asked who sent them. I threw them in the trash which was right in front of our apartment so he could see them and I sent him a text telling him that if he contacted me again, I was going to call the police. He didn't reply for a little while but then would send me a random message out of the blue with a friendly emote. I can't remember if I replied at all or not since this was so long ago. A few months back, he created a random Skype account and was messaging me on there. I had no idea it was him at first but after he wouldn't tell me who he was other than ""someone you traded with on WoW"" I got suspicious and removed him after a few days. Immediately when I removed him, he messaged me saying ""aww why did you remove me?"" and I replied saying, ""to be honest I don't remember who you are. sorry."" and he wouldn't stop trying to re add me. Finally I ignored his requests and left his IM open in the pending section. Low and behold a few weeks later, he changes his profile picture to his face and then I knew it was definitely him and not some ""random person I met on WoW"" and he was using that as a ploy to find out information about me. He asked where I was working, how I was doing, how my pet was doing, etc. I made the mistake of not reporting him to the police sooner so nothing came from any of this. My gf and I moved into a different apartment (owned by the same landlord but is a different building than the one I was in before). We have a porch now and it's just a lot more open than our previous place. We've seen him outside a few times and he tries to make conversation and he's friendly, etc. but I never make it a point to talk to him. He doesn't act as though I threatened him with the police a few years back which is very unsettling to me. A few nights ago, my neighbor/friend who lives above us was out on her porch smoking when she heard movement below. She looked over her railing and saw him stepping onto the concrete and then he walked away. She said it looked as if he was stepping down from our porch. He was standing only a few feet away from our door when he stepped down onto the sidewalk. I went outside and he wasn't around when I went out but when I saw him, I confronted him and told him to stay away from our house (only with more yelling and cursing.) He immediately got defensive and was trying to show me where he was sitting. I told him I didn't care and to stay away. I didn't realize until later that where he was standing, he had a clear view right into our kitchen. Who knows how long he was standing there for, just staring into our house. This whole situation is so frustrating and unsettling and I don't know what else to do. We contacted the police the day after it happened and they told us they have his name on record from 2011 (I'm not sure why, it isn't related to me though). They said there's really nothing they can do since he didn't physically do anything to us, I guess? And they suggested getting a ""no contact request"" from our landlords. We've called and emailed them but they have yet to get back to us which is upsetting. He has never tried to do anything to me but we really don't know what he's capable of. My gf and I are planning on keeping the blinds to the kitchen closed and/or getting a motion detected light for the porch. Does anyone have any kind of experience with this sort of stuff? I'm at a loss here."

That's not quite accurate. It's the employer's burden to understand FMLA and proactively help the employee with FMLA when a qualifying leave is needed. The employee does not need to even know the name of the program to qualify. See FMLA faq from the DOL [PDF warning].   When an employee seeks leave for a FMLA-qualifying reason for the first time, the employee need not expressly assert FMLA rights or even mention the FMLA.   If the employer needs certain documentation for FMLA approval, they must proactively guide the employee and given them sufficient time to fill out any paperwork."

Report Inaccuracies Here | Author    Original Post:  My wife is being denied group health coverage under FMLA because of ""job restructuring"". Is this legal?   My wife works as a manager for a major retail chain.  She recently went on short term disability because we had our second child.  We were under the impression that her job would be protected under FMLA (unpaid leave) for 12 weeks and she would be able to pay into the group health insurance the same amount that used to come out of her paycheck, which we are doing for both her and the kids (I'm on my own very expensive policy through my work).  Now we've been told that due to job restructuring she has lost her position and will no longer be able to receive the 12 weeks of group health coverage.  What bugs me about this is the restructuring seems to be mainly a change in the name of the positions, with slight modification to what they are responsible for.  The employee who took over for my wife is automatically moving to the new position, doesn't have to reinterview or anything, but my wife is being offered crappy severance (4 weeks pay, when she's been with the company for 7 years), or the ability to enter a pool to get SOME unspecified position back, that's required when her short term disability is over next month.  She has no option to continue on her FMLA, which doesn't seem right to me.  I hope I explained this clearly - does anyone have any advice here?"

Report Inaccuracies Here | Author    Original Post:  Bilked by ""gentlemans' club""   So bear with me here and I'll get the compensatory ill-advised choices admissions out of the way.  I went to a strip club with a group of friends in town for a reunion.  In my infinite wisdom I opened a credit card tab at the bar.  I had ONE beer and a couple lap dances that I paid for in cash.  I was then propositioned by a dancer who invited me to a more private area.  I told her that I'd like to have a private area with a few dancers and my buddies so we'd be out of the main clusterfuck of the club.  I agreed to $1000 and paid.  I walked over to this area where she sat down next to me, another dancer walked up immediately after, and was told that the agreed upon amount was not enough.  I told her that I couldn't justify paying more than this and she went into a long story about ""the club takes a big cut, blah blah""  and essentially said it wasn't going to happen for a grand.  Fair enough.  We parted ways and I naively thought that was the end of it.  Fast-forward to three days later where I discover a charge on my CC for $1758 including a $500 tip!  Needless to say I'm fucking livid and feel one part dumbshit and one part victim.  I got myself into quite the pickle here and this is money that I don't have.  (mind you, the $1000 was meant to be split among 8 fellas but since it didn't pan out I obviously wasn't hitting anyone up for cash.)  My question is:  what are my options here?  No doubt I paid for services that didn't materialize but how the hell do I prove it?  I have no qualms with pursuing a lawsuit if disputing the charges with my CC company doesn't work but wondering if any of the legal professionals out there have some thoughts.    And before any flaming ensues:  yes, i blew it by bringing a CC into a questionable establishment so reminding me of my stupidity won't help my situation.  just really looking for advice on how to dig my dumb ass out of a hole.    thanks in advance.

Between you and your supervisor, you've probably spent at least half a man-hour trying to solve this problem. Depending on your billing rates, that could translate to several hundreds of dollars in billable time. Compare that to the 0.1 hour billable time it would take to call the client and ask her to pull a fresh credit report (for about $10 out of pocket at most), and you'll realize that she might launch a missile when she gets the next bill - unless the billing attorney writes off the time or it's a contingency case. Most clients would rather be inconvenienced than billed for something they could have done for themselves (or for you).  BTW, it's also good to involve the client in the process because they generally like being part of the team, and involvement makes them less likely to complain about the bill or file a grievance."

legaladvice,3e2wvr,damageddude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"Really, it depends on a lot of factors. Maybe it is fraud, but it may also be estate planning (transferring all assets to children long before it is nursing home time). You should consult an estate attorney. Why didn't your mother simply refuse the inheritance? It would have passed to you (and maybe some siblings/cousins) anyway.  Non legal advice/personal experience: The last few years my mother was living independently in assisted living, my brother, sister and I took over all of her financial affairs. It was just easier. Ultimately my brother got POA and we concentrated everything with him. Her condo had been sold and would have been within the look back period when she needed a nursing home, but that money was gone by then, with her expenses supplemented with money from my siblings and myself (fortunately she had hers and our father's pensions and social security). In theory, if she hadn't been such a fracking pain in the tuckus when her health started failing stubborn, we would have had all her assets in our names by the time it mattered, but it became a moot point.   EDIT: what I am saying is that it is not unusual for a child to take over finances for an elderly parent, including putting assets in the child's name."

What is the status of that charge?  Did you plead guilty, or were you found guilty at trial?  What's the status of your child's custody?  Has it been temporarily removed?  Permanently removed?

I think right now the Veterans Affair is the only people who have seen what actually is happening and going on with this court.  They gave me great advise on how to prove my medical condition to a fault.    So, to your questions, I was never charged with a crime.  I was not taken to jail or gone before a judge for these charges. (This is what I told them in the civil complain that I just recently filed). It is not on my police record.  I did not plead guilty to any crimes.  I do not know how many times I have told the lawyers this.   The status of the third attempt at getting my child is that Judge threw out my claims of false allegations, fraudulent documents and address - essentially everything but the child custody modification.  She told me that I would have to go back to the other county to file that complaint.  In the last court meeting, she appointed a GAL.  In the case, she demanded in writing my medical records, lease, and proof of job. I provided her everything.  Then, she appointed a GAL stating that she is going with what the GAL recommends.  The Juvenile Court Judge gave my child to my mother guardianship until my child turns 18.  My mother tells me that she is supportive that I get my child back.  But, I am in a contested child custody case. (that is another story)."

A guardian ad litem represents your child's interests, not yours.   If you are still being denied access to your child after 7 or 8 years I have to wonder what you are not telling us?

legaladvice,3e2vz1,damageddude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"I just told you what happened.  I said, I did not place my child in the trash to go beg for money.  I do not mean to be rude but, I get this same thing from the lawyers.  I was there.  They took my child from my arms. She was not in a trash can.  I did not live in that county where they took my child.  I did not threaten my child or myself.  Since, I cannot get a lawyer to believe me I have to work on this myself.  The judges are not listening to me.  You are not listening.  I went back to court in 2007 as directed by the public defender.  Mind you, the very same public defender that I had in the beginning (I made a very bad mistake after talking with her about the case before filing child custody modification).  Now, I went back the started complaining about my mental condition.  I told that I have seen a psychiatrist as directed.  I was with the Veterans Affair.  They said, I had PTSD/MST.  But, they wanted my medical records from another clinic that was closed.  They said, ""I had schizophrenia.""  I told them that I was not a schizophrenic and the VA told them the same.  The other clinic closed the case after I challenged them and I told them that I was going to the VA because I was a veteran.  I have other evaluations and have not come up with that diagnosis again.  I have been very upfront with them.  I was upfront with the public defender who went to the Veterans Affair to verify what my diagnosis was. The DFACS gave the police officer the order to take my child with out a summons.  They later went to court and claimed an emergency in the other county.  I have not had any problems with the police since then.  BOLO is Be on the look out. and Judicial Qualification.  I know that GAL represents the child's best interest.  The GAL and prosecutor stated to the Judge that I place the child in the trash during both court case.  I have never seen any document showing or proving that I committed these crime.  I was never arrested but, they insist on accusing me.  Please excuse me for pleading but, this is getting out of hand.  Now, I am in my third case and the court where I live that I did not live in the other county so, they agreed but they do not agree with me that I did not place my child in the trash.  I just want them to get the evidence and make the person who made these allegations testify to this crime.  I was not arrest. I want them to do a proper investigation, produce evidence, and charge me instead of making me out to be something that I am not.    I was homeless in my county.  I was not homeless in the other county.  They were well aware of this issue.  I was homeless from 2005 to 2008 in Atlanta, GA.    If they did harm my child then they need to prove it.  This is what I want.  I can prove that I did not do it.  I will tell you that I told the VA about it before I went to court.  They were well aware that they were going to do the things that they did.      I must make you aware again that the medical case was closed with a medical diagnosis of schizophrenia.  They knew it.  They told me to go back to that clinic."

He claims to have followed up with the owner twice about the information, but the owner hasn't responded.  The owner only responded to his initial inquiries admitting liability and stating that he would only pay if we go to his friend's auto shop.  When I asked my adjuster whether they will be escalating the claim (i.e., sue the dude?) he gave me some vague answer about there being a process and how he may have to send this to collections but he doesn't want to ruin the guy's credit if he's just busy...

legaladvice,3dz9s0,Bob_Sconce,10,Mon Jul 20 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"IANAL  Obviously not too nice if they are allowing the valet company to represent them this way. While the company may be a separate entity from their own, they are the first and last people the customer interacts with. The owners should be taking this a lot more seriously than they are.   Go back and explain it this way.  Make sure they understand that this valet company is misrepresenting them and that you don't see the difference between the company and them.  Also point out that you might need to warn your friends on social media about the valet service and unfortunately that means posting about their restaurant so your friends understand where this company is working."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,ultralame,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:12 2015 UTC,"Worst case scenario, you make a claim and they tell you there is nothing they can do, its under deductible, and they immediately withdraw it for you.  Best case scenario, they do the research for you and report it to the other insurance company for you.  I'll bet reddit gold they'll do the latter."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,mail323,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:16 2015 UTC,"Do I hear reddit gold? ching ching ching just kidding  I've already made a claim with my insurance company and they are basically just playing a waiting game with this guy.  Its been about two months now and my insurance company most definitely has NOT done any research for me to find out who the valet company's insurance is.  I've followed up with my claims adjuster almost every week (pretty sure he's getting annoyed of me haha) and every time his response is that they are still waiting on the owner to get back to them with the insurance information.  They claim to have followed up twice, but haven't received a response yet as to the insurance.  They claim that other than a couple of initial emails back in May where the owner admitted liability but states we have to go to his friends shop to fix the car, he has not provided them with any of his business insurance information."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,Lambchops_Legion,17,Tue Jul 21 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"If the business that the valet was parking for has any risk management at all, they have the valet's insurance information.  That said, don't be surprised if he doesn't have any.   You can tell the owner that you have a right to take the car to any shop you choose, but the insurance company/financially responsible party does not have to guarantee the work outside of the network. That said, most good body shops will guarantee their work anyway.  Your path of least resistance is to let your insurance company handle this.  Alternatively, you can have the damage repaired and then sue the valet service in small claims court."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,mail323,9,Mon Jul 20 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice.  I called the business (a family-run restaurant) and they said they don't have the valet company's insurance information on hand because they're an independent company.  They just gave me the valet company owner's business card to contact him (which I already have).   As I mentioned in another comment, my insurance deductible is $500 (repair costs will be around $600-700).  The insurance agent told me that they will only reimburse me for the deductible if the other party admits liability and they are able to recover from the other party (which doesn't seem like will be anytime soon).  I'm also concerned that the insurance company doesn't really have any incentive to pursue legal action against the valet company since the amount is small.    I may just go the route you suggested - get the damage repaired, then sue in small claims court.   It's been over 2 months now since the accident occurred."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,Lambchops_Legion,9,Mon Jul 20 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Call your insurance company, explain to them that the other driver is at fault, and that if he will not turn over his insurance info, you expect your company to do their job and sue him on your behalf.  Ask why this is not happening.  If they refuse to do so, please post the name of the insurance company so I can cross them off my list."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,key2616,6,Mon Jul 20 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Haha okay.  I will do that and get back to you.  I guess I'm not really the demanding/ assertive type and generally just nod my okay to whatever the insurance company tells me.  I figured they handle this everyday and would do whatever needs to be done automatically - like maybe they are just following whatever process it is that they have to deal with these kinds of situations?  But since its been over two months, I should probably start questioning their effort in this a lot more"
legaladvice,3dz9s0,Lambchops_Legion,8,Mon Jul 20 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"5 years ago my wife was in an accident.  details aside, it was clearly not her fault.  However, she made the mistake of saying ""I didn't see the other driver until she hit me"" (because the other driver blew a stop sign).  So our company settled it 50/50, after zero communication for 3 months.  Had we been privy to their thinking, we would have corrected them.  But it made sense for them, financially, not to fight the other company.  I appealed (according to their rules), had to pay $125 for an internal lawyer, and had it reviewed with new evidence about the intersection (that they should have asked for) and emphasis on what we thought really happened.  The changed it to 60/40 their fault, and we didn't see a rise in premium.  But it was still BS.  The point is, that the insurance company is not working for you, but for themselves.  Hold them to the fire, don't let it languish, get them to do something.  You pay for it!  good luck!"

A) he's not at fault, B) its most likely under the surcharge threshold. Auto pricing doesn't work like that.  It might change because of a change in reserves, profitibility, or high level strategy in that state, but it won't be for this accident."
legaladvice,3dz9s0,CujoCrunch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:15 2015 UTC,What's the typical surcharge threshold for at-fault claims?
legaladvice,3dz9s0,CujoCrunch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's a broad question because not only does it depend on company, it depends on the state, and the actuary whose coming up with the rating models for that particular product.  $1000-$1500 is the general rule of thumb. Basically if it's less than or barely over your 6mo premium that for that vehicle, you aren't going to get surcharged."
