ZenHabits,3e1dpi,sa-steve-va,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"I'll have a look, although I confess I'm a little nervous of the idea of guided meditation.  For me, meditation is about trying to clear my mind and notice for myself what thoughts pop up, so that I can gently push them to one side and come back to them later if needed.  The idea of giving someone else free rein to introduce  their choice of thoughts or ideas into my mind while I'm in that state doesn't appeal to me - probably because I'm a bit of a control freak!  But I'm sure it works well for some people, thanks for the link."

The idea is that your brain responds more actively to questions rather than statements. So repeating the affirmation ""I wake up quickly and easily each day"" may help you stop being sluggish in the morning, but using the AffOrmation ""Why do I wake up quickly and easily each day?"" makes your brain try to come up with answers and solutions to your sluggishness ""problem"".  Hope this helps.  They seem to work for me!"

Looking back at what happened, these events would have been better framed as an exercise in patience and problem solving. But I grew a little bit, I now know a little more of how to deal with these issues. The path in front of me is bumpy, but it will be okay.  Sure, I don't have all that high-end equipment all the other videographers and filmmakers have, but what I have works for me. I can still shoot and make something people will like.

However, I'd like to point out that yours seems very much like an atheist perspective.  However, there are lots of people who are not atheists.  Re-read our previous exchange with this fact in mind:  One of the world's largest (i.e. ""most widespread"") religions teaches that after death you will either go to a place of pure bliss, OR you will go to a place of eternal damnation. Eternal suffering. Eternal torment.  Then there are people like me. People who think that maybe there is something after this... but I'll be damned if I have any idea what that might even look like.   Maybe it's nothingness.  Maybe it's something much better than this.  ...or maybe it isn't....  My entire point was that none of us knows for certain. We have lots of beliefs, or hopes. But none of us knows.

ZenHabits,3dbkh8,Lightfiend,8,Wed Jul 15 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"For those who want to test this, I'd strongly encourage you to go take a few rounds on the various TV shows and other media that are popular amongst children.  As a young father, I have to admit it's been more than a little disappointing, even frustrating at times, how kids' shows go out of their way to ridicule almost any level of intelligence, interest in education or self-improvement, or even thinking about things too hard.  Instead, they encourage and make light of characters making ridiculous decisions with little consequences. I understand that it's not necessarily fair to expect the majority of kids' media to be self aware or encourage depth, but at the same time these messages are overwhelming in how persistent they are across the board. It makes me reflect on the kind of media I consumed as a kid, the philosophies they imparted to me (whether I realized it or not at the time), etc. I can't help but wonder if being fed ideas like this in such a positive light from a young age effected our outlook or perception of life.  Ex: Look at how many TV shows encourage the idea of ""hating school"" because ""x topic sucks and isn't useful at all"". This kind of ignorance is actively encouraged, even if it is only intended for yucks."
ZenHabits,3dbkh8,Piph,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"Devil's Advocate, here. That's certainly encouraging a mindset, but is it really stigmatizing the opposite? If I were to openly consider going back to college, I can't imagine any of my family, friends, or coworkers being anything but encouraging about it."
ZenHabits,3dbkh8,RainTea,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"Greetings, Devil! College is an interesting example to talk about.  First, I have no doubt those around you would be encouraging but, unfortunately, this doesn't resolve the issue. In cases like this, I think actions speak louder than words.  If you ask folks if you should go to college and learn, almost everyone will be supportive. Then again, there may also be those who try to warn you from the sizable student debts, but we'll leave that out of this.  When we hear ""college"" in media and conversations, what sort of imagery pops into our heads? If we compare the number of intellectually-inspiring stories that are presented about college to the number of stories about college being a place for wild parties and poor decisions, which do you think we have more of?  How many folks do you think go to college and are legitimately excited for their futures, in comparison to the number that go because they don't know what else to do and maybe they can make some friends?  These answers aren't set in stone and vary depending on where you're from, but I definitely think these questions and their answers are worth considering. I'm not condemning society, just pointing out some things about us that we may prefer to ignore.  P.S. Also think about people's reactions to various degree choices. Do you notice a trend of positivity for those majors which are focused on production of services/products or that pay well enough to allow the individual to become a larger consumer."

ZenHabits,3dbkh8,FruityBoxer,7,Wed Jul 15 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the book. Also, did you get it in the Library or did you buy it?. Did you search it, does it belong to the sort of things you are interested in, or did you read it because the cover looked good, you wanted to show off, or someone else told you to?  Learning something you enjoy is not necessarily consuming goods. The reason why at the end you enjoy that or what you want to become once learned, can be consuming goods, or more likely, consuming propaganda.  Just saying."

ZenHabits,3dbkh8,Dan-Man,8,Wed Jul 15 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"I think they are ""stigmatized"" in the sense that they aren't considered ""productive.""   It can be surprisingly hard for people to take time for themselves, even to enjoy the simple things without the thought of, ""Hm, I could be getting work done right now"" or ""I could be doing something more productive."" When's the last time you honestly did spend 15-20 minutes watching a sunset?  ""Stigmatize"" may be a strong word, but I do think the message rings true in some cultures that if we aren't doing something that involves gaining material wealth, then it's ultimately a waste of time."
ZenHabits,3dbkh8,cosmicartery,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"As is the case with many quotes/writers etc, the word stigmatized is a little strong, used in order to gain attention.  Your explanation makes more sense.  His point is that any conciousness not solely focused on material goods, is considered a waste of time and productivity in our society. Because money."
ZenHabits,3dbkh8,Definitelynotatwork9,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"Money is the only thing that you need more and more of, seemingly without end. Because that's its purpose: to be spent. But it very easily acquires the role of something that you can never have enough of. And people start trying to obtain more money just because it's what you do. You don't need more friends all the time, you don't need more sex partners all the time, you don't need more things all the time. It's hard to break this mentality when it's become so ubiquitous in western culture"

ZenHabits,3d4fs3,Lightfiend,6,Mon Jul 13 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you know I actually strongly disagree with this. To say that there is a sensation of fancy, of reverie, of epiphany, that some people have and that it is coupled with a power to act upon whereas others don't, is a dangerous notion, because it separates us from eachother. I beleive that every person is born with a concousness that doesn't want for magic and miracles and poetry but to have the education, the freedoms and opportunities to channel them into acheivementd is a very different thing. People who work in sectors that are not artistic do still appreciate beauty, people who don't make journeys outside of their small world's have many reasons that they may do so.... I know I'm not articulating myself that we'll but I sometimes see a 'genius' worship in the world for successful artists and entrepreneurs that borders on elevating these folks above other 'mere mortals' and that has so much danger.  Now of course this quote seems to be also railing against closed mindedness... which of course is also truly dangerous but I just felt the need to point out that this notion is actually kind of screwed up: it suggests that there are only a few people who really live life 'right' and everyone else doesn't inherently have the ability to do so because there is something different/stunted about their minds...its one thing to say that someone is talented or insightful, another to say there is a whole class of people who 'don't dream' (in the figurative) or if they do it is vanity.... just my two cents, I know there are many different interpretations and this could be way off..."

One just acts upon their passion and the other does not. I don't think he meant a strict day and night dreamers. They both are capable and not exclusive.   It's just that the ones who dream by day are seen to take action. While the night dreamers are seen as dormant.   Also I don't think he's just talking about the creative or artist. But all walks of life. Whether that is the engineer at a power plant, a construction worker, or a ballet dancer, they all have their version of the dream and how they pursue it."

I guess if I have a bias its that I have thought about this notion alot before and just felt the need to make my point known in response to this statement.... I am peeved when people think they are superior to other ""sheeple"" just as I am dissapointed when many people think that modern art and Lit are too pretensious.

They aren't going to change over night anyway, and it's possible that if you are too aggressive or too forward, they will go further into that undesirable quality. So yeah, I don't know, is my answer to your question."
ZenHabits,3cltsg,Bebopopotamus,7,Thu Jul 9 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"The art of criticizing somebody is by telling them how they make you feel rather than calling their flaw a fact. ""You are ungrateful."" is your opinion, not all people might feel the way about this person, so state it as an opinion and not as a fact: ""I don't feel appreciated enough by you."" or something along these lines.  You won't be able to change them, but if you tell them how they make other people feel around themselves they might want to reconsider their behavior. Insulting them will never work, that's correct."

ZenHabits,3cltsg,P1r4nha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"While I generally agree, I don't think this applies as well to adults past past their 20s unfortunately. Hard to teach old dogs new tricks.... unless they're willing to learn. I suppose there are people who are always open and receptive of criticism, and those are people who would be able to change bad habits even at age 50 if shown a better way, while some people are naturally more defensive and not open to criticism and they can't be given advice on their behaviours, ever. Not sure if you think this view is correct :)"

ZenHabits,3cltsg,BetaZetaSig,2,Thu Jul 9 02:36:00 2015 UTC,State it as an opinion and not as a fact. Don't call them ungrateful. Tell them how you feel. Then it's their decision to care and change or not care about you.
ZenHabits,3cltsg,P1r4nha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:02:06 2015 UTC,Are you kidding? Matter of opinion makes any remarks feel so much more personal and likely for some sort of behavioral backfire.
ZenHabits,3cltsg,BetaZetaSig,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not kidding. It makes your statement less confrontational and makes you more vulnerable. It's easy to judge people, it's harder to admit what their behavior is doing to you.  It's long been established in psychology that arguments will not be solved when people accuse each other of things. ""You are ungrateful."" is an accusation. If you make the 'you' sentence an 'I' sentence ""I don't feel appreciated."" you're pointing to a problem that you have instead of them as the source of the problem.  It's the same thing, but with a bit of rhetoric you can easily keep an argument calm and short."
ZenHabits,3cltsg,P1r4nha,3,Thu Jul 9 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"People don't generally work that way, I'm afraid. Telling someone why they suck leads straight into defensive behavior, certainly nothing productive."

ZenHabits,3cltsg,SoundSalad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"Depends if the other person is willing to listen and change and you present him/her with a CONSTRUCTIVE criticism at the right given time and at the right place, sure. Even then, there are various other factors involved at play here that could predict if your action would be a catalyst for a change for the other person or not.   Or maybe this may be embedded within their mind as a seed, which its growth can be triggered by some other events they experience later on."
ZenHabits,3cltsg,solid07,9,Thu Jul 9 14:39:02 2015 UTC,So what should we do instead?

ZenHabits,3cltsg,ozarkia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:09:46 2015 UTC,That's the right answer right here. The difference between calling them a name and constructive criticism.
ZenHabits,3cltsg,P1r4nha,2,Thu Jul 9 08:01:12 2015 UTC,I think what is meant is that an explanation needs to follow any blaming which would explain why exactly you think this way. The explanation should be logical and consistent with empirical observations and thus would be valid and not taken as an accusation by the other person.
ZenHabits,3cltsg,entropychange,3,Thu Jul 9 00:53:13 2015 UTC,Wow what a genius piece of advice. I told my friend he was an ungrateful piece of shit not because I want to solve anything. I just want him to know and not call me again.

I wasn't referring to a simple and quick ""fix"" (like do it and done), but rather we are integrating simple and quick ""steps"" (each of which moves you incrementally toward a better life--and world).  Example: Start each meal with 30 seconds in mindful appreciation. Express your gratitude for a friend with a hand-written card. Allow a stranger in line in front of you at the market.  So it's small little habits and activities that build a more conscious and compassionate life we're seeking.  Hope this clarifies. Thanks again for catching my flub!"

Every book I've read on spirituality claims the opposite: that we are not our emotions.  When we identify with them, we actually lose who we are.  We are not ""angry"", ""sad"", or ""happy"".  We feel ""angry"", ""sad"", or ""happy"".  Just a thought! :) But otherwise, a great read!"
ZenHabits,3blyzg,TheNerdistRedditor,2,Tue Jun 30 08:12:27 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree. For example Roald Dahl suggested that a good idea for a writer was to finish writing for the day with a good idea for the next day so that it was easy to start.  I have adopted a zillion little tricks like this that have made me more productive.  So while there are probably no tricks that will turn someone from a scatterbrained flake into a laser focused obsessive there are certainly enough good ones to make life better.

But seriously, I don't think there's inherently anything wrong in getting attached to our journeys or following the ""flashes of lights"", as you put it. As long as you can cultivate a headspace that allows a detachment of your essential happiness from the results of your earthly bindings, why not just experience the hell out of life however you want to? Some people want to know what it feels like to start a company, have a six pack, get rich and buy a boat. Why not just go for it and see what that's like? If you don't care about that and are more interested in something else, cool! You can do that instead. Maybe you want to see what it feels like to be well educated, healthy, you know, in as peak form as you could possibly be. Some people are curious about what that experience is like. Why not go for it, just to see?   Here's Bill Hicks at his best, speaking about just the thing that you seem to be getting at (seriously, if you haven't heard this before, it's a classic):  http://youtube.com/watch?v=ER6uv2xtuCg  But notice that he compares life to an amusement ride.

ZenHabits,3be237,SBuck33,5,Mon Jun 29 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions â Dan Ariely  The book has many strengths, the main one being that it convincingly presents many ways people are wired and/or conditioned to be irrational, usually without even being aware of it. This eye-opening revelation can be a bit disheartening, but the good news is that we can fix at least some of this irrationality by being aware of how it can arise and then making a steady effort to override it or compensate for it. Descartesâ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain â Anthony Damasio  Damasioâs main contention is that logic and reason are impossible without emotion. That is why intuitions are called gut feelings. He goes over many case studies, experiments, and introspection, to drive this point home. Thinking, Fast and Slow â Daniel Kahneman  Daniel Kahneman presents the brain as we have never seen it. The basis of the book is simple. In judging the world around us, we use two mental systems: Fast and Slow. The Fast system (System 1) is mostly unconscious and makes snap judgments based on our past experiences and emotions. When we use this system we are as likely to be wrong as right. The Slow system (System 2) is rational, conscious and slow. They work together to give us a view of the world around us. The Political Mind: A Cognitive Scientistâs Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics â George Lakoff  Drawing on the latest brain science and a very nice range of examples to support his case, Lakoff develops logically persuasive and easily understood models for the cognitive cause-and-effect relationships that emerge as political differences. How the Mind Works â Steven Pinker  This book is about more than just the mind: it is about the entire human being, with special focus on the motivational complexes stemming, in part at least, from innate, genetic factors within the human organism. Pinker discusses human nature from the viewpoint of evolutionary psychology. The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales â Oliver Sacks  The man who mistook his wife for a hat is probably the most interesting clinical psychology books ever written. It is utterly fascinating to know that, as a result of a neurological condition, a man can actually mistake his wife for a hat and not realize it. In reading this book, you come to respect and appreciate the human brain as well as those who are struggling to deal with one of the conditions which Sacks explores. The Computer and the Mind: An introduction to Cognitive Science â Philip Johnson-Laird  A great introduction into the field of cognitive science, fit for a layman with little or zero scientific knowledge. Why Donât Students Like School: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom â Daniel T. Willingham  Imagine you could sit down with a cognitive scientist and ask him to explain how studentsâ brains learn, so that you could better teach them. Dan Willingham has written a book which achieves that very effect."

ZenHabits,3bbqnw,anotheravailabl,2,Sat Jun 27 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Are your bad feelings rooted in jealousy? To me it seems your partner has done what she can to express that she loves you and values your relationship over this hobby which is also important and valuable to her. Since flat-out asking her to stop is clearly a poor choice (and will probably lead to more relationship problems and resentment down the road) I think it might be a good idea to work on your own resentments, anger, and jealousy, and to turn those feelings into acceptance and joy.   My first thought was to try and do some specialized lovingkindness meditations. Start with yourself, then your girlfriend, then her friends who support her burlesque, then the fellow burlesque performers, then the audience, then possibly even the creepy camera guy. If at any point you feel overwhelmed with anger, go back to the beginning and start again. You can find a ""template"" for lovingkindness meditations online with a quick google search and tailor it to your own needs.   Another thing I would suggest is being open with your partner about your strong need for trust. Let her know, in a gentle way, that it makes you feel worried and concerned when she doesn't feel comfortable confiding in you (like with the camera incident). Then try asking what you can do differently to make her more comfortable in the future. Remember that reacting with anger leaves everyone hurt. If you feel angry at any point, excuse yourself if possible and take a calming meditative walk.   I hope this helps!"
ZenHabits,3bbqnw,goodnightbird,3,Sat Jun 27 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"I also wonder how OPs sex life is. With her empowering her body like that, and also having such a strong relationship with OP (you guys sound very communicative), I would think it'd be better than ever. Except it sounds like there's some misplaced feelings lingering here. She really just needs to know how you feel, not because she needs to change or stop, nor because you need to change or stop,  but because being vulnerable is part of being human! I am a guy,  and know how gut wrenching it can feel to be vulnerable, but expressing yourself is one of the only times you can really let off some steam for no other reason than because you have to to yourself and your partner. And aside from that it feels very nice and can shed light onto some of the questions you're having trouble answering, such as this kink you see in your relationship, but mainly this kink you see in yourself."
ZenHabits,3bbqnw,Wash_Your_Winkie,2,Sat Jun 27 19:24:46 2015 UTC,"Well how would you like to approach it? If you in principle want her to be able to keep doing it, then I guess the best solution would be for you to figure out how you can cope with that. Why does it bug you? Does it feel unfair? Is it an insecurity that you want to work on? The key is to figure out how you can be ok with her doing it.   If you don't want her to keep doing it, that's perfectly acceptable too. If she genuinely would prefer giving it up to causing a schism in the relationship, then that's a reasonable option. A lot of people will tell you (and you seem to think this way already) that you are trying to 'control' her, but that's not really the story you're describing. If you are of the mindset that in a relationship your bodies are only for each other, then that's your belief. In asking her to not do this dancing you aren't controlling her, you are saying ""this isn't what I want in a relationship."" It's then her choice to listen and react accordingly, or to disregard. It's them your choice to decide what to do after.   I've personally been in both positions with varying outcomes. I've been jealous for no reason in good relationships and I've been jealous for good reason in abusive relationships. I've also ended relationships because my partner wouldn't adhere to my wishes, had relationships ended because I didn't adhere to my partners wishes, and I've had relationships where I/my partner articulated a concern, the behavior was changed, and things worked great.   There's no right or wrong. It's all based on how the two of you feel. Anyone who tries to hard line you one way or the other on this is just trying to push their own beliefs into you. So you just have to sit and ask yourself what you (both) will be most happy with, and pursue that."

I know you have NO interest in moving towards polyamory, but the point is, there are people who feel jealous about things they REALLY WANT to be okay with, and that IS the position you're in.   So I think their resources might be really useful to you, if you just apply it to your own situation   http://www.morethantwo.com/becomingsecure.html  PS it's actually just modified cognitive behavoiour therapy (CBT) techniques, but specifically applied to jealousy, so that might be another place to look"

In other words, you could theoretically say exactly what is necessary, no more and no less, but chances are you will be slightly off-mark, and it's better to say slightly too little than slightly too much. If you say too little, the other person can always ask for the additional information which they seek, or you can add it on later when you realise. Knowledge is power, better to keep it for yourself if you're not sure that sharing it will benefit you on net balance.

I've found myself talking to my wife before about a new insight or the work I'm doing and realize it's really just me being so excited that I wanted to talk about it, as opposed to contributing something of value or there being any need for me to say what I did.  A lot of us think our words have more value than they actually do, when a lot of times just staying quiet would have been about the same.  When we argue, it's not about talking the other person out of it so much as it is letting the other person calm down and cool off...  When we're excited it's not that what we're saying is important, it's just that we really feel like talking...  And also, our words aren't the actual thing being described in almost all cases.   We talk thinking what we're saying is the thing, ""You should have seen it! It did this! And looked like this! This works this way!"" When really if you were to just show it to them in some way that allowed them to experience it for themselves (if possible) you'd be far more effective in communicating.  Ultimately though, the conversation about what one needs to do to actually realize this and live it (or become it) is different from (and far more important than) talking about whether it's a good thing to talk or not in different situations. So I'll place my focus on simply communicating when I have value to add to another person (or out of necessity).  I appreciate the read, thank you for posting!"

First of all you need to take action. Then you need to make yourself promises and verbalized those promises to others to hold you accountable.

I like to think of ""proper"" meditation like sitting meditation as a form of training/learning, and being mindful in activities as ""applying"" that learning. So actually being meditative while doing your tasks is perfectly fine.  As for sitting in meditation, the fact that you struggle with it is great reason to explore a bit more. When facing any unpleasant thoughts or feelings it's quite natural to want to push them away. But it's great you're aware of it, that's the first step!  But instead of feeling that urge to react to them, can you stay with them for a while and observe how it feels it your mind and body? See if you can observe and accept that they are there without your usual reaction. What happens then?  Depending on what meditation you do, you can simply go back to the instructions for your particular practice â some people focus on the breath, some on a mantra, some on particular visualisations â stick with those basic instructions, and work with it over time and see what you learn!"

ZenHabits,3af186,The_Dead_See,20,Fri Jun 19 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"The article reads to me as though the person involved was a) coming under a biological depression and/or psychosis that may not have had anything to do with the meditation itself and b) was not under the tutelage of a more experienced teacher. Vipassana meditation can certainly shake you up, bringing to light thought patterns that went unnoticed by you before. And the experience of not being able to locate an immutable core or self can be disorienting and terrifying. But a good teacher would help you to observe these emotions and thoughts simply, as they are, without judgement. That's the whole point (of Vipassana at least) - to enter a place of equanimous, present moment observation of your mind, body and surroundings. The individual in the article freely admits he ceased observing and instead caught onto the thoughts he was having and went along for the ride - pretty much the antithesis of correct meditation technique.   So should some individuals avoid meditation? I don't think so. It's scientifically studied benefits far outweigh any negatives discovered. But perhaps some people with particularly reactive and fearful personalities should consider doing it only under the supervision of an experienced teacher."
ZenHabits,3af186,thepeskyibex,5,Fri Jun 19 17:01:43 2015 UTC,"Well said. The only statement I'm inclined to see differently is ""the antithesis of [...] meditation."" I think exploring thoughts and where they go is a perfectly acceptable form of meditation as long as that is the intent. With said intent in mind, exploring and feeling out thoughts is possible without being attached to the results. Without that intent, attachment is much more likely to occur and begin to reverberate and take over the session. Without something to keep one on track, the hole delved into can be a tough one to climb out."

ZenHabits,3af186,metafish,4,Sat Jun 20 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"Can you overdo meditation?  Meditation is a single word, like ""exercise"".  Can you overdo exercise?  Can exercise be harmful?  Think of meditation like any other activity.    Aerobics is generally considered good.  But certainly some people practice it wrong/too much and that causes problems.  Some people have a medical issue and might die from it.  Some people practice it right but it makes them feel worse because of immune system reactions.  And even healthy people can get caught up in doing aerobics too much.  For most people, aerobics is a Pretty Good Idea.  (Also consider resistance training.  I'm only making a point, not trying to start  a separate debate. :)  I also have a bit of a problem with the attitude that ""some people who are mentally unstable shouldn't meditate"".  That really puts the blame on the person rather than the meditation itself.  Based on what evidence?  And which kind of meditation is bad for which kind of ""mental instability""?  The problem is that some people are going to have problems with meditation and it's just too easy to blame the person as  being ""mentally unstable"" or ""negative attitude"".  If meditation is only good for people who are mentally stable with positive attitudes, then that excludes all whole lot of people.  Then if someone does have a problem with it, it can be discounted as ""they weren't mentally stable"" or ""they didn't have a teacher"".    And  then there's the teacher thing.  What if they had a teacher and had problems with it?  ""The didn't have the right teacher.""  How do you insure you have ""the right teacher""?  Yada yada yada...  Meditation is not safe for everyone, which is to say that statistically, a certain number of people who practice it will have detrimental effects for some reason.  But then one also has to ask, ""what type of meditation""?  There's lots of different kinds.  Which one, if any, is right for you?  Which is wrong?  There's currently no objective answer to this.  Another problem with this article is that of all people who meditate, some are going to have various mental issues like  depression, etc.  Who's to say that the meditation was the cause?  People often make the mistake that correlation equals causation.  It's easy to see someone have some depression in their life and blame it on meditation, but that's not proof of anything.    A lot of information about meditation is anecdotal, and we know that entire invalid systems of belief can be built up on the grounds of anecdotal systems.  There's  a lot of ""woo"" beliefs about meditation.  tldr; Meditation is only a single word that describes a vast range of practices.  You don't have to believe that ""meditation"" (whatever that means) is the only path to be spiritual, have a good life, be wise, or be enlightened.  Yes, you can overdo it.  You probably won't. It might help you in some way, but only you can determine that.  Even walking outside your house has risks."
ZenHabits,3af186,koalaphysics,3,Sat Jun 20 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"This is why having a good teacher and/or support network is important. A lot of people in the articles about falling into the pit of the void often seem to be suffering from an actual mental illness that was either buried well or nascent before when they began and ended up developing/emerging when they hit the edge of their ego. Depression seems to be a big one, which would make sense for people who aren't well equipped to deal with death and some of the other deeper concepts that people run into when meditating.  It's important for people to acknowledge that there is a potential for bad outcomes in contemplative practices, but they should also remember that any derangement, extreme perversions, and depressive symptoms should be discussed with a psychologist if they begin to actually impact their life. A lot of people seem to just hope that they can meditate more, and it will go away, but without guidance and support they'll only go deeper into the void.  TL;DR: There isn't a problem with too much meditation. The problem is people continuing with unskilled/unguided meditation compounded with personal mental factors without seeking help before they ruin themselves."
ZenHabits,3af186,athanathios,3,Fri Jun 19 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"There are people who may have psychological problems that left untreated may have issues if that's not addressed apart from meditation.   I have read the article some time ago. The dark night of the soul (see St. John of the Cross) is actually a very common stage of the insight process whereby one feels a by-product of the insights of meditation that may be barely if at all noticable or could hang out for sometime. For me realization of some of the deeper truths of the Buddha through a deep meditative experience meant I was ungrounded and lacked a reference ponit, this is the best way to describe it. But at the end I emerged in a very powerful state of equanimity and went on from there to get happiness like I never knew existed before. I didn't have a teacher, but the issue is (A) people not going to teachers or when they need them (I was lucky to emerge by myself), but often people need additional guidance. Additionally (B) people think meditation is a panacea for all the pains and this isnât the case."

Different for everyone of course, just a thought"
ZenHabits,3af186,lion_bait,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:41:38 2015 UTC,"The way I like to equate ""overmeditating"" is to a bad acid or mushroom trip. When you trip for the first time you often have a new mindset come upon you which is called ego death. This is where I believe the bad trips you always hear people fear mongering about come from. With ego death it becomes extremely hard to lie to yourself. To defend the action you took in certain situations. Having tripped multiple times, the bad trips come from people who are more or less, very unselfaware. Since the defense mechanisms don't come in to play while tripping, there's no voice saying ""hey remember that time you did said shitty thing? Well its justified cus excuses excuses excuses!"" You don't have that cheerleader of an ego keeping you from feeling bad about all the shit that was done. And realization of the lack of accountability, responsibility, self control, discipline and selflessness all come together to create a perfect shit storm of ""holy shit life isn't what I thought it was for x amount of years. I've been all wrong"" this is a good and bad thing depending where one goes from there. If the person ruminates, which comes from lack of disciplined mind (can be fixed), then they will most likely destroy their self worth by beating themselves up which is ultimately the only thing rumination does. But if one takes the thoughts and emotions experienced and uses them as tools to make themselves better then they are using the drugs therpuetically. This is where meditation ties in. Meditation leads people to new ideas and train of though. When this happens there is plenty of discord that occurs between the new ideas  (that are more than likely improvements on current ways of thinking) and old. This leads to bringing the walls of your current reality down. It makes people realize that instead of shaping your life people mostly are  shaped by life events. Reactionary vs proactive. Once this hits you realize you haven't been in control of yourself as much as you would like to think. All the pride dissappear because you didn't form it you were formed by it. The appearance of control you have of your life before meditating seems very imoressive. Until you realize that you've be disillusioned into believing you have had control. Most often, people are controlled by their base emotions and desires and that makes them who they are. It's like being a ball of clay that life throws rocks at. The clay becomes dented and shaped by the rocks. We're not so much like the door that bounces rocks right back off. We like to think we are but meditation proves other wise at first.   It's like why people lie. It's never easy being truthful because it can be hurtful and completely dissolve someone's perceptions of themselves and life. In those times there is inner turmoil to reconcile the past with the new train of thought. The difference of whether one will experience positive meditation or negative comes from  their mindset and the ability to accept the truth without rumination and self destruction. Prior life experience sets some people up for this better than others. Guidance from others can help. I'd say the author of that article had plenty of mental discord after having certain thoughts shoved right in his face. He couldn't deny it but he also couldn't figure out how to get over it and use it in a positive manner. But when there is a problem we tend to find a way to fix it and although the author seems turned off of meditation, it might be the one thing that brings him to peace one day. You can't have good without the bad. So if it ever is bad look for ways to make it better and it will eventually flow that way. It's how life seemingly flows.  I'm on mobile. Sorry for an errors."

It follows the rule of: Act like the person you want to be, and soon you'll be the person you act like.   It applies to situations like this. Automatism is our greatest gift as it is our greatest adversary. Our behavior is already predefined based on the way we acted in the past, based on what's familiar to us. Most of those familiar things, we didn't pick for ourselves, they just happened in time and they're shaping our behavior today (habits, default modes of thinking, beliefs, etc.)   Here I point to Rogers (a humanistic psychologist) and his idea of the ideal self, which we all strive for. The key to making all of this work is find out what our ideal self is, and changing our daily routine in such a way (like you described above) that would be in sync with the behavior of our ideal self. In time, the ideal self because the real self and we become happier and fulfilled. Hope I helped! :)"

I think it's more important that you only do this as a test to see how you're doing, and reflect honestly on if you need to work harder.   3 - basically ""money doesn't buy happiness"". Followed quickly by the article saying 'you only need 75,000 to max our your happy/rich ratio!' Yeah, many people don't make nearly that much. And even if you do, it's not an automatic ticked to leave the rat race. To quit your job and live in humble peace, you do need more like the 1-3 million mark. It's a fantasy to act like you get to quit. Maybe you don't need overtime every week, but I think this point was pretty poorly expressed."

ZenHabits,39qcmt,Gleb_Tsipursky,3,Sat Jun 13 18:53:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think meaning and purpose are important.  I first noticed this when I became an atheist as a young teen. Like many newborn atheists, I fell into a ""nihilistic trap."" If life is just nature, evolution, and random chaos, how can it have any intrinsic meaning? Surely, any meaning we do find in the madness is all ""make believe?""  Needless to say, this perspective made me very depressed. I felt like a meaningless cog in a wheel, without any real control over my life or what happens to me. Life is what it is and I'm just a passive observer.  My problem was I was looking for meaning ""out there."" I wanted an answer to life, the universe, to God - and all the big ideas that are seemingly ungraspable.    But what I should've been doing was looking for meaning ""in here."" What's meaningful to me? Meaning is an inherently subjective and contextual thing.   Now when I think about meaning, I always remind myself to ask, ""Meaningful to who?""   Meaning is a product of consciousness. That doesn't mean it isn't a ""real"" thing though. It took me awhile to make it over that hurtle in my thinking.  In general, I think a sense of meaning and purpose are a great buffer against daily stress, and this is why they are associated with both physical and mental benefits.   Having a sense of purpose reminds you that you're contributing to a ""bigger picture"" (your family, your relationships, your work, your community). It reminds you that you're not just a passive observer, but an active participant in this world - even if it's only within your small sphere of influence.  A friend of mine recently said, âNihilism is one infinitesimal grain away from being true, but that grain makes all the difference.â I believe that grain represents our own daily choices and actions, and the small influence they have on the world we live in."

In that subculture, handshakes are considered almost abhorrent. Instead, long, close hugs are commonplace even amongst strangers. Non-sexual body contact is the norm and ignores gender and sexuality roles.   I always inevitably come back from these things refreshed, smiling, with a bounce in my step, and a vibe of relaxed goodwill towards all that lingers for days or even weeks afterwards. At first I attributed it to the time off work, the exercise, the fresh air etc. but I could never figure out why other active outdoor vacations didn't leave me with that same incredible buzz.   Now I honestly think skin hunger may have something to do with it. I cuddle my wife of course. And I sort of 'A frame' hug close friends in greeting and farewell, but other than that there's no contact in my life as close and genuine as that I experience at flow festivals. Just a couple of days of real contact with others can produce a recharge lasting five times that long.   Makes me wonder what our society would be like if hugs, not handshakes, were the norm. Much less angry, much more relaxed and happy I suspect.   If anyone is reading this article and yearning for genuine body contact, definitely look into attending a flow festival regardless of whether you're interested in circus arts or not. Check out the benefits for yourself."

ZenHabits,39gpfs,renstaaa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:14:15 2015 UTC,"Oddly there aren't that many near Chi as far as I know. Probably the closest are Kinetic Fire in OH and Camp Fire in MN which have both already passed this year. Coming up are PlayThink festival in KY, june 10-14; and Flowcamp, also in KY sept 24-27. The biggest are Firedrums and Pacific Fire both on the west coast.   However Chi does have a huge flow arts scene despite its dearth of festivals. You could meet many of them at one of the monthly 'Full Moon Jams' at Garfield Park - [www.fullmoonjam.org](www.fullmoonjam.org). Or feel free to join the Milwaukee/Madison Community - 3rd Coast Hoopers and Spinners."
ZenHabits,39gpfs,The_Dead_See,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"That does trigger a thought. I've grown up with the idea of hugging is strange unless you're dating them or know them very well. But sometimes the human body need physical contact in a non sexual way. Which is why I find the idea of a masseuse to be helpful. The only part that sucks is that you have to pay for one. There used to be a meetup group that specifically had cuddle gatherings, but that somehow vanished overtime for some reason."

Life would have been a lot easier if you had just focused on attaining some medium level jobs, working on your goals on the side, and saving some money first before pursuing anything further. Then you could have bought or rented a home, afforded children, had a marriage without stress of expenses, and had one person work while the other pursued their goal and took care of the kid. Then vice versa 5 years down the line for the other person. Just saying, you put the weight in your own shoulders. 22, and you were already married and wanting a child, that's incredibly reckless"

The news works to sell you the most extreme things - they look for the people who will say crazy shit because it attracts viewers. And online communities can get hostile quickly, sometimes reaching out to real life. But most people saying this shit online don't have half the balls in real life. It's only through anonymity that they have the courage.   But to help with the anger, maybe look inside yourself and compare to others. Why do these people do these things? Is it possible that the anger you feel is the same thing that drives them to make death threats? Is it maybe that some people can't control their own rage and so they have to project it onto others to absolve themselves of it? And how does that work - being absolved? Do they feel better after saying hate, or do they only feel more hate?   I think it's clear - let go of the hate and it loses control over you."

ZenHabits,396p5u,monkeyinprocess,2,Tue Jun 9 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"You said that you tried mindfulness instruction. I'd encourage you to keep trying that. Are there MBSR classes, specifically, near you?   In the short run:  1.) Try not to worry about the worrying and stress. If you notice that you are doing this, take 4 deep breaths, breathing out longer than you breathe in. Focus on letting tension go while you exhale.  2.) Find a mantra that you can repeat in moments of stress. I used ""In this moment, I am ok."" for a long time.  3.) Take a mixed probiotic to help your gut (and potentially to help your stress response - recent research indicates ties between these). Something like this, for instance: http://www.vitacost.com/megafood-megaflora-plus-50-billion-cfu-30-capsules?csrc=GPF-PA-Vitamins%20%26%20Supplements-051494102176&ci_gpa=pla&ci_kw=&ci_src=17588969&ci_sku=051494102176&gclid=CjwKEAjwndqrBRC16IyeqPicp3ASJAB-vB-cda7lTtjeDSM6RloVRKCgfJzD7e3JN84YULRgEjpzkhoCIczw_wcB  4.) Read this book: http://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness/dp/1572246952/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433878831&sr=8-1&keywords=buddha%27s+brain  5.) Be kind to yourself. :)"

So many of us, however, have simply failed to allow ourselves to dream at all, afraid of never reaching the goal or too caught up in the 9-5 drudgery to even stop and question what we are doing and where we are going. The point is, when you have seen life taken from those you love in their youth, you quickly realize that life is far too short.  What is the prize at the end?  Why wait for tomorrow to do something you really want to do today?  Even if you must work harder than anyone else to achieve it, even if you must make enormous sacrifices to make it happen, would you rather take your last breath in this life knowing you left nothing on the table or feeling only regret for what you never took a chance on, what you never made time for?"

I tried it for a while with a beaded bracelet I had and wow, it really did help me realize how often I complained. The bracelet I used didn't have the stinging ""snap"" factor of an elastic band but it still helped with my awareness. Having to switch wrists was an annoying chore I wanted to avoid, especially in the presence of other people.

I couldn't say that they were inside of me our outside of me - there didn't seem to be a difference.  I don't share that a lot because it sounds funny, and I have only found fleeting references to others experiencing/speaking of the same thing.  Prior to that, I was leery about talk of ""energy"" and ""vibrations"" but now I know, we really don't know everything.  Yes, be wary of the flakes who just seem to be making up deep and sciency-sounding stuff. They do so much damage.  But... odd things that we don't notice or are not always aware of are part of our world.  Anyway, take for what it's worth.

ZenHabits,38aul9,Bombjoke,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"Hearing you describe your experience is far more convincing then listening to you confidently explaining what happened to you as an authority on vibration.  Tolle kinda goes off the deep end when he gets to the jesus chapter. just picking and choosing bible quotes to support his theory without any backup. ie- from that point you can see that he created a nice little belief system and wants to support it (if not capitalize on it), which is different than the intro which leads one to believe he is just reporting what happened to him and how anyone can benefit from it. he should stick to the things he knows from personal experience and exclude his theories and those of other gurus he hung out with unless making it clear thats what they are.  so now the unsubstantiated claims just keep dribbling out on every page where earlier on there was a reasonable progression of practical ideas reintroducing buddhism in a nonreligious context. ultimately his message is to practice being mindful all the time, as many minutes per day as possible, so you get better at it and can keep it up for longer, and then youll see that this was the right thing to do. and youll see that this is our better natural state, as opposed to living with the illusion you are the person you think you are when you say, ""I"" in your head. the ""I"" illusion actively tries to keep itself alive by telling you that you are it. so if you feel like you are you, then that is proof that you have this kinda virus which cleverly disguises itself as you, making you think you are you, when actually there is no you since Being is Being and we are all Being. as long as you think you're a you, you have the problems that you have and cannot escape them. to escape, you have to deflate the entire you until it's gone. and you do that by being present, not letting the virus keep dragging you into thoughts about the future or the past. by staying in the present. but the virus doesnt want to let you stay in the present because he fears for his life (and remember, he's making you think he is you- so it's you that gets afraid) so he fights against you staying in the moment which gradually leads to your realization that youre not him, that youre not a you at all, that youre just pure being, which feels great. this much i kinda go along with.  although his position differs from the science of mindfulness i like by advocating that you ultimately shouldnt use your mind any more than necessary, like a cool justified tool just for certain purposes. that the default state should be in the moment, not using your mind. whereas the clinical position is that being mindful regularly, and putting the mind on hold, is good to do, but the defualt state throughout your day and life would obviously be with your brain turned on, thinking most of the time. this author though, says that living with your brain on by defualt is like leaving the tv on all the time (my analogy), maybe comforting, but unnatural, and not doing anyone any good, and if fact, could be argued, doing harm on a mass scale if all of civilization is doing it, which they are.  someone should rewrite his book, leaving out the lame new agey words. it came in the late 90s. come on. it was grunge time. technology time. and he is still using guru phrases.  It also makes me uncomfortable that he always wanted to be guru, and he even changed his name to that of his personal favorite guru.  I did enjoy the first half, and his story in the first chapter."

Unaware/Passive: Go into a job interview that you think was a ""great opportunity for you"", and wait for the phone call for three weeks before moving on.   Aware/Active: Bring the first project you'd like to work on with that company to the interview and ask some questions about ""how it might be a great fit"" for you. Make sure this is a place you can do good work for, and if not, say no thank you in the interview.   Passive: Someone says annoying comments to you and you ignore it, letting it bubble up inside you.   Active: As soon as someone says something you don't appreciate, ask them so politely with a smile not to do that, in front of a group. Can you imagine you saying that with full confidence and care about that person?   Being aware is about accepting things as they are. Someone was mean to you. Being active after awareness means choosing if you want to let that effect you or not, and how.  There's this great story about buddha and the gift. I tell my girlfriend all the time ""don't accept that persons gift"".  Basically, while the buddha was travelling, he was approached by an angry man who threw insults at him until he was out of breath, while the buddha just smiled.   The buddha's apprentice at the time, Ananda I think, said, ""Why didn't you defend yourself? Fight back? That guy just roasted ya!""   Buddha says, ""When someone approaches you with a gift, and you do not accept it, who does that gift still belong to?"" That man hurt no one but himself with his anger.  Don't receive ""gifts"" from life, good or bad, if you don't want them."

It mattered zero to him. And it wasn't expressed in a selfish way, but more in the sense that he was incapable of feeling embarrassed. He never missed out on something or shied away from something because he worried about others' opinions or worried he would look foolish. He was a very successful businessman and I believe that quality was a huge benefit to him over the years. He made decisions based on what was rational or ethical... never based on popular opinion or what others expected/wanted him to do. And he was also absolutely amazing at telling jokes because he simply could not feel embarrassment. When he told jokes, people would cry-laugh from enjoying not just the joke, but how ridiculous he made himself in telling the joke. He had no fear in that respect.

I don't think that is an accurate likening. Empathy is the ability to accurately predict or understand how another consciousness is feeling. It's true that this can lead to difficulty in making practical decisions and the book tries to highlight this pragmatism as benefitial.

This is what is meant by ""cold empathy"" vs. ""warm empathy.""  One study showed psychopaths are better at picking up microexpressions. Another study showed psychopaths are especially good at picking up on other people's negative emotions (like fear).  Empathy (and ""emotional intelligence"") are just tools for understanding others. They don't automatically lead to moral behaviors.

Now stop doing that, and watch TV instead. 2. Skip the opening and closing credits because they're not important. Also fast-forward through any boring parts.    It's a pretty generic strategy for how to do more of anything really."

ZenHabits,382lq4,endhalf,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:28:59 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that the calculation of additional time is absurd.  âCutting out just one hour of television a day creates an extra 365 hours per year to accomplish whatever is most important to you. Thatâs over nine additional 40-hour workweeks â 2 months of additional time!â  They are equating a workweek (5 days of 8 hours each) to an actual full week (7 days of 24 hours each).  365 hrs / 24 hrs = 15.21 days of additional time.   LIES!!!
ZenHabits,384zf5,simonalexanderong,2,Mon Jun 1 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"There are physical-mental limits as well if that makes sense. Rock climbing, specifically big-wall climbing, continually lets you push through your mental-physical boundaries to reach new peaks, pun intended.   Nothing. Not meditation or yoga that I've tried puts me in the moment more than climbing. All those thoughts you try to ignore while sitting or in savasanna don't even have the opportunity to materialize. The only thing that matters when climbing is where your feet and hands are and where the next hold is."

If I do that I won't understand anything that's going on, the subject is too complex for me to be thinking about mindfulness, either I pay 100% attention to the material or I fall behind, fast.   I'm no expert, but as I understand it, mindfulness is about focusing on the matter at hand - whatever you're doing in the moment.  In calculus class, focusing on the lesson (paying 100% attention to the material) would be mindful, while thinking about mindfulness would not be mindful."

ZenHabits,37cupx,Omgwhatsthatsmell,3,Wed May 27 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"hey /u/Omgwhatsthatsmell, i'm the author of this post, and i disagree with you. i think traveling is far more available than most people think, especially for those of us lucky enough to be born in affluent countries.  sooner or later your child will be 18 and will have to fend for themselves. at that point you could save up as little as ~$1500, buy a plane ticket for ~$700 (to wherever would be the cheapest place to fly into in asia) and do exactly what i did. if i needed to, i could live on ~$300/month in Vietnam or Cambodia. it's insanely cheap. there are numerous ways you could find work to earn money or work in exchange for a place to stay and food to eat.   WorkAway and HelpX are great resources for doing just that. i also talked about some other ways of earning money while traveling here:  http://www.refinethemind.com/earn-a-living-while-traveling-abroad/  ultimately, i think telling yourself that only a lucky few get to travel is a self-sabotaging strategy, possibly based on some deep-down fear of leaving your comfort zone and entering the unknown, or perhaps some deep-seated sense of inadequacy, or feeling that you don't deserve such an experience.  if you look at the facts of the situation, it's never been easier and more accessible to travel abroad. it can cost a fraction of what most people spend each month living in major US cities. if you really want to make it happen, make it happen when the time is right."

It's really funny because I see the surprise sometimes when people who work at the movies see I have a family! (Probably because they are horrified this mom goes off to the movies alone--who takes care of the kids? If my husband and I want to see a movie, we go alone on successive nights and then compare notes.)  But I'd prefer to go to a museum alone--and I definitely love eating dinner alone. I've even enjoyed going to bars alone if they have comfy chairs and wifi. I like taking walks alone, going to museums alone and when I travel for work alone I'm pretty psyched to spend days on end alone in a  hotel. I love being alone.  I can't be the only one. True, I'm married with kids. But even when I didn't have kids and I was single and so alone as they say I sometimes would happily spend the entire weekend alone and then be sad when I'd have to go back to work and talk to people.   What's the issue with doing things alone? Are people embarrassed like it looks like they have no friends? Or do they only enjoy things with company?"

ZenHabits,373dhf,VibrantKai,1 point,Mon May 25 16:26:00 2015 UTC,Or do they only enjoy things with company?   For me it's a combination of that and having people to talk about/share things with afterwards. For eating or going to bars it's just much more fun to have people to talk to than to sit there by yourself. For movies or museums it's nice to have someone to discuss or share what you're exited or interested in.  But I do like taking long walks alone.

You are free to walk past things you don't want to see, linger at the stuff you enjoy more, take a break in the sunshine when you're tired or just want to people watch.

As far as I can recall, many philosophies define peace as balance. That is, balance between ""good"" and ""bad"" events/feelings/whathaveyou. Peace is the ability to sidestep external events and accept life, come what may. Harmony doesn't necessarily mean that no harm befalls no one and nothing. Harmony is, again, a balance in the system; that the cows survive, but don't eat so much grass that it never grows back. Am I making any sense?"
ZenHabits,36yvhb,Arn_Thor,1 point,Sat May 23 09:22:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this makes sense. Thanks for your ideas :D  Still, when examining situations in which one must make a choice or take a degree of agency, the question remains: what choice will promote the greatest degree of ""peace"" (even if it means ""balance"").  Is there an easy way to determine how much of her crops she should let the crows eat? If it's ""none"", the crows may die. Outside of a degree of omniscience (knowing the exact impact of crows and somehow making the choice that maximizes the survival and well-being of all parties), how can we approach this?"
ZenHabits,36yvhb,HiddenUnicorn,1 point,Sat May 23 11:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think she could leave none of the crops for the crows, as they seemingly existed before her garden and as such there must have been a food source. Although this does create a problem as it's possible that the assumption is false and in leaving none would kill the crows. In that sense I think she would have to leave as much so that she could live comfortably, because ensuring her own safety would also ensure that of the crows to an extent as she tends the garden."

The question ""Why do my inner state depends of the way things in the outer world evolve ?"" is a way to learn to see through the deception, and to perceive the built of the illusion that makes you suffer eternaly.  There is something greater to achieve than reaching victory. No matter how big your victory is, it will never be enough to maintain your mind in peace. Only the absence of the polar system defeat / victory can. That's a different work, requiring different tools. And amongst other side, practising yourself on that path requires you to live defeats and failures."

Â   In the shadows of an autumn evening,  I fell for a seamstress  still at her machine in the tailorâs window,  and later for a bowl of broth,  steam rising like smoke from a naval battle.  Â   This is the best kind of love, I thought,  without recompense, without gifts,  or unkind words, without suspicion,  or silence on the telephone.  Â   The love of the chestnut,  the jazz cap and one hand on the wheel.  Â   No lust, no slam of the door â  the love of the miniature orange tree,  the clean white shirt, the hot evening shower,  the highway that cuts across Florida.  Â   No waiting, no huffiness, or rancor â  just a twinge every now and then  Â   for the wren who had built her nest  on a low branch overhanging the water  and for the dead mouse,  still dressed in its light brown suit.  Â   But my heart is always propped up  in a field on its tripod,  ready for the next arrow.  Â   After I carried the mouse by the tail  to a pile of leaves in the woods,  I found myself standing at the bathroom sink  gazing down affectionately at the soap,  Â   so patient and soluble,  so at home in its pale green soap dish.  I could feel myself falling again  as I felt its turning in my wet hands  and caught the scent of lavender and stone.  Â    Billy Collins"

And to that effect, I try to ask questions about the person I'm conversing with, and try to make the conversation as much about them as possible. Not only do other people love talking about themselves, but I always develop a sense of wonder hearing people talking about their passions. It's a really great feeling."

ZenHabits,36dq4d,dillpiccolol,1 point,Mon May 18 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"I clicked through, expecting to find something a little deeper. The suggestions are good, but are more akin to ""home maintenance"" than personal habits of home owners that lead to highly effective outcomes. What I would suggest in their place: 1. Time Value of Money -- paying more than your minimum monthly mortgage will result in thousands of dollars of freed revenue later in life because you will be paying down the principal of your loan faster (I.e. not just the interest). The earlier you put in a little more, the higher the impact over the life of the loan. 2. If you need to do a costly project on your home (reshingle the roof, update kitchen, etc.) try getting a loan on your car instead of taking on credit card debt or even a 2nd mortgage. The rates are usually really good (3% on a 60 month loan right now!) and there is less paperwork than a 2nd mortgage. 3. If you have a spare room or mother-in-law suite, consider renting it out via AirBnB. You can charge about twice the rate as your area's rental market rate, and keep the schedule open for when family and friends visit, so you get income AND a spare bedroom."

I think this pretty clearly indicates it isn't a matter of self-control. I think a more likely basis is different life paradigms. As in, more intelligent people seek out more abstracted forms of pleasure (the bad habits relate to mind altering activities.)  As a result, this assertion makes the whole infogram seem less like an unbiased, well thought out assertion. It reads more like someone who sees their self as intelligent (and most likely true to some degree) wanted to make a poster that validates their own personal struggles.

No distractions, no radio or books or writing just you and your mind and body.   For the first three days you'll practice concentration. Goenka, the man who does the discourses nightly, has a specific pali term for it. So basically you just sit and focus on the physical feeling  of breath. They say that's the hardest time and when most people quit.   After the three days you'll move into feeling sensations around the body when a certain level of concentration can be held. Vipassana is about the wisdom of impermanence. Every pain, every thought, every feeling you'll ever have is impermanent. The atoms in the walls are shifting, the cells in our body. We latch onto those and pretend they're never going to change by concepts and thoughts, put rather poorly. If you can watch them arise and fall you can free yourself from the attachment and aversion. Most people feel ""negative"" feelings and fight them, or cling to positive.   On my sixth day I felt that fully. Back aching, hating the whole thing, the discourse was stupid goenka was crazy, couldn't sit still through the pain. Just all around a grumpy  mess and thinking it was bs.   At this point there's 1 hour sessions where he urges ya not to shift around, so I decided to try my will at that. And what do you know, the pain became my friend, in a sense. Just a plain old feeling that wasn't bothersome and an overwhelming sense of peace. It was close to an out of body experience. There's a name for it, it's really all outlined. Of course, I got attached to it. A common but big problem that prevents yourself from getting there very easily again. When the feeling started arising I got excited. Doesn't work that way.   Nothing too bad popped up. I realised I've been a bit of a jerk off to people. But I've always been honest and didn't lie or gossip or steal or anything. Greed was my demon. Power.   They say negative experiences will likely come up. My friend was super in denial about herself and actions and ended up crying her eyes out. She said it was one of the hardest thing she's ever had to do. Sitting after these thoughts you're supposed to simply watch them, and you can with the smaller ones. But you can have big ones that knock you on your ass. Leaving my family without visiting or calling after how much they did for me was one of mine that hit me hard.  Anyways it's all completely different depending. All I can say is don't fight what pops up. That's shit that lingers down there in your subconscious and weighs ya down. Maybe you won't have anything pop up. I've talked to some people who said they got nothing. Work hard, don't give up. And don't worry about some weird shit goenka says haha. Four Elements pop into mind. His teachings of the actual meditation practice and way are put well. I found myself wanting to discredit him when I was down.   Typed this up quickly and probably poorly. Prob more info than ya needed haha. Feel free to ask anything"

How long had you been meditating before this, and did you do it casually like I do, or were you more serious about it? How did you feel after you finished the course? Were there any long-lasting effects, or at least some POV changes?  Basically tell me your life story lol."
ZenHabits,366ac3,Dan-Man,1 point,Sun May 17 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"Lol.   So I kinda went on a tangent reliving my last few years. I'll bold where I get to the meditation course and your questions.   Well.. I was in University fretting my life. I had just finished up my third year in health sciences and had the realization working in the field I was studying wasn't what I wanted my life to be about. I had no passion or drive for anything in my life. So I chose to take a year off and do something different.   Looking back, it was a mistake to believe career was what life was about, but I has a much smaller view of what existence is about back then. I was going with the normal flow. School, uni, career, house, kids, retirement, die.   Anyways. Six months after deciding to take that year off (now on my third) I chose to get into self development. Mostly to pick up girls, addmitingly. They stress developing yourself and your life as a way to happiness and in turn ladies. The forum recommended mindfulness in plain English. So I downloaded the free e book (Def recommend) and went to town reading.   It was weird and confusing. It seemed stupid. But I got to the section about what to do with the body and mind and started sitting. The first week I got into a deep concentration state and felt free for the first time (sober) in a while, so right then I knew I was gonna pursue  this path.   And there was my first lesson. Strive for States and they won't come. It took a good seven months before I could get to that level of concentration again. Seriously.   Of course, I didn't meditate too seriously. Aimed at twenty a day. Most days I'd get it. Some weeks I'd stop and feel worse. I took to blaming the meditation practice instead of my hectic lifestyle, in those seven months I lived in 4 places for at least a month and had 3 jobs and a stint of unemployment that had me broke and living in a hostel. Stressful times. I do think it's a lot more manageable when meditating, though.   Anyways.. Meditation started going crazy well with a stable job and living situation. No stress, no anxiety, everything seemed under control. People just couldn't get under my skin, nothing bothered me. Joyful. Working 12 hours a day labouring  6 days a week and kinda digging my life. The world seemed huge and open and anything was possible.  I booked a one way ticket to South east Asia to adventure there.   Then I got sucked into drinking and that lifestyle when work got slow. Meditation didn't seem important because my mind was so clear and I was so stable. Why did I need it again?  of course my anxieties and fears and laziness came back in full. So did the striving for what I had.   right to your questions  after this  Went to a music festival.  I was meditating trying to curb my anxieties that were overwhelming me. When I was done I noticed a guy was around and we got to chatting. He recommended ten day course in the province. I thought nothing of it at the time.   A Few weeks pass and I'm still feeling average. Nothing bad, just not the guy with no anxiety who seemed to feel free and know himself. It was similar to how I acted before when going to university. Of course, I got a taste of freedom and wanted more, so I was striving. Got back serious into meditation to fix me.  That doesn't work. You need to be okay with your life and things slowly change. Violent striving won't do.   So around that time I applied for a course a month or so before my flight.  The reasoning was a ten day course would fix me up good before the trip, and I'd be fine and dandy.   This.. This is dumb way to go into it man. You'll want to go in with an open mind. I was so focused on fixing myself I spent half my time thinking about how my life is going to change. How easy it is to do speeches in front of people and love and be open and this and that. I kinda got addicted to the high and thinking narrowly.   When I came out I was more or less the same. Calmer for sure.   I learned a few key things, as I said above, but it wasn't life changing.   A lot of great things happened since. I fell off so many times though and I don't know where I'm at now. For the last while I l was chasing  women and money and respect. Losing all friendliness in my pursuit of being cool.. It was clearly coming from a place of insecurity.   Realising and seeing myself I took a step back and that's where I'm at now. I feel a bit lost, as far as connecting to people goes. Friendliness just isn't there. It feels like I'm guarding myself from people.   Slowly that ego will fade again.   So uhh..   *tldr: mindfulness in plain English. Daily practice and a life without gossip and ego and hate will start to change your life and those around you. True confidence will shine through.   The ten day isn't a magic trip. It's hard as fuck. You'll learn if you keep an open mind. Easier said than done.   Meditation for the sake of a high is cool and all but won't help change your view. It'll just get ya high.*  I wrote so much I don't know lol. Not gonna look it over. I'm pretty lethargic. Hope it was somewhat on point."

I've been trying to meditate regularly but I find that I always make some lame excuse not to - too much work to do, too tired, too lazy, too anxious. And I know it'd help me out a lot but there you go. I've been wanting to do something like this course for a while - a dive-into-the-deep-end meditation getaway - cause I feel it'd help me to be taught by an actual teacher and to be forced to do it sans excuses.   I'm sure it's not going to be easy, but that's why I want to do it.  Thanks for your replies though!"

As far as my shitty medical school goes, it has me rotating at two of the best hospitals in New Jersey right now, so, I'm pretty content. As to why I talk about it so much, it's because if you do well in medical school (as I do) that's usually all you have time for. Maybe you're not too busy so that you have time to pay attention to sports or whatever, but we really don't.  Medicine and the medical field is very complicated, so it's perfectly acceptable that you don't understand the nuances of the educational system it encompasses.   Have a nice day."

I love how in 90% of your posts, you like to emphasize the fact that you go to your shitty no-name medical school when most of the time, it's not even necessary to mention it.  It just tells me you have a massive ego, you are a show-off, a narcissist and someone who gets off by praising themselves."
ZenHabits,367c96,fap_to_Lollipoppy,0,Thu May 21 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"I like talking about medicine because that's all I really get to do with my life. Same reason why guys who work out talk about the gym or guys that play soccer talk about their sports teams or anything like that. I don't know what you do with your life but mine and everybody I go to school with are pretty focused. So, it's understandable why you'd get that impression.  As for my shitty no-name medical school, it's the single largest supplier of doctors to the United States, we have people in every field of medicine, about 1/3 graduates becomes chief resident at their program, we have internationally recognized professors based from our school and internationally recognized visiting professors giving lectures for weeks at a time. As far as any other argument you might have as to why my school is so shitty, articulate them and we can have a conversation, but you just seem bored and angry the way you've handled it in the past.  Do I have an ego? Yeah, I do, and if I laid out all the things I've done in my life big and small scope I think it's pretty deserved, that being said, I don't shove it in anybody's face in person and overwhelmingly play it down face to face, so I like to talk about it here and there on the internet instead. I think that's not the worst fault someone could have in life. If I was a narcissist I'd lack that introspection and just get angry and defensive. If I was a shitty student from a shitty school, I wouldn't be teaching american medical students pathology, physiology, or anatomy, but I've done that plenty, and at their request, not my own force or suggestion.   Let me know if you have anything substantial to add. Your thought process hasn't really evolved over the course of our interaction but now that I remember you, I have enjoyed hearing you rant, so let me know if you want to keep talking :)"

I'll consider that in the future. If I'm reading a post about bridges, I would be interested to hear an engineer's perspective and know they have the background to be more knowledgeable on the subject than the guy who watched one youtube video about construction and uses that to preach on here, so I appreciate others stating their qualifications and I reflect that myself.

It could be anything from a goal I accomplished, a good deed I did, a person I encountered, something I learned or even just something beautiful I saw.   I've struggled with recurring depression in my life, and I read in a book that negative pathways in the mind, once formed, are reinforced by any negative or even neutral experience. In order to ""reprogram"" the mind, it's important to reinforce the neural networks that emphasize optimism and pleasure. It could all be a bunch of BS, but I find it's a helpful habit.    I also suffer (unsurprisingly) from anxiety, so at times when I'm feeling very anxious, I'll describe the feeling, as one author put it, like ""a fine wine"" -- the particular characteristics, the physical feelings, the recurring thoughts.  This has, strangely, a calming effect, especially when I can look at all the previous experiences that seemed so catastrophic and yet by not allowing myself to be paralyzed by that fear, I almost always persevered."

ZenHabits,35ukvz,BHoss,5,Wed May 13 21:28:57 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I did keep a diary of a sort for basically venting out and writing about things that are bothering/annoying and all the things going wrong.  Then looking back at it to see how much changes.  But your idea is more positive! Hah.  Definitely gonna try it!
ZenHabits,35ukvz,theotheroversounds,5,Thu May 14 01:58:42 2015 UTC,This is awesome.  Any android users have an alternate app to grid diary?
ZenHabits,35ukvz,catorda,6,Wed May 13 23:37:59 2015 UTC,"I just downloaded Graditude Journal. It's looks really nice and simple. However it does not have all the features that Grid Diary for iOS does. It only have the ""today I am grateful for..."" entries. You can not make your own cards/categories."
ZenHabits,35ukvz,trolle,5,Thu May 14 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, which app did you use? Thank you for posting!"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,berkbrew,1 point,Wed May 13 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"I used ""grid diary"" on iOS. The free version is great, but it's well worth the price of the paid version too."
ZenHabits,35ukvz,PollyLove,3,Wed May 13 23:20:11 2015 UTC,"This looks really reflective and useful! I've made my first entry for today. I really enjoyed reading your results and explanations, too. Thanks for posting :)"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,abe-solotely-alive,3,Wed May 13 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"This is a sweet post. Thank you.  Edit: Did you find these questions somewhere, or did you brainstorm them yourself?"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,kylificent,1 point,Thu May 14 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"I came up with them myself. Basically I just thought about all the things in my life I was neglecting/ignoring. At first I didn't even think much would come of it. I just wanted to stop ignoring my bad habits and my feelings. I don't know if most other people do this thing where they say, ""I can't really remember what I did today so I guess it wasn't really important."" But I found myself saying it a lot. I guess this was just an introductory lesson in mindfulness :)"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,janet-eugene-hair,3,Thu May 14 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"Another suggestion is to experiment with different ""diaries."" Maybe it's an app, maybe it's a leather bound journal, maybe a journal with one of those uplifting quotes. For me, I prefer a good ol' spiral notebook. I had a hard time with ""keeping a diary"" or ""journaling."" It's just a silly perspective thing but I found that with a spiral notebook I just called it ""writing"" & was far more inclined to keep it up."
ZenHabits,35ukvz,hi-wow-bye,2,Thu May 14 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent practice -- glad to hear you're improving your quality of life. I do something similar -- I make my own weekly planner out of a blank journal. For each 2-page spread, the top half is a weekly calendar, and the bottom half is for notes, goals, lists, questions, etc. You can go back through it over time and see things you forgot, review past ideas, etc. Plus you can draw in it, never need to recharge it, and it doesn't hurt your eyes if you look at it for too long! :)"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,CartoonMotion,2,Wed May 13 21:46:26 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this suggestion! I just downloaded a diary app on my laptop and plan on answering questions every night. I stole some of yours :) Mine are:   What did I dream about last night? What did I eat today? How much money did I spend? What am I grateful for? Did I do anything productive? Am I avoiding doing something? Did I learn anything new today? Goals for tomorrow? Anything memorable happen today?
ZenHabits,35ukvz,TearsOfTheRiver,2,Thu May 14 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Awww thanks, I'm flattered :)"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,OmniscientOCE,2,Thu May 14 12:34:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing! I keep a weekly planner of all the things I need to get done, but I've failed to keep a dairy to keep track of what I've actually done. So much of my evening is spent thinking about all the things I didn't accomplish, I think keeping a diary and using your questions as a guideline will help me focus of what I've actually done (physically & mentally) throughout the day, so I can feel somewhat proud of myself. Thanks again!"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,kik369,2,Thu May 14 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"thank you for this, i've been struggling to keep a diary too."
ZenHabits,35ukvz,the_khadus,2,Thu May 14 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"I really like the ""What information did I learn?"" question. Since I'm in school I think doing something like this could definitely help me, same with the health questions. I'm gonna take it and work on some of my own questions. Thanks heaps for this post!"
ZenHabits,35ukvz,octoberguy,2,Thu May 14 08:11:13 2015 UTC,What is a good diary app for Android that could be accessed from Web as well?
