Drifting,3e3a58,jrcanes555,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:49 2015 UTC,what happened to make you crash? You were doing so well too!  You have lots of angle on your left handers but not so much on the right. Is that a driver thing or a setup thing?
Drifting,3e3a58,protomor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"The car kept bogging on that last corner and I was trying to get third gear. By the time I got it to spin I was already halfway down the main hill, the car picked up to much speed and I just slid wide and into the ditch.   As far as the angle, It's more of a course issue than driver or angle. You can't really see the terrain changes in the video but that track is a lot smaller than it looks and there are three pavement changes on top of a large elevation change. basically you can fly into that bottom corner throw a lot of angle and be good to go, but when you make it back up to the top it's sealed pavement, and off camber so you have to feather it through until you start to move back down the hill. Then you can lay back into it."

It depends on the size of the bag and where your height is set..if you let all the air out and slam it then ya it rides like mush, but at your standard set height it is still stiff (for most popular makes of bag kits for stanced out cars..not lowriders/trucks etc."

Drifting,3dvdkc,protomor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I ask because it was such a change. The car actually put power down running the 205/50R15 Kuhmo XS's I bought.

Drifting,3dvdkc,Drift_Kar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"If its been like this the whole time since you had it welded then its probably just got more weld on on side than the other which makes it unbalanced and thus vibrate.  If you think the welds have come off (which they shouldn't if welded properly) then check the fluid and see if its full of metal bits. My friends diff exploded once but that was because it was welded so badly, and the smaller gears (cant think of the name right now) just exploded and he lost drive.  Also it could be the gearbox if you are only feeling it in 2nd and 3rd?"

Drifting,3dvdkc,Nigel_Vertigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"The vibration or noise i would guess would be your tyres/suspension. A welded diff is either working or not. Once the welds break (If they break) it will just tear everything inside the casing apart or jam locked.    Crunching could be the suspension mounts bending and getting loose, Diff mounts, shafts if the diff moves at all.    Best thing to do is jack the rear up and give the wheels a wiggle, drain the fluid check for metal bits (Reuse the fluid if its clean) mounts etc...    Also check the prop it might be wearing out a bit.    Now if everything seems fine test the gearbox. You might've lost some teeth if you stressed the box to much."

Drifting,3dsg53,THEHERMANN8TER,7,Sun Jul 19 02:06:05 2015 UTC,there already dropping pretty hard. Theres some on Clist as low as 7k and for that you get a much more powerful (albeit heavier) car. The 370z caused a large drop in the value of the 350.
Drifting,3dsg53,BIGSxNPTACTIX19,6,Sun Jul 19 02:58:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. They won't drop as low as 240's were before the drift scene for a while. But a 350z is also a step up from a 240 so I assume they'll retain their value and eventually experience their own drift tax.
Drifting,3dsg53,THEHERMANN8TER,5,Sun Jul 19 03:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah , they'll probably depreciate similar to the 300zx. Which it is a Z car so that makes sense"

Drifting,3dsg53,Throreo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:24:11 2015 UTC,"SN95 are solid rear axle cars and won't be good drifters. They are already a dime a dozen and will remain in obscurity in the drift scene until a good cheap aftermarket IRS is available. Which won't happen until there's a demand for it, and there won't be a demand for it until people drift them in large numbers. Catch 22. You can get a Cobra or swap the rear of one, but even then there's only so many Cobras out there.   BMWs are a good option, but I'm betting most will be swapped (I'm not a fan of putting a V8 in everything) since replacement parts are so pricey.   350Zs have dropped in price nicely, have a strong aftermarket, and are a good option.   As someone else said blown motor RX8s are cheap and its a competent chassis, so a good swap candidate or cheap rebuild if you do mods to make it more reliable and know how to treat a rotary properly.   Miatas are on the uptick for amateurs, but I don't think the chassis is good enough for pro.   On one hand I think 240 rarity is a myth, they sold a little over 250,000 of them here and drifting is a drop in the bucket. On the other hand I'm all for it as I'd like more variety at events."
Drifting,3dsg53,protomor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:13 2015 UTC,Someone in this thread already mentioned this but why not older rx7's?  It is easy to find a decent FC or FB in the 1000 to 5999 price range.  Is it because rotary engines are harder to work on?  Or are the cars themselves harder to drift?
Drifting,3dsg53,TommyyyGunsss,0,Sun Jul 19 13:55:20 2015 UTC,SN95s are solid rear. IMO they will never be a good platform. Fox bodies had a chance but never caught on. I foresee 350zs and bmws taking over. E36s have hit their prime. I think E46s are next.   Edit: Maybe RX8s if sikky can finish that ls kit.
Drifting,3dsg53,protomor,0,Wed Jul 22 00:25:17 2015 UTC,Rear axle is perfectly fine for drifting.... It's only at a disadvantage on bumpy ass roads that you shouldn't be drifting on either way.

Drifting,3dl6p4,Dubloverism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:17:11 2015 UTC,Garbage for this type of thing.  It's a panasonic Lumix FZ70.  Bought it before I became interested in shooting this type of stuff the proceeded to realize how unsuited it was for the paces I've been trying to put it through.  I was looking at a Nikon D5300 as a good starter dslr.
Drifting,3dl6p4,subtle_trex,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:17 2015 UTC,I would recommend a Canon DLSR over a Nikon for video. I would look into a T3i/T4i. Good price point for both. I originally shot my videos with a Canon 60D and that's comparable to both those cameras (the T4i is slightly better image quality).

A higher caliber car will be capable of more with equal drivers. I would venture to say the FD guys could probably switch cars with your average pro am guy and ride their door in tandem. Even with the huge car gap.

Ultimately your tires determine more than anything else. More power allows you to push the limits further with better tires allowing snappier recovery and smoother transitions. Suspension gets everything dialed in. You have to really know your car and set up to do well."

Drifting,3d7186,sifadula,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:44:21 2015 UTC,"Strictly about ""keeping up"" - HP is key. You can't magically make a slower car go faster. Unless the guy in front messes up.  I'm gonna say your friend isn't very good at drifting. Take an ok setup car and drift 4 or 5 consecutive turns with good angle and tell me it doesn't take much skill. Power doesn't make the car drive well. Power makes you go faster. But when you're faster, everything happens much faster too."
Drifting,3d7186,protomor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"You 100% can make a slower car catch a faster car if the car with more power has a terrible alignment and no side bite, HP is not key sideways traction is key and some people never address this issue."

Drifting,3d7186,tbulls123,0,Tue Jul 14 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"At the top level in the USA, it's more about the car at this point.

Drifting,3d7186,Diesel33g,0,Tue Jul 14 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"It takes skill, money, and commitment.  Just like any form of racing.

Your friend sounds like a peckerhead."
Drifting,3d7186,OhMyGodfather,-4,Wed Jul 15 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"Competitive drifting is not as skillful if you compare it to Formula 1, Rally, Time Attack (imo). But entry speed, initiation, and imitating lines is very skillful. Drifting itself (i.e holding slides and transitioning) is not skillful. If you are really trying to push yourself to the next level of driving skill, drifting will limit you. But if you want to have fun behind a wheel of a car. Drifting is that."

Drifting,3d4zgj,AS14K,4,Mon Jul 13 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"I've never seen the aftermath of someone actually making one of these kinds of purchases, so either spending 30k on a first drift car is a really good idea or they finish school and real life kicks them in the balls.  Save the e30s/s13s though, get an mx5/miata as a first car. Decent E30s are getting less common now, same for the straight S13s. Mazda built about 182 million mx5s worldwide, so there's plenty of those that you can crash and not care about (plus they cost approximately chocolate bar money, which is great)"

Drifting,3d4zgj,5t4k3,9,Mon Jul 13 17:59:15 2015 UTC,Even if you were 30 making loads it would be a terrible idea to purchase a brand new car for 30k with the intent to drift it. You'll end up with a totalled car and no money to buy a new one. Just get a significantly cheaper car and save the extra for stuff you'll need. Like a new car when you crash this one..

Working hard for a 370z will make it feel a lot worse when it does something unexpected and you put it in a wall, or smash some bodywork. Just trying to help you avoid that nasty gut sinking feeling of ""...shit. That wasn't fun."" when you inevitably end up facing the wrong way in a bush and your bumper is smashed and your engine bay dust tray is hanging off as you pull out (I killed a thick hedge in my e46)  Spend the money on a nice car, but skid a shitter until you're sure it's for you, and that you can handle smashing something tidy."

For 5k you have yourself a drift car that you don't care about. Also, its not about HP when you are learning, the less the better, you have to learn control first!"
Drifting,3d4zgj,CompleteXen,0,Tue Jul 14 02:54:12 2015 UTC,I completely understand about less power more learning. I'm beginning to learn how to go sideways on dirt roads in a fusion hybrid.

Drifting,3d4zgj,CompleteXen,4,Tue Jul 14 06:49:27 2015 UTC,"dude no offense but you really arent learning anything in a fwd car on a dirt road. Its just not the same. Insurance is insurance, if its a car you dont care about then you dont need full coverage"
Drifting,3d4zgj,sasnettk,6,Wed Jul 15 02:28:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you the best advice I can. First off, as a new driver, spending $20k+ on any car that you will drift or race is not a smart idea. Because in an instant that car can be destroyed, and you will be stuck with the bill.   The best thing you can do is spend less money, improve your driving, and build up cars. Getting a better car as you gain experience. Buying a FRS or 370Z as a first car is okay, but if you plan to ever go sideways or to a track I highly recommend you think again about purchasing these cars. Having an expensive car will not make you any better at driving or faster. Are they cool cars? Yes they are. But there are many options for you to choose from that won't cost you $30,000.   If I was in the same situation, I would start with something less expensive and slightly older. Miata's are GREAT for spirited driving and track driving, not so much for drifting. There are other options such as E36/E46, MK3 Supra's, 240SX's, 300ZX's, S2000's the list goes on. These are great cars because they are relatively cheap, and can be built up as your driving skill increases.   Horsepower means nothing if your driving skill is unable to take advantage of it. Start small and work your way up. If you have $30,000, Spend $7,000 on a LOW mileage reliable sports car. With enough searching you can find MINT Miata's, 240SX's and E46's in that price range. Be smart and take your time. Buy used. You might like the idea of a brand new, untouched car. But it doesn't matter. Because those cars are a waste of an investment now.   TLDR: Be smart, don't buy an expensive car that has even a small chance of being damaged.    Sorry for the long post."
Drifting,3d4zgj,CompleteXen,2,Mon Jul 13 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting, and giving suggestions on what to buy instead of a new car.

Drifting,3d4zgj,sasnettk,4,Mon Jul 13 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"Showing off is awesome... If you have the money to do so. I'd love to show off a Lotus to my friends that I could technically afford, but Id be too scared to drive it properly. Learn to drive.   Also, screw what your friends think. Focus on you. Showing off is pointless. But learning how to become a better driver is extremely fun and rewarding.   Im currently building an S13 and Miata. The reason I'm building the S13 is because I damage the Miata which had.. 40,000 miles. I realized I should've gotten a cheaper car to damage than a beautiful low mileage Miata."

Drifting,3d4zgj,Dutchm0n,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:19:50 2015 UTC,In my experience you get ten times more attention and scene points driving a 240 than you do in a 370 or an frs. My 240 is bone stock and if a show up to a car meet it gets way more attention than souped up 370s.
Drifting,3d2ywc,timman42,5,Mon Jul 13 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"In my case, I needed a good way of mounting my rad, oil cooler, and intercooler. And a simple way of hanging the bumper cover once that was taken care of. I would say a good policy is to make it strong enough to blast a cone and shrug it off at 80mph, but not rigid enough that it would slice through your block in one piece with a hard wall hit. I think mone was made out of 1.25""OD DOM tubing.   1jz e36.   http://i.imgur.com/5jamDGB.jpg"
Drifting,3d2ywc,rapturedjesus,3,Mon Jul 13 03:25:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen lots of tube fronts. most people do it because it's cool and gives them more space to play with stuff. At the FD level, you'll see the frame cut back to the limits of the rule book. Then mounting plates are added on so you can easily replace the bars.    JR for instance has a 3 part bash system. The outer most system is aluminum. Then a steel bend in section. Then the actual tube frame. He also has nothing motor/rad/functional until you get to the main area (IE the aluminum and bash parts are expendable).   Remember that no amount of bash bar toodling will keep your frame from buckling in at 50mph."
Drifting,3d2ywc,protomor,2,Mon Jul 13 12:30:15 2015 UTC,"at the shop i work at we use the same tubing for crash bars/most of a tube front that we use for roll cages, which is 1.5"" .095 wall DOM.  you want the front crash bar to be strong, but to fail before affecting your frame. it's essentially replacing the factory bumper with something lighter and easily replaced. the purpose of a tube front, is that when a factory front core support is hit, the whole thing crumples up and becomes garbage. a tube front eliminates most of the ""junk"" metal and gives you the necessities. while also being much easier to rebuild and replace.  most people do tube fronts on cars that have already had the front core support smashed. again we use roll cage tubing for the bulk, with smaller round/flat stock for attaching things like heat exchangers and headlights.  try googling around and looking at other peoples tube front ends to  get an idea of how they're done."

Drifting,3d1uq2,Helzvog,18,Mon Jul 13 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna assume you're just new, and give you a real answer. To drift you need to have a car that's rear wheel drive, meaning the real wheels propel the car and the front wheels steer allowing the back end to wiggle when you lose traction. Aka. Drifting. Most Hondas are front wheel drive. Meaning the back end just kinda hangs around. Think of a front wheel drive car as the old guys dog in family guy. The back legs just drag behind. That said the only easily accessible rear wheel drive Honda is an s2000 but those are expensive. Most bmw's are rear wheel drive. Some nissans are. Think 240sx, 280z, 350z, 300zx, 240z. All older rear wheel drive nissans. Before you decide to try drifting. Study up."

So that doesn't leave much as far as toyotas. Unless he's in Japan and can have an altezza, or has easier access to a manual Cressida. Which are both cool sedans. And I actually did forget miatas, kinda skipped Mazda entirely. There's also the rx-7 and the rx-8 which can both be had cheap as dirt, just no torque. That said, if one can turn a wrench pretty decently, SR20 swapped rx-7's are decently simple and common and make for a pretty fast car. But you are right, miatas are cool. I started drifting an NB miata, they like to get sideways, you've just either got to hand brake, or really rip on it to get sideways. But they come with a factory lsd that I never had any issues drifting with. OP, go look at NB miatas. Something like a 2000. Buy it xxr's, $300 race land coils, slam it, and have fun. Don't worry about pretty ones. Just make sure it has the leather interior because that's the one with the lsd in it, and bitches love leather."

Drifting,3d1uq2,driftsc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:40:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this isn't a terrible idea. You don't need the lightest and sportiest and most JDM car to learn some basics of drifting or any skilled driving."

Drifting,3d1uq2,lost_in_reddit43,2,Mon Jul 13 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"If you're really that new to the concept of drifting, go play some forza and try things out there(use simulation settings). I'm not saying this to be a dick, I'm saying it because it will give you a little bit of an idea of how a car will behave, how different parts affect your vehicle, how terrain can change your car's behaviour, etc.   People hop in simulators to learn how to fly planes, and one of the drivers for Nissan's racing team has that position from a Gran Turismo training camp. Getting a feel for the mechanics of it in a sim before going out and breaking things on your car, can be worthwhile.   Anyway, older BMW's are plentiful but slightly expensive to maintain, jap cars in good condition are harder to find but parts are plentiful and generally cheap. Rear wheel drive is the drivetrain needed for drifting, front wheel drive doesn't work."
Drifting,3d1uq2,aroddalobster,2,Mon Jul 13 07:03:32 2015 UTC,"If you live in an area with an abundance of Volvo's. I'd  recommend getting a 240 for a starter drift missile. The redblock engine was used in the 200, 700, 900 series (meaning plenty of parts) and is very straight forward and can make easy power on the sohc (B234F). You'll have to weld the dif though. Only thing with the 240 is the suspension is quite floaty. Lowering springs and a stiffer sway bar would do the trick.   Volvo 240 - ~1500$ IPD camshaft - 220$ Lowering springs - 300$ Sway bar - 400$  That is a basic entry level missile.   Volvo for life!"

It's defiantly possible but why bother when there are so many more accessible platforms with a huge catalogue of aftermarket parts available.. These things had a solid rear axle didn't they ? Which in a car this heavy is not exactly going to be easy to recover once you break traction. It's a matter of momentum and physics and other factors that make handling a lighter car easier.  You could drift one and you certainly wouldn't be the first to try but it honestly looks like more of a family/luxury car. Nothing sporty about them.

I remember in 2004? When i saw drifting @ SEMA. I had watched it on bootleg dvd's and read about it in option/carboy mags. From day 1 i was sucked in.   When i heard about it was a debut at SEMA, i picked my spot 4 hours early, against a k rail, which was right against the track. To see all these cars slide past me, i was enthralled, bit by the bug. I tried to take pictures, but it was dark and i was caught up in the moment. So many drivers sliding inches from the front my my nose, doing some of the craziest driving... I try to bring that excitement every time i drive. I love looking out my side window, feeling the air rush past..  2--- Photographers that capture the moment.  Sometimes the feeling can last a split second. We all wish it could last for ever.  When the photographer takes the picture, it encapsulates all that. For the photographer, it may just be a pic. But for me, i remember the sights, the sounds, the smells, the feelings. So when you take a picture, it's not just a memory that is captured, but a moment...a moment in time that you saved, preserved and now are sharing.   Thank you photographers!"

I've run irwindale, willow springs, and can usually be found at Adams when money provides. A lot has changed in 16 years since i started following it, and 10 years since i got into the ""scene"".

Drifting,3clrw2,veryjuicyfruit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"Personally I am more into driving than the cars themselves. I love seeing a video that captures the essence of having fun with your car, or driving taken to the extreme. Not extreme like ""ha ha check out this reverse entry! Oh crap I missed the inside clipping point by a mile"" but extreme in the sense that it's done with mastery. I can enjoy a good video about a modded car as well, if the car is done with passion and character.  That said, the thing I like most about your videos is that they're honest. Many car videos these days (especially American ones, which I'm allowed to say because I'm an American) feel like they're trying to prove something to the viewer, but I haven't had that impression from any of your videos. I think this is because of your passion for what you capture. A lot of the Japanese drift videos are like this, too.  It reminds me of a TV series I'm watching right now called Macro Polo. You can probably guess who it's about, but in the show he is represented as having a way with words, describing things in a poetic way. Kublai Khan takes Marco into his court, and often uses him as his eyes. The Khan will tell him to go somewhere, and ""describe what you see, as you see it."" In this he means to choose the words that express what Marco saw; not the people and the houses and such, but what drew his gaze and captivated him. What were the important details about what he saw if he cut away everything else? To me that is true art. It doesn't come from nothing, it comes from seeing something in your own way and sharing that perspective with people.  The car videos I appreciate most are like this, yours among them. I feel like they are not meant to impress me, but to share your passion with me, to show me what you saw as you saw it.  I totally did not mean to write such a long-winded reply!

Drifting,3cklqq,Rommaster2,0,Thu Jul 9 04:33:39 2015 UTC,in Australia do they not have insurance that you can get agreed on amounts for reimbursement on modified cars? I ask just because if i had spent that much building it i would have sprung for theft coverage.
Drifting,3cklqq,Rus_s13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah we do, but insurance companies rarely will give you an agreed value that is a replacement cost.   In Australia these cars are usually imports and insurance companies usually charge out the ass for them. It was a track car, so im not sure it had regular street/theft insurance.    Also-  The guy was in the process of stripping the car and left it out the front of the workshop overnight, like a dickhead. I live in Brisbane, pretty close to where it happened.  Theft is a massive problem here and you'd have to be an idiot to leave that out overnight"

I'd have the price of the Truck, the price of a rolling s13 to strip the subframes, suspension arms, knuckles, brakes, steering etc, then the price of the engine/trans/ecu. Then the tube frame which you'd either have to make yourself or pay somebody 4k+ to build. add in cost of upgrades you'd want: coilovers, clutch, guages, ebrake, interior, tuning....

Drifting,3cdji0,M3_Drifter,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"Heres something i know about! A lot of drift organizations either outright don't allow trucks, or have rules stating that suspension mounts need to be in the factory location.  Generally trucks come with leaf springs and a solid axel from the factory which is obviously not ideal for drifting. So to make them handle better you swap subframes from a car with IRS and build custom shock towers to run coilovers. My truck is a Nissan D21 body. But in reality its a custom tube frame, with s13 240sx front and rear subframes, differential, axels, control arms, steering rack, etc.. And even with all the money, time, and effort we've put into our trucks, they still don't handle as well as a properly set up 240sx will. The balance is just not ideal.   Having said that, I'll also throw in that they are a blast to drive, and I love mine more than the college education I could have bought instead"
Drifting,3cdji0,DirtyLove937,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, if you don't mind my asking about your build how much time and money did you have to put in to get it to run and perform well enough? Or is that a never ending process?"

The list goes on and on. Then when it's finished get ready to pay $400+ for tires for each event and fix everything that breaks , because every drift car is going to break (a lot) and someday someone online will ask u how much you spent and you'll realize you should have bought a 240 like everyone else..."

Cars are more sport oriented; lower to the ground, lighter, more aerodynamic, etc.   Drifting started, developed, and continues to be an asphalt sport, so trucks aren't advantageous in any way in asphalt drifting.   If it were off road, maybe truck drifting as a sport could take off, but until then, there's really no reason to drift a truck other than the novelty."
Drifting,3cdji0,94bajakid,2,Tue Jul 7 07:15:38 2015 UTC,"I'd also add the point that suspension characteristics are not suitable for drifting, by the time you'd made it better, you'd have spent double what you would have for a car."

When someone hits (first time some actually got hurt) they always leave from the spot and regroup elsewhere for police reasons. It's street drifting. The chances of contact hitting something is high. It's driver error of course but the viewers were also not paying attention and parked on the main turns. When you go to these things you have to expect the unexpected.

Drifting,3caouc,JoeyBigDick,6,Mon Jul 6 12:45:14 2015 UTC,Be a good driver. Have money to build awesome car and trailer it everywhere. Be charismatic enough and business savvy enough to get sponsors. Easy!
Drifting,3caouc,protomor,4,Mon Jul 6 12:48:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Without lots of money or lots of charisma you will get nowhere. You need to be a really nice guy, while still going for what you want and being grateful to your sponsors. They are using you to get what they want - exposure - and you are using them to get what you want - seat time in a good car.  But to be honest, if you just bought a 240, this question is completely irrelevant. Go fucking drift, THEN decide if it's something you want to pursue seriously."

Drifting,3bxiks,thehowz200,8,Thu Jul 2 23:40:55 2015 UTC,For that cheap I would do it. 240s go for more now and so do most cars that can drift. Definitely enough power for beginning but not much more after grassroots level. Make sure to learn all about taking care of Wankel engines.
Drifting,3bxiks,BrokenNumbers,5,Fri Jul 3 00:13:41 2015 UTC,Mad Mike drove an RX8 before his current 4 rotor miata. Just sayin.
Drifting,3bxiks,dwee370,6,Fri Jul 3 05:15:08 2015 UTC,That was a 20b turbo...
Drifting,3bxiks,donotforgetthis2,2,Fri Jul 3 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"RX8 is a pretty nice car. After some work it could be a great starter car. In the dry with a welded diff and the boost tweaked you could get some fun from it.    I would hold on to your £1500 and wait.... If you plan on ONLY using this car for tracks then you can pick up a shitty 200sx, r32/33 for that or even buy a half decent BMW (I fucking hate those)    I'm about to buy myself an IS200 bolt my nice big charger on to it, weld the diff, 16's rear, 17's front (Lowered more at the front to level the car out) Not too bad just pushing 180/200ish.    Eventually i'll get a 200sx imported (Almost half the price of buying over here)"
Drifting,3bxiks,JamesTrendall,5,Fri Jul 3 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"But if this is in America, That would be an amazing deal and OP should definitely get the RX8, assuming they know the care that a rotary requires. If they are willing to spend some money and maybe lose interior parts and things to lighten the car it could be a very good drift car."
Drifting,3bxiks,dwee370,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:14:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I wouldn't hesitate to get an R32 or R33 but that isn't very easy for cheap in America unfortunately
Drifting,3bxiks,MrKnister95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"1500 bicks is a good price. But do you know anything about Rotarys? Because even if it's just a 1500 dollar RX8, rebuilding a blown engine or getting a new engine could cost you 2000+ dollars very easy."
Drifting,3bxiks,MrKnister95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:58:42 2015 UTC,"I know a decent amount on Rotarys. This one has had work, most recently new apex seals, and it is in good shape. Because of such a low torque model that the rotary produces we would probably run it for a while until it bricks and instead if rebuilding it swap to an LS1 or an SR20DET or 1JZ/2JZ, whatever we can get our hands on for a decent price. We considered turbo kits, but it's just too much money to be dumping into a 2 rotor engine"
Drifting,3bxiks,fc3s,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"In this case you and your buddy should definitely get that RX8. It sounds like you guys know what you're doing, so there isn't much that could go wrong. Especially for that price."
Drifting,3bxiks,TatakaiEX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"If you wanna have a turbo rotary, swap in one that was turbo from the factory when the stock motor dies. 13b-t (fc), 13b-re (cosmo), or 13b-rew (fd).  Then you get a respectable amount of torque and you still keep the motor behind the front axle (which may not actually be good for drifting).  But hey, you get that brap brap with tons of fireballs, so extra style points.  Realistically though, a turbo rotary is going to run hot as fuck and be somewhat finicky and require a monster cooling system so it doesn't grenade the apex seals through the housings."
Drifting,3bxiks,TatakaiEX,-1,Sat Jul 4 01:27:50 2015 UTC,"First off, yes, that's a great price.   2nd; as a ""first drift car"" no, rx8's are terrible. Heavy, narrow, and underpowered. The reason they exist in drifting is because of drivers sponsored by Mazda, which does have a contingency program for individuals who wish to take their Mazda vehicles to the racetrack. FD's are a much better drift chassis, but because Mazda sponsorship, they have to run whatever Mazda wants to promote (aka mad mike building a new Miata)  3rd; while being a great price for a bad car, first thing I'd recommend is junking the rotary for an ls1 swap. Hell, if you don't want to spend the money on that, at least get an iron block 5.3 (lm7 I think, off the top of my head. Google Chevy engines, it's basically the ls1 but iron block and less displacement and like 30 less hp/tq , comes in trucks) for $550 shipped or even a local junkyard should have one.  The only downside to this, is that to make it drift able, you're still going to be out let's say $5k. Around here (WA) the drift tax is terrible, but you can buy a shitbox s13 that would make an excellent starter drift car for the same $5k."
Drifting,3bxiks,TatakaiEX,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:35:50 2015 UTC,Heavy? I thought it was only like 3000 pounds stock with near 50/50 weight distribution?
Drifting,3bxiks,fc3s,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"Ehh, in my opinion anything over 3k is ""heavy"", and actually the 50/50 weight distribution is terrible for drifting.

I used a Kaaz 1.5way, loved it, but ended up selling it because again, didn't know any better, i got it for the NA rear end... not knowing how junk they were. the 2nd time around driving it I used a welded t2 diff. the kaaz was by far nicer, but the welded gets the job done.  it was a simple car at the time. bone stock engine from the airbox to the mufflers, Koyo radiator/oil cooler, carbon fiber hood, version select roof wing, stance coilovers (junk, never again) kaaz 1.5way, nardi steering wheel, and mb battles before everyone and their mom bought them.  yes, BN type-2 kit. unlike the s13, it has stayed somewhat together, except i lost a sideskirt driving in a really bad rainstorm. my s14 has a dmax kit, just waiting on my painter to make time for me."

Drifting,3bnuxy,protomor,3,Tue Jun 30 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"Good read, and I agree with what you're saying. I haven't had a car I can use the E-brake in real life yet but I use that technique all the time in forza etc when I'm using my wheel. I would caution that it is easy to fall into a habit of what works. Remember to keep trying for less e-brake usage. You'll maintain a higher pace through the corner and show more skill.  It should be noted the speed decrease will also depend on the suspension alignment and tire specs."
Drifting,3bnuxy,Shinny1337,2,Wed Jul 1 03:19:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. I can find this becoming a crutch as a driver progresses. It's almost more a save than a main technique. But in some instances (like atlanta) where it's a necessity.
Drifting,3bnuxy,Subiepride,2,Wed Jul 1 11:56:24 2015 UTC,Damn love learning the technical side of this
Drifting,3bnuxy,SoulBoogieHero,2,Wed Jul 1 09:54:08 2015 UTC,"The brake pedal can act very similar to the hand brake. When my ebrake was broken, I would come in really hot, clutch kick, whip, then foot brake during shut down. I noticed the arch is different than when decel cost in. But a foot brake won't save u like the hand brake, especially when skimming over clips."
Drifting,3bnuxy,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:36:04 2015 UTC,Left foot braking can extend your arc slightly depending on your brake setup and how much power you have. That was how I made the long sweepers in my stock mustang. However once you start getting into a purpose designed car it would be easy for left foot braking to simply cause the car to over rotate instead.

Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:55:32 2015 UTC,"In D1GP you would score a zero for spending this much time using handbrake.  Here in SA, if you are at the right comp, our judges penalise for ass drag entries, as they show poor car control and lack of commitment to the initial entry."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:26:32 2015 UTC,"Proof for the D1 rule?  There's ass dragging into an entry and there's slowing down because your entry was so early. Generally, FD has an OZ soon after entry so that if you ass drag too much, you won't make the full OZ."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"if your entry is too early, you fucked up. Generally FD has some of the worst judging criteria in drift."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think FD's judging might be odd. But their layouts make sense. They use an initiation zone that you have to initiate by. It makes entries, and thereby the rest of the course, that much more difficult."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"If you have to extend a drift out to a clipping point, you wash off some angle and throw in more throttle. You do not need the handbrake to extend a drift out further, and using it to do so shows lack of throttle control. I actually got marked severely down in a local comp due to that because I had nfi how the fuck to get out there, and yet most of the other guys with more experience did."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree. You shouldn't use the hand brake to reach a zone. You use the hand brake to stay in an outer zone for FD. I even mention that (in different words) in the article. The main use in FD for this is to stay in an outer zone like the entry into the keyhole at ATL.   Hand brake chopping for an entry, I find, it generally when you need to decelerate for the initial corner. Look at a bunch of in car video. Most entries are hand brake."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:49:55 2015 UTC,"You dont need to handbrake to drift multi-apex corners. The handbrake slows the car down and essentially stops drift. Using it to stay in an outer zone as you say, is very bad driving from people who are supposed to be professional. You dont need to handbrake to drift multi-apex corners, its all about throttle control and washing off a bit of angle and left foot brake to bring the nose of the car in tighter when you need to (which you can see in a lot of FD videos). You can tell when someone uses handbrake to extend their drift, because it looks like shit compared to those that dont."
Drifting,3bnuxy,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's used for every multi apex corner. It's properly used when you can't normally stretch from one apex to another (dictated by the course, not your shit driving). And yes, LFB produces a similar effect. I don't agree that it looks like shit. Otherwise, most drivers would never touch their hand brake.   I think you frown upon any use of the hand brake outside of a singlel jab?"
Drifting,3bnuxy,SoulBoogieHero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:25:58 2015 UTC,"I frown on handbrake use outside of initiation for the first corner as a quick jab, and the only other time it should be used is to maintain proximity without smacking the other guy too hard."

Drifting,3bn2nk,Desertman123,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:44:29 2015 UTC,Fwd or rwd
Drifting,3bn2nk,fortunate_sonn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"Well, to start off, drifting really isnt being out of control. It is controlling the car in a slide.   Secondly, you really cant do this in an automatic. The basic fundamental idea is countersteer. The back end of the car steps out, you turn in the same direction. This works in any vehicle and prevents you from spinning out.   But beyond that it is not really controllable at all unless it is rear wheel drive, and a manual. Obviously there are exceptions, such as an awd car with a shit ton of power and an automatic transmission that you control completely. Think of an Evo X with 400whp, and a dual clutch transmission. But that is the rare exception.   You really need a manual, rear wheel drive car, if you hope of really be in control of it while sliding. This also would apply to a manual, awd car in slippery conditions (basically making the need for a ton of hp go away)."
Drifting,3bn2nk,Griffin-dork,3,Tue Jun 30 16:09:56 2015 UTC,"To properly drift this is true, but the same physics applies to the exact situation the OP described. If your trashy fwd auto starts to oversteer, you countersteer and avoid shifting weight off the rear - maintain speed, accelerate if safe, or at most ease partially off the throttle. Braking or releasing the throttle shifts weight forward, and the rear tires lose even more traction, usually ending in loss of control. If your rwd starts to oversteer (and it wasn't because you overpowered it), similar applies. If you mashed the gas in the rain, back off the throttle, but again don't release entirely or brake. In either case, you probably came into a curve too fast, but resist the urge to quickly shed speed - slow down to a safe speed gradually and without braking if possible.  To counter-steer, you point the tires the direction you want to go, not further. If you're turned too far, when you regain traction the car is going to head straight where the tires point. One of the biggest mistakes is over-correcting, which will shift weight and can cause you to lose control again the opposite direction, possibly worse. This is a technique drifters will use to start a drift at times, turning out of the corner then quickly into it to shift weight and break the rear end loose. Point the wheel where we hope to be, keep enough throttle to not dip the front end (or as little dip as possible if you need to slow to a safe speed), and hope.  As for practicing for an emergency situation, and NOT trying to drift your car, an open wet paved area is great, ideally with permission. Water will take care of losing traction, and with a flat surface and nothing to hit, if you spin it's not a big deal. Don't do this at 80 or anything, start very slow and gradually practice faster, but still at ""slow"" speeds.  If you've got a parking cone or two, you can set clear targets, but you can use any real point of reference. Drive straight, cut the wheel hard until it slides, practice until you can point the car back the direction you were heading consistently. If you're having a hard time sliding (not wet?), brake hard as well, it will shift weight.  Your first attempts shouldn't be hard enough to rotate you more than 30-45 degrees, you're not in a drift competition going for that insane entry. They also shouldn't send you more than a car length or two, we're starting small for safety and the same skills apply when you're sideways at 90mph.  If your goal is to correct from an emergency, don't worry about trying to shift in a manual - the shift time will dip the nose just like letting off the throttle.  Tires have a given amount of traction. You can turn, or you can change speed, but pairing the two exceeds your traction way easier than one alone. Keep this in mind to avoid sliding in the first place. Accelerate or brake to your desired speed before turning, and change speed again when you're done. In a less binary form, you brake in the straight, turn, and at the apex of the turn, when you'll be starting to turn the wheels back, you start accelerating again.  Drifting techniques can apply, but in an emergency slide you almost always want to control the slide to stop it as quickly as possible pointing in a safe direction or stopped safely. Drifters spend their effort maintaining a slide in a controlled fashion, but this is not the best way to deal with your average emergency."

Drifting,3bn2nk,bakageta,3,Tue Jun 30 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"Don't just crank it hard into the oversteer though, you generally want your front tires pointed where you want to go, especially if you suddenly gain traction again."

Drifting,3bn2nk,RobLit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Bitchy reply: If you slid on a normal corner, you room it too fast (probably way too fast). If you mashed the brake while sliding because you thought now going the right speed would help, you made another driver error. The result would have been the same in either fwd or rwd, and VERY similar in awd.   If you weren't traveling too fast, but somehow turned late and ran off the road, the same applies given your actions. A skilled driver could've corrected much better or avoided the situation entirely, in any type of car."

Every pro car has an ebrake and they make liberal use of it. If you look at lots of in car video, it's about 75%+ ebrake entries. Clutch kicks tend to be most common when you're low in the power band or just have low power over all.   But long story short, every technique has its use. Do not ignore any one. Master them all."

Especially in the snow with my Subaru(it doesn't have enough power to spin all four on dry pavement). And my truck can break the rears loose on whatever, when ever. But the truck has a pedal e-brake, so in the truck I just transfer weight and mash the gas, it is comfortable and works well with how much torque I have. And with the Subaru in snow or dirt I transfer weight and rip the brake off throttle, then get on it and let it rip. The Subaru takes much more work, but four wheels snow drifts are the most fun!   Just do what feels good, and if you have enough torque to just mash the gas, that takes alot of complexity out of it."

Drifting,3bhm3i,Hoffman5982,2,Mon Jun 29 11:32:42 2015 UTC,"I have not, but I have a friend that does. Rfactor feels the same for me. I will say that during the year that I was piecing together s13 I played gran turismo with my G27 and got really good at drifting , then after year when the car was running, I went to my first every drift event and was linking the course by my third run. Before that I had barely any real practice. My friend did pretty much the same at his first event after playing live for speed a lot. So I firmly believe these games help tremendously in real life. The G-forces are the biggest thing to overcome"

Drifting,3b13u2,QuickStopRandal,2,Thu Jun 25 03:11:45 2015 UTC,To be fair this was back before sequential shifters were available. Maybe he really needed to shift that fast?
Drifting,3b13u2,ohmyword,5,Thu Jun 25 03:37:27 2015 UTC,No one goes through gears like that in any race scenario.
Drifting,3b13u2,QuickStopRandal,6,Thu Jun 25 06:13:18 2015 UTC,"imagine a 5 speed H pattern box on a top fuel drag car. Thats a scenario that is plausible, ish."
Drifting,3b13u2,mowbuss,4,Thu Jun 25 07:41:24 2015 UTC,Don't top fuel drag cars just burn the clutch the entire way and replace it often?  Because if you were shifting like this you'd only get power like 40% of the time.
Drifting,3b13u2,Koiq,3,Thu Jun 25 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"Look, lets not get into specifics. I was just saying that it is a possibility."
Drifting,3b13u2,mowbuss,8,Thu Jun 25 09:58:39 2015 UTC,"Can we stick to Rampart, here?  There's no top-level drag car that uses an H-pattern shifter.  They either run some variant of an automatic or, like Koiq said, have a multi-plate clutch that basically welds itself together over the course of the run, which makes me question exactly what the driver is even there for other than to hold on and go ""OOOOHHH SHIIIIIT!""."
Drifting,3b13u2,QuickStopRandal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:21:54 2015 UTC,I think you missed the point of what I said entirely.
Drifting,3b13u2,mowbuss,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"I dont know much about top fuel dragsters. But I would assume they use an automatic transmission or something that doesnt require the driver to shift. The people that drive those are glorified stunt dummies in my opinion. They are along for the right. They really only have two jobs. Mash that gas pedal as quickly as you can when that light goes green, and to attempt to hold that steering wheel straight. Thats about it, there are so many G's being exerted on them they cant really do much else. It takes all of your strength just to keep your foot planted and hands on the wheel."
Drifting,3b13u2,Griffin-dork,0,Thu Jun 25 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel.  I really don't see why competitive drag racing is a thing at that level.  It seems like something you should do once to beat the record, then you're done.  I'd say 9-12 second quarter miles with an H-pattern shifter are the sweet spot for driver skill, anything else is just highway driving or holding on for dear life."
Drifting,3b13u2,QuickStopRandal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, its more of a showcase of the machine than a driver for me. Im really not into drag racing at all. If you were an engine builder then I would see why you compete in drag racing. We built this drag engine that makes X horsepower and it ran a X quarter mile time. Where as in most other motorsports its a balance of a good engineering team building the car and a good driver. To be competitive you need both.   Thats why I like drifting. Its cheap, a shit ton of fun, and you dont need to have an expensive car to shine as a driver. You can show up other people with just an S13, with a KA in it, and a decent suspension setup that you built in a weekend."
Drifting,3b13u2,Griffin-dork,0,Thu Jun 25 16:35:06 2015 UTC,Not if the clutch game is as strong.  Rumor has it that Bruce Lee could shift faster than an Aventador.

Could be suspension pieces or the wheel well. If it looks like it clears everything, which is unlikely, follow the same steps as if it were rubbing in the rear."
Drifting,3b5i78,Dandrift89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:23:34 2015 UTC,My guess is you own a 240? Take a hammer to the seem weld in your wheel wells.

Drifting,3arcbh,TheSteveO,2,Tue Jun 23 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"Depends on the paint. If the paint isn't bad you can just scuff and spray, only taking the few areas down to metal. If it's got a ton of issues and bubbles then yeah invest in a good orbital and take it down to bare metal.

Drifting,3aiysz,halfhighhindu,3,Sat Jun 20 23:56:51 2015 UTC,The physics breakdown was a little tough to follow. It is important to make the distinction between kinetic friction and static friction. The difference is what can explain how cars drift. The reason you want the rear tires to spin in a drift is because the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of static friction. Having rear tires tires spin and only produce kinetic friction with the ground while the front tires roll with out slipping and produce static friction gives the car the ability to slide and rotate. The hand brake provides the rear wheels break in static friction. Lock the rear wheels to reduce grip and then give them power to keep up the kinetic friction while still moving the car.

Drifting,3ae18l,Jehovanny,3,Fri Jun 19 10:33:44 2015 UTC,"1) I would like to know how much i should be spending for a project car to beat up and begin to learn to drift.   Everything really depends on how much you want to spend. Example of a beginner drift car: E36.   Can be bought for sub $1000  strip the interior, weld the diff, get coilovers ($300). There you have a basic drift car.  Optional: Hydraulic Handbrake (From $300), Sport Seat & Steering Wheel (From $350)   2) If I were to spend 100$ a week on the car to do upgrades and maintenance what should i begin specifically to work on?   Focus on doing maintenance first hand. Change fluids and filters."

Drifting,3ae18l,mxrulez731,2,Fri Jun 19 11:56:13 2015 UTC,"1) Depends completely on you and the market you live in, might buy a running car, a rolling shell plus a motor. I can say though buy something that is easy to get upgrades for but also you wont get to angry when it gets hit.  2) Spend your money getting the car to a stage that it can car. By that i mean get it running, do the bare minimum to drift (welded diff basically) then worry about upgrades. Too many people spend way to long buying upgraded parts that they don't really need when they would be better off getting some seat time first as that seat time will tell you exactly what is needed and you will be a better driver in the process."
Drifting,3ae18l,protomor,2,Fri Jun 19 11:11:35 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on you. Cheap cars can be had for around $1k. Good starters are as much as $8k.   2) Good suspension, locking diff, bucket seats   3) Club loose has stuff both above and below you. They can be abrasive but they are a good place."

Drifting,3ae18l,ssg_driftspecz,2,Fri Jun 19 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"Buying a project car really isn't how you should start out. Start with a good running car that you don't really need to worry about breaking on you. I started with a bone stock 350z. As I began to learn, I upgraded as necessary. First I started with coilovers, then exhaust (makes it easier to hear what the car is doing) then I upgraded to a koyo radiator. As you get better you will realize what needs to be upgraded. Once you are at a point where you understand what you need to drift competitively, that's when you should buy a project car."
Drifting,3ae18l,Griffin-dork,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:08:47 2015 UTC,ive been looking at 350 and i see they kinda price around here in new york. But again i would like to start decent with a project car tha ti can just begin with just weld diff. and with coilovers to start and from tere i will progress into what i need.
Drifting,3ae18l,Griffin-dork,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:03:33 2015 UTC,"1) Up to you. But ideally, go buy a running car since you dont seem to have much experience. You can find a 240sx with the stock motor and some coilovers and welded diff (go welded, Nissan LSDs suck and are a waste of time/money) for 2000-3000. This is all you need to learn and will teach you the fundamentals.  2) Dont set a certain number. What the car needs will fluxuate. But most importantly is maintenance. Lets say you do get a S13 hatch with the stock KA, some coilovers, and a welded diff. Well go through the entire suspension and replace ANY worn out busings, ball joints, etc. Replace them with either aftermarket pieces (ISIS suspension arms are good bang for your buck) or just stock replacements. Go through the engine and make sure it is 100% up on maintenance and running good. For a KA24, get a new timing chain kit, water pump, valve cover gasket, distributor cap, plug wires, and plugs. Change the oil while youre at it and you will have a happy engine for a while. Also make sure to check the power steering system for any leaks. Drifting is hard on PS systems.   Other than that once you get the car, just drift it and enjoy it. If you want something, do it. If you find that whatever suspensions the car came one feels soft and worn out. Buy new, stiffer, better coilovers. You can link corners but need more angle? A simple steering rack spacker will do.   Ultimately just let the grow grow as you grow as a driver. Dont overbuild it, that is the WORST thing you can do.  3) Dont street drift. I repeat. DONT STREET DRIFT. That shits gay. Go to proper events and learn. Clubloose is in Western, PA and New Jersey. IFD (Ifuckindrift) is up in new york I believe. Drift Cleveland has an event in Lake County Ohio, which is pretty close to Lake Erie. Depends on your location in New York.  You see to have good intentions. Good luck. Just be smart and dont get too deep too fast. And remember, drifting should always be fun. If its no longer any fun then whats the point?"
Drifting,3ae18l,IIDutch,2,Fri Jun 19 14:49:14 2015 UTC,"Lol i read the dont street drift. This is why i came here in the first  place due to the fact i've always try to do everything right and i was just curious if any one knew a place i could go. But again ty for the information, I was thinking it was more about changing the suspension in the car was going to be the main thing but from the looks of it as a beginner im starting to see its just basically getting a car to run and run healthy is all I need to begin with and that's kinda a relief. Ill do basic engine maintenance and start with weld diff. and coilovers and then like you said make sure everything in the car is moving solidly.   Again Ty for the information."
Drifting,3ae18l,Sugar1989,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:25:44 2015 UTC,Not a problem. Starting out its really important to KISS (Keep it simple stupid). Simple means more reliable (usually) and reliability = more seat time at events.   Find some local events within a couple hours of you once you get a car and just go. Drive the car there and drive home (having AAA is a good idea just in case). With a KA S13 you can drift on 2 pairs of tires all day long. A hatchback S13 can fit 4 wheels + tires and a small toolbox and jack pretty easily so you and a passenger can just ride in it there and back. Thats what Ive always done with mine.
Drifting,3ae18l,Sugar1989,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:26:38 2015 UTC,i really want to find events so im trying to find thigs that are close also i would like to add that i will post my progression here and like to inform everyone what i get so i can get help from all of you and hopefully oneday make this subreddit proud :D
Drifting,3ae18l,robomuppet,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:21:22 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a very budget build of a 1990 Miata so I'll go through basic stuff I've done. Where I live (prairies of Canada) all vehicles have to pass a safety inspection to be registered and road legal, however you can buy day permits to drive vehicles around and move them with the idea your using that to get it worked on to be safetied.  Keeping that in mind I purchased a non registerable 1.6l miata for extremely cheap. It had a bunch of hail damage so I had to buy a new windshield and cut out the old one. Only cost me $116 and I did the labor myself.  After that I completely gutted the car of everything it doesn't need to drift. Carpet, side glass, convertible top, stock seats, seat belts, HVAC and extra wiring, and more. Installed a lightweight bride bucket seat I already owned and a four point harness, and a few switches to control radiator fans and my headlights (went with a small led strip and removed the bulky headlights and motors that go with pop up lights) since its a track car only.  Performance wise all I've done is a lightweight straight pipe right off the headers (later welded in a magnaflow muffler as I didn't want to be a dink to my neighbors with a fully straight through exhaust)  Installed a stage 3 6 puck clutch, to handle all the abuse the car gets thrashing around the track, with a lightweight chromoly flywheel. Removed the differential and welded up the gear solid in the open 1.6l diff. Put in used lowering springs but it didn't help much with body roll since my bushings are all shot. I will be welding the struts solid compressed to eliminate body roll till I can afford coilovers. Oh and really good grip in the front is important to eliminate understeer or snap oversteer. That sounds dumb ""oh its a drift car why do you want grip anywhere"" but its true, I put Nitto NT01's on the front of my miata and have never had an issue with understeer and it helps immensely with flicking the rear out to initiate a drift, as the full weight transfer is used during a scandi flick.  Every car will be a little bit different but a lot of the principals are the same. And for drifting lots of it can be done yourself if you have a bit of experience (mechanical, and welding wise) Basics are...  weld the rear differential, eliminate body roll (either lowering springs, coilovers or go super haggard and  weld the struts solid), lose weight and gut the car, and PRACTICE  lots  Don't be afraid to wreck anything either or it will get in your head and prevent you from learning, but at the same time don't try stuff your not comfortable with. At the track I go to, its just an oval track, but the far bend leads into a wall so I never even attempted that corner until last event when I was confident enough to know I wouldn't go spinning into the wall."

Drifting,3a9vue,campbellsouup,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:38:13 2015 UTC,Yep always cut and snap going with banked turns
Drifting,3a9vue,Shinny1337,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:46:16 2015 UTC,Definitely a step in the right direction. Using only the ebrake slows you down. Throwing the weight around allows you to maintain speed or even to continue to accelerate into the drift. Then you can use the ebrake to bleed off speed and keep the arc of your drift from going off course or into the wall.   Fujiwara good would be initiating at the theoretical speed limit that allows you to maintain the line only modulating the throttle. So keep trying to improve on it. Remember there's a reason excessive ebrake use in FD is a deduction.
Drifting,3a9vue,mowbuss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"try it without the e-brake, but a more aggressive skando with more speed. An aggressive skando will cut your speed and give you more angle whilst you use power to get out the the edge of the track"

Drifting,39hs4g,minnion,0,Fri Jun 12 01:41:58 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with showing of. But just making a small drift video and getting into filming and editing.
Drifting,39ekcf,Pork_Fried_Bryce,4,Thu Jun 11 05:15:44 2015 UTC,"Ah CL. What's the overall criteria to move from C to B? That would guide most answers. You're constantly on the rev limiter and shallow. This means your gearing is wrong. Or you can simply upshift since you have the power. When you're trying to stretch for that next corner, the hand brake will help you. But that's slow.  Your entry is over zealous. That flick you did into the corner worked too well. It looks like your tires were already bald but you didn't know or notice that going into the corner. You adjust soon after. Basically, your entry will be more experience than anything I can tell you. Miatas pivot fast."
Drifting,39ekcf,protomor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:48:21 2015 UTC,His gearing is fine. The gear he is choosing is possibly wrong but only because he's under speed. The best way to find the right speed is to grip drive the track as fast as you can drifting the last corner then when start drifting the corner before and then the one before it until you are sliding the whole course. This will teach you the speeds you need.
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,2,Thu Jun 11 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd be in 3rd for a majority of this circuit."
Drifting,39ekcf,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,0,Thu Jun 11 17:03:15 2015 UTC,IMO Noobs need to start slow and gain speed. I'll admit gearing could be fine. It's hard to tell from video.   His wheel speed is maxed out at the limiter. So only a hand brake will give him more angle. But then he's even slower for the corner.
Drifting,39ekcf,protomor,0,Thu Jun 11 16:48:48 2015 UTC,Handbrake isn't only for gaining angle its for extending outward or slowing without losing angle.
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:43:19 2015 UTC,Hold that bitch up and you'll gain angle. That's how you do J turns and hand brake initiations. Short bursts won't gain you angle.
Drifting,39ekcf,protomor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:54:35 2015 UTC,yep and you'll loose all your speed doing it.
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:02:21 2015 UTC,Which is my point. Probably simplest solution for this guy is to up shift.
Drifting,39ekcf,protomor,2,Thu Jun 11 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"right I didn't disagree there, only your gearing comment, I'm sure the car is geared fine :P"
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,2,Thu Jun 11 18:15:47 2015 UTC,Needs more throttle control. You're sawing at the wheel the whole time with your foot mashed down. You want to have smooth consistent motions on the wheel while your foot works the pedal like a child sewing god damn Nikes together. If going up a gear seems to be too low in the rpms try left foot braking mid drift. I had to do this in my mustang when the corner was too long for 3rd gear.
Drifting,39ekcf,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:15:40 2015 UTC,The idea being that LFB will make the front end tuck more mid-corner?
Drifting,39ekcf,MiataTrySlide92,2,Thu Jun 11 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you won't stomp the brakes but lowering the front wheel speed while maintaining the rear with throttle can extend the arc while holding angle."
Drifting,39ekcf,Shinny1337,3,Thu Jun 11 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Your speed is low. Get used to driving at a speed into the corners where simply lifting off the throttle and turning in will allow the car to rotate. Utilize the ebrake, If you feel like your ebrake is weak it's because of my first point, it will feel a lot easier to lock of the rear tires when they are already near or past the limit of their lateral grip. Lastly, there are times I see your helmet turn towards the direction the the vehicle is sliding. Say your approaching a right turn you should be looking at the clipping point and using your peripheral vision to gauge how close to the edge of the track you are. You need to be constantly looking where you want the car to go because subconsciously it will always go where you are looking so if you're headed off track look for that clipping point and stand on the throttle. I disagree with the throttle control remark, pedal to the floor whenever you can you don't wanna be pussyfotting around. You can let go of the steering wheel more and allow the car to rotate on its own the wheel will always want to correct it self for you, with a short wheelbase like that you probably have to give it a throw to stay ahead of the car but you're also slowing it down wheeling it the whole way around. You don't need to force it until you get to the point where you want to add aggressiveness to your transitions.   I've been drifting since 1999 and consistently placed top 16 in XDC and FD pro am events."
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:36:00 2015 UTC,Also ask someone who's driving you respect to drive your car and ride along with them then drive and let them ride. The best advice can be gotten that route. I would be amazed if anyone turns you down.
Drifting,39ekcf,driftaholic,2,Thu Jun 11 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about needing an e-brake, it helps but it's not necessary.  From what I can see all you need to work on is throttle control and not being so aggressive with the steering wheel, better throttle control will mean you can just let the wheel do it's thing a bit more, don't man handle it, just be a bit more smooth and don't mash the throttle as much, drifting is just as much steering input as it is throttle input.  That vid looked sick though!"

Seems like you already have a pretty decent idea of how youd like your car to be sliding through the turns and can use more work on getting it to stick to a better line.  Also looks like you could use moar angle.
Drifting,39ekcf,mmmmmyee,0,Thu Jun 11 07:22:48 2015 UTC,He has a bad line because he's on the rev limiter and it sucks him to the inside of every corner. He's also shallow because he's on the limiter.
Drifting,39ekcf,protomor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:21:24 2015 UTC,He's on the limiter because he's too slow. There is nothing wrong with being on the limiter though. He's also shallow because his speed is too low to carry him around the right line.

Drifting,39ekcf,Wemlizz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"My basic advice as an internet warrior is to work less at steering. Practice choku dori manjis (transitioning back and forth down a straight), initiating the rear end swap by lifting off and just letting the wheel glide through your fingers."
Drifting,39ekcf,MiataTrySlide92,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"Better throttle control. Don't be afraid to use the throttle to drive the car. I know it  sounds weird, but drive the car with the throttle. Smoother steering inputs.  It appears to be a vacuum gauge, so in that case over inflate your tires to 60 psi for easier drifting. It's a wide track compared to some the local tracks out here so use that to your advantage."

Drifting,39ekcf,sifadula,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:25:36 2015 UTC,You're being too handsy with the wheel. Let the wheel slide through your hands more. The car is going to countersteer itself faster than what you can. Let it do the countersteer and catch it where you need to and modulate it.   I'm trying to find a video to show what I mean. Edit: Here is one I found on youtube.
Drifting,39ekcf,whyteboi,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:03:49 2015 UTC,Good on you for asking for advice.  1st: Advance your eye balls. Keep a flowing eye sight and your car will follow.  2nd: Less touching on the wheel. Watch an in car view of the pros and see how little they touch the wheel.  It's amazing what your noodle can with the car.

It's not showroom as there are some gaps which if you had more patience I'm sure you could massage out.  I was going to go with the Origin aggressive but he talked me out of it and for good reason. These kits get banged up, scraped and plenty of roadkill here in MN. It's not as cringing when you destroy a bumper that's only $200 bucks rather than one you paid $400 for.

Drifting,390cul,oneviasx,2,Mon Jun 8 09:21:01 2015 UTC,For one put a fucking helmet on. I can't believe an event's insurance would allow multicar runs with no head gear.   As to your question if the car has less power slow down some to give them more space in transition. You can make up the gap quickly with your extra power. When you spin lock up the tires and come to a stop asap. Follow cars are supposed to be able to avoid the lead car so that's up to them.
Drifting,390cul,Shinny1337,2,Mon Jun 8 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"I was waiting for someone to comment about the helmet thing hahah. But c'mon give me a break.. What actually happened was I was refusing to tandem all day and one run I took off and got followed, that's all, and it wasn't a multi car run. Our session days are really laid back, no need for helmets unless you're tandeming. Anyways, upvote for the advice, thanks!"

Drifting,390cul,ShadynastyS14,-1,Thu Jun 11 23:08:37 2015 UTC,Helmets should be a given whether you are tandeming or not.
Drifting,390cul,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:03:29 2015 UTC,That's just how our community is I guess ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Drifting,390cul,eLetoR,2,Fri Jun 12 08:30:02 2015 UTC,"Like what was said before sick throttle control. The only advice I can offer as a follow car is your first few runs go easy and watch what the other car does. Don't try to smash doors or that's what will end up happening, keep a good distance and push yourself each time. Inch closer and closer as you get more comfortable and are able to see what they're doing and allow time to adjust. I see you have your throttle control pretty good, initiation is the key when following. Initiate as you would but try to match their angle, you should know you and your cars limits by now. Just don't be afraid and build your confidence slowly as a follow car I've seen multiple ""new"" follow cars end up smashing the lead car because of easily avoidable mistakes.   Edit: Wear a helmet please!  Edit 2: The other thing is PAY ATTENTION!!! Can't stress that enough in this sport it takes focus,balls, and concentration when on the track with any motorsport."
Drifting,390cul,eLetoR,2,Wed Jun 10 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"The hardest thing I've found about following is not getting caught up in what the other drive is doing.  You need to run your own race (drift in this case).    When I was starting to tandem I would get caught up in what the other driver was doing and would initiate too early or too late.    Start with leaving some distance and then slowly start working closer and closer as you get better.  When I start closing the gap on other drivers now I know I can still do what I have to in order to avoid them if they spin because I'm not driving at my limits.  Don't just dive in immediately on a new driver or when your first learning because that's how accidents happen.  Also having a buddy that doesn't mind love taps helps a lot when working on proximity.  Also.  Force tandems are a lot of fun and its how I got started tandeming, and how I've made some of my friends that are new to drifting start.  Nothing forces you to not suck fast like a driver coming up behind you."
Drifting,390cul,eLetoR,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"I really dig the advice about running you're own race, I found myself straightening out on my first run being followed but on the second run my passenger told me, ""dude just run it how you've been running it all day"" and viola. Based off the response I received from you and u/towboat2013 it seems the only way to learn it is to simply do it. Btw are you from that shadynasty crew in oregon?"

The plans are to address all the inherent weaknesses first (cooling, crossmember mounts, etc) then replace all bushings with aluminum of dextrin (not sure on spelling of that one) sway bars, coilovers, short shifter, intake/exhaust/tune, rack spacers, and then go from there."
Drifting,38pbus,DeftHex,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:27:37 2015 UTC,Delrin ;)  Good plan to make it reliable first.  I would start basic with good suspension and a good diff and work from there later.  Also I would probably skip the short throw and just get new bushings for the shifter since short throws destroy gearboxes.

I think that miata's best style is the no style, the fact I can pick one up for a grand, throw another grand in it and i have a reliable, fun, and most importantly learners race car (not just drift) and that helps you learn how to grip when you want to and drift when you dont want to"
Drifting,387ves,Skrimgo,2,Thu Jun 4 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"I need to get the local guy who has a NB flying Miata turbo to let me drive it again. I did feel the steering ratio was fast for drifting but maybe that was the dimensions. Wonder how difficult it would be to make an unquick ratio steering rack. There's also the 8-bit Miata that's been showing you just need a diff to drift.  I've raced lots of Miata's, only drifted the one, but I think they can hold a slide to get you started. If anything I could see learning to drift with a light, underpowered, and twitchy car making you a better driver. You have to learn how to judge entry speeds. Your reflexes will be sharpened by the twitching. And finding the right angle and line is would be key to drifting smooth. Haha maybe everyone needs to make their missile cars stock NA's."
Drifting,387ves,Skrimgo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:33:28 2015 UTC,Not sure I agree about the steering ratio. Most of the turning is done with the feet so I never cared much for steering ratios.   The rest I agree with. I just don't recommend them for people who want it easy. These chassis are not easy. But the payoff if you can is huge.
Drifting,3849nt,BakedJuice,7,Mon Jun 1 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"As much as they like to compare drift cars to stock cars, I've always wondered how easy it'd be to turn one into a drift comp car. Lots of suspension re-work, added steering angle, handbrake, street tires, viola?"
Drifting,3849nt,lolramen,3,Mon Jun 1 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"There's two of these guys that run in the midwest! Havent done comp yet, but a few small events. They've got MAD angle, they're just still sorting out engine work. Something happened yesterday (I'm not sure what) that made the wheels lock up and put it into a wall. Killed over 30 minutes of time trying to get it off the track, which was a bummer. But I really dig what these guys are trying to do! they'll straight up tell you it's a work in progress, but if they survive this year, I'm excited to see what they'll do next season!"
Drifting,3849nt,Waffeey,3,Mon Jun 1 20:37:02 2015 UTC,"Lots of steering work I'd imagine, stock cars turn to the left with the wheel pointed straight on almost all oval tracks."
Drifting,3849nt,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Mon Jun 1 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"Because they run tires with built-in camber, or at least NASCAR does; I don't know about the lower series,but I imagine that it's similar."
Drifting,3849nt,chriskalb13,5,Mon Jun 1 22:49:12 2015 UTC,The tires don't have built in camber. They actually run a bigger tire on the right side. This is called stagger.
Drifting,3849nt,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,6,Tue Jun 2 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, my bad. I knew it was something like that."

Drifting,37xde3,Lupich,2,Mon Jun 1 22:02:18 2015 UTC,I assume the high upvotes are because this video contains some good drifting. The votes aren't supposed to be if you agree or not. Something can be widely upvoted and controversial in the comments.  Besides that my view on street racing is that its never a good idea. These guys aren't out on some back road they drove 2 hours into no where to get to to practice. They're out in the suburbs and in traffic. It just takes one slip up and it will happen eventually. The difference is will it be just your car in a ditch or your car through a traffic pole that smashes two car's hoods.

Drifting,37iwbn,GreatGabriel,9,Wed May 27 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're limiting yourself; telling yourself that you'll never have the money to afford nice tires is a major confidence flaw. Drifting is as expensive as you want it to be. Maybe you could trade 18s for 17s that allow you to run more affordable tires is one solution. Another one would be to turn down your boost so you don't break your drivetrain at every event. Getting your car trailered to an event is nice because it gives you some assurance that you can drive as hard as you want and still make it home, but it is expensive: get AAA, I have it (though I haven't driven an event in my own car in years) they tow up to 100 miles (regardless of the cause). To be frank, it seems to me that you've failed to realize the other possibilities that are available.   Usually the 'guys who ran FD' will tell you the same thing, ""it's all about the money"". While their pessimism carries value because they've been in it, but I would suggest you to consider the opinion of someone who is still running FD.   In conclusion, keep your car (selling a perfectly good drift car is like breaking up with a girlfriend you still love: it will hurt you a lot), figure out what you need to make drifting affordable again, and come back and post here about your tales from pro-am."
Drifting,37iwbn,TheSteveO,1 point,Thu May 28 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"Might I ask what your experience with drifting is?   Edit: I might be pessimistic to your POV, but the more important question is what OP wants to pursue. You've suggested ways to make drifting cheaper, but getting to the big show is majorly about the money, you just can't deny it. It's a full on lifestyle change as. Far as commitment goes. Although I love drifting most out of everything I've ever done, I still love other hobbies too.   If you want to get to FD, don't consider doing anything else with your life for a few years. Or have rich family."
Drifting,37iwbn,no1likesthetunahere,2,Thu May 28 08:02:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, making it to FD does include a whole lifestyle change (hell even pro-am dudes have to give up a lot in order to make it to each round), but I still stand my ground about the money.   Let's set-up a scenario: the goal is to run a whole season of pro-am without spending a single dime of your own money. You have the car built, you have the truck and trailer and all of the little bits to support your team through the whole season. The only missing pieces are tires, fuel (both for your car and truck), competition fees, hotels, and food. I would estimate that for one event you will spend $1,000 on tires (@$100/tire, with no sponsorship, gives you 5 sets, 2 for practice, 1 for qualifying, 1 for comp, 1 spare set) $250 registration, $250 on fuel for both truck and car (assuming it's a regional pro-am and you're not quite on big boy fuel yet), then $250 for food and a hotel over the course of the weekend. So $1,750 per pro-am event? Multiply that by 4 and you get +/- $7,000 for a full pro-am season. While that sounds like an exorbitantly expensive hobby, but compared to other motorsports, it's not. Even better, drifting is a hot sport right now and there are still people willing to give their money away to use your car as a billboard. But that panel space isn't all that their paying for. By agreeing to a sponsorship you have officially become their outside sales representative. If you just signed a new sponsor, you better sell their product like no end, become the Mary Kay rep of the drifting world. But signing sponsorship isn't as easy as many think either. It never begins with a half-ass email with a couple of attached pictures to some random company that you have no connections with. Generally those requests will be ignored or if they aren't, you'll get a envelope with a few stickers and 5% discount on your next order. The key to gain sponsorship is replace sponsor with partner and build relationships with the companies you work with during the course of your career.  I feel like I'm rambling, so I'll conclude with this. Succeeding in racing isn't always about who wins and who loses; the major similarity of successful teams is by building the best relationships, not who has the most money (but it does help like a socket wrench to an impact gun, having one over the other just changes the amount of time it takes to get the job done). If you want to make it to FD, you gonna sure as hell gonna need to build a lot of relationships, so start now and don't limit yourself by your bank account.   As far as my own experience, I've been in the industry for the last five years working at a couple of racetracks here in Orlando. I now announce at Pro-Am events on the east coast. Both gave me great opportunities to see drivers succeed and fail. I've seen a handful of drivers make it to FD, and some sell their pro-am chassis in order to make rent and feed their families. By observing this over the course of a few years, I believe you get a good sense of what the right and wrong way to go about things. I've had formal education in marketing and business, as well as classes in race track management and classes in gaining and maintaining sponsorships in racing."
Drifting,37iwbn,TheSteveO,1 point,Thu May 28 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"thanks your quite the motivational speaker hahah i had AAA before but most of the tracks are over 100miles out and id like to hit up some tracks that are out of state in the future. Having my truck with all my tools , spare parts and room for tires is quite nice instead of driving a racecar fully packed with no a/c or heater lol . if i keep the racecar i need to keep the truck."
Drifting,37iwbn,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu May 28 15:39:36 2015 UTC,Yeah sounds like you need to worry about getting your car to happy reliable medium. Being at the pointy end of motor sports takes huge financial backing. I agree you need to focus on making the car work for the entire year because really an extra 100hp isn't going to translate to much speed mid-drift unless you've really got the suspension and tires dialed in. I agree with getting rid of your trailer/tow vehicle and just getting AAA. I've driven my race cars to and from events across multiple states for 7 years and only recently had to have a tow.   I think you want to compete but you haven't yet realized the only person you're competing against is yourself. You can't do anything to make your opponent better or worse you can only improve yourself. There will always be someone with more talent or money if not both. Just focus on improving your driving. Trust me when you start beating people in your car that 'isn't up to par' it'll make the accomplishments all the better.   Just remember motorsports should be about honing your skills. Its much cheaper to buy trophies from the trophy store.
Drifting,37iwbn,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu May 28 03:08:53 2015 UTC,It's not that I'm pushing a bunch of HP but I'm on stock twins (which are known for blowing up) and I I have a W58 trans which is my 3rd one . I have to spend like 3k for a proper trans and another 2k for a proper turbo set up. If I sell my truck I won't be able to bring enough tires . I'll go threw just a pair in a few laps . Also without a ride home I wouldn't be able to push it as hard especially with tandeming
Drifting,37iwbn,driftsc,1 point,Thu May 28 04:04:06 2015 UTC,That seems odd. One of our guys pushing into Pro-am runs around 400whp in his S13 and I don't believe he dropped a ton of money on the trans. Checking with him to see if he uses the W58. Make friends with someone whose going that has room for some more tires and rims in their truck. I'd bet you could find someone whose going to spectate that wouldn't mind hauling tires for a beer and a few ride alongs.  He said he's running the R154 in his. But his girlfriends car is running his old W58 with a stock 2JGTE. I know he went to a single turbo on his car for reliability though. I have to say I'm surprised the 2J's seem to have such weak trans with very few options considering how bulletproof the motors are supposed to be.
Drifting,37iwbn,driftsc,1 point,Thu May 28 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"w58 trans came in the non turbo it wasnt ment to handle power. r154 is the trans to get but its 2k for the trans w/bellhousing and another 1k for clutch , slave , line ect"

Drifting,37iwbn,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Thu May 28 06:10:35 2015 UTC,"Not to be negative, but the first time you blew up that W58 you probably should have realized those transmissions were garbage and were never meant to take any kind of abuse.  If you cant afford a nicely put together r154 or getrag setup for it, look into a 350z 6 speed.  You can get a brand new cd009 for $1600, collins makes a nice adapter and flywheel setup, and you can run any 350z clutch you want.  As a side note I would recommend the south bend stage 2 drag, just because we finished installing one into my buddy's 1jz vvti s14 a couple weeks ago and it is a super nice pedal pressure for how much torque its rated at.  Also south bend's costumer service was great, along with collins.  Unfortunately the money you have spent on multi w58's could have paid for or at least partially paid for something that can take abuse.  Also are you running take off tires or good pairs of new tires?  A couple laps for a pair of tires with a stock 2jz seems a little fast.  Also if you let your tires cool down in between runs instead of hot lapping they will last significantly longer.  I know even my stock KA s14 will go through a fresh set of dz102's pretty quickly if I hot lap, but if i let them cool down a little they will last me easily all day."

Drifting,37iwbn,TatakaiEX,1 point,Thu May 28 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"Going to a front sway bar and a small rear bar (or no rear) will make the car transition better and have better rear traction.  Adding a little rear toe in will pick up some more grip to.    The one thing that pushed me to always buying the same brand new tires is that it makes my car super consistent.  I know that every time I go out there the car will drive just like it always does.  It allows me to focus on practicing my technique, and takes out the variable of an ever changing vehicle."

Drifting,37cjfq,awyissmfbreadcrumb,8,Tue May 26 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"You're thinking too hard. Open diffs gain traction (edit: lose drift not gain traction...). Multiple clutch kicks will help keep it out but no matter what, it isn't sustainable. Plus, you're likely not healthy on power so you have to kick harder to keep it out.  Get a locking diff. Throttle playing will come later."
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,3,Tue May 26 17:09:44 2015 UTC,i only have about 110hp. is proper drifting still achievable if i only get an LSD?.more hp seems a little expensive but i think i can get an LSD later on.
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,7,Tue May 26 17:43:05 2015 UTC,Power is a nice to have. Some sort of a locking diff is base minimum. I almost wouldn't even bother trying to drift if it has an open diff. Weld it or get a good LSD (not torsen).   Power can come later.
Drifting,37cjfq,Nigel_Vertigo,6,Tue May 26 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"Open diff ""drifting"" is dangerous. You can't hold it and will get snapped back the opposite direction. Plenty of people have lost their cars that way, slamming into walls or curbs... or trees.  OP, keep your drifting to wide open areas until you weld your diff."
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,5,Tue May 26 18:22:13 2015 UTC,I wouldn't go that far. It's just not good to learn with.
Drifting,37cjfq,Staub007,2,Tue May 26 18:26:52 2015 UTC,I've never tried drifting but the concept behind it makes sense that drifting with an open diff is a bad idea.  The diff gives the torque to the wheel with the least resistance which usually ends up being the inside wheel.  That creates a moment that makes the car want to turn away from the direction of the corner.
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,2,Tue May 26 18:33:58 2015 UTC,haha im just learning. i wouldn't even try on an actual curve. its actually snapped on me several times.
Drifting,37cjfq,Pyr0monk3y,1 point,Tue May 26 18:43:52 2015 UTC,whats wrong with torsen.
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,-1,Tue May 26 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"LSDs are designed to allow slip. Torsens are designed to regain traction once you lose it. Meaning, you're fighting the diff to make it slide."
Drifting,37cjfq,abl0ck0fch33s3,3,Tue May 26 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"All LSD's are designed to help you regain traction.  It doesn't matter if it's a clutch type or helical, they all were designed to prevent you from getting stuck in the snow.    Torsens are wonderful for drifting, as good as a clutch type.  Welded diffs scare me.  You're directly disabling the one of the devices that makes the car handle predictably."
Drifting,37cjfq,bakageta,2,Tue May 26 19:19:23 2015 UTC,Torsens don't lock consistently. I've driven all types. I'd much prefer a welded diff to a torsen
Drifting,37cjfq,protomor,2,Tue May 26 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to agree with protomor on this. Torsen doesn't have the instant grip needed to get a good feel especially at low speed low hp.  They slowly gain grip as you lay into the throttle which makes it harder to drive. Clutch lads and welded diffs always lock every time, which means you're not pegging the gas to get loos then trying to recover and hold. It's one, instant, linear loss of traction which is exactly what you want.  Also diffs aren't meant to make the car handle more predictable necessarily. It's to avoid wear on the drive train axles and tires due to differences in rotational speeds when cornering"
Drifting,37cjfq,titsonalog,1 point,Wed May 27 05:33:26 2015 UTC,"Welded diffs scare me.  You're directly disabling the one of the devices that makes the car handle predictably.   Welded diffs still handle predictably, just not how you want a car to handle when not drifting. You can pretty much count on losing traction when cornering, especially if the surface is remotely wet or has a loose surface. I wouldn't run one on anything other than a track-only car, there's no reason to be sliding around in public."

Drifting,37cjfq,halycon8,2,Tue May 26 18:12:06 2015 UTC,LSD is really the only absolute need for drifting. I prefer a clutch type myself. Welding the diff will be your least expensive option though.
Drifting,37cjfq,Shinny1337,1 point,Tue May 26 18:16:37 2015 UTC,Yea i used to kill it in my 86 with 100hp Lots of clutch kicks at full throttle but its doable. Lsd is needed of course
Drifting,37cjfq,driftsc,2,Tue May 26 17:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, you need a locking diff to hold a drift.  Once you get one of those - throttle play is definitely important but especially in low power cars you'll still need to be clutch kicking mid-drift occasionally so you don't bog down."
Drifting,37cjfq,ProJoe,1 point,Tue May 26 18:21:03 2015 UTC,Also want to say that instead of relying on clutch kicks when you've got a locking diff you should focus on your line choice. Its perfectly possible to drift a low hp car without clutch kicks if you find the right speed and line for the corner. Learning that will make you a much better driver in the long run.  Edit* Here's the video I was thinking of.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdbRPEx67zo  Watch at least the first 2. You'll notice the top score is achieved with only a couple clutch kicks. His main advantage  is how he uses the weight of the car with minimal steering corrections.

Drifting,37acvv,dgerny,5,Tue May 26 03:55:13 2015 UTC,"e36. 350s are getting to be the popular choice lately. the e36 is still a decent car. you can turbo, or you can v8 with an LS, or an m/s/60/62 from the 5series. and we have badass angle options with SLR, and we can rebuild our clutch type diffs for 60% lock on the fairly cheap.   edit: and all of the rad STOCK wheel choices. style 5s, style 19s, style 32, m-parralels, countours, ds1's, ds2's, roadstars.... the list is kinda long, and cheap."

Drifting,37acvv,titsonalog,1 point,Tue May 26 06:17:11 2015 UTC,I never liked the steering feel in the Z. I hate E36s (Tearing subframes mainly).   Just do a pro con list. You can V8 both cars. You can turbo both cars. The Z will likely last longer since it's a newer chassis. But the E36 is much more plentiful for parts.
Drifting,37acvv,protomor,1 point,Tue May 26 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"E36. I'm about to do the exact same thing you're thinking of. BC Coils, SLR Angle Kit, turbo until the stock engine blows up, then swap in a BMW V8 or try and source a 1JZ or something dumb.   And, like /u/RandomHero27 said, all of the dope OEM wheel options."
Drifting,37acvv,Codidly5,1 point,Tue May 26 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"e36 FTW. My current drift car is a 96 e36, my previous was an 04 350z. While its nice to have that extra HP and torque, I'm having so much more fun with the e36. depending what your budget is, run a turbo on your e36. Its by far the cheapest option to put out great performance. My suggestion for cheap ways to get your e36 drifting even better with the stock power is to pull a 3.91 diff from an auto e36. welded obv. it compliments the stock motor well for drift, as it gives you a lot more acceleration. I have a pretty simple setup and I love it. Single mass lightweight flywheel, 3.91 welded diff, suspension. When I'm looking to be more competitive, I'll throw a turbo in. BTW m50 and m52 are the best for turbo (with metal head gaskets). the M3 s50 and s52 have thinner walls in the block to make room for the larger pistons and actually make it harder to put out a lot of boost without blowing shit up. Hope that helps!"
Drifting,37acvv,douche-pocalypes,1 point,Fri May 29 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"also, if you have an OBD1 e36, throw out that garbage getrag trans and replace with the ZF trans that came with the OBD2 models. getrag will break, ZF is more or less bulletproof."

You can get kits for ls1s and 2jz and stuff, but the beauty of the 240 is being able to import a front chop of a silvia and direct swap everything in easily.  I'm not sure any other cars have that right now"

Drifting,377dbh,SenorTylerDurden,12,Tue May 26 04:41:23 2015 UTC,I see SC300/400 starting to pop up a lot more frequently. Especially since Fueled RAcing started making a mount kit for them to fit the LSx
Drifting,377dbh,opelok,4,Mon May 25 14:51:50 2015 UTC,I owned a sc300 and i dont think it'll become a common drift car just because of how heavy it is. it felt like a boat. the nice thing about 240's are that you dont have to do much to them to start drifting. i feel like sc300/400 would just need a lot dumped into them to just get them started
Drifting,377dbh,Story_Worm,5,Mon May 25 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I recently moved to the sc and I love it, doesn't feel heavy at all, it's super stable in drift and I can manipulate just as easy as any s13 and s14 I've ever had."

Drifting,377dbh,Nigel_Vertigo,1 point,Wed May 27 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Overall, a w58 swapbis wayyy cheaper. $150 for a w58, 350 for a bell housing and 200 for a good cheap clutch. People think r154s are gold and want double that for a 7m w/o bell housing. Couple that with an expensive clutch and a trans that will need shift forks and a thrust washer... Its expensive.

But 5.0's are exactly what I said, cheap, kinda reliable (I actually didn't know that the 5.0 blocks split at anything over 500, though I do know if you're making 500hp on an SR you're already pushing the limits of the block, so sounds like a wash to me), and plentiful.   In my opinion, the key to win drifting is to simply take the good american V8 engine out of the shitty american chassis to swap in a much more capable import chassis."
Drifting,377dbh,TheSteveO,2,Tue May 26 03:59:31 2015 UTC,This is true but even pro am events have guys pushing 500-800 hp. I do believe more people need to follow Odi's example and tune their driving and chassis. But I used a stock 5.0 in my stock Mustang convertible and it was a blast. It just seems like even in the drag community you only do the 5.0 if it's more a show car. Anything for the track gets a 331 or up. Just what I've seen like I said I loved my 5.0

And you need the power, because when you're going up against opponents with 800-900-1000 hp, on a high speed track, you need to go at them with everything you can, in order to have a chance at winning."
Drifting,3739rv,mowbuss,1 point,Mon May 25 10:15:45 2015 UTC,Actually the problem here is high speed tracks and comps that penalise big lock entries and good (touching) proximity. If you cant comprehend someone throwing a backy into the first turn then you shouldnt be drifting competetively.

Include scenery, not always just cars driving around, for example, a car is about to drift around a corner. Film the corner (empty), for a few seconds, then edit in the car drifting around the corner (not at the start, maybe halfway through the drift), then edit the empty corner back in, and finish the drift off with a final cut. Kindof like an off, on, off, on shot.  Don't put in filters/effects that cover the entire video, (although this is personal preference), I prefer seeing normal footage.  I liked the 3D effect but it lasted too long. Maybe cut in a 3D effect for a second or two and then let it go normally.  Just some things i'd like to see! Good luck on your future production."

If I am watching sports videos I really want slow mo limited in its use to key moments, as over use tends to spoil the broth. Also the speed and sound of a drift car is critical, speeding up will make it look fake, and slowing down makes it look strange, only mess with the speed very occasionally.  Chose a song that doesnt over power the car sounds. One thing I have found with watching drift on TV vs at the track is that the noise of the cars is critical to my viewing enjoyment.

It was a stock base automatic and it was so peppy and well balanced I thought it could really be competition for the Miata. Its a shame they won't have replacement support but you'd probably swap most things out anyways.   Have you thought about the Z4/M coupe?

Drifting,36qzkj,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu May 21 23:34:08 2015 UTC,That really depends on the car and driver. Suspension bits run $1-2k for ok stuff. the rest varies greatly.

Drifting,36qzkj,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"Well for instance, if you wanted to take this car out, you just need to figure out how to turn off traction control. But from there you'd want a better suspension, better diff, and likely a racing seat. At that point you're good for a while. Maybe do a hydro hand brake and up power. But all of that becomes more necessary once you have the basics down."
Drifting,36qzkj,longinuszero,1 point,Thu May 21 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Sure. I guess I am trying to figure out what a minimal viable drift build is for each platform.

Drifting,36qzkj,vicnitro7979,1 point,Thu May 21 23:57:49 2015 UTC,Minimum for any drift build is a good locking/welded diff. The rest you can learn to deal with. Stay away from torsen diffs though. Getting good at drifting a car as stock as possible will make you a better driver faster. Then you'll learn what the car needs as you start to reach its limits.

Drifting,36p7z5,creamypies2,1 point,Thu May 21 02:06:25 2015 UTC,You mean Hallett? The track in the picture is a kart track in OKC. So it'll be super convenient for the guys who live there but twice the trip for the Tulsa guys. Our current venue is right in the middle. I'm still going to make the trip though it looks to be a hell of a time.
Drifting,36p7z5,creamypies2,1 point,Thu May 21 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"uhhhh yeah, haha, that track is worth even like a 500 miles drive each way, also it said hallett was in pawnee county of OK, also we kind have a simlar thing with idaho guys and utah guys where we have a track in the middle"
Drifting,36p7z5,creamypies2,1 point,Thu May 21 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah Hallett will be a trip for everyone if we get permission to have drift days out there, but I think turns 4,5,6 and 7,8,9 are both good chains."
Drifting,36p7z5,QuickStopRandal,3,Thu May 21 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/ChvCFus  you could go with the obvious red line, coming in from the pits, or if you get allowed circuit drifting (like constant with no staging) then id do the blue one, and then the revese flip around track is the yellow one"
Drifting,36p7z5,callmejeikob,1 point,Thu May 21 02:32:19 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of the blue line that does eliminate a lot of the awkward straights I was worried about. You could still enter it from the front straight as well so you get that first big entry. I'm not sure how they'll run it the track would be small if everyone that shows up to Stroud shows up here. Our last event had 2 lines of cars going from the start to just outside the course exit. I suspect there will be some waiting around if we do single runs so it may be better to cut it up into groups for a time limit. However most of the guys are new and haven't started getting in the tandem lines yet. I suppose it'll be slow for those guys either way.
Drifting,36p7z5,callmejeikob,2,Thu May 21 03:03:22 2015 UTC,If you can. And this is highly possible on thus track. You could try to get circuit kind of drifting like parc or like driftland uk or lile la grange USA. Basically if you can't do full circuit setup the staging along that really long straight near the back. So you can get a little run up to it. Then send people after they get past the second corner

Drifting,36lnrw,MajesticStag,6,Wed May 20 08:28:50 2015 UTC,"How much research have you done into this? Because there's much more to it than just bolting up a subframe. Especially the rolla chassis is much narrower than the FRS. (64 inches wide for the AE86 and 69.9 for the FRS). On top of that, there's more to the suspension than the subframe. you have the shock tower, control arm mounting points, caster, brakes, and so many other dimensions.   You also don't want electronic steering. No race car will have one. The MR2 rack will work in an AE86 if properly built and maintained. Non maintained ones have lots of slop and cause excessive resistance. Not to mention, even the FRS guys hate the factory steering and already have lots of kits to try and fix some of the issues.   If you really want a better front suspension, it's cheapest to just go with a different chassis. Besides, the front isn't so bad. It's your rear that hurts you the most when it comes to handling."
Drifting,36lnrw,protomor,2,Wed May 20 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"I haven't done any research into this it was just an idea, thanks for all your input its really helpful!"
Drifting,36lnrw,RotaryGo,3,Wed May 20 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"It would be somewhat unique, I don't think it's been done all this much at this point. I'd say it would come down to cost/worth. How much fab would be needed to get it to fit property? How different are the dimensions? I doubt that the dimensions are the same, so it wouldn't be as simple as welding up a few brackets. Do you plan on using this car for competition use? There are strict rules in changing/altering subframes. Also, parts tend to scale in price depending on the car, even if it's technically the same part. Parts for the FRS/BRZ will be more expensive compared to the AE86.  Personally, I'd find a new OEM subframe, there's still a ton of aftermarket support for the AE, and if you want electric steering, you could pull it from a MR2, I know there's information on that swap."

I find that if you want car knowledge, you go to your car specific forum. Sale sections are similar. Or regional FB groups. They tend to be a bi product of large forums. See nasioc as an example.  Really, that leaves drift events. But again, those are geographic based so at best you go to a forum or fb group for your region.   I whole heartedly wish we could have a global drift forum to share things like ackerman setups and driver tips. I just don't see it ever happening."

Keeping it to a handful of sections may help those sections be busier than it might be if there were lots of them etc. Apart from that it's just for fun really, and will be an ongoing project that I hope to evolve bit by bit over time.

Now had more money and bought some tomei procams, tomei valve springs and cam gears.  found out that my turbo's bearings (gt3071) were getting a bit shitty, decided on getting a GTX3071 instead :D  The fuel setup also got a overhual (from nismo 555's) and going e85 with bosch 2000cc injectors, raceworks top feed fuel rail, fuel lab fuel reg, and a walbro 455l intank pump  this setup should let me fry the tyres adn blow my box to bits in no time."

Drifting,35zcys,BlazinLoudNLow,10,Fri May 15 00:06:53 2015 UTC,During Chris's lead run Geoff had a lot of problems in the chase. So lets forget Geoff's lead run since they both went off. Now with Chris's lead run he made a clean lead run and Geoff had problems with straightening a couple times. Thats the reason. With Chris you gotta be crazy solid to get a win.   That said Geoff is killing it. Second year in pro and doing awesome. Car looks awesome he is awesome. East coast is best coast.
Drifting,35zcys,whyteboi,2,Fri May 15 03:51:56 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. Geoff didn't even have a lot of problems he flat out zero'd. They looked at only the drivers lead runs because both chases were zero's.
Drifting,35zcys,Shinny1337,1 point,Fri May 15 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's definitely killing it this year. I wouldn't be surprised to see him on the podium throughout next season or even this season.  STONE COLD STONEBACH"
Drifting,35zcys,luscious827,6,Fri May 15 16:37:27 2015 UTC,Forsberg had a bigger off! He clearly dropped 2 tires and that was just a robbery not going omt.
Drifting,35zcys,Waffeey,1 point,Fri May 15 01:29:40 2015 UTC,If it was just that run then yeah. But both drivers 0 their chase runs so the judges go to the lead runs. Forseberg didn't drop any tires and was better overall. If the judges didn't look at the whole battle that way we'd have OMT's every time both drivers had the same mistakes and the event would take forever. The one call fans should be questioning is Forsberg vs Tuerk.
Drifting,35zcys,Shinny1337,1 point,Fri May 15 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"Couldn't help feeling that way after the way the announcers were calling Forsberg's mistake, they must separate announcers from judges it's just unprofessional how the broadcast team gets a birds eye view of the judges to tend to rely on them for this information. That stated, it seemed much more in Stonebecks favor after the announcers comments and that contributed to the confusion for the fans."

Drifting,35zcys,RandomHero27,0,Fri May 15 05:56:28 2015 UTC,"He's very shallow that entire run, yes he was closer on one clip but that doesn't make up for how shallow his angle is."
Drifting,35zcys,Thelegassy,2,Fri May 15 12:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well it's hard to use that as an example we don't know for sure if the camera was doing the exact same thing. The S14's run it could be zoomed in a little closer causing us not to see the outer clip. But angle is judged separate from style. As far as style goes I would say he should be at least where the s14 was. I think black rims do hide too much, and they should ban rims darker than a certain shade so they can clearly see wheel movement and e brake use. It's part of the judging criteria and its like making the judges wear blurry glasses for some competitors."
Drifting,35zcys,Shinny1337,2,Fri May 15 15:28:13 2015 UTC,He left because he lost his pro1 license

IMO, I would have gone with a OMT just because tandem battles are cool and all tight battles should be a OMT just so the fans can shit their pants again. Gushi and Forsberg should totally have just kept on going until they ran out of tires. That shit was so cool. Also, while I'm at it, completely unrelated btw, pro snowboarders who compete should totally just ride the halfpipe like 5 times instead of just twice during competition. That quadruple cork 1440 whatever move that shaun white just did should be done multiple times so snowboarding fans can shit themselves more!"
Drifting,35zcys,Shinny1337,1 point,Fri May 15 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"Well to your original point remember LB. where they cut it by less than a minute from being fined for taking too long. Everywhere they go will have a schedule, noise codes etc they have to follow. Making an FD event take an extra 2 hours because tandems es cool would just get them in trouble and not invited back to venues. The judges use OMT when they can't make a decision."
Drifting,35zcys,zhultstrand,1 point,Fri May 15 15:31:37 2015 UTC,I didn't see that. I have seen him making comments about no Judges in Global Time Attack. Looking back at some events he was shafted. How do they loose you licenses?

Drifting,35n0kx,CogBlocker,3,Mon May 11 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"He's made it work for a long while now, and those Junkhouse/Risky Devil/PROCEED guys have always been about style and substance so it probably made sense to him initially to choose a chassis that you don't see sliding around very often. Here's a pre-livery shot of his car (from around 2010-2011 I think)"
Drifting,35n0kx,Dat_SilEighty,2,Tue May 12 01:12:22 2015 UTC,I owned one of these once with a 1jz. The most prominent memory I have of it was that it was heavy and with the targa top off the body would flex so much that closing the doors was was imposable to do if parked just right on a step incline not the mention the handling with the top off was terrible and danger-risk.    Even with the top on body flex was very notable. I think all the years of driving it without the top stressed the heavy body.  The best thing was the sound and killing BPU 350Zs while making that sound.
Drifting,35n0kx,HeyFux0r,2,Mon May 11 23:58:31 2015 UTC,"I had one as well, 7MGTE though. Can confirm, body flex was ridiculous. Still loved that car though."

I can't remember who but the lead driver caused the chase driver to run offline in outside zone 1.

Drifting,356xzk,chewie_were_home,1 point,Thu May 7 23:14:13 2015 UTC,Hard to get to fd? Pretty hard. Drifting in general is pretty easy compared to other sports. Setups go from mild to pretty wild. Most changes are tire pressure. Gear ratios and other basics like shocks.

Many of the events I traveled to it was the only exposure I got to these people. I'm at a race, it's practice for the championship. I'm there to win. I'll give you a short answer but not every race I go to is a social event.  Our local events I'm the first to walk around the paddock to talk and walk the course with newbies. I even show up sometimes to just teach new people when I don't have a car to run.   I've met people like me and I've met the people who can't turn it off. Usually if they can be kind at all during a race weekend they're fine any other time."

Drifting,356xzk,Shinny1337,1 point,Thu May 7 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"Haha racers are racers. At the rallycross championships they watered the course too much between some runs. I was trying to fight for the win, and the guy who was leading called his 15min. He just drove his car to his trailer and sat. I got to go out first in the mud bog. His time was 10 seconds faster than everyone else. I was talking to someone whose been in motorsports since the 70's, and he said that's just good rallying.   People talk about the 'dirty tricks' drivers do in FD, but its a competitive sport. The motto of F1 is, 'If you're not cheating you're not trying.' People will do anything to get a competitive edge. Rubbing's racing and all that."

As for what you want to get serious with. you mentioned not wanting to drift your e36 because it is kind of beat. Well drift cars get beat to hell. So its not like you are ruining anything haha. Its all personal preference but I think if you are already drifting the E36 and feel comfortable in it, might as well just continue with it instead of spending a lot more time and money on a Z33."

Also I do keep my arms on the steering wheel. Same with seats? How does the seat keep my legs from jittering or my leg muscles from twitching?
Drifting,34rho9,probablyhrenrai,1 point,Mon May 4 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"It's not about the jitters, to be clear.  Arms and/or legs are used to hold you in place if your seat isn't doing that for you. That's all."

Drifting,34rkll,that_aint_me_though,4,Sun May 3 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"So, first things first.  All you REALLY need for drifting is welded diff, having huge steering lock, bucket seats or harder suspension ofcourse helps, but you don't need it to beat your car a bit :)  The thing with sierra is, its great starter car, but not much else, so if you know the one prepped/used for drifting it might be good choice, buying a cheap stock one and welding a diff isn't a bad one either though.  Now, if you can afford let's say bmw e36 2.5+ sedan , it might be better option in a long run due to cheap mods and the fact that everything has been done with them already.  If you can't, buy a sierra, weld the diff and just have fun, don't overcomplicate it at first - yes, theres a shitton of things that are nice and will help you with nicer, better, faster skids, but if you will learn the basics on a weak, shitty car, you will be able to drift in a stronger and better prepped one - which might not work the other way around"
Drifting,34rkll,TIbbery,1 point,Mon May 4 00:18:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying, the thing about e36 is that every single one where I'm from has been drifted and abused and then it gets sold, there are no e36 that are stock or havent been abused and everyone that buys them regrets getting it because of its engine condition or smth. Don't get me wrong I love the way e36 or e30 look and I actualy dont like the way sierra looks at all but I think I have no other relatively cheap option than to buy a sierra."
Drifting,34rkll,TIbbery,2,Mon May 4 07:31:29 2015 UTC,"Mostly, yes, they been drifted and abused usually, altho, if you buy decent relatively cheap one, it will take alot of beating.  Sierra is a great car to start, and by all means, it will shred some tires, just be aware of it's limitations as a car from modding side"
Drifting,34rkll,TIbbery,1 point,Mon May 4 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"I will try my best and look through all of e36 i can get my hands on and if I don't find anything rideable I will buy a sierra cause no one is in a rush to buy these sieeras :D, can't say the same about bimmers. Do you advise getting nothing less than a 2.5?"
Drifting,34rkll,cluggy,2,Mon May 4 12:53:59 2015 UTC,"well, 2.5 or 2.8 would be ideal, but that doesn't mean 2.0 or 1.8is will be bad, just simply, be ready to swap the engine later on, the thing with bmw's is that you can swap the engine, get a cheap coilovers set and it will WORK for the most part, getting super-nice spec is expensive as in everything, but getting reasonable cheap spec is...cheap and it works."
Drifting,34rkll,cluggy,2,Mon May 4 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"I have a 2.0i sierra sapphire and imo there's better cars to learn in. You definitely can drift it but it was designed as a family saloon and handles/responds as such. I always say this but from my experience (and I do have both cars!) an mx5 would be a better starting point. It has a great suspension setup from stock, it's easy to fix when you break it and it's cheap too (engine is also bulletproof with basic maintenance).      However, if you want to get some seat time having a car that's drift ready is a big bonus, no messing about ordering parts, spending money and working on the car. I bought a drift ready is200 for that exact reason, so I had something to thrash while also working on my mx5 during the colder months.  Nothing worse than the car sitting on your driveway not ready while you're missing out on events and seat time which is the most important part of learning.   For anyone from the US reading the Ford Sierra he's talking about is very boaty in stock form and handles like a pig so I wouldn't blame you for wanting to lower it at least before you get started.   Do you have the list of mods for the Sierra? A lot of people on here will also recommend starting with a car that's stock and spending your money on seat time then upgrading the car as you go. If you have any questions about the Sierra let me know."
Drifting,34rkll,cluggy,1 point,Mon May 4 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that the sierra wasn't made to be used for drifting or any kind of car sport. I would be glad to own an mx5 but they are extremely rare to non existant where I'm from. The thing is that I believe that the sierra's that were drift prepped might be trashed but I'm only speculating and will need to see to be sure.   Most of the parts like springs/coils, bucket seats, steering wheels and what not are readily available near by so I think prepping one wouldn't be that bad but then again I haven't prepped one so I can't really tell until I prepp one.   The mod list isn't all that big appart from welded diff, bucket seat, stripped interrior, fuel tank in the trunk, widened steering lock and aftermarket suspension. I suppose all of this would cost more than the difference between a drift prepped sierra and a random dd sierra. But I think that if the engine has any problems it's not worth the hassle for any of them. If by the time I get my paycheck all of the sierras will be gone or the ones that are still in the market will have some sort of engine problems I will go for E36 if I will be able to find one whose horses are still under the bonnet and not in the field.   Thanks for your input it's very welcoming to see people that are willing to share their experience and knowledge."
Drifting,34rkll,cluggy,2,Mon May 4 18:34:58 2015 UTC,"It sounds like they've done a fair amount of work. If they've thrased it for years with no consideration for basic maintenance then walk away, it could cost you double/triple just to keep it running. If they've looked after it then it might be a bit of a bargain.   Best thing to do is go and have a look for yourself and see if they'll let you take it for a spin."

Drifting,34o5mr,ChadHardcastle,5,Sun May 3 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"God I fucking hate this sub for down voting my simple question. Half the video you're understeering and it's making you work extra at the wheel. The torsen diff doesn't like to stay sideways for very long so it causes even worse snap back. Which, considering you have a miata, is not going to help.   Next miata, assuming you're getting a miata, you want either a proper clutch type lsd or a welded diff. Your rear tires needed to be aired up. The moment you feel the understeer, slow down. It will only get worse and when the rear kicks out, your steering won't respond quickly because they are too busy scrubbing all over the track.   Front tires should be 30-35 range. Rear tires should be 50-60 assuming factory tire sizes/rims all around."

Drifting,34i3mm,fake_tea,2,Fri May 1 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't, I was just explaining why the car was so slide-ey.  Koenigseggs and many others suffer from the same lack of balance (balance meaning power vs. brakes vs. handling) in exchange for faster lap times.  On the flip side, an example of a well balanced car would be an FR-S, Miata, or a BMW 3 series.  They may not be as outright fast, but they have balance and finesse and really displays when a good driver is at the helm because of how well they will keep momentum through the track."
Drifting,34i3mm,QuickStopRandal,2,Fri May 1 20:57:53 2015 UTC,I dont think you really understand how good of a driver you have to be to control that car.

It's exactly the same if you drive it on an accurate sim like Gran Turismo.  Second, I do know how good of a driver you have to be because I am that good of a driver.  Those old Porsches are notoriously difficult to keep in check even at stock power levels, it's like a pendulum swinging in the rear at all times.  No matter how good of a driver you are, you have to be a little bit crazy to attempt to push one of these on a track like the Nurburgring, it could snap around uncontrollably at any time and end you, no matter how good or careful you are."

Drifting,347u6f,JUSTWANNACUDDLE,3,Wed Apr 29 07:07:14 2015 UTC,"Forza doesn't have steering angle modifications. Its one of the things they desperately need to change. We need to be able to make 6 second supras with huge ass rear slicks, and drift cars that have huge steering angle and can fit the kinds of tires the pro's are using today. You can get 1000hp into an S13 in Forza 4 but it has stock steering and 235's I believe at most. You just can't make extreme builds like people are doing in the real world today. Which is a little sad, you would think the video game would have the more unreal options."

Drifting,348fy3,mowbuss,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"Well that's probably the toughest one to call I've seen. I believe it is based on the way the chase car lurched on impact. It wasn't a huge hit that caused a full spin but he basically planted the tread of his tire flat on the lead car's door. I could see that causing the little bit of extra angle the lead car couldn't come back from. I don't think we could know for sure unless we had telemetry data from all their runs. It could be the lead driver was slower than he had been causing the chase driver to make contact, but idk that IDC monitors speeds like FD does."
Drifting,3459nb,devistation,15,Tue Apr 28 12:21:25 2015 UTC,"First off. Stop thinking about how you look to others. That only messes up your mental game. You think people on stage on broadway or playing professional sports are fixated on the people watching? Nah.  Second. People don't expect more from you because you have a 370z. They actually expect less. Newer nice cars (with stock exterior) tend to have fewer mods. Factory cars tend not to drift well.   Third, Without driving your car, I can't tell you for sure. But here's what I think:   Make sure your car is setup properly. An alignment is key. The front wheel will not track if your toe is off. Shit tires rear. Grip tires front. If same tires, up the rear pressure for easier skids. NO shit front tires. EVER. Don't even show up if your front tires are worn. Newbs tend to have a death grip on the steering wheel. You have to let the steering wheel slide through your fingers the moment you start a drift. If you don't and you react late, you'll immediately spin. That good alignment (See #1) will make the car steer faster than you can. If you are spinning constantly, you're either not letting go of the wheel fast enough or your front end is understeering and not responding. The front not responding could be shit tires or again, bad alignment.  If you straighten out immediately, you either aren't kicking the clutch hard enough or you're going too fast. Probably both. A clutch kick needs to have enough rpm difference to spin the wheels. 1k rpm difference in second gear is not enough. Some people let off the clutch half heartedly. Dump that bitch. If you're going too fast in second gear, even slipping the tires a bit won't help you and the rear will catch up. If you're going over 30mph, it's too fast. I recommend most newbs start 15-20mph with factory stuff. Shit happens much slower in first gear. Second gear is a new ball game. You can probably compensate in first gear because it's slower and you have confidence.   Assumptions You have the VLSD option (not open diff) and there is no clutch delay valve in your system. I don't know 370zs too well."
Drifting,3459nb,protomor,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd like to see a vid of his driving. Car options will make it easier but he should be able to overcome that stuff if he's got good instruction. Except an open diff of course. I'd say improper steering input is the most likely culprit. It's the first thing I have to correct new people on. I also wonder about his throttle input, some people don't naturally take to the way a car feels when it breaks the tire grip leading to some choppy throttle."
Drifting,3459nb,Shinny1337,3,Tue Apr 28 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"It's because you have an open diff.  It's damn near impossible to drift with an open diff, weld it or swap it for an LSD and you'll be sliding around in no time.  And yeah don't worry about how you look, nobody cares, we're all just happy you're out there giving it a shot."
Drifting,3459nb,halycon8,-1,Tue Apr 28 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"I have no idea whats that, does it REALLY make a huge a difference?"
Drifting,3459nb,SpicyBigDad,7,Tue Apr 28 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"If you dont even know what an LSD is and you want to get into drifting you are gonna have a bad time.  Do research, more than you think is necessary. With that knowledge will come skill and experience the more you implement that knowledge.  Kids who get into motorsports without good knowledge of the subject ALWAYS have a bad time, and they're a dime a dozen.   People wont hold your hand through the whole thing. So you are going to have to learn a lot on your own."
Drifting,3459nb,halycon8,4,Tue Apr 28 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Hands down it is by far the most important part of drifting.  I can not stress the importance of it enough.  You could have a 100,000 amazing drift car but without a locking diff it will be completely useless. I don't mean to sound like a dick but if you don't know what an LSD or welded diff is, you really need to more research before you get out there and try drifting again.  Watch something called the ""drift bible"" and it might help, I'm sure there's plenty of videos on youtube that are good too but here's the basics.    You need a locking diff.  Steering angle is very important.  A car with amazing angle and no power will out-drift a car with tons of power and no angle all day.  Power isn't important, especially not if you're in a 370z.  You have more than enough power.  Stiffen up your chassis and suspension.  Coilovers, sway bars, strut tower braces, etc.  The stiffer and lower your car is, the better.  It's all about seat time.  Don't worry much about building your car, learn how to drive it first.  A stock 370z with an LSD is a great platform to learn on.  Managing the throttle is almost more important than managing the steering wheel, let the wheel do it's thing more or less and only firmly adjust it when needed, it's very important to find out when to let off the gas and when to mash it. Kick it and flick it, have fun.  Drifting is all about fun."
Drifting,3459nb,mowbuss,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"Dont tell newbs that steering angle is important. Its not. It only becomes important when you reach the limits of the stock lock, then and only then should you modify to suit."

Drifting,3459nb,gillbilly72,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"Something to consider: wheel speed  The higher your wheel speed relative to your actual speed, the more twitchy and reactive to inputs the car is. For example, if you're going 30 mph in second, it's probably about right, and the car will behave normally. If it's going the same speed in third (assuming you have the torque to do this) the car is going to try to spin out because of the difference in wheel speed.   What may be contributing is that your second gear is really long, so when you try to rev up the wheel speed is too much.  this is almost definitely not the main cause but it's something to think about, as it may actually be easier to drive a bit faster.  my suggestion to you is to try a long left or right turn in second. kick the clutch, let it break grip, then let it recover, keep adding throttle until you can find the point where it's balanced without spinning out, and then you know how much gas to give it when you initiate"

Drifting,3459nb,TrentonH1,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess because you're new to it, 2nd gear is just faster than you're used to.  1st gear maxes out quick so it's easy to control, but in 2nd it's that much faster so you have even less traction.  Don't go all out, just approach a corner like you're about to drift it, but only spin the wheels for a second, and then try to regain control.  Once you get the hang of what the steering wheel is doing, try doing it for longer."
Drifting,3459nb,ShadynastyS14,-5,Wed Apr 29 01:41:13 2015 UTC,"My guess: Higher RPM = more wheel spin and torque, thus, losing more traction persay, but getting better slides that are easier to control. Since your car is stock, 2nd gear may not have enough torque for you to drift at that low of a speed."

Drifting,33o476,MelsEpicWheelTime,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:04:16 2015 UTC,Well to be sure it's near impossible to distinguish between the sound but you wouldn't be using anti lag on the limiter. It would be pointless to do so when you are already making enough boost to spin the tires up to the limiter for that gear.
Drifting,33o476,geargasgo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:13:24 2015 UTC,It is called anti lag.  Its keeping the turbo spooled up so there is no lag.  Basically it is shooting a flame through the turbo to keep it spinning.  Correct me if I am wrong /r/Drifting

I still drive it daily.  An LSD is nicer for daily driving and better on the car but of course much more expensive and still prone to breaking.  If you were to ever have a build that was serious enough to warrant the cost of a DCCD type system or pneumatic locking diff, there's NO way you'd still be driving it on public roads so the point of having one is moot."
Drifting,33j5f1,halycon8,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:21:39 2015 UTC,Just go clutch type LSD with carbon clutches. A stiffer inner spring if possible and sometimes they can be pre-loaded before being put in the housing. All that makes the LSD closer to full lock.

If you have it and you are worried about the performance then I guess you have the 2.0.

The violent weight transfer should unsettle the car. If that doesn't work, adding a dab of the brakes before kicking the clutch should do it (to transfer load off of the rear wheels) Edit: you might be able to slide by downshifting without rev matching or shift locking but you might spin out a few times  https://youtu.be/IGFeugl4BLg"

Drifting,33cd03,Griffin-dork,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:41:56 2015 UTC,Neutral throttle when feinting: not accelerating or decelerating. There's a tendency to understeer when you feint though so you have to be smooth. No worries man have fun  drifting! (While I study for exams :(
Drifting,33cd03,Griffin-dork,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"And yeah just give it some quick gas, or If you're shift locking: clutch in, brake, clutch out"
Drifting,33cd03,bent-grill,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"You definitely dont need an ebrake, or more power. Low powered drifting teaches you a lot about car control and technique.   For starters though, I would make sure the car is up on maintenance. Give the engine a tune up if it hasnt been done in a while, and make sure all the suspension components arent worn out (ball joints, bushings, tie rod ends, etc.)  Then just to make sure the car is predictable, I would highly suggest a decent set of coilovers and a welded diff (LSD CAN work but I dont really recommend it for drifting).   After that just get out onto a track (Street drifting is bad mmkay?) and get seat time. Go fast and flick HARD into the corners. With low power you arent going to be picking up speed while drifting, you will go in fast and come out of the corner much slower. If needed flick and clutch kick at the same time. With my stock KA in my S13, I cant really clutch kick normally, I have to clutch it, build revs, then pop the clutch. That is still considered a clutch kick though.   Other than that, there really isnt much more someone can tell you to do. A lot of drifting it like riding a bike. A person can sit there and explain every finite detail about it but until you actually get behind the wheel and suck for a bit, you wont be able to do it. Most people at events are very friendly though and will be more than happy to watch you do a run and offer any pointers."
Drifting,33cd03,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"hey thanks for the long answer! good to know the car is capable and its just my inexperience holding me back haha!  the car is in good condition, plus I have some coilovers already in. Im not sure what im gonna do about the diff, I cant weld and havent found someone yet who can and is willing to do it. maybe I just have to do it myself.  and dont worry, Im not srewing around on the streets, for now it has been only parking lots and backroads far from traffic. but yeah I need to get to a track to really go hard safely.  thanks for the tips!"
Drifting,33cd03,ShadynastyS14,2,Tue Apr 21 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Thats good to hear, but if you are not an experienced welder, DO NOT attempt to do it yourself. Any experienced welder can do it. If you have any local drifting groups on facebook or anything like that, post in there saying you need someone to weld a diff for you. Should find someone willing to do it for like $50. Just drop the diff and take it to them, once they are done just fill it back with fluid and throw it back in the car.   As for practicing, stay off of even back roads. COMPLETELY empty parking lots are fine just be aware you can still get kicked out of there by police if anyone complains. If it happens to be the property owner itself then you can be fined for trespassing, but most of the time it will just be a noise complaint and they will ask you to leave. I still say just stick 100% to the track. Most of the US will have regular drift events within 1-2 hours from you at least once a month. In the Northeast we are lucky and have ClubLoose that organizes a SHIT ton of events as well as Drift Cleveland just over in Ohio.  Good luck and remember, its all about having fun. Doesnt matter if you suck for a while, just have fun and thats all that matters."

Drifting,33cd03,Chris_nuisance,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:29:47 2015 UTC,A wet parking lot is also a good place to get a feel for it. Because of the low traction situation you can tune your steering input without curbing your car too hard. Good luck.
Drifting,33cd03,joker151,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"BMW clutch type diffs are known to wear out easy, or be long dead by the time you buy the car.  Might be time to rebuild the diff and add a clutch plate, or buy an open and have it welded.  Also more details on setup.  Tires, wheels, suspension?  Clutch kicking is about timing.  Got to get the weight to transfer the way you want it to go as you kick. If you start to loose RPM's or speed in a drift, kick again.  Didn't gain enough RPM on that last kick?  Kick again."

Took her home, dropped her off, she was leaving to go to her lake house so we pulled out together. I hit the back end of her car when she pulled out. Hows that for a first date. Her dad came out and laughed at us then walked back inside lol."

I over corrected trying to drift and ended up up a gutter and resting on a now bent no standing sign. I have a pic somewhere.  The next crash that was my fault was after a solid 4 to 5 hours of hills driving and dirt roading in my ke70, i wasnt paying attention, pannicked and put the poor thing into a guard rail at 60kmph  The most recent crash in the s13 track car.... my mate wanted to smash my reae bar because he didnt like it. So i beat him to it and hit 3 tyre bundles smashing the bar off."

Drifting,33bmcy,Entriel,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"If you think about what the word ""accident"" means, you would see that it has nothing to do with how experienced you are with the thing you are doing. So in this context no one is above having accidents. They occur despite your best efforts, you are not all mighty...  Many of us are walking around since we were 2, this doesn't stop us from tripping and falling every once in a while.  We're speaking our native language everyday, this doesn't stop us from making slip of the tongue.  Can anyone tell me that I'm not experienced enough with walking or speaking my native language?  Honestly I think that it is good, you feeling embarrassed. It will lead you to be more humble about your skill, and it will also make you more vigilant when you are on the wheel.  Other than that, I felt sorry that you had an accident. Still be happy that it's nothing serious. Even though I don't know you, I believe that anyone's proud( or self esteem) can get over having a little accident :)...  I wish you an accident free life(at least when you are on the wheel :P)."

I used to pride myself on my ticket and accident free driving and went on about 8 years of driving till I had my first accident, a fender bender when I accidentally rolled down an inclined exit of a parking lot into someone (240 took a surprising amount of damage for a 1mph impact while the van I bumped got a paint chip.). Its bound to happen at some point and at least it was probably pretty minimal damage to a friends car."

Drifting,337hc4,lastvegas,2,Tue Apr 21 01:38:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I know...  I tried finding one worth getting and everyone wanted 8k for a beat up 240sx.. And the clean ones were like 15k..
Drifting,337hc4,Muthafuxajones,2,Mon Apr 20 15:00:51 2015 UTC,Damn.. I see most stock 240s go anywhere from 2-4k depending on condition. Also seen a few Sr swapped 24 go for around 5.. Most of which are in half decent condition. Even stock ka24 autos go for as little as 3

Drifting,33a535,protomor,3,Mon Apr 20 21:37:51 2015 UTC,I like forwards pointing at the front wheel and where you're going.

Drifting,33a535,BadManBruce,2,Mon Apr 20 22:48:33 2015 UTC,This angle works best on actual tracks. If your events take place in a parking lot it'll just looks like ground going by a tire pointed at a weird angle. I got some ok video by mounting it above and slightly behind the tire rather than low down fully behind the tire. It gives a better perspective of whats happening. Though it'll still look boring without editing haha.

I could maybe see $8k-10k since its clean and has been painted inside and out.    Modifying your car doesn't add that much value, also no one cares what his share of the rent was.    At $12k im guessing he bought it pre-swapped with most of this work already done, or he bought the most overpriced s13 ever."

The car was 12k back then, the cage was 4500, the paint job was 4000 (not including every interior surface, the cage and the whole underbody which had to be brushed and all of that coated with 2 layers of black epoxy paint). The engine rebuild was over 5000 and then you have a bunch of 1000$ things like every single brake line and hydraulic hand brake, the ""painless"" wiring harness of the entire car, the tuning on a dyno.   That thing has been a bottomless money pit !  After all of that, going to the track is an extra 500$ a day !! (track rental, trailer rental, truck fuel, race car fuel, at least 6 tires) so I guess that's why he's called it quits."

Drifting,32z80a,creamypies2,3,Sat Apr 18 04:49:31 2015 UTC,i think thats where his question is heading. like how much do those guys make?
Drifting,32z80a,RandomHero27,3,Sat Apr 18 05:00:49 2015 UTC,"ahh, I dont think they make a lot, I just think they get the best on job perks hahah"
Drifting,32z80a,creamypies2,2,Sat Apr 18 07:52:33 2015 UTC,Its the same in most motorsports. Every bit of your winnings goes into next season. Its just that the guys at the top will have bigger budgets as a result.

Drifting,32z80a,creamypies2,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"If you are asking about you personally making money please be aware that there isn't really any money to be made from driving unless you already do it. People who make a living driving have been doing it from a young age and someone has invested a lot of time and money to get them there. Seat time is very expensive and you have to have a lot of it in order to be paid. In addition to just driving in events a lot of drivers work doing driving instruction and driver coaching for other drivers.   But a $300k purse really isn't much if you think of all of the costs involved. You need a car, tools, consumables like fuel, tires, brakes, fluids, you need to transport all of this to the event and you need to pay, feed and house a crew to be there, registration and event fees can quickly be thousands. It's all very costly. You'd be surprised how many professional drivers are paying to be there."
Drifting,32z80a,Mewse_,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"wouldnt the 300k purse also go to the team, technically, because if like gitten wins, or forsberg wins, I wonder how much they actually see of that prize money"
Drifting,32z80a,creamypies2,2,Sat Apr 18 04:50:52 2015 UTC,Generally the crew is going to get paid regardless of how the car and driver do. There may or may not be a crew bonus for winning the season. I would think that has everything to do with who pays the bills.

Unfortunately my my friends dad who was going to sell me his rotting S4 with a blown engine decided it was worth more than a few hundred and decided to keep it.

The PO daily drove it to work and when the head gasket went on the KA he sold it. I rebuilt the head and put it on with a new head gasket and its been a dead reliable car to both daily and drift. Now it mostly sits and just goes to the tracks on weekends but I am in the process of rebuilding all of the suspension and fixing a few other small issues, so afterwards it should be a fun car to drive on the street and drift."
Drifting,32lm7s,mowbuss,4,Wed Apr 15 14:01:27 2015 UTC,And people want factory condition prices for scrap yard condition cars. I'll happily pay up to $2k for a running s13 in 20 year old condition. You're high out of your mind if you think I'm going to pay $4k for a ghetto rigged piece that is 6 different colors and not a single straight panel that is 100lbs less than the original curb weight due to rust and dollar store electrical tape (basically non adhesive plastic strips) holding half the wiring together.

Drifting,32lm7s,titsonalog,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Oh well yeah, definitely. depending on your level of mechanical ability, a car can be had for under a grand. Then you get to fixing it, putting coilovers on it, and welding the diff. Youre in it for another 1500-2000. Or just buy a ready to drift car for probably around $3k. Then factor in entry fees, oil, gas, and tires (if you choose to buy them, most people rummage through scrap tire bins), To get yourself up and going for a season all in all, its probably $5-6k. Not crazy expensive or anything at all, but if you are already living paycheck to paycheck, You definitely cant fit it in. I had it lucky, I used to be a mechanic and bought a car, bone stock with just a blown head gasket for $700. Then buying used shit here and there and parts donations from a few friends, I was on track and drifting for about $1500. Its different for everyone however."

And would you rather be buying 4 of things like plugs, injectors, etc or 6? The 10% extra adds up real quick when you're talking about high use things that tend to break when using the cars for stuff like drifting. E30s and E36s are definitely excellent options to break into the sport/hobby since they basically require little set up to get on the track but s-chassis is still much easier...for now."

You can also find an e36 that will have a longer wheelbase and a little more power/torque.  rx7 - also drift, and you already know about the rotary  Try to find something that has been maintained well.  If you find something that has been beaten up for less, even better.  Do a general maintenance on the car (replace fluids, check plugs, etc.) and start drifting.  You should try to limit upgrading until you break something or feel that you are ready to benefit from the upgrade.    Other possible chassis: Lexus SC300, IS300 Foxbody Cressida  tl;dr: Find something cheap that won't hurt your wallet as much when you crash and get as much seat time as possible."

Drifting,32bgif,creamypies2,3,Sun Apr 12 19:37:10 2015 UTC,It's a depowered rack. Disconnecting it will result in the steering feeling terrible.
Drifting,32bgif,22quack,3,Sun Apr 12 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. This is a properly depowered rack, not just looped lines or disconnected power steering. The feedback is amazing. You can feel right where the wheels need to be. Turning at a dead stand still takes some effort, but if you inch forward while youre doing it, it isn't a problem at all. I dailly'd this car over the winter and never hated my life."

Drifting,32bgif,ugwo2ng,2,Sun Apr 12 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"For more power, yes. With manual steering, the faster you go the more effort it takes. For lower power(~250hp and below) I think manual steering is great. I've become a much smoother driver since installing this rack. I had 3 racks start leaking on me, so I finally gave up and had a buddy who has converted probably 100 racks to manual convert mine for me."
Drifting,32bgif,krauzz,2,Sun Apr 12 21:02:42 2015 UTC,I would try to do some research to see if you'd prefer a depowered steering rack versus a manual steering rack if you haven't done so already.  Depowered racks have a quicker steering ratio and has a much easier DIY process compared to a manual rack.

Although Forrest Wang has always piloted a more ""stylish"" car I just think this one further emphasizes that you can definitely be competitive and stay true to the roots.     To me, most US Pro Cars aren't even real cars, they are ridiculous race ships plastered in whatever tacky marketing scheme their sponsors have them run. Its always far more exciting for me to see pretty cars which are based on street chassis getting down hard.

The junkyard way to get a decent setup is by using S13 FLCA (around 1"" longer), XM steering arms (or cut and welded stock ones), RCAs, and an X7 rack. The rear is good enough as is. Dropping the car gives it a little negative camber out back."

Drifting,321jwd,Nigel_Vertigo,0,Fri Apr 10 07:52:29 2015 UTC,"You could just extend the stock arms, but if you can't weld, then you can get s13 arms for under $50 and the extra length gives you a good amount of camber up front. The x7 rack has a faster ratio, so less turns of the wheel lock-to-lock.  I haven't done it to my car yet, but my planned setup is basically that."
Drifting,321jwd,creamypies2,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:41:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I also saw an s14 rack conversion. But that seems even more extreme.  Also s13 FLCA ' s extended ?

We have a lot of downtime at work right now and I work with an engineer that was on Ken Gushi's team back when he drove for ford racing.

Drifting,31yv9f,eLetoR,2,Thu Apr 9 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"The xcessive arms are just a fancy version of cut and shut arms, since the steering arm is its own seperate piece.  The roll center adjuster is the key component for reducing bump steer, also a lot of guys relocate the rack as well.  And yeahhhh.....its going to be....pricey  Xcessive's prices are really good for everything, there is no way I could be that because I could never get my volumes high enough to do it.  There are like 4 people in the US with a well put together drift mx83 that I could market to."
Drifting,31yv9f,CompleteXen,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"what does cut and shut mean ?   also yeah I figured it would be pricey, also kinda figured the same for your arms, but I figured they would be better quality. (xessive's just kinda look like sticks)  also kinda a suspesnion newb, but how would a roll center adjuster effect anything when it comes to bump steer?   also what are you doing to setup the rear of the car ?"
Drifting,31yv9f,username2110,2,Fri Apr 10 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"The most basic explanation of a roll center adjuster is that it lowers the car by raising the wheel mount spindle.  So it doesn't change the geometry as much.  Xcessive makes some pretty nice stuff, so I wouldn't worry to much.  Eventually I want to revise the rear geometry, but for now I'm going to just start with xcessive links and bushing."

But I'll give you a price when I finish them up.  A group buy will be the easiest way for me to get the price down so I can have them made 5-10 at a time.  Spreads the CNC cost out across a few pieces instead of 1 set.

Drifting,321ezs,ShadynastyS14,3,Thu Apr 9 20:53:09 2015 UTC,Today is tech day so no driving.  I crew for sikky. Alignment changes are as needed but we tend not to do more than toe since we don't have a laser machine here. Toe is quick and cheap to do.  Pits are funny. Everyone is rear mount rad and hating working on it. Anyone with a newer chassis complains about weight or long wheel base. Lots more nos than I remember from previous years. Lots of aluminum crash areas allowing for front and rear hitting with no functional damage.
Drifting,321ezs,Vikinglobster,2,Thu Apr 9 21:11:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I was pretty intrigued by Forest Wang's aluminum bash bar.  The concept makes sense.

Drifting,31tr4z,autoHQ,3,Wed Apr 8 02:18:41 2015 UTC,did they not come in all wheel drive?
Drifting,31tr4z,minnion,9,Wed Apr 8 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"On the Volkswagen website if you select the model and then select technical data it appears that all 2015 model years are front wheel drive. However on wikipedia under the 2014 B8 model it states that 2.0 TDI SCR BlueMotionTechnology model was available with optional AWD platform.  Edit: On SpeedHunters the car is referred to as a ""Tanner Foust’s 2015 Volkswagen Passat Drift Car"".  In the same article it also states that ""In order to convert the Passat from front-drive to rear-drive, the car would need some serious chassis and suspension fabrication, and great care was taken to make sure that everything adhered to the Formula Drift rulebook"".  So to answer the question I would say yes it is front wheel drive, but the cars original firewall was left in place in accordance with the rule book."
Drifting,31tr4z,TwinkieMuncher,2,Wed Apr 8 03:43:49 2015 UTC,Euro spec TDI Passats use 4 motion.
Drifting,31tr4z,yeaExtraa,3,Mon Apr 13 04:36:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it doesn't matter if they did.  Most AWD set ups have the motor mounted in a FWD fashion with a transfer case and a puny drive shaft to the rear.  He's running a full on LS V8, that transmission and drive shaft isn't going to fit in an AWD tunnel"

I always though that rule was for beating out the transmission tunnel to fit a T56 or some larger transmission.    But I guess ""modification"" could mean beating it out, or straight up cutting it like what Foust had to do"
Drifting,31tr4z,Troggie42,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:05:21 2015 UTC,Well everything says it's up to the technical guy to approve regardless so there could be exemptions.
Drifting,31tr4z,ff200,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:09:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If the tech guy says it's safe, it's OK. You don't want a firewall sawzalled apart and booger welded back together, but if you cut and weld it properly and safely, it should not be an issue."
Drifting,31tr4z,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:59:25 2015 UTC,The tranny tunnel is huge on those cars I doubt he had to make little or any modifications
Drifting,31tr4z,Waffeey,2,Wed Apr 8 11:00:01 2015 UTC,They are allowed to modify a portion of the firewall/tunnel to accept a larger transmission.  Also if they are running a gsr 4 speed like most other teams I can tell you from personal experience that they are tiny for what they are.  I'm just curious how the rear suspension modifications fall within the rule book.
Drifting,31tr4z,adamthebeast,2,Wed Apr 8 06:18:28 2015 UTC,Same situation with Aasbo's Scion car right? Stock fwd with huge conversions that barely are found legal by technicalities but who cares.. they will always find ways around rules but i suppose they just don't cut the firewall?
Drifting,31tr4z,ProJoe,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:26:48 2015 UTC,It also has to maintain factory subframe from what I understand. And I think I know a certain Norwegian who has not adhered.

I've never seen one drift well. I feel like it has similar issues to the IS250 covered here except that there's more of them.

I think everything is there for an is300 to be a good pro drift car, (angle kits, it's not too big or too small, pretty decent aftermarket, documented 2jzgte, 1jzgte, ls v8 swaps etc.) it just hasn't been campaigned enough."

Drifting,31rlxn,driftsc,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:01:51 2015 UTC,Sc300 is far superior. Not in weight but in aftermarket
Drifting,31rlxn,CompleteXen,2,Wed Apr 8 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"This is a shot in the dark, but maybe check out the Y34 (Infiniti M45). Their price is dropping fast (seeing them for $3,000-$5,000 locally), only came in auto but a swap wouldn't be too difficult, plus it has a VK45DE V8."

Over the last 2 years our events have gone from barely filling up the day before an event, to being at max capacity hours after registration opens.  Which is actually super frustrating.  Until we start adding more events to the season for ClubFR or venues that can support a larger drivers cap I kind of wish it would lose popularity for a while.  I just want seat time without having to blow a thousand dollars on early registration for the entire season in March."
Drifting,31p9hw,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:44:36 2015 UTC,Yeah it's getting big. Our first event had over 200 spectators and around 40 drivers. Last year it was half the drivers and maybe 30 spectators.

Drifting,31p9hw,minnion,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:30:07 2015 UTC,DN used to have 80 drivers and about 100 spectators. Driver count is down lately. I'm not sure why spectator count is up though.   But I don't think this year is any different. I have to constantly explain to people what drifting is. So many people tell me they've never heard of fast and furious.

Drifting,31m75c,lil_ian69,0,Tue Apr 7 06:36:11 2015 UTC,well I've never actually done either. I've only done backwards donuts in my dinky little fwd. However I'm sure that both of them are a blast to do. I think it all comes down to personal opinion.

Drifting,317tvt,ProJoe,24,Thu Apr 2 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"and now you have learned the hard way why especially a beginner, should not do it.  go to the track."
Drifting,317tvt,llut5at,4,Thu Apr 2 21:46:47 2015 UTC,No guarantee that wouldn't happen there.
Drifting,317tvt,ProJoe,6,Thu Apr 2 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"you are right, there is no guarantee. but I can tell you as someone who has gone to hundreds of events and built more drift courses in parking lots than I can count, it is a LOT harder to fuck up and crash on a closed course like a skidpad or giant parking lot versus the street.   of course no 2 tracks/facilities are the same and there are always ways to crash but for an amateur skidpad event, it is very difficult."
Drifting,317tvt,Nigel_Vertigo,4,Thu Apr 2 23:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really not condoning street drifting in any way, I just thought I'd point out that some tracks have walls that I've seen eat cars alive.  Yes there are events out there with large grassy areas to spin out on, ore a big parking lot, but there are also tracks that have like 5 places to total your car.  That said I don't street drift less because I don't trust myself and more because I both don't trust other drivers and I'd rather spend my money at the track than on a giant reckless driving ticket and risk losing my licence."

Drifting,3106xm,packinamac,2,Wed Apr 1 11:37:45 2015 UTC,"They're really not that great, honestly.  They were made popular by initial D and had some advanced technology for its time but still only produces like 130hp.  Other than that it is a light weight rwd with a 50/50 weight distribution and can weigh less than a miata.   I feel it's kind of a grass is greener on the other side effect because Sprinter Truenos* weren't released in America.  That being said I would still love to own or drive one.  *Edited for pedants"
Drifting,3106xm,Staub007,5,Wed Apr 1 13:26:34 2015 UTC,They're great for what they are.  They're not a numbers car that's concerned with lateral g's or 0 to 60 times. They're lightweight and organic and just fun.  It's only concerned with putting a big smile on your face.  It's the kind of car that does a lot with a little.
Drifting,3106xm,ish_mel,3,Wed Apr 1 15:12:16 2015 UTC,What in the hell are you talking about. The 85 through 87 corolla GTS is the same exact thing as the tureno minus the some fancy lights and bumpers. The were sold in america. source:  i own one and have worked on many.

I'd say that's a pretty big difference for an engine with such small output.  I'm not saying it's not a legendary car by itself, only comparing it to more modern lightweight low-output cars."

Thats it.  Period.  Seriously.  No turbo LS swap, wisefab, rollcaged, fuel cell, rear mount radiator, i saw it on formula drift so I have to have it build yolo swag shit.  You will never finish it, you will miss out on so much seat time, and when you do finally finish it you are going to look like an idiot for having this crazy car and no idea how to drive it.  You do not need more power than a stock KA to drift.   You will learn so much more sliding a low power car than jumping right into a high power one."

Then if you get the hang of it and would like to progress further, you can find a car that is more built or then build your own once you know more about drifting."
Drifting,30xg5r,Nytr1k,4,Tue Mar 31 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"I looked for cheaper and when I hit like the 2-3k market I usually find cars that are barely running, rusted, or have problems that need at least a thousand to run. Would you happened to know any beginner cars that are easy to fix and problems to stay away from when looking at used car around that price?"
Drifting,30xg5r,BrokenNumbers,2,Tue Mar 31 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly miata... It's rwd, almost always miata, it can be skiddish when going faster and sliding around but it's fun. Super easy to work on and find parts, and usually relatively cheap as well. Picked mine up for $2600 or something, but it's needed work (oil leak, brakes, clutch died right after I bought it, stuff like that). Main thing to look for in Miatas is that the top doesn't leak, trunk doesn't leak because rust. Get it checked at a shop like normal.  But if you're opposed to Miatas like a lot of people then I would suggest 240 like you are, or maybe Mark3 supra, but I've heard bad things about them. BMW 325i is also a good car with power, can find some for 3k, but idk maintenance on them because german car. Fox body mustang is like a hidden drift legend. But pretty much any car that's RWD and manual should work. Watch out for rotary engines though (RX-7s etc) because hard and constant maintenance on them."
Drifting,30xg5r,desolatemindspace,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"I'll try to find a miata. They run a bit cheaper in my area. One of the reasons I stayed away because people said it was harder to drift due to the short wheelbase. So that's why my obvious choice was 240sx, a similarly priced car and parts are cheap. I guess my questions is, since I've never driven these cars, does the shorter wheelbase affect drifting that much? Is it good for a beginner?"
Drifting,30xg5r,desolatemindspace,2,Tue Mar 31 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"E30, hell even e36 maybe, foxbody, miata, an old corolla not just the 84-87 corolla was rwd, 84 and older celica, 200sx. Cressida.

Drifting,30xg5r,capitlj,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:52:46 2015 UTC,Yeah those are pretty good choices. I'm staying away from the BMW because of repairs and maintenance.

Drifting,30xg5r,Nytr1k,3,Tue Mar 31 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Have it looked at by a shop up on a rack? Compression test. Frame damage. Rust. Ect.   That's my best advice really.  I dug up the thing I wrote.  I'm going to go out and guess you already have a daily driven car? Good. Now that we have that cleared up here's a few cars you might look for. Camaro for maximum mullet. Have little to no experience with them but have watched a couple of stock f body cars get down. Mustang for murica. This is your suggestion. I probably wouldn't get one or the Camaro but hey. They have been done. Old corolla, no not ae86 but older, 83 and older te/ae71 can be had for cheap friend bought one running and driving with a mostly straight body for $400, needed a manual swap though. 200sx, aftermarket is kind of tough since you mostly just convert 240sx partd but hey, cut the springs weld the diff. Bam. You good to crash into a wall. Mk2/Mk3 supra 83-92, these can be snatched for cheap from time to time. The mk3 are absolutely notorious for head gasket failures but fear not you can fix that with a bit of work and some help from the local machine shop and the updated tsrm! It's a straight six up front. with rear drive and sometimes a turbo! (Also see cressida would need manual swap) Miata/e30/240sx. Obvious choices and even a beat one will still be fun. Good aftermarket. Lots of knowledge info. If you have one of these I can tell you that cool idea you had. Ya it's probably been done, twice. Lastly the ae86. I have had 5 of these shit boxes and I have this immense love hate woth them. Honestly would not recommend for a first drift car. But you can learn to drift in one. And you can occasionally still find one for a reasonable price. Always good for a smash into a wall. Or someone's door. The aftermarket is spotty, the community is full of retards (in a good way) and you'll be frustrated by the price of everything. But I'd say at the end it's worth it? Maybe? Or maybe I've just gone insane. So, now that you have the car thing sorted. HOW ARE YOU GONNA LEARN ULTRA MAD JDM TYTE REVERSE ENTRY SWAG DRIFTING. You are gonna learn by failing. And failing. And failing. And spinning. And wrecking. And spinning. And then holy shit. You made a corner! My honest to god suggestion and not many take me seriously on this. Go autocross first. Taka aono started in autocross. Why can't you. It will teach you car control, maybe not drifting, but control. How to react when the car steps out naturally. Get the feel for your car. Learn how it is to push 100%. I know lots of crazy street guys. I don't think any of them push ""one hunnit"" on the streets. I know I never have. Then go hit up a local event. Depending where you are. Might even. Be a drift school somewhere. Good luck, have fun, be safe."

I didn't build a drift car out of it but i did drift a lot in the snow & rain & I'm positive I could have turned it into a competent first drift car. Parts are easier to find & cheaper for the Mustang than just about anything else. Simple, easy to work on, & just damn effective."
Drifting,30xg5r,Prison_Vape,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"I bought my E36 for $2500 and have had minimal issues with it in the past 1.5 years of drifting.  The main thing is to keep up with maintenance, as I had issues with cooling and the clutch pedal when I first started drifting my car.  Both were fixed with proper fluids and bleeding.  A few other drivers have followed in getting an E36 and have found them for as low as $1200 in the same condition.  It had an awesome wheelbase and good torque when you get a model with an I6.  Like stated in the other comments, miatas are a good cheap car that will be more than enough for smaller tracks and will make you a better driver.  You could also find an older v8 car too that will have decent power but have a slight disadvantage in handling, it really depends on what you like and whether or not you just want to have some fun or progress your skills as quickly as possible."

Everyone has drifted on the street, but there is a time and place for it, in traffic is not that place.      I have a very big rule, if drifting will put others at risk I won't do it.

Drifting,30ny99,NismoPlsr,9,Sun Mar 29 11:12:13 2015 UTC,Rear mounting the radiator keeps it more protected from battle damage. It also puts more weight over the rear wheels while also balancing weight overall.

Drifting,30grbt,cows_opinion,13,Fri Mar 27 11:55:49 2015 UTC,"Um starting with an auto because after 2 minutes of trying you're ""doing every classic stick shift thing wrong"" is the stupidest thing I've heard in a long time. Did you get into a car for the first time and drive like you've been doing it for years? Or did you stall like most other people who first try manual?

Drifting,30grbt,protomor,-1,Fri Mar 27 12:17:54 2015 UTC,"I was being funny. But if you'd like my line of thinking.   As a doctor, if you see a patient that exhibits EVERY symptom of a disease (like glaucoma), they likely are just trying to scam you for meds.   She second statement of ""she should start with auto"" is a general thing since you're the sexist instructor. She sucks at driving. It'd be easier to start her on an automatic. Or at least not a ""race"" car. Like ANY instructor would get into that car and go ""yea, someone can learn to drive on this""  I was really just trying to cram as many funny comments with no logic between statements."

Not too mention who the fuck would learn to drive in something like that haha, the clutch alone would probably be too much if you didn't have any manual experience.

Also a lot of AWD cars tend to be more prone towards understeer rather than over steer when you punch it around a corner. Or so I've been told by random Internet people.
Drifting,30dka4,Teeeeeemu,3,Thu Mar 26 17:43:01 2015 UTC,understeer until you floor it and then comes the oversteer. Thats my experience on 200hp volvo and 170hp skoda in the winter xD

Drifting,30jc8a,creamypies2,3,Fri Mar 27 21:34:49 2015 UTC,I had a trailer and sold it. A bunch of other stuff. There's 2 real reasons behind it. The first one is that you can untag the car and do all the mods you want. The second is the possibility that my car breaks or I crash into something and need a way home.   What made me sell the truck was because it wound up being another money pit. I picked up a cheap truck that could barely tow my car and it needed more love than I could afford.   On the forseburg thing. He had legit cars so missiles are ok. Your only car being a pos isn't a missile. Course that clean missile thing. I don't understand.

Drifting,306i9j,protomor,3,Wed Mar 25 10:22:15 2015 UTC,Im.... ok with this.....   I think fd needs to switch the track circuit up.... add a hp cap.... and generally change completely
Drifting,306i9j,desolatemindspace,11,Wed Mar 25 05:00:42 2015 UTC,HP cap would be rad. The whole sideways dragracing thing is getting old.
Drifting,306i9j,Waffeey,2,Wed Mar 25 05:21:06 2015 UTC,"That would be extremely hard considering the high-tech modern ecu and on-board adjustments the teams have, plus the amount of dyno runs needed to be done for just one FD race would cost money and waste time. How would the officials know the exact hp every car on track is making? The machines that are dominating Formula Drift are doing so because there faster cars, why slow the sport down?"
Drifting,306i9j,Waffeey,2,Wed Mar 25 21:04:49 2015 UTC,Smaller teams struggle to keep up with cars like Chris Forsberg's Z. The bigger teams have huge haulers and a lot of sponsors to keep them going. I don't think it'd have to be too strictly regulated. Maybe a dyno pull at the first tech inspection? I just think it'd make the pack a little tighter...
Drifting,306i9j,TheSteveO,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"It could be done, I just don't know if it'll ever happen but maybe if in the future cost get even tighter they could implement it to tighten up the drifting. I feel as if it's a win=win either way. HP restrictions, tighter tandem battles while helping low cost teams. No restrictions, we get the best unlimited 1000+hp drift machines of dreams."
Drifting,306i9j,Waffeey,2,Wed Mar 25 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"I see multiple things wrong with this argument. Less HP doesn't guarantee tighter tandem battles. That big HP number that gets posted around at the beginning of the season is just the potential of what that setup can do; teams will turn down boost and run a more conservative tune for reliability: the real number is actually lower. A horsepower cap would be too hard to enforce by FD and too hard for the teams to regulate; HP isn't just like a volume knob on a stereo. The constant flow and flux of HP depending on location, weather, engine performance, and a load of other factors would cause chaos within the teams at FD and would likely cause teams to pull out (and no body wants to see that). The issue with low-budget vs. high-budget teams has been the case throughout motorsports for the longest time. With the addition of Pro2, these ""low-budget teams"" (I only put it in quotes because I bet most of y'alls draw would drop if I mentioned how much a ""low-budget team"" spends per season) have the chance to gain pro tandem experience, air time and coverage, and use that to their advantage to gain sponsors for the next season. During a racer marketing course I attended a few years back, the speak said, ""The reward for marketing is racing."" This has been the truth in racing for a long time so don't hold your breath for the HP wars to end."

Drifting,307u1z,Block-Man-X,2,Wed Mar 25 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"I would get one for drifting. It has a really long wheel base, and has a pretty flat torque curve because of the rotary. It is a bit underpowered, and make sure you read up on rotaries. They are very simple and not too hard too maintain if you know how they work. It burns oil by design, and it gets bad mpg. Engine rebuilds are really easy because the RX8s engine only has three moving parts, but you could always swap it for something more powerful once the engine goes out instead. The RX series will take engine swaps really easily. The car is pretty twitchy and you won't get much power out of it without going FI. I think that pretty much covers the basics, you should read up on RX8club for more info. Lots of goods threads there."

Drifting,302vf8,Prison_Vape,8,Tue Mar 24 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well the rotary for the FD is a very reliable way for you to learn how to work on your car. A rotary engine has to be rebuilt approximately every 80k miles. Issues will be vacuum hose, vacuum hose, oil hose, spark plugs, vacuum hose, vacuum hose, nothing except wont start just to piss you off, vacuum hose, vacuum hose, oil hose, ignition system, spark plugs, etc, etc, etc, time to rebuild the engine and lets hope the rotaries and rotary housings are still good, then the fun starts over. And FDs don't really make good drift cars for most people because you have to do lots of upgrades like swapping out the apex seals to a better material, porting the rotary housing, swapping the twin turbo to a larger single turbo, v-mount the radiator and intercooler, lots of chassis bracing and suspension work not to mention they are a very finicky car to drive. And everything for a FD is stupidly overpriced and expensive just because. Hell a set of 4 spark plugs for a 13B rotary is gonna set you back about $80 as you gotta use special spark plugs to which rotary engines foul spark plugs pretty easily and often. For a FD to be a drift car it will have to be purpose built while many people will build a 240 missile car, daily drive it and have no real problems while beating the hell out of it. I can guarantee if you drive a FD to a track you will be trailering it home. With that said as I have a truck with a trailer so I am considering on getting a FD to build as a track car."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,3,Tue Mar 24 02:23:39 2015 UTC,So... stick to a Miata. Got it haha.  It's just... man. I LOVE the way the FD looks!
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,3,Tue Mar 24 02:43:17 2015 UTC,"If I had a Miata I would swap a LS into it. You will screw up the 50/50 weight balance to about a 53/47 weight balance and have much much more power and torque lol. But ya the FD is such a sexy car and as I am looking for a track car project I am debating between a FD or a 510. Iconic or classic, decisions decisions lol."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,2,Tue Mar 24 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"Eh, I figure with a Miata, I'll just keep it basic for a while. Throw on some coil overs, weld the diff, and hoon around in it until I get a feel for the sport. Then I can look into an LS swap, steering angle, slight camber, and an LSD."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,2,Tue Mar 24 03:07:24 2015 UTC,Well if you are still learning there is no better car than a Miata. Hit up your local junkyards and you might be able to find a LSD in good shape. An LS swap in a Miata is a beast of a car lol. Instead of a v8 swap a better mod to do to a Miata once you are ready to move to a different car is an exocet body. http://exomotive.com/exocet/ I have a buddy that just swapped his old Miata into one and its a blast lol. He also kept it registered to which every cop that pulls him over wants a ride in it lol.
Drifting,302vf8,Drift_Pig,2,Tue Mar 24 05:06:00 2015 UTC,"Haha just like a go kart! Those are cool!  But in all honesty, Id rather try cramming a v8 into a tiny car than mess with body stuff. My buddy is the body guy, Im all technical."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,3,Tue Mar 24 05:08:39 2015 UTC,With an exocet you do no body work. You move your suspension subframes and drivetrain to the exocet and scrap your Miata body lol. They also have a v8 exocet now too for those that want a v8 Miata that weighs 35% lighter than a Miata lol. But the exocet swap was a fun project that took just a few weekends to complete.
Drifting,302vf8,THExDANKxKNIGHT,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:16:48 2015 UTC,Can you imagine how fast a Miata running an LS would be 35% lighter? They already weigh nothing.

Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"Why would you put a rotary into a Datsun, that is blasphemy. If I get another 510 I am going SR20DET into it. It fits like a glove and looks perfect under the hood of a 510 and it is more than enough power. If you want a little more you can put a disco potato on it and have more than enough for that little car lol. Also the SR20 swap in a 510 with a fuel cell will keep a perfect 50/50 weight distribution."
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:55:09 2015 UTC,Hahaha I probably should have mentioned that's my drag set up 20b rotary single turbo in a 2100lb 510 I want a miata or 350z for a drifter/daily.
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"Well if its for drag forget about the 510 as its independent rear suspension will make it a shitty drag car. Its independent suspension make them an excellent track car though assuming you are willing to put in the required work. Look for a Datsun 1200 Sunny as that will have a fixed rear axel. An 800hp SR20DET in a Sunny will be in the 8 second range. http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/02/an-8-second-800-whp-datsun-b110/ For a drift car I would suggest the Miata as they are cheap lol,"
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:41:52 2015 UTC,Yea I know more about drifting than I do drag but I want to get more involved with both I've been to track days but never participated
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:07:12 2015 UTC,I actually don't care for drag racing unless its sand drags or ice drags but those types of drags are redneck as shit lol. I prefer track driving and don't tell the LEO but any drifting I do is typically in the canyons as the tracks near me don't allow drifting.
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,3,Tue Mar 24 22:18:28 2015 UTC,Looks great on Initial D and Mad Mike but imagine how less pretty it is with damaged panel ;). Go with the miata or a silvia . Silvia is great platform if you need to stretch out and drop something more powerful in it. The miata can be a short term learning kart for you
Drifting,302vf8,driftsc,2,Tue Mar 24 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"Silvia would be my vote for the OP as it is very cheap to swap engines and while you can swap an LS into a Miata, your engine will be worth more than your car lol. A v8 Miata isn't a practical thing to do unless you already have the know how to do it yourself."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:51:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Hey id like my silvia to be 2jz powered or rb powered, sounds great on paper and thoughts. Still costs an arm and a leg to do in reality. The sr20 will keep for now :) till a popped rocker arm or something ha. To OP , a silvia is a 240sx (s13 or s14) chassis in california"
Drifting,302vf8,driftsc,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"No reason to go with a 2jz in a Silvia as the RB with a tranny is less than 5k. Keep the engine make the same, not to mention the RB is a better engine than the 2jz in my opinion."

Drifting,302vf8,Nigel_Vertigo,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah everyone has a dream to own a 86 just like everyone wants to end up owning a GTR or Ferarri lol. Truenos are great drift cars too. Good platform for swaps, turbo etc. Good weight and balance. However in its stock form with 4age , they are rev happy and in my personal opinion, require more speed to make up for some shortfall in power to drift, much like miatas . But great car to learn in, then transition into track drifting (you'll find this is a huge jump since speeds are higher etc.)"
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:37:12 2015 UTC,Drop in 2jz call it a day
Drifting,302vf8,driftsc,0,Tue Mar 24 09:09:00 2015 UTC,Why even look at an FD? Not to mention a 2jz is so much heavier you have just screwed up the weight balance of the car.
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"FD is made to be a well handling car good weight balance, made for track use, not drifting. Drifting relies on a car with a more forward bias than 50/50"
Drifting,302vf8,driftsc,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"And yet Silvias are said to be some of the best drift cars and they are a near perfect 50/50 weight distribution, not to mention AE86s are a perfect 50/50 weight distribution same goes for the Miata. I wonder why a lot of the most common cars for drifting and cars people say to get first to learn how to drive are near perfect 50/50 weight distributions. Its because a 50/50 weight distribution makes the car predictable and easy to drive. Also the more power you have the more weight you need over the rear of the car which actually take the weight distribution in the opposite direction than an engine swap."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Not S13s. They need more front weight.
Drifting,302vf8,driftsc,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:19:06 2015 UTC,S13 weight distribution is a near perfect weight distribution at a 53/47. Most cars are not a perfect 50/50 as they tend to favor the front or the back.
Drifting,302vf8,Fliparto,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:04:22 2015 UTC,"Silvia are good once you  start modifying  the suspension.  And they have a near 50/50, not 50/50, and in stock  for they understeer . The supra, 300z,fd , miata and s2k are all great road race  cars  because of the 50/50... but drifting is not about being in perfect balance"
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:41:05 2015 UTC,"I never stated Silvias have a 50/50 I said they have a near perfect 50/50 the S13 being the most heavy up front is a 53/47 weight distribution. Drifting is all about control, it is much easier to control a car that is as close to a 50/50 weight distribution as they are more predictable. If heavy front weighted cars are better why don't we see more Volvo 740s as they are around a 70/30 weight distribution? Fact is when people say they like a front heavy car they are talking about a 55/45 weight distribution for drifting which is basically stripping out a car that has a 50/50 weight distribution."
Drifting,302vf8,Fliparto,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"We're  on the same page here. A fd with a jz is a little front heavy, but not enough  to stop it from drifting effectively,  especially when you add that much weight for a roll cage"
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:10:31 2015 UTC,A FD with a jz can be drifted by someone who already has some skill but if they are learning or have little skill I doubt they would be able to control it due to the loss of predictability of the vehicle. A roll cage is going to add minimal weight to the rear while most of the weight will be in the middle of the vehicle. A better option for a FD over a 13b would be a 20b although you really are not doing too much on reliability.
Drifting,302vf8,Fliparto,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"an FD is definitely not  a starter car. I get out of my SC and get into a 13 and feel like a hero.. Drifting the SC from day one has taught me a good deal. In the beginning i was told ""It drives like a skyline, but has the power of a corolla"" when it was non turbo. My friend stepped out of his 13 last week and drifted my car.. I could tell he was struggling, more weight, more power... i think he could get it down if he had more runs."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:49:05 2015 UTC,"I can guarantee you, this is almost 100% wrong. i'd say in the 95% range. rotaries can be very cheap to build, and drift. an engine can be rebuilt and reinstalled in less than a day, using cheap spark plugs, and cheap apex seals. rebuild it once a year and you're golden. biggest thing is to make sure you properly break the engine in."
Drifting,302vf8,Fliparto,0,Tue Mar 24 19:02:37 2015 UTC,"A set of apex seals are gonna run you the same cost as a set of piston rings. Also as when you rebuild an engine you have to check the push rods, pistons, crank, block, etc for damage and to see if it needs to be replaced which is the same in a rotary except it is the rotary housing and rotaries and the eccentric shaft. You state using cheap stuff and rebuilding once a year (15k miles) which actually comes out to more money than buy the quality products and rebuilding at about every 80k miles to which I have heard of people getting over 100k miles. So thank you for verifying that it is very expensive to own and maintain a rotary while clearly showing you know nothing to which you are talking about."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,0,Tue Mar 24 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i was also referring to a drift / race rx-7.   edit: and they are incredibly cheap to run. like i said, to pull the engine apart, soak it, change seals, you're looking at a few hours of work. you're looking at maybe $100 in plugs and seals a year."
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,0,Tue Mar 24 21:39:33 2015 UTC,I don't know what to say except you are a moron and should do some research before you embarrass yourself more than you already have. Here is a link to a cheap ebay rebuild kit for a FD rotary which costs a little over $1500. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mazda-Rx7-Master-Rebuild-Kit-Atkins-Rotary-2MM-Apex-Seals-Rx-7-1993-To-2002-/230703936816?hash=item35b706b530&vxp=mtr A higher quality kit is going to run you $1700-$2000 and if you piece it together to get the best results you are looking at closer to $3000 in parts to rebuild a rotary assuming you don't need to replace any other parts. A properly built rotary engine under hard racing conditions with proper supporting mods should still get at least 50k miles on before needing to be rebuilt. So according to you proper plugs and seals are going to run under $100 dollars a year to rebuild each year so it is quite obvious you have absolutely no clue about wankel engines (rotary engine) and most likely any other type of engine either.
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,0,Tue Mar 24 22:10:35 2015 UTC,Why the hell would you replace every single seal? all you need to replace is the apex and spark plugs. You know nothing of rebuilding rx-7's. please stop commenting and giving people bad advice. thanks
Drifting,302vf8,sifadula,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:43:49 2015 UTC,You do realize in order to get to the apex seals you have to break down the engine which then causes damage to the other seals. Hence the reason you replace the other seals. Not to mention wankel engines are very temperamental when it comes to heat and their requirement for constant oil supply and only way to insure that they get a constant supply of oil is to replace all seals but then again that is why you rebuild your engine after about a year of track days and everyone else is still able to get 50k miles off of their track vehicle before needing to rebuild it and standard driving 80k-120k miles.
Drifting,302vf8,cluggy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"you only need to replace the other seals if the engine is damaged. and like i siad before, you can completely pull the engine apart, soak it, and have it reinstalled withing 24 hours. its pretty much 14 bolts."
Drifting,302vf8,CapitanBanhammer,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"Due to the amount of heat wankel engines generate because they are always in combustion, you will damage the seals when you pull the engine apart also if you don't damage the seals they will be weakened which can cause a oil leak later on which would lead to a catastrophic failure because wankel engines are very heat sensitive due to their design."
Drifting,302vf8,BRGLR,5,Wed Mar 25 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"Start with a 4 stroke. Learn in one of those as you come from a drag background right? Alot of people with circuit experience transition well into drifting. But if you are learning at open skid pans and not track yet, should focus your funds on cheaper maintenance and repairs because as you will know from drag racing... Shit breaks"

Drifting,2zxwik,rapturedjesus,2,Sun Mar 22 21:56:38 2015 UTC,Depends what you do and how much air pressure is in it.  Under normal use (reasonable) stretched or not stretched you are not going to debead a tire.  In aggressive driving under correct tire pressure you will have a hard time debeading a tire.  If you have an accident either way you have a good possibility of debeading.  It has more to do with tire pressure and keeping pressure in the tire then weather or not your tire is stretched. I work in the automotive industry and the only time I have ever seen a car come in with debeaded tire is if the tire lost air pressure first.
Drifting,2zxwik,lazyguyoncouch,2,Sun Mar 22 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"I have done it. I slid into some really soft dirt on some really tall tires with realativley low tire pressure. Still held air afterwards lol. And it was a pretty violent dig in, not like I just skidded over it, it takes force to do this.  Edit: tire was not stretched at all"
Drifting,2zxwik,d3310n,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, paranoia assuaged; your situation ticks every box except for stretching that I can think of that'd make it easier for the tire to get jarred loose; I shouldn't be worried. Thanks.  Actually, if you know, even ballpark, what was the aspect ratio of those tires? How tall is ""tall"" for tires (for drifting, anyway)?"
Drifting,2zxwik,minnion,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:22:20 2015 UTC,I think I know of maybe 5 people who have debeaded stretched tires. And these were REALLY stretched low-pros. A normal tire is nearly impossible to debead if your pressures are correct.

Drifting,2zu0ci,lamchop0199,5,Sun Mar 22 07:19:18 2015 UTC,"Apex seals are like piston rings.  They are designed to hold pressure, in order to compress & ignite. Apex seals start to warp due to the nature of heat from an engine.  As soon as your apex seals stop holding pressure.  You're fucked.  The most common sign is when the engine reaches operating temperature, you turn it off and it struggles to fire up again. Due to the metals expanding."
Drifting,2zu0ci,maybe_skyrim,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:23:33 2015 UTC,"In the video it kind of showed them as being pointless, like they just kind of sit there, such as if I had a piston without the homes for the apex seal it wouldn't make a difference."
Drifting,2zu0ci,lamchop0199,4,Sun Mar 22 07:26:16 2015 UTC,"Apex seals are actually the most important part of a rotary engine.  It is usually the main reason for a rebuild. Basically, apex seals are there to get very very close to the rotor housing, without scraping and causing damage. The closer they are, the more compression. If they are off just a tiny bit, you lose compression."

Drifting,2zpk91,Prison_Vape,10,Fri Mar 20 15:46:41 2015 UTC,1: Get yourself an s13 or an e36. 2: Get spare wheels and mount used tires on them. (At least 3 pairs) 3: Get your rear diff welded. 4: Find a local drift event and party.
Drifting,2zpk91,homeskillet305,3,Fri Mar 20 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, seems straight forward. Now, let me ask. Newbie question, I apologize. Weld the diff?  Could you possibly explain that more? Like weld it shut, or...? Sorry again, that one just lost me."
Drifting,2zpk91,homeskillet305,6,Fri Mar 20 16:02:37 2015 UTC,Weld the spider gears (4 small gears on the inside of the diff) together so that your left and right wheels receive equal amounts of power all the time.
Drifting,2zpk91,HelpDesk7,2,Fri Mar 20 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"Oh! Wow I woulda never thought of that. In the drag world it's posi diff, or go home. Thank you! I'll start looking into it."

Drifting,2zpk91,Griffin-dork,3,Fri Mar 20 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"I dig miatas. Ive raced a few of them on circuit tracks. Little bastards take me on the corners every time, and stick their noses up my tailpipes in the straights. Roller skates on rails! Haha.  I also dig the S13, 14, and 15. So let's say I find one and pull the trigger on it. What kind of modifications would I want to look into? All I know about suspension mods are small lowers using static coil overs to lower my center of gravity. Again, Ive been a drag guy all my life. Is camber a thing here?   Also, what do you make of the Trueno? Heard those make good drift cars."
Drifting,2zpk91,kraftythings,4,Fri Mar 20 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"a lot of the suggestions here list way more than you really need. You could drift your mustang (assuming its not a full blown drag car) if you wanted. The ONLY things you need to drift are a RWD car with a manual transmission and some sort of locking rear diff. Most guys prefer welded, meaning they take a normal open diff and weld the spider gears together to make it a locked axle 100% of the time.   As for a decent beginner setup? I would say everything I listed above and a decent set of stiff suspension (struts and springs), probably a decent set of aftermarket coilovers that you can get for ~$1k. Thats it. Just that and get out there and have a blast.   As for technique, this is a good learning tool:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPQyQgyuNMI  Just get out on a track (dont street drift, that shits stupid and dangerous) and have a blast. You will suck for a while but just dont worry about it and have fun doing it. Its like riding a bike. No one can explain to you and then you can just go do it. You can read how to and have people explain it but until you get the seat time to figure it out for yourself, you just wont be able to."
Drifting,2zpk91,willfill,2,Fri Mar 20 19:36:04 2015 UTC,"This is very helpful, Thank you! It is a relief to learn drifting isn't as expensive to get into as dragging is."
Drifting,2zpk91,ChadHardcastle,3,Fri Mar 20 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"Not a problem at all. Drifting is actually the cheapest motorsport to get into. You can make it very affordable. I actually just calculated my costs the other day and per event, I spend about $150, with food, gas, event fee, everything for the whole day. I drive my car to the track and home, take used tires from a shop I used to work at and a local dealership that fit on the spare wheels I have, and just have a blast.  A drift car doesnt have to be much. I have an S13 240sx hatchback and the stock motor only has 155hp and I drift just fine. If you find yourself lacking the power, just inflate your rear tires more. Most events I run 50-60psi in my rear tires. As for tires, for a basic drift car what tires you run really dont matter much. Something somewhat performance oriented in the front would help, the rear can be whatever you dig out of the used pile. It really doesnt matter haha."
Drifting,2zpk91,Pergatory,3,Fri Mar 20 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"Slight camber in the front for added traction when your car is flying sideways, some people drift with crazy camber but they also go through crazy tires  Also, LSD or welded diffs are vital to drifting"
Drifting,2zpk91,sifadula,2,Fri Mar 20 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"Trueno at this point is rather rare and expensive for what you get, but they are decent if you can find one for a good price."
Drifting,2zpk91,sifadula,2,Fri Mar 20 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Essentially for any drift car you are going to want coilovers, decent breaks, and in some cases an angle kit (modified or custom steering knuckles etc). Also ensure the tranny is manual. Another big point is ensuring you have a LSD or welded differential.   I personally have a Miata that is heavily modified (Had an SR20 swapped into it, modified knuckles, coilovers, widebody kit etc.Z)  The Trueno is a great drift car. What it lacks is power in its stock for, just like a stock miata. Keep in mind it has a smaller wheelbase as well so it will take a bit more skill to drift a Trueno than a Silvia."
Drifting,2zpk91,Shinny1337,2,Fri Mar 20 18:21:07 2015 UTC,Perfect! I'll start doing more homework on it.
Drifting,2zpk91,Shinny1337,3,Fri Mar 20 18:32:04 2015 UTC,"What cars could I look into for potentially building a drift car?  What does a drift set up require?   Rear wheel drive and an LSD or welded diff. That's literally all there is to it, you can drift in a big boat of a 4-door car if you want! In fact, starting in an underpowered car is a great way to force yourself to learn more refined techniques. If you start in too powerful of a car, you can fall into the trap of relying on its torque to kick the car sideways, which isn't terrible, but will be obvious to other drifters. Drifting is about finesse, not power.   What are some techniques I could teach myself to pull off a relatively safe, but impressive drift?   I highly recommend the Drift Bible which can be found around YouTube and such. It will teach you various techniques for initiating a drift. Once you get the car sideways there aren't many variations in technique it's just about riding the knife's edge. There are, however, many different ways to initiate a drift and some are more difficult than others."
Drifting,2zpk91,Shinny1337,2,Fri Mar 20 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Great info, Thank you!!  I checked out Drift Bible. That Keiji guy is INCREDIBLE!"
Drifting,2zpk91,sr20inans2000,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry can I add, theres nothing wrong with starting in a more 'powerful' car. It might be easier to learn in. The biggest thing when I started drifting was knowing when the rear broke loose then actually carrying the car in a direction with the gas and steering. while above is true that you can start to 'rely' on it and 'other' drifters knowing this.. I think is a cop out, drifting is a subjective sport but you arent going to compete. Dont worry what others think, its about having fun while learning.. If more power is easier to learn in then go for it. Grassroot days should be about bringing whatever and just having a hoon. Ive never been to a drift event where it feels like people dog on you for failing or laugh. Drifters are a bunch of great folk in their environment."

Just get in my car, find some empty space and have fun. If I have fun, I will learn to feel how my car behaves, and won't be afraid of my tail slide. Which, in my opinion, should be elementary for drifters."
Drifting,2zpk91,gillbilly72,3,Tue Mar 24 01:08:03 2015 UTC,If your mustang is a GT you're fine. There was one at our last event with a newbie and I taught him to connect the entire course. I drifted a stock 95 convertible for a year and a half before the S14 I bought came up for sale. You've got a V8 and an LSD that covers 90% of what you need to drift. You won't have crazy steering angle but you'll be fine starting out without it. http://dvanzstore.bigcartel.com/category/front-suspension makes fully adjustable drift suspension for mustangs. They're pricier than the stuff for 240's but if you get serious they'll do the job. Just get out and drive in events. Your biggest problem will be the driver not the car for a long while.
Drifting,2zpk91,gillbilly72,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"Ah a fellow Mustang guy! My Mustang is actually a v6, but Ive been told an under powered car is better to learn techniques, such as side, clutch lock, lift off etc (Ive been watching Drift Bible) rather than relying on power to break the rear end loose.  Id actually like to purchase a second car, as the Mustang is getting a different build. (V6 turbo sleeper) for highway pulls and drag racing. No diff welds on my baby haha"
Drifting,2zpk91,Painkiller3666,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:07:40 2015 UTC,Yeah the v6 isn't the best and underpowered is ok when the car is light but the Mustangs are too heavy. Also never weld a mustang diff the car is heavy enough it'll snap the axles. I'd look at a Miata as the others have said. Check out the 8-bit miata the guy drifted a stock NA with a welded diff for quite some time even in competitions.
Drifting,2zpk91,Painkiller3666,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never thought a Mustang would be ideal for drifting, unless you happen to be Vaughn Glitten Jr.  Im looking at Miatas, S14s and e36s.   I kinda want an MR2 turbo. How do you think a mid engine car would do? Probably not ideal, since it isn't RWD I expect."
Drifting,2zpk91,minnion,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:44:56 2015 UTC,It is RWD but the weight balance is off and I don't think there's any drifting support for Mid engine cars.
Drifting,2zpk91,minnion,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Well then it looks like Ive got three options! Probably will be a while till I can get one, but I figure I can practice when it's wet in the Mustang, since it's under powered, RWD, and a stick shift."
Drifting,2zpk91,minnion,3,Fri Mar 20 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"Weld your diff, get the e brake working right.  Then: coils and arms/suspension mods  Then: knuckles and more power, swaps turbos ect.  Start doing really controlled doughnuts. When you get that make them bigger and bigger. After that go drift shit and fuck up til you learn."
Drifting,2zpk91,Chris_nuisance,2,Fri Mar 20 19:19:34 2015 UTC,Rx7s and miatas are ok. But I would recommend s13 or s14 for a starter and parts are cheap I believe. Focus on suspension (coilovers are a good start)  and steering angle before you focus on power.  I started with clutch kicks and ebrake drifts in the rain with my low powered rx7.
Drifting,2zpk91,Chris_nuisance,2,Fri Mar 20 16:41:02 2015 UTC,Silvias are expensive in Southern California (unless not all S13/14s are Silvias....). What kind of steering angles are ideal and how would I modify a stock steering angle? We don't fiddle with all that in the drag community.

A swap that requires some fab work on the subframe would be to do a z33/34 swap, which has a few options for gearing and several aftermarket LSDs available. Another plus side to going z33 is that you can then use the z32tt/q45 axles and hubs which are all stronger and have higher spline counts.  You can search around for writups on all of these."

Drifting,2zljez,protomor,5,Thu Mar 19 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree on a few things.  As a former 135i owner, these things are the definition of cookie cutter.  I don't think there has been a single thoroughly unique one built yet.  Except for maybe the guy that built the turbo s54 race car, but that's a completely different story.  The electronic throttle seemed very lazy.  You could probably adapt to the delay in the electronic throttle, or maybe cure it if COBB can access the factory throttle curves.  The piggyback tuning options ruined the driveability of the car in my opinion.  Their approach to ""increased throttle response"" was to just make an abrupt exponential ramp up in the factory throttle curve, so there was very little modulation.  I also found that the hp/torque increase promise the major tuners make are wishful thinking at best.  They may have been able to do it for one gear on a dyno in ideal conditions, but in real world conditions mine always pulled out tons of boost and timing due to heat soak from the turbo being pushed passed its efficiency zone.   I think the chassis itself has a lot of potential.  Mine drove really nicely, the weight transfer and steering felt great on it.  Very direct steering, the car was very predictable.  Also they are becoming significantly cheaper.  If you don't mind rebuilding the turbos on an n54 they can be had for half of the price of a toyobaru.  And if you buy one with good turbos that havent been replaced yet, you will have to replace them anyways with the n54.  Just a FYI, they are open diff from the factory, and on the automatic cars and i think maybe some manual, the ring gear is welded to the differential unit."

There’s not going to be many FRS/BRZs at grassroot events yet since it’s still a fairly new car. There are plenty of them being drifted professionally before Ryan Tuerck went with that platform Dai was using it last season. It is a great car, and over time I’m sure it will become more common in lower levels of drifting, but even now you only ever see like 2 MAYBE 3 350z’s at any given amateur drift even, and these cars cost a fraction of what a BRZ costs right now."
Drifting,2ziquh,kurowuro,4,Wed Mar 18 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"You must not go to any good drift series. Here in Texas we had 5 350Zs competing and more driving for fun. There were a few FRS at each event. Lone Star Drift. Look it up.   Ryan Tuerck had an FRS longer than Dai. In fact a whole season longer than Dai. Not to mention Angelo, Gushi, Up Garage (D1GP), and more.   Maybe you don't understand the drifting scene."
Drifting,2ziquh,caglej6666,3,Thu Mar 19 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"I started drifting with Aaron in those guys in Texas at mineral wells probably about a decade ago now so needless to say I'm fully aware of the scene down there. Just because there is ONE venue that has less than 10 high end cars doesn't make that the norm (there are always exceptions to generalizations.) Last time I was at mineral wells there were 3-4 ferarris, and an old F150 pick up running on methanol. Does that mean that those are common grassroot drifting builds? No.  You're right I was mistaken that Dai didn't go FRS first, but still my point stands that the FRS in grassroots drifting is still too new/expensive to be the norm."
Drifting,2ziquh,kurowuro,2,Thu Mar 19 04:24:21 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean with it being mostly young adults and how you elaborated, but I didn't really mean people buying it only for drifting or buying it to seriously get into drifring. I mean people buying the car and trying drifting a few times for fun because it can. I would assume some people would regularly drift alone and record it with something like a single go pro mounted inside or outside. I didn't necessarily mean people getting the car to get into drifting all the time. I also assumed since it's a pretty popular car, some people would learn that it can drift well and they start liking it, so maybe they eventually attend a couple amateur events, but I would expect mostly it would be people doing some drifting alone for fun somewhere secluded or something. Sorry for the lack of clarity."

I can't afford a car over a few thousand right now, but for fun I've been looking at used cars like an S14 for example, and the only clean ones I find are as expensive as a new FRS, like $20k+. I've been able to find some cheap models, but they definitely would need a full paint job, they're slammed, plastic broken body kits, need full interior cleaning or upholstery, I would need higher springs, and then all the other little things add up.

In reality, I wont be taking people around much and even so, I wouldn't want to, so I guess I can get over that issue.   Also, would a stock miata really be able to easily drift and get angle on dry pavement? A lot of what I see is it just sliding a bit around corners and it looks tough to get it to even do that without spinning out."

But yeah a stock miata in good condition can get sideways pretty easily, though the shorter wheelbase and low power will make serious angle pretty difficult to maintain, but that doesn't matter for a first car. Just get out in a clear area feint right, and hard left with a clutch kick. Repeat until you don't suck too much. If you want to haul more people get an e30.

Good luck finding a stock 5speed 240. Miata is seriously the only thing you can really get that fits all your criteria. I was the same way with the seats thing, but then a month went by with my miata and I'm fine with not being able to drive a ton of people. Your friends also have cars, and it's not like you can't drive your parents cars ever again if you wanna go cruise with friends. I went from a really nice and clean forester to my miata, never would go back. And you'll learn PLENTY fast with miatas on how to work on engines. I've probably tripled my knowledge of cars in general since last august just by having to fix things on my 91 and what I have for plans in the future. Join facebook groups, like miata, drifters, 240sx, bmw, toyota, etc for your region, groups are typically really helpful and you can find sweet deals. I bought some wheels from a honda group and a bunch of other stuff all from the different groups I'm in.  For reference on age, I'm 17 and this is my first real experience with working on cars.

Drifting,2zjb9c,counterfeitpoop,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:23:11 2015 UTC,Might also consider a fox body or SN95 Gt mustang. But yeah Miata would be best. Also check out autocross. You can get sideways in corners of you want and the SCCA usually has good groups of people. Would be a good starting point and much easier on the car.
Drifting,2zgnp7,googzmo,5,Wed Mar 18 12:56:52 2015 UTC,If you're going to drift it you are probably better off welding it. I'm not sure why you said you would prefer not to but there is a lot of misconception about welded diffs. I daily drove a 240 with a welded for about a year and had no issues.
Drifting,2zgnp7,Griffin-dork,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:10:01 2015 UTC,"Noob question, what is the misconception about welded diffs?    I don't actually drift, or plan to, but drifting interests me."
Drifting,2zgnp7,Shorewahtevs,7,Wed Mar 18 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"That they're hard to handle on the street, mainly. And, they are. If you're careless. I daily'd my S13 with welded diff and it was a learning curve for sure, but it wasn't terrible. After the first week I was fine. Because there's absolutely NO ""slip"" like there is with a LSD (limited slip differential), you'll have a lot of noise in low speed, tight, turns and the car is pretty prone to oversteer on wider/faster turns. Just don't lift the throttle abruptly, and be careful when its wet, and it's not a big deal. I did go through tires on that car faster than any vehicle I've owned, but that was probably a combo of the welded diff and the constant hooning."
Drifting,2zgnp7,mchandleraz,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:16:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!
Drifting,2zgnp7,Shorewahtevs,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:18:42 2015 UTC,I would say the same thing pretty much. Just be a bit more careful when its wet/icy out and dont drive like and idiot on the street and you wont have to worry about it. Only other nuisance was the tire chirping at low speed tight turns like in gas stations. As for tire wear I hardly noticed a difference but I also ran hire treadwear tires on the street.
Drifting,2zgnp7,Griffin-dork,2,Wed Mar 18 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"Only other nuisance was the tire chirping at low speed tight turns like in gas stations.   Oh gawd.  I was with a friend on our lunch break a few years back and we stopped for gas. He had an S14 with 20s (I know it sounds awful, but for a street car it actually looked great), and a welded diff. The tight turns in the gas station parking lot got a LOT of attention. One woman seemed to be certain that this death trap was about to explode. Between the diff clunking, the tires squealing and rubbing, and the lopey idle from his big cam we were quite the sight."
Drifting,2zgnp7,mchandleraz,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"hahahaha, yeah, you will have that from time to time. The chirp wasnt bad on my tires, but I was running continental conti-pro-contact runflats which have a pretty high wear rating so they usually didnt chirp much, just a scrubbing noise. My car is just an S13 hatch with a KA in it that is straight piped. Every suspension piece has been done under the car pretty much though. I rarely drive it on the street much. Its torn apart now for maintenance but in a couple weeks once its back together I think Im going to have to drive it to work a couple times. My coworkers would get a kick out of that lol."
Drifting,2zgnp7,Griffin-dork,0,Wed Mar 18 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"Just don't lift the throttle abruptly   Just curious as to why this would affect a welded diff, on an LSD lifting causes the diff to open which has obvious serious consequences.   With a welded diff it doesn't seem like this would be an issue. Does a welded diff increase the risk of lift off oversteer?"
Drifting,2zgnp7,downvotes_work,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"I actually had the opposite experience with my car. Its the only welded diff I've driven more than a mile or so, and the only one I ever pushed hard, so it may have been something else about my setup but I got understeer when I'd lift the throttle on my S13 w/ welded diff."
Drifting,2zgnp7,mchandleraz,2,Wed Mar 18 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"Lots of people think that they are dangerous and will make you wreck or spin out abruptly for no reason or even randomly break/blowup. Then theres people saying it wears tires like crazy too.   I daily'd a welded for about a year and as long as you are aware of what it is and dont drive a complete idiot on the street, you wont suffer any negatives really. You do have to be a little more aware when its really wet (with good tires this isnt really and issue) and in really slippery conditions such as ice or snow it will cause you to understeer easier than before, but again, as long as you are aware of it, its not an issue. As for tire wear, it definitely affects it slightly, but I hardly noticed at all. As for the break/blow up concern, as long as the diff is properly welded it will be extremely strong and you will have nothing to worry about.  One more thing I will add is I much prefer a welded over a 2 way diff or LSD. I have an LSD in my miata and have driven quite a few cars (drift cars) with 2 ways in them, and I just cant get away from the 100% consistency with my welded. Its also FREE if you weld it yourself. Or if you dont pay someone $50 to do it for you the right way. If you drive your car in the snow the consistency helps a lot."
Drifting,2zgnp7,Griffin-dork,2,Wed Mar 18 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"Ahh, okay. Thanks!"
Drifting,2zgnp7,Shorewahtevs,2,Wed Mar 18 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"No problem. For the record there isnt anything wrong with wanting an LSD or 2 way either, its all personal preference and whether you are willing to pay the price. Lots of people are heavily biased so most wont give you straight info."
Drifting,2zgnp7,Griffin-dork,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:24:36 2015 UTC,You can put a stock G80 in it but it breaks easily. You can also put a stock LSD from a 240/740/940 but the cross shafts break easily too. Welding the diff will result in broken half shaft ends.

Drifting,2zcevf,driftsc,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, but amount of camber in the picture seems ridiculous. Race cars with slicks can use up to -5 degree and even  then you can barely see wheel is tilted at all."

Drifting,2zcevf,driftsc,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"Uh... this is wrong. As you turn into a corner your wheels will gain positive camber, increasing the contact patch."

It's not about normal grassroots cars it's for teams with style.  I'm sorry if you feel differently but that's what it's about."
Drifting,2z3vn3,Thelegassy,2,Mon Mar 16 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"they looked like pretty normal grassroots cars to me, except animal style and proceed  also looked into the rules, did not know there is litterally a car show which contributes to 50% of the points for a team  so my bad, did not know that acesitcs and having wheels more expensive than the car was important  kinda makes me hate final bout and makes me think I wanna go to parc bash instead, at least I can drive at parc bash without being hated on"

It's like 3 turns It's a bank to the right, a decreasing radius left with a long run in, and a tight right out.  If you wanna compete, good for you, go evergreen. But if you're like me. And only drift for fun, it's not really a track in my mind worth going to when pats acres or Spokane county raceway exists."

Drifting,2yrbf1,eLetoR,3,Sun Mar 15 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"in Australia we have ADGP which is basically Australian Formula D and many other events that cater to that style. However we also have a movement that moves away from Formula D style of drift that encourages close driving not fast driving.   This means that events have cheap tire regulations and run layouts/tracks that suit low powered cars and judges that allow for the low powered cars. Nationally we have DCA events and state based Stadium Drift events that cater to this movement.   When that movement came we had several ADGP drivers drop out and joined that cheaper more aggressive styled movement. The funny thing is that everyone likes one style and hates the other, so there is a ton of infighting with those in DCA saying ADGP is all about the engine not the driver and the cost is meaning only those with bags of money can play while ADGP pokes fun at the some of the more missile spec cars saying they are shitboxs and it will never get the sponsors.  I compete in Stadiums and DCA when its close by because I am a Uni student but i also prefer the driving if your wondering, though i stay away from the infighting."

Drifting,2yrbf1,thetimechaser,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"West central FL here, not that bad. OSW holds events regularly ($65 to drive I think, $12 to watch) with decent turnout and alright driving, and it's only an hour from me. Lots of ""ratchet40s"" and generally not the best looking cars but every state has those.  West Palm Beach holds events a couple times a year I think, but I don't know too much about that, and there's a small track/compound around there that people like to spend a day at, couple turns, not really a track, but not really the street either. Three Palms Drift has looked really solid, but I haven't been to an event yet. As far as stuff in the same county as me, it's really just beat up 240/350s doing donuts and powerslides in empty parking lots. All in all I think Florida's doing alright, but is still a few years behind socal/east coast/chicago/pnw in terms of good looking cars and good drivers."

Lost Bremerton Motorsports Park and Pacific Grand Prix (kart track) in the last few years.   Right now we have Pacific once a year invite only at best, South Sound Speedway which is pretty far away for most considering its an oval, and Evergreen which is pretty much an oval as well, although layouts are actually getting a lot better.   IMO peak here was 2009-11. Style / build wise cars have gone waaaaay down hill. With the loss of more technical tracks older guys have kinda shrugged and don't make it out to EVD as much. The best we have is PARC the kart track down in Oregon but that's kind of a hike.    Prospects are hopeful though. The Ridge Motorsports Park just opened and may warm up to drifting, also Bremerton apparently will be rebuilding a full auto-sports complex (previously an old airport lol).  I stopped drifting for awhile in 2010 so I missed a lot of good stuff but I'm back now and hopeful. Hopefully with new tracks in a couple years older guys will come back and build car quality will increase.   Edit: all in all, its fine, I'm just a crusty old fuck who wishes the cars were still pretty, oh well trends come and go.

A typical ProAm weekend's cost is outlined below  Tires - $900 Entry - $250 Gas (truck and race car) - $300 Food - $50 Hotel - None, sleep in the truck  Overall just the weekend costs $1500.

Drifting,2yl099,gillbilly72,12,Wed Mar 11 04:31:51 2015 UTC,"I am your average grassroots drifter. S13 hatch, Dual cam KA that is completely stock, welded diff, and your usual ISIS brand coilovers and adjustable arms.   The original car cost me $700, It needed a new head so I did that, which cost only about $100 in parts since I had a spare head laying around that had already been to the machine shop. Then the cost of the suspension bits and some cheap 17"" wheels from craigslist. So I really dont have too much into the car, especially for a drift ready car.   As for regular costs. Usually drift twice a month, every other sunday. I drive my car to the track and back and its usually a 2 hour drive. So I probably spend $35-40 in gas getting there, drifting, and driving home. I change my oil every few events, but mine burns some oil so I probably add a quart per event. I run free tires that I steal from the scrap pile at a local dealership. The entry fee for the events is $85.   So really a regular one day Sunday Drift event only costs me $150 or so, with event cost, gas, oil, food, and any other small expenditures for the day, which is fantastic."

I also will be significantly increasing my tire budget since I'm moving on up to something with a little more power.  For my backup car I change the oil once or twice a season, put some gas in it, and change the tires every 2 events (around $200 a pair).  I think I went through 6 or 8 sets of tires last season in it.  That is with a stock KA.  I think the most expensive part of last season was the hotels, gas for the truck to tow it up to events, entry fees, bar tabs, food, strippers, etc...  TLDR;  Its too depressing to actually add it up.  I just spend whatever I need to and have a damn good time doing it."

Networking is absolutely essential when it comes to ballin on a budget. I would have to say almost all or my money went into tires. Especially fronts. We had made our own angle kit and were able to achieve 65 degrees of lock on a negative Ackerman setup so eating up 200 wear tires was a common practice.  Race gas doesn't come cheap either, at nearly 9 bucks a gallon for 110, its not exactly the best budget cutter.  Best part is, I got to drift almost 30 events being homeless and bouncing around. I really wanted to be a pro driver but if you dont have 70k or more to spend a year, you're not even ready to step into pro 2 as some of the cars in pro am are pushing 800 wheel with wise fab.

Though I'm still heavily involved in the sport by announcing, assisting with events, and/or hanging out which by paying for gas/food/hotels adds up to an expensive weekend by my meager means. If I announce or help out with the events, sometimes I'll be compensated, but that just barely balances the budget. I debated on posting this, but for those reading who are worried about spending so much to drift; just keep in mind it's a sport based around passion, there are ton of things to do within the sport that doesn't cost the thousands of dollars which a driver would spend."
Drifting,2yl099,minnion,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"This is true, but also remember, you dont have to spend thousands every season. If you look at my post above, I have very little in my car. initial car plus what it cost to get it running and driving, only about $1000. Then i have maybe $1500 in suspension bits. Thats really about it. Then every event only costs me about $150 in total for the day. Largest contributing factor is I only have a stock KA, so I go through hardly any tires at all. two sets will usually last me the day. Ill bring a third if I think Ill need them but thats only if there is really low attendance and I basically get to hot lap the track. The tires I do use are from a local dealership. I just take them and they turn a blind eye because its saving them money haha. Ill take any 17s or 15s I can. I do get a LOT of 225/45/17s that have a high treadwear rating so that makes them last a good bit as well.  This all adds up to making the sport cost very little for me and I get to have a shit ton of fun."
Drifting,2yhq8g,StormyBA,12,Mon Mar 9 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"Low budget or daily drivers you can drift easily at about 20mph on a short course (easier to lose grip on a wet surface ofcourse). This can all depend on the car. I've had a few hours of seat time drifting near standard mx-5 mk2's and was comfortably doing 30mph hand brake entries on a damp surface (managed 34-35mph on the odd occasion). (LSD installed)  Further up in the drifting world you have people easily pushing 60/70mph around faster corners and then complete loonies doing 90mph+ handbrake entries.   Pro cars are like you say more horsepower, lighter and more grip. More grip means you can put down more power and get you going faster around the corners sideways. Other mods for the more serious competitors can include a full reshuffle of the steering links and chassis to allow more steering angle (allows for those tasty angles).  Or simple aftermarket parts such as hub knuckles that can allow for more angle without the whole hassle of cutting/welding of other parts.  When you get a chance, check out Driftwork.com forums. You can read what people are doing to their setups to get an idea as to what goes on. Hopefully, some of what I've written gives you an idea, I'm sure there are more experienced people here who can go more indepth about other areas. Main thing to remember is, you don't need a fully modified car to drift, just an engine, rwd and somewhere to get sideways (legally)."
Drifting,2yhq8g,IntrepidAnt,2,Mon Mar 9 22:51:30 2015 UTC,What would you say are the key aspects of a pro car over an amateur? I'm guessing you get around the track faster but what else. Say you buy some BMW m3 off a scarp heap and then spend 20k pimping it up. Where would you see the biggest changes?
Drifting,2yhq8g,halycon8,6,Mon Mar 9 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"increased steering angle, stiffer suspension and chassis and more power are the most common things done to make cars drift better.  That's the vague answer anyway."
Drifting,2yhq8g,mowbuss,3,Mon Mar 9 23:41:52 2015 UTC,Its not just stiffer suspension that makes a better car. Its improved suspension tailored to suit the needs of the driver. Stiff suspension in general equates to a lot less grip. And the top level comp is chasing speed because for some reason speed is a judging factor.
Drifting,2yhq8g,halycon8,3,Tue Mar 10 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"I'm talking stiffer suspension from stock which in most drift cars will improve your ability to drift.  Find me one single drift build where they softened the suspension.  Obviously people are going to have different preferences but like I said, I was just giving a vague answer.  In almost every drift build, the suspension and chassis are stiffened, body roll is no good in a drift car."

Drifting,2yhq8g,JockThatCamel,2,Tue Mar 10 05:18:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say people in FD have little skill. I dislike the whole horsepower war going on in the event and the judging can be pretty crap sometimes, but the drivers themselves definitely have skill."
Drifting,2yhq8g,BRGLR,3,Tue Mar 10 08:17:51 2015 UTC,Too many of the drivers in FD rely on power and not actual skill where all the Japanese drivers have actually learned on under powered cars. Learning on under powered cars gives you a better mastery of all the skills used in drifting so you don't have to rely on power. Fact of the matter is in Japan the track kids with the half destroyed cars would actually be able to compete with the FD drivers and they are still learning compared to the rest of the talent that is at the top of their drifting scene. If you watch this video it can give you a little bit of insight into just how much better Japan's drifting scene is compared to everyone else. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZjpFYlYdw8
Drifting,2yhq8g,JockThatCamel,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"I know how good the Japanese scene is in regards of D1GP/SL, such a different experience. I think the older players in FD did learn on lower horsepower cars; They've been around for sometime. The newer guys in FD that haven't been drifting for very long probably did start when the horsepower wars were beginning and are relying on power to get them through. I will still say they have skill though, just because you rely on power doesn't mean anyone else can jump right in and do the same thing."
Drifting,2yhq8g,BRGLR,2,Tue Mar 10 09:10:22 2015 UTC,Even the older contenders of FD have a very hard time drifting an under powered car. FD has always had cars with higher power and torque but now it is just getting out of hand. As far as skill the only thing they have really mastered is throttle control and e-brake. The biggest problem with learning on cars with higher power and torque is you learn a lot of bad habits that are very hard to break. When drifting an under powered car you have to be very precise and direct with everything.

Drifting,2yhq8g,operationcougar,2,Tue Mar 10 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"Correct suspension,  I agree. And it's solely based upon preference, in fact on my e36 I do not run a rear away bar. The springs are stiff enough that body roll isn't a concern. I feel much more planted and in control with the independent articulation in the back. I've ran a few events without a front sway as well, however I'm not making huge power so I don't think my front end gets ""loose"" enough to notice the change."

Drifting,2yhq8g,mowbuss,1 point,Tue Mar 10 19:12:37 2015 UTC,In my previously stocko s13 with no coilovers and bad suspension i wasnt comfortable entering faster then 120 kmph. Ive street drifter in that thing in 3rd gear before though  lol.
Drifting,2yhq8g,IntrepidAnt,2,Tue Mar 10 02:10:40 2015 UTC,I've heard they handle like boats with stock suspension. Would still love to have one in the future. I believe the mx5's i drifted had aftermarket suspension as well. Just remembered they were a bit lower than a stock one (I have a mk2 mx5).  I imagine rainy days were fun in your s13 :>

Drifting,2yhq8g,dapperfiziks,3,Tue Mar 10 20:40:48 2015 UTC,"Any rwd car can do an entry at any mph it is capable of reaching. Here's Forsberg doing a 100+mph entry with a shitty missle car.  http://youtu.be/cKRMmkQC0sw  'pro' cars are just purpose built for the specific championship they are competing in, as different organizers have different rules. Theres not one 'thing' that makes a car pro vs. amateur level.  The only thing that makes them pro is everything is typically top of the line as far as drivetrain, safety, suspension, etc. They only have high HP (+/- 1000HP) to be able to literally keep up with the competition.  Also, speed does not make a course 'harder', some of the low speed courses and high to low speed transitions can make it really technical and tricky for the drivers.  As far as what makes a drift car, the basic components are rear wheel drive, locking differential, manual transmission, aaand thats pretty much all you 'need'."
Drifting,2yhq8g,BRGLR,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:41:32 2015 UTC,Intresting.. Is there a minimum speed to get drifting? I read about 5/6 techniques to kick the back end out and got the impression different techniques worked with different powered cars.   So say there was 5-10 bits of a car you could upgrade to get it drifting better what would you choose?
Drifting,2yhq8g,MichaelTreadgold,3,Mon Mar 9 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"No minimum speed to get into a drift. With proper foot work you can pull a drift at any speed in dry conditions without using the e-brake even in low powered cars like a Miata. High horsepower is just for burning tires to build smoke which is all for show. Well the first things to upgrade is your ability to proficiently do all of these: power over, clutch kick, e-brake, shift lock, long slide, braking, feint, lift off, jump, dirt drop. Then you can look into upgrading your actual car while working on become more proficient at swaying. With out those skills you will just rely on the power of the vehicle and be a clown in the grand scheme of things. If you cant proficiently drift a stock Miata you really should continue to work on your driving skills more before upgrading parts on your car."
Drifting,2yhq8g,tomwankshoody,2,Tue Mar 10 05:32:27 2015 UTC,Lock the differential. Harder springs and shocks. Increase steering lock. Wider/lower profile tires for more grip. Move steering rack backwards to allow steering to float back to centre more easily and increase steering feedback. Add power and reduce turbo lag.   I should add that a good secure seat and harness are essential otherwise you won't be able to hold on!   Then it's just practice and fine tuning everything for your style/track.  RB forever.
Drifting,2yhq8g,MichaelTreadgold,0,Tue Mar 10 08:14:35 2015 UTC,wat.... you've obviously never drifted
Drifting,2yhq8g,Arctic_Ranger,2,Wed Mar 11 03:50:33 2015 UTC,I'm curious what your list is then. I'm far from being a pro drifter. My ride is a standard rb25det r33.

I mostly used second gear and occasionally dabbled in third. I'm a good enough driver to know that I'm not very good. I just drift for shits and giggles.   The best drift car is the one with LSD, racing seat, and coil overs, that you can afford to rebuild every week.

Suspension wise i have coilovers and adjustable arms. No hydo, no roll cage, just stock rear brakes with project mu pads. 235 45 17 tyres front and rear.  On our big entry layout of the track ive driven, ive entered at speeds of 140-150 kmph. Thats driving flat out, then throwing the car into the corner with a shitty attempt at a feint. We have speeds of approx 170 kmph on another track that people reach commonly. Again. This is throwing the car into the corner.  I dont consider what i see in formula drift as true drifting. To me, its a sustained burnout with another car cross drag race.   Drifting here isnt about racing, its about proximity, and that creates fairer and better competition and more exciting competition, where the guy with the most HP doesnt win by default."

You can really drift at any speed you're comfortable with.  More powerful cars with more angle will be able to keep their speed much better however, and in practical situations (on a tight course) they can accelerate faster so they'll have quicker entry speeds.    What makes a pro car ""pro"" is really just the driver.  More power, more angle and better suspension all help, but this isn't like nascar or F1 etc where there are specific requirements for the car.  If you want to know how to start making your car go sideways, just pull the handbrake/kick the clutch on a rainy/snowy parking lot."
Drifting,2yhq8g,adamthebeast,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:38:30 2015 UTC,Ok guys so I am going to show you the track I learned how to drift on back in 2003  http://youtu.be/qVfQMFWJlZk?t=12s  You enter the sweeper at about 120mph  you clutch kick and ride the sweeper maxxed out ebrake into the s and down shift into 3rd and ride it all the way out of the judged section.   Also it is the fastest drifted corner in the world you can also enter it at 140mph with the correct set up car.

I imagine if you wanted to you could make the car pretty light without all of the luxuries.  I mean it defeats the purpose of buying a BMW, but I think you could go pretty far with weight reduction on it, but still keep some of the things that make it nice inside.

My friends 06' has some gear grinding issues at 90K, but that's a known issue for that year (and its the original trans). Any transmission stamped CD009 should be fine, its just 04' was the year actually released with the least issues. Many cars have been serviced by Nissan and swapped out to CD009 for other years up to 06'. Really any transmission that is stamped CD009 out of an 03'-06' should work just fine."

Drifting,2xuhs7,thetimechaser,4,Tue Mar 3 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"The Drift Muscle is a series created after Tsuchiya left D1.  Its purpose is to bring a series which appeals more to the roots of Drift rather then the over the top endless budget horsepower war that D1 and other series have become.   Classes are separated. To my knowledge there is Women's, Beginner, Challenge, and Muscle. May be more. The purpose is to keep it competitive and fun.   IMO this is what drifting is all about. This series as well as MSC are the only two series which reward driver skill and style over engineering and bags of money. The tracks are technical and very fun to watch, 1000hp not needed.   I am not the biggest fan of Formula D, but I get why people like it. For some its all they ever knew of drifting. For me however, in a perfect world, we would have a similar travelling series for real world drifters, you and me. Not just factory backed teams.  Just thought I would share. Please discuss."

You're right, time will tell. I have no incentive to drift the STI because there simply is nowhere to do so locally. Ain't nobody got time for 1,000+ mile road trips.

The people running it now are alright, they are doing some new layouts and back to actually having run groups so its a little better. Nothing like 09' 10' though.

But for everyone here, just keep in mind that drifting, currently, has no where near the amount of complexity of Formula 1 (which I honestly thought that James May was comparing drifting to). So take it what he said like a grain of salt and kill some tires out of spite."

Drifting,2x6rlf,Bloodhay,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:29:10 2015 UTC,Didn't look painful at all to me? It's only shot at 30fps so that could be why it doesn't look extremely fluid. Keep in mind 30fps for that fast of movement zoomed in at 300mm needs to be filmed at 60 to look really good.
Drifting,2x6rlf,Bloodhay,2,Thu Feb 26 21:02:35 2015 UTC,To me it looks like it's the wrong shutter speed because it's a lag not a blur. Do you remember what settings you were using?  IE 24fps at a 1/50th shutter speed will always be smooth regardless of lens size and for 30fps use 1/60th shutter speed so on and so on Edit:Clarity

Drifting,2x19qt,NervousCrayon,4,Tue Feb 24 22:50:40 2015 UTC,I'll always miss the hobby. RC drifting has come a long way since taping up normal wheels or using PVC/ABS pipe..  Anyone else remember this gem?

I was in school and couldn't afford anything decent on my allowance back then, I did 2 D1RC rounds and a ""friendly"" session and spent the rest of my time dicking around on the cul-de-sac I lived in. Had a Tamiya TT01 with a metal propshaft, cheap 19t motor and the world's hottest 1-way front diff. Bloody awful to drive. Somewhere in the loft is a TA05 with some really nice upgrades, in a million pieces, waiting to be built and drifted... I just ran out of money/time at about the same time I got it.  Edit: Here's my first day's drifting, the S15 with silver wheels. Someone else had the same body/paint combo - prepainted one from Tamiya - but with white wheels and nicer electronics."

Drifting,2wvmoi,protomor,6,Mon Feb 23 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"I drive a 2010 Genesis Coupe, and I think for the most part I agree with pretty much what you said, but its worth noting the 2.0T is a little closer to 3200, with the 3.6 around 3300. Not a crazy difference, but hey 100lbs is 100lbs. I don't know THAT much about the platform, a lot of people are probably far more knowledgeable but I do have a fairly decent understanding.  Aftermarket for the V6 isn't that massive, although there are a few turbo options now, but the aftermarket for the 2.0t is HUGE. Maybe not 240sx huge, but it really is big. Genracer is one good shop, but there are many more, with a large number of brands producing a great deal of after market parts.  www.gencoupe.com has some really great info on modding and the cars in general.  http://gctuner.com/ has a lot of stuff http://kdm-racing.com/ is getting a little bigger http://www.khartunerz.com/ is up there too http://beyondredline.com/ was one of the first tuners for the 2.0t http://sfrusa.3dcartstores.com/ is also great, they have a large shop and even a local location in PA where they do custom tunes.  I'm sure someone else might be able to include a few more vendors I missed.  The motors don't really have too many issues, the 2.0t is pushed to around 400hp or so with stock internals (obviously full bolt ons and turbo swap required) but above that you gotta start going inside and swapping somethings out with forged parts. But with the turbo, you can just do full bolt ons (intercooler, full exhaust, intake, blow off, tune, injectors) and you'll be sitting really close to the v6 numbers. You could just take it a step further for a turbo swap (Cheap way is just an Evo X swap).   From what I've heard, Mitsubishi and Hyundai developed the motor together, and I've heard claims that the 2.0t is essentially an Evo motor, just not forged internals (I could be super wrong on this, don't hold me to it - just something I've read a few times on the forums). Hyundai apparently just slapped on the smallest turbo Mitsubishi made.  It might be a little heavier/bigger than some other contenders, but I do think you'll get some style points and stick out a little more."
Drifting,2wvmoi,pineapples234,2,Mon Feb 23 16:40:14 2015 UTC,Sweet. Thanks for the input. So evo motors just bolt in? That's a decent plus! I wonder how well 400whp would do in the chassis. I guess it should be enough for pro am. I seriously wonder why this chassis isn't more popular. I guess entry price?
Drifting,2wvmoi,pineapples234,2,Mon Feb 23 16:59:31 2015 UTC,"I meant more of an Evo X turbo swap, not the whole motor. But I'm sure you could throw in an Evo motor if you really wanted to!  I think its entry price (although you can get a 2.0t for fairly cheap now), the fact that its Hyundai and not a Nissan or something, and the weight is a little off putting as well."
Drifting,2wvmoi,ShadynastyS14,2,Mon Feb 23 17:20:59 2015 UTC,I had no idea they were that big and heavy.   Looking back through your other posts it just goes to show how far the toyobaru knocked it out of the park.  I just hope they start selling better so that we have a replacement for the 240sx.
Drifting,2wvmoi,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:44:50 2015 UTC,The FRZ will be a very popular drift car. They are selling well enough. I wouldn't say they knocked it out of the park. But they are the closest so far.
Drifting,2wvmoi,ShadynastyS14,2,Mon Feb 23 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"Under 3000lbs, less than 30K, and a fairly good suspension setup from the factory is pretty much knocking out of the park now a days.  With the way crash requirements are going it is getting very difficult to keep vehicle weight down.  Also upper management along with marketing will always try to neuter cars to make them appeal to the broader market.  I mean the powertrain is pretty disappointing for how nice the rest of the chassis is, but that can be easily fixed.  Its a lot harder and more expensive to make a chassis lighter, move suspension pickup points, and all that jazz compared to a motor swap.  In the end its all relative.  Dont get me wrong, the Z cars are great and other chassis have potential as well.  But I think in the future the FRZ is going to be the go to 240sx replacement.  Unless Nissan comes out with a new silvia/240sx."
Drifting,2wvmoi,pineapples234,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:16:47 2015 UTC,True true. I think they wanted to make the FRZ for the tuner market. So the engine was more of a side thought. I wouldn't say after thought. Works for the average enthusiast that won't drift it. I do hate that torsen though.
Drifting,2wvmoi,ExcuseMeMrBurgandy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Side thought is definitely a good way to put it. Adequate enough for the average consumer, but not so much that they wasted a huge portion of their budget on it."

Drifting,2wvmoi,ShadynastyS14,2,Mon Feb 23 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"Powered by Max also has the Genesis covered with coils, arms, and an angle kit for drifting.

Drifting,2wvnoq,dpsogood,2,Mon Feb 23 15:45:33 2015 UTC,CNC brakes are for staging. Not really designed to stop the wheels once they are spinning. that's at least why I didn't go with one.   Other than that ASD is the only one I've seen people use ($200).  I got my hands on the sikky prototype and it will be out soon with a similar price tag to the ASD one.   Note: Mine is a prototype. The handle isn't the same as the final. There will be some attachment for a grip on it.
Drifting,2wvnoq,protomor,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"I like that one, The Sikky Prototype is nice, is it reversible?  The CNC one is a push type set up so it goes forward into the dash, Which is what I want to go with as of now.  So a staging handbrake means what? Also, it might help to let you know I don't have a dual calliper system, this will be run in the rear brake lines."
Drifting,2wvnoq,protomor,2,Mon Feb 23 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"Sikky/ASD ones both have the option of a pass through. Neither recommend it however. Reversible? I think Sikky is working on a remote mount system where the master isn't attached to the same piece as the handle. Otherwise, you could just flip it around. I'm not sure if either makes a push style.   Staging brakes are used in drag racing. They are designed to hold the two non drive wheels so you don't eat up the brakes doing a burnout."
Drifting,2wvnoq,protomor,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"OBP makes a push style, Here  What do you think of these ones, not as cool looking as the Sikky/ASD, but sometimes what can you do. Could always get a custom handle made I guess.  I was unaware of that, thanks for the education."

Learn to deal with the stock car and its body roll. That is a good list of mods to get but don't worry about getting them all before you can turn the key. Seat time is your best friend.

Drifting,2wqffk,Gamecubeify,3,Sun Feb 22 10:35:13 2015 UTC,"Get a basic rwd manual car with a locked diff (welded or spooled) or a tight lsd. Chuck some coilovers in it, and go learn. Dont go for modified knuckles or lock mods until you can confidently drift a basic car. Id even suggest something with relatively low power and a short wheel base for learning as it will teach you to throw the car into a slide rather then relying on power to initiate drift.   Start off with power over slides, which is allowing the rear of the car to step out on the exit of a corner.   Then move onto hand brake entries into a corner. The idea here is to use the handbrake to initiate the slide then dump the clutch and use throttle to control it.  After you have that you can move onto feint entries. A more advanced entry into a corner where you use a weight transfer to initiate the drift. This can be done entirely without the hand brake."

Never want to go straight into a high power massive lock car as you will learn bad habbits and struggle if you are ever without. Also learning basic technique first is key. Took me a while to work out gear changes mid drift or mid entry.

Drifting,2wgknp,Vicious713,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:16:29 2015 UTC,Nope he just let off the brakes. The trailer was most likely empty that's why the tires on the trailer locked up and slid. I bet the driver didn't even realize it was sliding until he saw the trailer in his mirror.
Drifting,2wgknp,31794ty,2,Fri Feb 20 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, that could be very interesting. Would love to see this from another angle. Is it true truckers can manually adjust the breaks on the trailer?"

It doesn't look like much, but Vanettes are wicked difficult to drive hard - they've got about 75-80% of the weight over the front wheels, which does give them somewhat of a tendency to drift, but it also gives them a tendency to spin like a top at the slightest provocation."

Other vans - not so bad, unless you're the kind of mentalist who does things like, well, you've done to the previa.

Drifting,2w9ync,thejerk705,4,Wed Feb 18 04:11:06 2015 UTC,The tamiya tt01 chassis was really good when i was into it. lots of parts available. awd is the go. rwd just spins out. i use to wrap insulation tape around the rubber on the wheels and it drifted really well. cheaper than buying the proper drifting wheels
Drifting,2w9ync,skinr,3,Wed Feb 18 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, TT-01 is always a good cheap starting point. I picked up an RTR (Ready To Run) package on ebay a few years ago for $100 or so. @OP, If you see RTR in an ad, it means it comes with the remote, battery, chassis/body, and should come with a battery charger. The type of battery it will come with will vary a bit, so you may look into that.  Another alternative for tires is ABS plastic tubing. Cut it to width, file the edges down, they make for a nice semi-slick wheel."
Drifting,2w9ync,zx666r,2,Wed Feb 18 05:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly that /u/skinr said - Tamiya TT01 (a TT01D really) is the way to go if you want to get into RC drifting. The TT01 D Type E is also an option - same thing as the D, but a more robust construction. They have a couple bodies that you might like - Supras, S15s, FDs, R34s, etc. They're all AWD as are most popular platforms.  TT-02D is also a good option if you can find them. Whichever platform you buy though, you'll most likely have to buy a transmitter, speed controller, batteries + charger, and miscellaneous other pieces. Total will likely be upwards of $250. I wouldn't be surprised if it went up to $400 for a complete ready to run kit.  Also hit up /r/rccars, those guys should be able to help you find or build a complete kit."
Drifting,2w9ync,RB28DETT,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:55:29 2015 UTC,"Ready to run is where it's at. I bought one for about $130 a year or so ago off ebay, and it's been perfect. Don't think hat particular one is still on offer though - but anything similar to what the others have said will be awesome. If you're up for a challenge you can disable the drive to the front two wheels (don't really know what that's called, RWD conversion from AWD(?)), and that can be heaps of fun, but it's way harder and spins out a lot more."

If you're talking pro level, then yeah we might see a few more out there. As far as grass roots, pro-am, and anything else not pro you probably won't see anyone playing with these, at least until they reach costs similar to early 2000's s-chassis (<$3000 for one in decent condition). Where I'm going with that is the main reason I don't see Camaro's becoming common in the sport is cost.  Now my predictions are going to be stuff like Zs-more 350s, then eventually 370s, Toyobarus, and maybe the Genesis. Soon you'll see a few 2015 Mustangs but they will be about as common as 370s and Toyobarus are right now. I think Lexus will start showing up a bit more with the IS/GS chassis as well since, locally at least, JZ swaps seem to be the poor mans LS swap and everyone and their mother is running some kind of JZ setup."

Drifting,2w6yyn,cluggy,6,Tue Feb 17 14:16:21 2015 UTC,Link? Ain't nothin to weld on it. I think someone got something wrong.
Drifting,2w6yyn,protomor,3,Tue Feb 17 14:30:30 2015 UTC,"Only info I can find online is people asking about welding dual mass flywheels into solid. I just don't understand what the purpose is?  And the description of the car just lists ""welded flywheel"" among other mods."
Drifting,2w6yyn,protomor,3,Tue Feb 17 14:45:48 2015 UTC,ah. That makes some more sense. You weld the dual mass flywheel so it acts like a single mass. Better for clutch kicking. Would be better to just get a light single mass flywheel though.
Drifting,2w6yyn,protomor,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"ah ha, thank you!   do you have any experience with them? is it a potential hazard?"
Drifting,2w6yyn,protomor,3,Tue Feb 17 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"The potential hazard is if someone just welded it and called it a day. If it wasn't balanced you could grenade that whole area (crank/trans). If he put a number of miles on it since then, it's probably fine.  I would never do that though. Shitty mod IMO."

Drifting,2vzxd6,canserpants,15,Sun Feb 15 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"No, knuckles and extended control arms are a bad idea. Just replaced the FLCAs with stock replacements. Make sure the car is 100% up to date on maintenance and do some preventative maintenance. Then start modifying. Decent set of coilovers and if your diff hasn't been welded yet have that done. Then just drift it how it is until your skill level outgrows the car. Then modify more. If you can't drift a 150hp car with coils and and welded diff you can't drift anything else."
Drifting,2vzxd6,Griffin-dork,9,Sun Feb 15 21:01:10 2015 UTC,Hey thanks a ton for the input. I'm always appreciative for more experienced guys advice.
Drifting,2vzxd6,Griffin-dork,4,Sun Feb 15 22:17:01 2015 UTC,"No problem. I'm glad your open to advice instead of being the usual buys an S13 and wants to LS swap it immediately type of person. KA power is perfect for now. Build the suspension, Then add power. Thats the best way to do it. There are guys out there with bone stock KAs that are way better and having way more fun than the guys that feel like the need to immediately build a 500hp caged FD car haha."
Drifting,2vzxd6,Griffin-dork,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:58:41 2015 UTC,I would love to be a guy with an ls swapped 240 believe me but I dont have the funds or the knowhow. Sounds like it would be loads of fun though haha.
Drifting,2vzxd6,minnion,1 point,Mon Feb 16 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless you are on a track where you NEED the power, its kind of boring. Its easy mode. You fuck up and you can fix it with power. Instead of having to have the skill and knowhow to set yourself up and link the whole course by being at the top of your game, you can do it so easily it becomes boring. Personally I would rather be in a 250hp SR car. A happy medium."
Drifting,2vzxd6,thetimechaser,5,Mon Feb 16 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"If you dont have coilovers already, snappy knuckles will make your car even harder to drive. More steering angle does help a lot, but also just masks poor driving. I'd spend my money on other things first- adjustable rear arms, new bushings, maintenance items, the coilovers you mentioned, etc.  If I had 1800 and a stock ish car, i'd buy a decent racing seat, , coilovers and some cheap suspension arms."
Drifting,2vzxd6,thetimechaser,3,Sun Feb 15 20:08:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I lied actually I have a pair of Brides with seat rails on the way. The previous owner had some crappy ass type x seats that would literally kill me if I got in an accident. They just fall backward if you lean too hard. I'll try to grab my wallet out of my pocket in the drive through and all of a sudden be looking out the moonroof.... but I'll look around for more applicable items before I commit to new knuckles and front arms.. thanks for the input!
Drifting,2vzxd6,desolatemindspace,3,Sun Feb 15 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"People here are saying no, which is right, but I'll give you the why.   When you are learning its pretty likely you aren't going terribly fast. The issue is at full lock on those knuckle kits, you will slow down a looot. You need to be at a skill level where you are hauling ass constantly and keep up momentum with all that angle.   I'd toss in some rack spacers while your taking apart the front end if a touch more angle will make you comfortable. Drive on those until your drifting ""over angle"" and scrubbing the fronts. Only then would I step it up to the crazy stuff."
Drifting,2vzxd6,whyteboi,2,Mon Feb 16 02:58:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for the input!

Drifting has and always been a fun side thing for me. I'm good at it but it does not make me faster. I learned all of my drifting fundamentals at autocross learning to grip drive. My drift car might get tabs this year. And I'll probably drive it on the street a bit to stretch it's legs. But it sits in my garage not costing me anything.

Drifting,2vd7q0,hobonerz,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"How is dragging the inner tire (apex side, not wall side) and scrubbing speed helping ""snappy transitions"".  Pure Ackermann is for parking your mom's minivan, not a race car."
Drifting,2vd7q0,ShadynastyS14,5,Tue Feb 10 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"That would be true if this was a race car, but it's not.  Fact of the matter is zero ackerman will have no added benefit with his setup.  Edit to clarify the transitions (which i might add is all personal pref.): zero ackerman will slow the wheels rotation on transition from lock to lock because both wheels are basically traveling the exact same path. Some ackerman will help on transition because the wheels are rotating back to, and over center much quicker, mostly on it's own effort, as opposed to having to feed the wheel most of the way through the transition. Because the wheels are not tracking the same, the follow wheel will pull the lead wheel back it's way on transition allowing you to toss the car much harder. For what it's worth, nobody was messing with ackerman in professional drifting till about 2 or so years ago, and I don't know of many, if any at all who run zero ackerman all the way through. For instance, Forrest didn't switch up his ackerman at all til last season, only reason being he needed extra speed and he swapped to wisefab  Here's some examples. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b_yUnooV00 Watch Odi's front wheels on transitions. It's never a fluid motion on rotation, it almost looks like it's going through ""stages"" of rotation. That's because the wheels are not feeding back to center on the rotation fast enough to let the wheel float on it's own. If he didn't feed it back the whole way through, he'd spin.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGzQUfwM8c Watch Forrest's wheel on transition. Light corrections, and quick transitions. This is without a wisefab kit and the ability to mess with ackerman a whole lot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQXzbOwPpaA Now watch this of Forrest with a wisefab kit and ackerman adjustments. Notice how much different the motions look?  https://vimeo.com/28733339  shameless video of myself because my car has stock ka, and stock spindles/no ackerman adjustments other than what occurred naturally after coils, tension rods, tie rod spacers etc..etc..  What I'm getting at ultimately is cars with zero ackerman wont like to transition on their own account, and DEFINITELY won't magically drive ""better"" because, it's all on how you like it to be and what feels comfortable for you. There is no right or wrong, because it's what you want to do. This is why I popped in to say my piece on him just leaving it alone and just driving it, figuring out what works, what doesn't. Low ackerman is only effective if you're looking to gain/hold speed mid drift because you lose the scrubbing on the trailing wheel (like you mentioned). There's really no other major advantages to zero ackerman than that. Which, I might add is basically the only reason ""ackerman"" is a buzzword these days, because everyone is trying to set their cars up for ""competition"", well because it makes you faster through the course, but that's really it.  BUT with all that said, it's all personal preference on how you set up your car so it feels good for you. I am in NO way an expert on alignments, I'm going based off of what I've experienced driving my car and other cars than my own with various setups for the past 9 years. I just make videos and drive whenever I don't have a camera in my hand. I don't really enjoy working on cars, so there's that too."
Drifting,2vd7q0,ShadynastyS14,2,Tue Feb 10 18:48:23 2015 UTC,Stewy Bryant has written some interesting articles on alignments and suspension design for drifting.  He also wrote an article about his thoughts on Wisefab kits.  http://www.inertia-ms.com/blog/?p=781  http://www.inertia-ms.com/blog/?p=857
Drifting,2vd7q0,ShadynastyS14,2,Tue Feb 10 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"Stewy's setups aren't much good for high angle drifting, and are very biased towards hucking backwards entries and coming out smoothly with the rest of the run at much less angle. The car simply doesn't have enough contact patch at high angles. There is a reason professionals are switching to wisefab and TDP kits; they allow drifting at higher angles while maintaining speed and front contact patch.  EDIT: driver preference is key."
Drifting,2vd7q0,hobonerz,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:31:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in reality you wont be using that much angle, keep in mind those are the Pro's.  What Stewy mentioned is that he only throws big backwards entries to fuck around, and the digressive traction curve allows him to slide it in backwards into the corner without bleeding off to much speed.  When actually drifting you wont be using nearly that much lock in most situations, even more so when you are just learning.  He also mentions that having that much grip out to the end of your steering travel masks bad driving habits because it makes it easier to save a spin out.  A lot of it is down to personal preference."
Drifting,2vd7q0,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"I've used a lot of the lock in the wet, even coming to full lock once, but it definitely kills speed off QUICK! While I'm not a seasoned veteran, I have owned these cars for the last 5 years, so I'm pretty comfortable initiating and carrying out your average second gear turn(s). I used to street drift a lot actually, but too many legal issues and the fact that I've matured a bit keep me from doing anything silly now a days."

Drifting,2vevvs,Henshin_A_JoJo,3,Tue Feb 10 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"Well... what chassis you got? There are likely kits and write ups out there.   Simplest answer is that aside from motor/trans. you need a drive shaft, mounts. redone cooling system. Exhaust stuff. And wiring. Easy!"
Drifting,2vevvs,protomor,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:56:25 2015 UTC,No chassis yet. Just a general overall possible list of things needed. What do the swap kits for more popular chassis include mainly? Engine mount mods and wiring?

Drifting,2vaumy,protomor,7,Mon Feb 9 14:23:04 2015 UTC,There was a kid that used a bone stock Rx8 at the local drift events and did exceptionally well. I see these cars popping up on craigslist between $4k and $6k which cant really be beat. Even when you tally in it's shortcoming it's still a lot of car for the money.
Drifting,2vaumy,diablorojo65,8,Mon Feb 9 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"The thing about most of those cheap CL cars is that most of them have 100-120k, which means it'll need a new engine in 15-20k miles. Which is also a good excuse for a LS swap."
Drifting,2vaumy,iproginger,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:31:33 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.
Drifting,2vaumy,diablorojo65,7,Mon Feb 9 20:19:58 2015 UTC,Price!!!I think it should be its own seperate star rating. I think the RX8 is going to be in drift car territory way sooner than say FRS's. The prices for these cars are retarded low these days saw one in the Atlanta clist the other day running with some body damage(not bad) for 3k. A 2005 car for 3ishk that's half the price of most of the 240's on clist these days. Also it looks cool to me I like the 3rd door makes thing easier for cage work etc.... Also run the silky kit on my S13 top notch brah (also have some ideas/complaints if you care..

Drifting,2vaumy,watnoooo,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"FRSs are already down to 16K in my area, absolutely dropping like a rock. BRZs however are holding steady above 22K. Your right though RX-8s are next on the chopping block along with 350zs."
Drifting,2vaumy,watnoooo,3,Wed Feb 11 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"You might want to revisit your suspension section of this. I'm pretty sure that the rx8 doesn't have McPherson front strut. Also the way you are understanding motion ratio in the rear suspension is a little off. From what it looks like the bottom of the strut/spring is bolted directly to the knuckle so the motion ratio is pretty close to being 1/1 if you don't account for the angle of the strut relative to the path of travel of the rear wheel. Also just wondering, why did you focus on motion ratio rather than other aspects of the suspension?"
Drifting,2vaumy,watnoooo,2,Tue Feb 10 04:33:54 2015 UTC,"Ah yes you're right about the front. I think I was just going through things quickly with the front end. I've even taken it apart myself on a few occasions.   The rear motion ratio is 0.84 (front is 0.82). True coil over attaches right at the spindle but as close to the king pin as possible. Which, it ""does"" on an RX8. If you look on the left picture you'll see how much the attachment point sticks out. For example, the average McPherson strut front is a 0.89 motion ratio.   I arbitrarily picked motion ratio when going through pictures of the rear suspension. Kinda jumped at me. Most things these days are multi link and they only vary slightly. Anything else I should have concentrated on?"
Drifting,2vaumy,MrKnister95,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"Cool, glad we got that cleared up.  Just curious, but where are you getting these motion ratio values?  Also you tell me, you work for the team. :P"
Drifting,2vaumy,Erebus172,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"Motion ratios are from a bunch of places. But most reputable seems here  I didn't build the cars. I just work on them. Plus, for an FD level car, you do things very differently. For instance, we used a winter's quick change rear and special axles. So that whole rear end is no where close to stock. Front knuckles are modded and all that. Not much really translates. Even the engine is an LS3 variant with a magnasun super charger. Even running E98."
Drifting,2vaumy,rotorain,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks.  And, yes I am pretty familiar with how different the setup of a pro level car differs from an amateur level car.  Thanks for the info and it must be pretty fun to work on cars of that level."
Drifting,2vaumy,Erebus172,2,Wed Feb 11 01:49:26 2015 UTC,"ah man. I think the most surprising thing for me was how janky some of the cars really are. They just look good from the outside. Though, chelsea denofa's rear bash bar setup is truly inspirational. When your rear quarter panel has it's own shocks for impact, you're thinking hard."
Drifting,2vaumy,rotorain,2,Wed Feb 11 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"I've driven the 231 hp RX8 of my buddy quite a few times. They can drift very well. If you can find a clean one that had (a) good previous owner/s, go for it! Just check the compression and the history before you buy one and you can drift the shit out of it.   The 192 hp ones are good to drift too. But I'd just recommend getting the 231 version simply because there will be a time when you want more power, so take as much as you can get."
Drifting,2vaumy,Erebus172,3,Mon Feb 9 15:37:14 2015 UTC,You need special tools to check compression on rotaries because there are three combustion chambers per rotor. Usually best to let a Mazda dealership or even better a rotary specialist test it for you.
Drifting,2vaumy,rotorain,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"There's one combustion chamber per rotor. It just fires three times (once on each face) for each revolution. You can use a regular spark plug hole compression tester, but you'll have to do some math as Mazda's fancy tool gives a health rating instead of a psi value."
Drifting,2vaumy,Eroda,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I worded that wrong, there is only one combustion chamber but for a compression test you are testing the seals on the rotor.  A regular spark plug hole tester will tell you if the motor is bad but wont necessarily tell you how good the compression is because it pulses so much.  I'm not saying it cant be done, it's just unreliable."
Drifting,2vaumy,Arctic_Ranger,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"You just have to count the pulses in threes, Mazda's fancy tool is digital and counts for you, but if any of the compression cycles drop below a certain psi you know at least one seal is bad and it's time for a rebuild.  That's the great thing about these motors, under normal conditions they never really catastrophically fail, they just slowly deteriorate until they don't get enough compression to work anymore. Even with failing seals, the motor will just make less and less power and be harder to start, but you'll definitely have a lot of warning before it gives up. Seems like piston engines like to work fine for a long time, then a timing belt or some valves pop and grenade the whole thing."
Drifting,2vaumy,Nytr1k,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:27:59 2015 UTC,"Dont get me wrong, I'm definitely a rotard.  It's just a whole different mindset when working on them."

I was attracted to rx-8's because I liked the way they look, they're cheap, relatively practical, and supposedly have excellent suspensions. After a bit of research I stopped looking at them due to laughable gas mileage and reliability. I'm sure it would make a great track car, but for my particular application and budget it wasn't the best choice."
Drifting,2vaumy,eLetoR,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of a chassis that likes to grenade itself.

Drifting,2v6gyv,inkosana,3,Sun Feb 8 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"the rear seat in the x8 and probably every other cressida is just a cushion that sits on the floor pan for the seat and a cushion that sits on the trunk bulkhead for the back. you might be able to fit two racing seats on top of there, but it'd be like booster seats. unless you're giving midgets rides, there's not going to be enough room for people to sit safely back there, especially with helmets on  ALSO, with fixed backs, you want a cage. You basically can't build a safe cage for four people. I could go into detail, but the cliff's notes version is there's no way to do this without making it incredibly dangerous for the people riding in the back"
Drifting,2v6gyv,fergurs,2,Sun Feb 8 17:32:07 2015 UTC,Your question will be answered when you attempt to buy those rails as they have to fit the car. Then you'll also find out if they stock front and rear rails. If they only stock one set of rails I'd assume you can only do the fronts.
Drifting,2v6gyv,thejerk705,2,Sun Feb 8 09:26:40 2015 UTC,"I really doubt you will be able to find rear seat rails for any car. It's just not all that common.  You can however build your own pretty easy. Being that they are for the back you can assume you dont need to adjust them forward or back. That means you can mount them as low as possible to the floor. Most rear floor sections are higher than the front for clearance of things like diff, rear sub frame, suspension mounting points and gas tanks.  That being said, take measurements of the rear height from the floor to ceiling and see how far back you can possibly mount the seat and then measure how far forward the bottom part of the seat will be. The remainder will be how much leg room you have to the back of the front seat."

Drifting,2uii6s,mcd_sweet_tea,9,Thu Feb 5 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"If you look up the body rigidity thing on google, most sources say that the car actually is very stiff from the factory. But still, over the years the chassis will flex and the metal will get soft. So chassis bracing will be a must. Just as it is for 240s and other cars  that are old and get drifted/raced nowadays."
Drifting,2uii6s,mcd_sweet_tea,7,Mon Feb 2 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with the GT86 becoming the next 240 is that toyota isn't making that many, and not selling them very well compared to nissan making about a quarter of a million 240s."

Drifting,2uii6s,ProJoe,5,Tue Feb 3 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm quite skeptical that the 2.0 Boxer even with an SC will make pro-am competition.

Drifting,2uii6s,Mandydeth,2,Mon Feb 2 21:15:44 2015 UTC,Turbo's are always an option. My dad's frs put out somewhere around 600hp on pump gas until we detuned it and put on a smaller turbo for street use now it's 400hp on pump gas and 520ish on e85.

Drifting,2uii6s,Thelegassy,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:12:46 2015 UTC,Depends where you compete. Here in Aus you can compete at the top level with 150kw and rustle plenty of feathers. All depends on how the comp is judged and what track layout is used.
Drifting,2uii6s,Thelegassy,4,Tue Feb 3 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"I find it kind of disappointing that pro drifting has become all about power and tire smoke. The art has lost some of its finesse with the constant power wars.  I've watched some very skilled drivers do some impressive drifting with this car in basically stock form.  I'm not an exceptionally skilled drifter (yet), but I have had my FR-S on the track a few times and done some drifting with it. I love my FR-S as a daily driver, and about 90% of the time I'm satisfied with the power. And even when drifting, in my opinion, it's not power, but rather torque that's missing. Particularly in the ""dip"" around around the 3.5 - 4k rpm mark. Get it making over 200 lbs of torque at the wheels and maybe add a little extra steering angle, and I think it would be a very willing drift car, even if it lacked the drama needed to be competitive at the professional level."
Drifting,2uii6s,Thelegassy,3,Tue Feb 3 11:26:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree but agree with you. I think the power wars are a bit absurd at this point. I think much of it is just posturing. But no way is 200whp enough to link irwindale and hit all the outer zones. Maybe stay sideways through the whole thing, but not hitting all the clips. Just not enough power."
Drifting,2uii6s,Thelegassy,3,Tue Feb 3 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"a BRS/FRS will never be the next 240 because they aren't selling enough of them.  The E46 chassis will be ""the next 240"""

Drifting,2uii6s,Thelegassy,3,Tue Feb 3 11:30:57 2015 UTC,Maybe when the list winds down. I'm trying to concentrate cars that have production years starting past 2000. I feel like the SC series would start to become popular by now if it was going to. You see them now and then. But not often. I think the IS series is more likely but man those things are expensive.

Drifting,2uii6s,Smitty1331,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"You're rating that suspension very high, to be a competitive drift car you have to do a ton of work to make the car work properly. People are starting to get it figured out and working pretty good but it's basically replacing everything and moving the steering rack under the subframe."
Drifting,2uii6s,Smitty1331,6,Mon Feb 2 20:52:05 2015 UTC,Compared to other cars it's pretty simple.
Drifting,2uii6s,Erebus172,-2,Mon Feb 2 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"It's really not simple at all, that's why dai is using the same engineer tony used to try and make his car work. The front suspension  is not good for drifting from the factory, people always  seem to think its good but it really isn't."
Drifting,2uii6s,quadrupleboat,2,Mon Feb 2 21:09:02 2015 UTC,specifics?
Drifting,2uii6s,KamiKKazi,-2,Mon Feb 2 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Basically everything, you have to fix the suspension and steering geometry that the factory set up has. The one kit that people know is the wisefab kit and this particular kit moves the steering rack under the subframe.     There is a reason everyone who was very good and switched to this chassis isn't as good anymore.  look at dai he was super competitive and now not so much, like I said he has hired the engineer tony used to help him sort out the front of his car. I'm sure down the line it will get sorted but right out of the box the front setup is trash and needs tons of help to be more than a grassroots fun car."
Drifting,2uii6s,probablyhrenrai,5,Mon Feb 2 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Dunno who tony is. Mike Kojima is his chassis guy. Don't quite get what putting the rack under the subframe does. Perhaps if you increase caster, you'll need to push the rack forward to keep it aligned but I don't really see THAT much caster."
Drifting,2uii6s,peacepowder,-2,Mon Feb 2 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"tony is tony angelo, and its not a chassis guy its an engineer to help figure out the front end and make it work.  read this it will help http://www.keevinet.ee/wiseshop/index.php/en/shop/subaru/subaru-brz-front-kit-detail"
Drifting,2uii6s,tobberobbe,5,Mon Feb 2 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"The more I read, the more moving the steering rack makes sense since it's out of plane from the factory (boo).

They do really nice work, and despite the fairly ridiculous spring rates I had they rode fantastic.  The cost me around $1400.  However if you don't need anything fancy, a normal set of fortune autos will be fine for what you are doing and will save you a few hundred.  Coilovers, solid subframe bushings, trailing arm bushings, tree house racing lollipop bushings, and either add clutch plates and shims to your diff or throw it out and weld an open instead.  The Achilles heal of any e30 is that sorry excuse for a diff BMW put in there.  Try sliding with that, if it doesn't work out for you, add sway bars."

Drifting,2tu6l2,oddtoddlers,2,Tue Jan 27 18:14:21 2015 UTC,Should have mentioned the glass subframe mounts that crack away horribly and then you have to take apart almost the entire rear end to weld in a giant plate to fix it.
Drifting,2tu6l2,oddtoddlers,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:11:55 2015 UTC,Yea even on M models you want to reinforce before it gets to that point. The video shows the worst version of that I've ever seen. I wouldn't call them glass. But they definitely don't like abuse.
Drifting,2tu6l2,ProJoe,2,Mon Feb 2 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"Regarding the driveline/subframe comment: all M3's require subframe reinforcement.  The only non-M's that require subframe reinforcement is the 330 and 328. The 328 is more prone due to being an earlier model with different engine (1999, M50).  And this is more common on manuals compared to autos."
Drifting,2tu6l2,ProJoe,3,Tue Feb 24 08:38:40 2015 UTC,They all do. The 2000 and below models (323/328) are M52TU engines. But the reinforcements on the later (325/330) models are still inferior. Even M3s have torn them out with lots of track abuse.
Drifting,2tu6l2,Forbsey,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:20:48 2015 UTC,I'm aware that launching any E46/treating them poorly will crack the subframe. In your original post however you implied that non M3's have frequent subframe issues while M3's rarely have subframe problems (whilst the opposite is true).    E46 M3 subframes were so bad BMW had a recall that is still going to this day (10 year warrenty for subframe damage so still applicable to 2006 models).  E46's with most subframe problems (in order):  M3  328  330  323  325
Drifting,2tu6l2,Forbsey,2,Tue Feb 24 12:20:47 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that info? Regardless, it's a weak point on any E46. I'll concede to that point."
Drifting,2tu4tc,Doodface,3,Tue Jan 27 13:10:35 2015 UTC,I actually LOVE the idea of this channel.   Suggestions: * Need better camera/microphone. I hear a lot of background noise and the voices are kinda hard to hear. * Lighting. I'm not fond of the couch but that's ok. I can't really see the guys that well. * Length. I'd try to keep it to 5 min max. 10 if there's a ton to go through. People don't have a huge attention span these days. This could be shortened a lot. Editing! * Interactivity: They reference a lot of things. Maybe do that youtube on screen tagging thing where you can click on the video/url. Great way to get paid in the future should this take off

Drifting,2tf2la,SeriouslySam,7,Fri Jan 23 16:55:24 2015 UTC,Don't think I didn't hear that Finish the Fight single piano note from Halo 3!
Drifting,2tf2la,CogBlocker,5,Fri Jan 23 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, I thought the note was so subtle that no one would ever notice. Second, I have been so enamored with that one note that I have been anxiously saving it for the right project to replicate it.  Ever since I was a kid and plugged my Xbox into the living room TV when my parents were out of town and I cranked the volume to inhuman levels, I knew that single note was incredible. I'm happy some one else caught it, but damn you for recognizing my blatant reproduction of ""the note."""
Drifting,2tf2la,zf420,1 point,Sat Jan 24 10:53:17 2015 UTC,I absolutely loved Halo back in the day but I didn't even notice the note. The video was fucking amazing though so maybe it had some subliminal effect...

Basically we are going through 2014 footage from the European Drift Championship, and selecting the most interesting shots to share with the world. Seeing that this subreddit is related to drifting, I thought everyone will enjoy seeing our work, especially seeing that there was quite some effort put into it (good quality equipment, 5-8 camera guys at each race, 8 races across Europe).

Drifting,2t15ho,Raxi95,3,Tue Jan 20 12:16:57 2015 UTC,"All drift spec cars have to be RWD. So yes, all the current drift spec GTRs around the world are RWD. Here is a list of drift spec GTRs out there right now, as we know it: Daigo Saito- Formula D- 1000 HP Robbie Nishida- Formula D Asia- 1000 HP Masato Kawabata- D1GP - 1000 HP  And there's another one being built in Europe, for the European Drift Championship/British Drift Championship.  For your second question, the tyres aren't made specifically to pump out extra smoke. These tires are built for serious grip, even though you might not think that, and most pro drifters use Semislicks, in Kawabata's case , it's the Toyo Tires R888 probably."
Drifting,2t15ho,Raxi95,1 point,Tue Jan 20 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured, are there any drift cars (not official drift spec) that run AWD?  Huh interesting, that just seems like a ton of smoke, I mean I've seen drag burnouts, and burnout competitions that don't get that smokey."

Drifting,2t15ho,MrKnister95,0,Tue Jan 20 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well technically, if it's not RWD , it cannot really be a drift car.

There's a difference of between 300-400 lbs in curb weight. Also, the newer v6s produce over 300hp and have a lot of potential to make wayyyy more than that. Of course, the torque that the v8s make is preferable. I usually like these posts, but this was a little bit flawed"

I still stand by my statement of ""basically the same""  Their weights may be different but most of the car is the same. Similar width Same solid rear axle Same V6/V8 options (tho newer V6s are better) Very similar after market Same front suspension and terrible factory angle."

Drifting,2t1uj3,Shinny1337,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Well if you mean the brand new mustangs (2015), they're designated S550. Of course the big deal with them is the new IRS. You can get the base 3.7L V6 with 300hp. There's a 2.3L turbo I4 with 310hp. The GT has a 5.0L V8 with 435hp. They gained about 100lbs over the previous generation unfortunately."
Drifting,2t1uj3,Nismo240guy,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more of the SN197 since the latest generation won't likely be on track anytime soon. I feel like if SN95s were going to make an appearance, they would have already. But aside from doug vanderbrink, no one has bit. I'm thinking SN197s will start coming out to play soon. So the discussion is mostly aimed there."
Drifting,2t1uj3,Shinny1337,2,Tue Jan 20 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"I think the older SN95 and foxbodies will grow like the 240's have despite their age relatively. I personally don't care much for the 4.6 motor. The solid rear axle is not as much a hinderence as everyone says. I drifted my SN95 convertible bone stock and placed 8th in a competition at mineral wells Texas. The weight and rear axle really just take a more careful approach to spring, bump and rebound rates. Does that mean they're less capable on the razors edge? Maybe, but for grassroots or proam I believe they are a greatly untapped market. As far as the newer models go I'm interest to see if the V6's that have 300hp will start showing up. I'm also supper excited about the new 350GT with the scat crank. Will be quite awhile before anyone is using those though."

Drifting,2slj2m,workisnotfun,5,Fri Jan 16 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're trolling, but I'll answer as if you're not.   Short answer: No.  Long answer: Your Corolla is Front-wheel drive. (Basically) all drift cars are RWD. Some are AWD, but drifting a FWD car is just not feasible.   The automatic gearbox doesn't help much either. You can run in L 2 or 3, but most modern cars will shift when necessary.  Also, I assume your car has traction control, which you could likely disable by removing a fuse.  I would suggest not yanking your hand brake to break traction in the rear end, because you will likely understeer in to things."
Drifting,2slj2m,HKNation,2,Fri Jan 16 05:07:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer. I am completely new to the topic and am glad I asked here.   I'd actually read that it's possible to drift with just the hand brake but did not know about the RWD only cars could drift. I've been watching the anime Initial D lately and was hoping to get into it. I guess I'll probably have to rent an appropriate car to try.
Drifting,2slj2m,HKNation,2,Fri Jan 16 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a good simple video explaining why/what will happen.   There are some FWD cars with tons of power that are able to break out the rear end, but a stock Corolla won't really be much fun to slide."

Drifting,2slj2m,5t4k3,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:15:57 2015 UTC,I'm a little sad I thought for sure it was the vid of some guy throwing a newer corolla around a turn and breaking it on a lightpole. You should probably watch that one as well. If you really want to get into drifting start with some sim games. Or even just forza 4. Make the investment into a racing wheel. I'd go Fanatech if I could do it all over as they are great and work with 360/Xbox1/PC. If a $400 dollar wheel plus games and console or PC makes you say Eww that's expensive you don't need to try to do anything in a real car.
Drifting,2slj2m,Shinny1337,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:23:44 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between $400 on a single video game vs money for a car. I can justify spending more on a car, and I really want a wheel."

Drifting,2slj2m,eowen96,2,Sun Jan 18 11:28:49 2015 UTC,The simple answer is no. To drift you need a RWD car. Plain and simple. Please don't try in your corolla either. You will just endanger yourself and others and there is a high chance of you wrecking in the process.

For angle, you'd probably need to modify your knuckles and install aftermarket arms and links. Look up Van Cleef Motorsports to get an idea of it. They got their MK3 down to something like 2600-2700 lbs. and have done a couple of other things suspension-wise.  For power, most have done a JZGTE swap, JZGE NA-T conversion, or built their 7MGTEs.

As a first drift car your going to suck no matter what so it's no huge deal, As long as you enjoy it. The mk3 needs some power to make it a fun drift car due to the weight where on 86s and s13s you can get away with pretty low power and still have a lot of fun. As always a s chassis, 86 and FC are the best choices to start with."
Drifting,2sd0du,Fleemer,3,Wed Jan 14 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  Long answer: Terrible engine, terrible suspension.. emphasis on the terrible engine. $3500 is waaaaaaaaay high anyway even if it was a turbo with an R154 5-speed. They go for $500-1500 all the time.  Don't get it until you learn more about MKIIIs and understand the headaches you're going to have trying to turn it into a nimble drift car.

Kaaz diff and new clutch sitting in the garage. Waiting to blow my stock shit up but its rainy and easy on diffs right now in WA.   Basically I just got sick of shitbox s13s and stepped it up. Drives super nice. I love the power band, very easy to drive, but also kind of boring. The steering is really clean, not sure how much my mods affected it. The best way I can sum up driving this car feel wise is kinda like a big fat Miata. Its plenty capable, but you know the weight is there.   AMA  Yes I agree, style is very ""meh"". I think this is because of their lack of popularity tuner wise in Japan. None of primary aero companies really picked up on it. Hopefully this will change as more schassis get bent and more people start driving Zs."

Most people start with exhaust replacement, then maybe a few panels to pick up style points. Then you would gut the interior and pull the sound deadening, then to really finish the deal you would cut out the rear compartment / speaker box and go carbon doors. I'm pretty sure you can get these down around 3000lbs but its pretty permanent once you hack out the speaker box haha."

Drifting,2s5v9b,Shinny1337,1 point,Mon Jan 12 23:46:18 2015 UTC,Gotta theorize before you throw a bunch of money at a new chassis. Not everyone gets a chance to drive every care before they buy one.
Drifting,2s5v9b,GodDonut,2,Tue Jan 13 00:21:15 2015 UTC,Question on weight:  How much can one reasonably expect to drop from properly stripping the extraneous things out of a car?
Drifting,2s5v9b,Shinny1337,2,Mon Jan 12 23:58:10 2015 UTC,The FD prepped one I was working with got down to 3100 IIRC. But that's also with a cage in and all the trimmings.
Drifting,2s5v9b,GodDonut,1 point,Tue Jan 13 00:21:46 2015 UTC,Well I think the weight factor will be relative. Will it be at a disadvantage now sure. Will it 5-10 years from now when 240's are fewer due to rust or wrecks? Probably not. Most cars are tipping in on the heavier side the newer you go. I think the one stand out will be the brand new miata if its like they say it will be. I really only like the way the 240Z's looked even the 260's look too long. Does the 350 have a vlsd stock? I've never liked that kind of diff but as you said there are other options to put in.
Drifting,2s5v9b,MDK350,5,Mon Jan 12 14:24:57 2015 UTC,"I really only like the way the 240Z's looked even the 260's look too long.   The 240z, 260z, and 280z were all the same length. 99% same body.

Drifting,2s5v9b,autoHQ,2,Mon Jan 12 22:25:46 2015 UTC,Weight is very relevant. The RX8 starts off at 3050 from the factory. FRZs are 2700lbs. I do see cars getting heavier. I would consider the 350z upper mid pack on weight though. Hence still 2 out of 5 stars.   IIRC they are vlsd. Swapping it out for aftermarket is simple though. Tons of options.
Drifting,2s5v9b,autoHQ,3,Mon Jan 12 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"Base is open diff, other trim levels are vlsd, and its garbage."

The tiny amount of superior filtering you would get from a name brand filter is completely negated by how often you change the oil in the car. In a daily driver, I would prefer a K&N. In a car that will see 100 miles in between oil changes, this will do just fine."
Drifting,2s56y7,MrKnister95,0,Wed Jan 14 10:00:13 2015 UTC,K&N is just as bad on a car with a MAF system. Oil can get through the filter and reach the MAF.   obviously we are going to have to agree to disagree here.

They were supposed to protect the paint from rock chips, but all they did was add ugly and scratches from flapping in the wind and dirt trapped under them.   Can totally still buy them too."

Just get a bucket seat and leave the factory 3 point until you get a real harness bar or cage. Those types of harnesses are designed to only work with racing seats. Without them, they aren't useful.  If you do have a racing seat, mounting the harnesses to anything but a bar/cage is a safety hazard. People debate it but I wouldn't do it."

I know this isn't what you want to hear, but instead of buying a $1000 and trying to drop $5000 to make it drift ready, you're better off buying a $3000 chassis that's proven. You know, 240sx, e36, etc. People drift them for a reason. Drop a G on nice coilovers and weld a diff, and that's enough to make them a decent drift car.  You've got the task of basically trying to make an antique tank drift. Parts will be hard to come by and extremely expensive. Don't bother with ""building it"" or power mods yet, you don't need much power to get started.   You're better off focusing on suspension mods and weight reduction, pretty much anything to try and make a car from '79 handle a little better."

Drifting,2rycz9,Pumacaine,3,Sun Jan 11 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed the car can be driven until the engine goes while you work on the suspension. I'm not a huge Nissan guy but Ive seen a couple of really bad ass 240Z track cars so they're getting suspension from somewhere. Try to find forums for the old Z's and see what parts they are using. I think you should be able to weld the diff without it being too heavy. I think when the stock motor goes an RB would be a good route. As far as drifting standards you'll want some camber upfront, don't go crazy though, zero toe all the way around very minimal camber in the rear maybe .5 degrees. And you'll want the front shocks and springs harder than the rear. you'll have to see if you can get lucky and use angle kits off of something like a 240sx or 350z."
Drifting,2rycz9,Shinny1337,2,Sat Jan 10 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"one of the main issues you'll come across is that the car has NO angle at all. the frame gets in the way and needs to be heavily modified if you wanna do even anything serious. Also if you plan an RB swap, whats your budget? they're waaaaaaay more expensive than you think. If you go RB20 you might as well go RB25 as price is gonna be high anyway. Figure out your budget then double it and you have an RB swapped car. I spent over 20k on my RB25 260z and my initial estimate was 10k."
Drifting,2rycz9,ARMOG1820,2,Sat Jan 10 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"Step 1 is get rid of that fucking Z and get a better chassis. Its harsh and blunt but really, an S30 is NOT a chassis you use for your first drift car. Even veterans don't drift them. They dont have the potential as a drift car. You really should sell it and get a 240, e36, rx7, etc. Forget about the ""I want to be different"" bullshit. If its your first drift car get something that will work for sure.

However, the chase car is clearly much faster than the leader, and he also makes an error in trying to close the gap too quickly.  I'd say a loss of drift as in the first corner, where he'd have crashed if he hadn't corrected, should be enough to lose the battle. Then he does it again in the second corner. Chase car gets the advantage."
Drifting,2rwdoc,probablyhrenrai,16,Fri Jan 9 21:32:04 2015 UTC,Very slightly stretched tires can improve control in quick direction changes as it reduces flex in the sidewall. Most of the time though stretched tires referring  to stance is purely for cosmetics. Reduced contact patch with additional weight of a wider wheel hinders performance.
Drifting,2rwdoc,Wolfattak,11,Fri Jan 9 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"Some (most) do it for form, some for function.  Form - The look of fitting bigger/wider wheels and the skinny/stretched tyre helps it fit in the guard  Function - Less shoulder roll, less play when losing traction, a variety of reasons.   Less contact patch depending on the size of rim.   If you can only run a 225 tyre, you can simply run that same width tyre or a wider rim for added sidewall rigity/less sidewall flex. It's not always about sacrificing tyre width when racing/drifitng"

For sliding around and having fun it's ok but to be good at drifting the front suspension design isn't suited for it.    read this it explains the fixes needed for the front suspension and steering https://www.facebook.com/Wisefab/photos/a.785006571549557.1073741831.266037546779798/785006588216222/"
Drifting,2rv0vj,Thelegassy,3,Sat Jan 10 14:11:55 2015 UTC,The pro guys are struggling because theyve all switched to a new chassis that has no pro data built up. Everyone else is still using proven cars that they've had time with. It wouldn't matter if the toybaru came with parallel steering from factory those cars have to be dialed in to the knife's edge. The stock cars turn left and right and thats good enough. By your agruement of it having shitty geometry every stock car has the same shitty geometry. No car comes from the factory with Formula D levels of steering angle or the capability to do so.

With the budget these guys run you're not really constrained by the suspension geo. The only issue would be the stock pick up points which wisefab seem to work around with pretty much every kit they make.   Your typical drifter should probably be more interested in decent geo (decent roll centre height, camber gain and castor etc) which I imagine is pretty decent on the FRS being a modern sports car running SLA. Thats just my opinion though."

Arm length, pivot points and upright lengths give you plenty of adjustably.  So we're settled then, the FRS is bad for drifting because it requires drastic rack location for mega lock? How many drifters do you think actually need or have the ability to properly use decent lock let alone enough power. Theres a lot more to a good car than spastic lock. Kawabatta was going backwards long before wisefab and he wasn't even running that much lock! Hell just look at team burst."

True, they do have more power, but they're a little more complicated electronically and they're also pretty heavy.  I think a 350z with it's v6 drifts only a little bit better than a 240sx with a DOHC KA in terms of power/weight ratio, steering angle, stiffness, etc."
Drifting,2rv0vj,autoHQ,1 point,Mon Jan 12 04:47:04 2015 UTC,Koukis are still going for 8k.
Drifting,2rv0vj,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Mon Jan 12 11:50:44 2015 UTC,They are now but so are all 240s.  From what I hear you could get a kouki In good shape for 3kish back in the day
Drifting,2rv0vj,autoHQ,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely believe that, but the demand for the S-Chassis has soared in the last couple years."
Drifting,2rv0vj,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:07:08 2015 UTC,exactly.  But it seems like 350z's are stuck at the 7k and up price.  Like people think the 350z is more car than the 240sx
Drifting,2rv0vj,autoHQ,11,Tue Jan 13 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Is300's will eventually become a regular. Once they drop around $5000, every 17/18 year old will buy one in hopes of ""building"" a 2jz monster with an ebay turbo kit and no tune."
Drifting,2rv0vj,kevincuddington,3,Fri Jan 9 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Though they're fantastic cars, they're fairly pricey when it comes to suspension geo. The beauty of the nissans is that you can get decent lock/camber/castor etc fairly cheaply.   In the UK its all about whats cheap. E36 beemers have taken off, the e36 compacts are everywhere now."

But straight 6 singing is the best thing ever."
Drifting,2rv0vj,no1likesthetunahere,9,Sat Jan 10 18:26:24 2015 UTC,350z's are already starting to be pretty common it seems. I've never seen an rx8 running around at an event. BMW's will start picking up in the states i feel. Possibly miatas?
Drifting,2rv0vj,desolatemindspace,3,Fri Jan 9 16:48:55 2015 UTC,So true about the RX8 I'm not sure what the problem is with them but no-one wants'em.
Drifting,2rv0vj,Dubloverism,5,Fri Jan 9 20:37:16 2015 UTC,Nobody wants the poor ol' rotary :(
Drifting,2rv0vj,Jdibs77,2,Fri Jan 9 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"Theyre relatively heavy, have fuck all for power, and limited aftermarket/power options."
Drifting,2rv0vj,rapturedjesus,4,Fri Jan 9 23:17:54 2015 UTC,"There is a lot you can do aftermarket-wise. In stock form, the engine is good for handling because of the weight distribution it allows the car to achieve. With a port, turbo setup (upgrading to a better one or adding one if you don't have one), better internals, exhaust/intake, and an ecu upgrade, upwards of 400whp is possible. They are easy to disassemble and rebuild, so the actual modifications are relatively easy. The only problem is the fact that nobody knows a damn thing about them. It's easy to learn, it's just that nobody needs to. And V8 swaps are relatively common among the RX cars"
Drifting,2rv0vj,Jdibs77,-3,Fri Jan 9 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"Listen to yourself lol, so if you basically completely rebuild the motor and spend $6k+ turboing the stupid thing you'll make 400+whp.  Woopty friggin doo!  That's doable with a 2j and $2k on top of it, and in the end the 2j will be more reliable.   Sorry about the whole 2jz bandwagon thing, but its a fact."
Drifting,2rv0vj,rapturedjesus,6,Sat Jan 10 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"If you pick a platform with a 2jz, then sure! But if you're talking about a swap, 1. That's kinda difficult compared to rebuilding a rotary, and 2. It's gonna be more expensive than just the 2k you're putting aside for engine parts.   Porting the car requires no extra parts, so if you can do it by yourself, it's 100% free. The internal parts are again...easy to install, and there's not a whole lot to buy. Other than that, it's just upgrading the turbo setup, the injectors, and the ecu.  So you end up with basically a brand new engine, which is gonna last a lot longer than a used 2jz. They are also very capable of revving high for long periods of time without any harm.  The advantages of the rotary aren't in the power output on its own. You have to take into account many other things. Repairs are easy shit because there are very few parts. They rev very smoothly and can rev all day long. The compact size gives a low center of gravity and can be placed far back, which affects the handling capabilities.  I'm not trying to say it's the best car ever. I'm just saying that they aren't a terrible choice. Cheap power is not the only thing that a car should be judged on. And my 400+whp figure is actually for my generation RX-7, the FC. Really anything with the 13b. I have no idea what the Renesis (the RX-8's motor) is capable of"
Drifting,2rv0vj,Jdibs77,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Ive got an rx8, he's got a point you can't really do fuck all with a renesis. If you port it, and run a port too large you can drill into the coolant jackets. You can still turbo them and get good gains but what's a rotary without the good old brap sound the bridgeport gives it? So rew swap the bastard, port, turbo, ass load of boost, tune it, and you're set. Not a bad way to spend 10-15k.."
Drifting,2rv0vj,pburke67,-4,Wed Jan 21 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"Right, youre listing reasons, in my experience/opinion, not to go near RX8s lol. Get something that needs less to get out and drive. Youre going to be needing to change a lot to make one a reliable, consistent drift car.   I'll give it to you rotary guys, you're die hard...arguably to a fault lol."

I even saw the Cobra IRS for sale in my town just two days ago. I would jump on it but its too much fab work putting it into the older chassis. Idk much about RX8's except all the FD owners I know didn't want the newer car. Your biggest issue will be the diff. Sports cars have been getting weaker and weaker with diffs. So yeah if you've got the money to buy something newer like that get rid of the vlsd or torsen if that's what they have ans weld an open or get a good clutch type diff. Unless the car has been ratted out that's all you should need to start. Learn the car before diving into any upgrades.

They can still be expensive but once you get away from an M3, 2000 and 2001 325's I can imagine will be somewhat affordable soon and I think they have pretty good power out of the box. I know a guy that has a four door e46 3 series, probably a 325 but I'll find out. He actually was able to retrofit a kouki s14 aftermarket front bumper onto his car pretty easily, so there's that flexibility. I think parts are just gonna be a bitch with them."

Drifting,2rtlgz,thetimechaser,-1,Fri Jan 9 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"If you haven't built or driven a drift car before just pick up a decent S-chassis to get your chops with. It can be very frustrating sourcing parts for oddball chassis and finding knowledgeable people to help you work on them. What's important in the beginning is seat time.    If you really want to start with something more unique, just got with an X8 Cressida. You could also do an SC300 or 400. Maybe a GS300. Toyotas have tons of interchangeable parts and IMO the most reliable engines ie. JZ series. Anything further from the norm then that and you may find yourself more frustrated then it's worth."
Drifting,2rr7w8,ShadynastyS14,8,Thu Jan 8 16:36:50 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic and pretty spot on. This idea is basically why cars like the GT86 should exist, and also why people aren't as excited because they are ""too slow"". When you have a slow car at its limit it's amazing. You realize you're in control of this ridiculous machine that runs on explosions and you sync up with it. Driving fast cars is also fun, but there are a lot of new stock cars that are hard to find the limit of on a track. If you can't find the limit of the car it's going to be harder to improve your skill.   Thanks for posting this."
Drifting,2rr7w8,MisterSambone,2,Thu Jan 8 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"That's a good read. And it's very true.   These days build threads are really deceptive as too how much time, effort and money that needs to go into the build. Those who SHOULD be doing those build threads aren't usually the ones that are. (Insert just about any Turbo'd LSx 240 build thread here).   Attention is the main purpose of this sport, it is a spectators sport after all. And a lot of that attention comes from the car itself, the sound it makes, how much body damage is on the car, stickers/decals, what parts are on/in it. And because of that Average Joe with two drift days under his belt thinks that the only way he'll get recognition is with a high dollar, high horsepower build, as opposed to actually driving well and knowing what he/she is doing behind the wheel.   edit:  I have a feeling this will get downvoted. If you disagree with what I said let me know. You're points may be valid and even change my mind."
Drifting,2rr7w8,frozenmoustache,1 point,Thu Jan 8 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"Its completely true though, everyone seems to think you need a motor swap with crazy power to drift. But hell I've been sliding a stock KA s14 with a lot of a suspension for a while now.  If it wasn't in such bad shape I wouldn't even be building my cressida, but I can't justify spending more money on it.  So I'm keeping it as a backup/practice car and eventually I might swap the suspension over to another chassis because I really like sliding it.  I thoroughly enjoy out driving the kids that show up to their first few drift days with some crazy built LS 240sx that can't slide even a single corner with it.    Also people don't realize that when you change a thousand things on a car at once its a lot harder to set it up or identify issues when you don't know what you are doing.  If you don't know how the car should feel or what it should do, you will never get it right."
Drifting,2rr7w8,frozenmoustache,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"I think that anyone's first drift car should be exactly what you did with your S14. Stock power with a good suspension set up, then you just learn while destroying that car (in the best way possible).   I couldn't agree more with your last point of people making so many changes all at once, then the car handles completely differently and they don't know why. Hell I put sway bars in on my stock STi and waited 3 weeks to install the endlinks because I wanted to see what the difference would be. I don't think that you can properly appreciate the mods you do without actually feeling how each little part may improve the car."
Drifting,2rr7w8,frozenmoustache,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"Also as a declaimer,  I have to say that I used to have the same problem talked about in the article.  I was the worst offender.   Then I sold it all, my friends and I put together a parts bin s14 with nice suspension and it was the greatest choice ever.  Only things I had to fix all season was putting new brake pads on it and fresh tires every drift day or two.  I learned so much driving that thing, and I still plan on driving it more."
Drifting,2rr7w8,thetimechaser,2,Thu Jan 8 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"Oh I am too.  I'm building an autocross/time attack car that I have no reason putting as much power as I can in.

Drifting,2rr7w8,MisterSambone,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"Great read. Not drifiting but spirtied driving in the canyons late late at night comes to mind. I didnt have anything done to my 89 ka24e but blown shocks with tien springs and efans (previous owner) and i drove the hell out of the car trying to get in tune with it.  Pretty soon i was beating tuned up turbo civics, s13/s14 sr's and a couple rsx but that was the beauty of driving. When you get more experienced with a road/track you start to know what to watch out for and how to attack that upcoming corner."
Drifting,2rr7w8,MisterSambone,2,Thu Jan 8 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"This will start off ludicrous until I explain. I did what you did with a Corvette. It's an older car, at the time the numbers were impressive, but I'm making maybe 200HP-300Lbs/ft at the wheels and when I got the car it was a disaster suspension and brake wise. I learned to drive fast in a CRX with half the power, so the Corvette was a major upgrade. Lots of people with overbuilt cars in the area can't hang with me in the canyons around a corner. I of course have plans for building like everyone else, but it's all about learning the car first for me."
Drifting,2rr7w8,MisterSambone,2,Fri Jan 9 00:56:07 2015 UTC,Damn thats dope! Canyon carving is on par with drifitng. i kind of want to build a fun canyon/daily crx and keep my 240 for drift/track. But project cars are an expensive hobby :p
Drifting,2rr7w8,hurryitshappening,2,Fri Jan 9 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"It's a great canyon car because it's so light. And honestly pretty cheap. I actually have this fantasy of building a canyon 240 that's set up entirely for grip. It's hard to find a decent chassis lately though, drift tax and all.  Plans for the Corvette also accomplish similar goals, so we'll see. I agree about having projects. It all adds up so quickly."
Drifting,2rr7w8,thetimechaser,2,Fri Jan 9 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, i want to learn the car drifiting a bit just in case i ever find myself going sideways i will hopefully be able to correct it.  Yeah a crx would be dope but a full time attack 240 is my ultimate goal. What have you done to the corvette so far?"
Drifting,2rr7w8,thetimechaser,2,Fri Jan 9 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Drifting is great for finding the limits of grip in your car. It forces you to figure out the balance of the car if you want to stay sideways for any length of time. It's also really good for throttle control. It definitely is good to know if you want to learn the handling of your car.  A time attack 240 would be amazing. The balance is really nice in them and once you get comfortable adding power is pretty easy as well.  The Corvette had a butchered wiring harness and interior, an aged and abused suspension, and the motor was getting into it's maintenance cycle when I got it. So far I've added polyurethane bushings, new Bilstein shocks, multiple brake boosters, a rebuilt interior with the wiring mostly taken care of, and fresh brake pads. Last year I added 1.6 ratio roller rockers, a new water pump, HEI coil, plugs, wires, intake gaskets, and deleted the AIR pump. I currently have a set of C5 Z06 brakes, longtube headers, a Lingenfelter Superram intake plenum, a zf6 transmission with short throw, and an aluminum flywheel to add on in the not so distant future. I'm saving up to swap out the rear differential for the stronger Dana 44, and adding a heim joint setup for the rear end links and control arms. My plans for the future are coilovers (at minimum adjustable shocks and different leafs), 18s all around, C6 Z06 brakes, and a forged 383 with goals of around 430HP at the wheels. That's all a ways away though, I'll need the car to feel slow again after the upcoming mods before building a motor."
Drifting,2rses4,dpsogood,5,Thu Jan 8 22:01:23 2015 UTC,Short answer: Slows you down and tightens up your drift (pulls you into the corner not out).
Drifting,2rses4,protomor,3,Thu Jan 8 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I've been playing with the brakes lately and everytime I start em my drift goes into the corner pretty hard. Working on the control of this."

Drifting,2rses4,Shinny1337,3,Fri Jan 9 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"I think you may not get.the desired effect just playing with the brake its something to be used in specific situations as Vinny said. Since you mentioned mid slide ill talk about that. When you've got a corner that decreases in radius or transitioning to a much slower speed corner you can use the brakes without throttle to keep the car rotating while slowing your speed. I often use the brakes on long corners when my car wants to straighten up. You have to left foot brake but using light to moderate brake pressure while keeping the throttle wide open can keep a car's angle around a long corner your car doesn't have the raw power for. At our last event of the year we had a long right hand turn that basically hooked back in on itself very quickly at the end. So I had to throw the car in and then keep my right foot pegged while modulating my left, which allowed me to have minimal steering movements, and then move my right foot over to full on braking and heal-toe downshift to 2nd to make the end of the corner. Definitely make sure you practice your foot techniques when you can it'll mean less steering wheel movement and better looking drifts."
Drifting,2rses4,Shinny1337,2,Fri Jan 9 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great explanation. I'm pretty familiar with left foot braking from Ice racing and rally racing, I just never knew how to apply it to drifting, I hope this helps me. Do you only use Heel-toe when you are down shifting, while keeping your rotation while slowing and needing the power to finish the drift?"
Drifting,2rses4,VINNY240SX,3,Fri Jan 9 18:00:56 2015 UTC,Correct there are time you can simple downshift the regular way if you're doing it going into a slower corner and you've got the momentum. But usually mid-corner downshifts need to be heel-toed. Sounds like you're like I was coming from rallycross. Having the experice of using a cars weight to go fast will give you a good jumping off point for drifting.
Drifting,2rses4,frsh2fourty,2,Fri Jan 9 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome, Once I learned how to throw the weight around in rally and rallycross, I have been unstoppable, but now drifting, I haven't figured it out as good as the other disciplines, but I got motivation and just looking for the knowledge part."
Drifting,2rses4,rheadtdeirt,3,Fri Jan 9 19:57:18 2015 UTC,Yeah its a little different if you weren't doing RWD in the rally stuff. The combination of putting power down and using momentum is more in favor of power on tarmac.
Drifting,2rq12a,autoHQ,9,Thu Jan 8 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"Easiest method, try with car off first to get motions down so youre not standing on the limiter constantly:   -Clutch in.   -Select first gear.   -Throttle to floor. Keep it there for now.   -Abruptly release clutch, hell just slip your foot off to the side and let it pop up (side step) if youre worried about burning the clutch up.   -Move clutch foot to brake pedal quickly, but don't stuff the brakes to the floor. You'll have to just get a feel for this part with practice.   -Modulate throttle and brake so youre not constantly banging the limiter, and you can start getting a feel for how the car behaves with more/less brake/throttle.   Enjoy!"
Drifting,2rq12a,rapturedjesus,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"This one.  If you have power and a strong drivetrain you can slam second, then third, for increased wheel speed smokey awesomeness. Not recommended for hooptie's and novices however."
Drifting,2rq12a,thetimechaser,8,Thu Jan 8 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"Fill up on gas, find used tires to kill, go somewhere safe and quiet and play. It will come to you. Balance is kind of a reflex, you must do it wrong to know what corrections to make."
Drifting,2rq12a,onomaxristi,6,Thu Jan 8 10:57:15 2015 UTC,"It depends how much power you have, but usually start in first (definitely not second!), rev the engine with the clutch in to about 5-6000 rpm and drop the clutch. Quickly move your left foot onto the brake (softly at first) while keeping your foot flat on the accelerator and progressively brake more  as the car tries to pull away. Let the car crawl forward slowly so the rear brakes dont load the engine down too much. If you are feeling adventurous, shift to second after a few secs of limit in first and repeat the process. You are right about the drivetrain bit, cars typically hate this kind of driving so I wouldn't recommend it. Imo I would stick to drifting, where you can throw your car into a corner to make it break traction rather than rely on clutch dumps/kicks.  Just dont forget the car will crabwalk and you will still have to countersteer even while doing a slow braketorch, so be aware of where the car is moving and countersteer appropriately. Also, don't do it on public roads as its a dick move and is actually pretty dangerous if you are inexperienced. Don't feel peer pressured into doing it, like you say it's just a waste of time unless you are heating your tyres for some sr20de drifting action."
Drifting,2rq12a,Chillzz,6,Thu Jan 8 11:01:56 2015 UTC,But clutch kicks are fun around corners on the way to work :(
Drifting,2rq12a,HeyVitaminK,2,Thu Jan 8 13:12:38 2015 UTC,And are still sometimes necessary drifting even a high power car.   Low power car...a clutch kick is used a lot lol.
Drifting,2rq12a,ShadynastyS14,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"any particular reason you warn against 2nd?  all the burnouts i've done that were worth doing were done in 2nd gear. As long as you're 100% confident that the wheels will break traction, I've found it completely fine. And significantly easier than trying to shift from 1st to 2nd mid burnout. This is with a 2JZ-GE + W58 in MA61 celica supra, standard (or possibly very slightly uprated) clutch, standard LSD/shafts and I was actually trying to finish off a set of Federal 595 RSR semi's, although only 205/50R15 so not particularly wide.  unfortunately my clutch didnt want anything to do with 3rd gear on the spot :( next time gadget..."
Drifting,2rq12a,phatty47,2,Tue Jan 13 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"It's not the fact it wont work (because it will if you give it enough juice) but the fact it puts even more stress on the drivetrain than first. It depends though, like you say cars with strong standard (possibly overengineered) components it can be fine, just not really worth the risk.  Minimizing the initial impact will reduce the chances of destroying something without stopping you from that sweet second gear+ limit. Its more of a do it at your own risk sort of thing imo i guess"
Drifting,2rq12a,Chillzz,2,Tue Jan 13 05:05:46 2015 UTC,fair enough. I definitely wouldnt recommend it in something like an AE86 or MX-5.  but if you have the torque to dump 2nd gear straight up I say do it every time _^
Drifting,2rq12a,phatty47,2,Tue Jan 13 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"Rip up on that ebrake and pow, wait. What are you asking about again?"
Drifting,2rq12a,Shinny1337,-6,Thu Jan 8 14:02:28 2015 UTC,Ya put your left foot in you put your right foot in take your left foot out and you spin your wheels all about. More specifically yo put your foot on the brake all the way rev the motor will pushing the clutch down (not long tho) then dump the clutch if it slides to one way take some breke pre sure off so you move forward a bit to straighten out the back on the brakes or just deal with the back end moving a little

Drifting,2r5w2u,JayHTea,3,Sat Jan 3 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"The current day scene that you are watching in the footage in the trailer is touge drifting, you're right. But aside from the fact that the drifters are not actually racing each other, verything else is the actual real-life counterpart to Initial D like the exact same location.   However, last week I did an interview with a man who was a Pro drifter here in Japan and he told me that when he was younger and still honing his skills on the touge, people actually raced each other and had rivalries. His exact words were ""yes, it really was just like in Initial D"".   Part of my mission with this documentary is to find out if that aspect of underground drifting culture in Japan still exists:)"
Drifting,2r5w2u,JayHTea,1 point,Sat Jan 3 04:58:11 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, I see. So it's more about location? Drifting is slower around the corners but it's useful if you're against someone so you can block them from passing. Did the man you interview say he used that technique when he was racing? I've heard rivalries are serious in Southern California when it comes to the mountains. Not so much here in Northern California as far as I've seen.   Well hopefully you finish and get enough for your documentary, I would actually like to see some racing if you are deep into the mountain scene."

I mean, it's not like The Fast and the Furious and Need For Speed reflects reality with real racing through crowded public streets.  My point is I just don't want you to be disappointed in the doc if I don't get footage of racing the way it's depicted in Initial D. I'll do my best to create a cool documentary about the underground drifting scene here where I live in Japan tho. I hope you check it out! Subscribe to my channel for updates.

Drifting,2r5w2u,psw1994,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:11:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would be disappointed if you showed racing the way it's depicted in initial D because it's not really like that in real life. I mean they do race but drifting is for the drifters. People do race in mountains in SoCal as well as here in NorCal but I don't see anyone drifting while racing because it makes you slower.   I think it's cool what you're doing, just make it real and try not be like F&F or NFS. Or do whatever because it's your documentary lol."
Drifting,2r5w2u,Eightninethree,2,Sat Jan 3 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"Goodpoint, thanks!  That's really cool that people actually race each other in the mountains in Cali. I wish someone would make a documentary about THAT!   Like the pro scene is cool and all, but what I really want to see is Vice style coverage of real underground subcultures. That's what I'm hoping to do with Drift Hunter. So yeah, don't worry I intend to show what the grassroots scene here in the 田舎 (inaka, meaning countryside) is really like, as I experience it.  Thanks again for the support and comments bro."
Drifting,2r5w2u,MrKnister95,1 point,Sat Jan 3 07:55:30 2015 UTC,Have you thought about contacting Speedhunters for help? They might be interested considering how great the footage you already have is
Drifting,2r5w2u,AfroDrift,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:02:42 2015 UTC,"Hey yup, I've been working really hard to reach out to blogs like Speedhunters, canibeat, nor inari, various car and drifting blogs, but it's been pretty rough going. But I've also met some other local guys who have some connections so I'm hoping to tap into those, and also I might be able to get a feature on a Jalopnik..I've been grinding really hard at it so hopefully something will click. Help me out with a shout on facebook or Twitter or Instagram please!"
Drifting,2r6umk,SirTenderBeard,2,Sat Jan 3 08:39:51 2015 UTC,Dude is your miata turbo? Specifically the red one
Drifting,2r6umk,whyitsdone,2,Sat Jan 10 04:26:20 2015 UTC,The grey shark car was but that has been sold. The red was a stock 1.6 motor with coilovers and welded diff. Sliding naturally aspirated miatas is fun.

Drifting,2qx33v,Dmaac,3,Wed Dec 31 13:54:33 2014 UTC,"It'll work. I forget specifics but you want a steering rack if it's still the box. Convert it to manual, lock the diff or get an LSD, go have some skids."
Drifting,2qx33v,protomor,2,Wed Dec 31 13:57:24 2014 UTC,Cheers m8!
Drifting,2qx33v,Shinny1337,2,Wed Dec 31 14:00:57 2014 UTC,If you're really eager to get out drifting I would even say diff before transmission. Automatics can be drifted I've seen it done. Just select 2nd gear and have skids. But obviously a manual is much much better
Drifting,2qx33v,b_deam,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:31:37 2014 UTC,"Agreed, saw a auto Mark II sliding at Final Bout, did just fine."
Drifting,2qx33v,Beastydrummer,0,Thu Jan 1 06:50:48 2015 UTC,I've drifted my truck... (6K lb diesel crew cab).. It's possible... But a pain in the butt haha
Drifting,2qx33v,dapperfiziks,3,Wed Dec 31 15:03:10 2014 UTC,"The e39 is a heavy bitch and full of electronics. In the i6 models the power to weight, even when fully stripped is mediocre at best. A manual swap is complex not a weekend affair. And a m3 S/C wont simply bolt right up. Diff is open. Consumables on the e39 chassis are expensive and also complex.  I advise you to sell it and look for a earlier year bmw if you want to stick with that brand. E34, e30, etc."
Drifting,2qx33v,RandomHero27,2,Wed Dec 31 21:36:27 2014 UTC,"upvoted for truth. the m52 is a great motor but the 5 series was a luxery car and full of electronics. hell, my 328 is full of electronics and heated power seats. also this particular 528 is OBDII, and the ECU has a built in anti theft. if he swaps to a manual trans, the ECU he gets for the manual trans will not match the transponder on the ignition, so there is an extra $250 to send your ECU out to get the EWS disabled.   heres the good thing though, OP should sell the5 series, and just move right onto a manual e36 for whatever he gets from the 5, should be no trouble at all."
Drifting,2qx33v,eLetoR,2,Thu Jan 1 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input mate, now if only someone wanted to buy this thing..."
Drifting,2qx33v,anfeline,3,Fri Jan 2 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"I would say sell it and buy a E30/36 thats manual already, if you like BMW and budget is an issue. There is a great aftermarket for these older cars, including some awesome steering angle kits. The free'd up cash would help you get out on the track in a proper set up with money to spare. Good luck!"
