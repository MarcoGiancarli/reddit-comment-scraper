ECE,3e6e4n,newbieEE22,9,Wed Jul 22 08:38:40 2015 UTC,"Basically it won't produce any energy. It will produce a voltage at the leads but no current will flow until you apply an electrical load.   As there is no current flowing the engine will find it very easy to turn the generator, it just has to overcome friction and windage losses. Once you draw current from the generator it will apply a torque which has to be overcome by the engine. The engine should be equipped with a governor which adjusts the throttle to maintain a constant rpm.  Try it yourself with a small permanent magnet DC motor - the shaft is easy to turn but if you short the leads together it is much harder to spin the shaft."
ECE,3e6e4n,Slipalong_Trevascas,2,Wed Jul 22 09:48:22 2015 UTC,"Then, to simulate different ""loads"", you can try putting different valued resistors across the leads, and note the differences in difficulty of turning the shaft."

ECE,3e4ccw,VoltageRegulator,15,Tue Jul 21 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"First, just drop the issue with your BS degree being non-EE. That's overridden by your MSEE, especially since you've been working as an EE. Don't bring that up, and don't allow anybody else to bring it up.  It's always a trick to find salary info. There's no clear data, and it varies a lot by industry and location. The midwest is generally known for lower salaries.  I would think in your situation a bump of 10 - 20% might be expected, but the economy is a little flat now, so who knows."

I included the information about my BS just to clarify why I didn't feel that I could negotiate very much prior to completing the MSEE (because I felt I was slightly underqualified for the position and my employment was somewhat contingent upon my completing a graduate degree).  I appreciate your input."

I agree with /u/1wiseguy, your BS is irrelevant, you were employed in the field and they liked you enough to keep you employed. You have an MS in the field now.  Generally speaking, I find that an MS gives about 10-20% more than a BS in EE. Not a lot. The math generally works out so that if you did an MS for two years, full time, instead of working, your salary increase after graduation would let you - over your expected working career - to make up the two years of not getting paid or advancing - and then come out ahead, but not by much.  In other words, a lot of jobs might offer $70k for a person with a BS or $80k for an MS.  Also, let them make the first offer if possible, but don't let yourself be bullied, especially not by some bullshit like ""weak economy blah blah.""

However, as /u/1wiseguy said, the tuition assistance was independent of compensation arrangements, and will not be a factor in any negotiations.  Something else I meant to mention in my initial post is that I'm wondering whether my 3 years of experience with this company could be considered more valuable to them since I'm fully ""integrated,"" know all the processes and product lines and designs, etc.  I appreciate all the feedback."

In an optimal case (no load on the transformer, and no losses), the reverse voltage will happen to be exactly what the primary applied voltage is, and thus no real current actually flows.

ECE,3e4kyn,psycoee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"While the secondary load plays a role, in that its impedance is reflected, that's not the primary reason. The primary reason is given to us in Maxwell's equations. A current induces a magnetic field, which in turn, as it oscillates with the AC current, induces an opposing current. These opposing currents work to effectively introduce impedance into the primary. This is also why inductors (which is what one side of a transformer is) offer higher impedance at higher frequencies. Additionally, it's all dependent on the presence of the transformer's core, since if you remove that, you remove the electromagnetic aspect and create a short (since there is no longer a magnetic field inducing significant enough current)."
ECE,3e4kyn,ByNaughtButGrace,-16,Wed Jul 22 04:52:24 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to the resistance. Remember Ohm's law:  V=IR So if V = 15,000, the transformer primary would have to have a resistance of 5000 ohms."
ECE,3e4kyn,Charleston_atmega,16,Tue Jul 21 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect. The windings of a transformer don't have anywhere near a 5kOhm resistance. What happens is that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field. As the current flows through the wires, this magnetic field expands and collapses with the change in direction of the alternating current. We know from Maxwell's equations that the direction of this magnetic field always opposes the direction of the current. Since a changing magnetic field introduces an electric current and since the generated field is in the opposite direction of the supplied current, you have these two forces in opposition which creates an impedance to the supplied current. Futhermore, the load on the secondary wiring is also reflected back and appears as a further impedance to the driving power supply.  tl, dr: Electricity and magnetism are linked. Transformers are also electromagnets. Use Maxwell's laws, not (just) Ohms law."

Among indoor antennas you'll still find differences in reception related to amplified vs. unamplified, size, build quality etc.   In your case you may be able to pick up everything you want with a $20 antenna, it depends how close you are, but if you spend more, you will likely be able to pick up stations further away."

I have a coat hanger antenna (1.5 feet across, 2 feet long) that I put together for ~$10.  It's in an elevated position in the garage.  Signal is amplified by a crap $10 amplifier that came with tiny crap RCA antenna - it did help (about a 50 foot run).  Collecting parts and finding a spot for the antenna are the hardest parts.  Construction was easy.  Elevation and antenna SIZE are key.  Larger antennas tend to perform better in a good location.  Said coat hanger antenna was terrible next to TV.  bunny ears antenna in the elevated position was terrible.  coat hanger antenna in elevation position works GREAT.

ECE,3e55ev,runxctry,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"The performance of an antenna entirely depends on the design. Just paying more money for a particular combination of wires is not going to improve things. Physics doesn't care.  Note that indoor TV reception involves trying to pick a signal out of a mish-mash of reflections and refractions. That is mostly because such antennas are relatively close to the ground (where all the obstructions are). As a result there is no real science of indoor reception. What works in one case will not work in another. This situation attracts snake oil salesmen. Most of the currently most popular indoor antennas are , in terms of design, complete BS. Slap some random conductors in a nice looking enclosure and you are good to go.  For outdoor antennas you are mostly paying for weather proofing."
ECE,3e55ev,upofadown,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:48:52 2015 UTC,"Do the laws of physics matter?  There probably is a difference but it depends on the field strength where you are.  If you are already close to the transmitter, even a piece of wire might be enough.  If you are in a more marginal area, a better antenna will make a difference.  Digital television has the particular challenge of ""thresholding"" far more than analog TV or analog radio: when you come to the edge of the critical signal-to-noise level of reception, the reception will drop out very suddenly in contrast to how analog just fades to oblivion.  It's this fringe that may well matter a great deal."
ECE,3e4lhs,fdbk,3,Tue Jul 21 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"Might belong better in /r/chipdesign   My experience is the following: I just started (and quickly quit) a board level analog design job because I found it to be void of any actual circuit design 96% of the time. Most of the job was just pushing papers and checking adherence to standards, risk analysis, etc. A senior designer I talked to at the company confessed to me that only perhaps 4% of their career was spent doing, ""real creative design"", as he put it.    What he described is probably what the EE industry is like for most people in it without a PhD.  I've interned at a very big EE IC company after my undergrad freshmen year.  Being a newbie at that time, I wasn't really happy but I didn't know exactly why I wasn't happy.  Talked to my manager, he also confessed that most of the work is corporate-related crap.  Talked to some PhD interns, and they told me design (the ""4%"") is only done by those with advanced degrees and backgrounds.  I was pretty traumatized from that summer because I learned nothing and spend the whole summer pushing buttons on a machine.  I'm now aiming to stay strictly in research, get PhD, and probably become research professor.  I won't be going back into industry again for a while.   Another bad sign that I encountered, and something I'd like compared to life at an IC place, was that cracking open a circuit simulator was seen as something that was a rare treat. In fact, walking around the place I don't think I ever saw one open. When I opened one it gathered a lot of attention and even received a few comments about how I was lucky and how I should enjoy it while it lasts. All of this at a place full of people with ""design engineer"" in their title. In contrast, in my one experience interviewing at a semiconductor company I saw simulators open everywhere, and overheard many discussions that were technical in nature and exciting.   ""Cracking a circuit simulator open""?  You mean dissecting the code of PSPICE or Cadence ADE?  Or automated test equipment and IC handlers that test IC's by the masses?   I'd like to make sure that IC design is actually what I am hoping it is. Maybe I'm just spoiled and disillusioned with what actual work entails. I'm open to that criticism. But maybe there are enjoyable design jobs out there, and maybe they're just at the silicon level.   Maybe what you're describing is the distinction between industry and research (academia, in most senses).  It doesnt matter if you're doing PCB or IC design.  Industry is basically a ""customers first"" world; a lot of copy and pasting and ""don't fix whats not broken"" mentality is common.  Research is all about innovation and for the sake of knowledge, understanding, and discovery.  Lets say you're tasked to design a VCO to meet certain specifications.  In the industry, chances are the specs are relatively easy to meet unless you're involved in the research branch of the company.  Your boss would just be like ""copy the VCO from the previous chip"".  In the field of research, chances are the specs would be a step up from the previous milestone, otherwise its not research.  This is where innovation and ""real creative design"" comes into play.  This is what distinguishes ""electrical engineers"" from ""circuit designers"".  To me, personally, circuit design is best understood as a form of art.  Coming form a research perspective, let me try to answer your questions:  1) A lot.  Chip mfg is very expensive and so its almost always ""required"" to get the design right the first time, otherwise bad things will happen.  You'll be solely in simulation mode during designing your chip.  During the dead time between sending it for fabrication and receiving it back, you'll be dissecting your specs and simulation data.  During the testing of your chip, you'll be simulating even more to cross-check actual performance vs simulated performance.  Finally, when you write and publish a paper, you'll be parsing your simulating data and plotting them alongside with your measured data.  2) I've only had one tapeout so far.  Since you're doing something new (""real creative design"") i.e. where nothing is known, to me it feels like one project is actually two projects.  The first is actual design, the second is ""how the hell do I measure this"".  Measuring is not as easy as it may sound, especially when you're working with complete circuits and signal chains.  It is important to constantly be thinking of how to measure your chip while you design it and how parasitics of the test setup effect your results.  3) Your meetings will typically be with professors.  Yes, very technical in nature.  If you have a good professor, you'll get the occasional ""oh fuck I'm in deep hot water"" feeling.  4) Never.  5) Yes.  Part of my project required to design a PCB to interface with my chip, to allow for testing.  Think of chip-level design as working more with geometries, symmetry, 3-D manipulations, and etc compared to PCB level 2-D design.  6) Depends on your particular project, or group project.  You might need to know about things like biology and chemistry if your chip is supposed to do something with those.  7) Only when I'm super fucking pissed at the company who mis-wirebonded several of my chips.  Since you say you plan on doing grad school, I would suggest the typical 4 year masters w/ research to get the full experience.  Then you have an option of going into PhD if you like research, or go back into industry.  More info from another reply"

Be aware, though- going into IC with a BS (and often even an MS) usually puts you in verification for the beginning of your career, which means a lot of time with simulators but not much with design.   The reason behind this is that it costs tens of thousands and sometimes more to revise an IC. A PCB costs orders of magnitude less to do a design iteration.   As for lab time, most of it is left to test engineers save for some certain cases. The designers will work to build the tests and diagnose issues, but the actual lab work belongs to test"

ECE,3e0tba,DogManBountyMan,42,Tue Jul 21 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'm livid right now, because I had like a two page comment typed up on my phone then goddam BaconReader crashed and I lost it all. But I'll try again from my laptop, but I'll have to be a bit more brief.   Analog distortions, classically an overdriven vacuum tube, exhibit some characteristics that are considered ""pleasant"" and ""musical"" (of course, subjectively): there's natural compression of the signal, there's asymmetric clipping, where the top half of the wave is clipped more than the bottom half, and there's a tendency of popular tube amps to emphasize odd-order harmonics. Different tube amp topologies distort in different ways, so I'm definitely generalizing, but that's just a few things. Popular analog distortions, such as the Tubescreamer, try and emulate the ""tube sound"" by implementing asymmetric clipping, emphasizing odd-order harmonics, etc. This is all fairly simple to do in analog space, especially in a ""low-fi"" way typical of guitar gear. In fact, some other famous distortions, like the ProCo Rat, only sound the way they do because the opamps used to drive them are so crappy--the slew rate is so low by hifi standards on the opamps used in the original Rats that the opamp itself works as a kind of bandpass filter, that is a big influence on its tone. This is why modders love chip-swapping their Rats, and why collectors pay crazy prices on eBay for rats with the original, long-out-of-production opamps used in the first generation Rat pedals. The biggest upside to these simple analog circuits is that even the more complex analog distortions only require something like $10 worth of components (excluding enclosure, hardware, etc--just the circuit itself).   These unique aspects of the ""analog sound"" if given adequate computing power and with an excellently developed algorithm, digital distortion can sound quite good, as evidenced by some of the excellent digital sounds found in some VST plugins or top-shelf digital modeling equipment. Thing is, to get that good of digital tone right now you either need a lot of power (like your desktop running Logic) or expensive hardware (your $1500 Boss rackmount modeling stuff, etc). Most digital distortions people are used to in the guitar world are neither--they're Line 6 Spiders, or Digitech floorboards, that were built to a price point that just isn't going to match the tone and responsiveness of an analog circuit, but has the advantage of hundreds of programmable tones.   You mention delays, etc. Digital delays are pretty straightfoward: an ADC on the input, a RAM chip, and a DAC on the output that repeats the input signal a set number of times, and a mixer to mix dry and wet. Reverb and chorus are basically the same as a delay, but with some modifications, which is why a lot of chorus pedals can be modded into basic delays and vice versa. Analog delays, on the other hand, basically create the analog equivalent of a RAM chip and ADC, and use a big bank of capacitors to sample the signal as a sequence of analog voltages stored on the caps (these are known as ""bucket brigade devices"", and are cool to read about). This means that delay time is linearly proportional with the number of capacitors, and signal is continually deteriorated--why analog delays lose fidelity with each repeat, and why you never see analog delays with a long delay time, and almost never see an analog reverb in a pedal: it'd be needlessly complex and expensive to make one, when a spring reverb or digital reverb would both sound better and cost less.   So, someday there will be cheap consumer digital multipedals that sound pretty much just as good as your Big Muff. But you'll never see an all-digital, single pedal Big Muff, because an actual big muff can be built for so cheap.   Disclaimer: I'm just a self-taught enthusiast and DIY pedalbuilder, so take this all with a grain of salt re: the actual science and shit."
ECE,3e0tba,disgruntled_soviet,7,Tue Jul 21 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome response. I just want to add one thing.  The reason we consider the analog sound to be pleasant is because we have been conditioned this way. For the first few decades that electric guitar music was popular we didn't have solid-state amplifiers. We grew accustomed to hearing electric guitars amplified with tube amps. It's all we ever knew, so when solid-state amps came around lacking the analog characteristics of tube amps it sounded harsh and cold. There isn't anything intrinsically bad about the sound of a digital amp, it's just not what the world is accustomed to hearing.  Distortion pedals attempt to recreate the sound of tube amps. All digital distortions are relatively cheap digital attempts to recreate analog sound."

ECE,3e0tba,johnaldmcgee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"Tangent on digital/analog just because it came to mind:  Also, bucket brigade isn't conventionally analog, i.e. continuous time AND continuous value. It's discrete time continuous value. The sampling represents the original data exactly up to half the sample frequency (e.g. 40kHz sampling can represent a signal up to but excluding 20kHz). That half frequency is called the Nyquist frequency.   When I say exactly, I mean EXACTLY. Not ""is humanly indistinguishable"", not ""approximately to within a high tolerance"". Mathematical exactness.   But that assumes the original signal that is sampled had NO energy at higher frequencies than that, otherwise you get aliasing (high frequencies wrap around to low frequencies). So you have added ""stuff"" in addition to your signal with aliasing.   If you take the sampled signal (as a staircase voltage signal), and pass it through a brick wall filter at 20kHz, you get your exact signal back! Again, exact: some frequency domain analysis in the continuous time domain can be used to prove that.   Now, factor in that you can't filter out 20kHz with a brickwall filter in real life, either at the beginning to anti-alias or at the end to recover the signal. (Guess where 44.1kHz came from?)  All of this assumes an ideal discrete time sampling, of course. Level degradation with bucket brigades will degrade the recovered signal at the end.   The difference between that and digital is that digital quantises the signal levels. Discrete time, as in bucket brigades, allow any voltage value on each sample. Digital limits the values: 8 bit digital means you have 255 values, and have to map voltages to those 25 values somehow (can be linear, which is actually a somewhat poor choice, or non linear). But it forces you to choose 255 specific values, and round every sample value to that one. That's destructive to your signal, although with enough bit depth (relates to number of values) it won't be perceptible. Quantisation noise is the ""noise"" you have to add to round each of the original sample values to the nearest digital value."

However, the opamps I tend to use in distortions are 0V/+9V, or single rail supply up to probably 18V, but probably work on a bipolar supply. The TL0xx series is popular in guitar work, the NOS JRC4558 is the tube screamer holy grail, but the modern NJM4558 works just as well and sound just as good imo. Honestly, that's pretty much the only opamps I'm experienced extensively with, but the older TL062 and TL072 are hard to go wrong with (the 082 being ""too hifi""), but the beauty of those old analog distortions is that literally any opamp will do, and picking one you like is half the fun"

ECE,3e0tba,disgruntled_soviet,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:49:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll take at those. And yes, an opamp that can take a 10V rail-to-rail supply voltage can handle ±5V dual or +10V single supply. The problem with single supply is that non-rail-to-rail opamps can't get anywhere close to zero volts output, and any bipolar signals need to be DC biased. I guess pedals tend to work with single supply out of necessity of operational simplicity, though.  A lot of newer precision opamps can only do 6V or ±3V, hence why I mentioned ±5V. Wasn't really expecting you to bring those up, as they're usually hard limiters and very poor for distortion, but figured I'd mention it to be safe!    Dual in-line package. DIP8 photograph  Other packages for ICs include SIP (rare for microelectronics, common for power electronics) and SMD (surface-mount) packages (note: SO is often SOIC, to distinguish from SOT - small-outline transistor).  Obviously, surface mount parts aren't very nice to give to people to play with at a workshop. Can't breadboard them unless we solder them onto a breakout board first."
ECE,3e0tba,Laogeodritt,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:30:37 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah DIP...it all makes sense now.   Electrosmash has breakdowns of several popular distortion circuits, if find the link but mobile. But they have the fuzz face (two transistor NPN fuzz), the tube screamer (opamp distortion with asymmetric diode clipping and a distinct mid-boost EQ), the Rat (an opamp distortion that typically used non-audio designed opamps), and the MXR D+, another opamp driven diode clipped distortion that is still very distinct from the tube screamer.   Personally, some of my favorite circuits are from electro-harmonix (a pedal brand), as they not only have some great circuits but frequently swapped discrete transistor circuits for opamp circuits--for instance, the famous Big Muff has both transistor and opamp versions, but my personal favorite it's the Muff Fuzz, a circuit that in both its transistor and opamp versions is very simplistic, sounds great, and yet distinct between the two versions"
ECE,3e0tba,disgruntled_soviet,7,Wed Jul 22 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"I'd hazard a guess that (cheap) processing power is a factor. Simulating non-linear distortion requires the calculation of, say, an exponential every sample. That can be very FPU intensive and a 16-bit look up table might also be too memory intensive (although 64K of ROM isn't a big deal nowadays, so maybe this is possible but isn't done for other reasons).  Then again it might just be that there's not enough demand to make a quality DSP distortion sound marketable."
ECE,3e0tba,VK2DDS,8,Tue Jul 21 02:26:11 2015 UTC,The extra harmonics generated from clipping the waveform can also exceed the sample rate and cause intermodulation distortion.

It blew my mind how simple it made everything while sounding so real.

A tiny microcontroller; all it does is send a PWM signal to control the LED's duty cycle, and gets data from the temperature sensor.   For the code, all you do is basically  loop forever:     get temperature from sensor     find the difference between current and target temp     adjust PWM based on the difference     wait a little   You can probably get a microcontroller with built in temperature sensors for this, just put 'em close by."

I guess $ budget doesn't really matter as much if its the difference between 50 cents and 2 cents when there is going to be a $50 battery in there as well. As for space, I'm not strictly limited, but I would probably want to go with whatever option takes up the least space. It's going to be a wrist mounted flashlight with a cable going off to the battery, so the goal is to keep weight and size to a minimum.  Do you have anything in mind when you say 1 cents worth of resistors and diodes? Any searches I make for thermal management usually just tell me to add an emitter resistor to the BJT.

Hook the output to a analog in pin to read it out. You'll need to calibrate it though.  No need to buy the i2c temp sensor if you do not want to.
ECE,3e1pxv,1wiseguy,4,Wed Jul 22 06:39:52 2015 UTC,"You use a constant current supply.    The simply (but not fool-proof) method is a resistor.  The problem is it doesn't give you good current regulation over temperature.  Works OK in a temperature-controlled environment (e.g. indoors only).  The better method is to use a switch mode current regulator, which is what pretty much all ""LED regulator ICs"" are about.  Basically you stack a bunch of LEDs in series and thanks to KCL you only need to regulate the current on the supply side for all of them.  Generally you want to use current regulation rather than voltage regulation because of the diode equation combined with the tendency of III-V materials in LEDs having a positive temperature coefficient which leads to current hogging and thermal runaway.   Especially NEVER connect LEDs in parallel unless you minimally have separate resistors (or current mode regulators) on every parallel leg!  You can get away with abusing them with no regulation or parallel connections but the lifetime of the LEDs will be reduced.  Sometimes radically by orders of magnitude of time."

ECE,3dwypp,stealth_inc,2,Mon Jul 20 14:20:47 2015 UTC,"ABET isn't even questioned if the school is known. Still I would be cautious of UCSD. I have interviewed many CE students from UCSD for embedded system internships. Overall they seem unprepared for real world engineering. I have found more ""ready to work"" talent out of SDSU than UCSD. I highly recommend being involved in a few personal projects if you choose UCSD.  It has between a few years since I have interviewed UCSD students but there was an obvious lack of challenging individual projects assigned by the department. It almost seemed like they were being groomed for grad school or the teachers were afraid to apply proper academic pruning of the engineering class."

I have no way of knowing for sure, but I am fairly certain the circuit in the video you posted below does not use a microcontroller to accomplish what you see. It looks more like the circuit is using an op-amp or other small IC to drive the circuit using analog signals. I think the video is tagged as ""microcontroller"" to get more views.  If you've never interfaced a microphone with a circuit before I would look up some information on microphone design, as well as the nature of analog signals.

You need to make an amplifier to boost the signal to somewhere around 2v pk-pk with a DC bias of around 2.5v (assuming Vref = 5v). Let's say you come up with such a circuit.  All you then need to do is connect it to a high impedance ADC pin on a micro controller and start sampling at around ~40kHz. Check the converted output:      out = read_adc();     if (out > (VBIAS+Vlimit) || (out < (VBIAS-Vlimit) )         led_on();     else         led_off();   In the led_on() and led_off() functions, you can use timers to make sure that the led is lit for at least a certain a certain amount of time."

The comparator output feeds into a 555 monostable which controls the led.  Easy, but there are some annoying things. Once you add the cost of a trimpot, 555 timer, and a 358 opamp you are over the cost of a small AVR microcontroller (which has an integrated gandgap ref and ADC). These are single quantity prices from digikey. You still need to take into account the cost of passives, of which there will be more for the strictly analog circuit.  I am sure there is probably a better way to do it but for a one off simple project, I can't see too much of a downside to using a microcontroller."

ECE,3drtwr,ecehelpneeded,3,Sat Jul 18 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"I work with a lot of ADCs and can help slightly for you.  In the past the idea was to keep analog and digital completely separate.  BUT the grounds have to be common at some point, and thus the idea was to connect the analog ground to the digital ground at a single point with a low impedance resistor.  Typically away from the digital and analog sections to keep noise to a minimum.  More current approach is to use one uniform ground and separate the analog and digital components by physical layout.  This is possible since the decay of the noise on a ground plane is the square of the distance.  For home development and testing, I'd do method #1 since that is what most ADC vendors recommend (TI has a good paper on this).  Plus if you're wire wrapping, or other type of layout instead of PCB it seems easier.  As for your question, I'd say put the voltage divider to analog ground, not digital.  Good luck."
ECE,3drtwr,CylonGlitch,2,Sat Jul 18 23:24:16 2015 UTC,More current approach is to use one uniform ground and separate the analog and digital components by physical layout.    I agree with that. I don't know any other practical way to do it.

ECE,3drtwr,CylonGlitch,2,Sun Jul 19 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Your front end of the circuit (up to the ADC) should not have the 3.3v being used.  If it is, something isn't right.  The goal is to get the analog signal into the digital domain as quickly as possible so that there is less opportunity for noise.    You can run the ADC off of the 3.3v, but read the specs, make sure that it has an internal reference that conditions the 3.3v line.  Even if it does, it will be no where near as accurate as an external reference designed specifically for that purpose.  No matter what, you want to make sure that the 3.3v line is as clean and noise free as possible.  You don't want that noise to couple into measurements.  If you're building a PCB, layout is critical, no matter how much you've designed the circuitry to be noise free, a bad layout can destroy that.  No parallel lines, no mixing of digital and analog circuits, isolation of at least 30 mils between analog and digital.  etc..  Sounds like a fun project, hope it all turns out good for you.  Good luck."

The signal will be about -1.5v to 1.5v and Ill need to translate it to 0-3v before feeding it to the ADC.

There are options but it's a pain in the butt to do right.  You have the same voltage range so what you need to do is to shift your range so that the -3v is ground.   Now, to do that without causing noise on the ground lines; may be some issue.  Not sure what to tell you, how about a differential opamp as your input to the ADC."

This is possible since the decay of the noise on a ground plane is the square of the distance.   I agree, but it's not that it's a newer, ""more current"" approach. Physics hasn't changed, nor has the constraints of printed circuit board design. The EMI gurus (see http://learnemc.com/emc-tutorials for example) will recommend a uniform ground. I have heard (can't find it, though) that separation of grounds, if done properly, is appropriate for precision ADCs (16-bit and greater) in order to keep digital noise from affecting acquisition quality. Wish I could find a good reference for that. But that's the exception rather than the rule...

What if you have more than one ADC, or other stuff that uses analog and digital ground?  If you're connecting analog and digital ground together, then they're actually the same net in the circuit, and it's just a layout thing. To call them by different names means you're trying to describe the ground layout in a single sentence, rather than actually keeping track of it yourself. Good luck with that."
ECE,3drtwr,hardolaf,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"In order to figure out how to configure your grounds, it is first necessary to understand why chips have two ground pins in the first place.  The reason is basically that interconnections on a chip tend to be pretty resistive, because the metallization is quite thin.  Thus, if a single ground pin is provided, both digital and analog currents will return through this pin; because of the resistance, the circuits inside the chip will see the IR drop from the digital currents, and you will get crosstalk.  On a PCB, resistance is almost entirely negligible, and the issue is instead parasitic inductance.  The best way to minimize inductance is to provide a nice, solid ground plane under all of your conductors such that the return current can stay directly under each conductor.  The only remaining issue is that digital current pulses can spread out on the ground plane, inducing a voltage drop between analog reference points.  Thus, it is commonly advised to add cuts to the ground plane between analog and digital sections to minimize current spreading.  This needs to be done carefully, because you don't want to add inductance (which is by far the most important consideration).  In general, if your PCB has clearly defined analog and digital sections, it's fine to separate the grounds and connect them directly underneath the data converter chip.  If you do this, you must make sure that there are no signal traces or chip packages crossing this gap.  Since this is difficult to achieve in most designs, it is now commonly advised to not bother with this and to use a single, solid ground plane."
ECE,3drtwr,psycoee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"I design scientific equipment for very low noise applications (think measuring fA) and as long as the analog traces are well separated by a power plane from the digital traces even if the analog parts are not completely separated from digital traces, you will usually have noise that is usually not measurable by your ADC at low frequencies (<100 MHz), i.e. the noise from the ADC itself will be much greater than the noise on the analog traces."
ECE,3drtwr,hardolaf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say it depends entirely on the frequencies you care about, and whether strong magnetic fields are present.  The worst analog problems I've dealt with involved switching converters coupling into single-ended analog circuits on a small-ish PCB.  There, putting the converter on its own peninsula definitely helped, because it confined the large, high-frequency currents into a localized area.    This is mainly an issue with systems where you are sensitive to spurs sticking out of the noise.  There, you may need extremely low levels of coupling, because your noise bandwidth can be very small, and so even a tone that's way below the quantization noise of the ADC will be very obvious."

ECE,3dor95,QuarkyIndividual,5,Sat Jul 18 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Here is my summary:  Positive sequence current is balanced. Negative sequence current is unbalanced. Zero sequence current is ground current.  All faults have positive sequence current.  Bolted three phase faults (and balanced loads) only have positive sequence current.  All other faults are unbalanced, so they'll have negative sequence currents.  Faults that involve ground will have zero sequence.  Double line to ground and single line to ground have zero sequence. Line to line doesn't.    For weird faults, just ask yourself whether it's balanced, and whether it involves ground.   As far as sources go, a delta source can't provide zero sequence currents (because it's not connected to ground).  Phase shifts through delta-wye transformers are goofy because the negative sequence components will shift in the opposite direction of the positive."
ECE,3dor95,plural_of_nemesis,2,Sat Jul 18 04:02:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. In terms of 'intuitiveness', understanding the basic information the causes each component should be sufficient.    Positive = system in balanced steady-state Negative = system imbalance/voltage current deviation between phases Zero = Ground issues/faults.   I've always associated negative sequence as a measure of the imbalance of a system - fault or not. Obviously its more prevalent in faults, but even steady-state operation will have some negative sequence component. Too much of an imbalance is bad for the system as the negative sequence creates a 120 Hz rotating field in synchronous generators that absolutely wrecks them if it gets high enough."
ECE,3dor95,who_dat_who_der,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"To add to your post. It might help to visualize zero sequences as three vectors moving in the same direction on a 3 phase line.  So for a Y device, if it has a ground, then the current of all phases will exit through ground via kirchhoff current law ( Ygnd_i = A_i + B_i + C_i ). A Y device without ground, or a Delta connected device, will not be able to fulfill this kirchoff requirement (Thus is represented in zero seq as an open circuit).  Which is why when drawing zero seq, you need to assess if the transformer is ground connected, and if so which side."

I'm not exactly sure how to translate intuition, but these might help:   http://www.gedigitalenergy.com/smartgrid/Dec07/7-symmetrical.pdf http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-061-introduction-to-electric-power-systems-spring-2011/readings/MIT6_061S11_ch4.pdf https://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=100686   I guess one way to think of it is to pretend you're rotating above a merry go round. If you rotate the same direction as the merry-go-round, it's relatively easy to pull the merry-go-round one way or the other. If you're rotating opposite directions, it's kinda painful.  Other than that, there's some fundamental concepts in linear algebra / discrete spatial Fourier series that apply here, not only to a 3-phase system but to an N-phase system, where you can perform a change of basis from per-phase voltages or currents into various complex harmonics. (zero-sequence = the DC component, other sequences correspond to the complex harmonics... a 5-phase system has two positive and two negative sequences, one at the fundamental spatial frequency P0,P1,P2,P3,P4 and one at the 2nd spatial harmonic P0,P2,P4,P1,P3)"

When an unbalance occurs this doesn't work anymore. The most common situation when one wants to study an unbalance is when short circuits happen but it is also important when studying low voltage distribution and loads are spread unevenly between phases. When solving an unbalanced problem, writing the equations in a-b-c is tedious and not very intuitive. Instead, many decades ago Fortescue proposed a mathematical transformation that enables working with a different set of variables which make it easier to understand what's going on. Positive, negative and zero rather than a-b-c. It is just a linear transformation but if you use it the new variables come in handy because of a pile of reasons already mentioned by othe people in the comments here."

Everything from building and support staff, all the way up to principal engineers and fellows who decide what the architectures will be and what the device physics say can be made, to people who run the companies.  Okay, but really, let's assume you're an ECE, with a BS or MS. Your most likely jobs will be:  On the silicon side:   High-volume manufacturing team; basically getting products out the door - they work, but you do fine-tuning, work on quick but efficient tests, collect statistics, figure out just what is needed to be tested, report data back to design teams Post-silicon debug: similar to HVM, except you work on slightly less completed products, run much longer and bigger tests, and find design errors galore, and often workarounds (""how do we get linux to boot, at the right frequencies, given this errata, but no chance to spin a new revision"") Pre-silicon debug, often combined with above: you get models, build models, and run tests on models; if things go well, you figure out all the tests before the silicon arrives, run it very quickly on silicon, and get the product out the door; you find design issues that can be fixed, and workarounds before silicon arrives Validation / verification: basically supersets of the above, and also include a bunch of other work Emulation: you work with debug teams to build and emulate designs, often for debug and performance analysis Simulation: see above for emulation, but much slower, and in software rather than hardware All of these jobs I just listed tend to require a lot of programming Okay, then there's implementation: basically, you get a design, make it happen; physical implementation, layout, dealing with analog stuff, etc etc etc There's design: you get an architecture, you make a design that conforms to it Architecture: decide what the thing will look like Also related to architecture: things like the actual physical IO A lot of teams work on a certain IP block, so you might have a USB team whose only job is to provide USB blocks; everything above basically on a relatively small team Integration, people who figure out how to move the blocks together and all that   Packaging:   Packaging: connecting the silicon's IO to a package IO, making the package capable of lasting for years or even decades with hugely and quickly varying temperature changes This is hugely important, it's not just putting a piece of silicon in a piece of metal with some caps Also, these days, putting multiple parts on package, interposers, stacking, and so on   Systems side:   Someone actually has to build the systems surrounding the chip... Reference designs: similar to what a customer will want, often customers get full schematics and layout to copy directly and modify if they wish; this might be board-level (chip plus peripherals) or system level (think an entire rack of servers; this is how our parts talk to each other, ram, storage, networking of all sorts, going through all manner of different and complex systems) Internal reference designs: see above, but different in key ways (might use better power supplies to remove variability, might stuff boards full of every peripheral possible, etc) Internal development platforms: see above... might be super barebones to just test a chip, might be very similar to a shipped product but massively expanded with thousands of test points for debug, whatever   Things you might be designing:   Cores, or specific parts of cores (execution pipelines, scatter/gather stuff, decoders, ooo engines, GPU pipelines, whatever) Caches IO / analog blocks of a million different kinds, used for peripherals Intra-processor communication devices (buses, etc) Signal processor blocks (for images, video, audio, etc) Home agents, memory controllers, all manner of complex and very important blocks   The list stretches nearly to infinity.  The types of chips you might be working on:   Small micros, like 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit micros used in embedded worlds, usually running in the 50MHz or less range Bigger micros, like 32-bit ARM/MIPS/etc designs running at 50, 100, 150 Mhz, maybe more Application processors, 32-bit or 64-bit ARM/MIPS/x86/etc designs running in the multi-hundred-MHz or GHz range ""Big"" chips: chips intended for stuff like phones, tablets, laptops (see above for application processors), but even bigger stuff for laptops, desktops, servers, etc FPGAs, big and small, with or without tons of different IP blocks including even big cores CPLDs, small FPGAs Specific kinds of peripherals: ROM chips, IO expanders, muxes, god, there are a million of these little devices All manner of sensor chips All manner of power control chips... regulators, converters, battery chargers, power management of all sorts Flash memory of all sorts, for cards and solid-state hard drives ASICs that are controllers for specific devices (like a controller for a certain family of flash memory) Networking-specific stuff that also tends to be expensive and very purpose-specific Peripherals supporting common big chips - for example, you might be working on a southbridge/northbridge/PCH for a laptop/desktop/server chip, or a coprocessor for a phone/tablet chip All manner of wireless stuff - baseband processors, wifi/bluetooth/2.4ghz chips, and so on and so on   God, there are a ton of things you can do in semi."

I am not sure exactly how but from what i read it seems like you are just stepping on a parallel plate capacitor and measuring the change in the capacitance to determine the amount of pressure.   It doesn't detect pressure, it detects the change in the electrical field, caused by the high water content the human body, which distorts the electric field of the capacitor. It would be basically the same as turning your floor into a massive capacitive touchscreen, like an ipad has.   Advantages, it wouldn't detect anything like furniture on the floor and it might be possible to embed the sensor several cm below the surface, under tiles, carpet or wood, experimentation would be needed.  The downside is that it might interact badly with shoes, with the worse case being platform shoes with the foot far above the surface. Once again, experimentation would be needed, but you can tune the sensitivity of such sensors to an extent.  As far as building such a sensor goes, you need a two metal plates with an insulating layer between them and a way of measuring the capacitance. Tinfoil and paper would probably work as plates and insulators, but in highschool we built one using two metal baking trays and wooden spacers to create an air gap. It could detect a human hand about 20cm above.   You would lay a grid of capacitors on the floor (or under it), with the size of the capacitors determining the resolution of your sensor, with say 10x10cm capacitors you should be able to detect individual feet and with larger 30x30cm capacitors you should still be able to pick out individual people. The larger capacitors will give you greater range, which will help with issues like thick floors or shoes."

One size fits all is never actually that. There might be 1% of applications that are not covered and that 1% may be what your company utilizes almost 100% of the time.  Wildlife protection is a passive device so failures may go unnoticed until something catastrophically fails or faults.  I would say if a manufacturer offers the wildlife protection option for their switch gear or transformers then get that option since it was made for that application.  My company uses wildlife fences around outdoor switchgear and I would think any size fits all in that application is fine since it's not being installed directly on a transformer or something that can fault.

Streaming OFDM (digital TV for example) probably has to use pilot tones. These are just carriers scattered through the signal which can be used for tuning and carrier synchronization.

ECE,3dfkg7,psycoee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:46 2015 UTC,A preamble is pretty simple.  You just agree that each frame starts with a particular symbol or sequence of symbols and then adjust your receiver phase until you start seeing those symbols.
ECE,3dfkg7,psycoee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:35 2015 UTC,But how many times a second does this have to be done? Surely multi-path and movement/orientation will throw the 'calibration' out of lock and what happens if this occurs too frequently?
ECE,3dfkg7,freyyr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:34:23 2015 UTC,"It happens at the beginning of every frame, so thousands of times per second.  Since it only needs to be valid for the duration of the frame, movement isn't a huge issue if the frame duration is limited to something reasonable.  If something does happen, you lose that frame, but wireless protocols are never 100% reliable on the physical layer.  Obviously, in an actual implementation, this can get pretty complex.  For example, the 802.11ac (Wifi) frame format is getting to be horrendously complicated, because there are literally thousands of possible transmission formats and configurations.  The training fields are for everything, including acquiring the framing, dealing with the channel, and training MIMO receivers.  http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/wireless/wi-fi/ieee-802-11ac-gigabit.php"
ECE,3dfkg7,rfgrunt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"For preamble, you generally pick a sequence with good autocorrelation properties. The 13-length Barker Code is a common choice.  You usually transmit the preamble using BPSK at the start of each frame (regardless of higher-order scheme used). For a gray-coded QAM constellation, by padding each symbol with one bit of the barker sequence, you end up with BPSK (eg: for 13-barker +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 −1 −1 +1 +1 −1 +1 −1 +1 in a 16-QAM constellation, you'd transmit 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111. Because 0000 and 1111 have the greatest distance, your constellation collapses to two points at the corners of the constellation - ie: BPSK).  On the RX side, you can pick up the sequence using an FIR filter which has taps that are the reverse-ordered barker sequence (ie: a correlation filter). Whenever you detect a spike coming out of the filter above a certain threshold, you've spotted the sequence. The phase of the spike directly corresponds to the phase rotation of the constellation, so just rotate by that amount, and you've got phase recovery.  Another nifty thing: you can also use the preamble for efficient symbol timing recovery. Let's say after your matched filter you have 16 samples per symbol and you want to know which one to take for maximum SNR. You could do something like early/late gate recovery, but that inevitably has some implementation loss and requires a lock time. Instead, what you do is split the signal into 16 independent paths and downsample each path with a different sampling offset, so that each output samples a different point in the symbol.  You then pass each output through the aforementioned FIR correlation filter to pick up the barker code. You compare the outputs and look for the detection spike. If you delay the output signals properly, you'll get the spikes to line up in time. The magnitude of the largest spike tells you the sample index in the symbol period you want to sample the symbol for optimum signal to noise ratio.  Hope this helps!"

ECE,3dfkg7,p_j_w,2,Thu Jul 16 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Are you asking how to receive an IQ signal? Do you have raw, untracked IQ symbols and you need to turn them into bits? This would require making a Phase Lock Loop (such as the Costas Loop mentioned in /u/kingofthejaffacakes's link).  Or do you need to be sure that your symbol decisions are correct, and resolve any phase ambiguity (ie. your QPSK signal isn't actually rotated 90, 180 or 270 degrees)? Resolving phase ambiguity requires data-aiding (the general term for preambles and such). How frequently you need to send a preamble depends on your acceptable error rate, how good your symbol tracking is (the loop bandwidth of your phase lock loop), and how bad your signal is (SNR, phase offsets your loop can't track, etc).  If you don't having a changing phase offset, you can apply a constant phase shift to a QPSK signal, for example, until the corrected input IQ symbols look like your expected QPSK constellation. Your problem then is phase ambiguity; whether your signal is truly aligned or if its still 90, 180, or 270 degrees off, and the only way to fix that is with data aiding. Does that answer your question?"
ECE,3dfkg7,tonyarkles,6,Thu Jul 16 06:59:14 2015 UTC,"It is my understanding that by multiplying by either a sine or cosine function and integrating.

ECE,3dfkg7,fuzzyPuppy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Well, that's sorta true :P But not what I'm asking. When you receive a quadrature signal, it will have some time delay when after it has been transmitted. Unless this time delay is exactly a multiple of one period, there will be a phase shift equal to w*delta-t where delta-t is the time delay. This phase shift literally corresponds to a counter-clockwise phase shift in a constellation. My question is how they correct for this shift without knowing anything about the transmitted data. And like I said, with BPSK, it's a little straightworward since the Q channel is essentially 0 so all you have to do is rotate the constellation till your Q vector is completely 0. with any of the other complicated modulation schemes it's not so trivial."

You need to define abcd parameters at output variables from S parm results, and then calcule Z0=sqrt(B/C). The result is Z0 over frequency, with Re and Im parts (Im part usually very small). There must be a function in hfss to convert S to Abcd parameters. In Ads its stoabcd. Or you can look at S11, and if its well matched."

ECE,3ddijd,thyratron,4,Wed Jul 15 19:49:48 2015 UTC,The black thing. It's a rubber barrier touching two phases. The white thing is just a sticker in the back of the gear.
ECE,3ddijd,Maxsablosky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:31 2015 UTC,A rubber barrier at that level is crazy we would have to have some type of ceramic insulator like honestly what is the rubber gunna do… it's laughable and fucking dangerous.
ECE,3ddijd,Maxsablosky,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"It all really depends on the dielectric strength of the material. Using rubber, glastic, and other like materials at 480v is  usually more than enough to insulate the phases of the gear. Most of the time at 480v, it is not necessary to even have barriers between the phases. The bus bar usually just has to be a certain distance away from the other buses and enclosure of the gear and the air between the phases is enough to provide proper protection from phases to phase or phase to ground faults (excluding contact by any objects). I rarely see ceramic insulators on anything less than 4160v. They are just too expensive and not really necessary. In this case, the piece of rubber fit into a slot on the breaker (zoom in on the bottom of the piece of rubber), it probably was made specifically for this breaker by the manufacture, but wasn't installed correctly and fell over."
ECE,3ddijd,CESmokey,2,Thu Jul 16 10:40:28 2015 UTC,Oh no I agree the air is a fine insulator with enough space but I would love to know what the composition of the rubber insulator was great post!
ECE,3ddijd,Maxsablosky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:36:35 2015 UTC,'Rubber' is pretty standard.
ECE,3ddijd,CESmokey,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:17:38 2015 UTC,Rubber is not standard in High Voltage Application due to the propensity for the rubber to crack allowing moisture in overtime. Even if this was a polymer it would be just as cost effective to place porcelain in between. It's just a shit design in my opinion.
ECE,3ddijd,Maxsablosky,2,Wed Jul 22 02:46:36 2015 UTC,480 is not high voltage. And yes the rubbery synthetic insulation is commonplace on stuff into the 30ks(highest I work on). Primarily see it in switchgear around bus joints and the like. Usually instead of a hundred wraps of tape.
ECE,3ddijd,ultrapampers,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:51:10 2015 UTC,Agreed with the 480's but I'm to used to ridiculous over engineering. I work from 10.5Kv to 500Kv on alot of the switch gear in the high voltage you just can't afford to use rubber I thought this was a high voltage discussion my bad!

ECE,3dbzvd,CylonGlitch,5,Wed Jul 15 23:15:10 2015 UTC,Depends on what you mean by by hardware. FPGA... sure. Analog... you're gonna have a bad time. It's easier to go from hardware to software vs vice versa. To quote the Bob Widlar the analog wizard... any idiot can count from 0 to 1. FE will only help you if you have an interest in power utilities.
ECE,3dbzvd,incognito1600,2,Wed Jul 15 03:58:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the PE being only utilities related. While power companies require an PE, other fields will look at PEs highly because its quite an accomplishment. There are multiple EE subsets of the PE including computer engineering, electronics, power, and control systems.   Other fields that ultized a PE stamp can be industrial control systems or HVAC engineers that help design buildings, power is just one field that uses a PE license for legal reasons.  I've interviewed at many jobs and everyone has said great things of getting your PE and how it will more open doors later in life."
ECE,3dbzvd,Bananas_n_Pajamas,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:43 2015 UTC,It's a double edged sword really. You get the stamp... but you also then carry the sole liability. Those guys that are using the PE are typically building the system and process versus designing the actual equipment.
ECE,3dbzvd,incognito1600,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"Very true about liability. For those that will never stamp anything it's a great license to have and does nothing but increase your value as an employee. For those that use it regularly, you welcome legal backlash if aren't a very good engineer but you usually have a group when working on projects so the likelihood of stamping a project that is going to fail is small, but still the liability hangs over you. I can see the hesitation but in my opinion the reward definitely out-weighs the risk."
ECE,3dbzvd,Bananas_n_Pajamas,3,Wed Jul 15 22:04:27 2015 UTC,And here I am trying to do the exact opposite.
ECE,3dbzvd,cyrusm,3,Wed Jul 15 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"Basically to be a Hardware guy, employers are going to want to know your hardware considerations when designing, testing, implementation, etc.  Chances are there will be a limitation on code space and memory.  Also how can one use hardware to their advantage to either reduce costs of or simplify firmware implementations.    Basically in your position I would start off by buying a microcontroller development kit and start trying to communicate to it from a computer or another micro via serial (UART, SPI, I2C).   Once the establishing the basis of common serial communication, move to RF.  Maybe create a data logging project off of some sensor input from the micro.  Eventually I would then take the same projects and then see how you can break the hardware apart into simpler circuits.  For instance, one may only need an 8 bit micro to communicate sensing data to another micro which then sends the data to an SD card."
ECE,3dbzvd,wheresbicki,3,Wed Jul 15 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"Having been a programmer in my early years and getting my BSEE later, I can tell you that both fields are very deep rabbit holes.

You'll become a good programmer, but you'll forget what you learned at school and not learn the million-and-one things you find out in industry as an EE.  Your only hope is to follow the advice of everyone here that says you need to do hardware development at night. Actually designing and building hardware is the only way you will stay an EE.

ECE,3dbzvd,jubjub7,2,Thu Jul 16 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"Mainly, far fewer job opportunities, both in terms of numbers and locations. They aren't getting paid as much as software engineers and have a very limited opportunity for advancement at the company or an upward move at another company because of this. There is a lot of talk of outsourcing to China and India, more so than in software.  Many of the things in your edit also ring true and are great reasons. Cranky greybeards, YES. The youngest person on my team (apart from me, obviously) is just turning 40. Zero women. Not good for the social aspect. Also, it results in everyone using antiquated technologies and tools. Forget what you learn in school, that stuff is 20 years ahead of what these guys are using. ""Python"" was a mystical word to these men. They work with FPGAs so shitty toolchains with shitty non-intuitive UI is prevalent (looking at you Xilinx).

ECE,3dceaa,throw8675away309,5,Wed Jul 15 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"That's a big motor.  There are different ways to do this and it also depends on what type of speed control you require: do you want to control the speed youself by turning a potentiometer or do you need precise speed control through a computer or something?  If manual control is fine for you, you could use old school solutions: the speed of a DC motor with constant excitation (magnets) is approximately proportional to the voltage applied to its armature winding. A variable autotransformer followed by a diode rectifier would allow you to tune the voltage you apply to the motor and control its speed this way. The problem of this setup is that current (and torque) can get very high if the motor is blocked somehow. A circuit breaker between the variac and the diode rectifier could be used to prevent an overcurrent. Alternatively, a rheostat in series with the motor would allow fine-tuning the torque.  If you don't know what you are doing you'd better buy some commercial solution. Unfortunately, these motors are not that common any more but there should be old equipment in Ebay that will do the trick. Search for ""DC motor rheostat"" or ""DC motor speed"". Good luck!"
ECE,3dceaa,minipimmer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:11:11 2015 UTC,thank you very much! I appreciate the advice! Why aren't they as common anymore?
ECE,3dceaa,minipimmer,2,Fri Jul 17 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"DC motors used to be popular for medium power applications requiring speed control because with a simple rheostat you could control their speed. The only problem with them is that they require maintenance as their brushes die and they may collect dust and crap that needs to be cleaned. Squirrel cage induction motors (the most common AC type) are cheaper and require less care. Once GTOs and IGBTs became available, power electronic converters to drive these motors became very attractive and little by little replaced DC motors. More recently, the squirrel cage induction motors are being replaced by permanent magnet synchronous motors, which can be more compact and have higher efficiency."
ECE,3dceaa,AmpEater,3,Sat Jul 18 17:37:04 2015 UTC,You want a variac. It's a transformer that adjusts the output voltage from 0 -to- line (some can boost too). You'll run that into a rectifier to get DC out.  Cheap and easy.
ECE,3dceaa,ttustudent,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:23 2015 UTC,Could you include more details about the motor? What is it's current rating? Are you just trying to run in one direction or do you need some kind of control like an H-Bridge?
ECE,3dceaa,jeffbell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I'm only hoping to run it in one direction, however I'd really like to be able to control the speed of it.

ECE,3d9zrl,turdBouillon,3,Tue Jul 14 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Craiglist might have some but I'd search Indeed.com, simplyhired.com, linkedin.com, etc.   Don't be afraid to apply. Most jobs will ask for a 2-year technical degree, but just highlight the fact you work with electronics and have been tinkering with computers all your life. Most employers, depending on the job, will look past inexperience if you truly seem eager and passionate about the field.   Polish up that resume so it now emphasizes your proficiency in certain software or electronics (Office, Adobe, Windows, Mac-OSX, Linux) as well as your electronics background (name brand equipment like fender or gibson). You can make a tiny experience look great on a resume if you know how to do it right.  Another thought: Air National Guard Reserves or similar military branch you can easily find a position as a electronics technician and they will pay for school later in life"

ECE,3d9zrl,Bananas_n_Pajamas,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hardware engineer, but...   I am a liberal arts drop-out who bounces around the top Silicon Valley companies as a software/infrastructure engineer. These are my thoughts...    Doing one-off hardware projects is a great hobby and I love it myself but I don't know of a good way to monetize that and I don't want to wake up one day tied to a mental assembly line doing repetitive work. I do know that my salary as a software guy buys me a lot of hobby gear.    If you are geographically near a tech-hub (San Francisco, LA, Seattle, NY, Austin, Houston, SLC, Raleigh...) and are interested in software it is relatively easy to get contract work with just a good CV and a link to your work on github. I have no degree or accreditation and have never even taken a CS course but my (publicly available) work speaks for itself and after about two years of contract work (with a few prestigious names in there - in a crunch even Google hires warm bodies...) I no longer seek work, they call me.    My advice, if you're interested in working in tech but don't want to commit to going back to school or risk getting stuck in a hardware niche is to install Linux on something and start fishing for neat projects on github. Learn a few languages and build neat projects. Publicly. Blog about what you're doing, contribute back to a project like Debian by adopting a piece of software you care about and talk about that. Just get out there and leave a trail of projects (hardware and software) that you can point potential employers to. I've managed to get a lot of attention for myself from employers by showcasing hardware projects that I've done with no bearing whatsoever on the job they're hiring for. Building guitar pedals for shits&giggles in your free time makes you very attractive to employers looking for smart, self motivated candidates. I'd give you an interview.    Perhaps you really do want to study hardware, it is really fun, but there's definitely a lower entry bar in software and dat $$$ buys a lot of hardware for weekend projects...  $.02"

[i know that sounds crazy.]  after years of futzing around with software, i just feel a passion for hardware that i never got from software. i know it's way easier to make money in like, app development or whatever, but i guess in a lot of ways it's not really about the money to me.

I had a focus in power engineering and I tried for months to get internships and full-time positions but I never got one. I somehow kept getting PLC/SCADA offers and now my current job has turned into PCB design.

I know this only counts as anecdotal experience but I can tell you that my fathers company (of about 35) is more than willing to hire someone without a degree if they can demonstrate good problem solving ability and passion for what they do. They have hired someone without a college degree, someone with an associates in EET, and people with bachelors in biology and physics. I know the bio and physics degrees are more STEM-y than yours but in relation to the work they actually do, their degree didn't prepare them any better than yours.  So I guess thats my advice, research small businesses in your area and see if they have reqs out. Contact them by email or drop off a resume in person highlighting all of the project experience you have and write a cover letter why you think you're a good fit for the position. Big businesses are just too bureaucratic to take a chance on someone without a relevant degree.   Good luck."

It'll cause uneven electrode degradation.   Probably active PFC to generate a HVDC bus, then a full bridge. Quasi-resonant is also not unheard of (Like a half bridge into a resonant tank), but I doubt it for a 1kW ballast."
ECE,3d7cib,Irrumatus,4,Tue Jul 14 10:40:34 2015 UTC,"If it has that wide of an input voltage range, it's almost certainly electronic and has a feedback loop that regulates the lamp current by varying the conversion ratio.  In general, gas discharge lamps have a negative resistance coefficient, which is the opposite of an incandescent.  That's why they require ballasts -- without one, the lamp would rapidly self-destruct.  In fact, I really doubt the lamp requires more than line voltage once it starts -- once the gas ionizes, the lamp usually presents a fairly low impedance.  Also, a variable transformer is called a variac.  A varistor is a nonlinear element used for surge protection."
ECE,3d7cib,psycoee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"Whenever I saw ""varistor"" I knew it didn't seem right but I couldn't put my finger on why. This is why, thanks."

That was for a step down though. You can regulate through opto couplers with shunt regulators, back emf on sensing coils, etc. Depends on what kind of isolation you want and what kind of tolerance you can have in the feedback loop."
ECE,3d7cib,incognito1600,2,Tue Jul 14 04:41:17 2015 UTC,"At 1kW, this thing is probably active PFC, generating a ~400VDC bus regardless of input, then the output section is regulating current and could care less about what the input is, because it's just being fed that constantish HVDC bus. It's not likely that 480VAC input is actually supported (OP said he wasn't sure). That seems very high and expensive to do for 1kW. 264VAC is a typically spec'd max input voltage.

Newer ballast can take a continuous range of inputs and have additional control circuitry to regulate the output voltage. This usually involves an IC, feedback loop, and a flyback transformer."

ECE,3d1uzu,Pele2048,11,Mon Jul 13 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure if there was a catastrophic failure OSHA would have been involved and there would have been large fines given that the customer knew the transformer was failing over the course of a few years and didn't act to correct the problem.  I am not certain if they are obligated by OSHA or the NEC to take it out of service.  My company and I were against putting the transformer back in service.  We did not want to take the risk of livening the transformer as we thought there was a high probability the transformer would fault/fail upon livening.  We thought it was too unsafe to do so, and we told the customer that.  The thing with electrical components/equipment is that there no sure way to predict when something is going to fail.  It could have lasted 2 more days, 2 more months or another 2 years, it's really impossible to tell.  Given our knowledge and experience with situations like this, we knew that the risk was high and that the transformer was going to fail sooner rather than later.  The customer is a large manufacturing facility.  The two transformers feeding that part of the plant were heavily loaded, they had no other power source as they couldn't run all the loads on one of the two transformers.  Luckily this was a planned shutdown over the 4th of July weekend so the plant was down until  Monday and they were able to schedule the replacement on that Saturday.  I don't know about exact or final costs, but I believe that the replacement transformer was around $40,000 and the install another $10,000. The cost of a catastrophic failure would have been a lot more.  The transformer would have taken out two other transformers, three high voltage switches, some of the walls of the facility, the overhead poles, and possibly a few lives. If no one got injured or killed, the company would still have been down 3-6 weeks if a failure happened."

Why couldn't you just replace the oil for them when they didn't replace it? It sounds like it could run for a few years at a time before too much hydrogen built up, and that would have been at least a cheap patch. If it was that important, why didn't they have three transformers that all spread out the load and provided single-loss redundancy?  EDIT: What did the fuse disconnect, phase B? Or did it fail to actually sever the connection? And what kind of transformer is this that we can barely make out from pictures?"
ECE,3d1uzu,brubakerp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:05:03 2015 UTC,I'm not an electrician but I worked at a magnet wire company for a few years.  I think the main problem is the corona occurring.  If I remember correctly it indicates that there is (at least) a partial failure of in the insulation surrounding the conductor on the winding.  If this is the case it's only a matter of time before the corona is able to eat away at the insulation of nearby wires and cause a short.
ECE,3d1uzu,Red_Raven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought there already was a short that removed part of the coil, maybe even a few such shorts. I thought the transformer was just so powerful it just carried on running at lower effectiveness."
ECE,3d1uzu,PermanantFive,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"The hydrogen is caused by the breakdown of the oil.  You couldn't just replace the oil, as the source of the corona would still be there.  /u/brubakerp is correct in saying that the corona is the issue, and that it would eventually break down the insulation and possibly cause a short somewhere inside the transformer.  With a short you have the possibility of arcing, and that could definitely ignite the hydrogen and any other flammable gases that have built up inside the transformer.  There are three fuses inside the transformer on the high side.  Four years ago, the B phase fuse blew, but not before the damage to the winding already occurred.  This is a 2000 KVA oil filled padmount transformer  12,470Y/7200 x 4160Y/2400."
ECE,3d1uzu,Red_Raven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:51:27 2015 UTC,"This is some very interesting stuff. The damage to the B coil is fascinating, it kinda looks like the inter-layer insulation has moved slightly, or is starting to fall apart. At first I was amazed at how much damage the corona discharge caused, especially operating at only 12kV under oil, until I saw that the fault was 4 years old.  I'm gonna have to do a lot of the same tests for a transformer I'm currently working on (turns ratio, DC resistance and low-voltage operation has been done, insulation leakage is next). Its a little 15kVA 4.16kV single phase dry-type distribution transformer from GE (LV coils are open, the HV coils are epoxy-potted) which is slowly getting built into a cabinet with a 75A variac and some current-limiting chokes. Hopefully I won't encounter any insulation woes, if the epoxy potting fails the entire transformer will need replacing :("
ECE,3d1uzu,Red_Raven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"How did it continue on with a missing phase? I thought three phase equipment kind of.... needed that phase. And I thought replacing the oil would give it a few more years because it took so long for the levels to get that high to begin with. New oil wouldn't have hydrogen, it would have to build back up. How much hydrogen can even build up in there? I would think a small blow-out cap could prevent a devastating explosion. Hell, install a spark igniter underneath it and fire it once a day. Blow up anything now before it gets too dangerous."
ECE,3d1uzu,Pele2048,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"The transformer was performing fine electrically. The structural integrity and the insulation of the winding are what was in question. You can see from the pictures that the whole winding is shot, supports and insulation are cracked. We were afraid that the inrush from livening the transformer could have caused a fault. Replacing the oil would not help fix the winding and continue operation of the transformer would just lead to more deterioration of the winding supports and insulation. The hydrogen is a secondary problem, the main being the damaged winding."

They can be employed as a useful power supply for spark-gap Tesla coils, Marx generators, voltage multipliers, etc etc. In this video I'm just abusing a pair until near-destruction at about 8 or 9kVA (they were removed from old 800W ovens, nearly a 5x overload for each transformer). Theres a few other videos of high voltage transformers and a couple of cheap'n'dirty Tesla coils on the channel too.  But, yeah, pretty dangerous.

I see a lot of transformers labeled with FR3 fluid.  Dry type transformers are also fine for indoors, cooling fans help a lot in prolonging the life of them.  Routine cleaning and maintenance also help extend the life of the transformers, as many air cooled dry type transformers become filthy from dust and dirt building up inside of them.

ECE,3d1uzu,Muffin_Topper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:58:12 2015 UTC,"Yep... Seen the aftermath of that.  I work in a building that had several banks of switchgear in the penthouse. Each of those switchgear banks had a 13.8kV to 480VAC transformer. The switchgear was installed in the late 1970's and hasn't been maintained since the early 1990's.  One humid summer day, a feeder breaker tripped (Due to the dust buildup and humidity)  Due to the heat (Because the cooling fans had long since stopped; upon transformer disassembly there was a 3 inch thick layer of dust on the blades.) a stripped bolt was being held in the bus bars form the secondary of the transformer to the switchgear. Upon the breaker tripping, the transformer cooled down and allowed the bolt to fall and wedge between an adjacent bus bar.  Some engineer in the office building had the brilliant idea to go up to the penthouse and find the tripped breaker that took down a majority of the building. This blew the back off the transformer.  I wish I woulda gotten pics of the bus bars where the bolt was."

Technology development these days can be complex, teams with cross-functional skill sets are necessary.  But I think I know what you mean... In the engineering team setting you interact deeply with the same people over and over, and you want something where you interact with a large volume of people.  My fiancée is a doctor, so her and I get to see total opposites in our work lives.  Personally, I've made the switch to try to get into a more customer-facing role so I can get that 'volume interaction', and don't be discouraged by being an 'introvert'... lots of people mistake that to mean shyness, but it just really means that in times of crisis you turn inward for energy/renewal.  There are lots of introverts that aren't shy and I consider myself one of them.  I've made the change now to technical marketing, so I get to leverage some of my technical experience.  Its smart that you're deciding early and looking at more than just ""how much am I gonna get paid"" and diving deeply into what truly makes you happy.

ECE,3cxrh9,jwar91,31,Sat Jul 11 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"Silicon wafers are expensive. Silicon, however, is not.  The answer is no, you can't. You can't undoped silicon. Chips are ground thinner than wafers to fit in a package.   You can reprocess wafers for fab process targeting and training - take a fully processed wafer, grind it down, and use it for some purposes, but not for product. And not once a wafer has been diced for packaging."
ECE,3cxrh9,tty2,11,Sat Jul 11 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"Even wafers aren't that expensive.  A blank 12"" Si wafer is under $500 these days.  The purified raw material costs some tiny fraction of that -- growing the crystal, cutting it, grinding and polishing mostly drive the cost.  The un-purified raw material is basically some special kind of sand, and it's not very expensive at all.  I'm fairly sure the copper parts of a chip package is worth far more than the silicon in terms of scrap value.  Not to mention that in terms of purity, you are probably better off recycling beer bottles to make chips -- they are going to require the same amount of effort to purify.  You'd be far better off recovering things like tantalum capacitors, gold, tin, and copper from the PCBs the chip packages are mounted on.  Even that is only profitable when it's done illegally by small children in third-world countries with no pollution controls.  In fact, the cost of the actual processed silicon is often negligible for small or analog chips, or things like MEMS.  Packaging and testing can get very, very expensive.  A wafer in an older technology like 0.35um costs something like $600 in volume, and yields tens of thousands of chips.  The cost of doing packaging and testing is far higher."

There's no single price, and quotes from different companies can easily vary by 25%+ (for very similar processes, obviously prices can vary more for other reasons/process options even within the same node) before negotiating.  $600/wafer (I assume 12""?) for high volumes of basic 130nm CMOS sounds pretty reasonable to me though."
ECE,3cxrh9,Evidence_Of_Absence,12,Sun Jul 12 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"Silicon wafers are expensive not because silicon is expensive--most of the earth's crust is composed of silicon dixode--the difficulty is achieving the purity and uniformity.   As a result, used silicon gets you nothing. It it has been severely polluted with copper and has very non-uniform charge concentration due to high levels of doping all over the place among other problems...   You can make one-off fixes to already fabricated semiconductors using focused ion beams. This, however, does not alter baselayers. You cannot add new functionality. You FIB to short or open adjacent nets. You are stuck with what you have.   In order to have a microprocessor where the silicon can be reconfigured.

I've worked with sub 50 nm features on some projects and I currently work with 100s of um to 1 mm features on another one. They both can use the same starting silicon. People who study quantum effects typically use extremely small features, or thicknesses. People who study micro-machined devices generally make larger features.

You're a freshman in engineering, I'd expect you to have almost no experience, even especially if you came from a magnet school. Everything on your resume is padding. The quadcopter build is neat, but nothing more than a hobby, unless you designed your own control board and/or algorithms. But maybe if the interview goes well, you'll prove useful as a soldering iron jockey for grunt labor.  I'd agree with your folks. Spend the first two semesters getting acquainted with your college. Get to know who your professors will be. If you're interested in research, see if they'll be interested in letting you visit their lab and learn what they're doing. Down the road, that can lead to undergraduate internships and research positions. Think about your career, and where you want to go. Masters now, or masters later?  Secondly, although building and studying quads won't do much for your resume, independent design projects are priceless for your engineering skills.

Uno is kinda heavy. Check ""arduino teensy""  Square alum frame? Sounds heavy. Think lighter struts.  You didn't list battery. I know you know you need that.   Battery+Arduino+motors = melted arduino. You are missing something here I won't give it away since you want to EE. Big hint: atmega328 Max current draw is like 40mA or so. Check motor specs: 40mA will spin a pager motor weight but it ain't gonna defy gravity.   This exact missing piece is actually a ginormous great question to ramp up on early EE stuff: pick a motor you think is around right size, see how much current that motor draws, and figure out if the Arduino can deliver that. How many motors you need? Hmm.... Yes you can still have arduino as controller. But.....   the coding of the flight controller. I would like to try my hand at making some code for this because I know it's my weakest area   Wow ok no shying away from challenging problems!! Ok just gonna ask this once: are you looking at EE focus because you don't like coding too much? Coding a real time flight controller on an arduino will require some fairly heavy lifting, in terms of control theory, attitude/balance computation, real-time or at least constant-time sensor integration, power management and possibly jitter-free motor phase generation... It can definitely be done. I think a from-scratch bare metal arduino software controller is a 1-12 month project depending on skill & scope discipline.   I don't have to do other fancy things like connect an IMU to the arduino   Wait what? You don't? On a quad? You sure about that?   to automate yaw/pitch/roll balancing   Hmm maybe it's easier than I think, but i do believe you will find it tremendously difficult to lift off and fly stable for more than 3 seconds without an on-board IMU. If you plan to ""VFR"" your quad with your eyes and thumbs, the feedback loop latency will make it uncontrollable. I think. I am not a real expert. But friends that have built quads have needed at least accelerometers and gyros.  I agree you don't have to hand roll the RF lots of choices there (& auto pilot for short flights).

Provided you're not working on High voltage (in the kV) you should be good with most oscopes to tie to earth or a known system ground and probe it out. If you're above 120Vac check the max voltage of your tool. Typically a system ground is not far from Earth in potential as there's a bleed off resistor or transient protection to tie it off.

ECE,3ct0pg,finnacamm,5,Fri Jul 10 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"You just want something simple like a light to flash when someone is upstairs?  My first thought is two Arduinos and two nRF24L01+ devices.  Two Arduino Micros (real or clone types):  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AFY2S56  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OK0NFPI  Two RF transmitters:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E594ZX0  You can use this RF24 library to drive the radios: https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24  Then stuff like sensors, wires, LEDs, and resistors.   You'd have a transmitter Arduino with the sensor, and a receiver Arduino that would drive your notification. The TX guy upstairs detects motion from the sensor, then forms a data packet and sends it with the RF24 library. The RX guy next to you receives that packet, then fires off your notification like an LED.  I do a similar setup like above except that I'm using temperature, humidity, and light sensors and then sending that data with the radios I listed.  EDIT: I just reread this and saw the 150' range. I'm not sure if nRF24 devices work that far, so you may have to double-check me on that. My ranges were all within a house, so like 30-50' max.  EDIT 2: Here's some good links I used to learn about the RF24 usage.   This first one is good in that he explains how he's creating his data packets:  http://www.homautomation.org/2014/09/26/internet-of-things-measure-environnement-data-with-arduino-and-push-it-to-the-web-via-raspberry-pi-and-nrf24l01/  And then this one is another example, with some debug tips:  http://www.madebymarket.com/blog/dev/getting-started-with-nrf24L01-and-arduino.html"

ECE,3ct0pg,one-joule,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the range you get with these (or any radio, really) in practice greatly depends on many factors. That 80m is probably measured under absolutely ideal conditions: no noise, near-perfect antennas and antenna positioning, using the lowest data rate and highest transmit power. In most home environments, your real-world range will be much less.  I strongly suggest finding modules which have antenna connectors (I'd link some but I'm on mobile). You'll need to have good length antennas and perhaps do some experimenting with antenna orientation. You might even consider setting up a relay unit in between, though the coding for that would be..interesting."
ECE,3ct0pg,bluecav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"One other question: Would this arduino be able to run without being plugged into a computer? Could I download my code to the flash and have it plugged into the wall for a power supply? The reason being is that there will be no computer upstairs, so it has to run standalone."
ECE,3ct0pg,bluecav,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They power from micro USB jacks. So to program it, you just plug in a USB cable from a PC and hook up the Arduino. After it's programmed though, all it needs is power from that socket. So you can use a wall plug with a micro usb on the end, like you have for cell phones and stuff.  Some of the clones Arduinos use different USB female plugs. The worst that means though is you might need to buy the right USB cable for it, and just get a wall charger with a normal USB socket. I had to do that when I bought the clone Arduino Micro I listed. It was annoying, but by no means a barrier to using it.  For me, I use the chargers I had for my Raspberry Pi units: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NL7WK2U  If you get a larger Arduino, like the full sized Uno, then you'd just use a different wall adapter. The Arduino Uno for example can be powered from an adapter like this to be standalone: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CP1QLSC  You can also power the Arduino off of batteries directly with the Vin and GND pins. If you do that, you could probably even add the power voltage to the data you send over the radio. Here's some info on how someone suggested reading the power supply voltage with an analog input: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=13912.0  Here's the link to the Arduino Micro specs, which has a power section: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMicro"

Someone with your kind of experience could fetch well over $120k in California -- but then you'd be paying anywhere from 2000-3000 monthly to live, just in rent.  You have to factor that fact into your overall compensation.  I'm not saying that better engineers don't move up and don't get paid more, but the overall salary level is set more by the market than by anything else.  If you want to move up in pay, you're going to have to stick your neck out a little bit and move to an area where there's a more competitive market.  When companies have to fight for the right talent, that's when they start handing out things like the big bonuses, stock, bigger 401(k) match, etc.  Somehow I don't think that where you are in the SE US is going to breed that kind of a market.  One thing I will say is that your vacation is way above average.

ECE,3coucd,FakeEEQ,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"IBM is just trying to stay relevant after they sold their fabs.  There are plenty of working 10nm and 7nm tests, they just tend to be secret until they're actually ready.  Here's some more bullshit:   Somewhat extraordinarily, due to incredibly tight stacking (30nm transistor pitch), IBM claims a surface area reduction of ""close to 50 percent"" over today's 10nm processes.   This is not extraordinary, this is usual. Read the original speech and article by Moore from 1965 and 1975. 7nm is 70% of 10nm, and 70% squared is 49% - there you go, 50% reduction in area. This happens on pretty much every single node shrink: 32 from 45, 22 from 32, 14 from 22, 10 from 14... you get the point.  Moore's Law is not about performance, it is about being able to double the transistors in the same area for around the same cost, roughly every two years (originally one year, and has been revised to between 18 and 24 months, and may need to be revised a bit upwards soon depending on what happens around the 10nm and 7nm nodes.)  I mean, it's extraordinary that Moore's Law has lasted as long as it has, but we all know that geometric progression doesn't go on forever in real life; there are always limits. So the fact that 7nm exists is extraordinary in that respect, but ordinary in being predicted.   EUV lithography is an more interesting innovation   EUV is awesome, and EUV has been promised to be awesome next year for probably ten years now. I've had these discussions in 2011 with the same result. EUV was even renamed due to being so incredibly late; EUV is more X-ray than ultraviolet.  There's nothing wrong with EUV except that it's just really hard to do, and therefore took way more R&D than people originally expected. I'm not shitting on EUV, just on promises of EUV being around the corner.  The article references that, but having the wrinkles ironed out in two or three years... well, color me unsurprised if it doesn't come to pass.  Overall this is a fluff piece. IBM's accomplishments are real, but their accomplishment is that they have test structures on silicon, which is a hell of a lot easier (and comes several years before) an  actual commercial process.  I think we've been able to actually have single-atom or single-molecule transistors, by the way; similarly, it's a really awesome proof of concept but until it's commercialized it's not much more than a cool experiment."

ECE,3cnh2d,suren130,3,Thu Jul 9 07:20:10 2015 UTC,"Propagation of radio signals changes radically with frequency.  Basically very different modes of propagation arise vs. frequency so the ""distance"" (on earth) changes in paradoxical ways.  The article logic is strained and a bit wrong in practice because it ignores this.  For low frequencies, propagation is heavily dependent on the ionosphere so you get reflection of it that create waveguide propagation around the entire planet.  This is shortwave (3-30 MHz) can propagate to the other side of the world with µW of power.  Higher frequencies ""do not see"" the ionosphere except as a minor attenuation so no reflection occurs.  Propagation at 2.4 GHz is exclusively line-of-sight with occasional refraction past large objects (buildings, mountains, etc.).    This is why 2.4 GHz is used for WiFi, etc.: it's precisely the lack of propagation distance except line-of-sight, the beginning of severe atmospheric attenuation and the difficulty of creating very large power levels (requires vacuum tubes) that makes it ideal for cellular communication models which explicitly require poor long distance propagation to work properly.  A 100m antenna will detect 2.4GHz but it will have modal power distribution like a waveguide operating above its fundamental mode so phasing can be problematic.    So a 1/2 or 1/4 wave antenna cut to 2.4 GHz would be better but if you need large received power you would use an array of many 1/2 wave antenna which are connected with proper phase delays.  A variant of this is what a phased-array antenna is about (used in radar)."

Look at how dipoles and monopoles generally use wavelengths as design, and matching.   It's not about length technically, really it is about aperture size. Kinda like the size of a sail boat, a larger one will catch more wind. To design an antenna, you generally will have parameters related to wavelength.

Such space is lossless as there is nothing in it for the signal to interact with. There is nothing in there about loss caused by the atmosphere. Such an equation would be quite complicated with various windows and notches caused by the various gasses.   So, what about that ""20Log10(Frequency)"" term...  A theoretically perfect antenna will emit all the power that it is given. That same antenna when used for reception will receive a signal in proportion to the size of the antenna. A larger antenna will collect more signal. So a high frequency system scaled up to work as a low frequency system will result in more received signal. The ""20Log10(Frequency)"" term takes this effect into account.  Here is what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss#Frequency_dependency"

ECE,3cnh2d,fkeeal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"There's a couple things going on when you talk about antenna propagation loss, you have to consider both the free space path loss (energy spreading) as well as the antenna gain (how much energy is captured by the antenna)  In one very real sense, the article is correct. All EM fields will spread out spherically and experience an inverse squared loss, regardless of frequency. But this is with respect to the physical power density of the wave (W/m2), which is not usually how we think about path loss and link budgets.  Rather, we use the idea of path loss normalized to an ideal isotropic antenna (equal antenna gain in all directions). And the effective capture area (called effective aperture size) of an isotropic antenna is bigger at lower frequencies. So a low frequency isotropic antenna will be able to capture more of the propagating wave than a higher freq isotropic antenna.  So when we talk about path loss, we typically are including this effect, which is why path loss increases with frequency.  Larger antennas can be used to capture more of the wave of course. This corresponds to a directional antenna, which more gain in some direction and less in others. There is a direct relationship between antenna gain, antenna directivity, and effective aperture area. This means that it is impossible to increase the effective aperture area and gain of a passive antenna without making it directional  Note that you can't just make the antenna physically bigger (ie your 100' dipole example), because antennas are resonant and their physical size is generally related to their resonant frequency.  But you can make a big antenna by combining a bunch of smaller antennas (called an antenna array) or by reflecting energy from a large area onto a small antenna (reflector dish)"

ECE,3ck00l,ADDandy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"Is that what you'd be doing?   No, it's verification, specifically writing test benches to test verilog blocks.

ECE,3ck00l,ADDandy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"Ok ok, yeah i do verification and SW/FW at my company.  Do you have any specific questions?  If you have SW knowledge it will help, because most testbbenches are designed using OO or AO methodology. Complex coding will help design complex testbenches. But other than that verification is more test engineering the SW test.   The big thing is recognizing what has to be tested, Figuring out HOW to test it, and making sure you go about everything in an efficient way. Duplication of effort is a huge problem in verification because you almost never have enough time to test the whole chip. So you need to plan out what has to be tested, then figuring out what can be tested at the same time as other things to reduce your test set down to as few tests as possible."

I work for a very large company with hundreds of engineers working in both software and hardware and there aren't really many that can do both (I've only met one who does primarily HW, but did a stint in SW).

Knowing the hardware on an very low level allows me to help out other engineers in SW without the need to pull a HW engineer away for meetings etc.   Going back to verification, i have noticed that my code is way cleaner, and are probably higher quality. Also knowing how SW and by extension the customer will use the chip, i have some extra insight into what corner cases we should cover or getting the designer to change things to make SW's life easier.  Im not sure the exact value of being exposed to both, but i think the difference between a good engineer and a great engineer is being able to apply previous experience to solve tough problems.

Also if you want your cable to last 10+ years dont cheap out... labor to replace a failed cable is going to cost way more then one that lasts.

ECE,3club7,elephant7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:54:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input and I may go with that cable after all.  I was looking at connectors because I expect the sensor could fail prior to the cable doing so and figured that would be an easy swap.  I'm now considering just potting the cable and sensor assembly in a few layers of high quality epoxy and then placing it in a very simple enclosure that allows water to enter.
ECE,3club7,elephant7,3,Thu Jul 9 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"I would still recommend calling/emailing them and asking about it. Seems like you're on a fairly tight budget and you want to make sure you get exactly what you need.  Potting it could work pretty well. You could add some extra cable to each sensor and when one fails just pull it back up, cut the old sensor off, and re-trim/epoxy in the field..."
ECE,3ciaip,mericaa,3,Wed Jul 8 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"One issue (I think): you're using an N-MOSFET as a high-side switch, which means it requires a voltage higher than the drain voltage (which is the level of the source during conduction) to operate."
ECE,3ciaip,0x3432,2,Wed Jul 8 04:09:10 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track. For an N-channel FET, the biasing voltage, Vgs, is the voltage between the gate and the source of the transistor. The higher the voltage differential, the more the transistor ""turns on"". The issue the OP will have here is that his load creates a voltage difference between the negative battery terminal and the source pin of the FET, so the source will never be at 0v. Even though he's got 11.1v on the drain, and he's putting approximately 11.1v on the gate, the voltage difference between the gate and the source, Vgs, will be small as a result of the feedback loop created by the transistor passing current and creating a voltage difference across the applied load, which fights to turn off the transistor.  OP, you need to put the load on the drain-side of your FET and connect the source directly to common. You want to be ""switching ground"" to your load, not ""switching voltage"". Your design won't work (or if it somehow does work, it won't work very well at all) as you have it configured here. I suspect the reason you're not seeing any results is because you don't have a load connected, so your source pin is essentially floating."
ECE,3ciaip,24nm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you so much. Back to the drawing board. Makes perfect sense. I found this article which is pretty good at explaining high side/low side switches after I saw 0x3432's comment. http://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/98.php  Edit: wait a minute, so can I fix my problems by putting the load between the 11.1V from the battery and my kill switch circuit? No other design changes necessary?  Edit 2: I see what I have to do now, I think. Will post results when remake it"
ECE,3ciaip,24nm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Notice that you did the exact same thing with every other transistor; you placed the load on the source, so you have a cascade of incorrect FET configurations.  If you're using this as a killswitch (with the intention of it being used for a safety application), I would strongly suggest just finding a nice contactor and using that for power switching instead of your FET. You can perform coil triggering and latching, as well as contact monitoring with your Arduino."
ECE,3ciaip,24nm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I redesigned my circuit http://i.imgur.com/3bOAfeK.png (The fuse is actually between the battery and everything else)  And it's working great except for the fact that the MOSFETS I have don't actually switch at VGS = 5V. I'm assuming this has to do with input capacitance? So when I place 5V on my circuit at the Arduino input, nothing happens. If I place 11.1V on it, the FET turns on and power is killed. Any ideas? Besides buying a new FET, like this one: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213"
ECE,3ciaip,24nm,2,Fri Jul 10 01:02:39 2015 UTC,"Look at what you've done with the FETs driving the relay coils; you still have the relays on the source pins of the FETs. You cannot have it there, for the exact same reasons stated in my previous post. Take the bottom FET for example. Assuming the FET turns on fully and has negligibly small resistance, the current through the relay coil will be 11.1v / (220 + 178) = 11.1v / 398 = 28mA. That means the source pin sees a voltage of 0.028 * 178 = 4.98v referenced to common. This means that, with a 5v input from your Arduino, Vgs = 5v - 4.98v = 0.02v, effectively zero, meaning the transistor won't be turning on. You need to have the source pin solidly connected to common and connect your relay coils to the drain sides. This ensures your source pin is always referenced to 0v regardless of the current your FET is conducting."

ECE,3ceuew,sci901,2,Tue Jul 7 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"Audio engineer. Work with rock stars! around live music! all the time!  Why it isn't glamouras as you think: 1. You work very very long hours (80 hour weeks are common) 2. You are required to have a large amount of technical knowledge, yet start getting paid so little it often amounts to less than minnimum wage 3. lots of physical labor, seriously tons of it. A professional live sound company spends far more time moving and transporting gear than it ever does working with audio. loading and unloading semi's. 4. that brings me to the next thing, it is best to be a professional driver, tons of driving, not always reimbursed for it. hours and hours of driving at all sorts of odd hours 5. crazy hours ""Oh you had a bar gig on saturday and will get home at 3AM? Sunday morening Load-in at 6AM don't be late""  6. 99.99% of the time you will work for artists you aren't into. 7. (if the list was in order this would be number 1) You will ALWAYS be the first person to blame no matter what goes wrong: Guitarist can't get his shit to work? ""sound guy fucked up my shit"" Band showed up two hours late for load-in? ""sound guy too long to sound set up so thats why the show started 5 minutes late."" Power goes out? well it worked fine yesterday what did you do? long list of shit like that.  8. You end up working every weekend all weekend and most major holidays. Sure you get to work at concerts (keyword is work) but afrer a while your friends just stop calling because everytime they do you tell them you can't hang out. 9. but you don't just work weekends the rest of the week is spent fixing gear, keeping track of finances (being self-employed YAY) and scheduling gigs/managing details for future gigs. Seriously after going back to a 40 hour work week I was shocked at how much more free time I had in life, I was baffled at why people complained about 40-hour work weeks. sooooo much easier than what it was like working long odd hours as a sound engineer.   Don't get me wrong super fun job, but for the amount of knowledge you need to have, the number of hours you need to put in, and quite frankly how hard and both mentally and physically demanding the job is does not come close to matching the pay.  (disclaimer I don't do this anymore this was before my engineering degree but it is seen as very glamorous and is very not)"
ECE,3ceuew,lowdownporto,2,Wed Jul 8 00:48:54 2015 UTC,"I did a bunch of that work on the side before I got my EE degree, for a company that supplied audio/lighting gear to concerts. 99% of my time was spent repairing broken things.  Putting new ends on cables that got taped to the floor, then pulled up by someone grabbing hold of the connector. Repairing amps which had the metal case dented and pushed against the PCB. Macgyvering together new rackmount ears out of angle iron because a rack of equipment got dropped off the end of a truck, and the gear was needed before proper parts could come in.  And for some reason, whenever you place speakers anywhere where the public can get at them, invariably someone will push their car keys, a stick or whatever they can find through the grille and poke holes in the drivers. Or piss in the ports.  That work helped pay my tuition, but looking back, fuck that shit."
ECE,3ceuew,gmarsh23,2,Wed Jul 8 06:26:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did a lot of the same work man. speaking off falling off a truck. one time was loading a semi full of vertec, and the general manager is all like ""this truck was backed up poorly, I am going to straghten it out"" so he does a decent job fixing, but he is a perfectionist, so he pulls it back out, pops the clutch, and all the speakers come rollling off the semi... they had to head to a gig out of state the next day that turned from a 8 hour day at the shop into a 14 hour day at the shop real quick.   Honestly reparis in the shop was like the easiest part, the worst was the long hours and labor, and then getting home at 4am for shitty pay.   On the other hand being self-employed ina field related to EE was actually pretty useful for school don't you think? I mean if I need more time to study I just text some buddies and get someone to take my gigs for the weekend. If I am broke I ask around to see who needs a tech and find more gigs for the weekend. Also the hours prepared me well for staying up all night and doing complex work. I can be exhausted all day long but I always get a second wind at like 9pm now... actually creates problems now but was great for school, and lets be real when you were studying signals and systems and things like convolutions and fourier transforms and what frequency responses meant you were probably all like ""this makes perfect sense to my"" while all your classmates were all ""this is soo abstract! this makes no sense? what is going on this is so hard!""

ECE,3chq57,raptorboi,3,Wed Jul 8 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"I did hardware verification as my first internship just two summers ago, and we had a setup similar to what you said. For me it was direct post-silicon on wafers rather than a board so all verification was done with master probe cards. Ideally the probe output was sent to a Teradyne with a C/Verilog master verification environment that would apply forces and read output, but that machine was scheduled for decommission well within my internship schedule.  The alternate handicapped setup consisted of manually hooking GPIO headers from probe cards to an FPGA board that performed data modifications such as serdes/ADC/squashing/etc. FPGA output went to a PLL-controlled logic analyzer where we could freeze signals. An alternate GPIO output went to a Labview environment for on-computer verification of analog qualities in situations where it was needed.  All overvoltage and ESD testing used an internally-designed PCB that had some stuff to assist in analog measurements with NI's hardware switching matrices. If anything that PCB saved a lot of effort in signal conversion and noise reduction for better analysis."
ECE,3chq57,420Blaze1t,3,Wed Jul 8 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of hardware and tester involved.  What you are describing is a ""rack and stack"" custom solution which is often used for low cost but generally isn't a general purpose thing - usually a one-off testing setup.  There are other types of testers, either board or IC testers, which are ""generic"" in that they can test almost any kind of DUT (device under test) architecture or type within a certain class.  This include broadly IC tester and board testers.  Of these, there are subspecialties such as memory, logic/CPU, mixed signal or analog.  ADCs after a fashion (usually they are constant voltage or constant current circuits that use ADC but require additional analog circuitry for ranging or accuracy).  Timing generally requires specialized digital driver circuitry that allows for programmable precision delays - you find timing by sweep the input or output until it fails.  You detect failures using test vectors for stimulus and response."
ECE,3chq57,mantrap2,3,Wed Jul 8 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Designing stations (rack and stack) for automated hardware testing is exactly what I do for a living. Here are my main steps:  1) Figure out what needs to be tested. This is determined by the specifications given to you by the hardware designer. Your end goal is to prove the DUT (device under test) hardware performance is better than the spec.  2) Choose the hardware to do the testing, preferably automated to reduce technician interaction time. (dmm to test voltages, currents, scopes to test AC waveform shapes, frequency counters for clock verification etc) There is a whole world of analog and digital test equipment to choose from. The general rule of thumb is the spec on your test equipment has to be at least 4x as good as the spec you're testing to. The hardware you choose will vary wildly from product to product, but its good to try to keep common test hardware between different products. That way you reduce cost by using 1 test station to test multiple products.  3) Design the interface to connect the DUT to the test hardware you just chose. Keep in mind the real high end test hardware usually has only a small number of inputs, but your DUT may have many many outputs. High performance automated switching is usually required again to reduce technician interaction time. I've created simple, cheap PCBs to act as connector adapters. I've also designed $50k multiplexers that route 100+ DUT channels to multiple single-input test hardware   4) Write the software that performs the test. The goal here is to have your technician be able to not only figure out if a DUT is a pass/fail, but to fix it if its bad. That means splitting up your test in meaningful ways that would be helpful to someone looking at the system or circuit schematic. I've seen a lot of LabView, but imo LV is a horrendous way to write tests. I mainly do it all in C#. No matter how complex the circuit or system is, the test interface must be simple to easy to use. Reducing test time is very important when you're making 1000+ measurements. Test smartly.  5) Train the technicians on how to use your station and software. Support the technicians if they run into issues and don't know what to do to fix the hardware. The better you write the test, the less you'll have to do this.  I maintain our whole product line (30+ products) of high speed digital bus testers. They are all unique products, and I managed to design a single tester that runs them all! Engineering!"

I cannot comment on the job market for advanced, research-type DSP positions. However, embedded programmers who are knowledgeable about DSP are in high demand. There are few programmers with exposure to both embedded systems and the theory of digital signal processing. An understanding of the math and algorithms involved is required in order to write useful software test procedures that verify correct operation, or to be able to change the algorithm around to make it easier to compute efficiently (like reducing the precision, or approximating hard-to-compute functions). You will not be doing DSP 100% of the time though, or even most of the time depending on the project you are assigned to.

However, that's not to say you can't work with RFICs as a product/apps/test engineer with a B.S or M.S. Design is a challenging world and i'd bet few M.S programs provides students the possibility to tapeout an RFIC circuit. The PhD is the most certain route to getting a design gig in RFIC, imo."
ECE,3c6lel,haneef81,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Are you currently working in the RFIC field? What about getting a gig at a small company and gaining experience there, would that be equivalent to PhD in this field?"

ECE,3c6lel,CylonGlitch,-5,Sun Jul 5 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"Every PhD engineer I've hired has been some of the WORST engineers I have ever worked with.  Most of them I've fired.  Most recent was a guy who got his PhD from MIT; he was at the company 2 months before everyone realized he didn't really know engineering.  SOME parts of engineering could use a PhD (Semiconductor Fabrication Engineering) but most of the PhDs that I've seen who are successful are those who went back AFTER 5 to 10 years experience to get their degree.  It is one thing to know the algorithms for analog design, another to know how to process them in hardware.  Most people who come out with PhD's and no practical experience are book smart, not real engineering smart).    As for the salary, it's not that bad.  But it sounds like a 10 to 20 year experience salary unless you're a super hot shot who knows how to really hustle and make things happen.  (so few of those)"
ECE,3c6lel,Evidence_Of_Absence,7,Sun Jul 5 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"Most people who come out with PhD's and no practical experience are book smart   I always hear this on this sub.  Serious question--where/how do you find these people (other than at MIT, apparently)?  Every circuit design PhD/PhD student I've worked with (either in industry or while I was in school) was working on real-world projects during their PhD and taping out those designs.  Most of them were working on industry-sponsored projects.  It was very practical.  Sure, you might not get exposure to some of the real-world stuff like designing for process variations because you have to worry about yield and cost, etc., but it's far from ""pure theory"" so to speak.  And what they do and don't have experience in is immediately obvious from their list of publications."

I said in my other comment ITT that I disagreed with the general advice in this thread that a PhD was the de facto way to go for RFIC design.

That's a possibility, but it's been the same for most of the engineers I know; they all say the same thing, most PhD's aren't worth the extra money or effort because they end up doing a lot more theoretical work.  Going back almost 30 years now when I was in graduate school I had a girlfriend who was going for her PhD in electronic design.  She was brilliant, thought the work was too easy even though she was at an ivy league school.  But we would go to the lab together and she would get stuck on simple things because she would calculate out that we needed a 3223.3332 ohm resistor and it didn't exist.  I tried many times to explain that we don't deal with ideals, we have to deal with real world components and with parts that are within 10 to 20% tolerances.  She never could wrap her head around that, it would drive her insane when I grabbed a 3.5k ohm and threw it in and said, ""Close Enough.""  :D    Most recently I hired a PhD graduate from UCLA (Computer Science) to write some test code for hardware that was being developed.  After 2 months, he had not written a line of code, just ""planning it out.""  I wanted to fire him then, my boss said no, she'd work with him.  After 2 more months on the project he STILL had not yet written anything and was working on the proof of concept document.  Even worse was when he started from day one, I gave him code that did 90% of the job, told him to learn it and improve it.  He refused to even look at it, if it wasn't his code it wasn't good enough.  Four months after being hired he was fired.  We just couldn't take it any more.  He wanted to be in charge of the software department, not coding.  He's fresh out of his PhD with a chip on his shoulder a mile high and working for a small company.  We didn't need his kind.    He may have been a smart guy, but he was too stupid to realize that the real world didn't revolve around him."

At least with a PhD you generally have proven that you can work independently to solve problems. Specifically with analog IC design, you don't get your degree without taping out a chip. Now, you don't have to go through full production level testing, etc., but you get a chip out the door. That's more than most BS or MS grads have done.  I work with at least four other PhDs, not including my own, doing mixed-signal IC design. None of them are anything but stellar engineers doing world class work.

M.S. vs. PhD... you should have time to figure that out for yourself along the way.  But I disagree with the other posters here so far saying that you need a PhD.  I was swimming in job offers (for RFIC design, RF test, and analog design) with a non-thesis M.S. from a top 10 school, although I had a good bit of RF experience from undergraduate research (measurement, some design with a few tapeouts, but mostly of very simple test structures, DC circuits, etc.) and a non-design internship at a major defense company.  I see no reason why a thesis M.S. from a good school/research group would have an issue going into this field.  Keep in mind that a PhD closes some doors as you have to justify your pay for a (usually very specific) set of skills.  Not sure what point in time you're referring to, but $150k would take a bit of experience.  Even in the bay area (higher salaries due to cost of living) I'd expect starting salaries of $90-$100 for a good M.S. candidate, and another 10-15 for the PhD."
ECE,3c6lel,sankeal,3,Sun Jul 5 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"I have a PhD and do mixed-signal IC design. Probably half of the design team I'm currently working with has PhD (one is a professor who contracts with us part-time, one if a former professor). An MS should be sufficient for RFIC design. Honestly, what is often more critical is where the degree comes from. There are certain schools that companies target for their talent. That's not to say that you can't get a job without a name brand school on your resume, but it certainly helps to get your foot in the door.  Some will tell you only to get a PhD if you want to do research, but that's not the only reason to go for it. I don't do research (not academic research, at least). I got a PhD more as a personal goal and to have the opportunity to possibly teach someday. I don't regret making that choice in the least.  As for the MBA, I agree with others that say you should wait on that. That would be a degree I would only get if I wanted to veer off the technical path and go more into the business side of things.  $150k is not unrealistic for 10 years in industry. I make well above that (including bonuses and stock) and am less than 10 years out of grad school."

However Any employer will certainly prefer real life work experience since you are an undergrad.   It is fairly easy to get a job as an ECE.

ECE,3c6iy6,sensors,8,Sun Jul 5 10:56:37 2015 UTC,"Hello -  I work in the SATCOM industry. One thing I'm not sure people understand is that satcom is a very wide field.  Let's for instance take something like internet, or broadcast TV, though this would be true for weather satellites, or any sort of sensor satellites..  Someone has to design the entire system.  How do we get from the internet / media source (earth somewhere) to some kind of gateway, to a satellite, to the correct user? This involves an insane amount of hardware / software / systems engineering / mathematics.  Think about an FM radio and then magnify it.  You need something digital to deliver the ethernet packets to the gateway, software that converts those ethernet packets to a specific format based on the the specification you're using (WiMax, some DVB-S variant, etc), then you need to implement that specification (encoders, modulators, etc..), something that goes from digital to analog and all the requirements around that.  Then the signal needs to go through analog amplifiers and mixers and an antenna before going to the satellite.  Now we're at the satellite.  Who made that?  What type of electronics are on there?  What type of limitations?  Somebody has to design the satellite, taking into account radiation, limited power, etc.  Is the satellite active (changing the signal somehow) or is it basically a mirror reflecting the signal? (bentpipe)  Now okay, you have a bunch of user's data shooting from space.  Who does it go to?  Somebody's dish on their roof.  But now you have all sorts of problems!  The dish on the roof and the modem in the house don't know the exact timing from the satellite, or all the terrible things that happen to the signal as it goes through space.  And encoding / modulating is easy, demodulating / decoding is far more complicated.    I think I've started rambling, so let me summarize: If you want to work in the satcom industry, there is a good chance there is a field for you.  Do you want to do antenna design? We use that. Do you want to do analog design? We use that.  Do you want to do FPGA work?  We use that. Do you want to do embedded software?  We use that.  Do you want to do low level linux / driver work?  We use that.  Do you want to make applications? We use that (satellite systems aren't set and forget, they require configuration management, and someone needs to make the applications to interface with that). Do you want to do board design?  We use that.  Do you want to sit around and play with matlab all day and make underlings crazy with your absurd dreams?  We do that but you should probably get a phd, or at least study the field for a while.  There are opportunities to travel, advancement, etc, but most of that is going to depend on the specific company.  You will probably find this true in most fields.  Entry level position wise, nobody will hire you to design a satellite system out of school.  Find a niche that deals with communication systems, (RF analog component design is a good choice...lots of old people and not a lot of young people seem interested in it), be good at it, and apply at satellite companies.

Make sure to apply for the specific thing that you want to do (Programmable logic, rf design, etc.) And state how you are both good at and wish to get better at that field, rather than just say you want to work in SATCOM.  In regards to your other questions... It varies. Pay is competitive with other tech companies in my area. I travel a bit to do testing. However, there are people who do a lot more traveling and people who never travel. Advancement opportunities again will vary between companies, between departments, even within different groups. It's honestly like any other tech industry, except the product is usually government related/needs government approval."

ECE,3c6iy6,capsule_corp86,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"SATCOM is very broad.  You can easily get into that field with an RF focus, an antenna focus, a communications focus, possibly a DSP or controls focus, software, the list goes on... if it's a company that does everything from the IC design to board level to system level to actual payload and satellite, they need EVERYTHING.  It's an entire electrical system with RF/microwave communications and the digital/software control needed to make all that work in a way that makes sense.  Plenty of non-EE positions too."

Try to visit with the prof early on in the semester so that if there are student grants in your country then they are still available.   I am not sure about the informal volunteer thing you are proposing.  They would probably be receptive I guess.

ECE,3c46te,nycheights717,3,Sat Jul 4 16:41:06 2015 UTC,What is your current education level?     If you already have an engineering degree I would look for subject specific continuing education courses and try to get your company to send you to them.  I've taken week long courses in both protection systems and SCADA over the course of my career.  That type of course is enough to get you started and then its up to you to learn on the job and learn through your own research.  Having a diploma or certificate won't make you an expert. Building a body of work and demonstrating your competence to your management and your peers will.  Ultimately experience and deep knowledge is what makes you an expert.  SCADA and Protection experts are hard to find in the market so your company should be willing to spend training money to develop from within.

ECE,3c5w91,yoyoguy123,7,Sun Jul 5 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"The confusion probably stems from the early RISC research from Berkeley in which some significant effort was spent showing how to do multiplies in SW, allowing all instructions to execute in a single cycle.  In their (very specific) case, it made sense to not have a HW multiplier, since it probably would not have fit on their chip (and thus follows the ""RISC philosophy"" of only having ""simple"", or reduced, instructions in the ISA).  Since then, thanks to Moore's Law, multipliers are fairly cheap to include, and all non-trivial ISAs since then have multipliers.   Of course, it's also quite possible for a CISC ISA to have a multiply instruction, but not actually include a hw multiplier!  Instead, the processor implementing a CISC ISA could rely on microcode to generate the uops to perform a multiplier using just the regular integer ALU."

ECE,3c5w91,fakieswitch,5,Sun Jul 5 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"The hardware multiplier had nothing to do with CISC or RISC its simply about the instruction sets which are used. In RISK you only have the most basic of functions, add, move etc. For CISC you do have a multiplication instruction but it doesn't have to be done on a hardware multiplier that is the key point. The multiplication can be done the same way you do multiplication in a RISC chip but it gets done after one instruction."
ECE,3c5w91,lovelikepie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:51:33 2015 UTC,"I'm probably lacking at this but does RISC necessarily not have a hardware multiplier (like implemented in an adder tree/Dadda)? I thought multipliers can be implemented in either architecture as long as you have some sort of instruction for it. If you have a mult instruction, then depending on whether your chip area is sufficient you can have a treed hardware multiplier or some sort of shift-add method."
ECE,3c5w91,SuperImaginativeName,4,Sun Jul 5 03:58:50 2015 UTC,"ISA and implementation are divorced from each other through the abstraction layer.  You can have a hardware multiplier in both, and you can have a hardware multiplier in neither.  The relevant question is whether (in this case) mult has an opcode or not.  The ISA can have a multiply operation and implement it using micro-code that is actually a series of additions.  As an example, x86 is generally a CISC ISA.  It has an operation called REPMOVS which copies X bytes from address A to B.  Basically an array copy.  x86 micro-processors generally don't (probably never) have a piece of hardware that does REPMOVS.  Instead, its broken into several micro-ops (copy byte, decrement, test).  However, you as an assembly programmer use the REPMOVS operation and the hardware does whatever it wants, so long as it copies bytes."

ECE,3bzhta,SidJenkins,13,Fri Jul 3 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.  Almost all computer motherboards have a temperature sensor on them to detect air temperature.  You can use this to compare against your cpu temperature to see how much heat the cpu is actually outputting.  You can use software like speedfan or realtemp to read out the values.  You will also find that quite a lot of things in your pc have thermistors on them in one form or another, hard drives usually have some kind of temperature sensing too.  It can be quite illuminating to see how hot your computer is actually getting."

Maybe they copied the pad design off something that does have a polarity?  I suspect it's easier to copy/paste a capacitor pad than have to design a thermistor one from scratch.  It might be for test-probe polarity...  If you are testing on-board with probe testers, you have to pay attention to the components on the other end of the trace...  maybe to indicate which way the chip is expecting the current to flow?"

Generally academia is 5-15 years behind what being done ""right now"" in industry and is 5-15 years into the future on blue sky technology.  The ""window of now"" is only handled/explained by well by those who are manufacturing and using the technology in economic practice.  Writing books takes a long time which is why there is a lag or dearth of books.  And there isn't much money in ""tech books"" because the audiences are both very small and diffuse in specialized knowledge.

The exposed copper should look very clean, while the un-exposed areas (covered with photoresist) should be dark and not-porous. However you could have a similar problem if you simply didn't develop for enough time. That's why pictures would help diagnose the problem a little better."
ECE,3bxda3,LT_Mako,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds like under-exposure.  What are you using to expose?  Proper time is about 5-10 minutes with a fluorescent lamp a few inches away from the board.  You should see a faint pattern in the resist even before you develop.  Make sure that whatever you are exposing through doesn't absorb UV and take any covers off the lamp.  Tracing paper and window glass worked the best for me when I used that method a long time ago.  Some types of plexiglas absorb UV, so that might be your problem.  If the exposed resist doesn't come off completely in the developer (red shiny copper), the board obviously won't etch properly.  It helps to dip it in the etchant right when you think it's done to see if there are any parts where there is still a thin layer of film (they'll be a different color).  Also, my advice would be to not waste your time with this crappy method.  There are places that will make professional-quality PCBs for well under $30 (e.g. http://dirtypcbs.com/).  That is less than what it costs to just buy the consumables for the DIY method, and you get plated-through vias and soldermask and proper solder plating so the board isn't a nightmare to solder.

ECE,3bvast,Intuiton,11,Thu Jul 2 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man, lemme give an overview, and then go waaaaay too far into detail, as this is kind of my area of expertise.  Im guessing you are getting downvoted because this is a very, very complex questions, and maybe a bit more software oriented than /r/ECE normally covers.  The question you asked is kind of like ""How do I connect to the internet with my device?"". It seems like a somewhat simple question, but there is a huuuuuge amount of detail that goes into answering it, and probably can't be fully covered in a couple reddit posts.  Some of the first things to cover are what ""Real Time"" and ""Real Time Operating Systems"" are, and probably even what an ""Operating System"" is. Lemme break this down for you from a reeeeeeally high level.  ""Real Time""  From a very high level, having a Real Time system means that you guarantee that a particular event is handled in a certain amount of time, as measured by seconds, milliseconds, etc. For example, lets say at a Coffee Shop, you GUARANTEE that within 10 seconds of a customer entering your coffee shop, they will be greeted by a Barista. Any longer than that, and you would be failing to handle the real time demands of your system. A similar thing works in electronics. If you have some sort of safety system, you could be making a guarantee that an alarm goes off, or a safety system (like a shut-off) will happen within a certain amount of time after some event.  Operating System  Most people are familiar with some operating systems, like Windows or Linux. These are great at handling many things at one time, and managing subsystems like Networking, User Input, Display, etc, and making sure they all handled at the same time. However most of these operating systems make no real-time guarantees. If you plug in a USB device, it might notice it in 10ms, but if its really busy, it might take 10 seconds to notice. Thats a factor of 1000 longer! For USB devices, thats probably not a big deal, but if you were expecting the computer to shut off electricity to a dangerous system as soon as it notices a USB device, that could be really bad.  Real Time Operating Systems  Real time operating systems work similarly, but they allow you to make guarantees, like a USB device will always be noticed within 100ms, always. The trade off here is you usually have to make an engineering trade off. If you make too many guarantees for the amount of resources you have (CPU time, Memory, Hard Drive space, etc), you are likely to fail your real time guarantees. This usually involves triggering some sort of fail-safe, such as if the system is overloaded, shut off all potentially dangerous things, or anything we werent able to appropriately monitor.  Making Real-Time Guarantees  An RTOS is NOT required to make real time guarantees, but it generally makes it easier, especially if you are making more than one or two kinds of guarantees. Also it is not generally possible to just ""add an RTOS"" to an existing system, it usually would require a pretty substantial re-design of your software to work inside of a real-time system.  Another poster here said ""interrupts"", and that is the general way to handle real-time guarantees in embedded systems without an RTOS. An Interrupt is a piece of code that says ""when this event happens, DROP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING, and perform this response"". That sounds great, but what happens if you make two guarantees? what if the second event happens while you are handling the first one? What if the event is complicated, like when you get a data packet over the serial port, then you shut of a system? Then you have to think about what is the maximum delay in processing a message over serial, then responding to it? Its a pretty complex field.  I'd be happy to go on and on, but it might be helpful if you gave us some more information. If you are a student, I would be happy to even go into more detail here or in a chat somewhere. If you are an engineer in the field, designing a safety-critical embedded system, you really, really are in over your head here (for now), and you should put some significant research in, or hire a real-time embedded engineering expert.  Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions."

ECE,3bvast,divinemachine,2,Thu Jul 2 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"Your question is really quite broad in its scope, but I'll try to answer in a useful manner:   You need to define what ""real time"" means. There are things that may be ""soft real-time"", ranging up to events that must be handled in ""hard real time"", where failure to respond within a hard deadline would result in loss of life/property (for example: you're detecting shoot-through current in an H-bridge circuit, and have only a few hundred microseconds to cut the main contactor to avoid frying a motor or your power electronics.) If you're NOT using an RTOS, the simplest and fastest answer might be to use interrupts. However, this is hardware-dependent. Some MCUs have features in hardware like ""analog watchdogs"" that trigger an interrupt in response to a certain voltage threshold, or programmable debounce on a GPIO interrupt when some pin changes state.    Either way, this still doesn't guarantee you'll respond to the event in time. Most likely, your system will have other interrupts enabled, and you need to address how you'll handle a mission-critical event that occurs WHILE you're in an ISR: Once again, hardware presents an easy out. Some MCUs have an NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller) that lets you prioritize the vectors in your interrupt table when you set it up. You might want to make use of such a thing, and analyze your system to make sure you're not caught in an interrupt storm."
ECE,3bvast,more_amps,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"Jahmez and more_amps are pretty much on the ball here.  You will have to make use of a interrupt priority here, and ensure that the mission critical event is handled as the highest priority."

So there's much less time for analog.  There's also just not enough time to go over everything in general, so schools stick to the fundamentals with the expectation that you'll learn on the job later.

The hope is to tackle solely electrical projects - substations, wind farms, solar.  This video here gives you an idea of grounding/earthing analysis can be so important. Imagine a wind farm producing electricity, the substation seen around the 17s mark distributes the power generated, at around the 27s mark a fault occurs, at the 30s mark a color is emitted from the ground - this is where grounding/earthing analysis software can determine step and touch voltages. With this software you can determine whether the grounding is sufficient such that your protection devices will work properly and open in time, as well as, ensure no one can be harmed by the large fault current permeating through the earth - hence the different shades of colors in the video. There are safe voltage levels as defined by IEEE standards.  I hope that makes sense. I typed it up rather quickly - but that's pretty much as I see it.

ECE,3bo4yf,scubascratch,2,Tue Jun 30 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"Ok I have given this a bit more thought after looking at the Lepton datasheet the essential spec are the resolution is 80x60 pixels, the frame rate is just under 9 fps, a pixel is either 14 or 8 bits. So the streaming raw bit rate is 80x60x9x8 (345.6 Kbps) or 80x60x9x14 (604.8 Kbps). This is if there is no compression. The frame rate and resolution are so low that you could easily use software compression with a number of codecs depending on your platform. If you use uncompressed data, there are RF modules that might work ok:  Digikey has a lot of RF modules but when you start drilling down to higher Xmit power and higher data rates and a module not a chip and in stock  There are 14 results. They range in price from $29 - $233, but most are around $35-$45 for 1 unit (you need at least 2).  I have not used any of them. I am partial to microchips zigbee 802.15.4 modules, but they did not come up in this search possibly because I restrict to data rates > 350kbps.  There aren't really 14 different things here, actually only 5 choices in a couple configs:     Laird RAMP modules, 500kbps (actually may be only 230.4kbps), 2.4GHz, 18dBm output power, mystery modulation, $37, claimed range: ""Outdoor Range FCC - 2.5 miles (4km)CE - 0.6 miles (1.0km)""     Murata FHSS, 460kbps, 2.4Ghz, 18dBm, FHSS/FSK, $233, claimed range: ""Indoor - 450 to 900 ft, outdoor - 3000 ft with dipole antenna, more than 6 miles with gain antennas""     LSR siflex, 1 Mbps, 915mhz, 24dBm, zigbee/802.15.4, $48, claimed range: ""Long range: 2 miles""     Microchip RN-131 wifly, 1 Mbps, 2.4Ghz, 18dBm, 802.11b/g, $36, claimed range: ""The transmit range can be up to 330' (100m), depending upon environmental considerations.""     Artaflex AW24RUH, 1mbps, 2.4Ghz, 21dBm, DSSS/GFSK, $29, claimed range: ""Outdoor LOS range of more than 1Km""  The Laird and LSR devices have pretty good range vs price. The LSR has 2x or 4x the data rate of the Laird device, so it would be easier to cram the raw data. I have used other 802.15.4 devices and they can work well. It is interesting that all the devices are 2.4ghz except the LSR which is 915 mhz. I would actually expect 915mhz to be less crowded in the U.S. Some of the interfacing on these will be dead simple serial line replacement, some might expect you to frame the data and use registers. This is ok since your source data is inherently packetized.  It might be important for you to get a pre-certified (FCC part 15) solution so you don't have to seek further licensing. I didn't check which devices were pre certified. Usually 892.15.4 with integrated antennas are.  The LSR looks like the leader to me, followed by the Laird, the Araflex, then distant last is Murata because of outrageous price (may be worth it though, only device to claim >6 miles which I think you said is a goal right at 10km. You would need some impressively active pointed high gain antenna pointing home, like a space probe, to get that max range. Or a very large dish at the base station end). The wifly I think is a non-starter because of range.  So those are some options you can consider."

ECE,3bnowa,mantrap2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"The transistor type doesn't change the fundamentals of amplifier design - only some of the specifics of biasing and expected impedances/drive/gain.  The basic design steps are identical for vacuum tube, BJT, MOSFET.  The big difference is in biasing especially is if you are doing direct coupled design (e.g. on-chip).  For discrete, capacitively coupled, not so much different.  Secondly, usually JFETs are only used in the input stage because of their noise and impedance impedance.  99% of the amplifier chain is BJT.  See the internal schematic of any JFET op amp.  I've never seen an ""all JFET multi-stage amplifier"" - there isn't much advantage to JFETs after the first stage as BJTs tend to have a better gain-bandwidth product at higher power levels.   For this reason, the load characteristics are generally BJT-defined or possible MOSFET-defined.   BJTs give better high power drive for class-A/AB linear.  MOSFET can be better for ""digital"" classes like class C --> H.  Load compatibility is about compensation and impedance choices.  Generically the same for all transistor types as this is hybrid-pi defined and thus topologically the same across types.  Usually you drive with common plate/collector/drain because it's the lowest impedance output configuration so you get the best loading features for resistive and capacitive loads."

Unless you have specs for your core, you'll either need to measure the saturation flux density (google "" inductor saturation tester"" - not hard to make), or you'll need to make a conservative guess based on the core material (1T is pretty safe for transformer steel designed for 50/60Hz operation).  From there you can get the minimum number of turns required to sustain whatever volt-second product you're putting on it.  As for the actual winding method, it's tradeoffs - spreading the winding all the way around the core gives the best magnetic coupling and lowest leakage inductance, but increases interwinding capacitance, and makes galvanic isolation more difficult. Primary one side and secondary the other gives easier isolation and lower interwinding capacitance, but worse coupling. For a steel core transformer at low frequency, spreading around the full core would be my recommendation."

To clear up some of your USB questions:   The Cypress EZ-OTG CY7C67200 is USB 2.0 ""compliant"", but only works at ""full speed"", (12Mb/s) not the maximum ""high speed"" (480Mb/s) of USB 2.0. It has nowhere near enough bandwidth for uncompressed video, which is probably why they are no examples for it. You cannot use it without implementing some heavy compression on your FPGA. The Cypress EZ-USB FX3 (not EZ-OTG as you say) is a USB 3.0 device, so works up to 5Gb/s. To get that kind of bandwidth out of your FPGA or other attached device, it uses a wide (32 bit) parallel bus called GPIF-II.  You probably don't want to wire that high speed bus up yourself with jumper wires, and the FX3 comes in a BGA package, which is why your DE2-115 board has a HSMC connector (High Speed Mezzanine Card), and Cypress nicely sell this adaptor to make the connections from your FPGA board to the FX-3 dev kit. You keep asking how to implement UVC on a NIOS-II. Don't do that. The reason Cypress sticks ""EZ"" in the name of all these products is that they all contain an embedded processor themselves to implement your required USB stack, for a full USB to Parallel, UART, SPI etc solution. The EZ-OTG contains an 8051, and the FX3 a much more powerful ARM chip. This allows your FPGA to just throw data over the parallel bus without having to care about how USB works. You do need code for the USB chip though, but I think Cypress provide some examples.  The examples provide for UVC on the FX3 either do not support 5.0Gb/s, or are for the CX3 which is like an FX3 but with a camera specific MIPI CSI-2 interface instead, so you have some work to do. Before you ask, no you can't just use the CX3. Your FPGA can't do the weird signalling levels of CSI-2 without some expensive adaptor chips, and then you would have to make yourself the lovely HSMC board Cypress already have for the FX3. I suspect you won't need to make too many changes to the CX3 code to adapt it to the FX3 though. As /u/scubascratch is right to point out, you don't really need UVC. It may be easier to use a custom USB class and write a simple program to dump the data to a file on your receiving end. Things like LibUSB allow you to do this all in userspace without having to write drivers. I don't know how complex UVC is to implement though, so if you can add it to the FX3 really easily, obviously thats a better choice. There is also the older EZ-USB FX2LP which is like the FX3, but USB 2.0. This is the heart of the Salae Logic, so fleabay has a lot of FX2LP boards sold as Logic clones. If your incredibly tight on budget, you could use one of those, and they are a bit simpler to understand. You get much more headroom with the FX-3 though, enough for 1080p."

You could use YUY2 and just leave the U and V bits empty, or use Y800 or Y16 and send directly.

What video source will generate gray scale at that channel width?  Even at 800x600, it is a shit ton of continuous data.  800x600x60x24 = 691,200,000 bits per second. That is without any protocol/framing overhead or FEC. This is way too fast for USB 2 as a raw stream. If you meant 8 but grayscale, it's ""only"" 86 Mbps. That's on the high side for a video stream (8x an SD DVD, about 2x a blurry) but can be crammed through a USB 2 connection uncompressed with an isochronous pr bulk endpoint.  Were you planning to use video compression? That will get you down to USB 2 data speeds at least. There are several off the shelf HDMI -> usb solutions that can capture 1080p and squeeze it through a USB 2 host connection, but quality may be impacted.  Can you describe how the captured video will be used? Making a USB video source may be more work than wanted if you just want to push the bits up to an app that then does processing on the data.

Understand precision/footprint/speed trade-offs.   'DSP slices' are your friends.

This will probably characterize your transmission the best since this is what they use to find faults and what we used to use to characterize unknown impedances.  Also, you said that when you disconnect the 600 Ohm device, the power jumps. Well, if you have mismatch, some power will be reflected, whereas, if you have a 50 Ohm device at the end the power will get absorbed. Is there some significant electrical length after the splitter? I'm thinking that the 600 Ohm device messes with the reflection coefficient and causes some reflected signals.

To measure input impedance, you'd first measure across the coax + resistor in series (resistor connected from V+ to coax) and then just across the coax. Not sure about the physical limitations of what you're doing - it might be hard to actually set up that experiment.  Source: Paid attention for most of an electronic amplifiers course this semester just gone.

ECE,3bjssh,GrendelKeep,2,Wed Jul 1 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Your receivers do not combine the way you think they do.  Your reflection from the splitter should be minimal since its hopefully designed to hopefully present a transformation to its input line.  But each of the output coaxes and receivers will reflect power on their own independent of the other back down the line.  So, you have say a half power splitter, the 300 ohm receiver is going to reflect more of its power back into the splitter.  When you disconnect it, the reflection increases since now that port is an open and not terminated correctly.  Some of this power could cross to the other port.  Usually splitters have good isolation between output ports, but something will proably cross. I would think you need a proper 300->50 ohm transformer to stick in line.  Then, as suggested, with each device disconnected one at a time and a power meter terminating the other sitter out port, measure what you are getting."

When the client has finished, it returns the object to the pool rather than destroying it; this can be done manually or automatically.  Object pools are primarily used for performance: in some circumstances, object pools significantly improve performance. Object pools complicate object lifetime, as objects obtained from and returned to a pool are not actually created or destroyed at this time, and thus require care in implementation.

ECE,3bjwe5,ArtistEngineer,3,Tue Jun 30 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"Your question is a bit confused but let's see if I can clarify things by starting with some basics. These are the main areas of memory in a typical application:  text/program - this is your code, it's usually in Flash/ROM and is read only. e.g.  printf(""hello!"");   data - this is where your variables live when declared as globals or static, it's in RAM. e.g.  static int foo;   stack - this is a temporary space to allocate variables that only exist for the duration of the function, it's in RAM. e.g.  void bar(void) {     int i;     // space for i is allocated on the stack,     static int j;    // space for j is allocated in *data*      i = 123;     j = 456;     printf( ""%d, %d"", i, j );     return;         // space for i is now available for re-use by other functions which need to use the stack     // j will remain with this function, but only in this function, for the duration of the application }   heap - this is where malloc() and calloc() get your memory from, it's in RAM. e.g.   struct my_struct    // only exists as a definition, no memory is allocated by this {     int foo;     int bar; };  struct my_struct *my_struct_pointer;    // depends where this is, could be stack or data memory   At this point struct my_struct does not exist except as a definition. The memory to hold the pointer to struct my_struct exists but it doesn't point to anything. If you were to dereference this pointer, it would point to random memory.  Let's create some memory:  my_struct_pointer = malloc( sizeof(struct my_struct) );    // allocate memory from the heap, and assign it to our pointer   or  my_struct_pointer = calloc( sizeof(struct my_struct) );     // allocate memory from the heap, set the memory to ZERO, and assign it to our pointer   Now I can fill in the structure:  my_struct_pointer->foo =  123; my_struct_pointer->bar =  456;   If I don't want this structure in memory, I can free it:  free(my_struct_pointer);    // the memory pointed to is freed, but the variable still exists   If I don't want to use malloc()/calloc(), I can put the structure in to the global/static space. e.g.  struct my_struct my_structure;    // this is now fixed, I can not free this memory.   I can set values like so:  my_structure.foo = 123; my_structure.bar = 456;   if I want to refer to this structure with my pointer, I have to pass the address of this structure to my pointer.  my_struct_pointer = &my_structure;   And, like before, I can set the values:  my_struct_pointer->foo =  123; ... etc"

ECE,3bjwe5,flyingGinger,3,Mon Jun 29 20:55:59 2015 UTC,Hm okay so the following is totally valid?:  Typedef struct { int *a; int *b; }someStruct_t;  someStruct_t *someStruct; int c=42;  someStruct->a=c;
ECE,3bjwe5,Firadin,4,Mon Jun 29 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"No.  Not quite.  someStruct_t someStruct; int c=42; someStruct.a = c;   OR  someStruct_t *someStruct; int c = 42; someStruct = (someStruct_t *) malloc(sizeof(someStruct)); someStruct->a = c;   Strictly you don't have to initialize c to set the pointer legally.  But you can't be assured of what's in c and thus also what the pointer sees.  So setting is good.  When you do ""Type * var;"" you ALWAYS have to create/have a real object to have *var point to (it's a pointer because you declared it *var).  So you'd have to malloc/calloc an instance of someStruct_t and set the pointer to that, or reference another local variable.  Otherwise, if you simply declare it without a ""*"", you've instantiated a full instance of the struct as a local variable.  No need to malloc.  But you have to reference members differently:  with ""."" rather than ""->"".  someStructure->a is equivalent to *(someStruct).a which first dereferences the pointer to the in-memory struct and then accesses the member variable.  With the non pointer version, it's already the ""in-memory"" form.  The last bit: when you declare someStruct_t myStruct in { }, the scope is only in the { }.  E.g. in main() { }, the scope is only in the block.  Other blocks (e.g. in called function blocks) can not see it.  You can do global but avoid that - it's non-reentrant which can cause problems.  Or you pass a reference to the function as an argument:  myFunction(someStruct * theStruct) { printf(""%d\n"", theStruct->c); }  main() {  someStruct s1, *s2, *s3;  s2 = (someStruct*)malloc(sizeof(someStruct)); s3 = &s1;  myFunction(&s1); myFunction(s2); myFunction(s3); }   The one advantage of using a pointer and mallocing is it stays around until you free or the program ends (or you overwrite the pointer and create a memory leak)."
ECE,3bjwe5,psycoee,2,Mon Jun 29 22:01:00 2015 UTC,What if the stack can't handle the amount of structs he is trying to store?
ECE,3bjwe5,odougs,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:50:45 2015 UTC,Uh this is a pretty dangerous answer.  Always calloc/malloc if you're passing data around from function to function.
ECE,3bjwe5,krista_,2,Mon Jun 29 23:15:44 2015 UTC,You can still just use a pointer for this.

ECE,3bjwe5,obsa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"There's nothing dangerous about it, and it's not any different from any other object lifetime bug.  If you malloc at the beginning of the function and free at the end, you are subject to exactly the same restrictions as putting the object on the stack, except now you also have a huge performance hit for no reason at all.  The only reason not to use the stack is if the object is large, or it needs to be used outside of the function's scope."
ECE,3bi25v,YourPsychoTherapist,14,Mon Jun 29 11:56:37 2015 UTC,I'd throw in a 10A fuse if you've got one on hand and need the thing up and running again.  Blown fuse may point to another failure though.
ECE,3bi25v,gmarsh23,6,Mon Jun 29 14:33:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on what is downstream the fuse. The cable typically has a current rating. Don't put a fuse in that is rated higher than the components downstream of it. 12 to 14A isnt a big difference if all of the components downstream are rated at 15 or 20A.    I once observed a guy replace a fuse with a piece of wire. I told him he was crazy as fuck. He basically told me to stuff my EE degree up my ass, he does it all the time."

ECE,3bi25v,SrSkippy,20,Mon Jun 29 12:53:29 2015 UTC,"To expand, there is a reason that the fuse was 12A. It'll melt past 12A flowing through it, saving the parts from any high-current damage. Which means that, with a 14A fuse, you'll safely allow 12A through. Not ideal, but depending on the circumstance, it may be good enough to allow you to run the device while you go buy a 12A fuse.  Fuses and other protective measures are typically overdesigned - I.E. (not necessarily true in this case, nor is this the only way to overdesign) using a 12A fuse for a 6A nominal part that can safely take up to 13A and unsafely take up to 16A before breaking, so a couple A above spec might be ok until you go immediately buy a 12A.  I would still suggest just going to get a 12A first though.  If you get a LOWER rated fuse like a 10A fuse, you'll be safe (you're overdesigning more), but there's the chance that the part uses 10A and then fails under normal use because of that."
ECE,3bi25v,My10thAltAccount,11,Mon Jun 29 14:20:35 2015 UTC,And on the note about over sizing: you're much better off putting a lower rated fuse in there and seeing if it can run. No risk of damage to anything other than the fuse in this instance.
ECE,3bi25v,My10thAltAccount,3,Mon Jun 29 16:45:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for the thorough explanation
ECE,3bi25v,Wetbung,3,Mon Jun 29 16:02:50 2015 UTC,This is the best explanation.
ECE,3bi25v,bradn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:49:56 2015 UTC,If it's crucial that the laminator run immediately you're probably safe. But the very next thing you do if you put a 14a fuse in is go out and buy a 12a fuse. Just don't let the machine jam. Fuses are just for idiot proofing.
ECE,3bi25v,Runenmeister,8,Mon Jun 29 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"Well, fuses are for more than idiot proofing. They often protect against fires. It doesn't take an idiot to cause an over-current situation. Putting in a larger fuse/wire/penny in place of a blown fuse is where the idiot comes into play.  OP, if you follow this advice, make sure you have a fire extinguisher handy."
ECE,3bi25v,Runenmeister,2,Mon Jun 29 15:38:22 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I will make sure to do just that.
ECE,3bi25v,bradn,2,Mon Jun 29 13:43:52 2015 UTC,"To add a bit of rationale:  The 12A fuse was probably selected to protect in instances where the device is in an already hot room, the line voltage is near the maximum allowable, etc.  14A should be safe enough as long as things aren't otherwise near the breaking point.  It is less than a 20% increase.  If things didn't melt/smoke with a 12A, they won't start on fire with 14A.  But... it is still important to replace soon with a 12A fuse, if for no other reason than to make sure the machine is working properly.  If it blows with a 12A fuse, something is still wrong with it and continuing to use it is just asking for problems.  Also be sure to replace with the same type of fuse (fast blow, slow blow, etc).  Putting a fast blow 14A fuse in place of a slow blow 12A fuse might lead to the fuse popping as soon as it powers up, if it draws a brief surge.  Likewise, a slow blow in place of a fast blow may not protect the circuit."
ECE,3bi25v,alle0441,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:23:40 2015 UTC,Is it common for a fuse to just blow from age? How do I tell if my fuse is slow blow or fast blow?
ECE,3bi25v,Aaronplane,2,Tue Jun 30 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"Typically the datasheet or packaging will tell you the characteristics of the fuse. If you don't know/have that information available, go with fast blow first if you want to be safe. I'd be willing to bet it won't matter for your particular problem.  Fuses are usually just small pieces of metal designed to melt after reaching a certain amount of current flowing through them, there isn't usually much complex circuitry involved (fancy fuses have LEDs that emit bright light when the fuse is blown, that's really nifty IMO! You'll see that a lot in newer car fuses). They don't age much. But older fuses, just like anything else, might oxidize and be out of spec after so long. Just depends, really.  Fuses are also not perfect, just like everything else. They do have inherent failure rates (where failure here is defined as the fuse blowing at a lower current than spec'd at), just like everything made ever."
ECE,3bi25v,alle0441,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"Good to know! I got these at NAPA, just some loose fuses in plastic packaging.  I can't imagine having an led to tell me my fuse blew, it seems pretty apparent when I look at it."
ECE,3bgnga,ignamv,3,Mon Jun 29 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"This is perfectly possible. There are many areas of EE which you can easily enter as a physicist.  RF and analog IC design are already far on the ""pure EE"" side of things. You may also want to look into sensor technology and MEMS in general.  Semiconductor technology has also been a classic physics/EE inteesection area, but I would discourage you from entering too close to the base level here as there is a very strong drive for consolidation in that area right now."
ECE,3bgnga,kken,2,Mon Jun 29 05:16:02 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate a bit on the consolidation of semiconductor tech?
ECE,3bgnga,Laogeodritt,3,Mon Jun 29 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"Many companies are going fabless and are instead manufacturing at a foundry. Many of those are located in Asia.  There is also a lot of M&A activity right now. f.e. Broadcom->Avago, Altera->Intel, Freescale->NXP, Micrel->Microchip, Spansion->Cypress, IRF->Infineon, IBM Semi business-> Globalfoundries (At a minus 1 billion purchase price), ISSI->Some chinese investor  Most of these usually lead to closure of fab sites and reduction of both direct and indirect personnel in manufacturing."
ECE,3bgnga,kken,3,Mon Jun 29 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"Your best bet for finding a position would be parlaying your master's experience into a benefit to whichever labs you apply to.  You can have some latitude in how you might describe that benefit, but if your work has been on high energy particle physics and you're applying a position that focuses on clean room fabrication you might have some trouble.  The biggest concern I would have for someone like you would be dealing with whatever qualifying exam you would have to deal with at your new university.  This exam varies wildly from university to university and could be a real problem for you.  You need to be careful about universities that would have take the qualifying exam within your first year and have heavy emphasis on core coursework.  There will be some overlap with physics (upper level math, probability and statistics, and, naturally, E&M), but there would still be a large amount of material you have to learn in a short amount of time."
ECE,3bgnga,sumg,2,Mon Jun 29 04:57:36 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on what area you focused on when you were studying Physics. EE itself has many fields so if you've been working on semiconductiors as a Physics major then a relevant EE program on semiconductor devices (not so much about IC design) maybe your best bet.  RF/Analog or even digital IC design will require a strong foundation on circuit analysis and signal theory which you maybe able to enrol as an undergrad subject but there are suceeding advanced courses you may need to take which might take a while.
ECE,3bgnga,BoogerInYourSalad,2,Mon Jun 29 12:01:30 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, areas that would particularly apply to a more physics-oriented education (obviously depending on your specialisation in physics):   VLSI process and semiconductor research, as mentioned. Companies designing new processes, for instance. You'd probably want to start off looking at the materials or devices level. Signal integrity: research related, for example, single event upset could benefit from an E&M perspective for modelling. High-reliability applications like automotive and aerospace may benefit from such research. RF: Not too much ""plain"" RF stuff. I guess some EMC might benefit from an E&M physics perspective, but I don't know how active that field is in terms of fundamental research, compared to circuits-level stuff and following the existing regulations and cookbooks. Optics. There's a lot of stuff happening right now in terms of semiconductor optics (photodiodes, optical modulators, integrated photonics), using both III-V semiconductors and silicon. The materials aspect of this may be a way for you to enter at this level. Our physics department have been working on some nanomaterials and nanoelectromechanical devices (e.g. graphene transistor-like devices). I don't know if any EE departments might be working at that level too—but MEMS/NEMS and semiconductor materials might be of interest to you.   IC/RFIC design tends to be very oriented toward the circuits aspect, using existing technologies, so unless your research focuses on an applied devices level (e.g. SEU on a particular kind of circuit, or device/quantum-level effects on a circuit), chances are it's not immediately relevant to your background. That may depend on the nature of a particular research area or project, though.  For those kinds of areas, you'd probably want to take basic electronics, either digital electronics or intermediate analog electronics (current mirrors, cascodes, frequency-domain model of transistors, stability, loading effects and feedback types, etc.), semiconductor devices (if you haven't taken something similar already—for us it was semiconductor crystal structures, basic quantum mechanics and separable Schrödinger's wave equation solutions, infinite and finite potential wells, semiconductor doping, electronic band structures, p-n junctions; the second course goes further into BJTs and MOSFETs at a devices level). You may also want to be familiar with signals and systems theory and fundamental control systems, for more circuits-level work.  All three of the electronics courses I just mentioned are covered by the Sedra & Smith Microelectronics textbook. Gigantic book, though."

ECE,3bgnga,scubascratch,9,Mon Jun 29 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"Many combined MS/PhD programs actually prefer people with just a BS -- there is a lot more runway to get someone up to speed with a project.

ECE,3bgnga,frozenbobo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:29:36 2015 UTC,"Ok so maybe it will take another 1+ year to get to the BSEE level?  Perhaps I am hazy on what an EE doctoral program student is expected to know when entering. It seems like it would be hard to keep up with the EE students if they have several years of groundwork.  I guess I was just reacting to the idea that a masters level EE education can be crammed into a few courses at the end of a physics masters program. Hobby level electronics can cover quite a range from wiring some EL wire onto a shirt, to designing boards with SOCs to pilot UAVs.  Earlier in another post a BSEE was bitching that the CS grads were getting more money than they deserved because his degree was harder. ""My degree program was harder than that, so I can just pick up a few courses to fill in any gaps and I'm just as good"" <-- kind of had that flavor, may not be the case here.  I hire engineers in the tech sector. When I  interview a BSEE candidate I expect her to know: 1. Ohms law / Kirchhoff / Thevenin 2. AC & DC power (voltage sources, current sources, transformers) 3. Basic analog circuits and passive components (R,L,C) 4. Diodes and Transistors (BJT vs MOSFET, P- vs N-, cutoff/linear/sat) 5. Basic digital circuits (logic gates, clocks, simple buses) 6. Intermediate analog circuits (oscillators, amplifiers, feedback, resonance, regulation)  MSEE should also know: 7. Basic RF (oscillators, AM/FM modulation, mixing, demodulation, filters) 8. Intermediate digital circuits (microcontrollers, sensors, memory, ADC/DAC, FPGA) 9. Signals (measurement, noise, impedance, transmission line, balanced signaling) 10. Controls and Sensors (open/closed loop, PID) 11. Basic DSP (FIR, FFT) 12. Look at a schematic and explain it  They will definitely have several projects on their resume demonstrating application of hopefully half of the list.  It seems like a physics PhD would be just as valuable if pursuing semiconductor design / fabrication, but I don't hire in that industry so I could be wrong.  Maybe I'm unrealistic about these expectations."

I got work in an engineering firm that does work for industrial plants - part of my job is Instrumentation and 'controls'. It is my experience that in the real world most problems require very little if any control theory knowledge, but require more domain knowledge about the thing you're actually trying to control. There is very little incentive to 're-invent the wheel' in most cases, so you slap a controller with what is more or less a self-tuning PID on it and call it good, on to the next thing. The rare situations where this is not sufficient are also usually the cases where companies are looking for someone way more qualified than an undergraduate just getting out of school. Additionally, the controls you learned about in school are (unless you did an extremely unusual amount of self-study) largely irrelevant, and only form a basis for understanding of more advanced topics. The hardest thing to learn as a new engineer is that you are mostly useless in terms of technical contributions, at least for the first year or two."

In my experience, most real world systems where you might want to apply control..   aren't working systems in the first place, and so there's a whole lot of shit ya gotta do before you get to do control. Sometimes things extremely unrelated to control (things I found boring and that I wasn't very good at). Very often the plant you talk about, G(s), is of a big complicated physical system somewhere else in the country, and suddenly the job just gets lots less interesting. You don't get to do much control here. already have a control system implemented that is some variant of PID, and your boss doesn't want you to waste time messing with the tried and true solution that ""works just fine"". You don't get to do any control here either.   If you are like me, you probably first got interested in controls because of the interesting theory. I thought of control systems as a more of budding framework for reinforcement learning with recurrent neural networks, even though they were never mentioned in a class or (undergraduate) textbooks. This did not serve me well at all in finding a controls job. For something like what I really found interesting, I should have done computer science probably.  Instead, keep control theory in your back pocket when the rare chance arises that you actually get to do feedback in applications of Signal Processing / Data Science. There's a data explosion right now, and signal processing people should be able to find lots of interesting jobs. And although DSP is very relevant, even DSP texts/lit. can often limit the discussion to constant sample rate, and although you can make the proper adjustments, it's a symptom of starting the discussion from the wrong starting point imo (though I don't do embedded controls). So on top of DSP, I'd learn to do more statistics and general data science."

For ""control systems"" in the sense of control systems theory you probably learned, usually controls is simply a tool in your bag.  Ditto with DSP.     There are often jobs that require such knowledge but seldom do you do ""only DSP/control systems"" 8 hours a day.  So ""DSP engineer"" may pop up but more often it's another job title that simply requires DSP.  Ditto for control systems.  Usually there is ""something"" that is being build that happens to use these along with numerous other engineering disciplines.  A simple example: searching for ""DSP"" on Keysight's job site gives 6 hits, only one of which is actually titled ""DSP engineer"".  This is typical.  Major areas:    military/defense.

ECE,3be1bm,vkuruthers,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:23:22 2015 UTC,I've heard this advice from somewhere else as well; I'll definitely be looking into it when the time comes.
ECE,3be1bm,raptorboi,2,Mon Jun 29 00:51:57 2015 UTC,"Also when you're learning SPI / I2C, take note of the way the protocol works.  There will be delays & certain bit-streams that have to be correct and in the correct order to get anything at all.  And as vkuruthers said, UART is a must to learn.  It's probably the easiest to learn as well.  Once you get these down, you will have the knowledge to tackle a lot of hardware.  The rest is just software engineering really.  I'm sure you know:  Firmware is writing low-level code (hardware communication) that will allow higher level code (your main program) to do things.  Arduino doesn't have an official i2c header, so feel free to write one.  People have made them and they work if you get stuck.  Embedded systems are basically something like an RTOS or even a state machine running everything. A state machine is easy to code, but requires a bit of planning to get all the states correct, else you will get stuck on one state or it doesn't advance correctly.  An RTOS will make use of interrupt timers as you will want to switch between tasks at a certain interval (like running a lot of programs on one processor, like your PC). You will need to learn how to pass function pointers for this, as well as context switching to save what each function variables are set at, as well as where the function was at when the interrupt happened.  /r/ECE is here to help if you need us.  ^"

ECE,3bdbjh,Evidence_Of_Absence,33,Sun Jun 28 03:43:48 2015 UTC,"Complex numbers are used all the time in power systems to handle the two types of power: real power and reactive power.  These two types of power are almost always present with alternating current power systems.  EE's use the real number system for the real power component, and imaginary numbers for the reactive power component.  Now, that doesn't mean that reactive power is ""imaginary"" - it is very real in the real world.  So, why do EE's use imaginary numbers for representing reactive power if reactive power is in fact a real thing?  It's because real power and reactive power are orthogonal to each other, which means that real power flow doesn't affect reactive power flow, and reactive power flow doesn't affect real power flow.  And, knowing that ""real numbers"" are orthogonal to ""imaginary numbers"" it only makes sense to use real and imaginary numbers (and the associated mathematics) for real power and reactive power.  When you combine real numbers with imaginary numbers you get complex numbers.  This then applies to power flow:  when you combine real power with reactive power you get complex power, which EE's call ""apparent power"".  Basically you are free to use the complex number system when you have orthogonal signals.  There are many many other types of orthogonal signals and systems in the world and complex numbers can be used for representing them.  Here is another electrical engineering example:  an AC signal is typically represented using a complex number because AC signals have a ""magnitude"" and ""phase"" component.  The magnitude and phase are orthogonal since the magnitude doesn't affect the phase and the phase doesn't affect the magnitude.   So, once again it only makes sense to use complex numbers to represent an AC signal.  That way you have one ""number"" that contains all the information required to represent it, and you can then add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc., AC signals.  Think of an AC signal as a vector, which has magnitude and direction.  You can't just add the magnitudes of vectors without taking into consideration the direction.   Vectors, therefore, can also be represented using complex numbers.  Hope that helps!  Edit, fixed typo"
ECE,3bdbjh,substrate80,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:29:37 2015 UTC,Does the abstraction hold if you square the power quantity though? Like why wouldn't you just use vector notation or something?
ECE,3bdbjh,dire_faol,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"If for some reason you wanted to square complex power that does not mean it would become negative real power in the way that j2 = -1.  This is because reactive power is not actually imaginary - it is real.  We just ""put"" the reactive power quantity on the imaginary axis, and ""put"" the real power on the real axis.  The imaginary number ""j"" is not actually part of the reactive power, it is just associated with it so that we can do our maths.  So, if we had 20 Watts of real power and 10 VAr of reactive power, the apparent power would equal √(202 + 102) = 22.36 VA.  Notice how I did not include the imaginary number ""j"" in that calculation?  That is because, again, the ""j"" is not part of reactive power - us humans just stick reactive power on the imaginary axis.  So, in the example above if we wanted to square the 10 VAr of reactive power, we would just get 100 VAr.  Real power and reactive power themselves are not vectors since they don't have a direction component.  You might say ""hey wait a minute, real power points left/right on the complex plane and imaginary power points up/down on the complex plane so of course they have direction!"", well that's only because us humans put these quantities on these axis - it doesn't mean they really have a direction component in real life.  Power quantities are not like AC signals with magnitude and phase, power quantities are magnitudes only."
ECE,3bdbjh,substrate80,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"pretty much all power calculations are based on using complex plane representation of a rotating vector quantity. You could use vector notation, but you'd be ignoring convention, it would take anyone else way longer to check your calculations, and you'd have to rework all kinds of existing material, particularly if you started getting into more complex areas like motor control and relaying."
ECE,3bdbjh,idiotsecant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:22:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, but I more so meant, if you square reactive power, do you get negative real power? Or does the tool of complex numbers not really fit the physics?"
ECE,3bdbjh,dire_faol,3,Sun Jun 28 11:52:47 2015 UTC,"complex numbers not really fit the physics   Complex numbers are really just a way of encoding the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid. As long as you're operating at one frequency (i.e. doing linear things), the algebra of complex numbers exactly matches that of the trigonometric signals.  So, with that said:   if you square reactive power, do you get negative real power   I assume this assumption comes because you know that j2 = -1. This doesn't mean that in general squaring a quantity means anything physical. So no, in general Q2 =/= -P.  What did you think squaring a power quantity would do?"
ECE,3bdbjh,Althaine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter what it does? It's just math. If I square reactive power, I'll get negative real power squared it sounds like. If that's not valid, it seems like it's using the wrong tool just to represent orthogonal quantities when something like a vector would do fine."
ECE,3bdbjh,dire_faol,4,Sun Jun 28 12:20:51 2015 UTC,"Why does it matter what it does? It's just math.   When it comes down to it, the math must model reality. Complex numbers have a lot of useful properties that mirror trigonometric quantities. As it happens squaring a trig function (or multiplying a trig function by another trig function) gives you terms that include different frequencies and the abstraction breaks down. You wouldn't be any better off with vector quantities in this case.   If that's not valid, it seems like it's using the wrong tool just to represent orthogonal quantities when something like a vector would do fine   Because multiplication within the complex number field C has some meaningful properties that we like (multiplying by an imaginary number rotates the quantity, equivalent to a device that shifts the phase), whereas to get the same result using vectors in R2 we need to introduce objects that don't belong to the same space (rotation matrices).  I want to stress something that I don't think anyone made totally clear: the difference between phasors and complex quantities. Phasors are a complex number that should really have a rotating bit tacked on (exp(j w t)) but that we leave off for brevity and because it doesn't affect the maths. These are signals like voltage or current.  Complex quantities don't have a time dependence, but are still just complex numbers. These are things like impedance Z or complex power S.  Multiplying and dividing complex numbers with phasors and with each other is fine, although whether the result is meaningful depends on what you're doing (e.g. it wouldn't mean anything to multiply complex power S with complex impedance Z). Multiplying phasors is dangerous, because that is where the implicit frequency stuff breaks down. Dividing them is ok, because that's what gives the time independent complex quantities like impedance."
ECE,3bdbjh,Althaine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:33:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. My confusion was that it seemed like doing some sorts of maths would break some rules, and it seemed like that was just due to the use of complex numbers. So there'd be this big asterisk with what you're allowed to do with the numbers just because of the tool.  But if multiplying phasors is dangerous in general because of the frequency stuff breaking down, then there's a good reason that type of math could get screwy. Thanks for the help."
ECE,3bdbjh,dire_faol,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"Or like if you multiply two reactive powers, do you get negative real power? It doesn't have to be squaring. It's multiplication."
ECE,3bdbjh,dire_faol,2,Sun Jun 28 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's keep chatting about this for a bit.  First, 'reactive' power Q and 'real' power P are both real number quantities. They are the imaginary and real components of the 'complex' power S:  S = P + j Q   So if you multiply two reactive powers, you get a real number. A number which doesn't have any more meaning that multiplying two impedances.  Let's say you have a complex power S. You could multiply this by another complex number that represents some sort of 'phase correction' piece of equipment, although this other number is dimensionless - it isn't a power and it is more like an impedance (but impedance transform current to voltage, whereas this new quantity transforms power to power).  I don't work or study the power industry, so I don't know if they actually use this notation that I've just invented, but they do have things like capacitor banks that could be modeled by it."

That was before my ""real"" circuits class where the professor used complex values for current, impedance, etc (see this - the phasor notation keeps the frequency ω implicit). And also used Laplace transforms, etc.  A signal processing book that is keen on ""hiding"" complex numbers is The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing (it's available to read for free on the site, click ""The Book by Chapters"").

Old meters did this via a rotating needle.  New meters, such as Fluke meters, have a line meter under the numbers.  Now imagine how much more useful information could be represented if you did it in two dimensions instead of one.  This is effectively what you have when you use an oscilloscope.  Now instead of looking at a single metric (i.e. voltage), you can simultaneously process two metrics (i.e. voltage and time).  And look at how much more powerful that is.    Well, the idea of complex numbers is the exact same thing - except applied to mathematics.  Instead of a one dimensional number line (i.e. real numbers), we now use two dimensions (i.e. real and imaginary).  And by expanding our system of mathematics to be two dimensional instead of one dimensional, it becomes exponentially more powerful once you learn how to use it - just as an oscilloscope is capable of showing us so much more information than a voltmeter."

From frequency to time, it is quite obvious, without imaginary part, you would have no information about the phase of the sinusoidal. Knowing that depending on the phase, you would add at each time sample very different result (sinusoidal shifted).   Imaginary aren't really imaginary... Id call it ""hidden"".

Maybe this is a rant of some sorts, but I personally find EE material much more harder than CS, and it kind of bothers me that the future for me looks super dire, despite busting my ass as equally (or more) as my CS friends.   Pay isn't about what's conceptually harder, it's about who is more difficult and more expensive to hire.

If you wanted more money straight out of school, you should have found a internship or co-op. Experience is VERY important for getting into the higher paying EE fields.  You have the opportunity to make up your mind now going into your Master's. You can do a Master's in CS or CPE and get those starting salaries if that's what you want to do. Or if you truly love EE, you can do a Master's in EE and get more experience to get into the higher paying EE areas. Or, you can stay as you are and sulk about it, blaming the job market."

ECE,3bb9oa,radioboy2000,11,Sat Jun 27 15:53:35 2015 UTC,"Understanding how a FM radio works relies on how good your signals theory is. For instance, are you aware of how multiplying a signal with a sinusoid shifts the signal in the frequency domain? This is the fundamental way in which you can take a low frequency (20 Hz - 20 kHz) audio signal and transmit it using high frequency (100 MHz) radio waves.  Hence any receiver requires you to implement such a multiplier, called a 'mixer'. You can either do it discretely with transistors (or tubes) or you can buy prebuilt modules that do it for you. You'll also need to understand amplification and filtering circuits.  Something to look at would be a 'superheterodyne receiver'. Here's an example of one I found with a quick search."
ECE,3bb9oa,Althaine,2,Sat Jun 27 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Superheterodyne receiver:       In electronics, a superheterodyne receiver (often shortened to superhet) uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I.  Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle. At the cost of an extra frequency converter stage, the superheterodyne receiver provides superior selectivity and sensitivity compared with simpler designs.

ECE,3bb9oa,autowikibot,9,Sat Jun 27 16:32:11 2015 UTC,"I would suggest starting with something simpler, like an FM transmitter.  You can build one out of one or two transistors, it's easy to get it to work, and getting it to work well is difficult enough that you'll learn all sorts of stuff (particularly if you hook it up to a spectrum analyzer and try to get rid of harmonics and spurs).  Building a receiver is significantly more complicated and requires winding coils and other annoying stuff, unless you just take the easy way out and use an all-in-one radio chip (which is basically just buying a ready-made radio).  If you really want to learn how to build radios, get the ARRL handbook from your local library and look in there.  It has both theory and practical circuits for all sorts of communications circuits.  There are lots of ""canned"" circuits floating around, but understanding how they work is quite difficult (something like a regenerative receiver is incredibly complex to analyze, despite being essentially a one-transistor circuit)."

ECE,3ba0np,Hurricane043,2,Sat Jun 27 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"The hardest part of ""Verilog"" is having the digital design knowledge to be able to even create the design to describe. Writing the Verilog itself is pretty easy in my opinion. If you can't draw out an entire design on paper, then you shouldn't even be touching Verilog. And once you have the entire design drawn out, it takes knowledge of a few basic rules to make a transfer. For example, knowing a mux will become a conditional.  Personally, I've taken two digital design courses. The first was very basic and was about simplifying boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, the premise behind elements like multiplexers and adders, shift registers, flip flops, creating finite state machines, etc. These are things you need to have foundational knowledge of to be able to apply to a design. My second class was based around Verilog and was the class in which I learned how to use those things to create designs.

Once you can code a state machine it isn't that big of a leap to code a state machine where each state is another state machine. You will start to get exponentially more variable, levels of state machines, and other annoying stuff to deal with, but it's really all the same basic building blocks used over and over.

Your storage system will end up braindead fucked though unless all interfacing is through the microcontroller to un-twist the data.  Otherwise the options are, experiment with cards, try 4 bit mode instead of SPI (sometimes the microcontroller inside handles this better even though it is much less efficient for the application microcontroller to deal with - very weird and inefficient CRC'ing that in particular is mandatory for writes), add a SPI RAM IC for buffer, use better microcontroller (hopefully with dedicated SD peripheral), etc.  For what it's worth, look for class 2 / class 4 cards.

ECE,3b500v,bradn,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:54:02 2015 UTC,I'm leaning towards using a better micro at this point. Would 4 bit mode make much of a difference in the write speed? From what I understand the bottleneck is the SD cards pause time between writes
ECE,3b500v,bradn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"That's what I've seen mentioned - I think what happens is that 1 bit mode may need more software intervention by the controller in the SD card where 4 bit mode has more hardware acceleration.  I'm not sure exactly why but there does seem to be a big latency difference on some cards.  Maybe they just spent more time optimizing 4 bit mode because that's what digital cameras and card readers use, and 1 bit was just kinda there for MMC compatibility, and stuff that used it generally isn't very performance critical."

It varies by card but in practice it takes between 1-10ms per 512 byte sector. I'm writing over spi at 4mhz, and the spi bus can go faster on the SD card but not the mcu. Writing the dates to the bus doesn't take long, but waiting around afterwards for the cards to be ready for another block takes longer and is quite variable.   Also-regarding ""writing small amounts of data very frequently"" hurting your throughput- sd cards have a minimum sector size that can be erased or written. On SD and SDHC I think it's always 512 bytes. So you're going to have to accumulate data in RAM for at least a sector to get decent performance.   Sorry I can't be more exact, high throughput is not a high priority in my application. I hope it gives you some useful ballpark figures.

ECE,3b500v,gargeug,2,Fri Jun 26 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"Using an MSP430 and the SPI flavor of SD I was able to get over 600 kB/s of data logging with a 1kB buffer, and likely could get faster. I went down this path, and my recommendation is do NOT try to use a filesystem like Fatfs. All of the overhead will kill you. And at the embedded level, your top-level code will have to do register access right there; no abstraction or you eat away at your speed.   The biggest trick I found was to use 2 512 Byte buffers. I had a timed sample frequency where I would just constantly fill a buffer until it hit 512B, then switch to the other and fill it. Then in pseudo-parallel, have one eat away at the buffers and write to the SD card. The reasoning is that at the end of the 512 Byte writes to SD, you have to close out the sector, which requires writing extra bytes to the SD card. With 2 buffers you don't miss samples. Just ensure that the rate at which you can write to SD is faster than the incoming data speed.  The downside of this is that the SD card is unreadable and in binary. But I just wrote a simple program that could transcribe the SD data in binary."

ECE,3b27g9,SrSkippy,2,Thu Jun 25 11:47:21 2015 UTC,"Part of my job is doing power in industrial plants - moving power around, and controlling motors, heaters, and lights, more or less. It's not the most exciting thing in the world. I also do industrial process control and instrumentation and I think that is probably more fun.    You can get power jobs just about anywhere, probably one of the more in-demand specialties.  Work-life balance depends on the company, and any engineer worth their salt is going to be continuing education forever, or you're going to be irrelevant pretty quick. I work in oil&gas, plenty of power demand there. There are power people who work in construction, utilities, industrial, all over the place. Somewhat boring with occasional bursts of awesome, basically like 99% of engineering jobs. They can, but I don't know why you'd want to! There are sectors where having a PE is a legit thing in power, and I think students now have to have a masters to take the PE? not sure. In any case, the masters itself is much much much much less marketable than a few years of on-the-job."

ECE,3b27g9,YoScott,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:07:50 2015 UTC,"I'm three years in as a substation design engineer (protection & controls) at a consulting firm.    I'd say that most consulting firm offices I've heard of are in smallish cities or suburbs of larger cities, while utilities are more likely to have offices in the city's downtown area. Rural jobs I know of are either at a power plant or the one engineer at a small co-op. Right now everyone seems to be projecting industry growth, and once you get in there's little pressure to get an advanced degree. Work-life balance varies by company, though I've been happy with my experience and I've heard that most utilities are really good for work-life balance.  Consulting is, in general, busier than working for a utility. I've had a good stretch recently, averaging barely over 40 hours for the past 6ish months, but this time last year I was just finishing up 6 straight weeks of 60+ hours. I've also had opportunities to be on site for construction, which are great experiences and a great change of pace. Not sure exactly what you mean by oil & sand, but I know the oil boom has caused a need for rapid grid expansion in ND and similar places, so there's definitely opportunities to get out to the oil fields. I think my job is pretty interesting, and doing work for a lot of different clients helps keep it that way. Most of the ""boring"" talk I hear refers to working for utilities, and part of that is that they are still mostly an older workforce, so not many coworkers to relate to. Also, I think part of it is the flipside of good work-life balance: there's just less to do.  I haven't found anyone in my company that manages engineers and doesn't have a PE. Even the executives (excluding CFO & CTO) are all former engineers.  A masters can help you get a job where you want to work. Everyone hired as entry level at my company over the last 3 years has had one or both of a masters degree or an internship either here or with a direct competitor. If you get into consulting you'll need to pass the PE, and your masters will count as a year of work experience (utilities are exempt from PE requirements in most states). Overall if you can get the job you want without the masters, it's probably not worth it, but I have my MSEE and I'm well aware it's the only reason I got my foot in the door.    EDIT: just wanted to add that the current replies seem to be from people who do industrial/building power, while my experience is EHV substations (115kV-500kV). Both are certainly aspects of power systems and I'm in no way trying to say one is better than the other, just wanted to highlight that because I think it accounts for a lot of the differences in our responses."
ECE,3b27g9,slowbie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"I'm interning at a utility company in the Midwest right now, so I'll offer what perspective I can.  To point 1 - I'm working in the state capitol, just about 10 minutes freeway drive from downtown.  To point 2 - This is definitely still a field where you can start and end your career working for the same company. The work-life balance seems great, and a lot of engineers where I'm at work a 4-10's or 9-80's schedule (I'm on 9-80's myself, probably go 4-10's when I've quit the singles life).  To point 4 - It can go either way, and it probably depends a lot on the company you're at and what group you're in. The stereotype is definitely ""boring,"" but there's an increasingly young workforce that would love to change that by trying new things.  The group I'm in is actually involved in what you could call a ""Big Data"" initiative to improve system monitoring/analysis/etc through synchrophasor data, and other groups are dealing with similar things through ""smart meters."" A lot of utilities are at least starting to use synchrophasors now, and presumably/hopefully that info will become a part of the operators' SCADA interface.  To point 6 - You'll probably get end up getting a master's degree at some point or another. You can definitely get a job with a bachelor's, but it's not really a terminal degree in the Power field. So it's really just a question of if you get the master's now and pay for it yourself or do it later and the company pays for it (but you're working while you get it)."

You can buy ribbon cable with twisted pairs, which you can crimp into a 9- or 15-pin Dsub, but I don't think that works with a 50-pin, because it has 3 rows.  You're going to have to procure a cable to go with your boards, so why don't you figure that out first. If you can't find an off-the-shelf cable, then you have to design it yourself, and you can use whatever pins you want.

ECE,3azxw5,odokemono,3,Thu Jun 25 07:05:17 2015 UTC,"I've built a 20 button remote control using that method.  Here's a couple of tricks I used:  I routed the output of the button matrix to the INT0 input as well as the ADC input with a 1 mega-ohm resistor as a pull-up instead of the 10K shown in the image so that any button press brings INT0 down and wakes up the µC from power-down mode.  Once the µC is awake, I turn on the pull-up resistor on the INT0 input.  IIRC, that was about 30K, a reasonable value to form the voltage divider with the matrix output.  I then do a couple of ADC conversions (the first after a wake-up is often wonky), then a couple more and average them, compare the value to a list of 20 values and select the closest one and return the corresponding button number.  There's also a routine which calls the button-reading function and does basic de-bouncing and auto-repeat.  After the buttons are let go (ADC==1023) for a while, I disable the pull-up and put the µC back in power-down.  Power-down only consumes about 0.05µA on the ATTINY84 I used, so that gives the remote over 10 years of battery life in stand-by."
ECE,3azxw5,gimpwiz,4,Thu Jun 25 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"Do you need all those buttons? Make sure you need them. Consider other ways to do the same thing with fewer I/Os. A matrix can work if you do it right, but makes things like interrupts much harder... Do you need to use an MCU that doesn't have enough IO? Use an IO expander. Usually these are very simple chips which simply have power, ground, a ton of I/O, and an I2C or SPI bus for control. Some might be configured as master devices which themselves alert your MCU on change; others will be slaves which you will need to poll regularly."

ECE,3b151h,1wiseguy,5,Thu Jun 25 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"Titles are tricky, especially with startups and smaller tech companies. Generally speaking, the I, II, III and so-forth titles are only really useful within a certain organization and don't really translate well from one company to another.  Startups and tech companies especially are notorious for throwing inflated titles at people in lieu of raising compensation, because it doesn't cost them anything.  In your case, my best advice would be to ignore titles completely. Build a strong network and find mentors in your field and area in order to get a better handle on appropriate compensation. $88K could range from underpaid to overpaid depending on your experience level.  The only real way to know for sure is to apply to many, many jobs all at once and push them hard on salary. You'd be surprised at how much upward room for salary growth you can get just by asking some companies, but you'd also be surprised at just how infrequently people actually ask. The trick is to not be cornered by a single offer. Once you have many options, you'll have all sorts of courage to press the companies on salary.  So shop yourself around."
ECE,3b151h,Construct,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"thanks for the insight. heres my situation: i have the 88k offer, but looking around on glassdoor i've seen level 2 salaries in this geographical area and in this company ranging from 89 to mid 90s and even low 100s.   how would i go about saying something like ""ive seen salary reports for this type of position at around 5-10k more than what you offered, can i have a more competitive offer?"" in a much more elegant and persuasive way?"
ECE,3b151h,Construct,5,Thu Jun 25 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"First, congrats on the job offer. Again, don't get too hung up on the titles at other companies, but it's good that you're gathering data points for level 2 salaries at this particular company.  That said, keep in mind that if you're going from level 1 to level 2, you're going to end up at the bottom rather than the top end of this company's salary range for level 2 engineers.  However, asking for a salary increase is possibly the easiest $5K raise you're going to get any time soon. It's possible that they'd rescind the offer and go with another candidate asking for less money, but in this job market it's more likely that they're eager to get the position closed.  Study up on the basics of negotiation. Not the high-pressure sales tactics and false-confidence mind games stuff you can some times find on internet forums, but the real type of professional negotiation where two parties work toward an optimal and amicable outcome that suits both parties. This is a good book to start with: http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0143118757/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435256349&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+to+yes  But for now I'm assuming you don't have much time, so here's the basic premise: Don't just ask for a higher salary for the sake of a higher salary. Present them with an honest view of your current situation and be flexible but also prepared to walk away if they don't hit your targets.  ""Can I have a more competitive offer?"" isn't very convincing, and they'll see right through you because you don't have a strong position. Instead, aim for something more like: ""I really like Company X and the innovative products you are making for Industry Y, but in my job search so far it looks like $88K is at the very low end of compensation for someone with my experience in a position like this. I'd love to work here, but at the same time I can't afford to pass up the significantly higher salaries that these other jobs are offering. Could we perhaps meet in the middle with a salary closer to $95K?""  Basically: Thank them for the offer, present your negotiating position, give them your target salary requirements, and see what they come back with.  Good luck!"
ECE,3b151h,timweezy,2,Thu Jun 25 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"From my experiences(mostly through recruiters), if I'm looking to get 5-10k more than the initial offer, I just straight up ask for 20k more. 90% of the time they meet me in the middle at 10k higher.

ECE,3b151h,hardolaf,3,Thu Jun 25 17:34:42 2015 UTC,As a rule of thumb it can't hurt to ask for more after an initial offer. Just don't ask for too much more. If you're already working at the company they have already valued you. Look up salaries on glassdoor maybe?

ECE,3awm2e,RalphieRed,10,Wed Jun 24 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"Write the code on a PC/mac to do what you want using an audio input waveform using the smallest possible number of multiplications (slow) and trig functions (super slow). Once you have a handle on how many of those operations you need, plus how to live with the least amount of memory, you will be in a better position to pick a device. I'm guessing the ATmega is just too slow for DSP work though. FPGAs are nice and parallel, but multipliers take multiple clock cycles and you will have to be careful about how you do your DFTs. You might just find that a Raspberry Pi with an audio input is good enough, and the development will be quicker."
ECE,3awm2e,bitdivision,4,Wed Jun 24 04:40:22 2015 UTC,"Whoah. Slow down.  This is a really simple project. There's no need for a full FFT on a guitar tuner, you simply need the main frequency component.  You can actually do this very simply. Here's an example:  http://www.myplace.nu/avr/gtuner/  And here's some code I found on github doing the same thing:  https://github.com/TheSmiff/AVR-Guitar-Tuner/blob/master/Guitar%20Tuner.c  150 lines.   I would implement this on an AVR first, and see if you can get your head around how it works. Microcontrollers are usually more useful for general applications than FPGAs, so the skills you learn will be very applicable to other projects. If you're still enjoying tinkering, then port it to your FPGA, you'll likely learn whole lot more."
ECE,3awm2e,RalphieRed,2,Wed Jun 24 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"Nice thing about trying that code on a PC is that you can examine the waveform and decide about the drawbacks of edge detection (noise immunity and harmonics off the top of my head).  You might be able to do a DFT slice or two with an ATmega, which is to say you could measure and compare the actual magnitudes of a small number of frequencies with a precomputed trig table. Not the full spectrum like an FFT. DFT slices would be immune from noise and harmonics. DFT of a fixed number of frequencies is O(n) instead of O(n log n) like an FFT.  Also, any excuse to learn about an FFT or DFT is a good thing for someone interested in computer audio processing."

ECE,3awm2e,furyfairy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:11:36 2015 UTC,Use the AT mega. FPGA requires too many external components and a lot of time developing and proofing peripherals already developed on the MCU. You're targeting audio frequencies which the Atmel is plenty fast enough (sample 7 to 10 times your highest frequency to get good signal resolution) as the highest audio frequency will be in what? 20 to 30 kHz. It's internal ADC should hit the  high 100kHz for a sample rate. Otherwise you could go external ADC with SPI. You'll get off the ground faster with the uC over the FPGA and the uC should have the FPU for digital filtering needs.

As an FPGA project it would be interesting, but basically you are implementing some kind of audio range frequency counter, and in the FPGA you would be highly likely to wind up using a soft CPU core and just writing it in software anyway, and having it take 10x as much power.

ECE,3awm2e,gmarsh23,3,Wed Jun 24 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"Do you really think it would be necessary to implement a soft cpu in the FPGA? I know I could probably throw together some filters and a preamp and have something functional, but I kind of want to take it step further."
ECE,3awm2e,gmarsh23,2,Wed Jun 24 15:16:35 2015 UTC,"Well it could be done with somewhat less than a full soft core, but to measure frequency at a minimum some kind of counter/timer will be needed, and then control logic, some kind of digital comparator to drive the tuning output display, a table of values for standard frequencies, some logic to deal with octaves (the tuner has to probably work across a couple octaves at least). Truthfully the AVR is not necessarily the ideal device either though because it is not powerful enough to do an FFT (actually this may not be true, there are FFT libs for arduino) so this means that the input signal has to be conditioned somewhat to be reliably frequency measurable. In order to use digital input interrupts and timers, the signal needs to be squared up. Otherwise the analog input can definitely be used, but counting frequency on a wavy input on an atmega128 is a bit of a challenge. The FPGA might be able to better implement some of the DSP functionality which would enable an FFT of the input, which is easier to turn into fundamental frequency without as much analog signal conditioning  So I guess 12 hours later I am thinking the FPGA might make this easier. The AVR probably would need more complex analog front end, where FPGA can enable more complex math to move the work into the digital space."
ECE,3awkty,DerpKaHerp,3,Wed Jun 24 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"This is a big question, so it's worth gathering advice from a lot of people both online and offline. I'd recommend bouncing these questions off of people who know you well in person as well. They may not fully understand the ins and outs, but it's still helpful to hear what people close to you see you doing. Some advice from my perspective:   Im currently a CNA working my way through to getting my own place and hopefully moving into school for a degree at some point. My main quarrel is over the three main degrees that get passed around here alot, CS CpE and SE.   The first question is: Why the career change? On one hand I'd encourage everyone to pursue the career that aligns with their passions. On the other hand, you need to be wary of the ""grass is greener on the other side of the fence"" effect. You'll need to think long and hard about whether health care is your thing or technology is your thing.   Ive been picking up a bit on C++ having three separate books to read from.   I'd pick one book at a time and stick with it. It might also be worth learning a higher-level language like Python first, because it will help you learn the core concepts of coding, application structure, execution flow, and so forth without getting bogged down in a lot of the low-level details that C++ will force you to work with.   In all honestly I see myself creating technology for the world. I want to apply principle not find it, which in that sentence alone should rule out CS but i hear I should do it because of the principles of programming.   Undergrad CS isn't really about discovering new ways to do things. It's about learning the theories and basics of programming. You're probably not going to be implementing sorting algorithms and red-black trees ever again in your life, but it's still very important that you understand the ins and outs of how they work so that you can apply them effectively. In that sense, CS is still very much aligned with your goals if you want to focus on software development.   My dream job like many others is to be a game developer and more importantly for a large MMO company like Arenanet. However I want to obtain a degree in something that will allow me to pursue more than just the video game industry.   The video game industry is not really a good place to be unless you absolutely love to work on games day and night. Turnover is high, burnout is common, pay is low, and it can really be a sad place to work precisely because so many people are desperate to work in the gaming industry at any cost that they'll put up with a lot of abuse. Unless you eat, sleep, breath, and dream game programming already, I'm sorry to say that this career path probably isn't for you. If you're serious about it, you need to be dedicating the vast majority of your free time to game programming right now.   I can see myself building robots and programming them as well, I see myself making weapons like the portal gun, or making drone that record like we have today. The main thing is I want to be able to design it, build it, program it.   We all do, really. But there's a massive gap between the people who dream it and the people who do it. Formal education can teach you the basics, but only you can teach yourself the self-discipline and drive that are required to accomplish these things. Companies that are working on the most exciting tech (drones, etc.) are going to be picking from the people who already do these things on their own, because there are plenty of them to pick from. A college degree is valuable, but it's not going to teach you how to execute in the real world.  In other words, what are you waiting for? The barrier to entry has literally never been lower, and you can pick up dev boards and other tools for the price of a pizza or two and start hammering out a prototype these days. Get on it.   I want programming to be a big part of what I do as well though, I dont want to sit around all day soldering components onto a board. I want to active engage in the finer workings of the project, I want to help make its hardware, and create its software that it interacts with.   This points to computer engineering for a degree. Think of it as half way between software engineering and hardware engineering. Look for embedded engineering type positions that require close interaction with the hardware. Or look to startups, where you have to wear multiple hats. But again, startups are looking for self-starters and you'll need to start building a track record of doing your own projects rather than counting on a college degree to take you across the finish line.  Also, you won't be soldering boards all day ever, unless you take a job as a lab tech or solder tech somewhere. Automated assembly is a given for even small-ish prototype runs these days. I barely touch a soldering iron except to make tiny board tweaks for debugging purposes.   In the end I personally feel CpE is the degree for me, but I want to be reassured I have the ability to find a job in programming or being in the game industry with such a degree.   CpE sounds right for the degree, but like I said above, the degree is only part of the equation. If this stuff isn't already your hobby then I have to wonder if you're really that interested in the career path. It's so easy and cheap to get started with Arduino, etc. these days that you should really spend some time giving it a try on your own to decide if it's really what you want to do in life. If it's not, you may find that the nitty gritty day-to-day work of engineering isn't as fun or glamorous as the idea of being a ""maker"" or whatever image you may have of engineering. It's hard work, but it's fun if it's what you love."
ECE,3avyk3,CrumbleBread,6,Tue Jun 23 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"I use (unlabeled) drawers and boxes like this one to store parts. I also have a spreadsheet to keep track of the different ICs I have kicking around.  For test cables, I have a nice system. I fashion some steel wire into hooks, and mount them in cardboard panels. I then tape the cardboard panels to the side of my desk. Cables can then be hung on the hooks. It's cheap and easy, and has held up for many weeks no problem."
ECE,3avyk3,alterB,2,Tue Jun 23 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"I bought akro-mills drawers and mounted them above my bench (not on the surface). I also bought a cheap Dymo USB label maker.  I have magnet strips for things like alligator clips, and some tools, and a hanging rod for tape, wire spools, solder (directly above the soldering area)  Through-hole resistors are organized by the first two stripes. that takes up about half of one cabinet, but it's totally worth it.  I have one tiny box labeled ""shame"" its for components that are unorganized, when it's full, take the time to organize it.  Ongoing projects get tupperware or similar boxes which are labeled and on shelves or under the (standing) bench.   Reference books and big spare spools are on high shelves just out of normal reach.  I'm not a neat freak, but having a place for everything, and spending the first 20 minutes of any project putting the last set of projects away is really useful."

ECE,3avck1,nat45928,16,Tue Jun 23 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"Please don't take offense, but I'm a bit concerned that you're working with such high power circuits without much experience in high power design. I'd strongly recommend enlisting the help of someone with experience in the field while you come up to speed, because small mistakes that you wouldn't think twice about in a low-power circuit can be catastrophic in a high-power system like the one you're working with.  That said, the primary considerations in choosing a conductor size are the voltage drop across the length of wire and the dissipation of the heat from ohmic losses through the wire.  You can calculate the voltage drop as well as the heat generated by referencing the resistance per length values of a table like you one you linked. The allowable voltage drop will depend on your application, but in an EV scenario the voltage drop will basically translate in to decreased efficiency and lower power output. You'll have to run some calculations (ohms per length * length of your cable + connector resistance) to see just how much this impacts your use case.  Heat dissipation and associated temperature rise are more difficult to calculate, because heat transfer away from the cable depends on a number of factors. If the cable is in an enclosed space with no airflow, for example, you will want a larger cable so you have less heat to dissipate. If the cable is in the open and exposed to ample airflow, you could get away with a smaller gauge wire as long as the voltage drop (power loss) was acceptable. At minimum, you need to be absolutely sure that the ohmic heating of your wire won't approach the maximum insulation temperature rating of the wire, or any other materials that will be near the wire. In practice, you want to keep the wire significantly cooler than these maximum temperatures to have ample margin for safety.  Also keep in mind that connectors and their associated resistance becomes a significant problem at these current levels. Poorly fitted or under-crimped connectors can add a relatively large resistance to the system. It can take some serious tools to properly apply connectors to these larger cables.  And as always, be absolutely sure that you have appropriate safety measures and circuit breakers in place. Shorting a high current supply to ground can be very dangerous, and higher voltage supplies can easily be deadly. Don't skimp on safety gear anywhere in your system."
ECE,3avck1,Construct,2,Tue Jun 23 20:36:16 2015 UTC,None taken. I am trying to learn the proper ways to size this type of system outside of these tables. In my case it is a 80-100kW peak EV powertrain. The pack is protected with an AMP+ service disconnect/fuse as well as multiple contactors inside the accumulator. Thanks for the quick detailed reply!
ECE,3avck1,rand000m,8,Tue Jun 23 20:46:04 2015 UTC,"The pack may be protected but if you have an under-crimped connection it will have high enough resistance to get hot with that sort of current.  Hot enough to melt insulation and possibly cause a fire. That's what he is concerned about, you don't understand all the failure modes and wire size is only one part of the puzzle.   Also, fuses must protects the downstream wiring. Your wiring needs to handle the hold current of the lowest value fuse in the battery pack, else you need to install your own fuse that is suitable for the wiring you are putting downstream of the pack.  I would encourage you to learn what you can, have a plan, show an expert your plan to review before starting and then let them check your work when it's done. You are definitely playing with big boy current when you start talking almost 400 amps."
ECE,3avck1,1wiseguy,3,Tue Jun 23 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"There are about 3 things to consider here:   Will the voltage drop be too large, either because you need a certain voltage at the other end, or you just don't want to waste power? That can be determined by a wire resistance table or by calculation or by testing. Will the wire overheat, to the point where it melts or damages the insulation? That's more complicated, because it depends on the environment. That pretty much requires testing. Is there a code that defines wire size, either by law or by agreement with some standards organization? You need to figure out who must approve your design, and see what rules they have."
ECE,3avck1,luckyleighton,2,Tue Jun 23 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"The page you have is fine.  It reads in the fine print:  In careful engineering the voltage drop, insulation temperature limit, thickness, thermal conductivity, and air convection and temperature should all be taken into account. The Maximum Amps for Power Transmission uses the 700 circular mils per amp rule, which is very very conservative.   The basic current carrying capacity is decided by the circular mils of the wire.  Then you have to factor in transmission losses (voltage drop) to assure your system will work.  Along with anything that may drive the heat of the wire up, like confined spaces or other hot wires in the bundles.  Heat will lower the current carrying capacity of the wire.  For a case of plenty of air flow, and small bundles.  The 4/0 cable should be ok."

I've met a couple BME's  who tried something similar, and they didn't understand simple things like FETs and it made understanding other concepts difficult at times.

Make sure to check with each school about specific requirements before you pick one, one school I looked at required three specific undergraduate classes for all incoming MEs, another required more coursework than that, and for the I ended up attending I had to meet with the grad program director, go over my undergraduate transcript with him, and determine what classes I had to take accordingly."

Obviously the particular component values are hit-or-miss but you get a good range of parts and component values.  The prices are cheap enough you can ""make it up in volume"".    From Jameco:  http://www.jameco.com/1/1/10-gb191lb-grab-bag-hundreds-of-miscellaneous-components.html  They even suggest getting the drawer cabinet to sort them.  :-)  One pound of components.  You can assembly a variety of parts from Digikey et al. if you are willing to kick the quantities up a bit to get volume discounts.   We typically load up on SMTs buying them by the reel which puts the price for hundreds to thousands at ~$10-$20.  If you need something for a project you do this and then try to re-use them (even build odd parts out of ones you have)."

So, technically he had a backelor's degree, but not in engineering and not a bachelor or science.  Keep in mind, though, that he did this in the early 80s, when you could still become and engineer via an apprenticeship rather than getting a degree. Now, if a lab tech wanted to get into design and showed an aptitude for it, they would be told to get their degree and probably be financially backed. But they wouldn't be put in a design role without a degree. The only place I can see something like happening these days is with software development."

ECE,3apuet,GotPins,10,Tue Jun 23 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"Well, when I graduated undergrad all I could get interviews with were for larger corporations where I was a cog assigned to a pretty narrow, boring project. This was echoed by some offers I got as a grad (they were hopeful I'd take the boatloads of money and not see the pig under the lipstick), like one where my job was to take years of control systems programs and put it in another language. Or some guys in their 40's I saw as a grad intern whose entire purpose it was to sit and make small changes to circuits in their cubicles to make it cost cheaper, and other middling work.  But with my MS I got access to interviews and offers from fun jobs, best described by my current job, which requires a MS, as do most like it. I am an engineering scientist, doing R&D work in oceanographic systems. I am in the final stages of a radical redesign of a deep ocean system, designing the full electronics system, all of the board level designs, as well as the firmware for it. And the system is brand spanking new, so there were some really challenging things to solve, in both hardware and software. Further, I get to go to sea quite often to test my hardware, and am going out soon to deploy this brand spanking new system I got to design. That is my idea of a fun job, which is not accessible to someone without a MS."

I am simultaneously overqualified for many jobs in my area (lots of entry level work) and also lacking experience (for senior-positions).

You can make such a comparison, but it's not that simple.  If an employer wants an FPGA designer, having an MSEE doesn't take the place of two years of actual FPGA design.  On the other hand, two years in an engineering firm doesn't give someone the knowledge you get from two or three years of school.  It's complicated, and can't by summarized in a sentence."

Advanced degrees may absolutely close some doors. But they will likely open up just as many or more doors as well. It comes down to your own personal taste in a job. If research/academia is your thing, advanced degrees are practically a requirement.   If you like what you are currently doing, but are just trying to get more money, your best bet is probably going to be to just start taking on new tasks at your job and learning new skills on the side, then start trying to negotiate for more money, either where you are or at a new position on a similar team."

The day I graduate is the day I get promoted outside of the usual expirience career route. Basically it will tack on 2 years of expirience to my record.  Why do I actually work on my MSEE? I think that in general BS degree is a ""taster"" degree. You take bunch of classes. You like some, you don't like others, but in all reality you don't end up learning too much about the ones you like. There are so many good advanced topics in every field. Plus the money.... As a final motivator...  In general here in States MS degree separates you, makes you more desirable to employers. And once you are hired you are assigned more interesting work. Will it close doors? Yes. But it will open more. However you will not be hired just for your degree. Pick your specialty wisely.   And really you don't have to trust me on this.

In my opinion, it doesn't really make sense to leave a full time job for a research based masters degree unless you are planning to do a PhD. Two years isn't enough time to develop enough research experience to be an independent researcher and the depth of the thesis will not be very deep. If the option is available, you should look into a coursework masters that you can complete while working because it just doesn't make sense in my mind to do a research thesis if you aren't planning on moving into a PhD. However, it's paid for and that is very rare for masters students so that might change things a little.

I talked to schools about their course based programs - not them nor the graduates are happy with those programs. Essentially, people who have failed to find jobs just enrol in the program so that they can earn a master's degree in just one year, but they rarely provide significant research/project once they're done.  I am not interested in academia, so PhD is not on the horizon for me. My degree is from outside US/Canada, and not really well-known (although accredited) so I think it'd be nice to upgrade it this way."

On the other hand, I'm not sure I'll ever use what I'm learning in my MS program in practical work. My concentration is systems engineering. I'm currently a DevOps engineer career-wise. So, the verdict's still out on whether the degree will help me directly with my title. However, all in all, I don't regret pursuing my MS. I'd say it's up to you.

ECE,3aof5g,rainingdx,8,Mon Jun 22 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"Q = CV.  So dV/dt = I/C.  If your LCD screen uses 20 mA, the voltage will drop by 2000 volts per second with a 10uF cap.  In other words, if the lower operating voltage of the LCD is 1.5V and the battery voltage is 3V, it would operate for 750 microseconds from the capacitor alone.  10uF is a really tiny amount of capacitance, so that's not much of a surprise.  It's really only useful as AC decoupling, not bulk energy storage.  On the other hand, I have no idea where you got that a CR2032 can only supply 3 mA.  The battery can supply at least 10x that amount when it's fresh.  The trade-off is that you get significantly less capacity from the battery.  Here's an app note: http://www.ti.com/lit/wp/swra349/swra349.pdf"
ECE,3aof5g,psycoee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reference. I guess trusting wikipedia was not good this time for the 3mA number. Okay so now I know 30mA is the upper limit I feel a lot better about my setup, now I need to find out how dim 300mV does to the LCD."
ECE,3aof5g,1wiseguy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:21:56 2015 UTC,"The data sheet for A CR2032 is vague about the maximum current, and certainly doesn't indicate that it can source 10 mA or more.  However, you can find unofficial data on the web showing high-current operation. I looked into this when I was designing a Bluetooth device that needs about 15 mA in short bursts, and I decided that a CR2032 will be seriously overloaded at those currents.   It will work for a while, but eventually the internal resistance gets to the point where it can't maintain adequate voltage during current peaks, and it's done. You essentially have to downgrade the capacity by a factor of 2-3.  But people still use them in such applications. That's what powers a Sensor Tag, a BLE demo unit from TI."
ECE,3aof5g,psycoee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"A data sheet simply provides some specifications that the manufacturer either guarantees or at least has measured.  It's not a source of absolute truth, and you shouldn't base your design only on what's in the data sheet.  It's quite common to buy components and characterize them yourself to determine their actual performance.  Large companies who care about reliability do this whenever they switch to a new vendor for a part, even if it's something common like a CR2032 battery.  There are often huge variations in performance between suppliers even for nominally identical parts.  In the link I posted in my previous comment, you can see some characterization data for several different CR2032s.  You can see that the internal resistance is below 10 ohms for about 50% of its service life.  So that means you could potentially go as high as 50 mA if you are OK with taking the capacity hit.  I've seen many keychain flashlights powered by CR2032s, and that's about how much they draw.  I suppose you aren't getting the full capacity, but for a battery that costs 25 cents even in single-unit quantities, it probably doesn't matter a whole lot.  Engineering is all about tradeoffs."
ECE,3aof5g,1wiseguy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"One of the problems, as you mention, is that some brands of coin cells are better than others. So if you manufacture a device that works fine with a Panasonic CR2032, and then your customer replaces it will some Chinese battery from ebay, then it's going to suck, and he's going to think your product sucks.  You can sternly warn the user to only use certain brands of batteries, but some of them toss the user's manual along with the packing material."
ECE,3aof5g,gargeug,2,Mon Jun 22 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"An important calculation that will answer both 1 and 3 is first you need to find the lower operating limit of the LCD screen. Look in the data sheet for that. Then you find the operating current at a certain voltage and get its equivalent resistance. Then, to answer 1, just find the RC discharge time of the bulk capacitor you select, and the resistance of your load. FYI, you should size the bulk capacitor such that the voltage decrease on the cap is still above the lower operating limit of your LCD screen by the time you want it to shut off.   Yes, there will be voltage droop from the capacitor. The datasheet spec you are looking for is R_esr (equivalent series resistance). Look it up on google to see it is like having a series resistance on top of your capacitor. This is what will set the droop, and also what will limit how much current can flow through the capacitor (ie, the voltage droop is too much because the load is demanding too much current, or the current overheats the capacitor and it blows up, although this is really only an issue in switched mode supplies)  EDIT: if you choose an electrolytic they will have high ESR. The really low ones will be ceramic, or polymer tantalum. But FYI, polymer tantalums like to eat their own parasitic current as well, which may not be suitable for a handheld battery device. Ceramic is your best bet."
ECE,3aof5g,Runenmeister,2,Mon Jun 22 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"Should be in the datasheets. Current draw from a charged cap will vary with a plethora of factors, including voltage and temperature, but the most relevant ones should have a characteristic graph in the datasheet of whatever cap you are thinking to use.  Also, what you're considering doing is a well-known topic called decoupling. These decoupling capacitors (sometimes referred to in my industry as 'decap') smooth out power supply noise and switching noise by giving a low-impedance path to transient currents (I.E. noise), and provide instantaneous current to local devices.  For that last thing - due to the inherent inductance of wires and other components, current can't be supplied instantaneously to a power supply's load from the power supply, which can limit the device's performance if it's switching particularly fast (like an LCD's controller). Decap is added as NEAR as possible to the power/gnd pins of these devices. When I say ""near,"" I don't just mean electrically (as in directly in parallel with the power/gnd pins), I mean physically as well - as physically close as is possible to the power/gnd pins. This reduces the amount of stray inductance between the decap and the device the decap is supplying instantaneous current to. Within reason, it's not really possible to have ""too much decap.""  As far as question 3 goes, it might work, just expect it being a little dim as a result. But I would try to get as close to 3.3V as possible. As long as you see something, you aren't going to harm it by being a little below. The LCD's datasheet should tell you that 3.3V is the nominal, but it has a tolerance range (and in fact, one way to dim an LCD is lower the power supply rail voltage below nominal but above the minimum).  Most devices will specify in the datasheets a required minimum amount of decap to function as-advertised, if needed at all.  A ""bulk capacitor"" is analogous to decap for the power supply, but is typically way larger than normal decap values."

ECE,3aequ7,capnwally,13,Fri Jun 19 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its a matter of preference. I chose to study ECE because I was interested in the material, but not because I wanted to be an ECE as a career. I worked at one of the largest asset management firm as an intern on the tech side, and I considered trying to move over to the finance side for a full time position.   From my experience as an intern (and talking wiht the other interns) it's fairly straightforward. So long as you've taken some basic Econ and Finance courses, you'll pass the initial hurdle. A lot of what my fellow interns were doing on the finance side was PowerPoint prep/ data entry. Especially as an intern, the theory of what is taught in schools doesn't do much versus the practical skills needed.   Generally the first 2 years in finance are spent learning the skills to be promoted. The companies are looking for people with a basic understanding/interest in finance and people who are able to learn fast/work hard. ECEs with some finance background tend to fit those criteria.   One thing to note about the finance industry: If you've passed the CFA, you can skip ahead two years. You're shooting yourself in the foot if you decide to go to finance straight out of undergrad, because you could have made that transition after going to business school or if you just passed the CFA on your own.   One last note, if you are thinking about finance: I found the culture of the finance industry to not suit me. I actually think the company I worked for was better than most, but even they had some... odd quirks. Guys had to be clean shaven, guys could not wear khakis, interns had to stay later than their bosses, reporting overtime was discouraged...   There were a lot of other smaller issues I had, but I won't go into that. Overall, I decided I wanted something where people were passionate about what they were doing because they believed it was  worth it. Your bachelors in ECE carries you further than you'd think. If you aren't looking to do straight engineering (and ignoring finance), you also could aim for a consulting gig or working in software."

ECE,3aequ7,capnwally,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:34:29 2015 UTC,"In my division it seemed like there is a very standard path for the first two years. This was similar to the finance side, in that almost everyone was promoted by the end of the two years from associate to analyst. But if you wanted to do really well you needed to go above and beyond and really network. Especially if you wanted to transfer you'd need to network and meet managing directors or vps in other divisions. They had a few days of training they hammered into is at te beginning of the summer. Number one takeaway is that you should be hyperaware of your personal brand. Always do outstanding work and know who the right people to talk to are. In that sense, getting promoted is probably the same as any other company. There is always somewhat of a political element to promotions, which is probably true even in engineering companies. The finance world was just very upfront about it."

For example, FPGAs when you need precise timing on some networking stuff (think high frequency trading.) They can do this at networking companies, for example, but they might do it at companies specifically selling stuff to banks / etc.  Some do security stuff - if you're an EE, you can be well qualified to do everything from code audits to sniffing out bad traffic to detecting rogue devices to being a pentester."

ECE,3aggjv,Tanky321,8,Fri Jun 19 23:14:23 2015 UTC,http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/  You are only allowed (by the spec) to draw 100mA until you negotiate a higher level of current draw from the host.  Sometimes you will get away with 500mA or even more but you're operating outside the standard.  There are also specs for dedicated USB charging ports (data lines shorted or known resistance value) that mean there is no host and a higher fixed current limit.
ECE,3aggjv,rand000m,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"So, specifically on the second point.  Is there a simple way to determine how much power I can draw as a load?   I assume this wouldn't work, but as an example? Could I watch the supply voltage with a comparator? If it drops below say 4V ,I know that the supply can't source that kind of current. Therfore I can programmatically setup my device to draw less current.   Hopefully this makes sense.  Thank you for taking the time to respond!"
ECE,3aggjv,rand000m,7,Sat Jun 20 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"There is a simple way, you follow the spec :)  Using a 4V comparator to find the point when current limit or overcurrent protection cuts in will give a result.  If overcurrent protection is poorly implemented on the motherboard/hub/power supply you risk damaging the port.  YMMV. That's why there is a spec, so you don't have to stress the port into overload to determine the limit of current draw. The protection level is a bit higher than what the port will happily provide so you shouldn't be pushing it right to that point. There needs to be a margin.  Practically speaking, you can usually get away with 500mA from a normal USB port.  Doing so is NOT compliant with the spec though (the spec is 100mA unless the computer grants permission for more). Charging ports are defined in the USB spec I linked to earlier and the spec defines how to detect them and how much current you can draw.  As an engineer my advice is to follow the spec. As a realist my advice is to make a judgement on how cheeky/risky you are willing to be to get power bearing in mind liability for damage to equipment.  It depends whether your device is for widespread commercial use or just your own entertainment. If you are only going to blow up your own computer then go nuts. If you are selling thousands then follow the spec to the letter."
ECE,3aggjv,AntiMe,4,Sat Jun 20 08:29:54 2015 UTC,"The computer is smarter than the port, it'll report an overcurrent condition (for modern systems anyway) and shut down that port.  I don't know what's built into the motherboard to detect this though."

ECE,3affoc,incognito1600,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"most household circuit breakers are rated up to 600VAC, and some have DC voltage ratings.   The purpose of the two poles is that they measure amp draw individually, and trip both contacts, thereby disrupting power flow on both poles. If the breaker is a panel mount, like the industrial control panel mains, you can wire the 120 line through the L1 input, loop a wire from T1 to L2, then from T2 to your device. Then just connect the grounded wire to the neutral terminal and the grounding wire to the frame.  Alternatively, and more importantly, just get the correct single pole breaker and install the correct devices and wiring."

Your job is to disappoint them the least.  The manufacturing aspects of it are as equally (if not more so) important as the theory. A former coworker of mine used a local magnetics house to build some 10kW power transformers and inductors, and he ended up telling the magnetics house how to do their job better. Something about using proper tensioning when winding the wire around the core; they had a tensioner but it wasn't working correctly, if I remember right."

I'd suggest building some circuits, maybe build an amplifier, and trying out some microcontroller programming before jumping in.  You might want to find out if you actually like engineering before committing.  Your first job will probably depend more on personal projects and internships than what school you go to.  Employers may focus more on whether you can produce than what school you went to or degree you have.  Some companies avoid PHDs because they're more expensive to hire, the company doesn't really need the expertise, and they've been in the education system too long.  Definitely go for it if that's what you want because it's hard to go back to school once you're out, just something to consider."

The list of pre-reqs is indeed daunting - 3 general physics courses, 2-3 math courses, 1 chem + lab, programming, and circuits courses (my electronics courses were not calc-based, so essentially negligible in terms of pre-reqs). I agree that I should get some more circuit experience on my own before diving in - I plan on getting one of the arduino starter kits and going through that. Do you have any rough suggestions on amplifier projects? Not specific projects per se, but if a beginner should start off with a power amplifier vs. microphone preamp vs. a headphone amplifier, etc."
ECE,3af9zi,Evidence_Of_Absence,3,Sun Jun 21 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading your post correctly, you are getting way ahead of yourself (nothing wrong with planning ahead though).  Calculus and a physics minor is not enough to be prepared for EE graduate school, even if that minor happened to be all the right courses (plenty of circuits, EM, and one solid-state course).  As far as a PhD is concerned, you have to pass the prelim to be considered a PhD student, and without a thorough EE  background, you will not pass.  If I had to hazard a guess, you're looking at at least 3 semesters just to catch up for undergrad, unless your physics minor was all the right courses and fairly rigorous, in which case you might get it done in 2 and manage to take a few relevant grad courses alongside that.  I knew one guy who did a full physics major undergrad and he still had to play catch up for 2 semesters after he started his M.S.E.E.  You might be better off taking an undergrad EE minor's worth of courses or a smattering of online courses (from a legit online program) before worrying about an M.S.  I'm also not sure why you think you wouldn't have a shot at getting admitted to a top state school for a second B.S.  I don't think it would be that hard with a solid GPA and some sort of activities/work experience/etc.  Probably not worth doing that anyway though unless all of your credits transfer and you only have to take ~30 hours or so for what would basically be a double major, but at a different school."

ECE,3abjw6,pseudosine,5,Thu Jun 18 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"First, coursework. You got that already? Great. Can you do more? There's usually not a huge amount of FPGA-related coursework in a standard curriculum, so no big deal if not.  Next, hobby projects / self-directed projects. Grab an FPGA board and software to compile/program your verilog and off you go. Make some cool shit. Make it do stuff.  While you're at it, if you have the chops / interest, why don't you design a small FPGA board? You can use smaller FPGAs (eg, from Lattice semiconductor) to keep cost down. Component cost to buy an altera or xilinx low-end fpga and all the surrounding circuitry, in onesies (as in, not in bulk) is probably around $30-40 per board including manufacturing.  Now, if you don't want to design an FPGA board or you want a cheaper alternative to play with, try buying a CPLD board or designing one yourself. It's, like, a fourth of the price and a tenth of the effort due to much more generous trace width requirements, power supply requirements, and so on. CPLDs are basically just gimped FPGAs that can't do as much. They are often used for glue logic. You can easily put down some hundreds of gates or some verilog code, it's just a bit less capable.  But having experience with this means you will almost certainly also learn how to build a little jtag interface for programming, maybe play with some peripherals... all you do is add a microcontroller and some communication between the two devices, and baby, you got a fully fledged embedded design going.  That brings me up to the third common point of learning: work. You're not necessarily being hired as an FPGA guy TM , but as an embedded guy who knows how to do FPGA stuff. Now let's say you still love FPGAs in a few years. So you do more on the FPGA side, pick up more and more skills.  Before you know it, you can be hired as an FPGA guy.  Another possible point of entry is through chip design. Chip designers use these massive banks of FPGAs to do emulation. Especially on smaller teams, you can get your fingers in a lot of pies: you learn emulation platforms in one place, you can get hired for many others. You'll be sorta-FPGA-guy if you do that.  Networking is similar. There are often requirements to use big beefy FPGAs for very fast (and precisely timed) network routing and analysis. If you are on a networking team and you get your fingers in the FPGA pies, well, you can be an FPGA guy after some experience there."
ECE,3abjw6,gimpwiz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  This is great information and exactly what I was looking for.  Additionally, I'm pretty interested in PCB design type stuff too.  I taught myself how to use KiCAD over last semester, and actually had my board made via oshpark.  Nothing fancy really, I basically just copied a generic atmega schematic from an arduino and then added some chips directly to it.  When you say design your own FPGA board, do you mean something similar to this, where I prototype it on a design board and then put the final design on my own board?"

You don't want a DC generator (which is what a dynamo is), because they are less efficient and the brushes wear out quickly.  Most car alternators are actually 3-phase AC generators with a set of diodes and a circuit that regulates the output voltage by adjusting the current going through the field coil (the actual part that rotates).  100hp=74.6kW, however as I understand it you normally have to have about twice as much engine power as you get from the generator, so you'd want around a 35-40kW generator head.  Also, if 100hp is the maximum power rating of your engine, you may want to derate it for the sizing calculations, since if it's something like a car engine, it's not meant to produce its maximum power output continuously."
ECE,3a7gc7,7uc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:26:02 2015 UTC,I don't think you want to rectify near max power. The torque spikes will be very large without a flywheel.

You can throw in phony excuses if you want, but if people find out that you are an engineer they start bringing you ""fun projects"" that they expect you to do, or broken stuff they want fixed for free.   On the topic of freelance and charging, it depends...  Hourly can cause problems because the customer often doesn't understand how many hours a thing takes to do, and normally you are working where they don't see you. This can and often does end up with bad feelings and accusations of charging for hours not worked. Also, the IRS looks at hourly with suspicion sometimes, because they want to know if you are employed by this person, or acting as an independent contractor. Hourly starts to look like employment.  Flat Rate Quote is normally the best way to go. The pitfall to watch out for here is when you underquote or end up never being able to fulfill the contract and get paid. The up side is that the customer feels secure in knowing how much something will cost, and you don't get into squabbles over the hourly thing.   To give an accurate flat rate quote you need to have the full design specs required by the customer and the maximum time period they allow to get it done. You need to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and estimate the hours and material costs to get to that endpoint. So once you hammer out the requirements with the customer, tell them ""Give me three days to do some estimating, and I'll get back with you on this quote."" Don't try to pop a number out of your head, you will regret that. At the end of 3 days, you might call them back and tell them you can't take the contract, and something has popped up, sorry. It might be because after thinking it over, you don't trust them, or the project seems too foggy to see the end of the tunnel. Don't tell them that, just bow out.  If it is a small business, then ask for some references of people they have done contract work with before. They will likely make the same request of you. Normally there is a small payment to get the project going, which the contractor considers an ""earnest payment"". Don't use that term with the customer! It means you are testing them to see if they are really earnest about doing business, or just playing around. If they balk at paying an earnest fee, you can assume you will never receive the final full payment anyway. To the customer you call this a ""start up cost"".  Get the requirements and payment agreement on paper, signed by somebody who has financial power in the organization. Watch out for vague wording like ""to the customer's satisfaction"". Sometimes a project criteria is met, but the customer might declare to be dissatisfied, so they have a reason not to pay.  If the customer seems the slightest bit dishonest or nuts, back out before signing any contract with them.  Most all contracts that I've done worked out well. I had one company try to rip me off, but I got them to cough up payment without having to go to court. Some companies will either defer payment for months or will just keep stringing you along long after the contract is completed, hoping you will write it off as a bad debt. Withholding a critical piece of the design until full payment is received is often a good incentive for the customer to come up with final payment.   If you have trouble tellng people ""NO"", you might also have trouble negotiating and collecting on contracts. You have to be firm with them sometimes. But... I found most of my customers were very good with payment and happy with the results. Once you know a customer and they come back for more, you can drop all the formal crap and often deal with them easier because you know they are on the up-and-up.  But you will meet a lot of nuts and con men."

Honestly though, I'd say you probably have a 10-20% chance (based on what I've seen with myself and my friends).   If you want to increase your odds, visit the school and ask to meet with different professors in your goal specialty and program coordinators. Come prepared. Be able to tell your story (what you want to do professionally and why their program is the best thing out there for you. Also, bring some good questions. One of the easiest ways to get into a grad school is to get a professor to say ""I want this kid."" Maybe even establish a correspondence ahead of time saying you're interested in their work, have read their papers, and would love to come research with them (despite just going for a masters).  The one thing I ended up doing was straight out asking the one program coordinator ""What are my chances of getting into this program?"" I worded it a little more gently, like ""I know you don't have all of the information, but from what you know about me, do you think I have a good shot of being admitted here? I won't hold you to whatever you say. I would just like to focus my energy elsewhere if I don't even have a chance."" The lady told me I would likely be admitted with a scholarship when I asked that, so I think it's worth a shot.  I've gone through two different grad school application processes (law school and ECE M.Eng.) so if you want to know anything else feel free to PM me."

You have an even better shot if you're a US citizen---EE/ECE grad students that are US citizens are in pretty high demand right now, and furthermore for a masters you're typically paying the university and not vice-versa, and they love that. You've gone to a good school, have a great GPA, and it sounds like your extra-curriculars are in order as well.  Source: I went to Penn and finished with a 3.77 or so, had a few publications and worked in 2 research labs while there. I only really had 1 good internship to speak of, but I got into Stanford's MS program. Ended up going somewhere else for a PhD instead though.

ECE,3a4pe4,exoptatus,3,Wed Jun 17 05:16:43 2015 UTC,"I think they're generally seen as slightly less impressive than in-classroom masters. A purely online masters won't have things like lab time, which can be an issue for hands on experience. Depending on your field, that can be less of an issue (more theory or software-focus = less need for hands-on). I poked around looking at online masters not too long ago and remember seeing some hybrid programs where lectures were online and then there'd be something like a week you'd go out to the university and do all the labs, or labs would be on the weekend, etc.  That said, the reputation of the university is a big driver.  ITT and U Of Phoenix are obviously a joke, but Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, state schools, etc are all reputable.  At the very least make sure they're ABET certified.   Disclaimer: not a hiring manager/recruiter/etc, just giving my limited experience  Edit: whoops, just saw that you listed John's Hopkins and the like. Yes, if you can get into those, by all means. My experience is for the most part people don't care where you went as long as you know what you're doing and it's not ITT tech, but high end schools like those do give you a bump. The downside is since you won't be physically attending, you won't get the sweet networking opportunities."

ECE,3a4051,kingcoyote,2,Wed Jun 17 01:30:14 2015 UTC,2 things. Did you also do f_close when you finished?  Did you use a hex editor like HxD to look at what is on the SD?  It has the ability to mount the card and see all bytes including the FAT32 setup bytes. You can reformat then write a file. Then use HxD to see the FAT and find where the first sector for the file is and see if any data is there.
ECE,3a4051,Turst,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!  I am not calling f_close in my loop. Based on the FatFs documentation for f_sync, I feel that calling f_sync is sufficient. The function is called once per second, and has a series of f_write calls ending with an f_sync call. That f_sync call should flush the buffer to the card. I think the buffer is 512 bytes, and my function should only put about 80-120 bytes in the buffer at a time, so I should be well shy of that limit.  I have not tried HxD and that is an excellent idea. I've been using hexedit to view the binary file, but that only tells me what is in the file and doesn't give me information on the rest of the card. I'll have to check that out tomorrow."

ECE,3a4051,bradn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"It's not completely solved, but it's a lot closer.  The two main issues that I fixed were to change some lines in ff.c in regard to mem_cpy and to change how I'm passing the file name to f_open.  First in regard to mem_cpy... it looked like XC8 did weird things with some lines in ff.c. I  had to change  mem_cpy(rbuff, &fp->fs->win[fp->fptr % SS(fp->fs)], rcnt);   to  unsigned int x = &(fp->fs->win) + (fp->fptr % 512); mem_cpy(rbuff, x, rcnt);   XC8 was doing bizarre things with that first call and instead of passing in 0xD16, it was passing in 0x200D16, which is out of valid memory range. By splitting that call in two, the compiler stopped junking the data and I was able to write to the disk properly.  Second, I had been calling f_open as:  f_open(&file, ""test.txt"", FA_CREATE_NEW | FA_WRITE);   And I noticed that even when data was being written, it was never written to the correct file. Filenames were either junk or just ""."" I changed the line to  unsigned char filename[16]; sprintf(&filename, ""test.txt""); f_open(&file, &filename, FA_CREATE_NEW | FA_WRITE);   and suddenly it worked. I'm not sure what was happening. I use inline string literals like that elsewhere in the code (when interacting with an FT800 display driver) and it works great."
ECE,3a4051,bradn,2,Mon Jun 29 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"Try bisecting the functionality... for example, try doing a manual sector write (ideally not at the beginning sector, just to make sure it addresses properly) and see if that works.  If it works, you know to look toward the higher level, if not, look at the lower level functions."
ECE,3a4051,bradn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"That is a good idea and I might try it out. Based on what I've seen, I feel it is very likely a higher level issue, somehow related to FatFs. Whenever I see data on the SPI line, it always looks great. The issue is that FatFs is not transmitting when I call f_sync like I expect it to.  Some of my thoughts on why that is are:   FatFs thinks the file has already been synced and does not need to flush the buffer. FatFs thinks the SPI line is unavailable and refuses to write until it becomes available. FatFs is confused about the details of the FAT partition and is unable to decide where to put the sector, and refuses to write. FatFs has some confusion about the location of the file, relative to the root, and is unable to write.   I don't feel the problem is in FatFs itself, however. I think my SPI communication or the way I open the files or mount the disk are at fault. I just can't nail down exactly what it is that I'm doing to displease FatFs."

I'd like to be able to take a given cable, take measurements at the lower level and say exactly where it falls on the spectrum from good to bad, so we can get to the best cable with durability.

If there are no difficult routing requirements keep your traces fat (10+ mil). This ensures manufacturability. Also small traces can hardly carry any current.

It's not uncommon to get positions for power management IC design in big companies like Apple or Intel, and even in smaller startups (not too sure how well this translates to the European job market though).  Getting into IC-level power electronics design from a the very high-voltage regime will take a lot of effort on your part, but I think it's the most rewarding of your three options. I hope you do well, whatever you choose!"
ECE,3a0guw,pavante,5,Tue Jun 16 08:14:34 2015 UTC,Contact some of the graduate students in the department and ask them about their research.
ECE,3a0guw,jag213,3,Tue Jun 16 12:58:29 2015 UTC,"I'd be thoughtful about your interest here. Did you enjoy power electronics in your U.G.? How about power systems? Both are very different in terms of the day-to-day work, toolset, etc. As a part of my PhD course work, I took grad level courses in all three areas and of course they are all very different. For myself, I am not into circuit stuff and that is just fine. I enjoyed power systems much more. You may be different. The key is that both options will take you down a different path in your career, and you may want to consider letting your interests decide what path that is. Career opportunities abound in both spaces, and you'll have an opportunity in your MSEE to take courses in power systems and power electronics within your first year to get a gauge of where you want to head for your second year."
ECE,3a0guw,northernmike,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"In my undergrad, I took various power systems courses including electric machinery, power system analysis, renewable energy. I took one power electronics class, and it was certainly more exciting and challenging than power systems. I have worked on the consulting side. I think that the experience will be different on the manufacturing side for working in companies, such as SEL, Siemens, ABB, GE, or national labs. What area of power systems is your research in?"
ECE,3a0guw,ATXBeermaker,2,Wed Jun 17 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"For plan A would your goal be to do IC design or something more like applications work? If your goal is to be an IC designer, you might have a specific field in mind (e.g., power electronics) but realize that you might end up getting a job offer for something else entirely. Or, you might get a job at a company doing power management now, but then their roadmap changes in a few years and no longer includes power products. So, if you choose IC design, be sure that's what you'd like to do, because it's a not a cakewalk.  That said, power management IC design jobs are incredibly lucrative these days. That's what I do and I get unsolicited calls several times per week from recruiters gauging my interest in a new position. Both large established companies and small startups are looking to hire people with power management IC expertise and not a lot of people have it."

Further, there are many branches which you can specialize in, like motor drives, converters for renewable energy or switching power sources.  If you need more information feel free to ask."

There are many, many U.S. jobs in engineering, from plant design (DNV-GL is hiring, as are many many many others), to inverter power electronics (sun power, etc.)"

ECE,3a1jte,merton1111,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"Or you could do what normal people do, and debounce in software.   Doesn't that mean triggering and handling an interrupt for every bounce, maybe both when contact is made and broken?"
ECE,3a1jte,Bromskloss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"No.  It's as simple as reading the value at time t0, and checking it again at time t1 (t1-t0 > debounce time as measured by an oscilloscope).  If they are the same value, your debounce is done, otherwise continue the process.  No interrupts needed.  You can poll the pin at regular intervals, or you could start the process with an interrupt caused by the first bounce."
ECE,3a1jte,declension,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"or you could start the process with an interrupt caused by the first bounce.    Yeah, OK, that method I would be fine with. Polling is not so nice, in my opinion.  Actually, perhaps one should trigger at the first contact, and then simply set a dead time, during which no further interrupt from that button will be generated. All this of course assumes that each button is connected to an interrupt pin of its own, so that not all buttons are locked out (unless this is acceptable)."
ECE,3a1jte,Bromskloss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Polling is not so nice, in my opinion.   Why not? Regular sampling of switches/pots/whatever is very common."
ECE,3a1jte,HeroOfCanton,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"Well, with polling, the effort spent by the processor scales with the number of buttons and other things to poll, rather than with how much they are actually used. The whole point of interrupts is to offload all that work from the processor, isn't it?"
ECE,3a1jte,Bromskloss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, timer ISR fires when it's time to sample. You sample all of the things that need to be sampled. If your part supports DMA, you could use that and free up the processor even further."
ECE,3a1jte,HeroOfCanton,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:45 2015 UTC,"I prefer polling.  It makes the code much easier to read not having some of it done in the ISR and some of it done elsewhere (and oh my god don't you dare do all of it in the ISR).  Also makes the code snippet portable (easier anyways) to other uC's.  On top of that, the debounce time is so short that, as a user pressing a button, you will never know if it is done with an ISR or it is delayed by approx. 1-2 debounce times."
ECE,3a1jte,declension,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"(t1-t0 > debounce time as measured by an oscilloscope)   Important consideration, because if t1-t0 < debounce time, you may just catch two lows/highs during a bounce period and get a false reading. The debounce time is sometimes specified in sw datasheet as well, but good idea to verify with o-scope, as you mentioned."
ECE,3a1jte,HeroOfCanton,5,Tue Jun 16 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"Don't expect to see this in production-level consumer electronics.  Every piece of HW costs money, and the debouncing RC circuit is a non-essential circuit ripe for the ax.  Debouncing in FW/SW will happen at the same speed and costs no money; there is really no upside I can think of to using a HW debounce."
ECE,3a1jte,declension,3,Tue Jun 16 16:28:42 2015 UTC,"there is really no upside I can think of to using a HW debounce.   EMI filtering. Can't do that in software.  I agree for high-volume consumer-level stuff the software approach is probably better, but don't treat it as an absolute rule. There are a lot of times that a simple RC filter, even though it costs a whole 0.25 cents extra (10K 0402 0.08cents, 0.1uF 0402 0.17 cents... yeah, I know, there's assembly costs too ), is better than the risk/NRE needed to do something in software correctly to avoid the hardware costs. Switch debouncing usually has minimal risk and I'd do it in software (aside from the EMI issue in some cases), but other cases, hardware is better."
ECE,3a1jte,jms_nh,2,Tue Jun 16 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"p.s. if you think you have arguments over component costs, try working in the semiconductor industry. We sometimes have heated discussions about adding individual features that add die area costs of 0.1 cent or less."
ECE,3a1jte,jms_nh,2,Tue Jun 16 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"""Debouncing your IoT buttons"" is a more accurate title. Also, the obligatory ""who does hardware debouncing outside of circuits 101 lab""."
ECE,39xgx1,CrumbleBread,17,Mon Jun 15 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a CompE who mostly does software engineering now (started CompSci and changed because I'd been programming since I was 12 and was bored). I know a lot of EEs turned programmers, and... well, finding out someone has that background tends to make me a bit wary of their code until I've had a chance to get to know them. Generally very smart people, and they can make things work, but structure and code quality tends to go out the door, which can cause serious long term problems with major software products.  So if you don't want to be that EE turned Programmer? Sounds like you've got the basics. Do realize that microcontroller C is typically quite a bit different from general computer production code - outside of narrow circumstances, you're not nearly as resource constrained, so the emphasis becomes programmer optimization rather than program optimization - you want clean and easily maintainable code, even if it takes a bit more run time and memory.  Khan Academy and Udacity both have courses you can use to gain knowledge on foundational topics like algorithms/data structures. Note that if you're wanting to get into the more practical software side, you don't need that in depth a knowledge of these - you need to know how to use them, and what the ramifications of the various structures are (Big O notation, lets you extrapolate performance characteristics), but not how to implement them. There are standard libraries that already implement them, and doing them again yourself is wasted work.   Foundations established, you'll want to look into software engineering - the craft of building robust and maintainable software, rather than just getting code working. It's admittedly a bit harder to define than some of the previous stuff. A good starting point is the book Head First Design Patterns - Design Patterns are a kind of software schematic, a general way of solving things that you can apply to many problems; it's nowhere near exhaustive, but it's a good primer to get you into the right way of thinking. You'll want to understand version control systems like git, Mercurial, and SVN (start with git, it's currently the most popular).  There's some good stuff at http://www.sw-engineering-candies.com/blog-1/top10thingseverysoftwareengineershouldknow for the engineering side."

ECE,39xgx1,Archs,10,Mon Jun 15 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  I already knew programming going into college so I chose EE to broaden my knowledge.  When I was a senior looking for jobs I realized that the software industry was my only option.  I was a good programmer and had a lot of projects under my belt, but the interviews were so algorithm and theory heavy it was crazy.  They expected you to not only know the language you were interviewing for by heart, but to know big-O notation, sort algorithms, trees, shortest path, complex threading issues, database optimization, etc."

ECE,39xgx1,cyrusm,3,Mon Jun 15 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"First off, do some research on precisely what type of position you would be most comfortable working in. Like electrical engineering, computer programming is multi-faceted.  There are a lot of sub-jobs in the field (like testing for example, or software engineering vs. software development, front-end vs. back-end development.  There are a lot of levels of abstraction as well).  Then you need to round out the skills required for that position.  Buy some books, do some on-line research, try out some personal projects.  Being involved in an open-source project can help with this significantly.  You need a demonstrable skill set that shows you can do the job, or are at the very least capable of learning how to do the job."
ECE,39xgx1,jhansonxi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"What do you recommend I should read? I'm still soul-searching, so I apologize if I'm too vague.

ECE,39xgx1,ivorjawa,2,Tue Jun 16 04:10:11 2015 UTC,"I personally can't suggest any specific books because honestly, there are hundreds if not thousands of books on all of the topics involved. O'Reilly manuals are generally my go-to when learning a new software skill.   If you want to help out with an open-source project, first thing I would do is find one that you both USE, and LOVE to use.  Get yourself on the project's mailing list so that you are in contact with the lead developers on the project, check out the project's bug-tracker, checkout the code and try to fix some bugs.  Hack around with it, try to create new features, break stuff and fix stuff, familiarize yourself with the project. Have fun with it.     It's a great experience, and not only looks good on a resume, but will also provide you with something to talk about in interviews when it gets to that point.   Plus side, it's a fantastic way to get practical experience. Downside is you're volunteering your free time (which I don't know about you, but my free time is pretty damned precious to me)   Try not to bite off more than you can chew as well.  I've known a lot of people jump into open source software by trying to create a new project, or trying to create yet-another-linux-distro.  It's best to ease your way into an established project and work your way up from there in my opinion."
ECE,39xgx1,GameTheorist,2,Mon Jun 15 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the obvious knowledge like languages and algorithms, there is much industry-specific knowledge to learn.  Big things are standards, security, and safety.  Some you can learn on the job but some you will be expected to know beforehand and it will vary by industry.    I'm a PCB designer in the auto industry and while I can't provide specifics regarding software development, I hear much from the engineers I work with.  System redundancy, fail-over, compatibility with components from other OEMs, liability, prototype and production testing, protecting trade secrets, and security are all common concerns for both software and hardware.    You'll probably have an easier time moving into a near-to embedded development, vehicle infotainment systems for example, instead of something completely different like office database development. You're more likely to already have some knowledge that overlaps with your embedded experience and will have an easier time working with embedded developers, perhaps in a liaison position."

The answer is about control: Who controls what runs on your computer? - only the free software ecosystem offers you real political control over your machine, and real transparency about how it works from top to bottom.  Having that transparency is the true enabler for a developer to gain true understanding - which is something you'll never find with closed source proprietary software e.g. Visual Studio; you'll always be a second class citizen, because you just have to take what the cooperation gives you as a black box.  This is my advice as someone who started programming C++ on Windows 3.1 at age 11, and programmed Microsoft C++ technology up until Windows Vista.

This could just be down to my current role, but I haven't have to worry about any data structures much more complicated than a linked list.  Kernel primitives and API calls would be worth a look into though. So having a go at medium C program (or Python) which uses threads and mutexes or semaphores might be useful, and if you are into networking maybe some sockets?   A lot of the time you won't be writing your own software from scratch, so becoming more familiar with trawling through APIs and manpages is all good experience. Again, depending on what type of MCUs you play about with you could try using a RTOS like ChibiOS to learn some of the basics of communicating with a kernel and getting an insight into larger software projects."

We have some hardware guys doing board layouts and FPGA programming, then we got some application software guys presenting the information to the user. I connect them - stich it together.

V = IR, boom, you're done.  But if the DUT is not electrically isolated from the rest of the world, two things can happen (one definitely, one maybe). First, the current applied by the DMM can go... elsewhere. Thus not through the DUT, as the DMM assumes. Second, if the circuit the DUT is embedded in is active, the circuit can be adding current of its own to the DMM's current through the DUT. Both of these result in the DMM being unable to make an accurate measurement of the DUT's resistance - all because the DMM thinks it knows ""I"" in V = IR, but it doesn't.  Edit: I didn't draw your circuit to figure out exactly what's going on - if you draw a basic schematic I'd be happy to help some more. But you're going to have a rough time debugging anything if you're trying to measure resistance of a device embedded in a dynamic circuit."
ECE,39zt87,dietlein,2,Tue Jun 16 14:06:53 2015 UTC,What others said. You can't measure resistance in the circuit the way you are doing it. You need to instead look at the voltage change at that node caused by the sensor.
ECE,39zt87,thepainteddoor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight, you are measuring ohms of the sensor while the car is running, and you are measuring with one lead of the ohmmeter on the car chassis or sheet metal, NOT the resistor? I think you're on the right track there. When you turn on an electrical load in the car, the electricity flows through the car chassis too, since that is used as a ground. This could create a voltage drop in the ground path you are using. I suggest you try two things:  1. measure directly at the thermal sensor and see how your reading differs 2. measure in the same place you were measuring before, and try swapping the meter leads. See if the resistance changes based on the polarity. You would be adding or subtracting the voltage drop of the ground path depending on which way the meter leads are attached, if this is the reason that your reading is changing."
ECE,39zt87,jzatarski,0,Tue Jun 16 07:44:44 2015 UTC,"you must be connected to +, however indirectly. the multimeter ground is floating with respect to your car; it doesn't care about the negative battery terminal unless it's forming a loop with +. try the other functions of your multimeter - see what the current through and voltage across the sensor is"
ECE,39v6at,fork_fork_fork,9,Mon Jun 15 01:46:29 2015 UTC,Is the FPGA what you had on hand? Or is this because it's still more prototype like?  Really my question is why a FPGA instead of just a basic microcontroller?
ECE,39v6at,cpmpal,7,Mon Jun 15 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"Hi, I specifically chose the FPGA for the console side. Not really for one big reason but for lots of little reasons.   I personally don't like bit banging, and I preferred to create a VHDL driver for the N64 protocol between the controller and the console.  The protocol uses a bidirectional asynchronous method. I probably could've handled this with a Micro as well but I liked the idea of integrating Tri state buffers in one of the pins to handle the bidirectional nature.  Eventually I want this one FPGA to handle all four controller simultaneously. Which would require 4 UARTs for the four RN42s. And 4 pins (1 pin for each controller) for the N64 protocol: again, maybe it'd be possible to bit bang the protocol for all four with a micro, but I didn't see it possible. So I'd have to have a single micro for each port, which is feasible sure, but I guess I romanticized about the idea of everything being handled through a single FPGA. I'm stronger with VHDL than embedded C. Not saying that I'm good at VHDL, but relatively speaking, I'm better at it than embedded C.   Thanks a lot for your question. Really I don't think that the FPGA is the ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to do it, just with my context I felt more comfortable using an FPGA."
ECE,39v6at,cpmpal,3,Mon Jun 15 11:19:12 2015 UTC,"Totally get being more comfortable with FPGA. I would say I'm the opposite but there are a lot of people on both sides. You do also raise a good point about needing to address all 4 controllers at the same time that extra hardware would not be trivial.  In my head I tend to think of microcontrollers as cheaper and smaller footprint than FPGA, and so I lean to them more. But the flexibility an FPGA can provide is very nice in comparison to a microcontroller. I hope it goes well, but it seems like you've got most of it done anyway"
ECE,39v6at,Konnerbraap,2,Mon Jun 15 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, newbie here. What are you referring to when you say bit banging?"
ECE,39v6at,gandalfblue,3,Mon Jun 15 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Bit banging is using SW to implement a protocol instead of HW. Microcontrollers that support certain protocols like UART, SPI etc have internal HW that supports those protocols. So that way in SW, you just write to the registers that support the protocol and the HW handles all the tedious stuff. But if you bit bang UART, your SW basically is tied up by going: ""ok now pin 4 go high, wait for 1 micro second, now go low, go high again"".   It's kind of like a baker with a stand mixer. The baker is the SW, and can only do one thing at a time. He wants to make bread, but he has to knead the dough. Instead of kneading it himself (bit banging), he puts it in the stand mixer and lets the mixer knead the bread while he goes and does something else. In this case, the kitchen supports a bread kneading protocol."
ECE,39v6at,hobbified,3,Mon Jun 15 17:38:26 2015 UTC,How much power does the controller port put out? I don't know about hour much power a Bluetooth module consumes but it might be enough to power a microcontroller.
ECE,39v6at,Fuckyourday,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"That's a really good question. I haven't thought about how much power the port is capable of providing.

Haven't really ironed those details out yet haha."

ECE,39v6at,MoserLabs,3,Mon Jun 15 16:55:26 2015 UTC,Was the interface/protocol between the N64 and controller released by Nintendo or did someone hack it? I think somewhere below you say it's UART.

ECE,39ouvq,sepehrhm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"Here is my 2 cents:  People who enjoy the theory aspect of EE, specially math, kind of diverge from engineering in their grad studies.  Lots and lots of my friends went to grad school in statistics, math, and economics. They're essentially scientists now, and they'll always be. If you choose to stay in EE though, communications and control systems are very math heavy if you pick your topic right. I'd say if you enjoy control systems, do not really worry about the job prospects, because with a master's or PhD in that field, you're going to apply for research positions. A lot of people at my school ended up doing data analytics, or finance, with a PhD in control systems.  So keep in mind that although your degree or department may say ""engineering"", you are training yourself as a researcher/scientist. Few engineering practices out there care about the advanced theory that is beyond undergrad, esp. in EE.  Keep in mind that not all areas of EE are like this. I know electronics are way more practical, and power doesn't really include that much math."

ECE,39opir,ReversedGif,2,Sat Jun 13 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"You can model a motor as a resistor, an inductor, and a voltage source all in series. The resistor corresponds to the winding resistance. The voltage source's voltage is ω/Kv (angular velocity/motor constant). The instantaneous current through the motor is proportional to the torque the motor is generating, with scale factor Kv (motor constant, again). Using this model, you can answer all your questions.  But here are some answers anyway:  You need a flyback diode. It does take time for the current to dissipate, during which it's effectively like the motor is shorted, which results in (to the first order) some of the inductor's energy dissipating through the resistor and the voltage source. Once steady state is reached, this corresponds to braking the motor.  However, contrary to your beliefs, switching it faster is actually better - twice the switching speed results in half as much torque ripple (as the current through the motor isn't dropping all the way down to what it is at the steady state while shorted). With a high enough switching speed, it's like you're not switching at all, but just supplying 6 volts.  A motor driven like this acts sort of like a buck regulator, so maybe read up on those to get some ideas."

Recognize the skills you're developing there and play them up - socialization, humor, building rapport quickly, charisma. I would say these things matter just as much to an employer as your skills! Remember they need to make sure they can stand to be around you for 40 hours a week, too!  Another - let's say you have a passion for woodworking. That's cool, too!

For example AWR microwave studio and Advanced Design System (ADS) can be used to simulate microwave structures and components at schematic level. With these you can draw your filter in schematic by connecting blocks simulating microstrip lines, coupled lines, vias, transistors and other elements. Simulation is very fast since it's based on models, but it might be inaccurate since not all effects are taken into account.  Sonnet, CST, Ansys HFSS and other 2.5D/3D electromagnetic simulators can be used to simulate arbitrary passive structures. They don't use any approximate models for the elements and the output is much more accurate including coupling between nearby structures and other parasitics but simulation takes much longer since they solve the Maxwell's equations."

A shift register does basic serial to parallel conversion, or vice versa. It requires a clock and for data to be stable when the clock transitions. It has no framing, to start detection, or error detection.  A UART may convert parallel to serial (or not) but it is also clockless, is asynchronous (the 'A' in UART) can transmit independently of the receiver, and is capable of detecting line errors.  A UART contains a shift register, but it is much more than just that. A shift register is incapable of the things a UART does beyond transferring bytes serially.  Claiming that they are different names for the same thing is incorrect."
ECE,39bbm4,rdfox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining what a UART is, but I already knew that.   Claiming that they are different names for the same thing is incorrect.   Nobody said that. They're just two examples of things that convert serial to parallel. Hence my dogs and cats example."
ECE,39bbm4,tonyarkles,-7,Mon Jun 15 05:29:24 2015 UTC,"This would be light work for arduino. In general a device called a serdes (serializer, deserialize) does this work. But I've only seen the term applied to high-speed, standards-based interfaces like PCIe. You might discover a dedicated device for SPI but there's no real standard so probably not. Any dirt-cheap MCU with enough GPIOs can be programmed for your particular needs."
ECE,39bbm4,pansartax,12,Wed Jun 10 18:56:34 2015 UTC,MCU is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overkill  you just nuked an anthill
ECE,39bbm4,tonyarkles,-2,Wed Jun 10 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're trying to optimize your BOM already? With arduino I will be up and running in a few minutes while you will still be looking for something that matches the width, polarity and other vagaries of your specific device.  If I need to go volume I will think a little more but usually there's an excuse for at-least 50-cents worth of MCU in any product."
ECE,39dtka,iwishyouwerentborn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Do you mean die stacking, in which two or more independently fabricated semiconductor chips are stacked above one another and connected with vias?

ECE,39bvqi,TheDrySponge,3,Wed Jun 10 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"You correlate what you're receiving with your expected signal, basically.  So, for example, if you have a PSK system, you can correlate your signal between the different phases (this is the 'educational' way of doing it, in practice it's done with FFT) to find out its phase"
ECE,39bvqi,raverbashing,2,Wed Jun 10 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Depending on what kind of noise you're trying to combat, a bunch of solutions exist. Others in this thread have talked about pass and filtering and correlates, which is fantastic for general Gaussian noise.   If you're looking for less random sources of distortion though, you can do some clever tricks. Line distortion, for example. If you know that the line has a particular transfer function, you can take the transfer function of the line and either pre-distort your signal on the transmitter end, or you can use correlators that look for the distorted version of the signal on the receive end."
ECE,39bvqi,tonyarkles,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"If you know the frequency range that your signal is supposed to be in, I'd say using a band pass filter would be what you'd want. However, I believe if you need to amplify a signal as well, you could adjust the gain of the amplifier such that it attenuates the frequency ranges that you don't want."
ECE,39bvqi,yoyoguy123,0,Sun Jun 14 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yes if you know stuff about your signal you could filter out some of the noise.   If you know you're signal is within a frequency band - you can let only this frequency band pass(band pass filter) , and thus lose the noise from rest of the frequencies.   BTW if you send data , even if the frequency of your sinusoid is fixed, if you modulate the phase/amplitude, that cause the spectrum  of the data to expand, and you need to keep that spectrum."

I'm currently using it as a memory expansion board for an old Commodore 64.  It uses a Picaxe 28x2 microcontroller for the serial interface and memory control, paired with 6116 SRAM for actual data storage."
ECE,398wcv,SlowCoach,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:08:32 2015 UTC,How do you connect it to the 64? Not through the expansion port?  P.S. Neat work.
ECE,398wcv,SlowCoach,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:18:35 2015 UTC,It's through the serial port. My original design was for the expansion port but the serial port ended up being much easier to use. Thanks!
ECE,398wcv,PlatinumX,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:01:25 2015 UTC,"Can you can share more details?   I guess on the board it is through UART or some serial protocol; and on the 64 you open the serial port using OPEN # (if using BASIC, which is a bit rusty on my side)"
ECE,398wcv,DuzzExor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"It is using the C64's serial protocol, which is loosely based off of the IEEE-488 bus.   On the C64 side I was limited to assembly as I needed complete control over the talk / listen commands. I didn't actually have an assembler expansion card (I wasn't able to find any on eBay at the time) so I got to poke and peek my commands into memory."
ECE,398wcv,DuzzExor,2,Wed Jun 10 04:38:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  This reminds me of one of my school projects.  For me, it really cemented a lot of skills are really core to computer engineering.  Making a whole computing system from scratch really helped my debugging and bringup skills.  Were they any parts that were particularly challenging?  Do you have any plans to do expand it at all, or make a follow on project?"
ECE,398wcv,PlatinumX,2,Wed Jun 10 10:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'm still a sophomore in high school, so I have a long way to go.   The most challenging part of this project was definitely getting it talking with the Commodore 64.  The C64 had some odd timing requirements that I didn't catch in the first few versions of my code.  I'm planning on putting a rechargeable coin cell backup on the board to stop the SRAM from losing its data whenever it gets disconnected.  I might also add a UART to my Z80 computer (it is still extremely basic) and get the board working with that.  In the long term, I'm planning to learn more about how to use FPGAs. They seem far more relevant in the modern world then 8 bit computer systems."

ECE,398wcv,MantaSquad,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:11:23 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to why you inserted the IC's into those black holders (I forgot what they are called). Why not just solder them directly to the board?
ECE,398wcv,matmann2001,2,Wed Jun 10 12:21:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience, this is done to allow you to easily swap chips in and out. It also serves the purpose of preventing any ESD through the IC during the soldering process. It can be pretty cheap insurance."
ECE,398wcv,MantaSquad,2,Wed Jun 10 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"JeffRobots describes it very well, but here is my reasoning. I ended up using quite a few CMOS chips that are quite ESD sensitive. When one of them blows, I don't want to have to desolder the whole chip and solder in a new one. The sockets make it really easy to swap out chips.  The sockets also mean I don't have to use the chips themselves in the construction process which also helps to prevent damage to the chips."

ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,23,Sat Jun 13 23:28:30 2015 UTC,"There's a huge market for controls right now. Even if your Gpa isn't stellar you shouldn't have any trouble finding a controls job in this market so long as you at least take a course related to PLCs in some way or another.   I graduated with 3 other guys and none of us had any controls related co-ops or internships and we all got jobs paying >= EE average in the controls field.   Good targets for these jobs are in the automotive industry and their suppliers. Toyota, Honda, etc are ALWAYS taking EE's from what I've heard."
ECE,3974j7,Jingle_,3,Tue Jun 9 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"If I can piggy back off this, I'm graduating soon and trying to decide on a specialty. Controls has always interested me because while I am an EE I always liked the programming aspect interfacing with the ""something actually does something"" aspect of motors etc. Plus I have quite a bit of experience with PLC's because I spent three internships in manufacturing enviornments. What are the big players outside of automotive? I ask because I would rather live somewhere outside of Ohio (no offense)."
ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,3,Tue Jun 9 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"None taken. I don't plan on sticking around much longer than a few years myself. Almost anyone that makes any sort of product in mass quantities has controls involved. Some examples of this are GE, IBM, NASA, Boeing, Goodrich, Procter & Gamble.. The list goes on. The market is by no means exclusive to Ohio either. That's just where I have first-hand familiarity.   You could also look at the supplier side of automotive because the companies that supply these companies with PLCs always have controls engineers involved on their end. Rockwell, Allen Bradley, Fanuc, Motoman, Keithley, Mitsubishi, etc. are all key players on that side of the fence."
ECE,3974j7,Jingle_,0,Tue Jun 9 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply. I don't have a stellar GPA either but I enjoy a lot of aspects of the EE field in general so I'm mainly looking for a decent paycheck and to move up into a supervisory position after a while. Which is why I've been looking at Power and Controls because I've heard there is demand in both fields, which hopefully means room to move up, since I'm more of a people guy than a numbers guy."
ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,2,Tue Jun 9 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in automotive, the progression to supervisor/projector planner type of role is somewhat stunted. If you hire in to program and run the line, they will value your experience and knowledge and try and keep you there as long as possible. There always has to be a boss of those people, but it isn't necessarily quite as easy as some other specializations (granted I've only worked in automotive, but everyone I've talked to seems to agree at least mildly with what i just said)"
ECE,3974j7,bla8291,2,Tue Jun 9 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"I just left a job doing control systems for drawbridges, and my current job has me doing controls for airport conveyors. It's in a lot more places than you would think."
ECE,3974j7,Jingle_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:43:19 2015 UTC,Are you employed by a company that gets contracted to do the work or employed by the airport. I like controls but I would prefer the former since I like variety and going new places once in a while. Plus my experience from manufacturing is if you are one of just a few controls guys there's no place to move up.
ECE,3974j7,bla8291,2,Wed Jun 10 15:17:37 2015 UTC,In both jobs we are contracted to do our work. Some companies have areas they want to focus on or have developed standard products that they lightly modify based on the customer.
ECE,3974j7,bakedpatata,3,Wed Jun 10 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"I second this. I recently got hired as an entry level EE at a company that does a lot of control systems and we are growing like crazy. Also, controls is a really broad field where you may be working with similar controllers but on completely different machines."
ECE,3974j7,Turst,3,Wed Jun 10 01:17:11 2015 UTC,What is EE average these days?
ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,2,Wed Jun 10 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"I think its between 55-65 for most places with normal costs of living.  Obviously if you go into SI valley/Seattle/etc. you are looking at more than this, but it averages out"
ECE,3974j7,N8_Doge,8,Wed Jun 10 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"You know I'm pretty sick of all of the people saying ""PLCs are child's play"". None of these people have any experience with designing a full blown integrated architecture for a large piece of machinery. Yes PLCs are simple if you are simply running conveyors and checking sensors. It gets much more complicated when you start developing motion control platforms and vision systems connecting to your SCADA system.   I do however agree that controls positions are hot right now. Automation is making it cheaper for companies to bring manufacturing back to the states. I've been in the controls field for 3 years since college and am now going on to my third job. I left my first job and found a new one within a month. Literally the entire time I've been at the new job I've been bombarded by recruiters on LinkedIn. I got interview offers from multiple companies and finally decided to go to one. Just accepted a new offer this week. I've increased my salary by 13% since leaving college over 3 years. I would say it's a decent field to be in right now.  Also, controls jobs let you get on your feet and out into the field and traveling a good bit if that's your cup of tea. I like being able to get away from my desk every now and then to go to a customer site and troubleshoot or commission some equipment."
ECE,3974j7,bla8291,2,Wed Jun 10 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the travel aspect of controls engineering is fun and exciting to me. Sometimes it involves long hours, but then again it's an opportunity to see machinery at work, an opportunity to see a new place, and an opportunity to get away from the office."
ECE,3974j7,zennoux,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"Do you have any resource recommendations for learning how to program PLCs? Textbooks, etc?"
ECE,3974j7,N8_Doge,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:43:01 2015 UTC,Unfortunately not really. I learned everything from hands on experience and reading through lots and lots of Rockwell literature.   You could google the basics and theory behind ladder logic and functional block diagrams which is really simple to learn. After that it's a matter of learning how each PLC manufacturer structures their development environment and their libraries of functions. Reading through Allen Bradley control logic manuals could be useful but you really need to understand the basics of ladder logic first.
ECE,3974j7,1wiseguy,4,Wed Jun 10 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think EE students study PLCs. You do that at a community college or EET program, as far as I know."
ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,-12,Tue Jun 9 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"Lol yes EE's study PLCs. Every big name university in the Midwest that im aware of has controls offered as a 3rd/4th year elective. Might be different elsewhere, but it's definitely not strictly for community colleges"
ECE,3974j7,1wiseguy,19,Tue Jun 9 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"I must have missed that. I have never actually seen a PLC in my life.  I think of PLCs as something that are used by hard hat wearing, time card punching factory workers."
ECE,3974j7,Xidus_,5,Tue Jun 9 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"They aren't that exciting, you aren't missing out. A lot of controls jobs are much more encompassing than just PLC programming. It turns into autocad design, wiring electrical cabinets.. Pretty much all of the planning done to put in new machinery or robots onto the floor is planned and designed by the controls engineer. So maybe that sells it a little bit more.   they do teach Plcs and robots in community college and with 2 year tech degrees but you lose a lot of the fundamental understanding and critical thinking required to see a project all the way through from cradle to grave.   In automotive industries you get a crazy diverse workforce. Yes, you will be working with hard hat wearing blue collar guys who learned the equipment as maintenance techs .  But the higher level planners are always the ones with the degree"
ECE,3974j7,sepehrhm,3,Wed Jun 10 00:09:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I think most EEs who specialize in controls field, either should enrich their curriculum with more course in Robotics and Mechanics, or they'd end up designing Control Algorithms instead of implementing them. The latter though often requires an advanced knowledge in the field, and math.  They also can do a lot of signal processing.  Honestly I think the way most EE curricula approach control is a bit defective. That approach would be more fitting in a Systems Design major, or even Math. The reality is 98% of controls out there are PID, and the vast majority of issues lie in Process Control which is almost exclusively PI, with a taste of D in it.  IIRC, Europe has a much bigger advantage in this field, compared to US."
ECE,3974j7,N8_Doge,2,Wed Jun 10 13:38:47 2015 UTC,Germany is huge for automation and control right now and definitely have much better university programs for controls.
ECE,3974j7,WiggleBooks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:50:33 2015 UTC,Do you think this would be more suited for an CompE? Or does an EE degree work fine?
ECE,3974j7,sepehrhm,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:20 2015 UTC,"No it has nothing to do with CompE, that is if the curriculum is a typical one. Most EEs focus on the theory side of things, and as I said the theory and practice of the control field kind of diverge after undergraduate level."
ECE,3974j7,WiggleBooks,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:21:36 2015 UTC,What makes you say that exactly? I thought CompEs study things like Embedded System and programming? So wouldnt they also know how to do Controls and Robotics?
ECE,3974j7,sepehrhm,2,Thu Jun 11 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"Although control and robotics share some common ground, they can be vastly different, too.  As I said, control in robotics would again, mainly be PID. Of course Computer Engineers know how to implement that, it's an algorithm after all. But, they'd not know how to come up with that algorithm in a way that it can be robust, tunable, and observable.  Control experts usually focus on systems - modelling, analysing, experimenting and controlling them. Embedded systems are a category of those, essentially.  Again - if you're interested in the practice of control, then CompE is fine provided that you apply for control jobs. But if you go for a PhD in control, then you wouldn't learn CompE, or even EE, you'd learn a lot of math."
ECE,3974j7,WiggleBooks,2,Thu Jun 11 22:35:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I see what you mean! So Mechatronics people would be best suited for designing of the control algorithms since they can model the system with their knowledge. EE can do that type of analysis.

That's why the ladder logic and operation of a PLC is meant to be a software analogy to what this person is used to, physical electricity flow diagrams with relays and latches and things. Then over the years, they've gotten more advanced, math features added, high speed I/O added and so on. I've done PLC stuff on the job as an EE, but I never even saw one in school, much less talk about it. It's really not hard at all. I learned PLCs in like one day and became our company guru by the end of the week. But many controls engineer jobs you see that require PLC knowledge are more than that. Wiring schematics, sizing of components and spec'ing projects, management of projects etc. But yeah, it's not hard at all, and certainly not very academic, that's why it's not taught in many schools."

A lot of embedded boards have FPGAs simply because the on-board MCU can't handle the job and require custom logic.  FPGAs are popular for smaller limited-run projects that do not warrant the $1mil+ tapeout cost of ASICs, and for ASIC emulation itself, also small volume.  But really, for the experienced digital designer, I2C modules are almost trivial to make, compared to other much more massive and complicated stuff they have to wrestle.

I'll answer it as a company since that's what you kind of mentioned, but we do contract a lot of the big projects out simply because we don't have the space or resources to lay everything out and design it from start to finish. We do work hand in hand with these contractors and constantly visit them to verify and test the logic as they go. Now for smaller projects such as upgrades, replacements, etc we do that in house.   My specific role is kind of a systems management position. I do activplant development which monitors our robot activity. This has a lot of logic design tied into it as well so that we can monitor statistics that are relevant to management. So a tl;dr version would be designing small end control systems."

Since we are moving away from manual labor and into the realm of 100% automated assembly lines, there will always be a market for individuals to program and configure these devices. While I agree the financial stability of some automakers is questionable, I don't think it's something to worry about. Everyone in the automotive industry is just pushed to work as much OT as they want/can, and the employers often will pay for this additional labor, sometimes even at 1.5x your ""hourly"" (salary) rate.

A decade ago, there were 385k EEs in the US. Today, it's more like 270k.  Think about that. In the last decade, we now have one third fewer EEs working in the US. Honestly, I'm a bit scared.

ECE,3970v7,CourseHeroRyan,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"First, a product would have to have a considerable standby current draw to deplete a lithium cell before you received it if initially charged/stored properly.  A lithium cell's self discharge rate is so low that it would have to have been sitting for many years before it hit the low voltage cutoff by itself.  If I had to guess (since I have no idea what product we're talking about) I'd guess that its standby current draw is just very high.  Its hardware/firmware may not be optimized for long periods of downtime.  It's possible that it has only been sitting for weeks and drained from 50%ish if this is true.  On the other hand, you still may have a faulty cell.  If you are unable to remove it and test it for yourself then I think the first reasonable step is to charge it fully, allow it to discharge under normal operating conditions, and see if it roughly meets the advertised specs.  If you want to elaborate on what kind of device we're talking about then maybe you'll receive more tailored advice."

If you got it from a random online store, then it's anecdote time.  I recently bought a bunch of small Li-ion batteries off ebay. The voltage at the connector measured 0V on each one.  I dissembled the protection circuit and measured the raw cell voltage. All of them measured around 2.7V. Most literature would call them dead beyond repair. But they were cheap and I had nothing to lose, so I charged them at 0.5C and each one came back without incident. I left them at 4.05V and now after sitting on my shelf for a month, each one is sitting around 3.95V, suggesting a very reasonable self-discharge rate of 3mV per day. I also ran some crude capacity tests that showed no noticeable degradation.  So the point of this story is, a DOA li-ion battery may not be dead, just unconscious."

ECE,396t94,mantrap2,3,Tue Jun 9 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"All true.  And if you keep this in mind, you will be a better engineer than average.   Engineering is about the practical application of scientific knowledge for human benefit so you'd think this were obvious.   Engineering is curtly: the lore of building tools to leverage human powers.  But often engineers get ""wrapped around the axle"" with the tool-building minutiae.  The technical are more predictable to deal with so it's a case of ""searching for your keys under the streetlight rather than in the alley where you remember dropping them"".  While it's a nice insight, technology also requires that we have people who have ""gone deep"" to the extent of becoming a bit antisocial or obsessive.  The best thing is to have a balance of depth with a shallower breadth.   As far as training is concerned, you can't really leave out much of the super technical stuff.  Maybe 500 years ago you could (and that's the last time anyone could become a ""Renaissance Man"" knowing ""everything"" both technical and non-technical).   What probably is a reasonable and only compromise would be to require liberals training (in theory already checked off) and specifically courses tailored to the particulars of nontechnical knowledge needed.  This doesn't happen now because academia is largely out of touch with most realities and especially with ""industry"" where these problems actually manifest - they are only just vague problems without the emotional weight of direct experience from the academic point of view.  Both the uniquely US feature of Puritanism and ""Ivory Towers"" assure that industry is ""icky"" (you don't see this in Europe or Asia, for instance).  So the twain shall never meet.  It used to be that certain ""progressive companies"" would take up the slack on this.  Hewlett-Packard when I worked for them did this.  But economics in American no longer allow it - pretty much all the programs, policies and training I went through haven't been ""a thing"" at companies like HP for 20 years now.   The same squeeze that created the 1% vs. 99% caused this as well.  The other complicated part: economics even in good times usually limit affordable talent to specialists rather than generalist because the ROI is better.   Keeping the human angle in mind is usually more of what you make sure you do in planning and design rather than a peer process to engineering broadly because you still have to ""ship product in a timely fashion and make money"", regardless.     This is what senior engineers often bring to the table that younger folks do not - not saying all but when it's there that's who usually insists on it."
ECE,396t94,thepingas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"None of this is best catagorized as a ""software engineering"" concern. These concepts generalize to any design work. Ninety percent of it applies to any group work.   Another striking result of this observation is that we are taught Software Engineering by people who are perhaps least qualified to do so. The grumpy anti-social nerd type who doesn't like much in the way of interacting with people is definitely not the right type to proselytize the human side of Software Engineering, one'd think.

ECE,392xh5,coder543,8,Tue Jun 9 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Look at the Mojo. It's a solid starter board for FPGAs, with lots of resources."
ECE,392xh5,thepingas,3,Mon Jun 8 21:50:01 2015 UTC,"The Mojo is alright but it isn't a great value and it doesn't have very much growing room.  I would definitely opt for either a TerAsic or Digilent board. If money is tight, you can get a BeMicro MAX10 for 30 bucks which IMO is a better board than the Mojo.  I personally have used the MAX10 and it's pretty nice for something as cheap as it is. You get all of the essential bits:  SDRAM, buttons and LEDs, ADC, and two 2x20 expansion headers (one single ended GPIO and the other LVDS)."
ECE,392xh5,coder543,2,Tue Jun 9 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for. The Mojo has lots of tutorials, compared to what I've seen on other boards. I'm also rather excited for the new language and IDE that Embedded Micro has developed. Perhaps not strictly useful for the job market, but I think new stuff can be interesting. The tutorials for Verilog would be very useful for learning things you need to know for professional work, and there are VHDL versions of the tutorials floating around the internet, I believe. The onboard AVR microcontroller also provides some additional functionality, like analog inputs, and you can offload a decent chunk of sequential processing to the AVR if you need to.  I'd say it's a cool board. If you're just looking for the biggest FPGA, then no, it won't pique your interest. But, it has LEDs, Analog inputs, and more GPIO then any sane hobbyist project is likely to need. There are shields you can buy if you want to add SDRAM, an enormous number of LEDs, or even some servo drivers or a camera board. That, to me, seems like room to grow."
ECE,392xh5,psycoee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:55:41 2015 UTC,"FPGA boards are pretty much interchangeable, though.  You write the Verilog/VHDL, add constraints, run the flow, and load it into the FPGA with whatever tool the board vendor provided.  Digilent is pretty much Xilinx's preferred partner for distributing to schools, so they have some really good deals that you won't find elsewhere, because Xilinx gives them all sorts of deals.  For example, you can get a board-locked license for Vivado Design Edition for $10 with that Basys3 board, so you can play around with Microblaze without paying 5 grand for the full version."
ECE,392xh5,coder543,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. I have to say that the Basys3 board looks really appealing, especially at that educational price. I hadn't heard of that one!  If I ever come up with something to do with an FPGA, I'll probably dust off my Mojo board and play with it some, but I'll definitely try to keep the Basys3 in mind if the Mojo doesn't cut it for some reason."
ECE,392xh5,anlumo,2,Tue Jun 9 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"That looks like a really nice board! I'll definitely look into it.  It doesn't seem to be compatible with Vivado / ISE though, which is a bit of a downside to me."
ECE,392xh5,morto00x,3,Mon Jun 8 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"I've used it with ISE, works fine. Vivado doesn't support the Spartan 6, so that won't work."

ECE,392xh5,frankenbeans,4,Mon Jun 8 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"Me too. Overall it's pretty good but I have two criticisms:   Not enough RAM for a framebuffer. At best you can do qqVGA at 3 bits per pixel! Not many GPIOs - 8 dedicated leds and 8 switches, which is good when you first start but not so great for bigger projects.   On the plus side, Digilent support helped me fix the board when I somehow screwed up the device ID!  Note that if you are a student the new Basys 3 is only $10 more."

Has tons of switches/LEDs/buttons/etc for starting out with basic combinatorial and state machine stuff, and has a couple different oscillators onboard to clock synchronous designs. Once you get comfortable with things, there's more than enough peripherals (SDRAM, SRAM, flash, SD card, VGA output, etc) to keep you busy for years working with soft processors if you want to go that direction. There's two 40 pin headers providing tons of GPIO for hooking up external things, or connecting up a MSO or logic analyzer.

ECE,393xlm,I_C_U_2,2,Tue Jun 9 02:12:59 2015 UTC,looks like C1 is the timing capacitor on pin 2 and R1 is the load resistor on pin 3.
ECE,393xlm,thyratron,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:16:01 2015 UTC,Are you referencing the 'Test Circuit and Waveform' schematic or the 'Minimum Component Tachometer' schematic?  And for either of those they have another capacitor C2 also on pin 3.  How do I determine the correct value for C2?  The 'Zener Regulated Frequency to Voltage Converter' schematic would work for my application except that it is 66Hz/V on Vout.  That would need to change to 150Hz/V and I am not exactly sure changing R1 to 1KΩ and C1 to 55µF would fix that.
ECE,393xlm,thyratron,2,Tue Jun 9 11:52:19 2015 UTC,"C2 (on pin 3) is the filter cap and controls the amount of ripple on the output.    There's also the gain constant K since the zener circuit uses the op amp stages in the chip.  Solving for K from the component values and 66Hz/V gives K = 630. Changing C1 to 55µ and R1 to 1kΩ gives (12V * 55µF * 1kΩ * 630)-1 = 0.0024 Hz/V. To get 1V at 150Hz, R1 * C1 should be 0.88 µs.  1kΩ * 55µF = 55ms."

ECE,391fvf,NiceBump,10,Mon Jun 8 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"according to this a lightning strike only lasts 10 to 50 microseconds, so response time is going to be absolutely critical.  While most micro controllers can get a few operations done during that time, I don't know that any existing camera is going to have that fast of a shutter speed.  IMO, you may be better off setting up a camera to do long exposure time lapse shots then just sifting through them to find a strike."

ECE,391fvf,Alacritous,3,Mon Jun 8 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"You have to use a rolling buffer to constantly film, and when you detect lightning you chop out the last frame taken.  No idea why you'd want GPS coordinates if the camera is in one spot, but that's up to you.  If you're trying to figure out the GPS coords of where the lightning struck that's not going to be fun.  The Pi 2 can probably do the filming and detection in general though."

ECE,391fvf,nukii,2,Mon Jun 8 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"As others said, you want to have a high-speed camera filming permanently. Lighting bolts travel at around 100,000 km/s (that's 1/3 of the speed of light). That doesn't give much time to your sensor to detect the bolt, process that information (not happening with Arduino or RPi) and activate the camera (you'll need a very very fast response camera which isn't cheap).  Also, you'll need at least 3 cameras (triangulation) and some image processing to figure out where the lightning bolt lands. GPS can't be applied here."

There'd be essential two circuits after that. 1) Control power for the microprocessor and 2) Output power for the motors. The output power would be feed through a relay controlled by the microprocessor in this case. You should also add a local estop button in series.

Professionals members, almost nothing I did would make sense.  Second of all, my chapter did alright the year I was an officer, but even a few years out it sounded like it was back in disarray or relatively nonexistent. So long term, the changes did not help. Writing down our strategy may have helped.   As for potentially helpful tips I had a few things going   the officers were mostly seniors (our school only had undergrad ECE). This is out of your current control and doesn't exactly mean much.  all the officers knew where we were and were dedicated to improving the chapter/clubs campus profile and effectiveness.  the officers encouraged the underclassmen to come by the weekly meetings for club updates and for academic help. We weren't all TAs, but we had been through the same classes and might have some insight without just giving them the answer. This actually turned the dedicated members into the study groups they should've been part of already. Really, it just encouraged the social and academic networking they do not exactly teach you in lectures.  officers went into classes, with professor approval, to encourage the students to come to meetings and to inform the students and professors about what we were doing. I think I had a 5 minutes spiel with a few key points.  we also only had a couple events through the year. One was with a local organization and potentially had local engineers attended. It was a great opportunity to encourage social participation and networking, even if it was minimal. I was a member in another club with some people in CS, EET, and CET. In the past these majors were not included in IEEE, even though they should've been. With a little help I encouraged them to attend meetings.    Those were a few things I remember doing. I think most of it came from the club advisor or from brainstorming between the members/officers at the beginning of the year.   Tl;dr treated the IEEE academic club with goals focused on encouraging academic conversations and communication necessary to enter into the professional world. Grew awareness beyond the traditional members."
ECE,38y14i,DCheeso06,2,Sat Jun 13 00:06:43 2015 UTC,"I actually found that officers were best as juniors, because by senior year they were too busy with other shit (capstone and so on.) I was part of a student chapter as well."
ECE,38y14i,zephyrus299,2,Sat Jun 13 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. It probably would have been better if we were juniors. I felt that being seniors gave us a little more experience, but it did make it so that we were really busy between classes, projects, and the club.  It was partly my choosing, but for my senior year I basically lived in the academic building where we did everything from Monday through Saturday. We had a lot of fun though when we had down time and just were hanging around there."

The magazines make it worth it if you pay for the student membership.   Also, most universities have agreements with IEEE that give you full access to their papers. So oftentimes, you don't really need to be a member.  If you need a professional membership, your company should be paying for it.  edit: typo"

ECE,38y14i,Qi_Pa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although I should probably note bias first--I was an officer (minor position) one year in school and IEEE student branch chairman the last two years.  Now that I've graduated I'm active in my local section.  Now that I've got my bias out of the way here's why I think joining as a student is beneficial.  Ok, so first and foremost joining as a student is cheap, like $32/year cheap.  It's more expensive as a graduate but a lot of businesses will pay for your membership as it's beneficial if you're going after your PE.  You want to join early (if you're planning on being a member for a long time) as the earlier you join the earlier you can become a life member and never have to pay dues again (your age plus years as a member has to add up to some number, I think it's 110 or something).  Second, and more important than the first, is that meetings give you a chance to learn about multiple different aspects of electrical engineering.  Also those meetings give you two things--hours for your PE and networking.  Most businesses that prefer their employees to have their PE will advertise meetings that offer professional hours for your PE so this may or may not be a big advantage.  Another benefit from these meetings is networking which is really nice in case you want to switch jobs and need someone who can give you information about the job and can vouch for the kind of person you are.  So yeah, I think it's great, but then again I'm not pretending to not be biased so YMMV."

Try ISO or IEC.  $700 a pop for pretty much anything, and you need to buy a good couple of dozen of them to even figure out that you bought the wrong series.  Oh, and they get updated every year or two, so it's not even much of an investment.  And I have yet to find a library that has any kind of access to that stuff.  By the way, if you just want to download papers from one or two journals and you are done with school, get a society membership.  It's actually fairly reasonably priced and generally allows you to download all of that society's journals and conferences.  Granted, if your interests span a few fields, that's a bit more difficult.  But yeah, for the average person outside academia, IEEE is fairly pointless.  If you go to conferences, it might be worth it, because the member discount is typically at least $200 or so."

Like say, when the pot has a current of 2A the buzzer goes off? You said load so I assume you mean current.   If that's the case, you could just put a diode in series with the pot before the buzzer. Since they're in series they'll get the same load, and  when 2A is reached, that will be the load on the pot and the diode will trigger and let current pass.   Though, this way means that it is an open circuit until 2A in reached, so if you need it to be live continuously you'd need to do something slightly different."

If you can transfer to another school without taking on a sizable amount of extra debt that may be a good option. However, it sounds like you are very motivated and that you are trying to learn as much as you can. That is what is important. You said your school is accredited so as long as the school doesn't have a bad reputation with industry hiring managers you should be fine. What I would focus on is networking as much as possible and getting some  seriously solid internships."
ECE,38vvdn,fatangaboo,3,Sun Jun 7 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Keep your GPA up, try to to do something resembling undergrad research, get some internships, and get out of there.  In the end, it's really about how motivated you are to do stuff.    For grad school, it's important to have good faculty recommendations, so try to build a good working relationship with at least one or two faculty members and don't burn too many bridges.  Again, don't be afraid to venture outside of your department a bit.  An EE can make a huge difference in (for example) a civil or mechanical engineering lab, programming microcontrollers or other embedded systems.  Making a huge difference means getting great recommendations.  Most grad schools realize that not everyone has ideal opportunities; the outcome is a lot more important than the exact topic.  A letter where somebody says ""this is the best student I've seen in X years"" carries a lot of weight, even if the recommender is from another department.  Also, the classes you take pretty much don't matter for the path you choose in grad school.  Try to take high-quality classes with good professors, even if they are less relevant to your goals.  Having a solid grasp of fundamentals always helps, and you never know when something will come in useful.  Doing stuff on your own is a great way to fill in the gaps; for example, you can certainly go beyond the minimum requirements for a project."
ECE,38vvdn,icydocking,2,Sun Jun 7 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and perspective. It sounds like I am actually fairly ignorant about getting into grad school, so I'll need to re-think that. I honestly had not considered working outside of the department, and thought that related undergrad courses would be crucial. The good news is I still have about two years left and a couple of CompE graduate level faculty who I haven't met, so maybe there are still some decent opportunities.  I completely agree about doing personal projects and extending school ones; my goal for this Computer Organization class is a pipelined implementation of the full MIPS32 core instruction set ;)"
ECE,38vvdn,icydocking,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:32:35 2015 UTC,"This seems like good advice. I tried but failed to get an internship this summer, so I may have to look into doing a co-op (if it pays enough to offset graduating a semester late) - otherwise there's just one summer left if I'm graduating in 2 years.   It's crazy to think that I have just one big opportunity left when I've only taken a few ECE classes and met a couple professors so far, but I guess that's where networking and personal projects come in. At the beginning, four years of school sounded incredibly long; now that I'm halfway through, it seems ridiculously short (although I'll be glad to finish). Thanks."
ECE,38vvdn,3838,2,Sun Jun 7 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"If you want to do more advanced projects, I'd say just do some more advanced projects. Only the very top end of undergraduate curriculum do things like that bitbanging NTSC, and it's a lot less fun when you've got deadlines for multiple projects like that looming over your head.  My school was similarly poor when it came to digital design, so I bought a $60 FPGA development board and taught myself as much as I could with it. I quickly became the best undergrad with FPGAs  and then one of the graduate professors came to me and asked me to do some research with him.  Do you have access to labs there outside of class? You might need to ask the professor in charge of the lab in person for it (email rarely works with professors). That should give you access to the equipment you need, and the rest is up to you."
ECE,38vvdn,3838,2,Sun Jun 7 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, no one is stopping me from doing advanced projects. I've been doing some more ambitious stuff at home, but had assumed based on courses / teachers so far that no one would care much about my projects... maybe that's too cynical and too hasty of a judgment.  How did you end up getting the attention of the graduate professor? Did you try to introduce yourself to a lot of people and make your interests known, or did you just get noticed after spending lots of time in the lab?"
ECE,38vvdn,jubjub7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I talked about some of the things I was doing with my FPGA board with my lab professor (he ran all of the labs for ELE/CE so was in there most of the time). Spending time in the lab outside of class definitely helped with getting to know him better.  The graduate professor then asked my lab professor if he knew anyone good with FPGAs, and my name came up.  I just re-read some of what you wrote and if I understand correctly you're going to be starting junior year? That's when I found that things really started picking up (it was also when I picked up my FPGA board). The first two years are usually used to try and get all the of the students up to the same level, so if you're ahead of others you basically have to wait while others catch up (that's also why schools like MIT and Cornell have more interesting projects, as they select the top level already). I also took on a physics major which helped to keep me busy the first two years, though I don't know if that is an option for you at this point."
ECE,38vvdn,MantaSquad,2,Mon Jun 8 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"Apply for graduate fellowships.  If you get a tip top fellowship (Hertz, NSF) you will automatically be accepted at any and every ECE grad school, everywhere.  Including MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, and even Florida State.  However you will need to pass their Ph.D. qualifying exam during your first year, to be allowed to stay there."

ECE,38vanv,gettinganinternship,12,Sun Jun 7 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"Do you know what it means to be a computer architect?  It means, ""hey, we want to hire you to work on fundamentally redefining computing and memory architectures, despite the fact that thousands upon thousands of engineers work on similar problems and never come up with anything revolutionary.""   It's arrogant to think you could contribute anything without first becoming an expert on what's been done before you. Do you know what we call people who spend a significant time educating themselves on whats been done, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.  We call them ""doctor""."
ECE,38vanv,tty2,5,Sun Jun 7 04:44:43 2015 UTC,I have to step in here an contradict you :(. At Intel lots of people are computer architects with a masters degree. I don't think there are even enough PhDs around to fill the all the positions. It's just digital logic... And chip design hasn't really had major changes that make previous skills obsolete... Its not like new designs are started completely from scratch - usually the previous project is at east a baseline or guide. Not voodoo magic like chip fabrication. If you want to work for a fab... That is where you need a Phd.
ECE,38vanv,hondaaccords,6,Sun Jun 7 07:35:40 2015 UTC,"I have a sneaking suspicion that different companies/labs use the title ""computer architect"" to mean somewhat different things."
ECE,38vanv,the_peanut_gallery,2,Sun Jun 7 11:55:50 2015 UTC,"Not voodoo magic like chip fabrication. If you want to work for a fab... That is where you need a Phd.   Absolutely, completely false.  Being a digital designer does not make you an ""architect"" with respect to the field of computer architecture. Typically adjusting number of pipeline stages for some logic block is considered trivial. Again, digital design is not ""computer architecture"". I am sure Intel has people doing architecture without PhDs, of course - but they very seldom hire them into that role without a PhD or experience at another company doing that relevant work.   It's just digital logic... And chip design hasn't really had major changes that make previous skills obsolete... Its not like new designs are started completely from scratch - usually the previous project is at east a baseline or guide.   This is where you clearly don't understand what we're talking about. We are not talking about being a digital design engineer. I think you probably don't actually work in the field and you're talking out your ass because you have confused designing integrated circuits with ""computer architecture"".  Yes, some people work as a job that may have ""architecture"" in the title without a PhD, but to the point of the poster, I am responding to why most job postings request a PhD. Period. Not saying that 100% of jobs in the field require it. But explaining why the overwhelming majority of jobs with that title request it."
ECE,38vanv,tty2,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:51:07 2015 UTC,"Hi tty2, I don't post a lot on reddit but I have seen some of your comments on this subreddit, and I have generally thought they are high quality. I just saw an opportunity to contribute a different perspective here. I am still early career but I have worked for two fortune 50 semiconductor companies in various roles, possess a electrical engineering degree and have friends who are computer architects as well as digital designers, microcoders, layout engineers, validation engineers etc. I never said that an architect is the same thing as a designer. I said that architecture is ultimately just digital logic- which is absolutely true. At the end of the day that is what digital computers are built upon. Architects are expected to just look at it from a higher level perspective than a designer most of the time- but they also need to know the lower level stuff. My perspective might be different than yours because I am early career and have seen friends hired as architects with masters degrees (on the projects) directly out of school. My take has been that architecture positions are the most competitive ones, and generally your need to be pretty bright and have a masters degree to get in. My perspective may be a little different because of my youth and I have definitely seen PhDs working on microarchitecure - but from what I can tell if you are smart a masters degree is he best bang for your buck right now."
ECE,38vanv,hondaaccords,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:33:48 2015 UTC,"Not voodoo magic like chip fabrication. If you want to work for a fab... That is where you need a Phd.   You can absolutely work in a fab without a PhD.  If you want to be a high-level guy or get to manage/steer your own research group, that's different (and is going to require a graduate degree or a ton of luck and experience), but I know different people with Bachelor's in EE, ChemE, and Physics who have worked in entry-level positions in fabs for major companies.  They do tend to evaluate them for a year or two and then push them towards grad school though."
ECE,38vanv,Evidence_Of_Absence,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:44:29 2015 UTC,I agree - I guess I just don't consider the fab positions you can get without a Phd very interesting. At least for EE. I still misspoke.
ECE,38vanv,hondaaccords,3,Mon Jun 8 07:35:44 2015 UTC,"Because a PhD gives you a lot more experience in creating novel ideas, designing experiments, analysing data, and a lot of other skills that aren't taught in classes. I did a master's focused on computer architecture, and I absolutely do not have the experience that would be needed to be productive in an architect role. If you want to do RTL or logic design, then a master's is usually sufficient."
ECE,38vanv,jrmrjnck,3,Sun Jun 7 04:50:13 2015 UTC,"As someone with a PhD in Computer Architecture.  I honestly think you don't need one if your goal is to build something.  In research, nowadays a PhD is almost a perquisite. However, you state ""working with RTL is awesome"".  The vast majority of people with PhDs in CompArch sadly don't do much of that.  Academic computer architecture research is about half CS and half ECE.  It is actually common for the CS types to barely know any verilog.  A lot of computer architecture research comes in the form of performance modeling (C/C++ simulator work) to test out new ideas.  It's rarer than it should be that someone takes it all the way to verilog/synthesis.  If in the end you don't want to do research,  a masters may be enough.  Most of the guys I've met on the product team at my company are masters only (or PhD dropouts).  They may have not started where they are, but they worked their way into it.  Having a masters from a top tier research school obviously wouldn't hurt though.  A lot look down on masters, I think, because it's hard to separate the people who are actually passionate from those doing the masters for the money.  A PhD (or at least attempting one), shows that the person has to be at least somewhat passionate about it,  since a PhD makes no financial sense."
ECE,38vanv,mhayenga,2,Sun Jun 7 18:00:19 2015 UTC,"Not all people doing computer architecture at multi-billion market cap companies are PhDs. The barrier to entry here isn't having a PhD. It is really quite competitive, there are so few people who wear the computer architecture hat. These aren't the people focused on writing the RTL these are people fundamentally redefining specification and proving it is both a good and possible to build ideas. Don't think that having a PhD in a tangential research area makes you competitive here. Doing interesting work that is set to redefine computing makes you interesting--wherever that might be."
ECE,38vanv,lovelikepie,-5,Sun Jun 7 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"The major reason is there is so much competition for ""top corporate jobs"" involving this area.  Basically that becomes the measure because generally kids have no actual work experience - you use academic measures when the prefer metric missing.  Only experience really says if you are a bullshit artist or an actual asset.  When you don't have that it's hard to really say - you have to cut through the bullshit and interview really aggressively to tease out the truth.   A case of looking for your keys under the lamppost rather than in the alley - it's an engineer's search/test algorithm.  Now if you go non-top-corporate(and maybe take the salary risk - honestly maybe not), you can do leading edge architecture work for smaller companies or even for start-ups.  Is it as ""glam""?  I don't know, I suppose not but big companies aren't all they are cracked up to be (trust me I worked for a Fortune 20 company).  You might consider starting a company if you grok a particular high demand problem better than Intel/Nvidia - yes, it's possible, or you know someone who has such an idea.     What idea is that?  Hell if I know - that's what you'd need to figure out - you are the subject matter expert, not me!   For me, ""big company"" says ""high risk of layoff"", ""dull, dull, dull"", ""bureaucratic"" and ""non-leading edge"".    That's what I've personally seen as the reality.  I'd rather be a homeless person or work overseas than work for a ""big company"" or the ""gubment"" or its minions.   Been there; done that; it sucks (for me).  I do not get the fascination but then again ""people say"" that millenials are risk averse, unimaginative, authority-fallating pussies (just what I've heard) so if that were true, you probably would get off on ""big corporate"" jobs.   You're foolish if you do, but if you've been raised/groomed to be a sheep then sheep jobs will appeal.  Maybe you'll learn before you are middle-aged.  There are also other non-traditional areas for architecture types of knowledge.  Strictly there have to be, because the world doesn't really need 1000 more top-performance, general purpose CPU/GPU mavens.  After Intel, ARM and Nvidia are done, the jobs are simply mostly not going to be for that purpose - their current employees can handle what comes up from here.  In our case, we implement certain DSP functions as part of our firmware for our test systems in FPGAs which involves some pretty advanced computation - it's RTL based, dataflow pipelines.  One version uses an FPGA, another version uses a GPU.  The high level interface is the same for either; the computational is about the same with different cost/performance trades.  The difference is market positioning and customer price/performance needs (production vs. engineering).  So having this kind of knowledge would be useful but we don't really need a full-on PhD.    Frankly a PhD generally doesn't mean you actually know much more than an MS.  It means you know some tiny pimple of knowledge better than anyone else until you are obsoleted in 9-18 months or so.  It also means you have a proven track-record of being able to achieve such a level of knowledge if necessary.     Sometimes that's nice but it's not the specific knowledge but a ""je en sais qua"" level of self-discipline you are buying as an employer.  That and the mindless tribal masturbation about the name on the piece of paper.   It also means you may have an insufferable ego that makes it difficult to be a team-player as well - Phds are too often the worse possible employees so that's something you have to be careful about in hiring.  There is no ""formula"" for the choice.  MSEEs can also be insufferable assholes as well so same-same.  MS or PhD could work.   It just depends on the individual.  (Are we hiring?  Sorry, no, not at the moment)"
ECE,38vanv,mantrap2,2,Sun Jun 7 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"Is there some reason your post seems a bit butthurt?   Basically that becomes the measure because generally kids have no actual work experience - you use academic measures when the prefer metric missing.   Any PhD from a good program should have extensive internship experience.  Also, not sure why you think academia isn't real work.  Doing something new, making it work, making people excited about it, and getting a paper into ISSCC or VLSI is a lot harder than you might think.  Most of the big chip and CAD companies were started by PhDs, straight from their research.  Same goes for most of those startups doing cool new things.   It also means you may have an insufferable ego that makes it difficult to be a team-player as well - Phds are too often the worse possible employees so that's something you have to be careful about in hiring.   You are talking entirely out of your ass here.  I don't know what kind of PhDs you've been dealing with, but you most definitely have to be a team player with excellent communication skills to survive in a good program.  Most projects involve several students, industry partners, and various outside suppliers.  Most of the learning happens from other (more senior) students, not from classes or books.  You generally have to do everything yourself, from finding vendors and dealing with them all the way to writing documentation.  It's a lot like doing a startup, on a smaller scale.  Good luck doing any of this if you are a massive douchebag with an insufferable ego."

This causes a change in the magnetic flux through the shape of the cable, which induces a current through the cable.   That induced current, by Gauss's law for magnetism (net magnetic flux out of a closed surface = 0), causes a change in magnetic flux equal in magnitude but in the opposite direction to the change in magnetic flux caused by the machine.  If it's set up like a transformer as you say, the cable might be the ""secondary coil"" of a transformer, and that's how they're generating current on it."

ECE,38qznu,bananinhao,3,Sat Jun 6 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"It can be a very low voltage though, which may be confusing to some transformer newbies.  For OP:  n:1 primary windings:secondary windings ratio on an [ideal] transformer yields n:1 primary voltage:secondary voltage ratio, and 1:n primary current:secondary current ratio. This is because power (=watts, =current * voltage) generated by the primary winding must be equal to power consumed by the secondary winding (so the voltage/current relationship in [ideal] transformers is inverse - if voltage goes up, current must go down (assuming constant power generated))"
ECE,38qznu,Runenmeister,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, but if you short the ends, there is current flowing through the short. If there's current flowing in the winding, there must be a voltage drop from Ohm's law. The ends are at the same potential what part has the highest potential?"

There is voltage across any two points in the wire because of this, and that is enough to cause a current flow.  Try it out yourself. If you have a single, closed loop of wire (single loop reduces stray capacitance and inductance to negligible amounts) and a magnet and move the wire around the magnet (which gives a changing magnetic field with respect to the closed loop of wire), you'll see a current flow. That means at any two points across the loop of wire there is a voltage difference causing current according to Ohm's Law, where R would be the equivalent resistance between the two points (negligible but nonzero*).    *Note, for superconductors where internal resistance truly equals 0, you'd best consult a quantum physicist to tell me how much current you'd create in the same scenario :)"

Saying an induced voltage causes current or an induced current causes a voltage are literally the exact same thing.

If the net magnetic flux through a surface is always 0, then dΦ/dt=0 and there's no induced voltage around the edge of that surface.  A simple example: you have two inductors L1 and L2 with mutual inductance M. Then  Φ1 = L1·I1 + M·I2  Φ2 = L2·I2 + M·I1  For each flux to equal 0, you need additional conditions."

ECE,38qznu,Runenmeister,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:20:08 2015 UTC,"The voltage can be low and current can be high, as is what can happen in a high-turns-ratio transformer. Ohm's Law applies in the frequency domain with the impedances, not the time domain solely with resistances in AC circuitry like transformers (a change in magnetic field, without a moving magnet, implies AC). I'm not sure how those work if R=0, though, other than just acting as perfectly lossless transformers lol."

ECE,38qznu,gnu_bag,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:42:49 2015 UTC,I think a better question for you instead of where is the voltage difference is where is the electric field.
ECE,38qznu,psycoee,2,Sun Jun 7 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"No.  You have to have a voltage difference.  This is actually central to how guarding low level current leakage is done: you force the guard shield to the same voltage as your shielded line and because the voltage difference is zero, the leakage current is forced to zero fA."
ECE,38qznu,uint128_t,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:44:41 2015 UTC,I used to do tests on such a rig. It's a transformer with a very high turns ratio. You are connecting the cable to the secondary coil with very few turns and heavy gauge to take lots of current. The primary coil will have many many turns. The variac can adjust the voltage applied to the primary and therefore the current in the secondary.   There will be voltage present on the output but we're talking about as low as 50mV or less.
ECE,38qznu,alle0441,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"There can't be a current without a voltage difference; that would obviously violate Ohm's law (unless the cable happens to be a superconductor).  However, if the resistance is tiny (which it would be for a fat cable), the voltage drop will be negligible even for a very large current.  If your question is about how the voltage is created: Faraday's law.   The line integral of the electric field around a closed loop is equal to the negative of the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the loop.   The changing magnetic flux from the transformer induces a voltage drop in the loop of wire, which then gives rise to a current."

It's okay to admit you don't know a topic or skill (within reason), but not if you listed it on your resume. I find that looking at old project code/documentation/presentations is very helpful because it refreshes the list of things I need to review, and also brings back stories about working in teams, etc. (Interviewers always like to hear stories.)"

ECE,38oqmg,falconPancho,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:00:45 2015 UTC,This is just me and my opinion. I've interviewed a lot of candidates recently and in my career. I would count this against you.  Take everything posters say with a grain of salt. They may have enough charisma that they can pull off the interview because they were the right candidate to start with.   My questions for embedded would be tailored to your resume and generally I will ask a bit about everything.  If you write it on your resume and is a multi person interview we may break up into sections before your inevitable and align each expert with each topic.  So you better not feign skills you don't have.   For example is you write the word op amps be ready to tell me what am op amp how the inputs work and draw a differential amplifier and explain the formula.  I'd you don't remember best to be honest and say i don't remember but I recall how to do an integrator or something so we don't sit in dead awkward silence.
ECE,38oqmg,jeffbell,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"It's an excellent preparation tool and it might be good as a distraction as you are waiting in the lobby.  It would be awkward to search through it during the interview.  A table of physical constants (permissivity of free space) or your ten favorite integrals, maybe."
ECE,38nf1i,kri8,5,Fri Jun 5 10:05:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by the ""reflection property"". Googling ""Fourier transform reflection property"" doesn't return any useful hints. I think you mean the time-scaling property with a scaling factor of -1.  It looks like you are not applying this property correctly. For example, if your initial function is u(1-t), and you scale time by -1, you should get u(1+t) instead of u(-1+t)."
ECE,38nf1i,thephoton,0,Fri Jun 5 16:49:40 2015 UTC,Yea I meant time scaling by -1. I think I was just applying the reflection wrong. Thanks for pointing that out.
ECE,38nf1i,rlbond86,5,Fri Jun 5 22:05:21 2015 UTC,The Fourier transform is a linear transform; all of the operations commute. You are making a mistake.
ECE,38nf1i,toohyetoreply,2,Fri Jun 5 19:36:07 2015 UTC,I think the error comes from your first substitution.  -2(t-1) != 2((-t)-1)         != 2(-t-1)         != -2(t+1)   Same with  u(t-1) != u(1-(-t))        != u(t+1)
ECE,38nf1i,mmdoogie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure /u/thephoton has it right... The ""reflection"" is multiplying only t by -1.  It's a time reversal only.  F{e2(t-1) u(1-t)} = X(jΩ) becomes F{e2(-t-1) u(1-(-t))} = X(-jΩ) which simplifies to F{e-2(t+1) u(t+1)} = X(jΩ) and if you continue from there with the delay you'll get the answer being looked for.  In your original case, doing the delay step first removes the chance to make this error of multiplying the whole quantity by -1 instead of  only the t, which is why the answer came out correct when doing the delay step first."

The information there though will be the foundation for all of your analog systems classes.   If you feel that you can refresh your memory when the time comes, take the credits. If you don't think you will be able to, take the class.   Personally, I took the credits and I'm glad I did. One of my classes this past semester though was much harder than it could have been since I was using physics stuff I hadn't seen since high school (3 years ago).  Also: it is spelled t.u. , but that's irrelevant.  I'm on mobile so I can't exactly answer all of your questions. But if I get back with any kind of energy left ill take a crack at them."

I'd recommend looking at the age of the machines involved... if they're new enough to have (eg.) brushless servos, then they have electronics sensitive to surges.  Make sure the control electronics are protected.  If you have any really expensive/new machines, consider protecting them completely, but for the most part AC drives and basic durability protect everything but the control electronics."
ECE,38o14w,Accujack,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:26:08 2015 UTC,but for the most part AC drives and basic durability protect everything but the control electronics.   ?? I thought modern industrial standards include durability under surge conditions. Shouldn't the control electronics now protect themselves? I'd be more worried about control electronics that is 10+ years old.
ECE,38o14w,jms_nh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:17:43 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't the control electronics now protect themselves?   To a point, sure.  It depends on whether you want to replace the $50 protection device on the wall or the $500 one inside the machine in the event of a surge.  Control electronics in modern machine tools are industrial computers with a lot of durability, but it comes with a high price."
ECE,38o14w,Accujack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"I don't want to have to replace either; if there's a surge, I expect some element to fail safely in a replaceable/resettable manner. Industrial drives/controllers tend to be expensive already, and the incremental cost to do this shouldn't be a big deal."
ECE,38o14w,jms_nh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"If you're not going to do anything else, tie a loose overhand knot in the AC power cord; it will add inductance that will go a little bit towards reducing surge currents. Beyond that, I'm not sure what you should do (if anything). Older surge protectors with MOVs can raise the risk of fires.  I wouldn't pay any $$$ to a company cold-calling me to provide a service.

ECE,38kwx4,CircuitBeast,8,Thu Jun 4 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"For work, you skim it and figure loosely what it can and can't tell you. When a specific issue comes up that you need that info, you go back and read in detail."
ECE,38kwx4,SrSkippy,11,Thu Jun 4 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"Gray and Meyer heavy?  It's pretty thin actually.  And light weight.  Generally you go through them paired with lectures so it basically spoon-fed to you at a common pace.  Sometimes there's variance between lecture and textbook but that's usually minor or trivial.  Learning involves multiple modalities and it's been long shown that visual (chalkboard and reading), auditory (lecture) and tactile (writing notes) is the best way to form lasting memories.  You generally do NOT simply memorize.  That's is Epic Fail because memorization alone usually means you really do not understand shit.  You actually need to understand what it all means.  Especially true with G&M.  In the specific case of Gray & Meyer, you've already had lots of circuit analysis and theory before you get to that text so none of it is really surprising or new.  Further, you'd only be taking a class that required Gray & Meyer if you were actually interesting in IC circuit design or IC processing.  If you were in power, controls, computer architecture, etc. you likely would never see G&M in any class.  If you've also been practicing the profession (internships and hobbies) and studying the profession (reading trades diligently, talking to working engineers and generally being curious), you likely have already seen or heard of all the subjects in G&M at a 30,000 foot level (i.e. you are probably ""buzzword compliant"" or have used exactly these types of circuits at a highly abstracted level (e.g. Op Amps) but simply don't know all the details of the innards).   So, again, it's not unfamiliar territory and you can ""launch"" from that knowledge.  Finally, there is NO substitute from grinding on homework problems and working calculations.  Patience, diligence and persistence is central to engineering.  The crazy pace in school is partly training you for more of the same professionally in the near future.  The sooner you subsume that into something you don't even have to think twice about to just do, the better.  Once you graduate and have to use the textbook for something at work, well, you remember there was something you saw in G&M about a work situation so you crack open that chapter and refresh your memory.   What specifically?  You can't tell now.  Sometimes you need to find a formula or you need to look at a formula to grok what a sensitive parameter or dependency is for a situation.  Sometimes you need to remember how to design a certain type of circuit.  It can be anything.   The key is you've already gone through everything so it's mostly just hinting and refreshing what you already know/remember.  This is where ""really understanding"" matters because it means you aren't really having to memorize that much - you know the general concepts and can recapitulate the details on demand."
ECE,38kwx4,mantrap2,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure Gray & Meyer (now called: Gray, Hurst, et al (link)   -- 896 pages, 3.4 pounds) is only useful for IC designers.  It's one of the few good BJT circuit design books available, even for non-IC (board level) designers.  And unlike other books, it works through circuit analyses in detail, without skipping steps, so readers can follow the algebra and the approximations made."

ECE,38kwx4,dbag22,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:45:05 2015 UTC,"I think mantrap2's comment was pretty good.  If you want to learn a new topic, get a book and work through the problems.  It's precisely like physical training.  The problems are hard when you start and you build strength through repetition.  Journal articles can be more difficult, in that you can't work through problems and they rarely provide sufficient information to replicate their results.  You can learn a lot by attempting to do just that, however, and this cutting-edge stuff can really improve your technical chops.  The difference is you have to push yourself.  Nobody is there to help you, and you're on your own schedule.  This can be nice as long as you are properly motivated.  Just have to figure out a motivation for yourself and keep on it.  Just like a workout schedule.  It's hardest to get started but easy to keep going once it's a habit.  Only other advice I have beyond that is not to get bogged down in the first couple chapters of a book from a new field.  Skim them and get to the meat of the book, the applied sections you were interested in.  Once you find that you need the basis for understanding that material, you can then go back to the beginning and learn the introductory material.  This would be akin to skipping the crystal structure/manufacturing part of an undergraduate electronics textbook and going straight to the chapter on FET devices, and then going back to the beginning when you need to understand how and why parasitic latches occur."

IF you end up working on microcontrollers (be it circuit design or firmware), there is a good enough chance you'll use a part from an Atmel line (or similar one).  My advice, (if you really want to do microcontroller work) is to buy an Arduino and install Atmel Studio (dont use the Arduino IDE, it's terrible...though it's compiler is needed for Atmel Studio so you still need to install it).  Arduino has a large community where you will find endless project examples and people willing/able to help you overcome obstacles you encounter (this benefit is not found on any other platform I know of, at least not to the same amount).  More importantly, you'd still gain all of the skills you would by using any other microcontroller (TI, Microchip, ST, etc); mainly learning how to configure the part and utilizing various sub-systems on the chip.

I understand the basic idea of a MOSFET but can't calculate jack. Also on my resume I have nothing related to Ece on it beside required projects from intro engineering.
ECE,38hdnu,workadaylolcat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel the same way. My GPA isn't too far off from yours, maybe a bit higher. But altogether, I finished a lot of junior level classes this year and felt like I got dragged through the mud.   This summer, I'll be spending some time working on some sort of project. Haven't figured it out yet. But honestly, with what little I know, I can say that worrying about not knowing anything only makes your anxiety worse. Being proactive about your career I've found to be the only way to combat the anxiety of ""not knowing.""   It's unfortunate that so little work is hands on in engineering, but my experiences seem to back up that notion in this thread."
ECE,38hdnu,BurningBushJr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"I want to try to do a diy project at home but idk where to start.   You start with an objective and work from there. Back in junior college, after I decided that I wanted to study EE, I thought I would make an electronic door lock. I started out with a Basic Stamp II because that was the goto (no pun intended) hobbiest-cheese-grade microcontroller. I looked at some sample code, worked out how to read a matrix keypad and then ended up with something usable that I could hook up to my garage door.  Three months later I had the same thing working on a ATMEGA16 I programmed in ASM.  You can't stagnate in college. Doing well in classes is not enough. I feel confident that If I didn't do any personal projects while in school, I wouldn't have learned 1/3 of what I did. Personal projects led me to take interesting classes and interesting classes led me to persue personal projects. My strange obsession with a particular personal project is DIRECTLY what led to my current job (along with a boat load of luck)."
ECE,38hdnu,spainguy,2,Thu Jun 4 09:41:53 2015 UTC,"This.  Sadly (unless things have changed in the 15 years since I've been out of school) you learn a lot of book knowledge in college, and the rest on your own.  If you aren't learning stuff on your own time along with college, you aren't going to be as successful as you can be."
ECE,38eqtw,rocketraccoon48,15,Wed Jun 3 18:57:18 2015 UTC,I'm not naturally smart. I have to study for a bit to get good grades.   Dude everyone has to study in engineering.

ECE,38eqtw,mormreed,13,Thu Jun 4 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"Nothing you've listed about yourself prevents you from having a successful career in EE.  Look into the potential career paths offered by the various disciplines of EE and determine if they interest you.  If so, go for it.  A major benefit to EE (as mentioned by /u/RowingCox) is that the field is huge.  Uber-huge, your BSEE will, at best, scratch the surface of EE.  You will be something like a jack-of-all-(EE)-trades, and master of none.  Your EE degree will also be a step toward a number of careers/industries you've never even thought about."
ECE,38eqtw,declension,6,Wed Jun 3 20:12:38 2015 UTC,"Electronics PhD student here (RF IC designer and device fabrication)...  I think you should go for it.  When I was starting undergrad, there were multiple different disciplines that I was interested in.  In the end, I chose EE because it was the most challenging of the majors I had considered.  The thing to remember is that it's easy to switch from EE to something less competitive (business, finance, computer science) but it's much harder to move INTO EE from another major unless it's mechanical engineering or something else similar.  I can talk all day about how rewarding electrical engineering is and what my day-to-day experience is (You can PM me if you are interested in hearing about it), but it's not likely you'll take the same path as me anyway.    The takeaway is that you should set the bar high early.  You can always get started and decide it isn't for you and lower the bar a bit, but it's nearly impossible to raise it once you set it low.  Challenge yourself to your limits and you'll surprise yourself at what you can accomplish.  I'll also say that knowing how to ""apply"" math is a lot more valuable in engineering than being good at ""doing"" math.  In the real world, computers are the ones ""doing"" the math.  It is much more important to understand the big picture and discipline your mind to approach problems with a systematic and hierarchical approach."
ECE,38eqtw,ziggy_karmadust,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:08:00 2015 UTC,I agree.  I started with an engineering degree and went for a second degree (many years afterwards) in computer science.  They both work great together and the CS degree was a cake walk compared to the EE.
ECE,38eqtw,always_down_voted,12,Thu Jun 4 12:36:09 2015 UTC,"I'm an electrical engineer and I can't imagine having studied anything else. Your initial thoughts will be ""how can I apply this to anything but electricity?"" But the principals you learn as an EE are multifaceted and can be applied to almost any field of study. If you are already familiar with physics and higher level math classes EE shouldn't be too hard for you as long as you put the work in. The job prospects are vast and you are actively learning about how the world around you works. EEing can be broken down into many different areas, electronics, control systems, I love power systems and that is the area I work in. I highly suggest going for it as it will teach you to think critical, solve problems, and see the beauty in the physical processes of our world. I feel that I see the world differently than my peers because of the lessons I learned in school and I find that to be really cool and sometimes exhilarating!"

ECE,38eqtw,asuspower,2,Sat Jun 6 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"Electrical engineer here.  I work on software for UAV's in the defense industry. EE is very broad and allows you to work on everything from power systems (what most people think of) to straight programming as a developer (something people generally attribute to computer science).   If you are passionate about any of the following (Not limited to, EE is huge) EE is a fantastic choice,   Power Distribution/Generation Telecommunications Audio  Electromagnetism Analog Electronics Digital Electronics Control Systems Robotics Embedded Systems  Programming   Each one of these fields are massive and you get exposed to all of them during a traditional EE degree; though you will specialize in your last year or so.   What's fantastic about EE is that the education tends to be so broad, so you are able to experience a wide range of industries and select one you think you will enjoy. As I said, I'm working in software. This is probably a result of on the job training, as when you enter the work force the employer usually has to teach you everything you need to do the job they hired you to do. The good thing is, they understand that's how it goes so you are given a lot of options from a single degree."
ECE,38eqtw,KyleGG,2,Wed Jun 3 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"Let me provide a different perspective than many others who have posted. I really liked math and physics in high school, and pretty much selected EE on a whim. Flash forward to 2 years in, I'm having a mid-college crisis because I hated all my classes (circuit analysis, DSP, intro to C) and felt very unsure if I would even make it through or if it was right. I ended up taking a couple quarters off to go to a survival outdoors school. At the end of that, I decided economically it made the most sense for me to just finish out my BSEE and if I still hate it I can just go do something else. Fast forward to today, I am about to get my BSEE degree in 2 weeks, and I actually ended up finding a niche subject i like, solar pv. I have a job lined up and to be honest had no difficulty, even got some offers in fields i had little experience in. Long story short, EE curriculum can be incredibly tedious and difficult, but the good news is even if you don't enjoy it you're bound to a)find a job and possibly b)find one subject you want to purse. That's my 2 cents from an EE student but not really an EE by trade"
ECE,38eqtw,calpolyman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"little interesting side note: once you get into an EE department and meet your peers, you'll notice that there's kind of a split in students: those who are tinkerers and enjoy electronics projects as a hobby (real EEs), and those who are pretty much faking their way through their classes just to get a good job."
ECE,38eqtw,calpolyman,3,Thu Jun 4 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"This is rather insulting, and you should reconsider your outlook on the various types of EE people.

ECE,38eqtw,calpolyman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:55:47 2015 UTC,"I think good study habits and self discipline are the main requirements for succeeding as a EE major... granted that you have some interest in the field and you are somewhat capable in math. It's a time-intensive major, but I think it is totally worth working hard for 4-5 years for the reward afterwards. There are vast multitudes of job types you can get with a EE and a variety of lifestyles... traveling a lot, traveling a little, no travel, flexible work hours, etc etc.   I am a Power EE. I was offered the possibility to be a field guy, traveling 75% of the time and at home the rest. I declined and didn't get fired... now I travel for two days to a week at a time a few times a year to sites, and also I enjoy traveling to Europe once or twice a year for factory acceptance tests."

Can you maybe show your hand and tell us what the master and slave are? vendors + partnumbers?   Edit: the above is of course wrong. However look below for a solution. Yours is almost there, except you connected the slave to the wrong end of the resistor. The resistor must be chosen such, that MOSI can dirve MISO and SIO when both are inputs. If SIO is an output MOSI is ignored. No need to make MOSI Hi-Z that way."
ECE,38eki0,quitte,5,Wed Jun 3 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Apparently there's a 3-wire SPI interface that uses a single bi-directional data line, rather than the separate MOSI and MISO lines.  I have never seen that used. I'm curious what the supplier of the slave device recommends to drive that."

ECE,38eki0,bradn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"I just had a look with google. it's eSPI and intel has the documentation. If you loop back the masters output to its input via a resistors you'll get an echo - but you can deal with that in software. then connect SIO to the Masters input and you should be all set to start coding.  Edit: maybe need pulling up/down, too."
ECE,38eki0,quitte,2,Wed Jun 3 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"So the standard solution is a 10k resistor like I mentioned above. I'm going to try replacing the resistor with a tri-state buffer, using it like a relay. This just requires a GPIO pin to turn that on/off. I have plenty of unused GPIOs so this should work well."
ECE,38eki0,quitte,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"that should work. however the slave needs to see a one before it will switch to outputting. So I'd expect the problem to be with your ""default"" state of the output. make it high when inactive. also double check you didn't confuse miso and mosi.  The buffer is just another source of problems until you actually need it, e.g. for driving strength at high clock rates."
ECE,38eki0,quitte,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"No, the fourth wire is MOSI/MISO. On the 3-wire slave, MOSI and MISO are combined as a half-duplex data line."

ECE,38eki0,kingofthejaffacakes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"You could connect your MOSI to the gate of a FET that pulls down the MISO which has a pull-up resistor.

Maybe (a typical alkaline AA-size battery datasheet) would be worth studying.  I like (this graph) the most.  To me, this graph says that electronic equipment which stops working when the battery voltage falls to 1.4V, is very badly designed.  Malpractice-level bad design."

And since they don't extend down to 0.6 V, it's more difficult to predict what sort of improvement this product can provide - but it's less than 2x if that's the use case."
ECE,3893gy,dietlein,9,Tue Jun 2 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"If you could really get a large battery life increase by running batteries down to 0.6 V, then a lot of products would be designed to do that.  You don't generally see alkaline discharge curves that go down that low, but that's because there isn't much point to it. Every battery technology I have seen ramps down to a certain voltage, and drops rather abruptly below that. Alkaline cells seem to do that, and it happens around 0.8 V."

I read about boost converters in the past, but I've only built a very rudimentary (no feedback loop) one in LTspice. IIRC, they allow for a greater output voltage at the expense of drawing more current from the source. Bob does acknowledge that this is not a breakthrough. What he did do however, was to package that circuit into an extremely thin integrated circuit you can just wrap around a battery and call it a day, which is clever IMO.  With that being said, I'm not completely sure about the claimed 800% gains, but I'd say it really depends on many other variables like the commenters here pointed out."

My first ""internships"" were with mechanical/electrical contractors and through I've only occasionally have used that knowledge, it was indeed far more valuable than ""flipping burgers"".  These jobs entailed reading blueprints, identifying every component on the drawing, figuring out 3 vendors from whom we could get the component, calling the vendors to get price and delivery, tabulating it all into a list and presenting that to my boss.  Not necessarily exciting but I learned a lot (I learned what a ""clevis hanger"" and ""dry standpipe"" are).

A quick Google search found this thread on Tom's Hardware.   Semi-conductors, as a general rule, gain or lose half their life for every 10C of operation.   Again this is only a general rule because you are not going to have 1/32 of the chips lifetime left if you bump the top temp up by 50C. You'll probably cook it immediately and have 0 life left.    As for bitcoin mining, the forums you were reading are probably a couple years old because mining with CPUs or GPUs is not economically feasible unless you have pretty much no operating costs (e.g. botnets). Not to discourage anyone from mining bitcoin, as I have been doing it for a while, but bitcoin mining with a CPU/GPU I think is a fun way to first get involved with it, just as long as you understand that, with almost complete certainty, you will not make any money."

ECE,38abnp,jk0011,0,Tue Jun 2 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"Oftentimes bitcoin mining involves the overclocking of hardware. Overclocking raises the operating temperature of the chip.  So to reiterate, by running the CPU/GPU at 100%, each additional 10 degrees of heat added, as a result of overclocking, will cut the life of the chip down in half.   Higher temperatures lower the resistances of components, leading to higher leakage currents, possibly damaging parts of the circuit.  In addition, what ever the transistors are doped with could end up drifting away from where it is supposed to be, causing more problems.  The above things, along with many other factors can result in electrons tunneling through transistors, resulting in an error or unintended output. In other words, a chip that gets too hot will break at a small, transistor-level. This can lead to other logic blocks failing and then the entire chip dying. That being said, almost every CPU/GPU has at least some fault (i.e. a discrepancy between the circuit design and the actual chip) but most are minor that cause nothing to worry about."

My wife's laptop has an i5 and it would often force shutdown if it ran too hot for too long.  All that said, let's back up a moment and realize that FPGA and ASICs have completely run the idea of a CPU/GPU being used for bitcoins into the ground. You spend way more on power than you'll get back in money.  Now if you're doing it purely for academics though, go right ahead! But a PC is not going to break even for bitcoins."

Lean also takes into account waste created through overburden (""Muri"") and waste created through unevenness in work loads (""Mura""). Working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service, ""value"" is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.  Essentially, lean is centered on making obvious what adds value by reducing everything else. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as ""lean"" only in the 1990s.   TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota, from a small company to the world's largest automaker,   has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.

In other words, break down the overall design into smaller and smaller units, until at the bottom are units with only a single requirement, linking upward to the overall project at the top. Then its just a matter of completing each requirement one-by-one to complete the design. Granted this is difficult without much experience, as it can be difficult to identify what the requirements are.  Following this is a Waterfall type flow. You design what the hardware should do, write out the actual implementation, simulate the code or schematic, then test the physical circuit, and repeat when you have errors until you have a working product."

Honestly things have gone far beyond analog or digital - Apple's Garage Band is probably the shining example of where things are.   Synthesizers for music have always been a bit of a niche market anyway.  Music or even just audio are markets but not for the US: most audio of any type is designed and manufactured in Asia.  The US abdicated ALL of that in the 1970s and 1980s.  Consumer electronics and most profession audio electronics has been gone from the US stage for that long (basically it was already gone when I graduated with my EE degree in '84).  There are lots of other areas where analog thrives, however.  It's hard to describe how many areas these are but they are more commonly ""industrial"" and ""military"" which have higher profit margins than consumer goods anyway and have incentives for hiring ""expensive"" EE talent.  These are the areas where analog still thrives.   One possible trick to see which industries specifically is to look at the markets that analog IC vendors target.  Just browse the applications that Analog Device or Linear Technology are designing chips for: those are hot enough to get their attentions.  Look at who their customers are: they are applying these chips to applications that are hot enough to get their attentions as well.     Another source: look at trade magazines like EDN: these are based on the premise they can make free subscriptions available because the money involved in the subjects they are talking about are that profitable for advertisers to pay them for advertising instead of demanding payment from readers!

If you want something that involves music or audio, most of the jobs in this country would likely involve DSP-type stuff.

So the voltage provided by the source is 'sunk' into each resistor in proportion to it's resistance value."
ECE,380k71,khaddy,4,Mon Jun 1 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"First off, beware about your assumption at the end. Even if the resistors are in series, when you draw it out on paper, there's nothing stopping you (or a text book, or a test) from labeling each component with it's own designators (e.g. R1, Ir1, Vr1, or whatever shorthand or naming conventions they choose to use). In this case, I2 would = I1, and that would be part of your answer.   BUT ... the most important thing is, to just state your assumption clearly, and proceed from there. If you really have doubts, solve both circuits (second one on the back), and leave a short note. It'll show them you know what you're doing, provide extra practice, and point out to them that their question is ambiguous and confusing :)  So once you state your assumption, you proceed from there.

Since they have listed that the voltage drop across R2 is 100V, it implies that the circuit cannot actually be collected in simple parallel .. because you would have the full 240 volts drop across the resistance.   d) Ignoring c), R3 with 210 Ohms would have a current of 1.1428 Amps.

In order to determine the voltage drop, you have to first understand what the downstream circuit is doing.   Think of it this way: You know the voltage source is 240V, and the first resistance still allows a current of 200mA. If this was the only resistor in the circuit, the whole 240V would drop over this resistor, and this would imply V=IR that R = 1200 Ohms.  Now, imagine the same circuit, with a unknown black box circuit added downstream. If this black box has Rbb = 100 Ohms, and you KNOW that R1 (and hence the whole circuit) is still passing 200mA, this implies the total resistance that the source sees has not changed, and that R1 must now be 1100 Ohms. Total resistance is still 1200 Ohms, so circuit current remains at 200mA. In this imagined circuit, The voltage drop across R1 is the ratio of it's resistance over the entire circuit resistance, or 1100 / 1200, multiplied by 240V... so 220V would be dissipated over R1, and 20V over R2.  Now imagine the same black box circuit but this time, the black box resistance is 1100 Ohms. By the same logic as above, this would imply R1 is only 100 Ohms. Total circuit resistance still 1200 Ohms, allows a current of 200mA.  This time, the Voltage dropped over R1 is only 20V, and over R2 is 220 V.   So you see? To understand how much voltage is dissipated by a component, you must determine how much current is going through it, and how much resistance is has. To do that, you have to solve the whole series circuit."

This can be a timed relay with a direct connection to the optocoupler, or a timer circuit (555 or perhaps just an RC network) controlling a FET that controls its supply connection.  This method just gives the supply time to stabilize but doesn't verify it.    The latter uses an IC called a supply voltage supervisor, commonly used with MCUs to hold them in reset until the supply stabilizes.  There are many types.  You could use them to control a FET or maybe find one that has a built-in driver.    Some MCUs have complicated power-up sequencing requirements between their I/O and core supplies.  If the voltage differs too much during power-up they can be damaged.  These require specialized power supply controllers."

ECE,37ni1i,aerovistae,22,Thu May 28 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"Charge comes in two flavors in a semiconductor: fixed and mobile.  The total net charge is zero but the mobile or fixed net charge may not be.  In an n-type dopant atom, it has an extra valence electron, but this electron is balanced by an extra proton in the nucleus.  That proton does not move as it is stuck in the nucleus which is stuck in the crystal lattice, so it is called fixed charge.  When the extra valence electron is ionized into the conduction band it leaves behind a fixed positive charge in the nucleus, so total charge is conserved.    The electron may move somewhere else but charge is conserved so the semiconductor will remain charge neutral."
ECE,37ni1i,mattskee,4,Thu May 28 23:20:10 2015 UTC,"And getting into the nitty gritty, if the semiconductor has a static charge on it, there are more protons than electrons or vice versa, but a small amount, and it tends to balance in a way that it has no real effect inside the semiconductor.  Like, a chip with its supply rails at 0V, 5V will behave the same as one with its rails at 100V, 105V, but there is a little fewer electrons inside the part floating at 100V.  This isn't important at all in understanding the semiconductor behavior though, but I consider omitting it to be one of those things that can hinder total understanding if you assume it to not be the case."
ECE,37ni1i,bradn,3,Fri May 29 04:39:55 2015 UTC,"That's true, the ""system"" is always charge neutral for the correct definition of ""system"".  What you're describing is the field effect, same as in MOSFETs.  In a MOSFET the charge neutrality includes the metal gate which is insulated from the semiconductor.   If you float a semiconductor to a high voltage and have stray capacitances to other nodes which are at a significantly different voltage you can have unintentional gating of the semiconductor.  In practical cases this is generally quite insignificant because these stray capacitances are extremely small."
ECE,37ni1i,mattskee,1 point,Fri May 29 05:02:58 2015 UTC,thanks! also see my additional question under the top comment here; i'm making progress but still not totally clear
ECE,37ni1i,Cheeseducksg,1 point,Fri May 29 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so addendum to original question then. I understand now why the semiconductor is electrically neutral. What I still do not understand is how a PN junction facilitates or hinders flow of current. The depletion zone thing is still not making sense to me.  I mean, if you put a p-type semiconductor against an n-type semiconductor, forming a PN-junction, wouldn't all the extra electrons from the n-type want to flow into all the holes in the p-type, forming two charged ends?  Thank you for your help in understanding this, by the way, I appreciate it."
ECE,37ni1i,mattskee,2,Fri May 29 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Near the middle of the junction, electrons from the n type and the holes from the p type join together.  This leaves the p type with fewer holes than it would like, so it becomes positively charged near the junction. Likewise, the n type has fewer electrons than it would like, leaving it negatively charged near the junction.  Overall, the diode is still charge neutral. But near the center you've got those regions with charge.  At the far end of the n type, there are still free electrons. The n type's positively charged region is pulling on them, but the p type's negatively charged regions is pushing them away. At this point you've got stability.  If you add a forward bias voltage to the ends of the diode, it pushes free electrons into the n type's positively charged region. Doing so decreases the amount of positive charge, which allows electrons to be pulled off the end of the p type.  However, if you add a reverse bias voltage, you are trying to pull electrons off the end of the n type, which is hard because the n type has the positively charged region near the junction. To get the diode to let current through in the reverse bias, you have to push electrons through the negatively charged region of the p type, and that's not easy to do.   Unless you've got a zener diode, the reverse breakdown voltage is much higher than the forward turn in voltage. This allows us to model diodes as one-way current gates. In reality, the current flows both ways as a function of voltage. But in one direction you only need a little voltage to get going, in the other directing you need a ton of voltage."
ECE,37ni1i,jubjub7,1 point,Sat May 30 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"wouldn't all the extra electrons from the n-type want to flow into all the holes in the p-type, forming two charged ends?   Some of the electrons flow from n-side to p-side and some of the holes flow in the opposite direction from p-side to n-side.  But the process eventually limits itself and stops and you are left with a depletion region and a barrier.  If you imagine a piece of p-type and n-type semiconductor are joined together at t=0, you can see that there is a concentration gradient for holes and electrons (i.e. more electrons on one side, more holes on the other side), so diffusion naturally occurs to spread out the electrons and holes so you get a net flow from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.  When an electron flows from n-side to p-side eventually it will recombine with a hole, because on the p-side an electron is a minority carrier, and when there are so many opportunities to recombine it will do so quickly.  The same thing happens to a hole flowing to the n-side.    When the electron left the n-side for the p-side it left behind positive fixed charge from the dopant atom.  When the hole leaves the p-side for the n-side it leaves behind negative fixed charge.  These two volumes of charge create an electric field.  When you have an electric field, you have a drift current.  The drift current opposes the diffusion current that was initially taking place.  You can see that electric field must oppose the diffusion because electrons leaving the n-type side leaves positive charge behind, and electrons are attracted to positive charge, so it tries to pull the electrons back.   The more electrons and holes that flowed to the other side and recombined, the greater the electric field becomes that opposes the diffusion.  Eventually you reach an equilibrium and the two balance out.  It turns out that while it is not completely true, the state that the system reaches can be very closely described with the ""depletion region approximation"" where you treat a region around the junction as empty of mobile charge, and the region beyond that filled with the normal concentration as described by the doping level.  This works well enough because the mobile carrier concentration is changing exponentially in the depletion region so it rapidly gets small enough that it is negligible compared to the fixed charge.  PS - if you are still having trouble understanding diffusion, imagine putting a pile of glitter on the middle of your floor and releasing a bunch of energetic puppies into the room.  The puppies move about randomly and quickly.  They will track the glitter about in random directions, sometimes they track it away from the pile, and sometimes back into the pile.  But on average the glitter moves from areas of high concentration to low concentration, because the puppies are more likely to pick up the glitter when they are standing in an area of high glitter concentration.  So eventually the glitter will be spread out more or less uniformly across your floor."
ECE,37ni1i,Cheeseducksg,3,Sat May 30 00:30:00 2015 UTC,All of the atoms in both n-type and p-type semiconductors have the same number of protons and electrons.  That's what makes them electrically neutral.
ECE,37ni1i,bradn,3,Fri May 29 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"Silicon is electrically neutral; it has the same number of electrons as it has protons.  The elements you use to dope it are also electrically neutral; they have the same number of electrons as they have neutral.  The difference is that silicon's crystal structure is really stable. Since there are four electrons and four holes available for bonding, when you have pure silicon every hole is filled, and every electron is used to fill a hole.  When you add something that has 3 electrons and 5 holes, the silicon bonds with the three electrons, and fills four of the holes. Thus you get 'free' holes.  When you add something that has 5 electrons and 3 holes available for bonding, the silicon uses 4 of the electrons, and fills three of the holes. Thus you get 'free' electrons.  In both cases, though, you are adding electrically neutral doping elements to electrically neutral silicon. The total number of protons and electrons are still equal."

Adding a bit of phosphorus doesn't add electrons, instead it makes existing electrons mobile.  We end up with positive phosphorus ions and mobile electrons, since those electrons wandered away from the neutral K atoms.  For each positive K ion in there, a mobile electron is nearby.  Unfortunately, most texts describe this as ""adding free electrons.""  I think you could just inject positive phosphorus ions into pure Si, and the material would suck electrons out of the environment, to avoid becoming positively charged to Megavolts."

The MSP430 is good, but stepping up to one of their ARM boards will probably give better experience since many manufacturers make ARM chips. I'm playing with one right now (I did arduino > AVR > ARM) and it's great! The power in the things is incredible.   I'm writing some tutorials on how to get up and running with the TI ARM launchpad, anyone feel free to comment/PM if you'd like a link.  I will say though, playing around with bare AVR devices also gave me a good understanding of bitwise operations and registers, which has helped immensely with the 32 bit ARM devices. So AVRs would also be good (or PICs or anything else too)."

ECE,37nhse,mantrap2,3,Fri May 29 01:20:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Arduino board has a single chip microcontroller. Those other parts are just power and the USB interface. It's a perfectly good board.  What's special about an Arduino is the development software and bootloader, which you can discard, if you want to. There are numerous ways to develop code for the Atmel AVR series. For starters, you should go to Atmel and see what they suggest.  If you want to try other brands of processors, they each have similar support from their manufacturers, and from third party vendors. The drill is about the same: you get a board, development software (either free from the manufacturer or purchased), and you get the programming hardware to program the part.  There is lots of information about this on the web. It's not going to be quite as easy as Arduino, because there isn't such a large community for any particular processor."
ECE,37nhse,1wiseguy,1 point,Thu May 28 23:38:41 2015 UTC,So I can use the same arduino board but program it as if it was the barebones chip?
ECE,37nhse,1wiseguy,3,Fri May 29 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yep. The only thing that makes the MCU on an Arduino board special is the bootloader program that is pre-installed. You can overwrite that when you program it, but then it won't run as an Arduino anymore.  An Arduino also has a USB interface that is normally used for programming. That only works with a bootloader program installed on the MCU, but you can use that circuit to communicate with the PC.  I have never done this, but there is a lot of information available."
ECE,37nhse,playaspec,1 point,Fri May 29 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, have you learned to take the AVR to its limit? I would suggest if you aren't familiar with accessing the hardware directly, writing drivers for hardware, writing ISRs and optimizing code in assembly, then you're going to find the learning curve is much steeper  moving to a 32-bit microcontroller.   If you have, I'm particularly fond of Freescale K20 line. It's the same microcontroller used in the Teensy 3.0, 3.1, and McHck. I still find the AVR line far easier for the work I do. If you've reached the performance limit of the Atmega line, the Xmega line has way better peripherals, a faster clock, and more memory."

ECE,37ikxy,jurniss,6,Thu May 28 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"Good start! Digital signal processing is definitely useful.

An M.S. will almost certainly increase your pay and may open up new opportunities depending on what your specialty/field is.  IMO a double major is almost never worth it from a purely financial/time perspective."

I think I believe you and the head of my department more, since he dual majored in EE and CE and regretted it, but it is hard to be sure sometimes!"
ECE,37ioze,bradn,4,Thu May 28 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"A dual major there might be useful if you intend to work with board design & firmware where the two kinda tie together, but pretty often having a major and solid skills in one or the other is a good enough stepping stone to learning what you need from the other one.  There's so much free info on the internet now that if you can't learn something you need, it's probably just because you didn't try.  In my experience, having some CE and CS education (and a useless CIS major), maybe 20% of the stuff I use on a day to day basis came from classes, and the other 80% is just from experience and google searching and playing with stuff.  There's so much you can learn just by looking through /r/AskElectronics and /r/ECE threads by looking at a problem someone posts, and checking which of the suggested solutions make sense, or doing your own research to find the answer.  The thing to keep in mind, is that many of those questions have a basis in practicality, so you build useful skills really quickly."
ECE,37ioze,Wee2mo,2,Thu May 28 01:11:22 2015 UTC,I would go with your advisor. Your degree only really matters for the first job or two. You would get more value out of working on projects that apply what you have learned than extra course work. Especially if you know what you enjoy doing.
ECE,37ioze,Hurricane043,9,Thu May 28 04:25:04 2015 UTC,"As an EE/CE dual major, I have to say it's pretty useless. In the end, you are likely going to focus on an area that is either EE or CE. I can't really think of a position in the industry where you would be performing a distinct EE and CE job at the same time. Of course, you may plan on switching careers at some point, in which the double major may help.  An EE/CS major can be useful. However, again, you are going to be either doing an EE job, a CS job, or a combination EE/CS job, which is probably a CE job anyway.   Personally, I would recommend picking one and doing the Master's in whatever you decide interests you the most when you finish your undergrad. With a undergrad in EE, CE, or CS, you can easily do a Master's in any of the three."
ECE,37ioze,4G_Kush,2,Thu May 28 00:50:11 2015 UTC,What about embedded programming? A software engineer who has solid understanding of electronics is always a huge plus

I realize some schools may put more emphasis on different areas with CE, but a CE should have a good fundamental understanding of electronics and software development.   I do agree that is probably the main area in which it may be useful though."
ECE,37ioze,psycoee,-2,Thu May 28 02:04:48 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a CompE program that had anywhere near the depth of an EE+CS dual major.  At many schools, a CompE is an EE program with a couple of C programming classes and maybe the first algorithms class and a couple of CS electives (that many people wasted on easy, useless classes).  Many such programs don't require things like automata, parsers, compilers, operating systems, or databases.  And these are not things you are likely to ever learn on the job, so you'll be a crappier programmer for a very long time."
ECE,37ioze,Hurricane043,2,Thu May 28 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are arguing here. My point was that if you do an EE/CS dual major, you are going to end up in a career that is either strictly EE or CS, or a CE career. Automata, parsers, OS, etc., are all CS careers, not EE careers, so my point holds true. You're correct that an EE/CS dual degree will have more depth than a CE degree, but I never said it wouldn't.  With that said, while I can't speak for every CE program in the country, my program covered all of those topics except automata in depth."
ECE,37ioze,psycoee,0,Thu May 28 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"My point was that EE+CS is not equivalent to CE.  It has significantly more depth, and people with such qualifications are more sought after.  Particularly for embedded software people, I'd hire a EE/CS dual major any day of the week over someone with just a CE degree.  Usually, they know a lot more about both hardware and software.  I don't know about your school, but CE generally compromises either the CS or the EE components (or both), because there are simply not enough hours in a normal 4-year curriculum to cover everything.  Doing both usually requires ~150 hours, so that's 6 extra electives compared to a CE degree.  For example, one incredibly important and useful class that's often not required for CE majors is electromagnetics."

ECE,37ioze,morto00x,6,Thu May 28 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"Before going into more details, does your university even allow double majoring in EE and CpE? A lot of places won't."
ECE,37ioze,gimpwiz,2,Thu May 28 00:52:37 2015 UTC,"My school has begun separating the two more now, however, I started in the last year of the old curriculum in which EE and CE share more classes and can finish in that curriculum."
ECE,37ioze,gimpwiz,3,Thu May 28 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on the needs...  I did a dual EE/CE major (lots of overlap), and got minors in CS and math (again, thanks to overlap, it required only 5 extra courses to get both.)  EE/CE is a no-brainer if it's a dual major and you can fit the extra courses. As a double major (the distinction being how much overlap there is and how your university treats it) may or may not make sense.  CE/CS is potentially an interesting combination, but I think it depends on how much time it takes you. Can you fit it into your standard university course-load without spending extra time and money? Then go for it. CE teaches you the theory and implementation of computers, CS teaches you the theory and implementation of... well, computers, but from a different perspective; and hopefully you learn to program at some point in between the two. The reason it may not be useful is because every CE should understand some CS and learn to program; and every CS should understand some CE and learn to program; so it may well be better served with a BS+MS than dual BS. If you can do it in a single course load, though, go for it.  EE/CS is nifty because it shows that you don't just understand computers from hardware and software, it shows that you understand electronics and hardware and software and heavily implies that you're a CE person.  With all that said, the jobs that are a mix of hardware and software will often hire people with any of EE, CE, or CS. They may like you more if you have some dual major but it's not a big deal.  Now, the MS question... depends on what you want to do. In many fields, an MS pays off financially - some more, some less. In other fields, it's less about money and more about open doors. I know from hard experience that in chip design, in places like implementation but especially architecture, many people don't give a shit about your experience, you're not getting your foot in the door without a graduate degree. Money may follow."

ECE,37ioze,IronChefFlay,1 point,Thu May 28 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"The degree I would do is coursework only, basically you take approximately another year to keep studying, and you need a certain GPA to do it, which is a little less than if you were defending a thesis."
ECE,37ioze,psycoee,2,Thu May 28 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"The vast majority don't care.  You'll get the occasional question of ""what was your thesis"" but they just move on when you say you didn't do one."

If a company does NOT need the combination, it won't be helpful  Most companies have HR rules on BS vs. MS degrees and pay curves which usually apply most when being hired without experience  Most companies leave a fair amount of discretion to the manager to select the right pay curve and pay level for a particular employee - experience can be made to trump most HR policies with the right level of signature and manager commitment"
ECE,37ioze,sporkpdx,2,Wed May 27 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"EE/CE dual with CS masters here.  Was the dual major important for me?  Probably not, but it gave me an excuse to take more of the kinds of classes that I liked, and allowed me to cherrypick more projects to show off to employers.  Was the masters important?  Oh yeah.  Definite pay bump, and the CS knowledge really opened a lot of doors.  There's a ton of mixed software work out there, and if you're with a small company you can change hats between hardware and software as needed.  If you like software (mixed with your hardware), then I definitely would recommend pairing the CS with your EE in some way. Whether that is via a masters or a dual major is up to you.   I will note that if you don't do a CE or CS track during your undergrad though, you may be ill prepared to take on a CS masters."

The explanations are pretty solid and you can find the solutions manual online.   If you want a hardcopy, just buy an older edition of the book for like $15. It won't be any different to the newer overpriced editions."
ECE,37d97h,3rdNipp1e,2,Tue May 26 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Have you tried Schaum's Outlines for Electronic Devices and Circuits? They go over the main concepts and theory and provide plenty of examples as well as lots of practice problems with full solutions.
ECE,37d97h,madscientistEE,2,Tue May 26 22:25:55 2015 UTC,Lessons In Electric Circuits is wonderful if a bit of a work in progress.   The fundamentals are complete however.

Multisim is what I use for circuit analysis, but LT-Spice is free, and you probably will be using a spice program of somesort. That will pretty much let you know if you got your answer right by replicating your circuit in the program and checking the outcome. I used to use circuitlab, but it's not free anymore."
ECE,37dyp6,elgseter,2,Tue May 26 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Oooo i love transistors! One of my favorite components haha. In fact for my senior design i made a transistor curve tracer. Transistors are great little devices that can be used for many things (as you're probably aware). So the question is, which application do you wish to know more about? Amplifiers? Digital ICs? Electronic switches? Current sources? There are of course many more applications, but I think its good to have a starting point to start looking."
ECE,37dyp6,kuatsimoto,1 point,Tue May 26 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"I know, right? It's baffling what they can do! Wow, I would love to see that curve tracer.

We've covered current mirrors and the sorts, but I dont see how learning more about them, will help me understand the transistor. Something tells me switching and amplifying will."
ECE,37dyp6,kuatsimoto,1 point,Wed May 27 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"Alrighty then! Electronic switches are easy. You are basically trying to turn the transistor on so that there is little to no voltage drop across Vds/Vce. Amplifiers though are a bit harder. Get ready to do some math!

It's a classic text that is written in more of a conversational tone than  most text books. This should make it a  bit more palatable for your summer reading.
ECE,37dqj2,JConsequence,3,Tue May 26 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"I recently graduated with a BSEE in NorCal, and from my recent job search experience I'd say pretty important. If the internships are relevant to the job you want, it gives you something concrete to talk about in interviews, gives you some employment history, and builds your connections. An internship can lead to a full-time position or (in my case) provide good references for when you apply elsewhere. It also helps you explore what you'd like to do for a career.   That's not to say that you won't be competitive if you don't have an internship or two, but you'll have to make up for it elsewhere.   My advice:  I'd still recommend you keep searching for a relevant internship. Side projects are good but only get you so far compared to your peers with proven internship experience. Perhaps delay your graduation by a semester and do a co-op, if possible. Going to career fairs is in my opinion the best way to get an internship, and be open to relocation. I found my internship experiences to be invaluable and one of the main reasons I lined up a great job before graduation.   Even any technical work experience is good. My first internship was software-related (and I'm more of a circuits guy) but I still learned a lot and it gave me something to talk about.   Honestly if your goal is to only find a full time job then you can ignore me, but I think your goal should be to find a meaningful, rewarding first job that will set you up for success in the rest of your career."
ECE,37dqj2,Sli0,3,Tue May 26 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"They're extremely valuable, and in many cases they can get you a guaranteed job upon graduation.  Companies often view them as ""extended interviews""."
ECE,37dqj2,cpudesignguy,2,Wed May 27 03:21:56 2015 UTC,Rather important. Apply to more. Work with your school's career counseling or whatever.

If you want to be competitive in the entry level job market you ABSOLUTELY NEED something that will set you apart from the rest of the candidates.  Internships are awesome because they provide you with real world experience, the ability to make contacts in the industry, and a 'foot in the door' with a company.  Other options you can pursue are taking on personal projects, volunteer work, or freelance work, which can provide you with skills and experience that you may put on your job application. Talk to your professors.  They usually have a lot of contacts in local industry through their current research and past work.  Also, if possible, be willing to move for the summer for an internship, it'll be worth your while.  EDIT:  Also, make sure to get your resume critiqued by your university career center, as well as your professors.  Many engineering professors were in hiring positions in the past, and they will provide you with valuable insight as to how to properly structure your resumes and coverletters  to get noticed."
ECE,3794zs,FumpleThumb,6,Mon May 25 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of work in wet industrial and marine environments, and here are some hints:   Cable glands, liquid tight nm fittings, and the can work, but you need to be very diligent about your surfaces, o-rings, threads, thread dope, etc.    Use a high quality Teflon o-ring grease.   Be prepared to replace every o-ring every time you disassemble something that uses one.   Don't assume things are properly assembled at the factory. Dry, damaged o-rings are the norm.   Use high quality pipe dope. And Teflon tape if it has really coarse threads.   Marine anti-sieze is also your friend for anything you will want to take apart later.   Potting epoxy is your friend. Use it everywhere you can. Regular epoxys are a poor substitute.   Packing pin type connectors with dielectric grease is sometimes indicated.   Everything needs a seal, gasket of o-ring. If it doesn't have one (or more) it's not for you.   They make cable gland nuts  with included sealing rings.   Everything must be stainless steel or non-metallic.  Generally IP67 stuff is the best you will find. It's expensive. Floating on the surface it will probably be enough."

There are also MIL-STD-108 enclosures which are waterproof.  TL;DR: when it comes to extreme environments, DOD has usually solved the problem already and created a supply chain."
ECE,3794zs,maximusismax,2,Mon May 25 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions.  Unfortunately those existing enclosures (like another suggestion) are not shaped the way I would like. I was hoping to model the enclosure myself and have it 3D printed.  Also the MIL-DTL-22992 connectors are large and expensive. I couldn't find any connectors <$100/unit. My application is nowhere near saftey critical, so I was hoping I could find something within the $10-$15 range. Also the PCB is probably going to be around the size of a deck or cards, so I was hoping to find connectors that were relatively small.  Thank again."
ECE,3794zs,spyguy99,4,Mon May 25 22:34:57 2015 UTC,IP Rating is the international standard for this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code  So you could buy an IP rated container. Or look into existing designs and make your own. I 3D printed a IP65 case recently. But it sounds like you need at least IP67.
ECE,3794zs,nachofrand,2,Mon May 25 22:16:11 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. The cable gland I linked to above is rated IP68.  I have been looking for IP68 because although my application ""shouldn't"" be submerged more than 1M, I could definitely see that happening in some cases. Plus it seems like the cost difference from IP67 to IP68 is small and a little extra margin never hurt nobody.  To your point about existing enclosures, I'm not sure this will suffice for a couple of reasons. One is that I am doing this myself to avoid the engineering labor costs. I'm a CE (although an inexperienced one), so I'm thinking I can power through the project myself while picking up a few valuable skills. The other reason is that I've looked briefly and found mostly rectangular enclosures. I was envisioning a floating buoy-type enclosure to make sure it floats upright in the water.  Thanks for your input!"
ECE,3794zs,aghl,2,Mon May 25 22:25:46 2015 UTC,Check Binder USA. They have connectors rated IP68. I've used them a bunch for an underwater ROV and they're great. Look at series 713 and 763.

ECE,378ov3,nat45928,7,Mon May 25 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Note: I'm not an EMC expert.  I've found this to be an excellent resource: http://www.learnemc.com/EMC-Tutorials.html  You've already identified your source of noise, now you need to identify the coupling path: conducted coupling (shared impedance), magnetic coupling (transformer coupling), capacitive coupling, or radiated coupling (antenna).  Conducted noise will occur if you have noisy currents flowing through the same conductor as your clean currents. Somehow return (aka ground) currents are often overlooked. Some engineers tend to route power carefully, being careful to separate noisy and clean voltage rails, but then route ground without any thought.  Magnetic coupling occurs if you have a loop inducing voltages on another loop (think of how a transformer work). For this to occur you need two loops, and at least one of them with a changing current (voltage is only induced by changing flux, not constant flux). The large amounts of changing magnetic flux caused by your motor windings should come to mind.  Capacitive coupling occurs if you have nearby surfaces. Think of the way a capacitor works. A changing voltage on one surface will cause a voltage coupled to the other surface.  Radiated coupling will occur when you have an antenna producing noise and an antenna to receive the noise. Unless you're dealing with high frequencies, cables are usually the only effective antennas in a system. Think of a dipole antenna. If you have two long conductors coming out of a box in opposite directions, if there is a voltage difference across them, you will have radiation. Routing the cables close together will make it look less like a dipole (with the risk of creating capacitive coupling).  Hope that helps."
ECE,378ov3,toohyetoreply,3,Mon May 25 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"Henry Ott has a couple good books on the topic.  I have ""Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems"" which as I recall covers more of grounding and shielding for noise reduction, and I do not have ""Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering"" which sounds to me like it would be useful for your problem.  Also you could look up MIL-STD-461 which covers testing and performance verification for passing EMC testing.  This is such a huge topic that I can't give you enough information to answer your question.  Worse, passing EMC can depend on the tiniest things.  A surprising amount has to do with ground locations and enclosure design.  Shielding and filtering do a lot of the rest.  And as near as I can tell a tiny amount of black magic may be required to push a peak enough below a limit to pass EMC."

There should not be any DC conduction across the terminals; piezo devices look pretty much just like a capacitor.  You should be able to just connect it directly to a function generator and drive it with a square or sine wave at the maximum amplitude your instrument can put out (these can withstand several tens of volts of amplitude before they break).  I doubt you can sweep it across any significant range.  Usually, these are fairly high Q (peaky) and only have a bandwidth of ~ 1 kHz.  You'd have to sweep the frequency and measure the AC current to figure out what the resonant frequency is (probably 40 kHz).  Or just give it a voltage step and measure the frequency of the ringing with a scope."

Because the shunt capacitance is huge, you are not likely to damage anything.  I don't think you want to use any kind of linear amplifier to drive the thing.  Most amplifiers are not going to be happy driving a huge capacitance, and it's just not necessary.

ECE,371434,Fencepost,1 point,Sun May 24 10:07:34 2015 UTC,"The answer is going to depend heavily on where you're sensing for control feedback. Think about it this way: magnetizing inductance is what you want for the ""transformeryness"" leakage inductance is distributed series inductance in the way. Leakage inductance can be problematic by adding phase lag to your control loop. That said, some types of controllers/topologies can benefit from some leakage. Tl;dr minimize leakage, you can always add intentional leakage if you want it."
ECE,371434,RazorEE,3,Sun May 24 17:12:43 2015 UTC,Measuring primary side inductance with the secondary open circuit gives you total inductance. Measuring primary side inductance with the secondary shorted gives you leakage inductance.
ECE,371434,petemate,2,Sun May 24 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"Good question. Here are my two cents regarding the question of how to calculate aceptable magnetizing and leakage inductance.   Your magnetizing inductance is what the transformer actually ""uses"", so to say, to build the magnetization. I would argue that you, in principle, would want the magnetizing inductance to be as big as possible, because it would mean that the transformer is as ideal as possible. Remember, in the transformer model, the magnetizing inductance is basically an inductor in parallel with an ideal transformer. So, you would want that to appear as big as possible to approach an open-circuit condition. But just winding a gazilion turns to get high primary-side(magnetizing inductance) will result in high flux, so there is a practical limit. Remember that the flux in a transformer is constant because it is only set by the magnetizing inductance(and leakage, I guess). An ideal transformer has no net magnetization, because the two sides cancel out. So, very large magnetizing inductance, but within reason for the core you have chosen.  Keep also in mind that there are topologies for which it is necessary to have a specific inductance. For instance, in a flyback transformer, which basically functions as a two-terminal(or 4-terminal, depending on your definitions) inductor, the magnetizing inductance is what provides the inductor-effect. You basically dump energy into the magnetizing inductance and then pass that energy through the secondary winding, to the output.   Regarding leakage inductance: Leakage inductance is the inductance that is present because there is not perfect coupling between the primary and secondary sides. It is the flux that does not couple that acts as a leakage inductance. This is modeled by an inductor in series with the transformer(which is still in parallel with the magnetizing inductance). So, the leakage inductance is unwanted because it doesnt do anything useful(typically, se below). So you would want that to be as small as possible. In flybacks, you would want it to be small enough not to add any significant inductance to the value of the magnetizing inductance. Remember, when the secondary side is disconnected, the primary side is just the magnetizing inductance. If you then have your leakage inductance as an inductor in series, you basically just have a larger equivalent inductance. The criteria would then be that the total inductance is within the specification that your converter is designed to work with - e.g. 10% tolerance(though its usually larger for transformers because of tolerances in manufacturing). You can however use leakage inductance for useful things. It can for instance be used to limit power through a transformer, just like a normal inductor in front of any other circuit."
ECE,371434,petemate,1 point,Mon May 25 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"This was a great read, thanks.   One thing though, with magnetizing inductance, as my input voltage is a square wave that will make the input current a triangle wave. Doesn't the magnetizing inductance limit the peak current, and therefore the primary current?"
ECE,371434,ElecEng66,2,Mon May 25 08:34:42 2015 UTC,"You got it. Sometimes its good to write and explain things in order to check that you understand it correctly.  The magnetizing inductance will limit the magnetizing current, but not the primary-side current. Again, the magnetizing inductance is just an inductor across the primary side of an ideal transformer. The current through the magnetizing inductor will depend on the usual prameters of the inductor. But the ideal transformer just transfers power ideally, which is just by the Ppri=Psec or n1/n2=v1/v2 equation. Thus, the current going into the leg of the transformer is really Im+Ip, where Im then branches to the magnetizing inductance and Ip goes to the ideal transformer, to transfer power to the secondary side. This also explains why the transformer still uses some current, even if there is nothing connected to the secondary side. Its the current in the magnetizing inductance. The magnetizing current will stay relatively constant, independent of how much load you put on the secondary side. You may then ask about the size of the transformer. As long as you make the magnetizing inductance really high and the leakage really low, you technically don't need to care about the transformer size in relation to the power transfered from secondary to primary. Size is theoretically independent of power capability. In practice, however, there are resistive losses in the copper which requires a larger core window to wind the core. There are also other effects, such as the proximity effect and the skin effect, that affects the power dissipated and thus the actual size of the core."
ECE,371434,fatangaboo,1 point,Mon May 25 09:26:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on size and frequncy but most transformers for distribution are 98-99% efficient. As to ""acceptable"" it probably comes down to not so much that ithe tx gets too hot and damages the insulation on the windings, all losses manifest as heat."

ECE,36woa0,dhamilt9,11,Fri May 22 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"I have designed a few transmitter and receivers for USB3 IC's and have a few comments that may be useful. The requirements you describe seem quite demanding.   USB3 uses a differential impedance of 90 Ohm, CAT6 for instance uses 100 Ohm. This may not be a deal breaker because it's not the impedance as such that degrades the signal, it is impedance discontinuities. Ground noise unless it is too severe should not affect the signal too much because of differential signalling. The absolute killer for such high speed signals are impedance discontinuities causing reflections. Unless you are able to keep control over the impedance over your connectors there is very little chance of success. Two different USB3 receivers may perform very differently under the same conditions depending on how the circuit has been designed in regards to mainly equalisation scheme and clock and data recovery structure. Swopping equipment may therefore make  difference (though unless you manage to control the impedance in the channel there is very little chance of getting a working system so don't waste money on new equipment unnecessary). They way to measure channel impedance is with time-domain reflectometry. Without TDR measurements you would be stumbling in the dark. It is possible to separate the differential signal pairs into two separate individual shielded coaxial cables (well four, two in each direction). This may be a way for you to bridge the connections but you have to be very careful in the interface between differential and single ended. Directly soldering the cables is unlikely to work. Instead i'd recommend designing tiny pcb's with the right connectors where you are better able to control the impedance. You should also look into breaking the link into smaller segments using HUB's or active repeaters. Just google ""extending usb3 distance"" or something similar.   I'd be very interested to hear if you get the system to work, don't forget to post any progress or even lack thereof.  (Edit better line breaks)"

There are super strict timing and signal constraints to hit 5gbps, and that's one of them. If you can't get a signal from one end of the cable to the other in 25ns, forget about it.   Even if that wasn't an issue, the connector you're trying to pass it through likely presents an extremely large impedance discontinuity, of which USB3 is not tolerant of, at all.

Not only do you need to make sure that you are spec-ing in a D38999 that has a differential pair variant of the connector, you also need to then specify in the specific pins that are rated to handle the signal frequency. From what I can see of the connectors you have selected, they are not rated to handle the signal frequency required for USB 3.0. You should also know, that at the moment the tolerance on USB 3.0 is extremely tight. So much so that trying to swap from an Intel 20-Pin Header Style Connector to a similar connector (Sorry don't have a link at the moment) causes issues, even with a USB 3.0 ReDriver circuitry less than 100mil from the connector.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you switch to a different transmission format. Some other people have made suggestions of HD SDI or Ethernet. I strongly agree with this. I would also recommend trying 3G SDI or see if you can try something else with high frequency that can handle more loss.

ECE,36vq8z,upofadown,6,Fri May 22 15:45:39 2015 UTC,It depends. Are the problems related to the design or the layout? Often times while verifying a design you don't want a PCB at all and can do the work with breadboards. If the layout is the problem then you need to have the layout if you are going to debug it.  It is very common to underestimate the amount of uncertainty in a project. A good experienced designer can identify the uncertain aspects and allow those parts to be worked on ahead of the rest of the project. Such a designer can often resist management efforts to generate complete prototypes in the face of inadequate understanding of the problem.

Two things:  One, a fairly standard development type board, with the device on it and all sorts of breakouts and test points  Two, some extra hardware that can be used to poke and prod the main hardware, and stuff like beefier power supplies and so on to separate the design idea from the implementation (where the implementation is cost-effective and minimal, but the idea uses all sorts of more expensive components to prove the concept)."
ECE,36vq8z,quitte,1 point,Fri May 22 22:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my standard process, especially with microcontroller-based boards. Spin a quick prototype with breakout pins on every IC pin, lots of 0ohm resistors between modules (or a pair of pins that I can jumper to connect/disconnect different sections)  I'm usually pretty lax about clean routing and things like that. The goal is to bring up all of the circuit sections one by one (you can disconnect the power ICs from the rails to verify that you're getting the right voltages, for example). Things might not be perfect, but it's way easier to identify what's wrong and do a bodge here and there to correct any mistakes in the schematic.   If the board is good enough that I can start writing firmware, that's a solid win. Helps keep the project moving while we get ready for a production-candidate layout."
ECE,36vq8z,balboared,1 point,Sat May 23 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"Board level designer/engineer here. Several rounds(less than 3) of electrical prototypes is standard for any design that isn't mature or is receiving more than minor changes. The first one is usually square boards with 0805, lots of test points and lots of debug features. Subsequent builds become more integrated and start taking on the real form factor and component size required for the application. Experienced engineers will count on bugs/learning and build it into the schedule and budget."
ECE,36qtgw,elmkzgirxp,23,Thu May 21 11:44:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think your age has anything to do with grasping concepts, so long as you have the proper fundamentals down. Experience will help you grasp concepts, but starting young just means you'll have experiences while young. Older people just have more experience by default.  Also, at such a young age, your brain is still forming and really flexible, so I would say, as long as you like what you are studying, you are at a huge advantage."
ECE,36qtgw,kindalike,10,Thu May 21 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"Opinion time...  First, a 10% passing rate for a curriculum sounds incredibly low. Why is that the case? Where do people go if they don't get through ECE? Are the weeder courses in the first year, or are people dropping out towards the end? Is it just that the program lets anyone who wants to start, but many of them fail due to lack of preparation after the first semester?  Second, there's nothing that says we can't learn concepts earlier than other people. For example, in the US, calculus is generally taught around ages 17-19 (senior year of HS which is kindergarten + 12 years, or the first year of college) whereas in other countries calculus is often taught at the equivalent of 10th grade (kindergarten + 10) to 15-16-year-olds. I knew plenty of kids in the US who were a bit farther along and took calc around 16 as well.  But there is a limit, and the limit is not necessarily based on intelligence (I am sure you can find plenty of 11-year-olds who can understand calc just fine) but on culture and maturity.  So, here are two unpopular opinions. At 15, you're a pretty different person than you will be at 18, and again at 21. I'm not saying that you will change your mind about everything in the next five years, just that you should be prepared to allow yourself to change your mind. When I was 15, I knew for certain I wanted to be a programmer. When I was 18, I went to school for ECE. Not exactly opposite ends of the spectrum but after graduating, my work is quite different than what I imagined.  Two. Because 15 year olds and 18 year olds are pretty different, in maturity, thought, and so on... you're going to have trouble fitting in with people. Especially since you're probably already someone who likes working solo (just guessing). There's a lot of group work in ECE, and more simply, there's a need for human relationships. Making friends is hard, doing fun stuff is harder (drinking will always be a challenge until you're 21 due to the age difference, and there's a lot of drinking...)  Also, it doesn't help that in my experience, people who skip too many grades are often socially awkward: either too shy, or conceited and not afraid to show it. It's a challenge.  TLDR yes, being significantly younger poses problems. Not insurmountable but they are there. Identifying them is a large part of avoiding them. Don't set your thoughts in stone, and be nice to people."
ECE,36qtgw,gimpwiz,3,Thu May 21 20:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, by 'passing rate,' I meant 'number of graduates.' There was this one time that only one was able to graduate. But I guess it could also be that, as each semester, the number gets lower until 5 remains.   I don't have any problems socially. I am able to cope up with them.  Thank you for clearing it up."
ECE,36qtgw,gimpwiz,2,Fri May 22 03:12:04 2015 UTC,"Good.  Also, on a somewhat serious if possibly patronizing note, 15 year olds and drunkenness is a terrible combination. You have far less margin of error now than you will at 18 or 21 or 25 and I've seen too many kids ruin a good thing by excess. I don't mean to imply anything about you personally, in this post or the previous one, just mentioning common problems I saw."

There are a couple of people in my class who are a little younger than the rest of the class. One person is 3 years younger which means he started at 15 just like you! He is doing fine and has never failed anything. There is another person who started at 16 and he is one of the top students of the class.  You've managed to get past first year I'm sure you can finish. Keep up the good work!"

ECE,36qtgw,AntiMe,3,Thu May 21 18:25:43 2015 UTC,Well paying jobs
ECE,36qtgw,quitte,3,Thu May 21 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"to answer the second part of your post,  The titles of the profession can be a bit vague but electrical/electronics engineering is a good bit different than computer engineering. Communications is a sub-discipline of electrical/electronics engineering. As for the difference between electrical and electronics engineering, I would say what you have in mind is electronics engineering. Electrical engineering refers to the sub discipline that deals with power generation, distribution etc. They are, however, used interchangeably. In my opinion they are all sub-disciplines of electrical and computer engineering so I don't really worry about it too much. (In practice, ce and ee are probably analogous to mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering)"
ECE,36qtgw,GeoStarRunner,2,Thu May 21 19:12:06 2015 UTC,It will be at least a little outdated in just about any college.  As long as you have the self-discipline and appropriate math/science background you should be on equal footing in the classroom.
ECE,36qtgw,gsl22,2,Thu May 21 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"Being young gives you time. So you are at an advantage, agewise.  Don't worry about the passing rate, too much. That more than likely includes people that changed majors or gave up as opposed to having failed in a way that can not be recovered from.  A lot of graduating is levelling up. It doesn't matter if you don't understand all of it. Even knowing some concept exists is valuable information. You can still dig deeper into it once it becomes what would be a useful tool.  Being too young to grasp something is a fallacy. You won't magically become wiser with age. You become wiser with knowledge and experience.  Even if your performance was affected by your age (which i argued that it is not) a passing grade is still a passing grade. And since you are young you could easily add to that later. Or continue studying out of university.  The path to becoming an engineer is a hard one. And not giving up along the way is one of the major hurdles in finishing the walk."
ECE,36p0h2,heroyi,6,Thu May 21 00:05:20 2015 UTC,"The way I had it explained to me was that in embedded, much of the hands-on stuff can and is outsourced, but things like high level design and requirements will not (ie. Senior Engineer type roles).  Manufacturing and programming work can both be outsourced fairly easily; it's the requirements design and engineering experience that's harder to get."
ECE,36p0h2,HylianSavior,2,Thu May 21 00:10:44 2015 UTC,seems like the chicken and egg problem. How can one achieve senior engineer roles without going through the entry level hands-on stuff
ECE,36p0h2,HylianSavior,5,Thu May 21 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"It does seem a bit like that, but I wouldn't worry about it too much if you're interested in going into embedded. The market for embedded engineers is still huge."

To me embedded requires more knowledge and skills (reading datasheets, timing, memory/hardware constraints etc...) yet they get paid US avg of around 60K. Obviously there are outliers with big tech companies but to me it seems rather disappointing to see the field unappreciated so to speak. Whereas software engineers are in the prime in Silicone valley and other places.   Quora forum did make a good point though that software has a much easier development cycle thus its popularity like Uber and Snapchat hiring developers like crazy."

ECE,36p0h2,falconPancho,3,Thu May 21 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"""boom"" and ""gold"" seem to evoke the idea of some kind of gold rush. I would be wary of such things. What you have to ask yourself is: is your specific skill set valuable and not easily replaceable? If the answer is yes, that gives you an advantage. If the answer is no, it's just a matter of luck, and you're very susceptible to industry trends. The internet boom of the late 1990s/early 2000s ended badly and I think it was more a matter of if/when you got in and out of the tech boom that made a difference in who made lots of money. If you like switching jobs you can try to ride a boom, but I personally have no stomach for that and would rather be working in a stable and successful career."

It is also very fun to expat over there. Singapore is a gorgeous city (I lived there for two years, and I'm looking forward to live there again in the future... perhaps after my Master's...). And although it is very expensive, the salaries are to match and the place is surrounded by incredible and incredibly cheap places to visit with great history and an amazing culture (if you are into that) such as Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, VietNam, Indonesia... the list gets long. I don't know about Taiwan, but it must be similar, and I have never lived but regularly visited Japan and I love it, but that's perhaps because I really love Japanese culture and cuisine from my early teens. :P. In any case, the takeaway is that Asia is an experience worth living, and a place in which you can have a real impact on developing new technologies. Also a great place to live. Ps. You don't have to 'give up' your citizenship to live in Asia (any country), you just work there as a 'Permanent Resident' (in Singapore), in which case they give you a 'Green Card' that allows you to live there lawfully. After you no longer live there you give them your green card upon departure and keep your own passport."

I'm guessing at least Quartus - have you used any advanced features like SignalTap, LogicLock, etc.?  How about software (C/Python) IDEs?  Are you proficient with lab tools (DMMs, oscilliscopes, network analyzers, function generators, etc.)?  Your project work is good but you're information is only regarding the goal of the project and now how you accomplished it.  For instance, you smart lighting project.  Did you manufacture a 4-layer PCB, solder it on perfboard, breadboard it, or use a dev board?  Were you running a custom OS on the MSP430, or running bare metal code?  What programming language did you use?  What features of the MSP430 did you use (PWMs? ADC/DAC? watchdogs? do you know what these are?)  And that's just the one project.  What about details on the other ones?  Lots of these questions will come up on interviews - but you can add details beforehand, especially for achievements you're particularly proud of.  I know there's limited space, but I also like to see a list of relevant classwork - e.g. was your class emphasis on analog electronics, or digital design, operating systems, or what?  Did your school offer any tracks or emphases?  Also ""Bachelor of engineering, computer"" is a little awkward.  Again, be totally prepared to be grilled in detail on anything on your resume, so make sure you really know what's on your resume - no fluff!  If you don't know it, remove it from the resume.  Also, definitely tailor the resume for the position you're applying to - you have limited space (and attention from the recruiter) so make the info for each job relevant.  I'd make a longer resume and trim it down depending on the role I'm applying for."

Noone wants to look at a 5 page resume - this is just a tool for your own reference so you can quickly create a detailed, role-targeted resume.  For instance some companies may care more about your EE experience, while another is looking for an HDL specialist.  You should have enough content to provide a solid one-pager for each of these with good details about what you've done in that field.  Maybe there are two job openings that you might want to apply to in a larger company - you could pick the projects that have the most overlap in both these areas so you can be considered for both positions, and figure out which is the best fit during the interview.

A personal pet peeve is wasted space. On my resume, new lines need at least 5 words on them. 1-3 words either needs to get shorter or longer. Also, one sentence per bullet point.  I wouldn't break out projects the way you have it. Lump them all together. And do NOT use the word 'relevant'. As nit-picky as this sounds, you don't know what's relevant. Further, it takes away from your personal projects as they don't get labeled relevant. It's also redundant. If the experience were irrelevant, it shouldn't be on the resume.  Specify group and solo projects as well as timelines. If it was a group, what non-technical roles did you fill?  Finally, details are the devil and a fine line to learn to walk. These bullets are conversation starters. What you need is enough detail to be interesting, not complete. When I was in IT, I had 3 resumes depending on the job I'm applying for.

The differentiation you have for the projects looks good, I was overreacting to the 'Relevant'.  However, if it were my resume, I would eliminate the ""Personal Projects"" heading to include some non-technical things you like to do under extracurricular. Karaoke, trivia night, minigolf, baseball, cooking, anything you do more than once a month. If you go that route, you could shorten the ARDT section to a single line, ""Lead computer vision development on the ARDT"". They're going to ask you about that, be ready to run down the objective, your goal and your contribution in ~5 sentences.  As for the non-technical interests. If you get lucky, one of your interviewers has a similar or related interest (or they ask out of curiosity) and you become instantly more memorable. More interviewers present, better percentage chance and allows you to have a one-on-one, friendly dialogue with someone usually at the beginning of the process. You establish some tone, burn some time and make the whole thing less miserable.  Minor corrections:   First project, 2nd bullet is 2 sentences. First project, 4th bullet: ""with group members,""?

ECE,36j6pt,-007-bond,8,Tue May 19 19:53:27 2015 UTC,Last I was aware/involved a lot of the funding for ECE research into Quantum Computing dried up because practical devices that really deliver on the promise of QC were a ways off.  Honestly if you're interested in Quantum Computing there are lots of other device related research topics (basically all ECE QC research is going to be device and not system level at this point).  But either way you're essentially going to be a physics student if you go down this route whether you're in the physics department or ECE.
ECE,36j6pt,SmokeyDBear,6,Wed May 20 00:30:49 2015 UTC,"I was a physics undergrad, and I did my undergrad research in quantum computing. As of now, it is still very much in the physics departments, mainly because the physics knowledge required to actually implement a working QC outweighs any practical ECE knowledge that is commonly taught. However, part of this field includes Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Algorithms, which I believe crosses over into ECE territory. But, until a reliable QC is developed, these things are sort of secondary. If you are interested in a broad but technical view of the field, check out this paper by David Deutsch. I bet if you showed interest for a PhD, a few ECE departments would allow you do some research in these topics, but you would likely be working very closely with physicists."
ECE,36j6pt,sowr,3,Wed May 20 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"I don't see this mentioned here, but back when regular computers were a new thing, it was completely a physics thing.

ECE,36j7ou,shhimhuntingrabbits,8,Tue May 19 19:59:49 2015 UTC,You should be able to hook a scope/spectrum analyzer up to the 24V line and see if there is a 50/60hz signal present.  You can try to fight it with shielding or twisted pair from the sensor into a differential amp.
ECE,36j7ou,snailwithajetpack,8,Tue May 19 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"Even better shielded twisted-pair instrumentation cable.    You can get common mode noise that isn't line noise as well (e.g. noise from motor commutators, harmonics, etc.)"
ECE,36j7ou,mantrap2,6,Tue May 19 20:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, very possible if the sensor has a high impedance output (weak drive strength).  Also possible at RF frequencies regardless of drive strength, which could be possible if the fan is driven by a speed controller, or has noisy brushes."
ECE,36j7ou,bradn,1 point,Tue May 19 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? Why would a high imedpance output on the sensor make it easier for the high voltage line to induce current on it? When you say it's possible at RF frequencies, where would these frequencies be coming from if the high voltage line is only running at 60Hz?"
ECE,36j7ou,bradn,1 point,Wed May 20 12:30:50 2015 UTC,"Why would a high impedance output on the sensor make it easier for the high voltage line to induce current on it?   Because a low impedance driven line will effectively suck up any current put on it by low frequency interference, resulting in very low voltage change visible at either end compared to the normal signal, but a high impedance driven line can't absorb the current fast enough, and then the voltage changes.   When you say it's possible at RF frequencies, where would these frequencies be coming from if the high voltage line is only running at 60Hz?   High frequency effects can be caused when there are fast changes in either current through wires or voltage on them.  The division between low/high frequency relates to the length of the wires and electric signal propagation speed (some fraction of speed of light, I forget).  The difference is that even if the lines are completely grounded, the pulses of current can't be effectively drained from the wire because there isn't enough time for it to physically leave the wire, and so voltage changes will be visible at the ends as the pulses reach them.  If there is a speed controller on the motor, it probably works by some type of switching action happening in the controller, such that the motor is getting very short pulses of voltage on the different coil, that average out to being the correct voltage (and therefore inducing the correct current in the coils) over the kind of timespans the motor responds to.  For example, a motor that normally runs at 60Hz might be receiving a chopped signal at 25KHz that when averaged out, looks like a 40Hz sine wave, and the motor is running about 2/3 its normal speed.  But, if the edges are sharp on this 25KHz switching, there will be little pulses of noise at 25KHz induced on other nearby stuff from the line, if it isn't shielded.  Here, the problem isn't so much that 25KHz is near radio frequency (it isn't unless you look at huge long wires), the problem is that the switching of the individual pulses might be happening in a couple microseconds or less, without adequate filtering at the output.  The faster the switching is, the less heat gets burned in the switching devices in the speed controller.  Similarly, a brushed motor with bad brush contact might have some funny radio emission happening (miniature spark gap generator).  The kind of interference received from that would be very short pops of high frequency noise happening at whatever switching rate the speed controller (or brushes) work at.  Whether it is a problem for the sensor receiver depends on if it is sensitive to those short pops.  There are also multiple ways noise can be coupled... capacitive coupling, inductive (transformer-like) coupling, radio waves, etc.  Shielding the source of the noise usually helps for all of them."
ECE,36j7ou,bradn,1 point,Wed May 20 15:57:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for  the detailed reply.    Because a low impedance driven line will effectively suck up any current put on it by low frequency interference, resulting in very low voltage change visible at either end compared to the normal signal, but a high impedance driven line can't absorb the current fast enough, and then the voltage changes. The probe line is DC, so do the concepts of low impedance driven or high impedance driven still apply here?    For example, a motor that normally runs at 60Hz might be receiving a chopped signal at 25KHz that when averaged out, looks like a 40Hz sine wave, and the motor is running about 2/3 its normal speed. But, if the edges are sharp on this 25KHz switching, there will be little pulses of noise at 25KHz induced on other nearby stuff from the line, if it isn't shielded.     So if the motor is being powered by the 480V AC lines, would the chopped 25KHz signal be traveling through the lines? Otherwise I don't induced current from the speed controller would be effecting the probe lines, as they are a significant distance from the controller."
ECE,36j7ou,kuatsimoto,1 point,Wed May 20 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"So if the motor is being powered by the 480V AC lines, would the chopped 25KHz signal be traveling through the lines?   Yes, with varying possible degrees of filtering.  If the output is fully filtered, it will look just like a plain sine wave and this is the best possible case for anti-interference purposes.  Note that you still have many hundreds of volts swinging around ~60 times a second, so this can still induce interference but it is possible to overcome this with a low impedance driver, and probably a shielded cable going to the sensor would also help because I don't think you want to mess with the sensor itself (though, it could be possible to put an active buffer directly on the sensor, which would make its output low impedance... but more complex).  If there is very little filtering applied, the output to the motor will look a lot like a square wave, with the pulse length and distance between pulses set to approximate the power transfer that a real sine wave would cause.  Again, it is the sharp edges of the square wave that make things worse... the better smoothed the edges are, the less problems."
ECE,36j7ou,alle0441,2,Wed May 20 22:21:16 2015 UTC,What current is the AC wire running? And what frequency? The higher both of these are the more induced voltage you will have. Shielding and twisting the wires might help.
ECE,36j7ou,ElecEng66,2,Tue May 19 21:30:15 2015 UTC,"If the 480VAC is three phase with all three phase wires run together, then little to no net EM field is created."

You could try a limit switch like this with the switch pressed when it's raised and when it drops it releases the switch like this.

ECE,36fkjx,whatthehifi,2,Tue May 19 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"The various design approaches you've mentioned are all valid things people do in design. What is more useful to you career wise depends on what kind of role interests you (or is more in demand).   At an architectural systems level you'll design and simulate using RTL level descriptions. You'll be making big architectural timing analyses and optimisations, based probably on existing or assumed timing, performance and mismatch/variation characteristics. You or someone else would probably then take the simulations a step further by laying out the circuit with VLSI cells and simulate those to characterise circuit performance after parasitics extraction. (You'll rarely have a systems person putting down transistors AFAIK, usually you have high level cell designs all ready to go.)   At a circuits/VLSI level, you'll look at circuits at the transistor level and try to find new techniques, topologies, etc. to optimise performance and behaviour. This is more of a research than a production role, and what you produce may become library cells that higher level designers later use within the company.

Would something like this work for you?  always_comb begin      #INITIAL_DELAY;      forever begin         if (clk === 1'bx) begin             // report error         end         #CLK_PERIOD;     end  end   Edit: I thought about this for another minute. You could use a single # to drive a start_x_check signal high at the start of sim and then have the assertions start after it goes high. You could also generate a testbench clock to sample the signals for the X check.
ECE,36f2nz,ProgrammableGatorade,1 point,Mon May 18 23:45:08 2015 UTC,"Its hard to tell without seeing the design. Presuming clk inputs to various modules are fully synchronous and any sort of gating is done in the module, you should be able to write a single top level assertion for clk--even though it is not clear to me why clk would have x's--z's for sure--but x's? Now that clk is verified, write assertions latched off of clk. Write delayed assertions inside each module block for the interface:   ^bus===1'bx    However I could be missing what you are trying to do entirely.   Depending on your verification infrastructure and which OVLs it supports this might be helpful. I don't think it is strictly spec, but it is an ARM OVL proposed for adoption   assert_never_at_x_or_z(clk, reset_n, qualifier, test_expr)   It is designed to check for X's only when the qualifier is asserted."
ECE,36fazl,420Blaze1t,5,Mon May 18 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"First let's label the transistors so we can talk about them more easily: (Improved Schematic)   Why would the designer use a differential pair in the middle?         Whoa, Q3-Q4 are not a differential pair.  That's two NPN emitter followers with their collectors tied together (and tied to the positive supply rail).  The ""design pattern"" which is the key to understanding this circuit, is the 10K-1K-10K ""T topology"" between the output of Q1 {its emitter} and the input of Q3 {its base}.  That right there is a switched attenuator with Q2 functioning as the switch.  When Q2 is off, the bottom of the 1K floats and there's ~ no attenuation from Q1 to Q3.  When Q2 is on, the bottom of the 1K is grounded and there's an eleven-to-one attenuation from Q1 to Q2 (-20.8 dB).  What turns Q2 on and off?  Why it's nothing but a ""peak detector design pattern"" made of the diode and the 220uF electrolytic capacitor in the base circuit.  Emitter follower Q4's output is AC coupled via a 10uF capacitor.  If the peaks of this AC waveform rise (Vdiode + Vbeq2) above ground, they turn on Q2 and the peak value is stored in the 220uF capacitor.  It takes a good long while to discharge, since the discharge path is the base current of Q2 and nothing else.  Q2's collector current is about (9/11)ths of a milliamp, so if its Beta is 100, Q2's base current is ~ 8 microamps.  It will take a good long time for 8uA to discharge 220uF.  If Q2 is off, the audio input at left, flows through a gain-of-one emitter follower (Q1) and then through another gain-of-one emitter follower (Q3) to the output.  If Q2 is on, the gain from audio input to output is reduced by -20.8 dB.  On the other hand, the microphone input at far right, flows through two common emitter amplifiers.  Q6 has a gain of about -33X and Q5 has a gain of about -10X to its collector.  This signal flows through an ""audio mixer design pattern"" (the two 10K resistors that drive the base of Q3), and into the base of Q3.  Crucially, the Mic input signal is NOT attenuated by the eleven-to-one T circuit controlled by Q2.  And there you have it.  If the mic input is very quiet, it gets mixed one-to-one with the audio input, and presented at the output.  On the other hand, if the mic input is loud, it gets mixed one to (1/11th) with the audio input and presented to the output.  When the mic input is loud, it attenuates the audio input before mixing."
ECE,36fazl,fatangaboo,2,Wed May 20 13:41:38 2015 UTC,"So this guy clearly knows about analog circuits (props).  I myself am not an analog circuit designer, but I know enough about it and I've met enough people to understand the methodology.  The key to looking at a schematic that someone else has designed is to break it up into pieces.  ""I know this is a peak detector, I know this is an emitter follower, I know this is a current source"", etc.  Don't get bogged down by the little details.  Notice fatangaboo was able to come up with estimates of the gains and attenuation of certain parts of the circuit.  Every good Engineer I've ever met is able to do a quick calculation like that on the spot and it really helps when you're just trying to get a sense of what the circuit is doing.  When you start from scratch in a circuit design, you have to have a logical basis of what you want to do.  ""I want to mix audio, I want the mic to be louder than the audio when it detects sounds"", etc.  From there you start building a picture in your head of what it takes to do these certain things because someone has already done it before you, ""Oh, I need a peak detector here, I need some amplification here, I need to attenuate by this factor here to produce this specific output here"".  You may use pieces of a circuit design you've seen someone else do because you know the performance characteristics of it and it would be useful for what you're trying to do.  There's no reason to reinvent the wheel if you don't have to.  Even if you use some cookbook circuits in a larger circuit design, chances are you will be adding and changing stuff enough to make it your own unique'ish circuit.  Then you will remember what you did on the next design and you'll be throwing down circuits from memory and it will appear as if you are able to just do EVERYTHING from scratch.  It's like when Jazz players improv, they remember small licks and tunes they've practiced and they piece everything together on the spot to come up with something that sounds unique and different.  All that remains is knowing the nuts and bolts and TRADEOFFS of different circuits.  The difference between a good Engineer and someone who is using circuit recipes is that an Engineer knows the benefits of using one circuit but he also knows what the performance tradeoff for every benefit is (there is ALWAYS a tradeoff).  So to become better, look at LOTS of circuits, DESIGN lots of circuit from scratch so you know all the issues with them, and just build your toolbox of knowledge as best as you possibly can.  (Again, get REALLY good at 'back of the envelope' calculations that you can do quickly to estimate things so you don't spend time deriving unnecessary equations.  Remember that in Engineering, we just want to meet our design goals for the most part which will never ask for perfection in EVERY area.  You can design something with estimations and fine tune later on.)  One final note is there may be little things that are really hard to understand until you actually see the circuit in action.  Remember that your design will have issues (almost always) you didn't quite account for and that's when you start saying ""Oh I'll just feed that output back through a common base and add this resistor here to reduce some of the transient kick I'm seeing"".  These are the fine tuning components that may trip you up when you first see a circuit someone else designed, but don't be intimidated by the fact that it's not readily obvious what a particular component is doing."

I am in a mixed signal group so I work closely with analog designers so it helps to understand physics and basics like integration though.  For example, the part I work on now has an energy limiting feature.  It helps development when I understand the basics of power <-> energy conversions and integration.

ECE,368rk3,gimpwiz,2,Mon May 18 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"The best way to learn comp arch is probably to take a comp arch course. It's one of the few courses where I learned more from class than I would have by dicking around with components.  Usually such courses are called something like comp arch, comp organization, comp organization and architecture, etc. They tend to be the core, super duper required course for CE majors. If you can't find it in your course catalog, ask a friend or an advisor or a professor.  Usually such a course would go over, roughly:   Review of boolean logic Assembly (MIPS is a good candidate because of simplicity) Binary (hex) opcodes, and how to assemble ASM to hex An overview of how a compiler compiles C to ASM A basic processor core (again, MIPS is a good candidate) Adding pipelines to the core Cache and memory architecture Efficiency, penalties, etc (in other words, what kind of code is more efficient, and also how to make a CPU more efficient for commonly used code) The general architecture of how a processor can be made better - making it superscalar, out-of-order issues, predictive branching, and so on; as well as specifics (for example, predictive branching is simple to explain and implement)   Now that gives you a basis for how a CPU core works with cache and main memory to execute C -> ASM -> binary.  But as you might imagine, this is great theory, incredibly important, but doesn't exactly lend itself well to developing consumer electronics. Someone designing a CPU core is fairly far removed from things like power regulators, decoupling capacitors, GPIOs, and so on. So here's part 2: the microcontroller.  You can take a class to learn this, but it's also fairly easy to learn by just doing (on the job or on your own time and dime.) Take any microcontroller/microprocessor - from your fifty cent 8-bit PIC to your fifty dollar big-core beast - and it will have some of the same core functionality: power input and grounding requirements, IOs, communication protocols, how to program it to do useful things, interrupt controllers and priority and masking, data acquisition, memory-mapped registers, and so on.  As  you might imagine, a 50 cent micro is much easier to develop and design for... and you can much more easily afford them.  Whether it's in a course, or you buy something like an arduino (but programmed in C as soon as you master the arduino language basics), or you make your own PIC PCB (highly recommend this by the way), you will implement a lot of what I mentioned above. If you make your own PCB, you also get to learn about sourcing components and designing around them and so on.  To be useful in industry, you should have knowledge of these and more:   Toolchains (compiler, programmer software, programmer hardware) to go from idea to code to code running on the chip Writing a basic program to flash an LED or something Memory-mapped registers - for example writing a value to an address to change something, like to flash an LED or writing a value to read a button input; Using an API for stuff like peripheral libraries - for example, instead of writing to a memory-mapped register, using a function like GPIO_OUTPUT(your value) Using in-line assembly in your C (I don't really recommend writing pure ASM though of course it is possible) (From here on, assume everything is done with a combination of memory-mapped registers, API/driver calls, and inline ASM) Configuring your various I/O pins to various functions (input, output, pullups, communication protocols, etc etc etc Learning what PWM is and how to use it Learning how to use analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converters if there are any on-chip, or building your own using a PWM, cap, and resistor Learning what UART is and how to use it, and talking to your computer over UART Learning SPI, I2C Learning USB (pro mode, harder than you think) ... and understanding parallel versus serial protocols, different bus topologies, timing requirements, and so on Learning how to implement a clock (crystal, resonator, RLC circuit) and how to use it Learning interrupt basics (GPIO, timer, on-board stuff like ADC acquisition) And learning fancier interrupt stuff, like masking interrupts dynamically during processing, interrupt priority if possible, what critical sections are Learning how to use a scope, though you only find fancier functionality through experience Learning signaling basics for circuit design (what do you need to care about when doing USB? how about UART? At what speeds can you run things reliably? How do you check?) Use interrupts to bit-bang some protocols like UART, meaning re-implement them from scratch, just for practice Learn how to interface with different voltages, different drive strengths (how do you use a 50 cent controller to drive a 10 watt LED, for example, or a 120V light bulb?) Learn how to interface with big coils (motors, solenoids, generators, etc) Learn basics of power design - regulators, battery chargers, where and why to place bypass capacitors   I'm missing like a thousand things off this list, but it's enough to get started.  If you do this by yourself, here are some projects that teach you most of this:   Make a PCB with your choice of microcontroller that is battery powered, communicates wirelessly with something (preferably something attached to your computer so you can send commands), that drives motors to do something; for example, a remote control car or something Make a PCB with a PIC that gets wireless code updates from your computer, so you can program it remotely, and is failure resistant (what happens if you stop programming halfway through?)   You get the point."
ECE,368rk3,gimpwiz,2,Mon May 18 23:22:58 2015 UTC,"Whoah! Thanks for the incredible amount of information, this is super helpful! I will definitely try to take a comp arch course at some point.   And it just so happens I've been wanting to learn more about PICs and was looking for a project to do this summer. Thanks for the suggestion;  that sounds like a great project!   If you know of any good resources for projects with the PIC that would be awesome too."
ECE,368rk3,gimpwiz,2,Tue May 19 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"What I use to develop for PIC:   Their standard IDE, MPLAB X, which works on linux (yay) A PicKit 3 (you can use a 2 for half the price; they are open hardware so you can buy a clone on ebay that will work great) The datasheet for the specific PIC chip I am using The datasheets of devices with which I am interfacing For a quick start guide, if I want to use an X thingamabob and I have no idea what I'm doing (example, 7-segment display driver) I simply google ""arduino X"" (""arduino 7-segment display driver"") and get a ton of results.   The last note is funny - I'm not actually using an arduino, but there's a lot of documentation for arduinos, and I usually just want to see the basics (how is it wired? what's the code look like?) without spending an hour researching it.  But in all seriousness - the PIC datasheets are fantastic and I pretty much need nothing else except for the PIC datasheet and the datasheet of the device I am using alongside the PIC. The more I do it, the less I need, as you might imagine.  So in summary, I don't use a specific resource as much as just the datasheets and my own experience. You won't have the last part :) but everyone starts at the same place and it's easier today than ever before to get the datasheets and figure out how to use the parts.  This carries over well to real life - I am working with fairly large chips now on my stuff, and when I need to get the chip talking to some random peripheral I've never used before... datasheets. Seriously, that's it. They're usually bigger and much less well written than the PIC datasheets, but it's almost always all there."
ECE,368rk3,frank26080115,2,Tue May 19 01:08:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the double reply... I don't like to edit for stuff like this in case you miss the edit.  One of the interesting, and somewhat ironic aspects of ""going pro"" so to speak, is that certain things get easier.  Consider a lot of amateur-level designs and components used. You're attaching GPIOs to stuff like LEDs, buttons, transistors, and so on and so on. A lot of components are similarly naked: their datasheets will tell you to wiggle this line like so, send this PWM signal as a reference, power it at this rate, and so on. You end up with a lot of stuff to keep track of, and a relatively complex circuit with a lot of components - simple ones, though. This nicely lets you put test points to figure out what your circuit is doing. It also teaches you what these devices are doing internally - because they expose it all to you.  When you work in industry, you do that as little as possible. You start with a microcontroller and a basic environment you wrote. Now, you want an ADC. Okay, put the ADC on your I2C line: when you want data, you issue a read command and get a response back. Want extra storage? Put it on a SPI or I2C line. Want a DAC? Put it on a SPI or I2C line. Want to talk to something? Use UART. Want to drive LEDs? Put an LED driver on a SPI or I2C line. Ethernet, USB? Get a chip that has ethernet and USB built in, or use an FTDI chip and talk to it using UART. Fancy power supply? I2C. Fancy glue logic? Put a CPLD down, use I2C or SPI or EPI. Need to charge a battery? Battery charger with an enable pin.  So you spend all this time twiddling signals to learn how it all works, but when it gets down to it, you end up with fairly complex circuits... that are mostly composed of chips, communication channels, power supplies and supply planes, lots of bypass capacitors. Oh, you might use a naked button or LED, but your LEDs are driven with FET ICs and your buttons get a pull-up/pull-down with a small capacitance in the chip. All that signal twiddling bullshit is rarely used. But you need to know how it all works before you start putting real money into it.  Oh, and PCBs with through-hole components on one side with one or two electrical layers turn into PCBs with surface-mount components on both sides with 4... or 8... or more layers. Things get very small very quickly. Enjoy hand-soldering while you can, and learn to hand-solder SMT parts of reasonable size."

ECE,368rk3,PlatinumX,2,Sun May 17 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"What I do day-to-day depends on what phase of a project I'm in.  My role is to take a project from concept to production.  It starts by working with a project manager and team leadership to help define the product.  At this point it's kind of like a consultancy role, where you can help by understanding the current (actually, future) state of technology and what is feasible (or will be feasible in 3-6 months).  You should already have talked with all your manufacturers and gotten chip roadmaps, so you know what's available to use.  You need to know what's physically possible and what isn't, and if it can fit in a budget.  You can also push for any technology or features you really want.  Next you draw out the schematics.  Read all the datasheets cover to cover and understand them.  You will have to work with your teammates on specifics, for instance we have a power team, RF team, mechanical team, etc. that all need to understand the requirements and can help design the system.  It's kind of the funnest part because it's all blue-sky solutioneering (lulz) at that point.  When the schematic is done you send it to your team and IC vendors for review.  If it comes back good it's time for layout.  With a smaller team on a very simple project, you may do the layout yourself.  However there are layout engineers that are much better and faster than you at layout, so generally your role is to monitor and support them.  They don't necessarily understand what you were thinking when you wired it up, so you need to supply constraints like trace length and width for different nets/power planes, board stackup, height requirements.  The whole team is working together at this point to make sure their portions are drawn correctly.  You and the rest of the team need to do a thorough review and make sure there aren't any issues.  When you like how it looks, you send it out for fab and assembly.  Then it's time for board bring up!  This is where you are hands on with lab equipment, making your design work.  These boards allow you and your test team to test and validate the design.  You also start working with the manufacturing team to make sure the design is going to be reliable and yield is good.  You do 3 cycles of this (Prototype, EVT, and DVT stages) and release to production.  You may even have to go to the factory (sometimes in China) to monitor the assembly line.  There are some variations of this depending on what kind of product you're working on and what company you work for, but overall the workflow is pretty standard, in my experience."

ECE,368rk3,BoratRemix,2,Sun May 17 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Think about computers - every computer is designed before the silicon is ready.  This works because:   Most OEMs / ODMs know what previous motherboards looked like, and can design most of the next year's motherboard without knowing precisely what the CPU is and does Most features on the CPU are known ahead of time They also get reference designs that they can copy&paste as a starting point And they get engineering samples (ES) which are basically un-released and somewhat buggier versions of the chips, months before they start getting manufactured in volume   There are always risks in designing around as of yet unreleased parts. The part might be late, fucking your entire roadmap (and if it causes you to miss christmas, for example, the entire company might go down the tubes). The part might be missing promised features, or the features might be broken. Generally speaking, if your unreleased parts are from big companies with support, service, technical sales, and a solid history of delivering, you won't lose much sleep but it is always risky.  IC vendors reviewing designs is, like almost every other big contract, a question of money and heft. For example, a small IC vendor might review customer designs as a matter of course because they have no choice and have to guarantee that every customer buys a lot of parts. Or on the other hand, a big IC vendor might review designs because they can easily pay the salaries of people to review them, and are forward-thinking. Generally speaking, if you want your designs reviewed, either 1) be much bigger than your supplier, so they work to please you, or 2) spend a lot of money, either paying for review or just by being big enough to go on the VIP list.  Example - I used to work for Intel. If you worked with intel, you'd get engineering samples ahead of time. You knew that most features would be delivered. You'd get reference designs that you could literally copy and paste and slap your own name on to sell. And when you modified the reference design and fucked it up, you could call intel to send out some engineers (you do probably pay for this) and they will tell you what's wrong and how to fix it. A lot of small white-box OEMs would quite literally use rebadged reference designs in their products, and no customer was worse off for it, since the reference designs at least worked properly. Intel didn't give a shit - in fact, encouraged it - because they weren't in the business of being secretive with motherboard designs like an OEM might be, their business is to sell chips, and a small OEM rebadging a reference design meant their thing would work and they wouldn't go bankrupt and would therefore buy plenty of chips."

ECE,368rk3,srqp,1 point,Mon May 18 19:26:20 2015 UTC,Programming micro controllers isn't really hardware design.  Hardware design (in the digital world) is writing RTL (verilog or VHDL).  That is the language micro controllers are made of.  If you want to just write code for micro controllers then you can even do that in CS.  I think you just need to spend another year in school so you get to know the course material before you make a decision on where you want to end up.
ECE,368m9h,ianmcw95,3,Sun May 17 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Earlish.  You WILL need to replace those resistors; they are made the way they are to dissipate heat.  It appears (though hard to tell) that the one on the left says 2W .470K, which would mean that it is a 470Ω resistor, rated to dissipate 2 watts.  To be on the safe side, use an ohmmeter to verify their resistance.  You can probably measure them OK in circuit, but may need to lift a leg.  A cheap ohmmeter can be found at Harbor Freight or Northern Tool.  I rather like their $4 Cen-tech ones; surprisingly good for the price.  You may wish to replace the electrolytic capacitors (the little beer cans, labeled ""C1"" or ""C82"" or whatever on the circuit board.  These degrade over time, and have a finite shelf life.  Regarding replacement resistor sources, Newark or Digi-key or Mouser will be good options.  You CAN increase the wattage rating, if they are cheaper or more easily found, than the 2W ones.  Don't go down, though, as they can burn up.  If you wanted to just test the thing out, you could apply power for a very small amount of time.  You don't want to run it long enough for those resistors to heat up, but I'd easily think you could go 10-30 seconds with little fear.  Moisture just caused the sand/clay shell of those to disintegrate.  Just wash the board, or brush the stuff away, or leave it be.  It is non-conductive.  If you wanted to, you could put the board in a dishwasher, even... you'd just need to get it perfectly dry before applying power.  If it were mine, I'd yank the resistors, measure each one, brush away the debris, replace the resistors, and put it back together.  I don't know if I'd bother with replacing the caps, unless I knew I would want to be using this for years and years.  Even at that, if it ain't broke, don't fix it...  I'd probably elect to replace the caps down the road after a failure, and any components that failed as a result."

This does not damage electronics.  In fact, there were many benefits to this.  The boards would look better, all dust and grease would be removed allowing for better heat dissipation, board damage is more easily seen, conductive corrosion and electrolyte were removed, and so on.

I'm concerned about this because sometimes carbon film resistors can open with no visual indication and moisture can bring this about.  Once you replace the obviously bad resistors, please verify the bias current by checking the voltage drop across two resistors in the unit.  Look for 10mV +/- 1mV across R428 and adjust as needed using VR402. Likewise, repeat the measurement for R427 and adjust to the same voltage using VR401.   Bias adjustments should be made with the volume at minimum, tone controls and balance centered, loudness contour off, stereo/mono switch in the stereo position and an 8 ohm resistive load connected to the speaker terminals. (Obviously the speaker switch should be on). This is different from most amps which want bias to be set with no load. (H/K has always been a wee bit different with their service procedures than the Japanese amps.)  If in the course of restoring this receiver you find a blown output transistor, you MUST check the biasing network. If the biasing network goes, you will ruin your new transistors in very short order.

Spice is dividing the time slices thinner and thinner, but still not getting a consistent answer and gives up.

ECE,365q0x,fatangaboo,2,Sat May 16 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"The error means the simulator can't find a solution for the circuit equation even when it reduces the timestep to practically zero.  That usually means there is a discontinuity in the equation that prevents a solution from being found.  In your case, the discontinuity is caused by having ideal digital gates connected in feedback with no delays.  Replace the gates with actual transistor models, or add delay to remove the discontinuity from the equation.  This also often occurs if you have ideal switches in your circuit."

ECE,3649gj,phdthrow12,4,Sat May 16 00:11:35 2015 UTC,I think a masters degree is a good thing.  I did it and I have not regretted it.   good luck.
ECE,3649gj,ahbushnell,4,Sat May 16 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"A few observations:  I went straight through and got an MS before graduating. Best decision ever. You are in the student mindset, it's hard to get out and then turn it back on. I have several colleagues working and going back for a Masters and their lives look like hell. And if you work for a few years, you'll get use to great money and then you won't have any if you go back to school full time.   Why weren't you looking for a job earlier than now? Major companies have already filled this year's new college grad positions. I am a recruiter for a Fortune 500 company and our spots were filled before Christmas.   I agree with the other post that having a 3.4 and three co-ops should get you in most doors. Analyze what you are doing wrong or aren't doing right. If you have hardware experience like you say than amplify that. There are enough positions in this country for hardware engineers. You can spend some time self-teaching embedded software. But you probably don't need it.   Prepare to really ramp up the job search in late August. You honestly might not find the best position for yourself until then.   Network well and often. Lean on other classmates who have taken positions to keep an ear out for positions."
ECE,3649gj,msabre7,1 point,Sat May 16 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing, and I definitely agree with the financial aspect.   A similar aspect to that would be dating/family. Many of the opportunities for both work and school will require relocation, and so that makes it very difficult to make connections with people. Is your gf of 7 months going to move to another state with you when you decide to go back? Doubtful. If you're already married/committed, then it makes it very difficult for them to start a career, given that they will have to reset in a few years (and may not have opportunities where yours are). Same thing with friendships."
ECE,3649gj,andrewms,6,Sat May 16 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"Okay I graduated 2 years ago, worked a shit job ever since, and I am going back to school this fall. Here are my thoughts:   The only reason to do grad school is because you want to do research. Any other reason (i.e. unemployment, getting a fancy degree, etc.) is gonna bite you in the ass once you're in. In EE, esp. the areas that aren't embedded or software, doing a PhD is almost unnecessary now IF you do NOT want to be a professor. Keep in mind that out of 10 who apply for professorships at EE departments, only 3 get a job. If you cannot get a job with 3.4 GPA, and 3 co-op terms under your belt, there is something fundamentally wrong with your job search approach. Please get feedback on your cover letter and resume parts of your job applications. See the point below. Getting into a good and worthwhile PhD program is very much like getting a job. The only difference in the process is that you can track it, since you pay an application fee for it. But just like any other jobs, networking is the fastest way to get to it - i.e. if you have a personal connection established with a professor or a high-status student in the research group of your interest, your chances are extremely high to get into that program.   Profs can overrule departments. Students can recommend you for consideration to their Profs, or the ones that are in the admission committee. Do not underestimate this connection. You have to email them (or visit them even) to make this happen. A crap shoot strategy wouldn't get you anywhere.   Research in EE is not that exciting anymore. Make sure to look into other depts. as well. Seems like you should focus more on Computer Engineering groups, rather than EE groups. Groups define your research topic, and the Dept. they're in defines the title of your grad degree.   Hope this helps. Sorry about the messy formatting, I'm on phone."
ECE,3649gj,sepehrhm,1 point,Sat May 16 01:40:44 2015 UTC,"thanks for the reply  *I do want to do research. My capstone project was pretty much a research project but it was just a group of undergrads most of who were uninterested in the subject so I couldn't really pursue the research aspect of the project and we did something more applicable for the other EE's and CE's on the team. But I'm also afraid that I've made research like it will be the most amazing thing ever and it will end up being a huge disappointment when I get there.   *I have had thoughts about being a professors since that really appeals to me. but like you mentioned...the competition is what is also making me hesitant  *I've been being really picky with my jobs so it really is kind of my fault. I've been applying to jobs more research oriented that I hope would bolster my grad school app...but those have been difficult to find.  *Think it would be worth it to attend conferences for this?  *I'm thinking about looking into biomedical engineering programs too (biomedical signal processing and related is what i'm interested in). I think since I'm out of school finding a prof to network with might be the hardest...  Since you're going back to school, can I ask for what degree you're going back for and what program? And in your opinion do you think your previous job help/hurt your app?"
ECE,3649gj,sepehrhm,1 point,Sat May 16 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply.  It seems to me you really like research and wanna do grad school. Again let me emphasize this, having a strong connection with grad students and researchers goes way longer than any other component of your app.  So yeah, go to conferences, but go to meet a prof. You're interested in working with. Do your homework on their most recent publications, and be comfortable to discuss them in the most basic sense. Also, discovering what you have in common with a prof is super-beneficial e.g. u both went to Paris last summer, attended the same school, speak the same foreign language, etc. Conferences are great to expand your network.  I am gonna do EE again, just because I like the math, and I am doing a master's first so that I add research to my background (I'll think about PhD after completing my thesis). My previous job was only a concern when interviewing with profs. (3 in total) - they wanted to know why I'm leaving my job for grad school. I think your only worry would be explaining the gap you have in your professional timeline...  Gard school would be what you make of it. Good luck man :) PM me, I'll give u my email so that we'd be better in touch :)"
ECE,3649gj,dreyes,2,Sun May 17 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"My co ops were okay and I learned a lot but it just got so dull that I told myself I really wanted to go to grad school instead.   If this is your mindset, then you should consider the possibility that you are either working in the wrong sub-field of ECE or should not be in ECE at all. There are plenty of people with engineering majors that don't end up working in engineering, and that's ok.   I told myself I really wanted to go to grad school instead. I think I definitely romaticized the whole research track by making it seem as if I was going to save the world or become some world class expert and of course it's really just that type of thing I'm chasing.   I think you did romanticize it. As a grad student doing research, your job isn't doing research, per se, it's publishing research papers. No one sees the research you don't publish, so your first job is a writer. You do research so you have something interesting to write about.  So, here's my advice to you. Unless you know exactly why you want a Ph.D and enjoy doing research, do not do one. A Ph.D. requires a ton of work for several years in a job that usually isn't well respected for mediocre pay. The upside is that you usually have a lot of flexibility in work hours, etc. Most aspects of the job will depend heavily upon your adviser. Otherwise, getting an M.S. is a better option. You'll likely get to do some good research, and depending on your field, an M.S. may almost be mandatory to do anything interesting. Also, you usually don't have to commit more than 2 years to a M.S., so if you don't like it, you can leave after a reasonable amount of time.  For example, most new integrated circuit design position will require a M.S., and many require Ph.Ds. If you have a B.S., you will probably work in testing rather than design."
ECE,3649gj,gazagda,1 point,Tue May 19 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong guys :)  but the op can still go to grad school to update his/her computer engineering skills.Depending on the grad school, most allow you to do anything you want  your first year,(even undergrad courses) and then subsequent years they would make you have to ask for permission or get a form signed.You also have (again depending on the school) up to 5yrs to finish your masters , so plenty of time to do undergrad courses  and master classes.You also don't have to do a thesis some schools just make you take the FE, and/or a comprehensive oral to graduate.You can also still go for internships/co-ops while in grad school as well."

You will also probably be taking a selection of Computer Science classes, like programming, data structures, assembly language, operating systems, computer networks, etc.   You will also have some Electrical Engineering classes like signals and systems, digital circuits, analog circuits, and nonlinear circuits.

ECE,365598,gimpwiz,4,Sat May 16 22:24:23 2015 UTC,"I've worked at intel and more generally in chip design. CE is the way to go but EE and CS will work as well. The more important thing these days seems to be an advanced degree - even implementation, not just architecture, almost always wants an MS at minimum, at least in big companies.  Also, small companies almost can't do chip design anymore. The costs are very high and grow higher for every new process node (transistor size/topology.) So if you want to work in a small environment, chip design is hardly it. There are quite a few small outfits left but the numbers are shrinking every year."
ECE,365598,gimpwiz,1 point,Sun May 17 07:14:08 2015 UTC,"That's tough, so you basically would have to go straight to a big company like Intel. That will take some heavy work to prove to the company that they should take you but I am willing to work towards it after I get out of the Marines."
ECE,365598,gimpwiz,1 point,Mon May 18 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"On the plus side:   Most chip design companies recruit students heavily, and like hiring new grads (both undergraduate or graduate degrees) Most chip design companies know that students have literally zero real world experience and aren't expected to know much more than the basics There are combined thousands and thousands of jobs in chip design, and probably at least half of them are in various verification positions, which are a good fit for new grads   Cheat code: do internships. When you're an intern at a chip design house, they expect you to come in knowing literally nothing except for how to program, and the basics of digital logic design and computer architecture.  Examples of places you might want to work: Intel is the obvious one, because they're the biggest and have the reputation. But then there are the ones that do computers apart from Intel: namely, AMD and Nvidia. Now, moving on, there are a lot making baseband processors and mobile processors: Apple, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Samsung, and so on. Next, you have your memory vendors: Samsung, Hynix, Kingston, Micron. Don't forget Intel again, they do a ton more than just CPUs (storage, chipsets, ethernet, etc). You even have various specialty memory vendors such as Mosys. Next, you have your networking companies that make some ASICs here and there such as Cisco, Juniper, probably others. And of course, networking companies rely heavily on FPGA companies - Altera and Xilinx are the big ones, but you also have small ones like Lattice. And don't forget analog houses like Maxim. There are a lot of ARM upstarts, but many of them are folding... some are run by big companies (is LG still trying to make their own arm chips?); many have switched to only serving industrial applications (such as Texas Instruments.) But don't forget that these are all or almost all big chips, using leading-edge (N) or almost leading edge (N-1, N-2) processes; there are smaller chips out there that don't use super fancy tech but still run the world: your various microcontroller companies like TI, Atmel, Microchip (yes, that is their name), etc etc. And of course, there are some giants that refuse to die, like Oracle-Sun's SPARC chips (and Fuji's SPARC64) and IBM's POWER series. Oh, and don't forget your various Japanese vendors who may have both analog fabs (Canon, Sony) as well as developing ASICs for various uses (again, Canon for example makes their own camera image processor, as do some other camera manufacturers.) In addition, don't forget real silicon work you might do at the fabs/foundries (there are only four leading edge ones left - Intel, followed by Samsung, TSMC, and GlobalFoundries) as well as work in developing test chips for architecture licensing companies (ARM, Imagination) and working on soft IP.  In other words, there are probably 50 major companies doing what you're interested in, and probably still a hundred or more small ones, but the small ones are hard to find."
ECE,364u2w,whatupwhatup,4,Sat May 16 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), are simply different methods, by which communication devices can use to transmit/receive information with each other, without interfering with each other.   So for example, let's both of us are in a room with other people in a party. Let's also say that no one here can talk and listen at the same time. So if you are talking, you cant listen, and if you are listening, you cannot talk.   What are some rules we can come up with so that there is order in the way we communicate?  We can say ""Ok look, there are like 6 people in this party here, so we are going to give everyone here a 10 second slot every minute, by which they are allowed to talk, and everyone else has to listen. So person A gets the first 10 seconds, person B gets the next 10 seconds, person C gets the next 10 seconds, etc etc, until it's person A's turn again"". This is TDMA. We achieved multiple access through ""time division*. Hence, TDMA.   Ok, well let's now say that we have advanced a little bit: We can now both talk AND listen at the same time. And since we can do that, we dont want to play this round robin game. But the problem is that if I am talking, so can everyone else, and so even though I can also listen at the same time, I will be hearing EVERYONE's voices at the same time - how can I make sense of them all? They are all going to interfere with each other.   Ah! But what if embedded inside each person's ""voice"", there is an individual code, whereby if take know person A's code, I can use it to 'pull out' his words from all the clutter that I get. Similarly if I knew person B's code, then I could use that to pull out B's words from all the clutter. This is CDMA: I again have multiple access, but I am doing it through code division."

Your graduated friends who have jobs, most of their companies will pay them to get someone hired for a job there. They usually have internal application processes that push you to the top of the stack. I would highly recommend using linkedin to find friends that work at companies you want to work at and have them apply internally for you to work there (even if its at another office your friend doesnt work at)   Unless you're super lucky you're going to hate your first job and you're going to realize how little practical skills they taught you in school. (though I've heard that's changing...my junior design project was a joke compared to what you guys are doing now)   Finally, If you want to work in NYC you're going to realize unless you want to do software development/engineering you're not going to find work as an Electrical or Computer Engineer. There are simply too few companies and most of them don't have any opening for junior level engineers.   On the otherhand of working in NYC, if you do enjoy software engineering, you are in luck. its a HOT HOT HOT market.

Binghamton created a Watson Advising office where they try to help students from the Watson school connect with Alumni and network though not alot of people take advantage of it. I've tried a few times and it seemed a bit helpful but can be way better.   My professors are definitely out of touch with industry and yes BAE and Lockheed Martin keep popping up in career fairs and there's always a ginormous line for them that I end up wasting time waiting to speak to them only to have them tell me to apply online like the rest of the people. Apparently IBM is going through some layover so they were saying that they need more people. Ricoh finally made an appearance at the Spring semester fair which surprised me.  I keep my LinkedIn updated but I dont actually use it for job stuff so I will keep your advice in mind.  Yea in terms of strictly ECE opportunities I was really depressed for a while that I could not find virtually any opportunities at all in NYC. I had to put the pieces together to realize that NYC is basically Computer Science'y. Luckily I am interested in software development/engineering after liking my Data Structures course (CS 212) and am straying away from the hardcore hardware stuff but programming hardware is appealing to me as well. I say that last part because I know many if not most of the software jobs in the city have nothing to do with hardware at all (all those financial software jobs!) so even though I have an interest in software, Im scared to take that leap and let go of my affiliation with hardware with the Computer Engineering degree i am pursuing.  What also makes me doubt myself is that I pretty much no knowledge of object oriented programming and that term pops up everywhere in software job/internship postings for NYC. Bing's computer engineering curriculum focuses on the low level/hardware/fpga type stuff so my only qualification for the software engineering/developer jobs is from that one Data Structures course and that's it lol. I feel like pretty much every CS major knows a decent amount of Object oriented stuff and Data Structures stuff so why would I get picked over them.   Currently I am interning for a Defense company in Jersey in the software department. Last year I interned for the same company but in Systems Engineering specifically with RF stuff so hopefully things work out lol.

If you can take an introduction to SQL or Relational Databases course.

ECE,362eqd,dietlein,2,Fri May 15 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"As an electronics engineer I disagree with the implication that 80% working is good enough.   Yes, perfection is impossible but 80% working means that 1/5th of the functionality in your program or circuit is broken. Is that acceptable in a car? In an aeroplane? In a nuclear reactor? Doubt it.  Instead of throwing a number at it you need to work out what the point of diminishing returns is for your scenario.  If you are just banging out JavaScript for something that doesn't really matter then 80% is probably a good level."
ECE,362eqd,rand000m,4,Sat May 16 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"Is that acceptable in a car?    It was for decades.  Still is really,  at least,  if you're referring to safety.  We incrementally get better,  but only as the cost and benefits allow,  and we're still far from having a perfect car.  Cars can roll over.  Tires can blow out.  Objects can straight up pass through the thinner parts of your automobile.  Not to mention we use a fairly flammable fuel to drive the entire thing,  so they catch on fire from time to time.    Can we solve some of these problems?  Yes.  We could greatly reduce the tendency to roll,  but at great engineering cost in the utility and form of the vehicle.  We could use entirely different classes of materials for the tires,  but that would come at a very high price for the tires,  and less applicability to the wide types of road available in this country.    We could use very dense metal or carefully woven panels of carbon fiber to provide greater body rigidity and safety,  but the car will weigh a log more and get less MPG,  or will cost a huge amount to repair even in a minor fender bender.  This is what ""perfect is the enemy of good"" speaks to.  Your car isn't a car.  It's a collection of hundreds of individual systems that all have their own engineering trade offs..  and none of those parts are perfect."

ECE,362eqd,dietlein,2,Sat May 16 00:32:02 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I had a feeling there was some sort of cost analysis involved. They just hadn't sited any. Thanks!
ECE,362eqd,doodle77,10,Fri May 15 15:57:08 2015 UTC,The power factor of the plant is always changing with the loads on the motors. Too much capacitance and you'll end up with a leading power factor which costs just as much as if you had done nothing.
ECE,362eqd,bmnz,4,Fri May 15 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"Speaking off the top of my head, I think that instead of saying that ""95% provides maximum benefit"", it would be better phrased to say that ""95% provides power at a negligible amount of loss""."
ECE,362eqd,tacoThursday,2,Fri May 15 15:02:08 2015 UTC,it would be really odd and a little difficult to quantify the cost benefit of 95% v 100%. The difference is very little on the generator's part
ECE,362eqd,acstevens,5,Fri May 15 16:19:51 2015 UTC,All to do with costing - bigger capacitors = more money - not worth the return on investment
ECE,362eqd,tacoThursday,3,Fri May 15 16:03:29 2015 UTC,This sounds like mostly over simplification and possibly misunderstanding on the booklet's part.   To address the capacitor part. It's hard to even say that even in theory they could provide the required reactive support. There's not really any infinitely variable capacitor so the reactive support would come in discrete blocks as capacitors are placed on/off line. Each time one is placed on/off it would cause a transient.  I've worked in the power industry specifically with transmission and voltage control and can think of no reason what so ever why 95% provides a maximum benefit. It seems like there may be a misunderstanding on the concept of power factor correction. Generators are typically rated for full load and 0.95 pf.  Maybe that's what they meant. but 0.95 pf is not the same as 95% power factor correction. I don't really even understand what they mean by 95% power factor correction. 95% of what. You're right. 100% would be best. Otherwise where is the other 5% coming from?  Feel free to ask more on this subject. I had a bunch more typed out but realized it wasn't really answering the question and being pedantic. I work specifically with this stuff so it's my jam.
ECE,362eqd,tacoThursday,2,Fri May 15 16:18:22 2015 UTC,I loved this stuff in class. I guess their nomenclature of 95% (at least they use it constantly when referring to the power factor) is what I would call 0.95. I just hasn't heard of that being most beneficial before. Just threw me off :/
ECE,362eqd,BobCollins,1 point,Fri May 15 23:24:21 2015 UTC,then they have a misunderstanding of pf then. If they're using 95% to mean 0.95 pf then it certainly doesn't mean it's supplying 95% of the reactive power. At 0.95 pf a generator is not delivering a lot of reactive supply.   There's really no such thing as an optimal reactive output. You could make the case (and several utilities do) that because they're not being paid to produce reactive power that they operate at unity (1.0 pf) in which case they're not providing or consuming any reactive power. But by their logic 1 pf is 100 reactive supply which is not correct.   They've got something incorrect
ECE,362eqd,mantrap2,3,Sat May 16 00:10:11 2015 UTC,"power factor correction to approximately 95% provides maximum benefit.   Poor wording. As others have said, a 95% goal may be appropriate, but it is not technically ""maximum."""

You need a chip like the MAX232 (or the dozens of similar devices) that will translate the voltage levels and create the higher voltage supplies.  Unless you like tinkering with a soldering iron, you might as well just buy a USB serial port that has all of that in one unit.

ECE,35voso,supafupa,2,Thu May 14 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"Rather than list your skills and experience as a list of bullet items, I would describe some designs you have done. e.g. ""Designed a 10 kV laser power supply. Simulated the design using LTSpice, supervised the layout, built and tested prototypes, and supported manufacturing."" By doing that, you demonstrate some skills in a credible manner.  Avoid using adjectives like ""Result driven"", ""high impact"", ""dynamic"". These take up space and mean nothing, really. Demonstrate how clever you are by talking about what you've done.  When listing your skills and experience, you don't have to include everything. Stick to the more significant stuff. Drop or minimize lesser things. The Skillset section seems especially cluttered."
ECE,35twe3,Intuiton,29,Wed May 13 13:56:57 2015 UTC,"After my first two years I found myself with a ~2.2, right before the upper level courses kicked in so it was only uphill from there. I fell into a mild depression for a couple months, doubting if I even belonged in an engineering program. After researching other majors that I might want to switch to (all of which didn't resonate with me like EE did), I came to the conclusion that I was in the right area of study after all, and that my lack of success was not taking time to really understand the material. I decided that what's done is done, and all I could do is put forth my best effort going forward.  I ended up graduating with a 2.7, and while it did limit my opportunities (I never was even able to land an internship), I found an automation controls company that was willing to take a chance on me. Coming up on three and a half years and several raises later, my GPA is a distant memory.  You'll be fine. Just stay focused, cultivate your work ethic, and maintain a drive to learn new things. Somebody will notice."
ECE,35twe3,Dendaman,8,Wed May 13 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to me.  I was even directly asked why I only had a 2.8.  It was a good opportunity to show my improvement in upper level classes.

I pointed out that I struggled with some Calc, Bio and Physics courses my first couple of years but did well on the upper-division EE courses and my technical electives. They have since asked me to come in for an in-person interview. The point is that having a low GPA is definitely not a deal breaker, especially if you can show that you did well in your Engineering courses!"

I've never been stupid, so I started studying harder, all in the hopes I could beat my friends test scores.  Each test was a new race between us all.  This continued through my undergraduate career.  I brought my major GPA up to 3.5 and managed to get into grad school where I'm currently working on my PhD in nanoelectronics.  Good luck and don't give up."

ECE,35twe3,mastrepolo,2,Thu May 14 06:22:44 2015 UTC,Try to get a good understanding of transistors and how they operate (in the device physics way).  There should be at least one course in your school for that.  Any semiconductor physics courses would be helpful to help you understand how to use materials for possibly new devices.  Fabrication courses will teach you how to make the materials useful and understand the processes that are used in the field.  Material science courses are also pretty valuable for introductory learning such as crystal structures and material phenomena.    Hyperphysics has some good intro material that I use to refresh myself sometimes http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/semcn.html

ECE,35twe3,kjchowdhry,3,Wed May 13 18:48:00 2015 UTC,I did very poorly my first 2 years and had essentially straight As through my electrical engineering courses so I wound up with a 3.0 at graduation. I'm currently working on my PhD so GPA isn't everything. Towards the end of your degree you can do very little to change your GPA since you have so many credits behind you so all you can do is own it and drive on. I know people who have graduated with worse GPAs and gone on to work for companies like Apple so hope is not lost. If you have a poor GPA you need to make it a top priority to get an internship (or research position if you want to go to grad school) even if it means delaying graduation.

ECE,35twe3,ikahjalmr,3,Wed May 13 15:00:57 2015 UTC,I had a particularly rough time during my undergraduate.   Like similar stories here I began battling depression resulting in a tanking GPA.   I ended up graduating with two engineering degrees at around a 2.7.  I'm now working as an engineer for the German Aerospace Center in Deutschland.  My advice to you is focus on forward momentum.   Don't worry about the big picture.   Take each day as it comes and make progress by completing each days tasks.   Before you know it you will be preparing for graduation and your GPA will be a distant memory.

ECE,35twe3,Digitalzombie90,3,Wed May 13 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"This might be lost in the comments but I hope it helps someone out. This is meant more as an encouragement post than a low GPA success story.  Success can be attributed to intelligence, but I believe it's achieved by adaptation, figure out what works for you. At the end of my sophomore year I had a 3.09 GPA, which I was happy about but I knew I wanted to do better. The next quarter I received a really good GPA and it drug my 3.1 up to a 3.3. This was encouraging; I developed different study habits and now at the end of my junior year I have a 3.50. Here's how:  Understand what works for you and be realistic about it. Do you have trouble studying at home? Go to campus. Is it hard for you to go back to campus after eating? Pack a lunch. These may seem obvious but it's easy to ignore them because it's more comfortable to delay studying. Do you work well in groups or alone? Adapt. Objectively experiment with your social and professional (student) life to see what works.   Start your homework sooner. This also may seem obvious, but it's really hard to do, be realistic about it and figure out how to get motivated earlier. Do the homework to learn, not to get the answer. If you have the answer but don't understand one simple step, go back and figure out why! Ask someone or GOOGLE IT. I can't stress this enough, don't skip out on learning something just because you managed to get the answer.   If this isn't relevant to you because you're graduating this year, carry the information into your professional life. After a few years, GPA becomes irrelevant. If you learn how to continuously adapt to achieve your goals, you will do great."

My cumulative had dropped to a 2.49 and my in major gpa was a 1.77.   My next four semesters were 3.46, 2.8, 3.08 3.55 respectively. This brought my cum gpa from the 2.49 to a 2.71. And my in major went from a 1.77 to a 2.75.   You can do it and don't worry if you show good work ethic and have a good attitude there are multiple companies will be looking at."
ECE,35twe3,CaptainMarnimal,3,Wed May 13 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"The best advice I have for you is to only advertise your GPA on your resume IF it's a GPA you can be proud of.  Try to sell yourself with your experiences, and then only talk about your GPA if asked. Try to point out that the reason your GPA is relatively low is because you chose to challenge yourself with difficult curriculum as a means of becoming a better, more well rounded, engineer.   Oh, and get some internship experience under your belt."
ECE,35twe3,dsargent,2,Wed May 13 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Once you get into College, nobody cares about your HS GPA. Once you get your first job, nobody cares about your College GPA Once you get your second job, nobody cares about where you went to college...etc...   That's the best advice I can give anyone who stresses about their GPA.    As someone who's staffed engineering job fairs, and as someone who had a 2.08GPA at graduation, I don't really care what your GPA is as long as you go to an interview and do these few things:  1) You know how to converse, look me in the eye when talking to me, and aren't terribly awkward.  Even these things can be taught, so if you're not good at them, it's not a deal breaker. 2) Highlight what classes you took, what your interests are, and how much work experience you've had, even if you were a lifeguard or worked at a Best Buy. If you haven't got much/anything, it's going to be very difficult to say ""yeah, I'm going to take a chance on this person."" 3) Research the company you're talking to.  I had so many graduating students, and even people in the field who are just looking for a ""job"" and not a ""Career.""  Know your employer more than the hiring manager does.  4) Ask a ton of questions.  Listen to what the interviewer tells you about the company, but then ask them questions related. I'm more willing to hire someone who's interested than someone who is sitting there pretending to listen and waiting nervously for a question.    If you have a low GPA, don't put it on your resume. I may be in the minority, but I really don't care what your GPA is even if it's high.  Frankly, someone with a high GPA might get super bored at most jobs.   It's a hit or miss proposition.  They can always ask you later.   TL;DR :  GPA doesn't really matter as much as who you are, your personality and experiences. Leave it off, score the interview through research and interest, and get the job with confidence."

Honestly, anything above a 3.0 looks pretty good to most employers. Keep working hard, bud. And, most importantly, don't sell yourself short.

While I escaped probation within the next couple of semesters, I really didn't hit my stride till my third year when the courses started getting interesting thanks to all the electives I was taking.    What my subsequent employers noticed when going through my transcripts -- which my bosses eventually told me -- was the fact that I did well in the courses that mattered to them and that they saw an improvement in academic performance with each passing year. They took that as a sign of maturity and the development of better study habits, so they decided to overlook the abysmal GPA I had from my first two years in college."
ECE,35twe3,Falmarri,2,Wed May 13 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"I seriously cannot understand how grades are that important in the U.S. Imo, it says very little about you. When applying for jobs in Norway, most companies wont even bother looking at your grades, and if they do, they mostly want to check that you don't have all D's.  I'm not sure what the grade average is in engineering at my school, but I think it is around a C, maybe a little under (Norwegian schools have A B C D E F, as grades). Im sure the grade percentages are different and ways of testing are different.  Either way, there are people in my class with higher GPAs than me, who have not found a job because they don't function as well socially, and it is hard for them to see the connection between classes.  Grades mostly say how good you are at cramming for tests and not how well you understand the bigger picture of things.

ECE,35twe3,jackbalt,1 point,Wed May 13 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"First, 3.1 is not low for an engineer in any regard. If you feel it's low it's because you are being self conscious because you are having trouble with prospects. The key is not what your GPA is, but who you know. Networking is the most important thing you can do when finding a job. Find someone who can hand your resume right to the person in charge.  Second, I graduated with a 2.76 in Electrical Engineering. Met an alumni my sophomore year  and continued the relationship. When senior year came around I was already ahead of many others because I was confident and comfortable when talking to him. He is a partner at my current company and one of my bosses. I'm working I the financial district of NYC designing the electrical power for skyscrapers. It's all about who you know. If you rely on your GPA to get you a job you will end up as a cog in a giant machine, a number cruncher. Talk to people and find a personably person who works in an area you want. Unless they ask you if you want a job right of the bat, grow your relationship with the person before asking. That's what worked for me."

A balun can be just for the former, just for the latter or both, or neither (e.g. impedance matching by another method).  The frequency decides what particular implementation is used/best.  There are ""wound transformer baluns"" which are generally for below ~250MHz.  These are usually wrong a ferrite or high mu core.  Being actual inductors, they have upper bounds one frequency performance.    There are transmission line baluns for higher frequencies.  There are also ""hybrid baluns"" which use a combination of both to cover low and high frequency ranges.  A balun is a two-port, is a filter.   As a filter, impedance matching is a result of two-port ""impedance mirroring"" which transforms the impedance seen on the other side.   So baluns have the same challenges as broadband matching filters - one frequency or a narrow band is relatively easy; broadband is tricky and seldom perfectible below a certain mismatch/insertion-loss/flatness.  For resonant frequency and general frequency response, you use an LCR meter (measuring 1-port impedance with open/short loads) or impedance analyzer (measuring Z- or Y-parameters) at lower frequencies and vector network analyzer at higher frequencies (measuring s-parameters)."

ECE,35syhm,moosemoose41,3,Wed May 13 06:28:00 2015 UTC,"Alright. Talking about BIG.little. I am going to use Intel terminology for power states. C states (idle states) and P states (functional states). Something to keep in mind when talking about BIG.little is that the cores are coherent w.r.t memory and IO but do not share caches at any level.  In a traditional approach when a core has no work to do it is moved into C1 where the core is clock gated. It does not lose state but continues to leak. When all the cores in a complex are halting the whole complex can be shut down along with architecture shared among the cores like clock drivers and system caches. They are waked up by an interrupt from a system controller. In low IPC workloads this happens frequently with burst-y behavior in-between. This transitions the cores into P states that are largely dependent on how threaded you are to allocate TDP among the various cores.   The idea of BIG.little is that if you make a graph of theoretical workload IPC vs energy per operation you will have a crossover point somewhere on that graph where your big core uses more energy per operation than your little core. At this point, for a fixed workload, you would be better served by the smaller core. This crossover point is created because the leakage for the bigger core and the larger clocked speculative structures that basically have to be written to every cycle are wasting power when there isn't really much work done. However, for workloads where the theoretical IPC of the code is high there is plenty of work to keep the big core busy the speculative structures are generally getting things right at a very high rate (and saving power at that) and the leakage is favorable compared to the small core because once the work is done we are powering down. At these high IPC compute bound workloads the big core has better instruction energy efficiency than the small core (however at the very top of the workload IPC curve this energy/instruction drops off, but this is at IPCs that the little core cannot touch)   BIG.little's philosophy is to take this point and context switch at it. Power down the big core and switch to the less leaky structure with less elements that need be clocked and do it without sacrificing any or much real IPC. This is possible because the workload isn't compute bound and there isn't much for the super-scalar core to do.   This basically doesn't work in any current implementation; but octo-core smartphone is super rad marketing:    When you power down a core you lose all of it's state. The context switch to slow->fast/fast->slow is expensive. While it may have made some sense bulk process but FinFets have much better leakage characteristics. Clock gating saves much of the power and the expensive context switch shifts the crossover point even further down. Getting the software right is VERY device dependent. Leakage is a huge metric in figuring out when to switch. Turns out leakage is highly dependent on temperature and process variation among other difficult things.    There are lots of other reasons... It turns out it is really difficult to build a nearly asynchronous processor with super effective clock gating. However, from my point of view, it is the less wasteful way to build a low power high performance system.       tests have showed basically no benefit for BIG.little in current implementation. Having never worked with big.Little and having no intention to, i'll still say this could probably be improved."

ECE,35nwwi,snoop911,4,Tue May 12 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"Good question! So here's the deal: (and Mr. Wilson at TI glosses over a few important details; Mr. Sachs at Microchip will now correct a few of them)  The short answer is that the load torque, and the inertia of motor and load, determine the rotation direction and are influenced by the voltage you apply.  The long answer:   You (and by ""you"" I mean the controller determining the PWM outputs) are outputting a voltage between +Vdc and -Vdc across two of the three motor terminals, the other one being left unenergized. The motor itself generates a voltage which is quasi-sinusoidal (closer to trapezoidal for motors being sold with trapezoidal backemf; closer to sinusoidal for motors being sold with sinusoidal backemf).  The difference between those voltages appears across the motor resistance and inductance, and causes the motor winding current to change. Motor winding current then causes electromagnetic torque, and the deal with proper six-step commutation is that the angle theta between the magnetic field caused by the stator winding current, and the rotor magnetic field, is always within 30 degrees of the optimal +/- 90 degrees. Torque = Ke6 * I * cos theta_offset, where Ke6 is the six-step torque constant, and theta_offset is within the +/- 30 range for proper six-step commutation. That means you get somewhere between 86.6% and 100% of optimal torque. The net torque, which is the difference between the electromagnetic torque and the load torque causes the motor to accelerate or decelerate. (positive torque in the positive direction, and negative torque in the negative direction; whether it's CW or CCW depends on how the motor is wound.) If the motor is unloaded (e.g. the only load torque is Coulomb friction and viscous damping) and the current is enough to overcome Coulomb friction, then you will eventually get motion in the same direction as current; this direction, in turn, because of the L and R dynamics will eventually (within a few L/R time constants, typically in the millisecond range) be the same as the difference in applied voltage. (Mr. Wilson's article misses those eventuallys, as well as some of the nuances of back-EMF behavior within a commutation step: ""As long as the average applied motor voltage is of the same polarity as the motor’s back-EMF voltage, and it is greater in amplitude than the back-EMF, then the motor will operate in motoring mode."")   So voltage difference between applied voltage and instantaneous back-EMF influences current, current controls electromagnetic torque, net torque controls the rate of change of velocity.  If you're doing servo control of six-step commutation (which has its place, not as high-performance as field-oriented control, but not as complicated), then what you do is to control the current as a function of the commutation step, rather than the voltage. The commutation table will tell you which current to use in order to get near-optimum positive torque: for example, step 0 = A → B (current out of phase A and into phase B), step 1 = A → C, step 2 = B → C, step 3 = B → A, step 4 = C → A, step 5 = C → B. (Your motor may define these steps in a different order, but you'll note that the phases always follow a pattern: step N+3 reverses the phases from step N, and each phase is active for two adjacent steps.) To get negative torque you just invert the sign of the current. You control current by applying a voltage, and you determine that voltage using a control loop (e.g. a P-I controller) to drive the current error between desired and measured current to zero.  But the point is, you have no direct control over which order the 6 step sequence is executed. You're supposed to pay attention to hall sensors that tell you which step you should be using. Otherwise you will make poor use of the current capability you have. If the motor rotates CW, you switch steps in one direction; if the motor rotates CCW you switch steps in the other direction. If a person grabs onto the motor shaft and overcomes the motor torque to make it spin one way, then the other, that will determine the order of the sequence, not the motor controller (which again, is supposed to be using the commutation step dictated by the hall sensors).   Now, if I don't care about servo control and I don't care about keeping the current tightly controlled, then what I can do is take that commutation table and use it to transform a DC differential duty cycle and apply that to the two active motor phases.   You're going to read that sentence and think ""WTF is he talking about?"" Well, here's an example. Let's say I want to apply +50% Vdc across the motor (positive in the sense that I want positive torque which will eventually give me positive speed for an unloaded motor), and my commutation table is the one listed earlier, and I'm in step 0 = A → B, so positive torque results from current out of phase A and into phase B. To help cause that positive current to flow, I'd want my phase A voltage to be higher than phase B. So I take my differential duty cycle (+50%) and calculate duty cycles: A = 75% (upper transistor at approximately 75%, lower at approximately 25% or left off so the diode conducts when the upper transistor is off; I'm neglecting deadtime for the purposes of this discussion), B = 25%, so the difference between A and B duty cycle is 50%. I do the same thing for the other 5 commutation steps. For an unloaded motor, this +50% will tend to give positive speed with the back-EMF corresponding to more or less half of Vdc. (Minor errors are caused by inductive voltage drops in the motor windings, and other 2nd-order effects.) If I want the motor to rotate in the other direction, I use a differential duty cycle of -50% Vdc and choose A = 25%, B = 75%.  Caring about voltage only, and ignoring the current has its tradeoffs. It's easier, but it puts more electrical stress on the motor and transistors, because you can get high current transients if you're not careful and you change the applied voltage in rapid steps. A current control loop with an outer speed control loop alleviates those problems but is more complicated. (And sinusoidal FOC more complicated still, but you get less torque ripple and slightly higher efficiency.)  If you're using a sensorless controller then you don't have hall sensors, and you do this dance between open-loop commutation in the order you want, and closed-loop commutation using the voltage measured on the unenergized phase.  None of the motor controller semiconductor manufacturers really does a good job explaining proper six-step control; when I get a chance, maybe I'll write up an appnote, but what I've stated above covers most of it.  Hope this helps!"
ECE,35nwwi,jms_nh,1 point,Tue May 12 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks that helps quite a bit!  It's still slowly sinking in, but if I understand correctly, the NET VOLTAGE across the motor produced by the the bipolar switching, will move the motor in a particular direction, and so the next commutation step must follow its lead in order to keep the motor spinning.  (Max speed will be when pwm duty cycle is 0% or 100%)  By contrast, with unipolar switching, the current can only flow from a high side phase to a low side phase that is energize at the time of commutation.  i.e the direction is fixed based on this coil selection.  (Max speed will be when pwm duty cycle is 100%)  If thats correct, how does the back-emf fit into this?  For example, it's often said that bipolar switching is preferrable for sensorless applications due to the better back-emf response.     Why wouldn't the back-emf response be the same between when driving with unipolar (i.e. maximum current)?  The other implication about bipolar that has me thinking, is that what happens if your power supply can't handle a net negative current (regeneration)?    Does this eliminate bipolar as an option or can the reverse current be safely removed?"
ECE,35nwwi,jms_nh,1 point,Wed May 13 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"Choice of switching technique really doesn't change things much. Again, let's say you're in step 0 = A → B, and you want a +40% differential duty cycle. (not +50% because it makes the math a little clearer.)  To achieve this, one choice for ""unipolar switching"", as you call it, is to turn phase A high side on fully (100%) and then turn phase B on at 60% (remember, this is from the high side switch's perspective, so turn switch phase B low at approx 40% and let phase B high conduct through the diode). But keeping a high-side switch on for long periods of time won't work with a bootstrap gate drive, so most people use the other possibility:  Turn phase B low on continuously (this achieves a phase B duty cycle of 0%), turn phase A high on at 40% duty cycle.  Again, all you're looking for is to achieve a particular voltage difference across a particular pair of phase terminals. How you get there depends on the switching technique, but you get the same result.   For example, it's often said that bipolar switching is preferrable for sensorless applications due to the better back-emf response. Why wouldn't the back-emf response be the same between when driving with unipolar (i.e. maximum current)?   The only real differences between the switching techniques are:   how many transistors are actively switching at the PWM frequency -- this controls switching loss vs. conduction loss. ""Unipolar"" switching is simpler and has lower switching loss. ""Bipolar"" switching has anywhere from 2-4 transistors switching at the PWM frequency. If you use 2 transistors switching, you rely on the diodes to conduct the freewheeling current, and conduction loss is higher. If you use 4 transistors switching, you rely on the MOSFETs to conduct freewheeling current, and conduction loss is lower. (IGBTs don't conduct reverse current so it goes through the diodes anyway.) current ripple -- optimum here is to switch all 4 transistors in the active two phases, using center-aligned PWM. Treat it like an H-bridge and read my articles about H-bridges. discontinuous conduction -- if you use the diodes for freewheeling conduction rather than the transistors, then things change if the current drops to zero, and the voltage on a phase can float to something that depends on the back-EMF. If you want to control the applied voltage more precisely, switch all the transistors on the active phases. average (zero-sequence) voltage -- the line-to-line voltages are what the motor cares about, so you have some freedom to move the average voltage of the 3 terminals up and down (see my article on ZSM). I don't know why ""bipolar switching is preferrable for sensorless applications due to the better back-emf response"". The voltage on the third phase depends on the back-emf and the voltages you apply to the other two phases. If you pull the two active phases up higher, the third phase voltage will also be higher and you have to take that into account for back-emf sensing for sensorless applications.    what happens if your power supply can't handle a net negative current (regeneration)?    You have this issue with any switching technique. Either the current flows through the diodes or through your transistors, but either way you have to worry about regeneration. If you don't provide a place for the energy to go, it will charge up your DC link capacitors until something is destroyed."
ECE,35nwwi,Bradm77,1 point,Wed May 13 13:39:48 2015 UTC,Question for you.  Are there any good books that cover PMSM and BLDC control techniques?  I design brushless and induction motors and most machine design books do a horrible job on the control side of things.
ECE,35nwwi,jms_nh,1 point,Wed May 13 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Are there any good books that cover PMSM and BLDC control techniques?   Are there any great books: no, and that makes me want to write one (but probably won't happen until I retire or my work queue gets a lot less full). The books that are out there tend to fall into two categories:   Academic textbooks full of equations and derivations, that rarely separate the mess of equations from the end summary, and often lack a discussion practical issues. The best of these include Novotny & Lipo (Vector Control and Dynamics of AC Drives, there's a newer edition out but I don't know the title), and Krause/Wasynczuk/Sudhoff, which are worth having if you don't mind wading through the equations. Crap books for beginners that are somewhat useful, but contain many nuggets of bad advice. (Anything by Irving Gottlieb.) The least bad of these, in my opinion, is the Motor Control Electronics Handbook by Richard Valentine. My copy got borrowed and never returned, so I can't look at my red pen notes to tell you where the errors are.   The rare exception to these is Ned Mohan's books. They don't cover everything, but they strike a pretty good balance. The equations aren't overwhelming and yet he relies on a strong theoretical background.  Alternatively you can look at the appnotes available from the semiconductor companies. Ours (Microchip's) are ok (we know they need improvement), so are TI's and Freescale's. Renesas doesn't have good appnotes IMHO and they actually plagiarized one of ours. Analog Devices had a good online seminar once but I think they took it off their website."
ECE,35nwwi,Bradm77,1 point,Wed May 13 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I have found app notes to be helpful.  And I've seen Novotny and Lipo around but haven't had a chance to look at it.  Lipo's AC machine design book is a standard for induction motor design.  I'll have to check out Mohan's books.  I actually did find some videos on youtube by Dave Wilson at TI that were helpful.  Very surface level stuff but he explained the overall concepts of FOC very well, I thought."
ECE,35nwwi,jms_nh,1 point,Wed May 13 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"I design brushless and induction motors   Any insight from your end is certainly welcome. Motors to me are a black box. Once I get a datasheet I can use them, but don't ask me how the design process works. The only thing I know how to do is tweak the # of turns given a particular rotor/stator design in order to match the voltage and current requirements. Oh, and that four-pole motors are usually more efficient than two-pole motors.  How do motor power and torque ratings scale? (e.g. torque = K * radius2 * length? vague memories of Maxwell stress tensors come wafting back from one college course.)  OH: and I have to pass on one more thing. Motor manufacturers generally do a really lousy job of explaining the specs in their data sheets. Please please please put some information about what you mean by torque constant, back-emf, L, R. Is it line-to-line, RMS, zero-peak, under what conditions is it measured/tested, etc. Torque constant is the worst (six-step? FOC? does Nm/A mean RMS current or peak amplitude?) and I usually ignore it altogether in favor of using back-emf constant directly. And use metric! If you want to include oz-in or lb-ft to help out legacy customers go ahead, but the engineering world would save a huge amount of time if we could just use metric in our calculations."
ECE,35nwwi,Bradm77,2,Wed May 13 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"The best books on brushless motor design are by Hanselmann (Brushless Motors: Magnetic Design, Performance, and Control) and Hendershot/Miller (Design of Brushless Permanent-Magnet Machines).  The former is a more introductory text, the later is more advanced.      tweak the # of turns given a particular rotor/stator design in order to match the voltage and current requirements   The general rule of thumb is if you want to double the voltage and half the current, you double the number of turns and decrease the cross-sectional area in half, which ends up being 3 wire gauges.  You will get almost identical performance at double voltage.   Oh, and that four-pole motors are usually more efficient than two-pole motors.   Very often, yes, but it really depends on the motor topology.  To make an efficient motor is to reduce the losses as much as possible.  The main losses in a motor are copper losses, core losses, friction and windage and a few others.  Copper losses make up the majority of the losses in a machine, followed by core losses.  Copper losses are obviously dependent on current and resistance, core losses are dependent on the type of steel, the flux density and the electrical frequency of the motor.  (This is why more efficient motors are generally bigger - they need bigger wire and bigger laminations to keep the current density and flux density lower).    The reason higher pole count motors are often more efficient (especially induction motors) has to do with the end turns of the stator.  Higher # of poles = less end turns = less copper losses.  End turns do no useful work in a machine and in a 2 pole motor the end turns have to stretch 180 mechanical degrees and to physically insert them in the slots you often have to make them a little bigger than you would with a 4 pole motor.  This becomes less of a concern with brushless motors that have concentrated windings around a single tooth.    Higher pole counts also increase the electrical frequency (for a given mechanical speed) and as I mentioned above, that increases core losses.  But at the same time the flux density in the back iron decreases so you can often increase the slot area which allows more wire to fit which helps your efficiency.     How do motor power and torque ratings scale? (e.g. torque = Kradius2length? vague memories of Maxwell stress tensors come wafting back from one college course.)   Basically, yes, power and torque scale with rotor volume.  Output power is proportional to the square of the air gap diameter and the length of the rotor.  It is also proportional to excitation frequency, so for constant power as speed goes up, rotor volume can go down.  And this really only holds for similar motor designs (similar cooling, similar magnets, similar slot fill, etc.).     Motor manufacturers generally do a really lousy job of explaining the specs in their data sheets.    Agreed.  There really is no industry standard and rarely is it explained on datasheets.  We (motor industry) do a poor job of this in general.  I think part of the problem is that for brushed PM motors, you didn't really have to worry about whether those values were peak/RMS or phase/line-to-line.  And when BLDC motors came along they were meant to have similar characteristics to brushed PM motors and the datasheets didn't really reflect the differences.     Torque constant is the worst ... and I usually ignore it altogether in favor of using back-emf constant directly   Agreed.  This would be my advice.  I don't like Kt.  My preferred method of communicating what Kt is supposed to be is a graph of torque vs RMS current (specified with the type of drive used) because it shows the effects of friction at no load and the effects of saturation at high current.  I've seen too many times where it is just assumed that Kt = Ke when in reality it never is the same.     And use metric!   Yeah ... this will never change.  Sorry.  To be honest, this doesn't even bother me any more.  In machine design I have to deal with 3 systems of measurement: SI units, CGS units, and english units.  I've seen flux density measured in webers/m3 , gauss, and lines/in2.  Coercivity will be in oersteds on a neodymium magnet datasheet but in Amp-turns/in on an electrical steel datasheet."

ECE,35nwwi,Armestam,1 point,Thu May 14 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"I don't recall where I read that complimentary bipolar should be used in place of unipolar for sensorless driving..  it was something along the lines that a single shunt can sense the narrow current pulses better (no circulating current in the floating phase) and that since the zero volt point is at a 50% duty cycle, it has more time to sense the BEMF.    If I find the link I'll edit, thanks!  edit : Found it! ""The complementary switching can be implemented in a bipolar or unipolar manner. The unipolar switching leads to lower switching losses and current ripple. However, from a back-EMF perspective, the bipolar switching is the better choice because this allows a duty cycle in the range of 50 percent to 100 percent. It significantly simplifies the back-EMF voltage and current sensing...several assumptions must be considered during the ADC sampling implementation. The first limiting factor is the choice of PWM modulation. From this perspective, the complementary bipolar switching is the best choice. This PWM switching can be implemented so the duty cycle is in the range of 50 percent to 100 percent at any time of motor operation. It gives a good condition for ADC sampling because at least 1/4 of the PWM period is available for ADC sampling. With unipolar switching, the duty cycle starts from 0 percent. This means that there is a limit on ADC sampling at narrow pulses, regardless of whether hardware synchronization is available. In this case, a different sensing method must be chosen, where the back-EMF voltage is compared to zero instead of half DC-bus voltage"" http://cache.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/ref_manual/DRM086.pdf"

What you want to do is make sure the switching pattern lets current flow through shunt resistors, whether it's single shunt, or one shunt in each of two or three legs. I'm not sure it's any better with ""bipolar"" than ""unipolar"", unless it's using edge-aligned PWM. (Center-aligned PWM would split the time interval into half, and that probably hurts.)"

Do this for a semester or a year and then start looking for a research position by your sophomore year. Then get an internship between your sophomore and junior year and you're ahead of the game.

FPGA's are REALLY fun, and hardware design is a really eye-opening experience, but you have to understand that vendor lock in is all part of the game and no one is changing that anytime soon.  It's like asking companies to make open-source DSP chips or open-source graphics procesors. It would be awesome if they did, but no one seriously expects either of these to happen anytime soon because vendors jealously guard their firmware and architectures.  Eventually, someday, someone will make an open source FPGA and an open source toolkit (the hardware needs to be there because reverse-engineering the data format for an FPGA is nigh on impossible at the moment), but that time is sufficiently far away that if you're serious about learning FPGAs,  you're just gonna have to go for it and deal with the obvious philosophical issues."

ECE,35i9u5,hardolaf,2,Wed May 13 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"The bigger problem isn't bitstream format, it's timing.  It's theoretically possible to reverse engineer the bitstream. On a modern device that possibility is highly theoretical, but it's been done on some of the older families still available.  However it's not theoretically possible to reverse engineer the timing specifications. Not without sample silicon and a lot of time and money.  Without the timing specifications you'd have to make extremely conservative estimates about delays, setup and hold windows in order to produce a reliable bit stream. Your design will run at a fraction of the speed that it would if synthesized with the commercial tools."

I really should get one of these ICE40s to play around with. It should be very possible--setup time for example--to hook up two clocks who are out of phase by a known value to two internal state elements with a sample circuit between them and observing how out of phase the clock can be while still meeting setup timing on that path. Using this you should be able to produce delay tables for various signal routes and LUTs.

I'm meeting with my PI tomorrow to discuss this unfortunate situation and have me move over to be a fully funded graduate student.  Just a recommendation, just because you can use variables, don't unless it's for something trivial like a counter. You really don't want to know how most tools treat variables in HDL.

ECE,35j536,ConCurTurtle64,5,Sun May 10 21:51:41 2015 UTC,"This sounds like you're working with LC3...  MAR stands for memory address register, while MDR stands for memory data register. I'm sure you know that with memory, you throw in an address, and it spits out the data at that address. This is where the MAR/MDR come in handy.  If you want to read to a memory address, you store the memory address into the MAR, and some time period later, the data stored at that memory address is put into the MDR. So if data xDEAD is stored at location xBEEF and we wish to access that data, we put xBEEF into the MAR, and the data xDEAD is stored into the MDR  If you want to write data into a memory location, you put the address into the MAR and the data you want to write into the MDR. Then the memory puts the MDR into the location of the MAR. So if you want to store xDEAD into the location xBEEF, you put xDEAD into the MAR and xBEEF into the MAR, then the memory will perform a store.  If this is an architectural problem, you also need to set the memory control signals to perform the right operation depending on the opcode (set read signals for a read, and write signals for a write)."

ECE,35gqvm,atapel,9,Sun May 10 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"The Original Poster /u/atapel is right.  The book is wrong.  The given stimulus function Vs(t) is a sawtooth wave whose period is 1.0 seconds and which ramps from 0v to 6v.  You can either deduce this by inspection, or, if you're skeptical like me, you can put the first nine terms into an Excel spreadsheet and make a plot.  Voila, you get this .  Anyone can see it is a sawtooth that ramps from 0V to 6V in 1 second.  It is plain and apparent that the average of this sawtooth is 3 volts.  Therefore the single pole RC lowpass filter in Figure 17.22 should produce a waveform that oscillates around the average value, 3 volts.  A skeptical person like me could input the circuit schematic into the LTSPICE circuit simulator software, and study its behavior.  LTSPICE is a free download BTW.  The circuit simulation results show exactly what you would expect.  The 6 volt peak-to-peak sawtooth input {green waveform, top panel}, gets lowpass filtered and becomes a 3 volt dc waveform with some ripple {blue waveform, bottom panel}.  Be sure to double click the figure and view it in its own browser window.  View it at full screen resolution so you can read the legends and see the waveforms clearly.

Using a servo, stepper, or even a direct DC motor connection won't work, because it will be hard-connected to the motor.

So every transistor has the same L and that L is ""minL"".  minW is the design rule minimum transistor width.  Many transistors are laid out at minW because they are not in a speed critical path and minW gives a very small logic gate that is ""fast enough"".  In those pictures the author is trying to tell you that the inverter (left drawing) has a PMOS whose size is (2*minW/minL) and an NMOS whose size is (1*minW/minL).  The NAND2 drawing (middle) shows that the series transistors {the NMOS devices} are doubled in size compared to an inverter.  If there are ""N"" transistors in series, the width is multiplied by N.  So the two series NMOS devices are (2*minW/minL) instead of (minW/minL).  The NOR2 drawing (right) shows that the series transistors {the PMOS devices} are doubled in size compared to an inverter.  The two series PMOS devices are (4*minW/minL) instead of (2*minW/minL).  Later, grasshopper, you will learn that super duper mega high speed fullrail digital CMOS uses a smallest-W increment which is bigger than the design rule minimum allowed W.  Why?  Because reasons.

ECE,35c2lm,fatangaboo,3,Sat May 9 01:01:16 2015 UTC,"Not in ""fullrail digital CMOS"" as the comment says in its first sentence.  All transistors are minimum L; L does not vary; L is not a design parameter.  Among other reasons, this allows the modeling group to concentrate all their resources (and all of their allocated area on the parameter extraction test chip) to getting excellent fits for a single L.      As alluded to with the ""grasshopper"" remark, W's are often but not quite always treated as a discrete, quantized design parameter.  Generally there's one quantum for the normal layouts and normal standard cells, and another quantum (a multiple of two-legs-with-one-source-drain-contact-between) for nosebleed digital such as the clock tree.  Even in the ""analog IP blocks"" that are often added to fullrail digital CMOS chips, the minimum-L-only restriction is still applied.  I've built PHYs and PLLs and relatively high precision choppered/autozeroed comparators on a digital chip with a foundry process, using minimum L's exclusively.  It's possible.  You can put ten minimum-L transistors in series if you really want to, and if your models are accurate at low VDS, and if your modeling of the body effect is good, simulation matches measurement quite well.  It ain't pretty but it works very nicely."

ECE,35cmmj,alle0441,1 point,Sun May 10 16:44:52 2015 UTC,Depends what the purpose is. Are you filtering to clean up your facility's system? Then you distribute the filters to each drive. Are you doing it to satisfy a utility requirement? Then it usually makes sense to have a large centralized filter at the service point.  Usually what I do is specify the drives to have a 3% line reactor. This drastically reduces the harmonics produced on the distribution system for a fairly low cost. I have also spec'd centralized filters to meet requirements mandated on an existing facility by the utility. So it can go either way.
ECE,35cmmj,tsan600,1 point,Sat May 9 01:27:24 2015 UTC,Yea it's for cleaning the system and protecting equipment. The electric company we consult most of this out to generally suggests to put filters on every motor/vfd so we are trying to figure out how necessary that is because it gets expensive.
ECE,35cmmj,alle0441,1 point,Sat May 9 01:54:08 2015 UTC,Is the equipment requiring protection the VFD? Too high harmonic supply current can cause DC capacitor over heating. Modern VFD  often has a line reactor already in the VFD in order to pass harmonic requirements and there is no need for additional line reactor. Line reactors (in VFD or separate) have a nasty side effect that it reduces DC voltage and therefore maximum motor voltage is reduced. Unfortunately induction motor torque is related to square of voltage. With 3% line reactor motor torque at nominal supply voltage for VFD is reduced to 0.97*0.97 = 0.94 = 94%. This reduction happens at nominal speed of the motor and for example pumps and fans takes max torque/power on high speed. If the supply voltage amplitude happens to be higher than nominal it can compensate for this but on the loaded network this is seldom the case.
ECE,35cmmj,substrate80,1 point,Sat May 9 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"For protecting the equipment, you definitely put a filter at every drive. Have you looked at line reactors? Depending on the size of the drive, it could range from like $50 to $500 per drive. Pretty reasonable if you ask me."
ECE,35cmmj,alle0441,1 point,Sat May 9 02:00:20 2015 UTC,why would you say that?  a line reactor doesn't prevent a drive from frying itself.  Use current limiting / semi-conductor fuses and nix the line reactors.
ECE,35cmmj,substrate80,2,Sat May 9 05:10:53 2015 UTC,I feel like we're being asked different questions. OP asked how to reduce harmonics in his facility. A line reactor attenuates harmonics from propagating from the drive into the system. Of course it won't protect the drive itself. That wasn't the question asked.
ECE,35cmmj,substrate80,-1,Sat May 9 05:16:16 2015 UTC,"As I stated below ... its' more economical to put in an active filter.  Not sure if you downvoted it or not, but someone did."
ECE,35ak8l,thegildedturtle,2,Fri May 8 14:21:01 2015 UTC,a ground/power schematic would be nice. Think about a diff amp or two at the receive end and run your sense signal and a local (clean) ground from the sensor to the diff amp. (Kelvin sensing seems to ring a bell)
ECE,35ak8l,spainguy,1 point,Fri May 8 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem like a bad solution, but I know there has to be another way to do this.  We have older versions of these controllers that work just fine using a single analog signal per value on our telemetry cable.  I don't have the schematic for the newer charge controller telemetry board on hand and I definitely cannot release all of the other schematics for the PCU and sensor decks."
ECE,35ak8l,mantrap2,2,Fri May 8 18:14:56 2015 UTC,This is why using differential signal paths can be useful - common mode drift on grounds is eliminated.  Also look into Kelvin wiring for power applications.
ECE,35ak8l,dreyes,2,Fri May 8 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"You can isolate CC analog ground from PCU ground using some impedance that's much larger than the wire's impedance. Since the wire is a really low impedance, you can basically use any resistor or capacitor. Pick what's cheap.  For example, if you use a 10k resistor between the analog ground input and the primary ground, if the analog ground's wire resistance is 1 ohm, you'll only be getting a 0.01% error between the true analog ground and what appears across the resistor.  That being said, if I understand your system correctly, current is flowing from the PCU to the CC, so the analog ground will probably be at a negative voltage with respect to the PCU's ground. Unless the PCU's telemetry inputs can accept a negative voltage, this won't immediately help you.  If the telemetry inputs cannot take a negative input voltage, you can use a circuit like this ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier_applications#Inverting_amplifier ) with a gain of -1 to convert it to a positive voltage. This would require an op-amp that can have an input voltage below it's ground potential, or a negative supply voltage being fed to the op-amp.   Of course, you could just simplify all of this by doing the analog measurement on the CC board and sending it digitally to the PCU board. Or use to conventional solution to this problem, which is differential signaling."

ECE,357rgk,box_of_resistors,8,Thu May 7 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"Just adding to the voices, the same comments. I'll tell you my story of ""forgot to add decoupling"".  I had an LED dot matrix display that I used for a Snake game. It worked fine when just one LED was blinking... but when I tried to flash all of them, my system kept resetting.  Have you ever been drinking out of a water fountain, when someone flushes a toilet in the nearby bathroom? The water supply dips for a second, because of the sudden inrush of current. The same thing happens to your microcontroller. In my case, the LEDs were the toilet (~100 mA for all the LEDs), and my microcontroller was the water fountain (~5 mA).  Depending on your needs, you'll need to stack capacitance. If you're switching very heavy loads, you might need 47-100 uF to provide ""bulk"" decoupling at the power supply, 1-10 uF per chip, and 100 nF at the power pins. If you're not sure, build in some extra capacitors ""just in case"". Then you can populate them in stages, and find out what works.  I'll add to this... /u/rothw has the right image for proper decoupling. Ideally, you want to minimize the distance of your traces between the cap plus and minus. This becomes especially important in very high speed designs. You'd be surprised what you can get away with though. Your design might resolve your problems as is!  Some miscellaneous thoughts!   Your traces going to the LEDs look really thin! 10 mil was about the limit of what I could comfortably reproduce when making boards by hand. They're also really close together... try giving them some more spacing! Have you tried printing to 1:1 scale, and laying your components out? Just because it looks good in Eagle doesn't mean it'll fit in the real world! Sockets can expand your design, and suddenly nothing fits! Try to keep your top layer routing to left/right, and your bottom layer to up down. That can really make routing signals easier! Oh no! No holes for stand offs, or even rubber feet! :( Have you considered moving LED's 1-4 to the top of your PCB? It would keep you from routing a big ""X"" on the board, and crossing over all your signals! 100 mil pin headers are awesome... but it looks like you don't have them aligned to a 100 mil grid. :( Also, don't forget about other epic connecting parts like screw terminals! Gasp, you have an unrouted pin! 19 on S.R. 1. How are you planning to program your AVR? Is one of your headers UART, and you're using a serial bootloader? If not, you might want to add the ISP header! If you have extra pins, send them out to a header (if possible!) This makes debugging and handling things you forgot much easier!   ALSO! Now that I wrote all this out, it's a requirement you show us your project as it grows! We love project photos! :)"

(Honestly it wont matter for an Atmega but if you want to learn good design practice). Additionally I would pour a copper GND plane on the entire bottom layer. Something i also personal;ly like to do is pour a VCC plane on top, it adds a little bit of extra capacitance, but mainly makes layout cleaner. Be careful with this if you have analog VCC as well."

Also, make it a good habit to not use right angle traces unless there is a via or pad.  Finally, fill unused parts of the planes with as much ground as possible for better EMI resistance... loops = EMI!  Depending on the trace needs, I either go as much GND on the top copper as possible (most traces on bottom so that the GND layer is between the traces and the IC) or I do the top down and left right on top and bottom traces respectively. Try to keep traces under ICs to be on the bottom copper. Normally, you see power filled planes on multi-layered PCBs."

Another use case is to undervolt the LED."

Because the LED is essentially a constant-voltage sink, with a temperature coefficient and drift over time, and this makes it very sensitive to that variation. Let's say you have a 1.5V nominal LED you want to drive at 1A. You figure, ok, I'll just use a 2.0V LED with a 0.5 ohm resistor that dissipates 1/2W. Suppose the LED voltage increases to 1.6V: now you have 0.8A, with 0.32W dissipation in the resistor; if the LED voltage decreases to 1.4V, you have 1.2A, with 0.72W dissipation in the resistor. You can decrease this sensitivity by going to a higher voltage and increasing the power dissipated in the resistor, but then you are less efficient."

All the boards I design does it this way for its pretty blinking lights.  It's less useful in high-powered LEDs due to efficiency loss.  But I will not go as far as saying ""Do NOT use resistors.""  My kitchen was wired 10yrs ago with 1W Luxeon LEDs with inline resistors.  I'm quite aware of the power dissipation loss but am too lazy to re-do the whole thing.  There's a reason CC is better: better control over brightness and eliminates power loss across the resistor.  But CV works too if you know how to size your resistor, and can be more flexible."

There are two things of importance here:  1) assuming the test equipment has static operating characteristics (doesn't degrade with time), how much safety margin do you have? This you could test with a hipot tester or something else to measure the leakage current -- move V- up or down from chassis gnd until you start to measure a leakage current that is unsafe (1uA, 10uA, depending on how dangerous you want to be), see how that voltage compares to the voltage you're using. If you get low leakage current even at 200V and you're using a power supply with V- offset from GND by 40V, that's a good sign. If you get high leakage current at 50V, I wouldn't use it at 40V.  2) how do you know the design has static operating characteristics? Changes in temperature, humidity, aging, etc. can affect the voltage withstanding safety. You can't test this with one power supply, that's what the manufacturer is supposed to be doing. So unfortunately this kind of negates test #1.  That's why I wouldn't order off eBay from China. But I guess my risk tolerance is lower than yours."

But I guess my risk tolerance is lower than yours.   If I just need to build something to use in my home lab to run some lights, I don't see a problem with a buying $20 eBay PSU and testing it.

Looks like it is precise enough to benefit from 16b, though if you're looking for absolute values, it seems that it won't be much more beneficial than 12b (typical accuracy throughout the range is around 0.2C or just a bit better than 12b resolution); if you're looking for change over time, 16b may well be just the ticket. Cool stuff. Nice part."

ECE,3528nx,oddish2211,8,Wed May 6 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"A hardware thread is a stream of instructions executing concurrently on a single pipeline or set of pipelines.  Intel calls this Hyperthreading and basically it's just tagging instructions as being from different instruction streams so that their dependencies and dependents can be tracked independently from one another.  So, to explain this further/more clearly, suppose you have a CPU that does not support hardware threading (or, more appropriately, it only supports a single hardware thread at a time).  It can only support one independent stream of execution at a time so if you have two software threads, let's call them A and B, then you have to run some instructions from A, context switch (take interrupt, dump A's architectural state, flush pipeline, read B's arch state, branch to B's next instruction), run some instructions from B, etc, etc.  If you had a CPU supporting two hardware threads then the single CPU core would appear to the OS as two different CPUs which could then schedule A on core 1.a and schedule B on core 1.b.  The CPU would fetch code for these two threads and these instructions would be somehow tagged as belonging to their respective threads and could enter the same pipeline together.  Just like how out-of-order CPUs take advantage of instruction level parallelism to speed things up hardware threads take advantage of ILP across multiple software threads.  So thread A might be using the adder while thread B is using the load/store unit.  By allowing the two threads to ""live"" ine the CPU at the same time we can make more efficient use of all the different functional units of the CPU.  Now, to answer your question about this instruction.  From what I can tell RDINSTRET is just a monotonic instruction counter that is hardware thread aware.  So if you run RDINSTRET on thread A and thread B you'll get two arbitrary numbers.  But if you run 100,000 instructions on A and then 200,000 instructions on B and then run RDINSTRET again then the result will be 100,000 larger when you run it in thread A and 200,000 larger when you run it in thread B.  However I'm not a RISC V expert so this is just what I'm picking up from your document and what I can find online.  Edit: I played a little fast and loose with ""A"" and ""B"" here.  Early on they mean software threads but when I'm talking about RDINSTRET they mean hardware threads.  If you schedule multiple different software threads on hardware thread ""A"" via context switching then an RDINSTRET on hardware thread ""A"" won't differentiate between the different software threads you ran, just that it shouldn't count whatever instructions were fed to the pipeline from hardware thread ""B"".  Also, from your perspective if you aren't supporting multiple hardware threads in your particular implementation of RISC V this just becomes a simple instruction counter."
ECE,3528nx,SmokeyDBear,2,Wed May 6 15:07:13 2015 UTC,Have you tried to look at the reference implementations?   But what is the hardware thread exactly?    The thread of execution happening on a processor or a logical core. If you're just implementing a single-core processor without any hyper-threading you can ignore this  and just implement a single counter that counts the number of instructions retired and have the instructions read this counter.   what does this counter precisely count?   The number of instructions that have completely finished executing.  Could you tell us a bit more about your project? It would be interesting to hear more about what you're making :)
ECE,3528nx,skyfex,1 point,Wed May 6 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Hey,   When in doubt, you can try and analyze the Rocket processor's code from Berkeley (https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket/blob/master/src/main/scala/csr.scala). In this case, reg_instret is just a counter that increments by 1 if you retire an instruction.   RDINSTRET is very useful if you want to know the performance of your code/processor. You divide the cycle count (rdcycle) from the retired instruction count (rdinstret) and you get the CPI.   If you were implementing a hyperthreaded core (which I'm sure you are not), then you'd have to duplicate the PC counter, the register file, and the control/status register state, including the ""instret"" register."

Computer Engineering:   A good balance between EE and CE; both hardware and software, and you choose how to balance it.   In terms of difficulty, that depends on your aptitude. EE has straight up more math than CE and CS, but CE and CS have more programming. So are you better at programming or better at math?  Obviously it's not an absolute rule - this is just what I have experienced (I'm EE and have friends who are CS and CE)."

I'm just saying the equipment needed to learn CS is readily available, therefore readily used, therefore a lot of people have those skills. The equipment needed to learn EE is more hardware and expensive and less readily available, therefore less used, therefore less people with those skills.  But frankly, I'll stand by my opinion based on what I've seen with friends who went off to industry. A buddy got a CS degree, learned theory, Java, and C#. Got a job doing Ruby on Rails, so he had to spend his nights learning the specific language and tasks. I suppose that's true for all jobs though, I lost my point...  I got an internship doing software work for a medium sized engineering firm, based on the coding I learned in my EE studies.

ECE,34xuva,blaaaaaacksheep,6,Wed May 6 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I experienced the same thing. Then those companies complain that they cant find qualified candidates so bring in more H1Bs or change college curriculum to teach the skills they need.

ECE,34xuva,coldcoldnovemberrain,4,Tue May 5 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"Then those companies complain that they cant find qualified candidates so bring in more H1Bs   Aren't most of the H1Bs that they bring in have been educated in US universities. Unlike software, I think EE talent is mostly sourced within the US.   I think corporations need to subsidize college education for those wanting to pursue engineering, and thus make it attractive for those may not have the means to do so."

ECE,34xuva,sfwwizard,7,Tue May 5 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"The older engineers haven't been in the job market for some time so their information isn't up to date. I'm in a similar position and I was told by a recruiter that indeed many companies don't want to train up engineers. From what I have been experiencing also, companies want you to have professional experience with specialized systems and skills. Using skills from school or from personal hobbies don't ""count"". I get the impression that this is becoming a closed system in terms of the job market. Good luck."
ECE,34xuva,mantrap2,11,Tue May 5 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"The older engineers haven't been in the job market for some time so their information isn't up to date.   Definitely NOT true.   We (I'm 54) have something ""special"":  age discrimination, where if you are grey you can't possible know anything. Trust me, it's as bad as the situation you are living with - the same ""lack of experience"" claim turned on its head.  I still keep a box from my younger days of the 300+ rejection letters I got back then to remind me of how bad it can get.  I ended up working for Intel but getting that job had nothing to do with my blind applications - I got a rejection from Intel HR also 3 weeks after I'd started working there.  It was LOL.  Hobbies can count for the right job.  Also realize that not all companies are identical: some are rigid and bureaucratic while others are progressive and hate BS.  If you only are getting ""hobbies don't count"" companies, you simply are applying to the wrong ones.     IME if they don't count hobbies, they want a working drone, not someone with passion and interest.  Personally I'd never want to work for the former company and only for one that valued the latter.   That's just me but life is too damn short not to enjoy your professional work time.  Of course there is no easy way to tell which is which except by proxies like company age, company employee demographics, etc.    Generally, larger = bureaucratic, inflexible, by-the-policy-only.  Smaller = flatter, flexible, by-what-works.   Sometimes   having an older demographic is bad but sometimes it's good.     If they say ""no hobbies"", it's a sign of their financial health as well.  Namely they operating tight without much margin.  This is where learning how to read financial statements can save you some grief with a marginal company.  The best bet is numbers - you can find people over at /r/engineeringstudents moaning about how they sent out 10 resumes and didn't get a response.  This is sad and funny at the same time.  Don't be that person.  Even better than numbers (which is still a ""lottery"") is to network in meatspace.  This scares a lot of millennials apparently but it's what works.  Personal, look-'em-in-the-eye, ""intimacy"" is worth 10,000 Facebook friends.    You can really sell yourself far better in person than you can ever manage with a dozen ""metadata keywords"".  Any ""marginal qualifications"" can become a rich conversation where the ""truth"" can be triangulated far better.  It boggles my mind that anyone thinks that online/paper only applications would be good idea.  If you aren't going to trade shows, conferences, etc. you should start. Even if you can't afford the ""conference papers"", attend the commercial exhibits.  You'll rub shoulders with other engineers in a particular specialty and with companies that sell into that speciality.  It's a ""target rich environment"" for networking.  Be that guy!  Finding the right job IS partly luck.  But it's definitely not passive."
ECE,34xuva,LaughLax,4,Tue May 5 15:15:17 2015 UTC,300+ rejection letters? It boggles my mind that that many companies actually responded to you at all! Seems to me like not many companies I've come across have that courtesy.

This is just the way they (we) write the job postings, to try to match someone who can hit the ground running. In my company the resumes read like this but we always expect some time to come up the learning curve, and someone who can learn quickly but not a perfect match of skill sets, is usually better than someone who has all the skills but is a poor learner.  Network, network, network. Talk to people in different industries, find something you're interested in, with a good company.  If you like working with customers, consider working as a Field Applications Engineer (FAE) -- they are supposed to have a wide range of skillsets.

ECE,34xuva,blaaaaaacksheep,2,Tue May 5 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"Ask Microchip FAEs about their experience. I think you'll find it is totally different than what you've described. Yes, our FAEs and FSEs are salaried (no commissions), and yes, they each have a territory and visit customers, but it's not living in a hotel. I worked out of the Massachusetts office for a few months while coordinating my move out to AZ, and the guys there usually worked maybe 1/3 of the time from the office, 1/3 of the time from their home workshop, and 1/3 of the time visiting customers. (1-2 days in each category, varies w/ what's going on) The New England area is pretty small geographically, so I guess traveling is more extensive if you are in a sparser tech area (e.g. USA Midwest/South/Rocky Mountains, or other areas of the world), but it's not an endless cycle of traveling in hotels, and somehow I doubt their work weeks are any longer than 50 hours at the absolute highest."

Try to get your resume out there as much as possible.  The hiring manager might even suggest an entry level position you'd be better suited for.  Keep applying, and make sure you are tuning your resume and cover letter for every position for which you applying.  Including key words from the job description at the very top of your resume goes a long way towards getting noticed. For example, if they are looking for a Linux proficient Perl developer OPEN with that information. It should be the first thing the HR person reads, because that's really all they care about."

About a month after that incident I guess he just decided to stick it to the man and started to teach us Python again.

He presented almost every single lesson in pseudo-code, followed by ""here is how I would do it in C"", followed by ""you're free to do your programming assignments in whatever language you choose"".  Like I said, probably the best teacher I ever had.  I really hated JCL, and submitting our jobs to the AMDAHL plug core for the OS/370 at A&M.  Around finals, you would have to come back the next day to look at your program output.  This is why I liked C.  I could run it on my TRS-80 Model 4 and get results in a few seconds.

Once you've finished your Java basics and know what a class, method, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. are, go onto any C++ tutorial website and you'll pick it up quickly.  It isn't just a change in syntax unfortunately, there are some fundamental differences (having to explicitly pass by reference vs. by value, heap vs. stack, etc.) but those are easy concepts to tack onto your understanding if your fundamentals are sound."

You'll be learning concepts (flow control, data structures, etc.) about programming that will translate to any language. Plus there is a lot of crossover between Java and ""higher"" level C variants. The fun part of programming is when you realize you can learn the basics of any language relatively quickly. If you wish you learned something besides Java then Google ""learn x the hard way"" and you'll find great tutorials. Highly recommend learning a different language in your free time while taking the Java class because it will give you a different perspective and keep you from forming any bad habits."
ECE,34vtjs,Jmerzian,3,Wed May 6 05:42:17 2015 UTC,"Go with C++, if you want the benefits of java its an easy switch to C#, if you need even more control over low level functions you can switch to C.

And odds are you'll need to learn more along the way during your entire career.  I'm an analog circuit guy and I've learned and had to use probably 25-30 programming languages and can program well in 5-10 of them.  After the first few, any new language becomes a lot easier.  The most recent: System Verilog and PLC.  This is why I find these questions both amusing and silly.  It's really the wrong question.   I'll bet money most CompE students will have to use both at some point fairly soon in their work careers so it doesn't really matter.   Pick one now.  Learn both eventually."

ECE,34vtjs,Muirbequ,2,Tue May 5 04:45:55 2015 UTC,"While more recent languages will probably be around for the long term for some applications, plain old C (not C++) will certainly be around longer.  C has the low level, hardware access that many programs need.  Operating systems, embedded systems, etc.  I've written many C/assembly systems that couldn't possibly be done in python or ruby.  C/assembly will almost certainly never go away."
ECE,34vtjs,_NW_,2,Tue May 5 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Well assembly can't go away unless you get rid of the idea of traditional software.   I do agree that knowing low level constructs is good to know. But it's way easier to write bad C code (and especially assembly) than it is to write bad Java code. From a pedagogical point of view, learning how to do things in a restricted environment will prevent relying on constructs like goto statements which are known to create spaghetti code if misused."

I started my first two years as a BME, i was lucky to have great circuits teacher who got me into EE, turns out we have a joint program bioelectronics emphasis. where i get a EE degree with a BME minor. It helped me become more marketable as a job seeker with only a bachelors. What type of medical field do you want to go into? cellular engineering, physiological systems, or more medical and diagnostic devices. If you are feeling medical/diagnostic devices, i would lean more towards the EE CE fields, it you like lab work, cell culturing and the phisiogical aspects in the medical field then bme is a choice.  My sisters boyfriend, went to grad school for BME then switched to CE i am not sure what he wants though.  For sure try to look for a school which offers both so you can take a class which is in either discipline. Its what you want. there are plenty of jobs in each. IMHO i think CE or EE with some course work in BME can make you more marketable and have a sort of  fallback plan.

ECE,34urtg,BoratRemix,16,Mon May 4 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand the different roles out in the real world.  When I graduated, I was exactly like you.  I knew I liked the classes with FPGAs and working with mentor graphics + VHDL.     Broadly, this is how it works:     Designer: They design hardware in VHDL or verilog (mostly verilog).  That's basically it.  In big chip companies (Intel, nVidia, AMD, etc.) you work with architects to design individual blocks like pipeline stages, memory controllers, and other chunks of a design.  In a smaller core company or a mixed signal design group, you'll either design the whole thing yourself or work with other designers to each tackle chunks of the design.  Once you've written the code for your block, you hand if off to the verification team. Verification: These guys make sure the designers didn't make any mistakes.  They take the code from them and create testbenches either in systemverilog, verilog ams, or some other language like C.  They generate stimulus and checkers to make sure the design works.  They run simulations, collect code coverage, and verify the design works. Validation: These are the guys that typically get their hands dirty the most.  Often they work with the designers to prototype the design on FPGAs.  They're down in the lab often checking signals on oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.  Their main focus is on guaranteeing the design works when it comes back from the fab.  When the chip is released, they'll get the first chips back and check to make sure that everything actually worked.  It is one thing to work in presilicon verification environment but it has to work in the real world and that's what these guys are checking. Test guys will design the test equipment needed to make sure that the chip is tested thoroughly at manufacturing.  Every single die needs to be tested to make sure it falls within normal process corners.  Outliers are either thrown out or bined and sold as a lower functionality chip.  These guys design the testing processing and the testing equipment to use during manufacturing.  They also work with designers to guarantee there is the correct DFT (design for test) access so that they can conclusively prove that chips work quickly and easily.  Test time equate to money so these guys will do optimizations to shave milliseconds off the test time. Backend engineers: This is pretty vague because everyone does this differently.  Basically these are the guys that take the HDL code from the designers and synthesis it to gates then run it through place and route.  They frequently work with scripting and backend tools from cadence or whoever to add power rings, generate timing files to annotate netlists with for verification purposes, and create the final schematic to be physically created.  In mixed signal teams there are also layout guys who do something similar but they manually place blocks around on a chip to optimize for size and power.    These are just things I wish I had better understood when I was graduating.  Everyone in school wants to do design.  Unfortunately the majority of people wanting to do digital design when they graduate end up doing verification.  Design work is much rarer than verification, especially at big chip companies.  Most of the time, designers have a Masters.  Having said that, you can still do design with just a B.S. but it is harder to find.  Verification has a negative connotation just because of what you may have done in school.  It is much more interesting than just making sure your code works.  Don't write it off.    Of the companies I'd look at, I can tell you where I applied back when I was looking for a job.  Intel, nVidia, AMD, Microsoft (hardware division, xbox, kinect, etc), Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Northrop Grumamn, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Tesla, ARM, Broadcom, Maxim, Analog Devices, Micron, Samsung, Motorola, Apple, and many others.

In the right hand side of the page, you may find some suggestions for the companies that may be in similar field.  2) google 'top companies in xyzField'  3)search by job titles. Again, likedIn smartly suggests SOME jobs that may be a little difficult to find using job search engines. LinkedIn suggests those openings from the title you have on linkedIn. So for e.g. i had new graduate in my title, so it would suggest me new grad jobs that weren't really shown by indeed, monster, workopolis. I mean those jobs would be shown on indeed, but would be buried a lot deeper. Best thing about using linkedIn is that it wouldn't just show an ugly chunk of text rendered automatically, but it would show you the company logo as well which i find much more useful.  Even though what i m about to say is not really relevant to your post, but I can bet it will save you from A LOT of trouble. Best way to make your application stand out is to directly contact to the company recruiter. I wrote this a while ago, hope it helps.  How to find a recruiters email id:  1) go to LinkedIn and search for the company  2)use the advanced tab in the results and narrow down your search by using keywords like HR, talent, human, resources, recruiter, office manager (they are responsible for hiring in smaller companies).   3) if you are still getting lots of people, then narrow down even more based on the location of the job. So if the job is in Calgary, try searching for people on Calgary area.   4) now you have some people who you want to get in touch with. Select a person.   5)LinkedIn being the scum they are, will replace the last name with their initial. There's a work around. It should be on Google, if not Lemme know.   6) once you have the first and last name of the person, then you go to google and search for @companyname.ca or @companyname.com   7)Google search will probably give you some results of some other people in the same company.   8)that name will give you a pattern of the type of email that company uses. For example it could be john.doe@work.com or it could be doej@work.com. And so on.

ECE,34utnt,thebucketmouse,3,Mon May 4 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"There might be an option of pulsing some higher frequency signal over the DC lines to allow signalling to an active device.  This is the general principle of how power-line networking stuff works - you can even get home use adapters that add networking over your AC wiring (though there can be problematic aspects).  So you need some kind of RF or at least past audio range generator and then a detector on each device, and it probably needs to decode some kind of addressing in the data stream to figure out if commands are meant for it.  Depending how you do it, there may be some termination concerns to keep the signal from bouncing through the line too long, but making the signalling slow enough might also work.  The whole scheme becomes much simpler if you allow adding one additional wire to carry the signal, but I can understand the reasoning for not wanting to do this."

Perhaps he has an idea in mind that's different from what you are thinking of. Clarify this before presenting a solution that's akward and complicated.  you could do it by transmitting a signal down the dc wires, but that involves an entire digital system, and, networking, and transceivers, and this leaves you with something that is considerably more expensive and prone to failure then it needs to be. The relay wires are fail safe, if the wires come loose or get cut, the relays loose their power, and the entire system shuts down.  Also why do the panels have to disconnect in sequence, especially if they are wired in series? It's certainly doable, but at the expense of additional complexity."

ECE,34utnt,bradn,2,Mon May 4 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"So, I pretty much understand what you're trying to do, but what's the reasoning for it?  Is there a more specific explanation than ""safety reasons""?  Like, is it to shut down panel linkage for maintenance purposes, where otherwise there could be unsafe voltages?"
ECE,34utnt,bradn,1 point,Mon May 4 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"So currently code dictates that there needs to be a DC disconnect for the entire array, which disconnects it from the grid. That said, if the sun is shining, even if disonnected, the system on the roof is still hot, often running at around  500 volts DC. The concern is mostly voiced by the NFPA, or the fire fighters, who in the case of a fire, would need to navigate a roof in order to cut a whole through the roof to relieve pressure. (this is why by code there needs to be a 3 foot buffer space between the roof edge and the solar pv array)"
ECE,34utnt,bradn,2,Mon May 4 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, there are some weird little challenges involved here.  For instance, if the panels are to operate without grid connected, then there would probably need to be power to the inverter side of the panels to operate the disconnect.  But it's kinda a catch 22 because by definition when the panels are disconnected, there is no power available at the output, unless you leave one panel always connected (as in your diagram).  For this reason, I think powering the transmitter would probably fall into one of a few schemes:   Rely on grid power or local backup power to activate the panels Always operate the transmitter from panel voltage (this means you need a power supply that can handle one panel voltage, and all panel voltage) Operate the transmitter from panel voltage when only one panel is on, but relay disconnect power feed before turning on the panels, and then operate from inverter output after the panels are on (use capacitors for power during the switch) - but this could be a problem if the inverter takes a long time to power up. Have a small panel dedicated to powering the transmitter (with all the installation and maintenance headaches that go with that).   But assuming that's okay, I would probably engineer it such that the disconnect devices are powered by the local panel voltage which should always be available as long as the panel can produce power and output isn't shorted.  After that, the disconnects should default to disconnected state, and only ""hook in"" when a signal is present coming from the inverter direction.  I would recommend using some kind of digital signalling that can't somehow be confused with noise on the wires (rather than just a plain constant carrier signal), so that accidental connect chances are minimized.  Turning off the signal would cause each disconnect to open, and applying the signal would first switch the closest panel, then the next panel, then the next panel, until they're all turned on.  I don't think you really need individual panel addressing for just a bulk on/off type switching."
ECE,34utnt,bradn,1 point,Mon May 4 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"thanks for the response. what device do you think could be used as the disconnect? assuming no other wires can be added to the system. can you give an example of the ""digital signalling"" you allude to? would a digital signal require some form of decoding at each device module connection?"
ECE,34utnt,bradn,2,Mon May 4 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there's a pre-made device (others might have more ideas) but if I were to design one:  Low current power supply rated for panel voltage (could be resistor and zener diode type if really low current operation can be achieved).  Microcontroller that can operate from low current to decode signalling, and whatever receive front-end would be necessary to detect signal presence  Logic level N-MOSFET that can be used to disconnect the negative side of that panel via microcontroller control.  Also possible is relay operation but this will require more power and maybe a different style of power supply.  Putting a capacitor across the link that the mosfet disconnects will allow high frequency signals to propagate through but block DC voltage.  The final negative wire could be ""disconnected"" to the high frequency with an inductor, to cause it to be a stable ground reference (you may have to wire this to each of the modules, but it could be capacitor isolated for safety reasons).  But, I think in absolute terms, introducing this ground wire is potentially exposing the user to a higher voltage difference that they might be able to touch.  For instance, even with the system energized, you would still need to touch both a high voltage and low voltage part of the circuit to get zapped (assuming it isn't grounded to something on the roof).  Well, introducing that ground wire now means there is something in touching distance that can complete the circuit (which maybe isn't an issue when the system is turned off, but when it's left on, it might increase danger in absolute terms).  I'm not sure what kind of issues happen with the signal propagation in a series style arrangement - normally those kind of things are done with parallel wiring like a normal household AC wiring, maybe the extra ground wire isn't needed, I don't know."

ECE,34obwi,idiotsecant,3,Sun May 3 17:34:46 2015 UTC,Best way to learn is to write a program for PID speed control for a motor. PID is the most used algorithm in industry and utilizing Matlab or some equivalent program you can design controls in a continuous form (Laplace transforms are easier to understand than Z transforms) and convert your continuous equation to discrete based on the sample rate.

ECE,34obwi,new_ion,1 point,Tue May 5 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"If you don't know control theory, just think of something that interests you that you can use computers to ""control"".    E.g., while I was taking a control theory class, we were supposed to do projects (mostly theoretical -- i.e., just do the math for it), but I wanted to actually try to build mine.  My idea was to make an automatic guitar tuner (I know they already exist).  I took the tuning gear off of an old bass, put it on a two by four, gutted out a space for a single coil pick-up and then strung one string.  I found a small stepper motor and made a gear network to mesh with the tuning knob.    When I ""excited"" the string (i.e., plucked it), the pick-up would output a small analog signal of the sound wave.  This was my input into a microcontroller (after a little amp circuit).  I wrote some logic in the uC (I'll go into that in a minute), and then my output was to control a driver circuit that spun the motor one way or the other, tuning the note sharp and flat until it matched the note that I programmed the uC to tune it to.    The math or ""algorithm"" in the code was the most fun and difficult part of the project.  I determined the average change in frequency that one step of the stepper motor would produce (this is not linear, as, the lower/high the frequency, the less/more a single step would increase/decrease the frequency of the guitar note).  So this is when my pseudo-control theory came into play.  I would pluck the string, the micro would see how far off the frequency of the note was to what i programmed, the i'd just do X steps of the motor.  After it was done, i'd check the note again, turn some more, etc.  Once I was in +/- X hz from the note, i just stopped.    It was really fun.  My teacher was really impressed, and despite not really using anything from his class (I didn't do any real control theory -- e.g., PID), he gave me a 4.0 anyway.  I was technically ""controlling"" something, but just not in an optimized way that control theory is supposed to show.  Also, I think, since mine was mostly digital and the class was on analog, I couldn't really apply it anyway.    Anyway, hope this helps with coming up with an idea.  Just think of something you like and think of some way you can automate it or have some fun with it."

ECE,34mv6x,Intuiton,12,Sat May 2 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"When you get good enough (practice, practice), you can ""write the circuit equations from sight"" which includes automatically writing the Laplace element equation term.  Basically in the time it takes to trace out a loop, you've written each of the simultaneous equations.  There are also certain simplifications that arise.  E.g. in BJTs, the base-emitter voltage drop is ""0.7V"" by default so you just write that on visual inspection.   Similarly, if you know you are hooked into a high-impedance load or similar, you can ignore loading effects and that simplifies the equations.  And there are ""design patterns"" to circuits.   I've written the input impedance of a CE amplifier circuit so many times, I know it by heart:   Zin = Rb + (Hfe+1)(Rpi + Re)  Generally you don't get to this level until/unless you reach senior year with analog circuit electives under your belt and lots of circuit analysis drills (just like when you learned multiplication tables).  Why is there no automatic tool?   Well, you can't really ""know"" analog circuit design without having the depth and experience to actually do this kind of circuit analysis by inspection.  Most design involves exactly ""seeing"" the equation and working out what happens.  Just get the answer returned to you does NOT give you the intuitions to really do analog circuit design.  Working the equations over and over again does.  Another issue: SPICE lies.  SPICE is the go-to analyzer application for numeric results but because it uses Newton-Raphson numerical integration/differentiation, it is mathematically chaotic AND prone to locking in on wrong answers.  So you still need to know what the circuit ""is supposed to do"" by manual techniques to actually trust what SPICE is telling you.  SPICE lies to you often enough you should NEVER take what it says as the truth.    E.g. if I'm doing something with transistors, I go an inspect the voltage biases on EVERY transistor and make sure it's biased the way I'd expect based on how it's used in the circuit.  A very common problem when SPICE is flailing is one or more transistors are biased incorrectly.  This leads to what the problem is - often an incorrect component value, a topological error or some other mistake in the design.  There was a post here a while back where someone was asking about ""more computing power"" for a SPICE simulation.  The circuit being simulated for simple enough that this could not really have been necessary.  The issue was almost certainly SPICE ""lying"" by non convergence which often results in simple circuits iterating and sucking down CPU like crazy.  Often the cause is a single component being wrong or a physical non-reality in the circuit (e.g. KVL being violated in a loop as a result of component values combined with floating point truncation).  Symbolic analysis is certainly possible but it's tricky as a generic thing.  There are pathological conditions that can fool such algorithms.  Many of these are related to what confounds SPICE.  But if it just poops out the answer, how do you know it's right?  If it is right, what assumptions were made.  It sounds like a ""simple algebra"" problem but especially with transistors and such, you actually are talking about small signal vs. large signal, and the large signal equations often can not be reduced algebraically.   Again, SPICE's answer: linearize numerically and solve the matrix math numerically.  My advice: do as many drills on TF analyses until you can do thing without much thought or effort or time."

I've ""bet the chip on SPICE"" myself, more than once, and won every bet, every time.  But those projects were carried out by senior design engineers who knew how to diagnose that CAD tools (not just SPICE) were producing Garbage-Out.  These designers had enough experience to know how to find the Garbage-In that was the root cause, and fix it.

ECE,34mv6x,electronicsauce,1 point,Mon May 4 00:39:19 2015 UTC,"Cool, I've seen simple bandpass circuits, just none with a complete RLC terminated by RLC in parallel.  But I guess you would use these if you wanted a fourth order pole and second order zero bandpass.  I've just plotted the response with my tool, pretty interesting.  Well, thanks for my learning tip of the day."
ECE,34mv6x,KD2BMH,2,Mon May 4 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"There are tricks to simplify matters depending on the circuit topology. For two port cascaded networks, like RF transmission lines, you can use ABCD parameters or S parameters to get the transfer function. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-port_network  There are tricks for higher port networks too, but you need to tailor to the topology.  I have used SymPy with python to convert the transfer function from the s-domain symbolically. I'm an Open Source guy though, and a for pay tool like MATLAB is a good choice if you're a student or have $$$."
ECE,34mv6x,DerpyDan,2,Sat May 2 17:17:36 2015 UTC,Is there a good sympy resource for EE related functionality?   I'm a 2nd year EE and already know python and see SymPy referenced often enough that learning it specifically for EE applications seems like a great idea.
ECE,34mv6x,KD2BMH,1 point,Sat May 2 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"Not really per say.  If you look to Python as a EE tool, you can't hurt to start with numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.  I use them extensively in my personal project.  Check out the HDL repo for how I combine this with MyHDL to do FPGA/DSP development https://github.com/testaco/whitebox/tree/master/hdl"

ECE,34mv6x,fatangaboo,1 point,Sat May 2 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"a for pay tool like MATLAB is a good choice if you're a student or have $$$   I've been thinking of GNU-Octave as a substitute for MATLAB ; what I've read suggests it has the same functionality and can run ""most"" MATLAB scripts unmodified.  Do you have encouraging words about that?"
ECE,34mv6x,soniclettuce,1 point,Sat May 2 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"I think octave's gui is still in beta. If yo're fine writing scripts in a separate editor and using octave from the command line, it'll probably cover a decent amount of matlab.   I ended up just using matlab at school because I needed all the simulink plugins, and octave doesn't have any of that."
ECE,34mv6x,KD2BMH,1 point,Sat May 2 21:17:00 2015 UTC,I know many folks who use Octave as a substitute for MATLAB.  Hack away!
ECE,34mv6x,YoshiWithTheHair,1 point,Sun May 3 05:31:25 2015 UTC,You can do state space equations and then from there since you have it in that nice form you can really quickly put it in transfer function form.
ECE,34mv6x,who_dat_who_der,0,Sat May 2 17:25:50 2015 UTC,But how many people actually remember:  C * ( s * I - A )^-1 * B + D
ECE,34mv6x,incontrol,1 point,Sat May 2 20:23:48 2015 UTC,Depending on the complexity of the ciruit you could consider using bond graphs as an intermediate between the diagram of the circuit and the expression of its dynamics.  See for example: http://www.usafa.edu/df/dfem/research_info/dynamics/bgdesign.pdf  and the lecture notes at http://www.me.utexas.edu/~bryant/courses/me344/  and http://www.20sim.com/
