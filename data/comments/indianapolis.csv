If you want much cheaper, you will have to move even further from Indy. Cloverdale is a small town 40 mins from Indy, with hotels in the sub $70 range.

Currently working in craft beer and let me tell you, there is a lot to choose from on both ends.   Breakfast/Brunch:  Cafe Patachou is good and they have multiple locations, but if you want arguably the best breakfast food you have ever tasted, you need to go to  Milktooth. Award winning chef, unique and exciting dishes, amazing coffee. The. Shit.   Also, there are a couple cool Donut Shops that are new and cool. Rocket 88 and General American Doughnut. Trust me. I know.   Here are some of my other faves: Siam Square: Excellent Thai Food. Reasonably Priced.  Bru Burger: Awesome Burgers and Beer. Will be busy. Is always busy.   MacNiven's: One of the better beer lists in the city and Scottish American Comfort food. Scotch eggs are great. The MacHatten is a gem.   Bluebeard: A little spendy, but if you are a foodie, you should try and stop by. Menu changed daily, great cocktails. never had anything here that wasn't top shelf.   La Parada: Maybe the best mexican in the city. It's in the hood, but don't let that stop you.   If you really want an adventure, head on over to the west side and hit up. Szechwan Garden for dim sum or Saigon for Pho. They both have huge menu's and are super authentic and delicious.   Beer/Bars: I love The Sinking Ship. If beards/tattoos/metal scare you, then don't go. They have and awesome beer list and the are an ""unofficial"" Blackhawks bar.   The Brass Ring in Fountain square is also a cool spot as is Thunderbird and Revolucion.   Here are my favorite Breweries in no particular order. Daredevil Sun King: Tasting room downtown: No Food Bier Brewery Black Acre: Central State Brewing Taxman.  On a side note, what are the details of your show? How would one get tickets to said show?"

Food-wise, there's a few options that I can list off the top of my head that I believe aren't chains and found only in Indianapolis/Central Indiana:  For breakfast that strikes a decent balance between pretentiousness and actually tasting good, check out Cafe Patachou. There's one about two blocks from the Convention Center but will probably be packed. They also did a spinoff artisnal pizzeria called Napolese. They have one pizza that tastes like a farmer's market if that's what you're into. They also somehow have an Express location in the Indy Airport so take that however you like. There are probably a bunch of spinoffs on the North side of town as well, but I've never been to them.  Breweries, there's a ton and I don't know nor care to list them all. Sun King is solid but they sponsor everything including GenCon so you don't actually have to go to their brewery to get a hold of their beer. Tow Yard Brewing Company is a bit smaller. Their beer is interesting and they also have solid dry rub wings. Like actual wings, not the tiny little ones you get in bulk at the grocery store.  While I'm on the subject of wings, there's a small second story bar in the City Market building called Tomlinson Tap Room. They have the best beer can dry rub wings I've ever had. To be fair, I was drunk and I'm not that worldly when it comes to dry rub wings. Still though, I recommend. Also the first floor of that place has crepes, Philly cheese steaks, ""gelato"", sandwiches, and who knows what else packed into this little indoor market-esque place. I recommend if you're around during their hours. Last year Shut Up and Sit Down threw a party up there and everyone got incredibly drunk.  If you like coffee and/or frozen yogurt, there's a place called Pearings about a block from the mall. It's a decent frozen yogurt place (I honestly don't know how you could fuck that up) and I hear from my coffee-drinking friends that they have great coffee.  There's also St. Elmo's Steakhouse but good fucking luck getting a reservation during GenCon at this point. Just watch the Park's and Recreation episode where they go eat there if that's what gets you off. There's also Harry and Izzy's Steakhouse which I guess is a spinoff but I don't really know because I'm not that invested in finding out for sure.  Burger-wise there's Bru Burger but I've never not had to wait an hour to get a table so I don't even want to imagine what it's like during GenCon. Alternatively, there's Punch Burger which I guess is the In 'n Out to Bru Burger's Five Guys in terms of burger joint philosophy, except Punch Burger goes for the locally-sourced beef (from a guy named Dave, according to their website) so I guess the comparison breaks down there."

indianapolis,3dxi82,Besca,9,Mon Jul 20 10:16:53 2015 UTC,I'm happy to see the officials at Crown Hill were willing to work with the cycling community and provide a clear set of rules to allow bicycles in the park.  It's a much better result than what the IMA pulled.
indianapolis,3dxi82,stmbtrev,7,Mon Jul 20 14:35:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Cyclists are happy with the rules, IMA Crown Hill is happy with the rules, guests and pedestrians are happy with the rules. Couldn't have asked for a better outcome."
indianapolis,3dxi82,photo1kjb,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:31 2015 UTC,IMA is happy with the rules   Did you mean Crown Hill?  I think the only people happy about the IMA policy are the board and executives of the IMA.
indianapolis,3dxi82,stmbtrev,3,Mon Jul 20 15:19:47 2015 UTC,Good catch. Monday morning coffee has worn off.
indianapolis,3dxi82,photo1kjb,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm pleased they didn't completely ban cycling there, but for me, bombing that hill was half the reason to ride in the cemetery. Don't count me among the cyclists that are happy about this outcome."
indianapolis,3dxi82,RhythmPanther,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"As fun as bombing that hill is, I really just like cruising around on decent pavement with little to no traffic."
indianapolis,3dxi82,stmbtrev,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:16 2015 UTC,bomb is apparently your favorite word?
indianapolis,3dxi82,iateataco,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the climb more than the descent, which was uncomfortable at times with weather/cars/people etc around. Climbing the north face is still allowable at least."

indianapolis,3dz83v,frequencity,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:06 2015 UTC,I've seen them at Yats before. I also saw them at Goose the Market recently.
indianapolis,3dz83v,willow1031,2,Mon Jul 20 21:49:15 2015 UTC,I've seen them at a walgreens before by the counter.
indianapolis,3dz83v,Bobbyboyle1234,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"I've tried the ones at Yats, and while they're not bad, they're not the soft caramel-y goodness that I look for in a praline, nor do I feel they are comparable to Lammes, which are my favorite. Besides, at Yats they're $3 a pop and you can get a 24-pack of Lammes on amazon for $35 with prime."
indianapolis,3dz83v,caboosevamoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Are Texas pralines different from New Orleans pralines? The ones I've had aren't typically chewy, they more melt in your mouth. Wiki describes them as having ""a creamy consistency, similar to fudge"" which is how I'd describe them too. I don't know that I've had ones that are like chewy or caramel-y."
indianapolis,3dz83v,caboosevamoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...maybe? I've never had New Orleans pralines, but Texas ones are about as soft to bite into as fudge, and by caramel-y I mean they can be stretched a bit and don't break apart when you bite into them."

indianapolis,3dz0eb,Thpike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"It has been a year since I last did this but if everything is the same...  The cutout along Washington in front of the Simon Building is one of those ""20 minute loading zone"" parking areas from 8am-6pm or something like that.  Which means it is fair game (and free) outside those hours.  I would ride my motorcycle and park it on the far west edge of that zone where the curb starts to curve back to the street...so even if that zone is full of cars there is typically room for a bike or two there.  Then a 2 block walk to the center field gate."

indianapolis,3dr7vu,XmasCarroll,3,Sat Jul 18 18:19:20 2015 UTC,Was it by a courier or did amazon deliver it themselves?   I go to college in indy and I don't think amazon will have an easy time being allowed to deliver packages to us unless it's through a registered courier.
indianapolis,3dr7vu,Flippidy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:35 2015 UTC,what did you order?

His partying lifestyle and numerous mentions of telephone area codes are not something I want my child exposed to. I've worked with our homeowners association to make sure no Pitbull is allowed in our community.

indianapolis,3donho,ostsjoe,5,Sat Jul 18 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"A suggestion - make sure to go to all the local shelters & humane societies (ACC, Indy Humane, Hamilton Humane, etc.) and look for your dogs in person - do NOT rely on them to tell you if your dog is there. Physically go into the shelters and ask to check. And come back to check regularly as you never know when they'll be picked up. Too many people just assume the shelter staff are going to keep their eyes open or check for you but they're often overwhelmed by the sheer volume and your description may not match what they think the dogs appear to look like. You need to go there and do it yourself.   Just my $0.02 from dealing with this in the past..."
indianapolis,3donho,ejly,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"The chips will help, as shelters should be checking on entry, but yeah people do make mistakes especially when overwhelmed."
