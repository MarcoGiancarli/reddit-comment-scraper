For the lower end robots, the biggest differences from the higher end robots to justify the lower price are the lack of catch net/ball recycle and oscillation to vary ball placement.

One thing to point out though, is that loops and chops have very different requirements. Looping rubbers are good at increasing spin and generally have high throw, while chopping rubbers are good for reversing spin and getting the ball back onto the table (generally have lower throw and are more powerful IIRC). I'd suggest something like Hurricane 3 on the forehand for looping (when you're ready to change rubbers), and....maybe you could chop on your instinct with appropriate rubber if you want to experiment there, I don't think anybody chops with a composite blade really."

tabletennis,3ctaum,jjharryk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:05 2015 UTC,Do a lot of drills with a practice partner. This helps me a lot and decreases recovery time.  A very famous and useful one is:   Your Partner does a basic topspin serve to your backhand. You do BH topspin to his backhand. He blocks to the middle of the table. You do FH topspin to his backhand. He blocks to your BH corner. You do BH topspin again He blocks to the wide FH You do FH topspin to his BH He blocks to the BH Go back to 2.   Focus on trying to do lots of repetitions with a clean technique rather than trying to blast every ball. Loop every ball with topspin but with control and placement. You shouldn't be hitting the ball.
tabletennis,3ctaum,anchorschmidt8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"pretty much like this, right?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymf9tiPGEwY  I probably can do it in practice session, but often in match play, my mind often goes blank and just want to hit the ball... Probably constant practice (to build muscle memory) is the answer but idk, maybe im just frustrated right now.. thanks"
tabletennis,3ctaum,anchorschmidt8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this takes time, don't worry about it.   Another thing that you can do is play with slightly weaker players and just concentrate on your technique during match play. You will be able to control the point and focus on setting up your forehand topspin. This will be a good opportunity for you to test your technique in a situation where there is no set pattern for the rally.  Don't worry about winning or losing. That is what practice matches are for. In order for you to try different things so that you can do better in the matches that really matter."

tabletennis,3coy6u,Zergom,3,Thu Jul 9 16:34:55 2015 UTC,I personally like going for a more expensive blade and cheaper rubbers  since I have a tendency to buy new random rubbers if they feel any good at all when trying out a clubmate's blade.

tabletennis,3coy6u,LhetGou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"Hurricane 3 Neo is like $18, which would give you a very high-level forehand rubber while barely scratching the budget.

tabletennis,3ckb0d,-hower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the new poly ball has really messed with my game as well. I switched from H3 to Haifu Whale 2 on my forehand, and my loop is a bit more drive oriented.  I think the proper ""poly ball tuned"" rubbers aren't really out yet. I've just switched to slightly faster equipment. I don't think the equipment scene has changed too much because of the poly ball yet.  Welcome back!"
tabletennis,3ckb0d,FTFYWithATypo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Haifu Whale 2   can u review the difference between h3 and that? Im currently using h3 (and I like it) but willing to try something new :D  Found this online:  Compared to H3 Provincial 40 deg, the Haifu Whale II 38 Degree untuned version is faster, has almost the same hardness but different feel. Haify is tacky like the H3, the top sheet is similar to 729 rahter than DHS. I found H3 Provincial is easier to loop under spin ball than Whale II. Serving with H3 Provincial is easier to do underspin serve rather than Whale II. The ball seems can't penetrate into the sponge deeper while using Whale II, with H3 it's easier to penetrate, this is due to the bouncier/springier sponge of Whale II."
tabletennis,3ckb0d,Hamasaki_Fanz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:10:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like that review is pretty accurate. However, tuned Haifu is a completely different monster in my opinion.  One of the interesting things about Haifu is that it is pretty low throw. (lower than Skyline or H3) However, the tuning makes it pretty fast. This behavior, in my opinion, is the biggest adjustment people have to understand. As the ball tends to fly out if the ball isn't properly spun.  Aside from being faster, one thing I really like about Haifu is that the bite on the ball is better with thin contact when compared to H3. And if you can't feel out the ball, just spinning the crap out of it will get it on the table.  I've found that people either love it or hate it. It's quite polarizing."

tabletennis,3ckb0d,FTFYWithATypo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"It actually works quite well with really exaggerated, lazy strokes. Punching is likely to send the ball off the table, but huge swingy medium-speed strokes just gain speed out of nowhere."

If you don't hit there's a large risk the ball goes out and your opponent scores a point, or it doesn't hit edge and you end up with a weak service and a rally in your opponents favor. I'd also consider going for edgeballs intentionally to be really bad manners."

tabletennis,3c03g9,unknown2374,2,Fri Jul 3 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"If it's your FIRST non-cheap blade, try a 5 ply wood like Butterfly Primorac or Stiga Clipper. This goes doubly since you said your playstyle is more control/chop based rather than attacking. Carbon blades are pretty much entirely for attacking, as the whole point of carbon plies is to add stiffness to the blade without adding too much weight.  An all-wood blade will give you much better feeling for the ball, and much better control on your blocks and chops.  Please note that I'm saying this as a person who started playing with a Timo Boll ALC pretty much 4-5 months after I started playing table tennis. I've been using it for 1.5 years now and my level has gone up tremendously BUT I'll be switching to a 5 ply wood blade (Butterfly Primorac) at the end of the month. When people were talking to me about having better ""feeling"" and ""control"" 1.5 years ago, I didn't understand what they were talking about, and even when I tried wood vs carbon I couldn't tell the difference because my strokes were so shit it didn't matter what blade I used.  However, ever since I got the TB ALC, I've basically been slowing down my setup. I was using Tenergy 05, then I switched to Rakza 9, then Rakza 7 and now Rakza 7 Soft. As my skill level has gone up, I've found that I value the ""control"" aspect much more than ""power"" and ""speed"". I've tried several wood blades (Primorac, Clipper, Emerald VPS, Violin, Acoustic, Barwell Fleet, yes my club loves Nittaku :P) and frankly every single one of them felt more ""right"" to me than my ALC did. Keep in mind that I've also tried many different carbon blades and also some stiffer wood blades (Sardius, Mazunov) and didn't like most of those at all, so this isn't just me imagining that my game would improve if I just had some other blade.  As someone who prefers to loop on FH/BH and play a heavily offensive game, I genuinely do wish I'd been convinced to try the Primorac earlier and stick to it. I liked the Nittaku Violin as well, but not enough to justify the price difference.  As for rubbers, the classic cheap but effective rubber is Yasaka Mark V."
tabletennis,3c03g9,RHAINUR,2,Fri Jul 3 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"The Clipper is a 7 ply, with very low dwell time. Strictly an offensive blade, very bad for chopping.   The Primorac is supposedly a fantastic intro blade to ""proper"" equipment but is rated off-, not perfect for chopping either.  To the OP: Either get a defensive blade, such as the Donic Defplay Senso or the Stiga Defensive NCT, or an allround blade, like the Stiga Allround Classic, or any other commonly recommended All- to All+ blade. As for rubber, I'd say something soft-medium hardness and not too thick, 1.5-1.8mm. Butterfly Tackiness C is a very popular chopping rubber, and 729 Super FX is a cheap chinese rubber that's quite soft and good for a first setup.  Just stay far away from anything Carbon or 7 ply at the very least."

tabletennis,3c03g9,sw2de3fr4gt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"For the ALC, I think you will need something that is medium hard and not too soft (~45 degree hardness). Typically, Butterfly blades go well with Tenergy but if you're not willing to spend to much, then have a look at things like Donic M2/M1/Barracuda, Joola Maxxx/Maxxx P, Xiom Omega/Vega. There's lots more but that's what I can think of off the top of my head.  That said, I don't think you should buy such an expensive racket for your first pro racket. Try things out in the $100 -$150 range and see what you like and what you don't like. Carbon blades are not that great for chopping. There are other blades out there that are specifically made for choppers."
tabletennis,3c03g9,jjharryk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:11:24 2015 UTC,Don't go blowing your budget on something expensive.  Just buy some Donic rubbers under $40.  Go to a local table tennis store (or look online) and look at the price ranges for rubbers and pick something in the middle range.

One interesting thing about table tennis at a higher level is that control actually has certain correlations to spin.  There are some different ways to defend in table tennis; over the table countering (like Koki Niwa or Kenta Matsudaira), pips blocking (I don't know of any pros who play like this, so like this guy.), and modern chopping (like most notably Joo Sae Hyuk).  The equipment changes drastically depending on which style you want to play.  Basically, the question is pips or inverted?  I'm not sure if you can find a pre-made paddle with a proper sheet of pips on it. Like I recommend to almost anyone on this subreddit, please consider getting a custom setup.

An actual defensive setup is definitely not something you want if you've been playing for 2 months, you won't even be able to use it because nobody around your skill level will be generating enough topspin to get decent chops in. Consider getting an ~ALL rated blade (dunno your budget, some of the nicer ones are Donic Appelgren Allplay, Yasaka Sweden Classic, and Butterfly Timo Boll ALL; don't forget to seal if you set this up yourself), some lower-power rubbers (729 Focus 3 Snipe 1.5mm on both sides is a good start without breaking the bank), and you'll be fine."

tabletennis,3boz4b,gnidmas,2,Wed Jul 1 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Hi,  A bit lengthy, so sorry for the wall of text.  In my experience anything decent(good control, not too hard rubber, some spin) is good enough. You'll have to worry about good forms and practices in the first place, and it certainly helps to get anything decent, no more or less.  I wouldn't recommend anything default you can find in a sports store (like rucanor  Or adidas I.e.), as these usually are slow, thin, too hard and virtually no spin. in competitions they are often not approved.  Any premade bat by a specialised table tennis brand (manufacturing seperate sheets) is decent for a beginner. Think butterfly,sonic, tibhar (better blades imho), joola, andro or stiga. They usually are of a bit better quality, spinnier, softer and a bit faster. Control usually decreases the faster a rubber gets (think slogans as ""build in glue effect"" , ""extra surface tension"" and obscure technologies which basically means they fit the top layer on the sponge under tension, which creates a kind of catapult effect), but usually the price will also increase. This also shows why a decent premade bat doesn't have to be expensive either: you don't want that crap ...yet. You want to get to know your playing style, need a bit of routine in your strokes. Yeah, it feels (and sounds, click !) great to hit the ball with a slight touch, but isn't funny when you're playing a match and all hits go Wide. You want to hit the table, you want to get know effects and how to do them or how to counter them, you want to learn to serve well, instead of litteraly walking miles to pick up balls. You want a bit of everything to try out. Pimples and anti-spin rubbers also have a lot of theory, which is fine, but later on because it will only distract if you don't know the what, the how and the why of these rubbers.  As an example, certainly not trying to spam: I'm assuming you're in the US: http://www.tabletennisdb.com/premade/butterfly-201.html Or : http://www.tabletennisdb.com/premade/butterfly-302-flared.html  Seems a bit faster (too be honest, I don't know of these are official ittf approved rubbers, however can't image they manufacturer wouldn't get them approved): http://www.tabletennisdb.com/premade/stiga-cygnus.html  Also this one seems decent: http://www.tabletennisdb.com/premade/yasaka-ma-lin-carbon-3-plus-ti.html  I tried to be as allround as possible with my suggestions and you'd hit your ""bat limit"" if you're getting better and more comfortable in your own games, thus later on. Maybe someone else has a good suggestion in here?  Having said that, I really really recommend just going to a club a couple of evenings, ask a spare bat (they usually have some decent for youth and train a few times. Maybe your style is more attack or you might be  a heavy defender. A trainer might be more knowledgeable and could read your playing style better after a few knocks. Or go to a store specialised in table tennis equipment. They usually have decent premade bats you can try a couple of knocks.  But you could skip the hard thinking about a tactical move, buy one from the links or cheaper site with these kind of combinations and start worrying about a new bat when this one start to annoy you.   Tldr: Premade bats from a specialised brand, allround in all aspects. Worry over a year when your bat start to annoy you, or a trainer gives you advice."

This is also table tennis. More footwork (at least on one side), more energy, actively opening up long balls and trying to flick some short ones.  Since you mentioned training, this is also table tennis. Multiball + footwork training. If you're not a fit person, 50-75 balls of this will make you want to use the table as a temporary bed.  I've tried to avoid professional/olympic level table tennis videos (Sabine Winter is a pro player but that kind of multiball training is extremely common) because obviously most of those players are just at another level of fitness. The point is table tennis can be very relaxed or very intense, and it's really hard to give a useful number of calories when the range is so large.

tabletennis,3aouwc,Kmon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly how many calories I burn per hour in table tennis but here are some of my stats.  Height: 5'10""  at the beginning of 2014 (Feb or so) I began utilizing table tennis as my only source of working out.  I started off with a body weight of about 210lbs. and I would play at a USATT level of 1300, meaning that I wouldn't really move too much during games because the points would not go on for more than 4-5 hits on average.  I would play perhaps twice a week for 1-2 hour sessions.  I would do running inbetween those table tennis days (no more than a mile a day). I also ate less and healthier, more fruits and vegetables. I did this for about 4 months and went down to about 190lbs.  Around August 2014 I met more friends to play table tennis with and also became a member at a club.  My training sessions became more rigorous and lasted longer. Now I play about 3 days a week with 4-5 hours sessions a day.  My skills improved and I was able to keep the point going for longer which helps keep your heart rate up.  I did this for another 3-4 months and lost even more weight. By the end of 2014, I weighed about 175lbs.  Now, I'm not so sure where my weight is at, but I'm assuming it hasn't changed very drastically since the beginning of this year. It should be about 170lbs.  Even though my activity and rating level has gone up significantly, I've hit a plateau for what table tennis can benefit me in terms of weightloss.  My next step would be to join a weight lifting gym and focus on that to get me the gains that I want.   TLDR; in the span of a year, I lost 35+ lbs. of weight mostly from Table Tennis."
tabletennis,3and5e,kamakie,2,Sun Jun 21 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"Non-marking soles if your club requires it. Normally any club with PVC/vinyl flooring will require it. Comfort for YOU. Everyone's feet and movement style are different.   Table tennis shoes are pretty much light tough shoes with a non marking, relatively thin sole (compared to say, basketball shoes). Indoor soccer shoes should work just fine (assuming the sole is non marking).  The main difference between table tennis shoes and regular shoes is the branding but I'm sure they'd have better build quality than some no-name brands. As long as you're comfortable and can move around though, it doesn't matter too much what shoe you're wearing."
tabletennis,3and5e,RHAINUR,2,Mon Jun 22 06:59:59 2015 UTC,"The older butterfly shoes were made by asics, but I think these newer ones may not be.  I personally think there is some difference between table tennis shoes and normal gym shoes or tennis shoes.  TT shoes tend to be lighter weight and give you some ankle support without hindering flexibility too much. If you don't have particularly strong ankles I wouldn't necessarily recommend them.  There are some good alternatives to TT shoes like volleyball, badminton, or indoor soccer shoes.  I know a couple of 2200+ players that wear Nike Gatos 2's for reference."

tabletennis,3akxdn,EliteEight,4,Sun Jun 21 05:19:08 2015 UTC,"Finding the ideal rubber requires a bit of trial and error, and depends on your style and which blade you're using. You mentioned that you're an offensive player but you didn't mention whether you tend to hit flat/hard fast shots or spinny shots, and whether you're offensive on FH only or FH and BH both.  Personally I went through the following over a period of 2 years  Mark V -> Mark V HPS -> Tenergy 05 -> Rakza 9 -> Rakza 7 -> Rakza 7 Soft  And I finally found that Rakza 7 Soft on my Timo Boll ALC felt extremely comfortable and suited my game very well. I play offensively on both FH/BH and like to apply a fair amount of spin to the ball with my attacks.  If you want any kind of sensible recommendations for rubbers to buy, you'll need to mention what your budget is, more details about your style, and what blade you're using. However, the overall answer to your question ""How do I know which rubber to buy?"" is that you don't know until you've tried several."
tabletennis,3akxdn,RHAINUR,2,Sun Jun 21 10:02:55 2015 UTC,"Fantastic answer! I use Timo Boll ALC myself, but haven't found the right rubber.

tabletennis,3a7xas,spartanatreyu,2,Wed Jun 17 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - the ball from your opponent needs to hit your side first before you can attempt to hit it.   I believe the ruling is that a ball struck by an opponent needs to touch your side of the table before you can then strike it. Smashes or volleys, like those in tennis which are struck by you before the ball hits the court, are illegal in table tennis. This would result in a point awarded to your opponent.   Taken from http://www.ittf.com/ittf_handbook/ittf_hb.html  THE RETURN 2.07.01 The ball, having been served or returned, shall be struck so that it passes over or around the net assembly and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.  Hope this helps.   Edit - spelling"

tabletennis,3a7xas,JTurtle,3,Wed Jun 17 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I hear you. But you have to let your opponents struck ball hit your side of the table before you can strike it.

In table tennis, you can cover the table a lot better with the forehand than the backhand.  b) I want to just play my style.  I don't really have much to offer here. Compared to Penhold/Seemiller/Pistol/Whatever grip, shakehand is probably the most accommodating to backhand oriented players.  Regardless of what you want to do, just like anything other habit you want to change, you just have to commit to that change until it becomes the new habit...

tabletennis,39mz05,not-a-fox,0,Sat Jun 13 18:04:38 2015 UTC,You should stand at the left half of the table if you are playing right-handed because your forehand reach is longer than your backhand reach.  Also you probably need a while to adjust to using shakehand grip by hitting more forehands.

tabletennis,393v3w,u2412m,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:40:22 2015 UTC,They differ so that the player you are playing against can see which rubber you are hitting the ball with. If you have a pip out rubber on one side there is a huge difference how the ball will act when you hit it compared to the other. So the player need to be able to tell that.    I can't say there is any manufacturer that has a difference between red and black but from what I know they don't. So just try the paddle and change sides and see what you prefer.

tabletennis,38y5b6,SDR3veNG,2,Sun Jun 7 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"Correct, you can see the second net if you pause the video around 9 seconds in ;-). It's a cool trick shot from that camera angle, nonetheless."

tabletennis,38t8re,poway112,3,Sat Jun 6 16:51:32 2015 UTC,Oh wow this also shows an edge shot on a serve and he gets the point. I had to spent a couple hours digging through forums to find the answer after reading the 27 page rule book that didn't mention it. This is the first time I've seen it in a video.
tabletennis,38t8re,Bread_Design,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:28:53 2015 UTC,So what's the rule? Why does he get the point?
tabletennis,38t8re,SmittyBand,3,Sun Jun 7 02:15:16 2015 UTC,"It was still technically ""playable"". The server gets the point on the serve even if it hits the edge. That is, top of the table edge, not the side, which is defined extensively in the rule book and judged by the way the ball bounces and the angle in which it hit the edge and leaves the edge.  Serves are really interesting and extremely important in this game. Someone had mentioned that almost 1/2 of all points come from the serve or the return, so getting your serve down is required. The serve is a let if you hit the net, but if you edge it's a point for the server. The rule book mentions the net, the placement of your serve, the angle in which you can throw the ball, how to hold the ball on the serve, and a couple other things, but it never actually mentions if you edge it. One rule I didn't know about, and which we don't play at work (the only place I play) is that if you toss the ball for a serve and miss, the opponent gets a point. We've always just replayed the serve because no one is professional here."
tabletennis,38t8re,Bread_Design,2,Sun Jun 7 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"I had a double-edge serve one time.. Nicked the corner on my side and skyed waay up, and then on the way down it hit corner again sending it far off to the side.  Best point ever."
tabletennis,38t8re,DavidPx,2,Sun Jun 7 14:22:40 2015 UTC,Incredible video. That backhand though... Wow
tabletennis,38ny8c,poway112,5,Fri Jun 5 13:11:17 2015 UTC,I think the top players are both clever and powerful.
tabletennis,38ny8c,Favidavid,3,Fri Jun 5 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"This. Ma long is not known as a power player within China, more of a tactical player. Zhang Jike, Fan Zhangdong are the power players in China.  A few month back, there was a photo of Ma Long in the locking room on social media. People was commenting on his relative lack of muscle compare to Zhang Jike. It was brought up in a post match interview, which he said he may lack strength, but he is more flexible and that is it's own strength.  By the way, it is true nowadays the sport favoring the more athletic players."
tabletennis,38ny8c,Vinar,2,Fri Jun 5 16:14:47 2015 UTC,Really? I would think that Ma Long is the power player and Zhang Jike is tactical. Why is that?  Edit: names
tabletennis,38ny8c,FTFYWithATypo,3,Fri Jun 5 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ma Long doesn't have nearly as much power away from the table as Zhang Jike does. Additionally, Ma Long is well known to borrow power, whereas Zhang Jike generates his own. (Relatively speaking.)  Honestly, this is extremely nuanced. Both players play at a very high level tactically as well."
tabletennis,38ny8c,ESTEEeFFY0U,2,Sat Jun 6 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"I've never paid too close attention to what the commentators say--but when I look at their games I would think the opposite instead of what you guys said.  It looks like ZJK is the control-type that borrows the power, plays closer to the table with shorter swings and dishes it back out while Ma Long is the relentless power player that steps a bit back, off the table, for a bigger swing and uses more of his own power to generate his shots.  The match that comes to mind that makes me think this way in particular is this one:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByUX0mOVjwg  edit: and by you guys I mean /u/Vinar and /u/FTFYWithATypo  the rally that really epitomizes these two players in my mind is at 6:46 and then some epic slow-mo of that rally entails afterwards."
tabletennis,38ny8c,FTFYWithATypo,5,Tue Jun 9 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, these two points are actually pretty different.   Difference #1: The two Chinese players.  Liu Guoliang turned the corner because he's a old school offensive penholder. Fan Zhendong is a two winged looper.  In other words, this means that LGL will typically turn the corner on the backhand side, and FZD will just loop with the backhand to open the attack.  Difference #2: Angle of the 2nd attack.  FZD is receiving, for all intents and purposes, a cross-table shot. LGL is receiving a down the line shot.  This opens up very different angles for the shot. Including the around the net shot that FZD choose.  Difference #3: Motherfuckin' Waldner  Prime Waldner is much much better than Niwa. Although it's hard to compare as the eras are different, Waldner won world championships among a sea of Chinese players. And during this era, he was absolutely the god of touch. A lot of people argue that even his contemporaries can't compare to him in his prime.  There are a few more differences, but I'm lazy.  Point is, I'm not sure if this point is an argument that touch is dead."
tabletennis,38ny8c,metarinka,2,Sat Jun 6 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"Game has changed a lot, the service rule changes, ball size change etc has focused the game more towards 2-wing loopers, there's only one defensive player in top 10 IIRC? and very few in top 100.  Only way to win these days is be a very strong very aggressive player."
tabletennis,38ny8c,HarderNotSmarter,2,Fri Jun 5 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"I believe this is all part of the natural evolution of table tennis as a sport. The touch shots are magical, and everyone loves them, but the player's goal is to win. A professional will seek the most reliable way to win, and, unfortunately, touch play is not reliable. Power, speed, and other physical attributes combined with the proper strategy is reliable. So, the professionals naturally gravitate towards that.   Table tennis not unique in this approach. Virtually all sports have had similar evolutions. Tennis, being relatively similar, is a good comparison. Even modern day masters of control such as Federer are being forced to play with more power, and struggle against Djokovic when he is blasting at every opportunity.    Table tennis is a physical pursuit. The end-game will naturally be physical prowess."

Paddle Palace sells a pro special with his blade and a similar rubber,  but it was a bit too powerful and I shot off the edge of the table a lot.  The LT spin rubber made it perfect."

tabletennis,38f68f,me0wtwo,3,Wed Jun 3 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Long pips are really really different. One option is to just order several long pips from eacheng.net, shipping is a bit much but you can try out a bunch of OX long pips for really really cheap (many great ones at ~$4 a sheet).  If you go that route, the Friendship 755 and Palio ck531a are definite autoincludes; for others you'll just have to read reviews and order what seems worth a try. (Be sure you seal your blade if you go this route!)  As for the forehand, than Focus III Snipe is really quite good for $10, I'd recommend that in 1.5 or 1.8 over Sriver.   For the blade...I dunno. I've heard the Galaxy N-9 is really really good for $10, it wouldn't be the worst idea to grab a couple of those and use them to compare between the pips."

I can see there being a problem with a Monopoly and overpriced tables/equipment.  But that usually goes with a Monopoly.  I am biased as I go to the local Killerspin House here in Chicago and get to play for just owning a cheap racket.  Good competition, people are nice, fun to play on some super expensive tables for free for the most part.  My love of the game and proximity to this location will not let me look at this subjectively."
tabletennis,38dbx2,ESTEEeFFY0U,3,Wed Jun 3 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"I wasn't the OP of that thread but I can see his point.  On a different note, I'm sure the club you go to is one of the best in this country so it may be a bit unfair to call KS a ""slimy and embarrassing"" company.  But when it comes to equipment, European, Japanese, and Chinese stuff is on the top by far on the price/performance scale.  Lastly, don't buy pre-mades, they're for filthy casuals... :)  Ok I realize that sounds snobby but it really doesn't make sense buying a pre-made when you can buy a custom setup and use it for the rest of your life by putting on fresh rubber every year or so instead of a one time use pre-made."
tabletennis,38cobz,poway112,5,Wed Jun 3 10:45:52 2015 UTC,"That is really surprising to me because when I look at German Bundesliga matches, they have bigger crowds than the Chinese Super League."
tabletennis,38cobz,ESTEEeFFY0U,3,Wed Jun 3 11:38:17 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the sport's popularity is declining even in Germany. Quite a number of clubs have problems finding talented kids to form the next generation of competitive players. However, there still are many many clubs (and shops!) where you can find others who play with you. And the fact that few people know Dima is largely du to the airtime  table tennis gets on German TV - close to none. The news will only cover the world cup or the Olympics maybe with a small article."
tabletennis,38cobz,luvustea,3,Wed Jun 3 11:42:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately Tabletennis and the professional players don´t enjoy the publicity they deserve in Germany, but it still is a fairly popular sport here.   There are certainly huge differences depending on the area you are in. A quick google search shows that you could train every thursday and friday in the club in Lüneburg and there are probably several other clubs around. In my region nearly every small town has an own Club, where people will gladly play with you (it´s only 2 and a half hours to my Club cough).  There should also be a shop around you somewhere, the farthest should be Hamburg.   So basically tabletennis is not a mainstream sport everyone knows about here, but we have many clubs and players, who are very passionate about it and you should be easily able to find them around you!"

tabletennis,38cobz,ESTEEeFFY0U,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"I think there are two big things to consider here.     The first one being, football (soccer) is the biggest sport by far. It doesn't leave much room for anything else. Your average person will know the national team plus most clubs from the Bundesliga, several coaches of said clubs and several players. Every other sport is miles behind that. If you have one really outstanding player, he will get noticed (Think Dirk Nowitzki for basketball, Jörg Rosskopf or Timo Boll for tabletennis, Boris Becker or Steffi Graf for Tennis). But that's it. They have to be absolutely stablished world class to be noticed by people who do not follow the sport. Boll has been at that level, Ovtcharov hasn't reached it yet (plus his name is probably a hindrance, Dimitrij is just not as simple and memorable as Boris, Dirk, Timo or Steffi). So essntially, football (soccer) takes up all the coverage and attention and only absolute world-class players from other sports get some attention.      Secondly, germany has a huge ""Vereinswesen"". A Verein is a club that is registered by the state and can be about anything. You can have a Verein for a sport, for gardening, for reading, for music, for charity, anything. They are really small scale organizations that people find to organize their hobbies and share them with like-minded people. My town of 1700 people has a football Verein, a tennis Verein, a tabletennis Verein, a catholic womens Verein, a carnival Verein, three dancing Vereine, two choir Vereine, a bowling Verein, a darts Verein. I think that's it. So Vereine are a huge thing in germany. We have more than 600.000 of them. So if you want to participate in a hobby, you join a Verein dedicated to that hobby.      As for shops, it's true. There aren't many. Most people order via the internet or via catalogue. Or maybe people use those means because there aren't many shops around. I don't know."
tabletennis,38cobz,umlaute,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, it's definitely not the same as football.  There aren't a lot of casual fans in the sport but quite a few good players. In the club that I go to, you don't really see casual players going there to enjoy yourself but mostly players who are serious about improving themselves (but still enjoy themselves :)). The structure for leagues and tournaments is also quite expansive here. I think there were 5 tournaments within a 100km radius in the last month.  I think that casual fans don't have much to gain from table tennis. You need to really have played table tennis with spin to appreciate watching the World Championships for example. A friend of mine keeps getting confused why table tennis players miss the ball or make unforced errors so often in comparison to tennis. A direct service point or a well placed long push would make us think ""Great serve!"" or ""Great placement!"" but a non-player would just say that it was a crappy point.  A lot of non players do know who Timo Boll or Jörg Rosskopf is. But I might have only asked 10 people so that's not a huge sample size.  The No. 2 ranking has a lot to do with Boll and recently Ovtcharov as well. I think that the Japanese or Korean players are slightly better on average, especially if you compare the women's teams."

tabletennis,38cobz,megaracerx,0,Thu Jun 4 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"The sport isn't even popular in China.  It was a much larger shock to me than Germany is for you.  In fact, the level of club players in the USA is similar or only slightly behind those in China.  I had a German friend here in Shanghai who I played with, and one thing he described about TT in Europe is that there is a more robust club/league organized play available to players of all levels.  I think this is superior to the tournament format we have in the US.  The French and German players here in Shanghai can know each other very quickly by saying which league they're in, which I think is a better measure than the rating system we use in the US.

tabletennis,3886gy,HonkyMahFah,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:21:19 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your intentions. If you are just playing for fun, it doesn't matter what you get. If you want to get better and intend on developing your strokes, perhaps eventually playing at a club, you want something you can grow into. The good thing about table tennis in comparison to other sports is that cheap equipment plays almost as good as the best, as long is it is from a good brand. While Stiga is a good brand, they also make hobby (crap) rackets for the casual American player. The bundle sets you linked are not good at all. The topsheet will more than likely peel away from the sponge rather quickly, the sponge probably does not act like real table tennis sponge, and you will not be able to replace the rubbers when they wear out. By getting the correct pre-assembled paddle, you're allowing yourself to upgrade/change the rubber in the future if you like. You're also allowing yourself to play the proper strokes. With the wrong equipment you will have to modify your strokes to compensate for the way the equipment plays, most often a flatter angle at contact and much less spin. So, to sum up, for fun, get anything, to get better, you need something that's not a hobby racket."
tabletennis,3886gy,Timoboll,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:07:00 2015 UTC,I use the Stiga Supreme and the Stiga Titan.   They are about 30 dollars a piece.   The first has its weight evenly distributed while the Supreme is a little top heavy.  I enjoy both.  What do you think about these for competition play?   I also use Stiga 3 star balls which are USATT approved.   Any suggestions or thoughts on these?  Recommendations?
tabletennis,3886gy,mystahead,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see the point in using a hobby racket when you could get a seriously good custom racket for around the same price. Real TT equipment can be cheap and can last a long time if well taken care of. If you are serious, then you should get a custom racket that fits your game style. If you're not sure what to get, there are lots of cheap rubbers to experiment with. Because you're able to put different rubbers on your blade, unlike the hobby rackets, you can change and customize until you find something you like. There are also forums where well-established members will sell rubbers that they tried for a few hours to you for a great discount. With the huge amount of choices at various price points, I don't see the point in buying a hobby racket. I can't comment on the balls as I have never used them."
tabletennis,3886gy,Timoboll,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"I just started playing competitively and have always used hobby paddles.  I don't know what kind of blade or rubber to use.  I use power with my forehand and a quick wrist flick for my backhand.  How will the rubber affect my serve?   I've been practicing the pendulum and the reverse pendulum.   Also, what are good balls to use?  The reason I use Stiga 3 stars is because they got good reviews.   Should I go for the seamless balls?  I want my equipment to be tournament approved.  I've been playing/practicing 3 hours a day 5 days a week since last September and I notice a remarkable improvement.   The only problem is I play the same 4 or 5 people as the closest TTC is over an hour away.  I need more competition and training, so I've debated starting an informal TTC to get started.  I just don't know what kind of following I would get."
tabletennis,3886gy,mystahead,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say without seeing your strokes. Are you trying to emulate pros/ping skills with your strokes? The problem with hobby paddles is that you might have to adapt your strokes to the paddle, and you may form bad habits. A lot of times due to the deadness of the sponge and the lack of spin generation strokes become more tennis like. Better rubber would most likely allow you to spin the ball more. As for the balls, I can't say anything on the Stiga balls. If you notice no issue, don't worry about it. However, eventually the celluloid will be banned and not tournament approved. Many members at the club I go to have started to use the plastic 40+ ball. Good on you for practicing and improving, keep it up! Ask the people you play with if they would be interested in helping start the club and get people interested. Try posting on your local cities subreddit about it."
tabletennis,3886gy,Timoboll,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"I think the paddles are part of the problem.   I've been using the same ones for 9 months.  I've noticed that it is hard to put a lot of spin on the ball.  I think I will go online and order one pre-assembled but with interchangeable rubber.  I don't know what rubber use though as the paddles I use have sponge between the rubber and blade.  The video was good but my forehand is more straight,  like a baseball swing.  I want to have good technique because I realize my potential is good and I'm going to go as far as I can with the sport.  As for starting a club, I've thought about going to the local bar with a table and having a little tournament,  just to see what kind of following I can get.   That way it is minimal investment if there isn't a large following.   I've been looking at places to rent in good locations but I don't want to invest a lot of time and money if no one shows up.  I've got ideas but I need to talk to reps from Stiga, Butterfly,  Killerspin,  etc to get some equipment.   As for determining the rubber I should use, who do I talk to or see that could help me?"

tabletennis,386xkk,gross04,3,Tue Jun 2 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Just be aware of your opponent's weaknesses and try to exploit it. Like if they favour their backhand more, and their forehand is weak, put 90% of your serves and shots against the forehand.   If your opponent is on a streak, don't be afraid to slow the game down by taking extra time between points, toweling off every 6 points, and save your timeouts for critical moments!     MOST IMPORTANTLY - Go out there and have fun! You've got nothing to lose :)"

I always stand a bit away from the table with one hand in the air until I'm ready.  Bring a banana and honey for if you run out of energy. Screw those powerbars!  Stay on your toes and move your feet!  If your opponent loses the point; set them up for the same thing every now and then until they correct it.  Have fun!
tabletennis,386xkk,lazynothin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"Variety!  On your serves, alternate between fast, slow, medium speed.  And vary the placement between long and short, but mostly, you serves should be short.  Also, vary the spin (side/under, etc)"

I was lucky getting involved because the guys who ""coached"" me took it easy enough on me at first to get me interested but never let me win. I'm naturally competitive so it was only a matter of time. We play mostly at a bar, not a club, so the women who play are either already good, or just drunkenly ""oh we want to play!"" The latter frustrate me to no end and I don't try recruiting them."

tabletennis,37wvs4,floppysnorkel,10,Sun May 31 15:20:35 2015 UTC,"Politically very incorrect answer:     Because girls usually don't put in the same effort as boys. I've been coaching for several years now and while most boys would be pissed if they lose, tried to go for the point at every chance (often resulting in very poor shots, of course) and generally wanted to win, I had not a single girl come in with the same attitude. Most considered playing a topspin ""unfair"", giggled around and usually simply stopped playing with someone if he was better and refused to just play the ball back and forth to no end. After learning a new serve, one girl told the boy to ""stop trying to be cool"" by using it. Talking to the other girls was way more important than the sport itself. Every. Single. Time.      I tried separating the groups and making all-girl and all-boy groups. I tried making the training sessions less competitive for the girls. I tried bringing in a female coach to do the training with the girl group. All had the same effect, nothing.      Talking to other coaches, it's the exact same situation in other clubs."
tabletennis,37wvs4,umlaute,3,Sun May 31 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"FWIW, at a recent tournament I competed in there were two girls (ages 9 and 13) who had a USATT rating north of 2000. They were incredible.  There was also a 77 year old woman who easily won her age bracket.  Your observation that girls are taking the sport less seriously (with the described attitudes, I wonder why they're playing at all...) my guess would be it's cultural rather than anything to do with the sport.  Changing cultural attitudes is quite a bit more difficult..."
tabletennis,37wvs4,hexarin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, I completely agree with that it's more cultural than anything. And I had the same experience. The few girls who play are usually really good. Definitely above the average male player.       But that makes sense. There are a few tournaments here with the sole purpose of having the state coach take a look at the kids and select a few for a training group. Go there as a boy and you'll have a 1:50 chance of being picked. Lots of competition. Go there as a girl and you'll be picked unless you obviously don't give a fuck or are exceptionally bad.      There are resources (coaching, tournaments, training groups) available specifically for both genders. But while there are a lot of boys playing and only a few girls playing, the few girls are much more likely to get a very high quality training than the vast majority of boys. Of course this would change once there were more girls playing the sport."
tabletennis,37wvs4,umlaute,2,Tue Jun 2 22:04:27 2015 UTC,I am a woman who plays.  I play a lot at a brewery here.   I would love to join a club but I'm not sure how competitive it is.   Specifically for the local club I would like to go observe first if it was allowed but there is nothing stating that you can on the website and the way it is worded seems a bit too uptight/intimidating to me.   Ping pong is my favorite activity and I don't want to lose the enjoyment I get out of it so I'm hesitant to go because of that.
tabletennis,37wvs4,floppysnorkel,1 point,Sun May 31 06:58:00 2015 UTC,"It's completely worth doing.      A few years ago I played an exceptionally bad season. Something like 7 wins and 20+ losses. I was shy and really awkward. But I had to find a place to improve, and my local club didn't have the players and coaches necessary for that. So I started just visiting clubs in the area (every other town has a tabletennis club here). Just went there when training started and asked if I could just play a bit without joining. Within a month I was regularly visiting three different clubs to train at regularly. Nobody ever said that I had to join immediately (or at all).        During the next season my rating went from about 1150 to 1350 and the next two year it went from 1350 to about 1500.       Keep in mind that clubs usually want new members and making people sign up without allowing them to take a look first is a shitty method of winning new members. Seriously, if a club turns down or is rude to someone who might join later on, it's a shitty club that will self-destruct in the near future."
tabletennis,37wvs4,umlaute,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:14:52 2015 UTC,Thanks yeah I definitely think I will.  Good point on the clubs.  There weren't many near me last time I checked but the popularity of the game seems to have improved here so hopefully it won't be an issue.
tabletennis,37wvs4,floppysnorkel,2,Wed Jun 3 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"I heard the gender ratio among causal player is much closer. So the focus should be transforming causal players to serious players.  For example, this article talking about causal table tennis: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/11591576/Not-just-for-hipsters-ping-pong-bounces-back.html   Unlike traditional sports, which frequently exclude women, ping pong has seen almost equal take-up by both genders; 40pc of Pongathon’s players are female   It seems causal players does have better gender balance.  By the way   according to Leigh. “There’s no specialist equipment required, and students can drop in, so it’s a really great way for them to socialise and be active at the same time.”    Hahaha...... $70 Tenegry, $120+ blades...
