EverythingScience,3dxpi3,pnewell,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:11 2015 UTC,Seems like a good idea.
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,falloutjunkie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think that Canidates should discuss science because science is prevalent in everyday life and Certain decisions that a politician might need to make could be influenced on their scientific knowledge. HOWEVER, in order for a Presidential Candidate to discuss science to America, Americans need to have scientific knowledge to understand which they do not. Our society has very little scientific knowledge and if you don't believe me, look it up. Before we focus on the Presidential Candidates discussing science, we should focus on getting the general public to learn about science."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,DJKVape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"How do you expect the candidates to respond? ...as if they are scientists themselves, in contrasting competing interests, or in broad strokes?   Potentially this is huge in terms of grants and research, and even the possibility of a scientist in the Oval Office  -  but such a person would be a neophyte in political terms and would likely be damaging for the country."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,gborroughs,-13,Tue Jul 21 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"Why is this post not being deleted?  The way politics distorts science MIGHT be relevant to r/everythingscience, but the influence of sciemce ON POLITICS certainly isn't.    Further, this post has a clear one-sided political agenda: a focus on climate science which is a left-wing agenda-item, but not on clearing big-business products like GMOs from restrictive and unscientific lable laws... a right-wing agenda item.   r/enerythingscience is NOT meant to serve as a megaphone for any one political agenda."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,Lucretius,12,Mon Jul 20 14:39:41 2015 UTC,The GMO issue you mentioned is not a right-wing topic. It's science vs. anti-science.
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,BevansDesign,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:12:00 2015 UTC,One man's anti-science is another man's political issue.
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,Lucretius,7,Mon Jul 20 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"climate science which is a left-wing agenda-item   False. Climate change is a question of human survival.   r/enerythingscience is NOT meant to serve as a megaphone for any one political agenda.   The political implications of scientific matters are unavoidable because the people who are affected by them are making it an issue. Not only that, they are coming after you. They want your job. They want your tenure and they have spent millions on efforts to eliminate good science from academia. They see science as a threat to their political power so should they gain power they will not hesitate to do everything they can to eliminate that threat."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,no_en,5,Mon Jul 20 13:47:00 2015 UTC,How science is handled by politicians isn't relevant to (everything)science?   And how does it have an agenda? It's just asking experts whether and what kind of science questions should be part of the presidential campaign.   I'm at a loss as to what your problem with this is.

EverythingScience,3dxpi3,bellcrank,8,Mon Jul 20 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe try actually reading the piece? The second 2/3rds of the story don't even mention climate change.   And sorry, but acknowledging the science on climate change isn't a political agenda."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,allonsyyy,7,Mon Jul 20 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"Conservatives are anti-science.  That isn't science's fault, it's the fault of politics.  What is the purpose of censoring content on science and society because one of the major US political parties has decided it isn't real?"
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,micromonas,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"The article is about climate science, not GMO labeling. They're not even vaguely, tangentially related."
EverythingScience,3dxpi3,allonsyyy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:42 2015 UTC,"they are related in the sense that GMO labeling and climate change denial can be essentially defined as a conflict between scientific consensus on one side, and scientific ignorance (often relying on emotional appeal) on the other"
