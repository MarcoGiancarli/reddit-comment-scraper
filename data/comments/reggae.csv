It seems like he's pushing his vocal cords in music recorded and even live with Rebelution.   Here he is with the band sounding a bit vocally stressed   http://youtu.be/WpMobGOrRgs

You can either palm mute the strum, or not mute on your left hand by only pressing down the chord for the last Downstroke. I find the latter much easier.  Also, the muted strums are not only muted, but he seems to strum them a little quieter and not all of the strings. He strums on the last down, with a little more force, just to emphasize. He's just trying to get the rhythm going.  There's a turnaround rhythm, but he sorta of plays around with it. It only lasts for one measure, so you could play anything in that measure. I'll leave that for you to figure out."

reggae,3bn3o1,Dubliminal,2,Tue Jun 30 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"People are listing artists, which is handy, but another way of exploring sounds is to go by record label and/or producer. These were often associated with their sound systems too. Here's a shortlist of the top players:   Studio One & Sir Coxsonne Dodd :my personal favourite and often considered the Motown of JA. Treasure Isle & Duke Reid: Studio One's main rival in terms of releases and sound system. Bunny Lee (no fixed abode): responsible for feeding tracks to Tubby to dub the shit out of.  Dynamic Sounds & Byron Lee : Many of the big names in this thread recorded here at one time or other. Channel One & Hookim Brothers .. and Sylvan Morrison:  Kinda took over where Studio One dropped the ball. Home to a swathe of recordings from '75-'85. Quality.  Ariwa & Mad Professor: UK dub genius and all round nice guy.

reggae,3bh4k4,Sackyhack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"I am one of the biggest Matisyahu fans ever.  I went to see him in Cleveland back in 2011 when he still had his beard. Let me tell you, that part you mentioned about radiating good energy is spot on. The dub trio, for three people, sounded like soundtrack for God.  When Matis came out on stage, he was wearing a white hoodie and white yamaka. His beard hid his face in way that immortalized his presence. He appeared to be holy being singing praise in the light of his majesty. It was truly a religious experience for me.   I saw him a few years later in Columbus and he had shaved his beard and dressed like a record company would want him to dress and it just wasn't the same. I got on stage with him though, and he turned around and slapped me daps as soon as he finished his One Day encore which made up for it."

reggae,3bh4k4,bushwoodband,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:29:23 2015 UTC,"Love the story, thanks for sharing!  So my band Bushwood was booked to open up for Matisyahu Unplugged (just with his guitarist Aaron Dugan) at this Benefit event in North Miami Beach, FL. We were sound-checking one of our songs a few hours before the show, and all of the sudden Matisyahu walks up and we all notice him nodding his head to our jams. So we finish up on stage, and next thing we know Matis' tour manager comes up to us and says ""Matis really likes your guys' style. Would you be down to lend us your rhythm section to back him for a couple songs?"" We immediately said YES! we're in. So he told us the 2 songs were ""King Without A Crown"" and ""One Day"". Luckily I knew the 'King' bass line from listening to him when he first came out. We pulled up 'One Day' on YouTube and listened behind the stage for the chord changes. 10 minutes later, Matisyahu himself invites us up to soundcheck with him & Aaron Dugan because he wants to play the songs 'differently than the recordings'. It all goes really well and we couldn't believe it was happening, then he says these songs will be his encore, see ya later, and he disappears. We played our set, he did his, and then this happened. He spontaneously went from ""One Day"" into Bob Marley's ""No Woman No Cry"" into one of his older songs ""Close My Eyes"". All unplanned, but over the same groove. It was a beautiful moment I won't soon forget, and one of the many reasons I picked up a bass in the 1st place, to be part of something like this. Music is a gift that keeps on giving.  My band's website if you're interested: http://BushwoodBand.com  TLDR; My band Bushwod jammed as Matisyahu's backing band for a few songs!"

reggae,3a5ssf,D-Mass,4,Wed Jun 17 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"It's mainly a tradition upheld by UK sound systems from what I've seen.  Jamaican independence in 1962 opened the floodgate for immigration from JA to the UK. UK sound systems were just one step behind JA so the tradition is deeply rooted. I ran a 3 hour set recently on my weekly DJ gig with just one turntable, chat pon the mic while i'm swapping sides. Next week I have a guest DJ who only plays on 1 turntable. He has lots of effects and oscillators to spice up the mix. He is so good at it, you don't really notice there is only one TT. Heavy jump up steppers vibes."

They've heard the songs, they might like some of them even, but they're more likely to be playing current music. I could be wrong, though -- my experience in the Caribbean was back in 2005. Contemporary reggae by people like Lutan Fyah, Sizzla, Capleton, or Tarrus Riley is also quite popular, and there's an overlap between some of them and the dancehall scene crowd. Someone else would have to weigh in about how popular real ""roots"" reggae with heavy Rastafari themes is among Jamaican youth who aren't also Rasta."

Beyond basketball, and 324 pairs of shoes, the single most important thing i took away was advancing gender equality through basketball. being able to teach a young girl, then a teenage girl, and then their mothers, (and then thier male counterparts) that if you can play, as a coach, i don't care what gender you are; you BELONG. that creation of a safe place to play, to grow, to be equals, was incredible.   https://vimeo.com/110319868  oneteamonedream"

reggae,3936oc,slopduck,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, both Monty Alexander and Ernie Ranglin are Jamaicans who have had very successful Jazz and reggae careers, and spent much of the late 90s/early 00s putting out albums that blended the two.  There is an album on Studio 1 called ""Reggae Au Go Jazz"" where Roy Burrowes and Clifford Jordan play over Studio 1 rhythms.   If you're not already familiar with Rico Rodriguez, you must check out ""Man From Wareika"", an album from the late 70s that was issued in the US on Blue Note.    I'm never been a big fan of his sound, but one early crossover was Herbie Mann's ""Reggae"" and ""Reggae II"" albums from the mid 70s might be worth checking out.    In the early 90s some big names in the UK scene created a band called Jazz Jamaica, the line-up evolved over the years but they put out a half dozen albums or so. A fair amount of ska in their set, but they dabbled in reggae as well.  I've never heard it, but I know a group recorded a version of ""Kind Of Blue"" in a reggae style a couple years back, that might be worth tracking down."

Two of the albums you mention are reissued on the Blood and Fire label, check more of that label. Also look at more Studio One Treasure Isle. Here are a few names to seek -  Earl Sixteen, Al Campbell, Joe Higgs, The Gladiators, The Heptones, The Mighty Diamonds. And for something newer, go get Bitty McLean - On Bond Street. He is on tour with Sly and Robbie right now and you might have a chance to catch one of the best singers today."

You've had some good responses already, but can't emphasize enough these others if you're looking for soulful lead singers and great harmonies from the 70's.  These are many of my faves:  Abyssinians, Congos (Jacob Miller!), early Itals & Might Diamonds, Culture, Wailing Souls Beres Hammond, Burning Spear, Glen Washington (one of the best!), Israel Vibration, Pablo Moses, The Gladiators, The Meditations.  That's enough to keep ya busy, I'd imagine.  Or try some classic Lover's Rock, you'll find some smooth melodies here with:  Gregory Isaacs, Sanchez & Dennis Brown  Newer Soulful Voices:  Romain Virgo and Tarrus Riley"

They finally find him and they film the dub being cut. Too bad Mikey Dread narrates over it the whole time.   Man I would love access to that multitrack for sure. It's probably in some London attic in a box right now.

The word hirsiz means burglar so there is a word play going on where Gitar Hirsizlari (Guitar burglars) actually means Guitar players.  the second song is a critique towards the Turkish government in a way. There have been reports and scandals of the vice president stealing money from the country and everything.

reggae,35h9jf,Jimmyturbo,7,Sun May 10 10:06:38 2015 UTC,"The Snoop Lion album is certainly not terrible, but it does come off a bit disingenuous.  The production is easily the strong point of the album with producers like Supa Dups, Dre Skull, Zion I Kings and of course Major Lazer handling the majority.  Many decent background riddims and beats - very few outright bad tracks (""Get Away"" being the only egregious misstep IMO).  Pretty much every style of reggae music is touched upon through one track or another (roots, dancehall, ska, dub, etc.).  The vocal side of things is less encouraging.  Snoop's vocals range from tolerable (""Fruit Juice"") to cringeworthy (""La La La"").  He definitely is more at home on the tracks where he is chatting rather than singing.  The many guest spots also present two major problems: either being wholly forgettable (Drake, Akon) or completely surpassing Snoop's own (Mr. Vegas, Jahdan Blakkamoore).  Overall this isn't really a reggae album as it is Snoop's homage to the genre. I think the album (and Snoop's whole ""Reincarnated"" saga) reeks of an artist who had a cool trip to the island, came back enamored with reggae music and wanted to use his creativity and clout to see what he could do with it.  Snoop pretty much dropped the Snoop Lion persona after this release and has gone on to experiment in other genres (funk and R&B most notably) so that's why I said it felt really disingenuous and mostly forgettable.  Best track - ""Fruit Juice"" (but only because of the Sleng Teng riddim and Mr. Vegas)"
reggae,35h9jf,SokaJunkie,1 point,Sun May 10 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the proper response, and I can say that i relate to a few of your opinions on the album it definitely is snoop paying homage to reggae, rather than real reggae. I also agree that Fruit Juice is the best track on the album. I only listened to it in the first place because i was bored this morning and watched the documentary of the making of it on netflix. I'll say that I enjoy it in a different way than I do the wailers or damien marley ect.  edit: I'm also a pretty big major lazer fan, which might explain why I like it so much."
reggae,35h9jf,Josefus,1 point,Sun May 10 14:58:08 2015 UTC,Sidenote but i would like to ask your opinion on Eddie murphy ft. snoop - Red light. It feels a lot more like genuine reggae.
reggae,35h9jf,SokaJunkie,2,Sun May 10 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Not Op obviously. But, personally, I love that track. I just feel like Snoop should have stayed home that day. He didnt really bring anything to the table on that one, imo."
reggae,35h9jf,Oceans_And_Plains,1 point,Sun May 10 17:01:49 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly with that statement, that song is all about eddie. Goddamn that guy is talented, I knew he could sing but wow..."
reggae,35h9jf,dabigmanating,2,Sun May 10 19:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of ""Redlight"" and even moreso of his recent ""Oh Jah Jah"".  Eddie's tracks work for two reasons: 1) He sticks to what he's good at.  Murphy has a long history of making R&B music, and he's a decent singer so he seems natural over pop-reggae tracks like those.  2) He keeps it fairly conservative.  His tracks aren't trying to blend different genres or dabble in different styles.  Good live instrumentation backing-track, female backup singers, and cliched but convincing reggae/rasta lyrics.  I think these are two things Snoop failed at.  He didn't play to his strong suits (rapping or chatting rather than singing) and there are so many styles throughout his album that is comes off as some wacky fusion reggae experiment."
reggae,35h9jf,mrtrentster,2,Sun May 10 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"I know most will say that it's bad, and not real reggae but I really like it. I listen to a lot of types of music not just reggae. If that's what you want, pure reggae then you won't find it on there. But if you just want some good stuff to hear from Snoop that isn't his same old stuff (which is still good) then give it a listen. He's actually digging pretty deep in some of the lyrics and also if you watch the documentary you'll get a good laugh.  tl;dr  I dig it Edit: let's ask u/here_comes_the_king"
