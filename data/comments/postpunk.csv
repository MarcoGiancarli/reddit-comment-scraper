The press is fucking disgusting sometimes. I'm not surprised by it at all, but I'm still bothered (probably more than I should be, considering the lack of shock) that there's been pictures taken of Nick and his wife visiting the memorial that was set up by where Arthur died. They're going thru the worst thing that any parents could have to deal with, and can't even grieve without some fucks thinking ""Hmm, I wonder what would get us some page views?

I've definitely seen Twin usage in old live videos. The pickups on his Microfrets guitar look like P-90s but I could of course be wrong there too.

postpunk,3c456p,foetus_lp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"Urgh! A Music War:       Urgh! A Music War is a British film released in 1982 featuring performances by punk rock, new wave, and post-punk acts, filmed in 1980. Among the artists featured in the movie are Magazine, The Go-Go's, Toyah Willcox, The Fleshtones, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, X, XTC, Devo, The Cramps, Oingo Boingo, Dead Kennedys, Gary Numan, Klaus Nomi, Wall of Voodoo, Pere Ubu, Steel Pulse, Surf Punks, 999, UB40, Echo & the Bunnymen and The Police. These were many of the most popular groups on the New Wave scene; in keeping with the spirit of the scene, the film also features several less famous acts, and one completely obscure group, Invisible Sex, in what appears to be their single public outing.

postpunk,3bwu7r,muslinbrotherhood,4,Fri Jul 3 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how Nick Cave has gotten far more popular than the artists he has worked with. Musicians like Mick Harvey, Blixa Bargeld and Rowland S. Howard. I think that they are just as talented and I personally even find RSH and BB's work much better, yet they are completely unknown in comparison to Cave. Don't get me wrong I still think that Nick is a great artist and I know the whole story with The Boys Next Door, then Birthday Party and then The Bad Seeds but can someone tell me how exactly did Cave get so much more recognition?  I mean almost everybody in my friend circle knows who Nick Cave is, even if they have never heard of the term post-punk, and I know some massive Nick Cave fans who don't know Rowland S. Howard.  Is it just that Neubauten were first too harsh and for a long time sung only in German and that RSH has fallen a bit behind because of drug problems?"

postpunk,3beskb,SlackBadger,-3,Mon Jun 29 04:33:31 2015 UTC,"I think I have made my own decision as to what post punk is, for me its music which directly inspired by 76-78 punks, not an imitation of it, but simply inspired by it, art school sort of attitude, so that could verge off into industrial music or hardcore or nowave or darkwave, with a good sense of rhythmn, its not just music, its artists, writers and film makers, photographers, and you can take a step back and look at the influences of many of these musicans and you can find William Burroughs or Lou Reed.  i would say that from 78-84 there was a real rennasissance of that classic postpunk sound, in NYC, London, Berlin and a few other places, but there were plenty of bands outside of those locations and points in time."
postpunk,3beskb,SlackBadger,5,Mon Jun 29 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hence your posting of songs that while very cool, are not post-punk. I'm not faulting your taste, only your interpretation of what the genre is."

As I often post, I'd love to put up Pixies songs, or Thin White Rope, or a dozen other awesome bands, but I just don't think that they are post-punk, but rather are alt/indie/experimental etc.... To me, post-punk in it's original form is either music that was inspired by the 1976 explosion of punk (ie the Sex Pistols show at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester) or music inspired by the NYC art-punk scene of the mid-70's (ie Talking Heads, Television)."

Ok. Don't post on subreddits devoted to one genre then. If you're ""enlightened and don't see genre"" you can always just post this to /r/experimentalmusic and be done with it. Not to pigeonhole you.

He got close to post punk with the Smiths films and Last of England (Jubilee was a film that had a punk theme). Caravaggio is about a renowned gay artist from the Baroque period.

postpunk,36dbih,Noughiphiet,4,Tue May 19 01:43:17 2015 UTC,Hard one. New wave does not necessarily mean post punk. There are times when they are near identical styles but came to it from a different approach. Bit like that weird evolution thing when completely different species come up with the same solution. Then there are things that seem so removed but you know just fit in. And there are plenty of fellow travellers that are not exactly post punk but you know they have a part. It's down to judgement though at the end of the day it is really about is this tune good.
postpunk,36dbih,weblypistol,2,Mon May 18 14:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't really consider bands like X or X-Ray Spex post-punk, mostly because they were so early in their respective scenes (X-Ray Sex in England, X on the American West Coast).   To make things more weird, I'd consider Essential Logic to be post-punk even though it's just Lora Logic's band after X-Ray Spex, and they sound very similar to me (maybe not as brash).  Then you have those bands who I consider ""Post-punk"" now, but that didn't start off post-punk. Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees, Killing Joke, and Siekiera were all bands I'd consider punk in their earliest incarnations, or with their first albums, who I feel eventually evolved into ""post-punk"". I'd probably throw Wire on that heap as well. I consider Pink Flag a punk album.  A lot of this probably depends upon the date or era the band came out, or the other bands they were associated with (rather than any real delineation). I've heard people call a lot of anarcho bands like Crass, Rudimentary Peni, Zounds, Flux of the Pink Indians, Honey Bane, etc. ""post-punk"", and when I first got into punk in the early 90s, I don't know anyone who ever used that label to describe them. In fact, I don't think I ever heard the label ""post-punk"" used of any bands till maybe 1999 or later. I'm sure they rarely used it of themselves. I imagine most people just considered bands we consider post-punk today as either ""punk"", ""college rock"", or maybe ""alternative"". I know there are articles with bands calling themselves ""post-punk"" or ""positive punk"" early on, but I can't imagine they were popularly used labels."
postpunk,36dbih,adrift98,3,Mon May 18 19:16:50 2015 UTC,I love X Ray Spex yet they are firmly punk. However a family member tried to impress me with Le Tigre who have a bona fide pedigree in post punk with Bikini Kill association . Just sounded like a rip off to me. Yet That is post punk but X Ray Spex are not?
postpunk,36dbih,weblypistol,1 point,Mon May 18 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"See I don't really consider Bikini Kill post-punk :D. I consider them Riot Grrrl, or just regular...punk. Le Tigre isn't as easy to classify. I'd consider them alternative maybe. Maybe post-punk. :) labels are fun lol."
postpunk,36dbih,adrift98,1 point,Tue May 19 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"Good points. Sure, X's style is not very Punk, like Television, they contain more classical rock arrangements and riffs etc., yet they are often credited as post-punk. I can see the opinions differ very much after reading the comments here. To mee, Post-Punk sound contains a lot of punk rock, which is definitely the case in X-Ray-Spex.   So, Post-Punk = Punk Rock + Avantgarde, new things, new asthetics etc., in my opinion. Also, the time is considerable, as you mentioned Bikini Kill / Le Tigre below are from the Riot Grrrl era, which is based on a different spirit and with other intentions etc.  Really interesting genre and scene, as there is clearly no fixed space and scheme to classify. It seems to describe the time and changes between Punk explosion and New Wave (or 80s Alternative?) better than any description of sound and such."
postpunk,36dbih,adrift98,1 point,Tue May 19 08:03:29 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I do think that X and X-Ray Spex ARE punk, but that they are NOT post-punk. Just reiterating, because I don't think I worded myself very well.  I see what you mean by considering post-punk = Punk+Avantgarde, but I can't help but feel that timing is more important than that. Think about all of the first wave punk bands and how diverse their sound was: Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Damned, The Stranglers, The Clash, Buzzcocks, The Voidoids, and that's before we even get to the West Coast bands. Lot's of variation here. So, while I agree that a change in sound and focus is important to what post-punk is, I can't help but think that timing is everything, which, I suppose, makes sense of a label like POST-punk. We don't call Television, The Talking Heads, Blondie, Patti Smith, Suicide, etc. ""post-punk"" (well, I don't anyways).  I think probably the most important thing to take away from these sorts of conversations is that labels are applied retroactively. A lot of these bands never thought of themselves as ""post"" anything, I don't think. And the label itself is relatively late, unlike the label ""Punk"" which found itself being slapped on bands around the same time punk broke.  Unfortunately, there probably will be no agreement among fans about what is and what isn't punk and post-punk. I think we all know that we like roughly the same type of music: Punk with a bit more depth and artsiness to it. :)"

postpunk,33pnbo,FIDLAAR,2,Fri Apr 24 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"Corners - Love Letters  Their whole album Maxed Out On Distraction is great.  They sound very reminiscent of Joy Division & New Order but with a mix with West Coast, Surf vibe and minus the depressive aspect.  Listen to Pressure by Corners as well. Also Buoy is good with the three interchanging vocalists; one of them sound very much like Ian Curtis. Check The Spaceship."
postpunk,33pnbo,sebfaure,3,Fri Apr 24 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, the postpunk surf sound reminds me of DIIV."
postpunk,33pnbo,FIDLAAR,4,Fri Apr 24 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"This is a cross-post from another comment. But here is some of my suggestions to some Joy Division/ New Order influence songs. I have even made a work-in progress playlist of songs that sound reminiscent of JD & NO.  Here is the playlist link; it doesn't have that much variety of artists, mostly comprised of New Order/ Joy Division songs, but I am still working on it.  Here are some of my favorites of the list and the highlights worth noting.  Johnny Aries - This Grave is My Bed Tonight   Inspired by The Smiths melody & got the melancholic feel of The Cure; Video is pretty entertaining as you can see that the singer even got that Robert Smith vibe and even down to that cheesy 80s dance like Robert Smith & Morissey. I also really like his previous work with his old band (Two Wounded Birds); its 50s rock/ Elvis/ Surf punk/ Ramones  inspired (they got the whole Ramones look down as well) .   Broncho - Class Historian    Very catchy, earwormy sound with that do-do-do-do; song is about a high school reunion and hooking up with those ""single mamas"" at the reunion.   Bos Angeles - Days of Youth   Dark post-punk with a touch of Surf Punk; vocals sound similar to the deadpan, emotionless quality of Ian Curtis.   Bos Angeles - Beach Slalom   Same description as above but vocals sound less deadpan and melody is uplifting for a post-punk band.   Bos Angeles - All I Do Is Dream   Very uplifting, and whenever I listen to this, it just makes me feel happy and optimistic of the future. You can not listen to this on my Spotify link because it has not been released on it yet. Otherwise they have only one album released so far and its free.     Before I intro these songs, I want to say how much I fkn love Corners (an upcoming new post-punk act of LA with a touch of West Coast / Surf Punk influence). As a huge Joy Division/ New Order fan, it just makes me love them even more and appreciate their work. Also, each of the members of Corners are talented individually and had put out music of their own that are all unique from each other. As a band, they got a sick look (& sick hair) and very Joy Division look with the button ups tucked in and rolled up.   In terms of similarity with Joy Division/ New Order (early Movement era):    Their songs got a similar melancholic, romantic lyrics of Ian Curtis (though it is not as depressing, there are some uplifting songs). They got a similar atmospheric feel like Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and New Order's Movement (that echo Martin Hannett produce in each album). The singer's vocals is pretty dynamic (sounds different in various songs). Three of the band members can sing as well providing some variety to some songs (Buoy). Similarity-wise, in some songs, singer sound very much like Ian Curtis but with an oomf of surfiness/ West Coast vibe (Pressure) or like Movement era Bernard Sumner. That infamous Peter Hook bass that became a core New Order and Joy Division sound; well, Corners got it. In couple songs (or maybe most), the bass act as a very upbeat surf-punkish rhythm and melody. The interludes of Bernard's guitar attacking at various part of the songs; Yup, Corners got that but its different from Bernard's straightforward guitar part, Corner's guitar interlude is where you get that surf punk/ West Coast touch and unique from New Order & Joy Division and what sets them apart as being a rip-off and as Corners. Corners even got that machine like, sharp drumming of The Human Drum Machine, Stephen Morris. Corners also got synth but as oppose as relying too much on it for the sound, it acts to complement their songs.   We're Changing    The opening on their album and starts off with a killer bass riff. I really like the lyrics on this songs as it is very relatable (and repeatable); songs is about forgetting past romance.     you know that's not the man I am   you know that's not the way I am     This verse just hits, i dont know if its just me or not, but it is very relatable as many of us had made many past mistakes that does not reflect on who we actually are. Hence ""you know that's not the man I am"" or ""the way I am."" Thus the singer, Tracy Bryant, eloquently ends it in a very anthemic shout: ""We're changing!""   Love Letters    This is the song that I think will get Corners a lot of recognition (and even they admit that). Song starts of with a robotic drumming reminiscing of Stephen Morris and dat fucking synth - very reminiscing of the synth of an 80s aerobic video; heck, with a very rhythmic bass of Peter Hook, this makes a great workout song like running or some aerobic exercise. But dat synth! You also get to hear some of that West Coastness to it with the various interludes of the guitar part. It even got the most stylish, finesse music video I ever seen (with all the smokes, sick visuals, swaying, and quick flashes of each band member's profile. In all, video is very original and unique from many music video I ve seen. You probably can't tell but video is recorded at The Smell.   The Spaceship   Starts off with a killer bass (similiar to Peter Hook's) and various interlude of a very menacing guitar part followed by dat scream (Yeaaaa!!). In this song, this is where you get to hear more of the vocals from a different band member (Jeffertitti). Whenever they scream ""In the space ship"" or ""in the basement"" it reminds me of the screams of ""Confusion!"" in New Order's Confusion or even Joy Division's Walked in Line & Ice Age; the drumming (and maybe feel) is very much like New Order's Hurt but still retain its own identity.   Pressure   In this song, this is where you get to hear more of Corner's surf-punk/ West Coast sound. Whenever I hear this song, I get this feeling that this song can be easily included into Pulp Fiction's soundtrack. At first time hearing this, you can hear that the vocals of this song is very reminiscent of Ian Curtis (and you also get that reminscent Peter Hook bass, the attacking guitar riffs of Bernard Sumner, and maybe some of the Martin Hannet's signature atmospheric feel found in Unknown Pleasures and Movement).   Buoy   This song is probably the closest to a New Order song (that bass, the drumming,atmosphere feel, and deadpan Movement era Bernard Sumner-like - or you can say Ian Curtis-like - vocals); if I blindly heard this, I could have easily mistaken it as on of New Order's unreleased material for Movement. You can also hear in the beginning that Martin Hannett's signature echo of glass cracking. In this song, this is where you here the variety of vocals the band has to offer ( plus 3 of them are vocalists in their respective solo work). Buoy sounds kind of similar to New Order's Hurt (most similar in terms of rhythm), Senses, Chosen Time, Denial, Everything Gone's Green (w/ the yelling), and maybe Mesh.   In all, I have a feeling they will be big soon. Last but not least but they will be having a homecoming show on May 14 at The Echoplex (I will be going for sure); to add to that, they are pretty good live as well (unlike New Order which I have heard is not that great live)."

Discerning the details is a great way to get people to appreciate the song and get an idea of why I like it."

postpunk,333i5t,YorjYefferson,2,Sun Apr 19 04:15:33 2015 UTC,Pop era Blancmange plus ᗅᗺᗷᗅ just has to be a huge win every time. I absolutely see this as post punk in a way I don't see Aha or Depeche Mode fitting. I loved their pop stuff ( particularly the Nononono bit from Don't Tell Me strangely) but then again I like  ᗅᗺᗷᗅ and Eurovision.  If you want to get really dirty you really need to check out their Irene & Mavis 1980 release which was quite different to following stuff. Concentration Baby is hilarious.
postpunk,333i5t,weblypistol,2,Sun Apr 19 11:42:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this was my first post here at your sub and I was worried it might be a bit too pop or new wave. I really like the song, both this one and the original. I also like how you spelled ᗅᗺᗷᗅ correctly with the backwards B :)  Blancmange is one of those groups I don't know a lot about, and most of what I do know is more from around this era. But I listened to a few of the clips from I&M that you linked, Disco a Bomb Bomb is fantastic.  *edit- I couldn't spell 'correctly' correctly, d'oh"

postpunk,32ou4j,presscolor,1 point,Thu Apr 16 07:17:27 2015 UTC,Good choices. I was going to include Hateful Abandon in there but I felt like I didn't listen to their last album as much as the other ones in the post.

postpunk,32bs6s,Idimmu_Xul,4,Sun Apr 12 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"Well what do you already enjoy listening to? That will help a lot with giving you some recommendations. Or are you just looking for general stuff to check out?  I'd recommend checking out this cool flowchart that /u/santos_malandros made. That should give you something to start with.  As far as what I'd recommend, The Idiot, Lust For Life and New Values by Iggy Pop (he's mainly associated with straight up punk, but those albums are oozing with post punk-ish sound imo), Unkown Pleasures by Joy Division, Remain In Light by Talking Heads (watch their concert in Rome too! I've posted it in here before (or at least ""Born Under Punches""), and it's a fantastic gig), Pop Crimes and Teenage Snuff Film by Rowland S Howard, Bauhaus, Entertainment by Gang Of Four, and Tender Prey + Henry's Dream by Nick Cave.  Now, to get to the last part of your post, one thing you have to remember is that post punk is a ridiculously broad genre. You have stuff like Talking Heads, Gang of Four, and some Bauhaus categorized in the same genre as Nick Cave & TBS, who are categorized in the same genre as Swans, who are categorized with Big Black (even if they're typically just labeled as noise rock) or Sonic Youth. I can't specifically speak for whether I'd lump The Smiths in with other post punk acts, since I'm not very familiar with their work (I can't stand Morrisey's voice), but I still think that what I've said about it applies.  Edit: Check out the replies to this thread that I made awhile back. Comments are a gold mine imo, so you might find some cool stuff."
postpunk,32bs6s,MaGoGo,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:06:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome reply.  I think part of the trouble i have with the genre is its broadness. I do enjoy the smiths,  i really like some swans stuff. iggy pop is pretty cool.   Joy division is kinda lacking to me. But ill probably give em another shot. Same with bauhaus.   Ill have to check out that chart later when i get home!  Some random songs (idk if they fit perfectly) i like are Carry Home by the gun club, Sunlight Bathed the golden glow by Felt, and Decry by Film Noir.   But im really open to like ant suggestions that are difinitive or just super good songs."
postpunk,32bs6s,baroqueworks,4,Sun Apr 12 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"Before you dismiss Joy Division, read about Ian Curtis and his backstory. I would also keep in mind that there were very few bands that sounded like that when they came out. Also ""Transmission"", ""Love will tear us apart"", ""Isolation"", and more are excellent songs."
postpunk,32bs6s,MaGoGo,2,Sun Apr 12 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  Yeah, it's one of the things that annoys me about post punk. I definitely wouldn't want all of the bands to sound the same, but I'd like it if they had more in common than just ""well, these are some bands that were inspired by punk rock and maybe Leonard Cohen and Bowie"". I know that's simplifying it a lot, but I think you know what I mean. :p  And I agree completely with what /u/MaGoGo said. Ian Curtis was an interesting guy with a tragic life. Definitely worth giving them a proper listen if you're interested in the genre. Like the sidebar says, they're basically the Led Zeppelin of post punk, so they're pretty important. :p  I'm not a huge fan of Gun Club, so I'm not familiar with their music either. I'll check out the other two tho.  I think I did a fairly good job of giving some definitive post punk stuff, and the chart will fill in any blanks that I've left out. Other than what I said before, maybe give Neubauten a shot. Very diverse band, and there's some stuff that definitely fits (""Dead Friends"" being a big one. I'd link, but internet is being shit).  Edit: Dunno if you're gonna be reading whole thread or not as replies come in, so check out the edit in my first post when you see this."

postpunk,2zaxxc,L3aBoB3a,0,Tue Mar 17 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"I am gonna have to disagree.  The closer you get to Ultramega Ok, the more of a bad metal bar band they sound like.  And at the very least, Down on the Upside was their most pop-metal effort."
postpunk,2zaxxc,uzmifune,0,Tue Mar 17 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"Badmotorfinger? I'd say that's their most metal album. UltramegaOK had major production issues and many prefer Screaming Life/Fopp.   DOTUS was more alternative rock with 2 or 3 pretty punky songs imo. This song came off that album because it was supposed to show all the different styles of the band through the years (they decided to disband after it was released).   I'll just take the quote right off their wiki bc it's pretty solid:  Soundgarden were pioneers of the grunge music genre, which mixed elements of punk rock and metal into a dirty, aggressive sound. ""Soundgarden are quite good…"" remarked Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, ""It's very much like the same sort of stuff that we would have done.""[102] Soundgarden's sound during the early years of the Seattle grunge scene has been described as consisting of ""gnarled neo-Zeppelinisms.""[103] The influence of Led Zeppelin was evident, with Q magazine noting that Soundgarden were ""in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo.""[104] According to Sub Pop, the band had ""a hunky lead singer and fused Led Zeppelin and the Butthole Surfers.""[105] The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence on the early work of Soundgarden.[105]  Black Sabbath also had a huge impact on the band's sound, especially on the guitar riffs[106] and tunings.[107] Joel McIver stated: ""Soundgarden are one of the bands I've heard closest to the original Sabbath sound"".[108] Soundgarden, like other early grunge bands, were also influenced by British post-punk bands such as Gang of Four and Bauhaus which were popular in the early 1980s Seattle scene.[109] Cornell himself said: ""When Soundgarden formed we were post-punk - pretty quirky. Then somehow we found this neo-Sabbath psychedelic rock that fitted well with who we were"".[110] Thayil described the band's sound as a ""Sabbath-influenced punk"".[111]  Either way, sometimes I like to post in other subs to discuss and maybe show people a song or two they might not know from a band plagued with a song like ""Black Hole Sun"" 😂"
postpunk,2zaxxc,uzmifune,0,Tue Mar 17 12:32:58 2015 UTC,What song by Soundgarden sounds like a Gang of Four song?
postpunk,2zaxxc,uzmifune,2,Wed Mar 18 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"Trying to give you the best answers here with citations. Here's a good mention from Thayil:    Paste: I have to tell you, I was into metal at the time, and you were the first Seattle band I checked out.  Thayil: Even before we slowed down and got more heavy and groove-oriented, we did stuff in weird time signatures. I don’t know how to describe it. Kinda like a Bauhaus-y-Gang of Four-Minute Men-ish-Big Boys amalgam. That was sort of before and up to Screaming Life. I mean you hear a little bit of that in “Hunted Down” or “Entering”—that sort of quirkiness or gothiness. But when we slowed down that quirkiness manifested itself in a sort of prog rock sort of quality. I remember when Badmotorfinger came out, and I remember Mark [Arm] from Mudhoney said, “Hey man, I just heard Badmotorfinger.” I’m all, “What do you think?” [Laughs] And he’s like, “Fuck, it sounds like Rush!”   I definitely hear more of the prog in their early stuff but sometimes I feel like I can't trust myself to be as objective when it comes to this band because I'm such a big fan and I've listened to their discog extensively so I may hear things differently. If that makes any sense."
postpunk,2zaxxc,LittleHelperRobot,0,Wed Mar 18 03:59:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Mark Arm's famous words to Green River about them sounding like Rush ends their postpunk aspirations.  Though, I will see if ""Hunted Down"" sounds like Gof4 or Bauhaus."

postpunk,2yahqn,paintedfaceless,1 point,Sun Mar 8 06:52:23 2015 UTC,"Vocals being ""straight up screamy hardcore"". I can concede that.  The guitars being ""very little like hardcore"". That's very suspect. One of them is using high gain and scooped mids (typically associated with metal and hardcore). The other guitarist has fuzz (once again in use of the style of metal and hardcore), their cadences are very much like a metal/hardcore song from the mid 2000s and there's even a breakdown ~2:00.  You don't even mention the bass guitar and this is kind of a big deal in the genre of post punk when it is a part of the band. In this song, it's just playing nearly same thing as the guitars and mixed fairly low. He does a feedback thing and that's about as exciting as it got for him.  So, what about this song makes it ""razor-sharp, precision post punk""?  I just don't hear it."

They're the epitome of pop-music in all its ridiculous-spastic-plastic-fake-over-the-top-stupidity with its thumb firmly on the pulse of the 80s - and that pulse goes on and on throughout every song. Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh - wailing over-the-top guitar.   If you don't like this then you don't 'get it'.  A lot of their songs are ripped off / covers of 'Suicide' songs.

postpunk,2tu34j,SkyPilotOne,2,Wed Jan 28 08:34:48 2015 UTC,"It's exactly why it is not defined in the sidebar. On a purist level it only represents Siouxsie because the term was coined in relation to them lot. Some want it to be extended from that to be only goth. Others synth or more thoughtful punk. To me it is just so much wider, but that is only my perspective. You should have seen the stink when I first started posting here and put forward a Camera Obscura tune (and I still stand by it)."

The Rapture, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand feed the nostalgia, but they just aren't the masters of sound like the early Gang.  Today they Go4 are a pale shadow of themselves, although Content was predictable but not too bad TBH."
