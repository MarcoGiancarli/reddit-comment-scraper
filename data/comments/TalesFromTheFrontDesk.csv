First, construct some cross memorials and flower tributes such as the ones seen at the side of the road  where accidents occur.  Second, place them by the tennis court, pool area, whatever you need to sway people from doing for their own good.  Third, when anyone asks what the memorials are for you say, ""I'm sure you'll be fine. These unfortunate souls were doing X (where x = the unsafe activity the guests are engaged in).""

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3e4gun,proximacentauri77,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"The only time I've ever seen anyone charged an early check-in fee is when they called the day before and wanted a guaranteed early check-in.   Otherwise, yeah. If it's 7am and you come to check in and we have the room ready, no problem."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3e4gun,AngusPodgorny,2,Tue Jul 21 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"Franchised.  I don't let anyone check in, regardless of what I have available, before 8am. As far as they're concerned, I was completely sold out.  If they want an early check in before then, they'd best book the night before as well. Especially if the motherfuckers are going to eat breakfast twice on a 1 night stay."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3e4gun,sweatpantswarrior,2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"The only time I ever charged was if it somehow cost us extra. Like if we had to have a housekeeper come in early or stay late.   Since that almost never happened, as long asit was after night audit, it was an early check in."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3e4gun,femme_hospitalitae,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:29 2015 UTC,"If we have a room available, there's no fee to check in as early as 8 AM. Earlier than that, it's up to the discretion of the night auditor on duty whether or not to let them in, but there's still no fee.  Of course, if they want to guarantee an early check in, the only way to be sure is book the night before."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3e4gun,SketchyConcierge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:07 2015 UTC,It is based on availability and the consent of the local property. At early am hours (midnight to 4) I will tell guests about how we are actually still in the previous business day and inform them of the  whole early check in general policy:  The only way to be certain of early check in is to buy the day ahead of time at whatever the rate is (As the hotel does not only clean the parts of the room used you may not pay only for the hours present).  If we are more in the 6 am or later area I'll explain that no early check in can be promised and that it is based on availability. Promises are never made and I will suggest that the guest call the FD and inform them of the expected arrival ahead of time.  If the person still tries to show up at 3 am and ask for early check in the hotel has full authority to enact whatever its' policy is on the matter. When that happens I don't feel bad if someone can't get in because I informed them of what would happen and tried my best to get them to purchase the day ahead of time or communicate their wants to the hotel ahead of showing up in the lobby.

If you are in the U.S. I believe it is federal law (which overrides state laws to the contrary or not included in state statute) that an employer CANNOT schedule you for more than 6 days of work, the 7th day it is illegal to schedule you. There should be a similar law if you are not in the U.S.  Call your labor board to file a complaint. If you don't want to do that, print up the statute and present it to your employer, you can do it anonymously if you don't feel comfortable doing it in person. If they schedule you for 7 or more days, don't show on day 7. Keep copies of all your schedules for when you file a complaint."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dxucd,Silverlight42,15,Mon Jul 20 13:47:31 2015 UTC,"Before she could find her rental keys and figure out how to get from her room to the car, the police were waiting.

Technically if the keys aren't in the ignition it becomes a game of the cop proving you had intent to drive, but in practice the jury/judge pretty much always believe the cop anyway.  If you find yourself in the position of sleeping it off in the car, leave the keys somewhere a cop can't find them. Plus, it'll prevent you from driving off before you're sober enough to remember where you put them."

I wasn't about to move her car either."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dxucd,dragonet2,7,Mon Jul 20 14:16:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to other contributions, the officers can do a blood or breath test to determine your BAC. If you refuse a blood or breath test, they can get a warrant enabling them to draw and test your blood. If your BAC when you are arrested is, say, .16 and the legal limit is .08, it is reasonable to say that within a 30 minute time frame your body is unable to process the amount of drinks/alcohol it would take for you to double up from the legal limit therefore lending probable cause to the scenario that you were, in fact, intoxicated whenever you initially left for your destination.  Fun fact: your BAC continues to rise even after you have stopped drinking because (rule of thumb- gender differences, tolerance and body weight all effect this) your body only processes 1 serving of alcohol per hour. 1 serving is defined as (1) 5oz glass of wine, (1) 12oz beer or (1) 1.5oz shot. If you were to drink 3 drinks in 1 hour, your BAC level will steadily rise over the next 3 hours.   source: i had to attend dwi classes edit: words"

For example, if someone else other than a cop catches you driving drunk, and calls the police, the police will either try and find you or send someone to your house in case that's where you're trying to go. If they get there before you do or as you do, they still have reasonable suspicion that you had to drive your car to get where you and the car are, so you were still drunk at that point."

We don't have guest-access computers, we can't take USBs to our own computers, but we can take emails and print from those.  Most people want plane tickets or events details or small things printed, nothing too exciting.  We should charge for it, but I never do because we waste so much paper ourselves, who cares about 3 pieces of paper for a guest?  This guy asked me if we provide printing, I said yes.  He emailed the document over.  It was 24 pages, he wanted 11 copies, in colour.  I tried my best, must have spent about 4 hours doing it.  The printer broke halfway through.  The guy threw a tantrum, because alongside the non-printing issues, the document also re-arranged on my computer because he was using a newer version of Microsoft PowerPoint than we had.  So it cut off the entire first letter of the company on every sheet.  I felt so bad because it was for a very high-brow job interview.  He was livid, and my dm had to shout him down because he was so aggressive about it.  I checked him out the next day, and was able to explain that I hadn't made it clear that what I was doing was a favour, not a service we provide.  We have 1 colour printer which is temperamental at best (it actually broke for good not long after this thinking about it now) and I techinically should have charged him but I didn't.  Now when people say can we print, I ask how many pages and if it's okay in black and white.  If it's more than say, 20 pages, I refuse, or if it has to be in colour, I send them to the library."

Apparently, they wanted the breakfast the same day as the dinner, just didnt think to add any dates in the emails they sent and since they went dinner, dinner, breakfast in the email, I was led to believe the special breakfast was for their final morning on property.

The other .3% of the time it's an upper teir/professional world traveler that has a FIT about it. Screaming, cursing whining. That whole thing. As they're handing me a black Amex...   I've asked friends and family if they knew that hotels take inc holds. None of them but my mom and one aunt did. So I always try to keep that in mind when dealing with people upset about the hold.

It could be considered hotel jargon and not recognised by the occasional traveler?  Consider revising your wording to something like, ""we'll need to place a hold on your card to cover any possible charges to your room.""  Also, some businesses will do a credit card pre-authorisation for a small amount like $1, just to verify the card is good, but this reduces the impact to the customer if they're using a debit card.   I don't know if this is an option - it probably depends on the type of demographic you tend to get at your property."

Anyway, my favorite of all time came from my time at an ""Economical Lodge"", so to speak. I was on night audit, and it was a pretty average night so far. I got a call from the room, it was some drunk-sounding chick who wanted extra towels. Now I'm thinking ""Great, she puked on the floor. My favorite."" But I get the towels, put up my ""Back in 5!"" sign, and roll out.  The door opens and out tumble these two goth-looking girls, and calling them 18 is a generosity I extend only to protect myself. They are scantily-clad and, most importantly, handcuffed at the wrists and ankles each. ""Hi,"" one warbled at me, ""we're stuck.""  At this point I am already fed up with this, and when they ask if I can help them I can only tell them I can help them break the cuffs, but we don't really keep lock picking tools behind the desk. She goes ""That's ok, we'll just wait for Filbert to come back."" So I set the towels down, they scooch back into the room, and I shut that door and scuttle off straight away.  A bit later, in comes Filbert. Not Philbert, Filbert. Only way I can describe this guy is he looks like a guy that ate Fat Albert whole and finished with a milkshake. Don't think he was just fat - he was- he was tall. This guy was huge. He had a McDonald's bag in each hand and was hands down the scariest-looking motherfucker I had seen til then or since. He looks at me and goes ""Sup? My girls give you any trouble?""  I had a little warning since I looked up his photo ID, but sweet shit this man was large. I got out ""Uh... I think they're stuck. In handcuffs."" Filbert just rolls his eyes like it's nothing and lumbers off.  Now, I don't know what happened after that. I didn't leave the desk again that night, but all I know was that the next day, housekeeping found an array of BDSM gear that would make Christian Grey seek Jesus. The girls were gone, and only Filbert stayed the next night."

One time I kicked out a prostitute that had her room paid for by someone that was on our DNR list. She threw a giant Sonic cup filled with her slushie against the lobby wall and left. One time I kicked a prostitute out because she had too many people kum and go. I refused to refund her and she decided to hold the front desk monitor hostage. We fought over it and I called the cops. There were some other guests that were screaming WORLD STAR!!! as they filmed us. Don't know what happened to that video.  The johns coming to see these girls are the MOST OBVIOUS. I mean, no eye contact and walks straight to the elevator or down the hallway. 30 minutes later they leave passing the front desk...

No biggie really, since it was a man & woman checking in, I assumed they were brother & sister and wanted to be able to move freely between each others rooms.   A day or two later, I get called into the GM's office and questioned about the people that checked into these rooms. No prior phone calls had been made to me bout them, nothing unusual about the check in, how they were acting, etc. Then I get shown the camera footage of the hallway outside their room.  Turns out, they were police officers, the men changed into uniform in one room, used the undercover female to bait men and were waiting in the adjacent room until the ""deal"" had been made. Then they arrested them! There were at least 3 guys arrested that I was shown.  Luckily it all happened after I left, but seriously, wow! And not letting the hotel know what they were trying / going to do! And get this:no guests complaints about commotion, people being arrested and escorted out nothing!

I call up, say that there is a Sarah here to meet him, I am told to send her up, and point her in the right direction.  Turns out the room she was sent to was the groom in a bachelor party, and either they hired her as a joke, completely understanding what they were ordering, or messed up hiring a hooker via craig's list. Too this day I have never decided. Well Lisa goes up to the room, finds the door open, and makes herself comfortable awaiting the guests return.  This lead to a very interesting call with corporate, with the guests claiming they just got back to the rooms, but we had proof they were lying and told them to go back to their rooms and stay put. I assume it was the best man who hired her, as he was the biggest douche. Once we pointed out to the groom we knew it was one of his friends that hired her, he shut up and went away.  Best part is, an hour after all of this settle down, the best man called down asking if we could hire him a hooker."

First, that Priceline and other third party reservation systems take out a huge commission on the rooms, so you ask for $150, he gets it for $125, but the hotel only receives  $100. If you match the rate he was offered, you'll gain $25...  The other thing they know is that these sites are notorious for screwing up reservations.  So, they offer to book directly if you match the rate, and supposedly everyone wins.  As for asking if you have rooms available, they just want you to confirm that there is a room, and that the price they are seeing is better than what was offered. If you and the TPS are the same price, he'll just book with you directly since there is no price matching involved."

It's like they think if they play this game we will quite a lower rate. NO. STOP. This isn't going to happen because I'm here to UPSELL THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. (and I'm damn good at it, all you gotta do is quote a high room you know they don't want and then give a lower room. if they didn't look online youre usually good to book).  Bonus: Asking the total w/ tax and refusing to give me your name means im going to avoid doing anything to help you for the rest of the call and basically be a big pain in your ass til you hang up on me, because you werent going to book anyways and would hang up as soon as you had the # you called for.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dqney,cassandraterra,11,Sat Jul 18 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"I am surprised that your property information shows maximum occupancy five people. The general rule is two people per bed or sleeper sofa unless it is only a twin size bed (more common in B&Bs).  There is absolutely no rule that you have to have the max occupancy set at what fire standards allow, you can set it lower if you want.    People just assume that if it says five max there are sleeping accommodations for five adults. And by having it show five, people might try to cram one more adult in. Of course you would allow more than four if they have small children, you can easily fit three small children on a foldout sofa. Most family travelers are going to ignore the max occupancy info anyways if they are traveling with young children.  By reducing the max occupancy to 4 in a two bedroom it will be easier to turn away or evict party rooms, slumber parties or just really cheap guests who should've gotten two rooms but try to cram everyone into one.   I would only keep it at five if your property is capable and willing to provide a rollaway bed at no charge anytime someone wants to accommodate five. That could be disastrous however if a team books rooms and expects to get five players in each room.  I would talk to your GM about possibly changing the property information in their system to two people per bed (or sofa) in a room. This is pretty typical and can prevent problems in the future."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dog2c,Ewli,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:08 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, I almost never have a problem when the guest pays Expedia and we collect from Expedia's virtual card. The problem is Expedia now offers an option when you book. It'll say ""Pay Not"" or ""Pay Later"". The pay later option is where all the problems come from... No contact info, more than half the cards decline...."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dog2c,ICant-_-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"Pssh, expedia doesn't care about giving guests more options. They now offer guest pay because they got in trouble for only paying taxes on the money they take for commission rather than the whole amount the guest was paying them. The way their prepaid system works is the guest pays expedia, and expedia then turns around and pays the hotel. F*ck you expedia!"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dog2c,Malephus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"This Expedia Collect, is it the prepaid stuff? Beginning 7/1/15 Expedia now pays city/county/state taxes on their prepaid reservations instead of leaving it to the hotel. At my property if we don't change the reservation to tax exempt and we try to run the card then it declines.   If it's Hotel Collect from the Guest then your guess is as good as mine. Whenever we talk one of these tacotwat third parties about a lack of contact info there is always some sort of spiel about guest privacy. They just don't want us to be able to contact the guest to fix any problems directly IMO."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dop3w,storysunfolding,7,Sat Jul 18 04:52:39 2015 UTC,But they are entitled to it. It's a benefit of that tier and they forked over enough money to your brand to earn it.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dop3w,danatblair,2,Sat Jul 18 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that they are entitled to the perk. I actually use it as a selling point when talking to business travelers who are interested in a membership.   However, there are blackout dates and there are a set number of hours required for advanced notice, the number of rooms may be limited, override days may not use points or other redemption, and it may only be available for the actual top tier guest directly and not friends or family sans reward member. I will happily book anyone with an override, provided the rules are met and the system lets me.   I have had top tiers have to compromise a little. For instance if they wanted today until a set day, I booked at the hotel they wanted as soon as I could get the override to work and at a nearby property for the first day or two."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3doj4w,Luvodicus,4,Sun Jul 19 06:50:32 2015 UTC,"What would work for my property: Call [maybe a week or two] before hand and ask to request an upgrade to a remodeled suite if one is available. They will likely make a note in the reservation, and keep it in mind when they assign rooms.  Try to arrive early/close to check-in time, when there are more available rooms to choose from. When you check in, ask if they were able to fulfill the request for a remodeled suite, and offer a tip (~$20) in hopes that they can make it happen for you. Also, Front Desk Agents like food - we stand up a lot and don't always have time to eat. If you come in with cookies or a pizza...you'd get whatever you want from me.   There are a lot of factors, but a tip to the Front Desk always helps.   Even if you do end up in a non-remodeled room, they will probably still take really good care of you during your stay. A few weeks ago I had a guy call to ask for an upgrade, but I wasn't able to do it. He was really nice about it and asked if there was anything I could do to make the stay special - he travels a lot for business, but was on a leisure trip with his wife who doesn't normally travel. He wanted to impress her. I totally felt for the guy, and I was able to get him a room with a view, and I threw together a nice goody bag with some candy and stuff, and even managed to talk the sales department out of a bottle of champagne."

So its a Friday night and we have a couple of wedding parties staying with us at the hotel.   Its roughly 9 oclock at night and one of the earlier weddings gets back from the reception. People are drunk, but nothing too crazy or out of the ordinary for me. Until a man in about his mid 40s walks into the lobby and sits down in one of the chairs. He was very obviously hammered, but I thought nothing of it.  He gets up and disappears down the hallway (In the direction of the bathroom) and is gone for about 5-10 mins. He then returns to the lobby and passes out in the same chair he was sitting in before. Not even a second later a guest comes up to me and alerts me that the entire bathroom was covered in vomit.   I send the houseman in and he walked out as quick as he walked in and almost vomitted himself. Basically he says he is not going to clean this mess up (Not the best employee, did not last too long).   Me being 18 at the time, start to get selected to be the one to go and start cleaning this up. (Non-union hotel so this isn't an issue legally) I walk in and its horrible, He got the sink, trailed over to the urinal, and then made his way into the stall but most of it was out.   The smell was terrible, and I had to scoop vomit out of the lobby sink (He had the salad that night) and into the toilet just to get rid of it. After getting rid of most of it the houseman decides to do his job again and help clean/freshen up the room.   10 mins after all of this is done, a 70-80 year old woman approaches me and sincerely apologizes for her sons actions. This made it a little better, but still haha."

Before 6:30 or so, when it's light traffic, nobody minds if the kitchen or engineering or the auditor/AM shift grabs a plate and takes it offstage. Leftovers generally get put in the breakroom for HK. Now if we had staff coming to eat at like 9am when it's slammed, we'd have a problem, but luckily everyone is pretty common sense about it."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dew6y,Cosmoviking,3,Thu Jul 16 09:50:19 2015 UTC,"We have a free breakfast and are allowed to eat. Only after breakfast times though.

That said, as a night audit I can go and eat from the breakfast buffet as long as I'm off duty and in normal clothes. I just don't make a habit out of it, because I don't really think it's appropriate and I hate being served by my coworkers just feels really awkward."

Our name tags also have the brand symbol and a thing/place/topic that we can discuss at length. Most employees have some thing sport, food, or animal related. I have a historical site on my name tag - in the two years I've been with the hotel exactly three people have cared to ask about it.   I saw on here (maybe a year ago) a person who was part of the same brand I am - his name tag connection was listed as Kakariko Village from the Zelda games. Apparently he convinced his HR department it was a town he grew up in. It made me realize I missed so many opportunities to have a little fun on my name tag."

I met her the first time she visited the resort and she took such a liking to me (admittedly I am pretty awesome) that she asked for a hug. ...and for my personal phone number and email address. She got none of the above, but stupidly I offered a high five.    She will call sometimes and refuses to speak to anyone else. But she asks me things like where in my state I think she should live. And that she wants to work with me. ...where do I think would be a good fit for her at hotel. She has never stayed over in hotel before but she will drive over to say hello.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3ddvsz,kiraella,5,Wed Jul 15 19:27:00 2015 UTC,exactly so. I usually only give them my initials.

We have our first names on our badges if we're bottom rung, then supervisors etc have surnames and positions on their name badge. But our email addresses are our full names. Luckily I use a nickname on all social media so if you search for me by my given name on google, some Austrailian MP comes up. But for anyone else, if they give their email out, immediately we are giving guests all the information they need to track us down on social media - and we all know how careful some people are with social media. We give out our email addresses probably 20 to 30 times a day in several different procedures."

Who cares if we are understaffed. Let's take upper management away from normal duties so they can walk around property checking for nametags.  Yup sounds good.   That was a rant.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3denos,rosas_lunch,8,Wed Jul 15 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that hotels have to pay a commission to the booking agency OR the booking agency will charge you for the commission. If they take the commission from the hotel, the hotel rate will be higher. If they take the commission from you, the hotel rate will be lower BUT you have to pay commission. NONE of this will be shown on your bill with the booking agency. They will just give you a price per room and not explain how that breaks down.   Short answer. Book yourself. Call the hotel directly and say that you are looking to make a group block. Go over the details such as: individual call in or rooming list and one payment, cutoff date to make reservations if its a individual call in block, secure the rate, secure the number of rooms, secure the type of rooms, make sure the rate is the final charge (meaning no other charges for another person), Make sure to get all of this in the group contract.   It's honestly a very easy process. I recommend doing individual call in. The hotel will put a cut off date for reservations. After the cutoff date, any rooms not utilized will be released. Meaning, you are not responsible for anything else and all the reservations have each guests CC on file."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3denos,trailless,4,Wed Jul 15 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"I hesitate to click the links because I'm at work. But, if it's a service that literally blocks the rooms for you I say no. You could do it yourself and save the money. I'd definitely do it yourself. Plus miscommunication could happen since there's a middleman and they might have to consult with you about every little thing. Idk just my 2 cents."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3denos,FrontDeskNewbie,5,Wed Jul 15 18:43:09 2015 UTC,"I have seen some events that only go through rooming services. I'd also advise that if there is a problem you can't go to the hotel, you have to go through the rooming service.   Personally, I'd do a websearch first and get a general idea of places to look Then I'd take a few days and visit the properties (instead of relying on some other companies promises of what it looks like)  and then talk to the in-house sales groups.   And for the record, I am doing this for my own wedding. I personally feel better seeing the site before I negotiate anything. I don't want to go through a third party site because I know that if there is a complication I want to be able t ask the hotel to help me directly.   go into it with a list of questions: is there a resort fee? If so what does it cover? What would it cost to include breakfast in the rate? What if there was a meal on one of the evenings? How many people fit in the venue?  And for the record, I honestly believe that the hotel block group you linked is fine.. I just don't know that I would go that route myself or advise anyone to do the same.  I deal in reservations and ever so often I get a guest who needs help changing a room or getting added to the block and my hand are fully tied because the person needs to go through the rooming group. More often than not the person doesn't even know there is a rooming group and they don't understand why I can't help them right there. It's because the rooming group owns the rooms and reservations at that point. I cannot change things for them. They are the ones that have to oversee it, but telling a person who is frustrated and anxious that the bureaucrat is on another phone line  seldom goes over well."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3denos,danatblair,4,Wed Jul 15 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"I have seen some events that only go through rooming services. I'd also advise that if there is a problem you can't go to the hotel, you have to go through the rooming service.    And I will tell you as a guest I hate rooming services (or at least the one that my industry's annual convention uses) -- they add a layer if obfuscation, increase my costs (If they weren't making money they wouldn't be in business), don't add any value whatsoever, and manage to screw up my reservation in the same ways every year [e.g. I have my rewards program number in the initial reservation. I email them to confirm that my rewards program number will be in the hotel reservation. They say yes, of course. Then I get the actual hotel confirmation and not only is it missing but the single King I booked has suddenly turned into a double (that's a battle not worth fighting)) .  I know it's not the property screwing it up because it goes down in exactly the same way every year -- doesn't matter which city, state, or sub-brand. I hate them and wish the properties would let me book direct. I'd even pay slightly more to avoid the headache.  (Sorry, I really needed to let that rant go)"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3denos,lincolnjkc,2,Wed Jul 15 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, thank you for your perspective. I am always frustrated by them because I usually can't fix the simple issues I see (when those stupid reservations even show up in my system). I could literally fix both problems you mentioned (or give you a heads up that I cannot guarantee bed type) within a minute or two. Adding a loyalty number and checking bed type are so simple and I have to tell the person coming to me that they need to track down whoever is in charge of their group and ask them to look into it.  It's nice to know they are annoying all around."

Things like complaints that our elevator was dirty and not functioning properly, and was a serious safety hazard.   We do not have elevators at our hotel.

When we explained this to her she said she would just book another night using points.  The reservation pops up, I do the check her out and check her back in deal.  At 7:30, I get a call from her saying she has left and just wanted to let us know.  I informed her that would likely be charged for the room anyway.  This did not make her happy, she got very upset and rude with me.  I got a call from corporate a little after that and I when I explained my side of the story he told me she had told him a completely different story.  He believed me and informed her that the charge was justified.  She called one more time to tell me how ""ridiculous"" this was (I couldn't help but agree) and to be rude some more.

It's their culture that they just don't understand sometimes, not their language. A lot of Asians will just cut all of the lines, something they're used to, not necessarily being rude on purpose.   As far as Jeremy is concerned, you probably shouldn't have said that and gotten two guests intertwined like that. But at that point, if Jeremy mentions a lawsuit, just simply say ""I'm sorry but because you mentioned you will be taking legal action, I cannot continue to hold this conversation."" Shut them off. That way if they really want to sue, they have no grounds to stand on or complain about. Otherwise they'll shut up and you just check them in or walk them."

My hotel's policy is that if anyone threatens legal action, we're to direct them to human resources (who takes their complaint and directs them to our legal department if necessary) and inform them that we have to terminate the conversation and stop speaking with them. And it may be bad of me, but it's my favorite thing when I get to do that. I was trying to help you, but now you screwed up and said the wrong thing and fucked yourself over. I would've told Howard, ""I'm sorry for bothering you, sir. You're welcome to go back to your room and enjoy the rest of your evening,"" before turning to Jeremy with ""I'm sorry, sir, but because you've threatened legal action company policy dictates I terminate this conversation and refer you to our human resources department.

If you aren't checked in yet, I don't care if you're the President, I won't prefer you over someone already in-house.   I had something similar happen last week when our highest tier member was able to force sell a room and we went negative. I had to walk the last guest and he threatened to do a chargeback for the stay. Now, normally we pay for his room and they don't owe a cent. However, as he booked through a 3rd party, I couldn't even see his CC info. I told him that he'd have to take it up with whatever company booked it.   He wasn't happy."

They've always thrown me under the bus, and they always punished me for ""causing them problems""(by cutting my hours, permanently or temporarily, even if in the end they've faced no real problems).   So the best thing I can do is either help these people out, despite the fact that they threatened me/the company I work for, and unfortunately because there was a lot of yelling, the only thing I could do to deal with the situation was to tell Howard to go to his room. Looking back I could have tried to be nicer, but given the circumstances, I'm not sure being nice would have gotten through, just been drowned out by the yelling, threatening, and general chaotic nature of the area."

Sure, it sucked and we didn't have a room to move him to, but you can't remove, destroy or disable an alarm. So not only was he charged damage fees by me, but I called the fire marshal on him and he was fined and charged by the marshal.   He then tried writing to corporate about how I unfairly called the law on him. I called corporate with video showing him stealing our pool equipment as well as his admittance he removed the detector, as our desk cameras have audio too.   Needless to say he is blacklisted and out of a lot of money."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dd6cu,FLDJF713,3,Wed Jul 15 11:24:47 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a b&b for a legitimately unstable woman, and one morning a fire alarm went off in a guest room for no reason at 4:30am.  Her explanation was the house is haunted.  The guests thought she was being cute but she was dead serious and from that day on would tell incoming guests about her ""ghost.""  Also, not fire alarms, but our hotel has CO2 detectors in the room with a tiny green light.  We had so many people call down to complain about the light our first week open that we eventually had a houseman go around the hotel and cover every single one of them."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dd6cu,homewoodsweetie,2,Wed Jul 15 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"When my hotel was renovated they also ""upgraded"" the fire alarm system. For the first month anytime any sensor tripped it would automatically call the Fire Dept. This meant that if someone burnt popcorn or food that they would get a call saying the room was on fire. After being fined by them my boss finally called the alarm company to come fix it. It still took another week after calling before someone came out and reprogrammed it so the company was alerted and not the local fire depo. As a Night Auditor I had the extreme fun job of always going up to the room every time it went off to reset the alarms and sensors. So many nice people to greet me in the wee hours of the morning."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3dd6cu,Wingsofra,2,Wed Jul 15 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"This happens to us often, only because during the summer, the heat never gets used and the dust settles on the coils.  When the heat is turned on/up for the first time in a while, the dust burns, giving this burning smell in the room and triggers the alarm in the guest rooms.   When people call freaking out I tell them it'll stop in a couple seconds, and it will not do that again, then explain to them what happened."

One winter morning the valet was not as his post for whatever reason, but the driver left the engine running as they delivered luggage to the front desk.  Of course the car was gone when they got back.  We pulled the security tape, and all we saw was some black blob come running up to the car and peel out as soon as the driver was out of sight.  The police make their report, he driver submits it to the airport and his insurance company.  But you know how when you insure your car they usually ask you something about using it for commercial purposes? Since it was the driver's personal vehicle, insurance wouldn't cover his delivery service.  Luckily the car was located a few days later.

The NAs I have are really good but even they're getting sick of what the day/evening shifts are doing. I've watered down training guides, made training guides for things that shouldn't even need a guide, made myself available for questions/help when I'm not on the property, and no improvement's being shown.   Your day auditor sounds like he's looking for problems (and it seems that there are some but the response is disproportional to the problem), so the best advice I can recommend from someone in a similar position would be:  -Carry a small notebook (3x5 or so) that you can have in your pocket that has notes or procedures written down (You said he commented on you making a certain type of mistake) so you have a step-by-step for it.  -I'm big on open communication, but it seems like putting a target on your forehead if you ask him for help; maybe speak to coworkers for help?   -I admit I will speak to people over little mistakes, because with my group, there's a 99% chance it will turn into a bigger mistake.   -Keep your chin up and focus on the work and not the comments about your work.

If you are willingly working the audit shift, they should be kissing your ass.  A good auditor is hard to find and keep.   Try not to get on any meds.  They can cause more problems then they solve.     This shift can also lead to social isolation.  Make time to see loved ones.  This sub is also good because you are with friends.  Ignore the trolls.

I'm a Night Auditor at a hotel located in Central Florida, almost exactly equidistant from Universal and Disney. It's a weekend in JULY (read: peak season) and this woman walks in without a reservation and wants a suite. No problem; rack rate is $155, but I quote her $129. She starts asking for discounts, I tell her it's already discounted. Then she goes off on how it's 11:15pm, and she shouldn't have to pay for a full night because it's so late (sorry; that's not how it works).  She finally agrees, but almost balks when I ask her to sign the registration card -- she doesn't like the standard fine print about how she would be held responsible for stolen or damaged items in the room, and thinks we're going to charge her arbitrarily. I tell her that's not how we do business, but her signature is required if she wants the room. She agrees, but demands a copy of the registration card. Fine, whatever, I make her a copy, hand her the keys, and off she goes.  I don't hear a peep from her all night.  The next morning, my first shift team member comes in, and as I'm leaving, I tell him about the guest, and warn him that I'm pretty sure she's going to give him a hard time at Checkout. Sure enough, when she came down she immediately went off on how I overcharged her and she wanted a discount. When he refused to budge, she began complaining about everything in the rooms from the beds being uncomfortable to the cabinets being out of date. He refused to budge but gave her a complimentary late check-out so at least she'd think she was getting some sort of perk.  You have to wonder how these folks function at other businesses."

Meaning, the hotel pays different credit card rates when you swipe a cc or not. Hypothetically, if you did check her in without swiping the card, she could dispute the charge with her CC company and say that she never stayed there. Then when the person who is in charge of researching the chargeback, would discovered that you never swiped the card, it wouldn't be a good thing.  Long story short, you did good by following policy and procedure, and letting the buck stop with you. You handled the situation superbly without having management stepping in."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d0ls0,lukevan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:45:37 2015 UTC,I would assume credit card on file.  I'm curious about the comments where FD is saying those cards are declined.  It's my understanding that a test charge is made to the card when the reservation is made and another charge is made if that's the card the guest says they want to use at check-in.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d0ls0,awhq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:11 2015 UTC,"Hence, if a credit card is on file, they don't need to officially check out, like I've said.  Front Desk always runs an authorization of the card at check-in (for the total amount with tax, and depending on the hotel, a bit more for incidentals, unless someone screwed up).    Guest can still pay by cash, check or with a separate card at check-out if they wish and the original card will not be charged.  But the hotel has the pending authorization to fall back on if the guest leaves without checking out."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d09ny,MaxNV,4,Sun Jul 12 12:06:56 2015 UTC,"I only have 15 check ins today, but it has since risen to 19.  Lot of phone calls and zero engineers on duty.. Yay.   Also, people trying to check in way before check-in time and expecting a room, suck.  Yes, you called a few days ago to ask, but it's never guaranteed!  At least call me before you drive over to double check."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d09ny,tongue_tiedx,6,Sun Jul 12 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"Oh my God I have those as I speak. I'm sick of early check-ins. However I try to use it to my advantage : I tell them the only way they can get a free early check in is if they sign up for the rewards program. I get points when I sign someone up.   But I hate when people try to pull it on days like today when we were sold out last night. What's even worse is when they have the NERVE to ask for a special request! It's like ""Dude you're lucky I pulled enough strings to get you a room period at 11 am. And now you think I can just magically pull a 2nd floor corner room away from the pool out of nowhere?"" Some people are seriously clueless."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d09ny,tongue_tiedx,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"That's my identical situation. Sold out or not, our property is so small that only one person works the desk at a time. Even as an office manager I still have to do all of my work while doing a desk shift. So if anyone ever calls out the person before them normally works a double. It's normally not bad- I do well in limited services settings. But days like today are the true definition of limited service hell."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3d09ny,playing_the_angel,3,Sun Jul 12 19:09:34 2015 UTC,I was booking a guest into a hotel room and I flatout explained to him that the hotel was sold out the night before and that while I could technically request an early check-in that the odds were very low based on the hotels actual availability. He then started talking down to me like an idiot and said he was going to call the hotel direct (the number that sent him to the reservation center in the first place.) I just sorta mentally shrugged and let him do that. Odds are he'd just get another call center person or that the hotel would deny the request.

Some folks will ignore you and walk on by but most are cool people on some level and you can have some fun conversations.  Good posture and make eye contact.  Laugh when they try to be funny.  Be willing to do a little extra for people, it will improve a guest's impression of you and they'll treat you with respect.  I really try to stay focused on what's going on in the hotel and not dwell on anything going on at home, good or bad.    I was an introvert before I entered the hospitality industry but really have become an extrovert through my experiences."

Especially since I'm here! :D I sing at my staff and occasionally dance at them, too. Note: at was intentional. I do not dance with people. I dance at them. It's an attack mode. I greet passing guests and ask them how their room is/stay has been and if I can get anything for them.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3czkt8,Jszanko,10,Sun Jul 12 06:36:34 2015 UTC,We have very strict rules that are rigorously enforced for sports teams we host at my property. Each room that checks in under the block reviews and signs these rules and receives a copy. Some of them are:  -Quiet hours are from 10pm-8am. You get ONE warning for noise complaints before we boot you sans refund.  -All minors must be accompanied by an adult when in the common areas of the hotel.  -Alcoholic beverages are not allowed anywhere except your room or the restaurant/bar.  -Any refunds issued for noise complaints originating from ANY room in your block will have the cost spread across all rooms on the block.   These are just a few of the major points and it has done a GREAT job for both the problems caused by these types of groups and for having to issue refunds due to those problems. Might be a good thing to bring up to your management.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3czkt8,chupacuntbra,5,Sun Jul 12 11:18:52 2015 UTC,I would like to applaud whoever puts your group contracts together

I probably would have told them ""I'm glad you all think this is so funny. I'm sure it's going to be just as funny in half an hour when you're all looking for a new hotel to stay in. You have two options right now: either you all go to your rooms and stay there for the night, or every single one of you can go gather your things and leave without a refund. If neither of those options appeal to you, I'm sure the police will help you pick one.""  Honestly, I am soooooooooo glad that our hotel is no longer taking sports teams after our remodel/chain switch. We're upgrading into a higher class of hotel and will no longer take dogs either (less hyped about this, we were the only ones in town who accepted dogs and a lot of people loved us for it) but the fact that I won't have to yell at a room full of drunken parents while their 8-12 year old hockey playing boys are rampaging through the building is just going to be so nice."

I recently took a GM position with the promise of being a Regional Manager for multiple hotels in the near future. I know that I'm not going to wait around for 7 years waiting for a Regional Manager position, I'll give it year. Once, shame on you. Twice, shame on me, right?   Anyways, my advice?

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3czo8t,TrollingPerv,3,Sun Jul 12 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"This sound exactly like what happened to me when I worked as a GSR, with aspirations of being a GM. The GM and AGM I worked for promised to eventually start training me as an manager, but would just keep stringing me along. Every couple of months I would ask them what the progress was, and they would just give me the standard ""Just be patient, these things take time"" answer.  After 2+ years of this, the final straw was when I asked the GM if she had submitted the required paperwork to corporate for the 3rd time (which she said she would do months ago), and she said ""Oh, I totally forgot again!"" and burst out laughing, like she had made a whimsical faux pas or something.  I quit soon after and took another front desk job at a private company that paid almost double what I was making. As luck would have it, the GM there quit 3 months after I started, and they promoted me to the exact position I was training for in the previous job.  Everything has worked out really well, and as a manager I find myself more than happy to bend over backwards so that my employees don't ever have to go through any of the BS that I suffered when I worked for corporate."

Housekeeping comes in the next morning only to see the room is absolutely damaged and completely WRECKED.  Guests peaced out already.   CC on filed used to make a reservation was a complete dummy.

After joining a chugging chorus to the memory of Flattus in the beer garden to the background noise of an empty venue performance of Every Time I Die, walking into a hall with the lights turned out, a single spotlight on the armor and mask of Flattus entombed, the venue dead silent, all in attendance paying respect to a fallen friend.  It was like that for nearly 20 minutes, near the end the crowd slowly drew into a chant of Flattus Maximus, as we did in the beer pit.  That night, all of the band had moments, beyond the mask, just being human, remembering Cory, it was one hell of a night, and the only time I didn't get to sneak in and party with the band after the show.

F-keys and tab get some play, but that's about it. Point-and-click all the way. Everything's color coded- pretty idiot proof- but some of the features are not well integrated, I think.    EDIT: If you're required to run on satellite internet, acquaint yourself with the disconnected state. Overcast? Disconnected. Rain 3 miles away? Disconnected. Slight breeze? Disconnected. You look at the screen wrong? Disconnected.    edit the second: for frequent fliers, use magnifying glass> guest > checked out > field: lastname, to copy previous stay info. Include the comma. Notes section is limited in character space. I've sent longer tweets. DNR is an optional VIP code corporate has to load and will not notify you of DNR status when copying a res or making a res from scratch. You have to physically open the previous stay starred as VIP to see if they're DNR or not. Unless you use the VIP code exclusively to notate DNRs and ignore VIPs.    Also, if you skip the res wizard and go right to 'finish', click in the name field. some DLs with magnetic strips can be swiped and will auto-fill the guest's name. If you click in the cc field and swipe the cc, it will prompt you to update the guest's name to the name on the CC.  magnifying glass > guest > reserved will show all pending reservations. it will pull guest name, arrival/departure, room type and rate plan. you can also sort it alphabetically by last name, by rate plan, arrival or departure date, and room number if the room is pre-blocked. this is my preferred method of searching for pending reservations in case the name was spelled wrong or the arrival date they're quoting is incorrect.      opening a res and clicking the envelope (f5, i think? i'm at home F8- it's the messages button) will allow you to leave messages accessible by the staff about the guest, as well as put in special requests and wake up call times.  reports can be generated from reports > front office > message center filtered by type (ie wake up call, messages, special request). if you offer rollaways and charge for them, you can tweak the system settings to auto-post the rollaway fee at audit; HOWEVER the fee is not auto-added to the total stay cost on the reg card or in the system. so if they're staying 5 days and you're charging $10/night for the rollaway, you have to manually add in the 50 to the payment.    i dislike how groups are blocked in the system but previous management didn't use the group blocking option due to either ignorance or personal preference and I haven't played with that too much.    audit auto posts everything except payment on no show reservations; those have to be manually posted.    sometimes when checking out guests, the system doesn't refresh right away leading to a checked out guest remaining in the system to be re-checked out to an inattentive eye and payment will be double-posted. I see this A LOT.    make sure when searching checked out guests you specify a last name or an arrival or departure date when you search it will pull data from the beginning of time and will crash. you'll have to force-close and re login.    you cannot keep multiple credit cards on file for a guest, and as far as I've seen there is no way to preauth a cc for any amount other than room+tax. (unless you overrode the rate to say, $20, got an approval, changed the guarantee and adjusted the room rate back to the correct rate. however, management can toggle off rate override privileges for FDAs so that may be a no-go. The only other way would be to manually do it in the external cc interface used for batching). Furthermore, if you type the guest's CC into the notes section, the system will mask the card number.   all of this is assuming, of course, that I'm using the same/similar system  edit 15: one thing i really do like about this system, however, is that it doesn't save anything unless you prompt it to. that way if you fuck up, it's not permanent and you can backpedal your way out of a clusterfuck with no repercussions  and start again from scratch"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3cssx1,chupacuntbra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"here's some more nuggets:    when putting a room out of order, if you select 'update all dates' (or even if you don't) if a pending reservation is pre-blocked for that room, it will not put the room out of order. you have to find the reservation that is pre-blocked with that specific room number during the time period you're trying to put the room out of order- you can change the room number, or highlight & delete the room number and save.    in the same vein, if you need to adjust charges on a checked out folio and the room the guest had stayed in has since been put out of order or out of inventory, you have to put the room back in order/inventory before you can save any adjustments.    meeting room charges have to be posted via a company or group folio.    if a lot of adjustments have been made to a guest's folio, or they have stayed for an extended period of time, if you open the folio and F4 to print, select 'STAY SUMMARY' from the drop-down at the top of the window and 'RUN' before you print the folio and it will provide a summary grouped by charge type for the duration of the stay. Instead of each date having (at least!) three lines for room charges, tax 1, tax 2 and taking 30 sheets of paper to print, it'll summarize charges by charge type and payment method for the entire stay, printing only one sheet.    shift+F4 will let you pick and choose which postings are printed off, also. particularly helpful if you don't want the guest to see adjustments/reversals on their final bill, but the guest needs it itemized nightly instead of a summary.     in the full view of the res, clicking the FULL NAME button will allow you to register additional guests to the room, and allow you to split charges by percent or dollar amount."

But the biggest shortcuts I can recommend are to make multiple reservations one at a time (select the first reservation and ""insert"" and it will copy name, address, phone, email, notes, and credit card, leaving you to enter the checkin/checkout dates), and have tech support's number on speed dial.  The system slows down like nothing else, as it searches through every hotel's entire history to pull up any information. Sunday mornings are the absolute worst, as every active hotel is checking out a total of millions of guests.  If you have access to manager's tools, you can cut off reservation lines or change rates, but you'll still want to mostly get direction from the boss on doing it, and you can reset passwords for your coworkers.  One hidden function of SoftHotel is the ability to change room types for an uneditable reservation (SOE, SOO, and other third party reservations that shouldn't be modified normally). Go into the Room View screen (F2), and click the button right next to the room number field. Select the new room type and assign a room, and it will force the system to accept the change."

But most of the problems with the system are actually things my boss does(or doesn't do). For instance, my boss doesn't know how to route a group to a Direct Bill group. This makes it so that the group can't check out without him doing something about it(which he always pushes off a good week before finally checking them out), meaning we have to route all transactions if they aren't already, move the master res to a room that doesn't exist (PM 9XXX), and extend the stay.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3cmqj7,proximacentauri77,3,Thu Jul 9 03:46:31 2015 UTC,"Section 13. The Sound Princess of article  Toilets in Japan:       Many Japanese women are embarrassed at the thought of being heard by others during urination  (see paruresis). To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process.  As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s  that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the Otohime (音姫 ?, lit. ""Sound Princess,"" also homophone with a legendary goddess Otohime). This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded.  The Otohime may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to 20 liters of water per use.  However, some women believe that the Otohime sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the Otohime.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3ch1kr,oversoldbutitllwash,7,Tue Jul 7 22:49:35 2015 UTC,"Hoo boy. The thing is, while the kids can be unruly and bad, the parents are the real problem. The kids are easier to control, the parents are the real troublemakers.   *Parents are the ones that expect the hotels staff to babysit their little ones.   *Parents are the ones that get drunk and become complete fucktards  *Parents are the ones that verbally and occasionally physically abuse staff  *Parents are the ones that demand everything, try to scam free things, complain about EVERYTHING etc.  *Parents are the ones that encourage the kids to act out, whether on purpose or not.   You, Mr. Coach are an awesome guy, and I know you can make sure your players are on their best behavior. But unless you have authority over the parents, the whole thing is kind of out of your control."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3ch1kr,cxtx3,3,Wed Jul 8 07:49:08 2015 UTC,"This. My best advice? Sit down with all the chaperones beforehand and go over some ground rules about not just the expectations for the kids behavior, but the adult's behavior as well. Set some ground rules and guidelines and you should be okay. Hopefully.  Also, as far as the kids, setting rules and expectations with them is good too, and please set a curfew for them. Something one of my leaders did when I was a kid on school trips staying in hotels was that he would put a piece of tape on each door after the kids would turn in for the night. Then, if the tape was broken by morning, there would not be a way for the kid to fix it and he would know who was up to some mischief. Just let the kids that that is what you are doing and there will be disciplinary action for those who break curfew.  Basically just establish yourself as alpha and make sure that both the front desk and everyone in your party has a way to contact you in case of any incident. Your cell phone number should be given to the desk in case they need to contact you should the need arise. If you do these things, you should set yourself up for a good trip!

Good; makes it easier sorting out who actually belongs on that floor and even on the property. I have a feeling noise complaints will be common during the nights of the conventions so, from someone having to clean up that type of mess, it's one more thing to help out and make a quick ID.   Not sure how they're locking out the elevators (RFID chip to be able to activate the call button?), but someone will find a way to work around it most likely."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3ce63f,proximacentauri77,3,Wed Jul 8 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"a lot of folks are pissed they can't stuff 10 to a room and get away with it any more.   THIS is exactly why many hotel folk hate dealing with these types of conventions. Stuffing 10 people in a room is a fire hazard, and opens the doors wide for noise complaints. Plus, 10 people in a room sounds unheard of; the max occupancy to a room at my hotel is 6 people. 10 is ridiculous. And the staff isn't there to babysit or clean up after convention attendees.  Basically, if you behave like children, you get treated like children. It sounds like the hotel has had problems with your group in the past, which you admit to with cramming people in rooms (I can image the headache that probably gave the hotel night staff), and so they have enacted these measures to make sure attendees adhere to hotel policy.  Look at it this way; they are willing to rent you their venue again, provided you follow the rules. They can easily say fuck you and refuse to host your convention if it gives them too many problems, and cramming 10 people into a room is probably screwing them out of potential revenue, so dropping your convention would probably ease the burden on the hotel. But they haven't dropped your convention; they simply asked for attendees to behave like grown ups. Bravo to the hotel for that."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3ce63f,AKBlackWizard,2,Wed Jul 8 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, and I'm not the owner of the convention, I'm just your regular convention attendee.  :)  Kind of funny that you mention the ""behave like children"", because a lot of the pissed folks were like ""they're treating us like children"".  I can understand why hotel staff would be pissed off due to overstuffing of rooms."

I know I'll probably catch flak for this, but I inflated the rate to force her hand a bit because I knew I couldn't provide the environment for her that she needed at that moment in her life. She made the call and I had her sit at my desk while she waited for someone from the shelter to pick her up so she could be watched over.    I second guess that decision a lot since I couldn't be completely sure of her reaction and I didn't want to force her away with the rate and not be able to provide some sliver of security, but I got lucky in that things turned out well."

We have no way to realistically enforce a prohibition on alcohol in the guest rooms, nor do we have the will as it would likely cost us a decent amount of our guest base, as our guests are largely blue-collar who want to come back after work for a few beers in their room before going to bed.    And honestly, we still have rules on belligerence, noise, etc. that include potential eviction - so we enforce those, we enforce the open containers in public spaces per our liquor license, and that's that."

A friend worked audit there for awhile and he said the BW training was mostly about the brand and general customer service and the audit training was all based on how the PMS ran the audit and how the owners wanted it reported (I guess they had different reports than what the PMS generated)."

As luck would have it, the next person to walk through the door wanting to check in was there on a free night. Of course, I didn't know how to process this (since it was manual at the time) so they had to wait until the guy training me came back down. Well, while they were waiting the wife starts having stomach pain. Turns out that they had just come from the ER and she was reacting to the medication that she was given.  Right as this happened, the fire department arrives for the first guest. Our security guard (who had just walked in the door himself) pulled one of the firefighters aside who tended to her while a second ambulance was dispatched.

My favorites are that the pool roof leaks so bad I dint have to fill it when it rains, and only two of my six doors to outside (not including the front) work. One of them doesn't even have the card reader anymore, it's just wires sticking out of the wall.  Speaking of cheap owners, this guy won't even get a chemical to remove wallpaper glue from them tearing down this incredibly strip of something off the wall. He actually tried to make me use a towel with just water to clean it off."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c6xqy,hotel_girl985,2,Mon Jul 6 10:38:42 2015 UTC,"We're a brand new hotel, so you think we'd have little to no issues right?  Yeah, no. Our housekeeping has the biggest group of drama hounds I have ever seen.  There are a few good workers, not going to put them down in the same group together.  But there are 4-5 bad eggs in HK that drive me up the wall.  I work front desk/driver/housewoman to get my 40 hours in the summer and desk pt during school.  There's no head houseman/woman so everyone assumes I am and comes to me with problems from the crap that isn't done.  And the drama hounds constantly complain to me about problems and spread shit to me.  I don't have the pay grade to give much of a rat's butt about what they tell me.  So usually I ignore what they say. One of the housemen is the laziest sob I've ever met.  He spends his whole 8 hour shift on his phone hiding in the pool/fitness center/etc, granted who he replaced was fired because (redacted hotel brand executive) found him sleeping in a closet.  Fun times.  So my managers are simply happy to have someone in the houseman slot that isn't sleeping in closets.  Best thing is that he's been wearing jeans to work and I almost lost my shit at my manager the other day because of it.  She says they didn't have any pants for him.  They didn't have any for me when I first started and she said I had to buy some - no big deal for me then, I went to Khols and bought a pair for 10$ on sale.  She tells me today that she found a pair for him and said she'd have to ""make him wear them"" and it in context sounded as if he wanted to show up to work in jeans every day and she'd only frown at him and let him.  I clenched my jaw and did my best not to lose it.  She is his boss.  This is a 4 start hotel. You do not wear jeans to work.  Even maintenance does not wear jeans. So one boss is a push over, but so is the rest of management. I could honestly walk out with half of the hotel and they wouldn't bat an eye.  It's frustrating. All of us at the front desk have realized we can not bust our asses in order to do our jobs well and instead do the same as those who simply coast by because no one checks on what we do.  This is either because they don't care or they don't have the time. Don't even get me started on the corners that were cut getting this hotel up so fast.  It's a beautiful hotel on the surface.  Already our marble top to the FD has cracked and looks like it's going to fall down, there are carpet spikes that near the bathrooms in the room that easily draw blood, complete hack job painting the stairwells and the AC doesn't work in a handful of rooms."

Next time you feel it building up, break away for a moment of quiet. Go to housekeeping to get stock for the front desk and take a little bit longer than necessary.  Restaurant people are known to go the walk in freezer for a scream when they need a break.  I miss the walk in."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c2fbc,chupacuntbra,2,Sat Jul 4 10:43:53 2015 UTC,The walk in fridge was my home last week. I was on my third 50+ hours week with no day off and I'd constantly sit in the fridge to get away from everyone and cry.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c2fbc,IJustCanNotEven,4,Sat Jul 4 08:10:31 2015 UTC,"I've done one before where the supervisor had stepped in thankfully, and the person still was complaining. They said something absolutely ridiculous which I forget, and I mumbled, I'm  so done' and walked off the desk  Don't worry we all get times we can't deal with it.  You'll be fine."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c2fbc,NejKidd,4,Sat Jul 4 10:13:09 2015 UTC,"We've all been there! I was a supervisor, and apparently wasn't giving Ms. NastyPinkLipstick what they wanted (and I don't even remember the exact problem because I blocked it out of my mind - it was that bad), because even after saying ""I'm trying to help you..."" she said in the NASTIEST tone, ""Are you even WORKING right now?"" I was so shocked and offended I ran in the back and started sobbing in front of my FOM and DOO.  Soooo props to you for actually standing up for yourself with your ""I can't even""! Wish I had the balls to do that."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c2fbc,bekwied,3,Sat Jul 4 14:16:14 2015 UTC,I've been there.  There There  hopefully this will cheer you up.

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3c2fbc,agrha,2,Sat Jul 4 14:09:50 2015 UTC,I yelled at a little Chinese guy this week because he said Bleakfast. Because there were that many stupid people before him. And then I felt really really bad.
