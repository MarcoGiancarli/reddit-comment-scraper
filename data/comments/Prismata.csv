Prismata,3e3kt5,toble007,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"Why aren't things like this done as a sort of challenge where Lunarch goes ""We think this combo isn't broken, so anyone who can beat us with it x out of y games proves us wrong and wins a free 'I Autowin this game' emote"" and do a whole bunch of custom games in a row with fixed player positions and no turn timer (to maximize time to come up with a counter)?  Then Lunarch makes appropriate balance changes."
Prismata,3e3kt5,mzomzo,2,Wed Jul 22 00:16:21 2015 UTC,I wonder if Aetherllama can beat Mike x out of y games without needing a broken combo. :P
Prismata,3e3kt5,MasN2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:35:04 2015 UTC,"Probably because ONLY that wouldn't be enough to warrant a balance change. Say in a vacuum a 2 unit combo is unbeatable for p1, but add in ANY 2 units that line now becomes utter and complete garbage."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Crash_overlord,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:16 2015 UTC,To clarify I don't mean BS+just the 2 units. I mean BS+2 units+ 6 randoms. Custom game can do that fine.
Prismata,3e3kt5,mzomzo,3,Wed Jul 22 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"That would be interesting, but they'd need a MASSIVE sample size and they'd actually have to be of equal skill for it to have any meaning. It doesn't matter if a tier 7 player has access to the best possible combo in prismata if I can just outplay him tactically.  Additionally it would take time away from actually developing a game. Now if lunarch was a big company with a separate team exclusive for game balance including some of the top prismata players that could be a great idea, but lunarch is just a small indie dev :S"
Prismata,3e3kt5,Crash_overlord,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:29:45 2015 UTC,"Well obviously the challenge is directed at top players. The sample size is small, but here's the current alternatives that seem to be used:  1) Let people whine on Reddit and have to write long explanations in response (uses Lunarchs time). 2) Wait for analytics to roll in and hope to sift through them well enough to discern the truth (still sample size problem). 3) Try out build after build after build in the Analyzer and then post these YouTube videos/blog posts (uses Lunarchs time).  So right now all the things being done still have the two problems you mention. Ideally the challenge would only apply when there clearly seems to be a problem and top players not only agree there's a problem, but also believe they can prove it.  Obviously someone like Allroc who is clearly a good player and strongly believes these situations exist and need addressing is a prime candidate for these.  Anyways, just an idea as once the game is more public I can only see these situations increasing."

Prismata,3e3kt5,TheCabIe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"I literally go back and buy a Drone instead at 12:15, the whole point was just to illustrate that buying Wall+Shadowfang every turn isn't the best.  The Conduit line is the most interesting one IMO. I actually think p1 has good chances there."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:58 2015 UTC,My bad. You are correct. Deleting my original post.
Prismata,3e3kt5,Synxisback2k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:22 2015 UTC,at 16:04 I believe it's a p1 win if instead of buying an engineer you work 3 more drones and build a wall. This results in a narrow win with only 3 attack left on p1's sideafter a few rounds of breaching and counterbreaching.
Prismata,3e3kt5,disposable_username5,5,Tue Jul 21 21:55:24 2015 UTC,yeah I saw this and commented about it too.
Prismata,3e3kt5,Synxisback2k,3,Tue Jul 21 22:07:47 2015 UTC,"I really liked this video! It made me feel like I did before I actually got a key and started playing the game. Looking back I realize Elyot and Will's approach to the game was a huge factor in how excited I was for Prismata.  This video isn't about establishing whether P1 or P2 wins, it's about showing that playing well is not trivial at all, both when provided or facing a seemingly overwhelming opening. It made me remember how simply trying to find good, creative ways to play is already fun by itself. If the game I'm playing showcases a standard build and a crazy rebuttal attempt, I actually don't mind losing it on either side as long as I feel like I gave it my all.  TL;DR: thank you for reminding me that I'm here for crazy beautiful games rather than wins."

Prismata,3e3kt5,DON-ILYA,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:39 2015 UTC,Conduit nerf to 4E incoming... :P  (not)
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that shadowfang/FA doesn't need to be nerfed. I think shadowfang/FA/infusion grid might still have a decent chance to be unbeatable even with 5 other random units, but that's a 3 unit combo, which seems rare enough to be okay.  However... I also think shadowfang/bloodpact is and always was the more problematic unit combination, and I do think that this one actually does lead to auto wins in quite a few base + 8 sets. No idea why no-one is complaining about that."
Prismata,3e3kt5,siIverspawn,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"Shadowfang + Pact is pretty insane; do you know of a specific set or build that you think is broken?  P1 might be favoured in some cases, but I think after DD/DD DD/DA, p1 might want to open AA but p2 going RR leads to something very complex. I do not know who wins.  With more general sets, stuff is wide open. I think D/AA for p2 might be viable in some cases!"
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,5,Tue Jul 21 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"The youtube comment which said   so to 'counter' sf/animus you have to build against it before you even see ANY clue of it happening.   riiiight   Is exactly how I feel about this. It seems like every time I see a ""counter"" line like this they treat it like a static puzzle where the opponent's line is locked and don't consider how Prismata actually works. You have to consider timings and degrees of committal.  For example, in this supposed counter line you build a Conduit before your opponent has built a single tech building. That's like saying gauss cannons beat Tatsu Rush if you go early conduit, which is equally flawed because once you show that conduit no one in their right mind is going to go Tatsu rush.  This also doesn't consider any other units existing. Testing Base + 1 or 2 units is always flawed in that respect."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Allroc,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry if I didn't explain this a bit more clearly. The p2 2.. DDC might seem like it's just prophylactic (deterring a specific build that p1 isn't obligated to play), but it's game-theoretically optimal to play in situations like these.  After opening DD/DD, p1 doesn't have many options for turn 3. DDC might be playable but feels weak against p2's DDC, so I'd guess that DDA, DDB, and AA are the relevant options. AA and DDA both seem to lose to a p2 Flame + Shadowfang rush after DDC, so p2 can assume DDB into Flame Animus + Shadowfang will be p1's game plan.  By not opening DD/A or DD/DDE, player 1 is already being somewhat committed to a mid-econ standard build, so p2's job is to minimax against that, and in particular, should play in a way that is strongest against p1's strongest option(s).  Point is: even after DDC, I think p1's next turn should be DDB. (Though maybe there is another line that I'm not seeing?)"
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,3,Tue Jul 21 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"Thing is, what if that natural conduit isn't good? Often times that opens you up to a lot of counter options in real sets with 8 or more units, especially if the green options are very limited (given that 2 of the units are already Fang and FA this is likely).  If the only way to stand a chance against a specific line is to commit to a tech building first, there's a problem. My main point is that testing the strength of combos in BSO often gives unrealistic results, such as when we were testing the first live version of Wincer rush in BSO, it turned out actually going high econ second Wincer was correct. Strange stuff like that happens in Base + single unit or combo, which is why I really dislike it as a measurement tool."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Allroc,2,Tue Jul 21 21:18:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you in general here. However in this case what are the actual numbers on the percentage of games that have both Shadowfang and Flame Animus, no relevant green options, and no units that give p2 more options to play with? At what percentage do you call it a problem?  Every set is a forced win or draw so you really have to set a hard line for how much human advantage in what percent of sets is problematic.  We don't have the data to actually talk much about that since Lunarch keeps that all to themselves. Loonark pls! Give us the data!  Your point about the strength of combos in a vacuum vs real sets is addressed in the video. This specific one is very easily spoiled by a ton of units. Unlike your Wincer example where any freeze or burst just made p2 win, I think most units help beat the Shadowfang and Flame Animus rush."
Prismata,3e3kt5,mrguy888,3,Tue Jul 21 22:48:53 2015 UTC,"It's also a 2-unit combo, less worrisome than a 1-unit Wincer blowout that works with a huge number of other enablers."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,5,Tue Jul 21 23:29:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what you're saying about the flaw of treating these type of scenarios as ""static puzzles"", P2 is simply getting a natural conduit there. They hardly have to go out of their way to prevent this specific build from dominating.  So it is true that in this case P2 is kind of forced to get a natural conduit which might not be good in that specific set, but unless a 3rd engi is required, getting a natural conduit is rarely truly bad.   This also doesn't consider any other units existing. Testing Base + 1 or 2 units is always flawed in that respect.   Also agreed about this. I can't say for sure, but I think there are more units that benefit P1's build than there are units that allow P2 to counter-pressure this mega efficient build for P1."
Prismata,3e3kt5,TheCabIe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"Try this experiment for yourself: play Base + Flame Animus + Shadowfang + 6 other random units.  Sometimes you do come across units that help one player more than the other (e.g. Infusion Grid fits in more nicely to p1's build than p2's build). But most of the time, it's really hard to establish that either player has an advantage. Even if you learn/study all the relevant lines in base + FA + Shadowfang, most of it gets thrown out the window in a real game.  I'm actually inclined to think that p2 is helped a little more than p1 on average, just because green units are useless in lines where p1 doesn't get a Conduit. Stuff like Aegis/Plexo/Barrier is so amazingly good that p1 probably should get a Conduit, but p2 can take more advantage by storing up lots of green."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,3,Tue Jul 21 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"I am not convinced that this line is a counter, but probably this is the best p2 response because everything else loses and this is probably the least explored approach. However since both sides made walls when they shouldn't have, the whole analysis is flawed."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Steel_hs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"Sorry for my lousy analysis-mode piloting skills that made it unclear; the line I explored most was (1= flame animus, 2 = shadowfang):  DD/DD  DD/DDC  DDB/DDB  1A/1A  2W/2W  Then p1 has a bunch of options. 2W I flashed on the board for a moment but undid, 2D was what I played. 2DE is basically the same (2D gives p1 a few more options though). 2C is very interesting and I didn't explore it in this video.  Is there a Wall after the 2D turn that you think was incorrect?"
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"It seems like if p2 goes 2C he actually wins straitforwardly, and p1 can't do anything. That wall is really not needed for p2 on that turn."
Prismata,3e3kt5,eX_ploit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"I explored p1 turn 5 2C a bit and it seems like an ""easy"" win for p1. So even though p2 CAN get that conduit, p1 can get his own, only 2 turns later, which is good enough with the attack lead. I would have to agree that this line is actually often ""weak"" when there's other things in the custom sets (GB attacker (plasma, tesla), nivos, cryos, plexos...) but it might still be some cause for concern if there are multiple units that give either player a very efficient flame animus opening (I feel it's more problematic than sf as far as player advantage goes)."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Crash_overlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Since you seem curious, there is another line as well that is sometimes playable for p2...  DD/DD  DD/DD  DDB/DAA  1A/2B (not 2R, which I'm pretty sure loses)  I think p1 can hold but it's close."
Prismata,3e3kt5,Elyot,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:33:50 2015 UTC,That wasn't even close -_-''.
Prismata,3e3kt5,Crash_overlord,3,Wed Jul 22 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"At about 16:02 in the video Elyot says something like ""I guess we can work with one drone and get an engineer"". When the correct play was working with 4 drones and getting a wall which would lead to an easy win for player 1"
Prismata,3e3kt5,Synxisback2k,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:54:37 2015 UTC,yeah but that doesn't really undermine the point of the video. it's just one line.
Prismata,3e3kt5,siIverspawn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:33 2015 UTC,What? Shadowfang+flameanimus+base wins for p1 quite easily. Which point of the video is not undermined?

If you choose not to, the opponent could always decide to do it anyway. If one option doesn't change, it serves you well to reduce the other option, regardless of which option you consider better.

Prismata,3dw288,shalevbd,2,Mon Jul 20 09:01:24 2015 UTC,"There is a UI issue with these units. If a unit is both frontline and fragile, a user may want to attack it for less than its hp. It's not clear how the user would communicate this.  For example, suppose my opponent is defending with 2 walls and has a non-defending fragile frontline unit with hp=4. Also suppose I'm attacking for 5. What's my best play? I should probably hit the frontline unit for 2 and be left with 3 attack, so that a wall dies. But how would I do this? If I click the frontline unit, that normally means I'm killing it (for 4 damage). There would need to be some sort of popup or something to let users specify the damage."
Prismata,3dw288,mzomzo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but are there any situations in the game right now where an attacker can specify less than lethal damage and still have attack left?

Prismata,3dw288,MasN2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe make it so that you can't assign partial damage to a frontline+fragile?  (In this case I have to choose between killing the frontline and killing the wall, but if I had only 2 attack, I could assign 2 to the frontline.)"
Prismata,3dw288,shalevbd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"But then if your attack was made of 5 steel splitters, you could activate only two of them, click the frontline unit, and then activate the remaining three. On the other hand, if your attack was made out of a steel splitter + plasmafier, you couldn't do this. This is ugly.  And it gets worse. Now suppose you have a plasmafier and two steel splitters, but you want to leave one of the steels for defense. In this case, your best option is to activate two steel splitters, click the frontline-fragile unit, activate the plasmafier, and then un-activate one of the steel splitters. This creates a situation you can only reach using undos, which is something we're strongly against."
Prismata,3dw288,MasN2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, can't you just cancel the attack, like what happens if you hit a fragile unit when breaching, then click an auride core?"

Also, units with two or more green in the cost are pretty even since p1 has a few nice double conduit opens to combat the natural conduit."
Prismata,3dnc9p,Apooche,2,Fri Jul 17 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"It's probably higher than 50%, like every green unit in sets without Synthesizer.

Prismata,3dilky,Elyot,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"The two really important units here are Iso and Redeemer, along with the presence of a strong defender.  The iso player's opportunity was the fact that the defender happened to be frontline. If he had only gotten two permanent attack, it would have been a completely different game - the redeemers would have effectively cost 10B more.   All he needed to do was build one off-beat iso, but I think it never occured to him not to sync them.   Really frustrating to watch xD"

In your specific set: Omega is a good defender and an even better atacker. Antima is a really good pressure unit but not that easy to execute, i´m not even sure in this set. Fission is super value for the cost if u are using the ability into more fissions, forcefields and gaus charges so i think: Omega is the go for it unit. Then u have the choice to go Tarsier or Fission, maybe both but i wouldnt skip Fissions! Allways think about Antima: is your Opponent to gready go for it (later multicolour in this set is good cause of fissions and tassier etc.) If he is going for it, try defend on Omega and outeco your opponent.  Drones, hmm for BBBG maybe 20 if u want RR aswell take them all but thats probably to slow.  Thermits are nice too, maybe importand if your Opponent defends on Omega."
Prismata,3dj5xs,Paranoijaa,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"4# how many drones i need for that   I dont think thats important for beginners. I know its said in the tutorial that you should stop building drones after the start but i disagree. just get a drone whenever you have gold left to do tho.  In general the first thing i look at in a set is if theres a (reasonable) defender with absorb 3 or higher. If thats the case I go 3rd engi and high econ, if not I dont."
Prismata,3dj5xs,SirGaribaldi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the general tips :)  I didn't know exactly what to look for when I saw the random set. I'll try to look for that!
Prismata,3dj5xs,fdsdfg,3,Thu Jul 16 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"Similar to what Paranoijaa said.   1 What will be my best defender by the time a typical build threatens with Tarsiers?  Often this will be a wall, but sometimes Hannibul or something will be around. In your game the answer is a wall, since omega splitter comes too late.   2 What will be the best absorber if the game goes late?  In your game the answer is Omega Splitter  3 What 'sneaky plays' do I have to look out for?  In your game, there's a really good combo you have to watch out for. Building a few fission turrets, then lots of engineers for a Comet, and on the turn the comet hatches, using all those engineers to cash out the Fission Turrets and build gauss charges. Really strong breach potential! Be wary of this!  In other games, the answer might be a fast Flame Animus + Shadowfang opening, or early Centrifuge that allows a Centurion to get played very early, nullifying any early aggression.   4 Which units are stronger/weaker thanks to the set?  Vivid drones, the 12GGGR Scorpion (forget the name), and many others are not a good idea when Apollo is in the set. If Defense Grid is in the set, an early Centurion makes little sense. Or maybe the set has Synthesizer, meaning that Defense Grid doesn't require the Blastforge investment it normally does, while allowing you to spend the G on some offensive units that may be present.  Don't just look at this with 'ooh, I should combo synthesizer -> xeno guardian -> drake', think about the fact that your opponent might do this, what will give it away, and what you can do to beat it.   5 Assuming I make my move before the opponent, what should I go for?  In most cases, the beginning of the game will naturally be building drones. If your opponent tech's first, you can react to it knowing the above information. But there will be a point where it's better for you to tech than wait for him - usually between turns 3-5. What will be your plan if you get to make this first move?  That's about as far as I go. The rest is reactionary."
Prismata,3dj5xs,eX_ploit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips :) Really nice ones and very useful. Probably my biggest mistake was not thinking about trying to counter my opponent build but just trying to be as efficient as I could. I will try to add this extra thought.  Thanks for the advice and good game :)
Prismata,3dj5xs,Apooche,2,Fri Jul 17 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"On turn 11 you missed an opportunity to kill 2 Steelsplitters.  Also you should never allow yourself getting breached even for 0. Especially so when a powerful unit like Omega is one of the blockers. If you don't have enough money for defense, start sacrificing drones."

Prismata,3dj0lw,grinder222,2,Fri Jul 17 05:37:12 2015 UTC,"no, I don't see my logic failing. Insults come and go with fashion like most things, I actually even remember a time when I went to school where people were calling each other 'Jude' (which is german for jew), and I doubt any of them seriously hated jews. Is it stupid to adapt it as a swear word? Well, yeah, you could say that. But I don't think apes hates jews, and I don't even think he had that on his mind when he used the word, which is why I don't consider it antisemitism.  Note also that cary said he's jewish but not offended - if he isn't, why should we be?"
Prismata,3dj0lw,siIverspawn,0,Fri Jul 17 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"hen he used the word, which is why I don't consider it antisemitism. Note also that cary said he's jewish but not offended - if he isn't, why should   He's one person. I am jewish and offended. Yes of course it's stupid to adapt ""jew"" as a swear word, are you even serious?"
Prismata,3dj0lw,grinder222,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"It's not that stupid. Most swear words originally describe real types of persons or other things that aren't inherently bad. I wouldn't consider calling someone a jew to be worse than calling someone a retard or a whore or gay - neither of which would probably provoke this kind of reaction, or cause homosexuals or prostitutes or people with disabilities to feel personally offended.  That said, I'm not arguing for how you should feel; if you're offended then you're offended. I just don't think there's any basis to ban someone simply because he used an insult."
Prismata,3dj0lw,siIverspawn,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"All of the examples you cite have the potential to be very offensive. I personally am offended to some extent by all of them (and I am not homosexual, disabled, or a prostitute).  What if, instead of ""jewy frog"", the person in question here had said ""black baboon""? I don't think anyone would be trying to defend them then, but here you are defending pretty much the exact same thing.  EDIT: wait, no, people would still try to defend them. This is, after all, the Internet, where the stupid knows no bounds."
Prismata,3dj0lw,twofootedgiant,2,Sat Jul 18 08:10:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, if someone calls you a retard, you'll be offended (and so will many others). What I meant though was that third parties wouldn't be offended just by hearing those terms (or if that's what you meant, then I misunderstood you).  I don't think 'black baboon' warrants a ban either. I really don't think any single insult comes anywhere close to a ban.  A good example of why is your last paragraph. You manage to be offensive without directly insulting anyone. The amount of swear words used is generally not an accurate metric for how offensive something is."
Prismata,3dj0lw,siIverspawn,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:07 2015 UTC,I would be in favor of a chat ban or temporary chat ban in similar situations.
Prismata,3dj0lw,jrkirby,3,Thu Jul 16 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Is this really antisemitism? It shouldn't be relevant but I'm jewish and find this quite tame.  If you browse any major twitch stream or video game forum you're going to see way worse than 'u look jewy'. The fact that there aren't teams prevents a lot of the type of rage you see in games like LoL, and I also feel that this game has a higher intellectual bar then the places where those attitudes are the worst.  I personally wouldn't support chat bans for anything other than repeated personal attacks. I think a default on language filter like many games have would be a wise implementation before the devs pursue the mass market."
Prismata,3dj0lw,caryjays,4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:38 2015 UTC,Not sure why being considered tame would disqualify it from being considered antisemitism. Does it have to be a certain level of vicious first? O_o  I do agree this instance probably doesn't warrant a ban of any sort.
Prismata,3dj0lw,4nonym0u5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"It definitely has to be a certain level of vicious first. Save the word antisemitism for actual discrimination, otherwise you get something of a a boy who cried wolf effect.

Prismata,3dj0lw,caryjays,7,Thu Jul 16 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"How does that make sense. If you hit someone but only lightly, apparently it doesn't count as a hit because it didn't break a rib? Like many other things,  antisemitism is on a continuum. It may not be as oppressively antisemitic as something else but to say it's not at all is ridiculous. Actions also don't exist in a vacuum. Prejudice often manifests in multiple ways. How much can you really respect Jewish people if you are okay with referring to someone as like a jew as an insult?  ... Also, I already agreed there should be no repercussions for this one incident, so there's that."
Prismata,3dj0lw,4nonym0u5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:50:09 2015 UTC,"Is physical violence really the proper analogy in this case?  You talk about a continuum of anti semitism, but you say accepting this one superficial comment disqualifies me from respecting my own ancestry?  Respect is for individuals not groups... That is a form of generalization and racism in and of itself isn't it? There are Jews I respect and Jews I don't... And I can say the same about Russians and Koreans, waiters and bankers, Mormons and Hippies, etc. Respect should be independent of looks, religion, class, ethnicity, no?"

But assuming people should take automatic offence just by reading simple words is an insult to those peoples intelligence
Prismata,3dj0lw,Synxisback2k,6,Fri Jul 17 13:22:02 2015 UTC,"""the people who seem to take offence to words like nigger and faggot are usually straight and white.""   this is so lol wrong."
Prismata,3dj0lw,grinder222,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"You... you are aware of the history behind those words right? At least a little? And of the fact that the problems they are related to are far from dealt with?  There's a pretty simple thought experiment to perform before saying ""yes but those words didn't mean that / it was irony"": would someone genuinely antisemitic (or racist, or sexist, ...) say that precise sentence in context?  In this case, we have a player angry at another who reacts by calling them a ""kike"" and a ""jewy frog."" Would someone hating Jews say something like that in that situation? Yup, totally. So no irony. So it's right to take offense, and if the person insulting really didn't mean that and realizes their mistake they can apologize and move on."
Prismata,3dj0lw,Auxeras,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:31 2015 UTC,That's a dumb test. A racist might also say Good Game unironically but that doesn't make it a racist statement.
Prismata,3dj0lw,mzomzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, because saying ""gg"" doesn't involve racist insults. You're coming at this backwards. Basically my argument is similar to this one.  Fundamentally the question isn't to determine if someone is racist or not in the depths of their mind. That's impossible to do until one invents mindreading so no point bothering.  On the other hand you can take what a person said at a given moment, in a given context, and try to tell whether that statement was racist (or sexist, ...). Here it was pretty obvious. Too bad you can't copy text easily from global chat, I was online when it happened, maybe seeing the exact lines would help."

Prismata,3dbb08,DontBe_Tamad,5,Wed Jul 15 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"As a noobish Prismata player, many time I feel I can't afford a breach because of the loss of the biggest defender. I sort of agree with the article, when it is mainly base set only. It is not too bad to replace a wall / steelsplitter (5~6B) when that is your biggest absorber, but when something like centurion is in play then losing it is fatal in my mind (also mentioned in the article).   I think the problem for me is that the big defenders come up often and aren't as rare as a single unit HP attacker like Lucina. And it don't get the big defender when your opponent does, then your chances of winning aren't so good.  Not sure how to quite mathematically phrase it, but in my mind, you aren't just losing [N-1] HP worth of defenders when you allow a breach but [N-1] HP + (remaining turns till eventual endgame breach * (max absorber HP - 1)). You guys once mentioned that absorb is the most OP mechanic, so it has stuck till my mind. And more often than not, replacing it is not possible due to 1 unit supply, or it not being prompt, even if you have enough resources, and it might not make sense to get backups like Xeno Guardian.  Maybe, I am just overrating the effective extra HP due to absorb, but here is a newbie's two cents."
Prismata,3dbb08,neetocin,3,Wed Jul 15 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way: you have 3 Walls 2 Engineers and an Energy Matrix and they have 3 frostbites and 7 damage. If you hold a drone to defend they won't use the bites and you lose 6b, the cost of the wall and the gold to hold the drone. If you don't hold the drone and they freeze you lose 13bb which is a difference of 7b. Ignoring the cost of delay they spent 6rrr to do that extra 7b. That is pretty close to even despite losing 4 absorb that turn.  In cases where non prompt defenders like Xeno or Infusion are your best absorbers you can actually do better by defending so that the breach is slightly not worth it and buying another Xeno or Infusion rather than buying another wall to fully defend the breach.  It might be close impossible to do exact calculations in game but once you understand the stuff your gut estimation will get better results than just defending fully."

Prismata,3dbb08,mrguy888,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. The old Brooder felt too similar to the old Frostbites. We want to create different situations, different gameplay, different strategies. This accomplishes that. Plus, it's a lot of fun."

Prismata,3dbb08,randomflyingtaco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"How exactly does it makes it different from buying bites? Sure bites are definitely similar to brooder in some ways, but I always thought one of the core identity of the brooder was being forced into a situation where you are 'buying' more bites than you want to. And that can make the freeze math really complicated, simply deciding whether to blow all your freeze and breach or not can be a tough decision.  Whereas, in a standard game of frostbites getting into a position where having 10~ bites on the field at once is usually far from the optimal line of play."
Prismata,3dbb08,DoomedToothless,2,Wed Jul 15 11:20:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, Frostbite and Frost Brooder weren't the same unit before. But now they are even more different, in a way that I think is good for diversity of gameplay."
Prismata,3dbb08,Elyot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"Belated response:   The old Brooder felt too similar to the old Frostbites.    I'd argue that they are more different than Gauss Fabricator and Kinetic Driver.   (2) Working/attacking with some of those units instead to gain gold/attack from them, but allow your opponent to blow 5 Frostbites to breach and kill a Tarsier.   With the old frostbites: Say I buy 3 frostbites and you defend with 2 extra walls  My options: Option A) Blow the frostbites, trading 6RRR for 2 absorb and the ability to assign 2 damage to tarsiers. This is effectively trading 6RRR for 2 tarsiers. Good deal.  Option B) Don't blow the frostbites, and trade 6RRR for 10BB. This also happens to be a good deal.  I've always agreed that you must partially defend the frostbites. My arguement was just that frostbites are too efficient for this. With frostbite at 2R with buildtime 2 (this is effectively 3R with interest), frostbite is still more efficient, (that is what you get for defending against frostbites with Walls and Tarsiers) and the 2 gold difference will win games, but it isn't crazy. The other complaint about the old frostbites is that front-ended units will lead to autowins. Frostbite is the ultimate in front-ended units. Against Tarsiers, Omega Splitter, or Centurion, Frostbite is ""2R: your opponent has 4B (5B against Centurion) less next turn), allowing a losing player to switch to double (or triple, if the game happens to be in high econ, but that shouldn't happen with frostbites) animus frostbites, and lock his opponent down in that way to win the game. The loop is:  Player A buys 2 Animus Player B buys 2 Animus in responce Player A buys 4 Frostbite Player B buys 0 frostbite, having spent his money on defence Player A, having not spent his money on defence, buys 4 more frostbite. Player B is now blocking with all his drones. Player A buys 4 more frostbite. Player B gets breached, losing his Centurion, Drones, Tarsiers and the game.  Buildtime 2 slows down this loop, as it does for most front ended units.  Frost Brooder is a weaker unit, but more hate was against it, as it was more efficient at massing up frostbites. However, I felt Frost Brooder was okay for 3 reasons. A) in a transition to breachproof, the Frost Brooder player can't refund his new frostbites, while the Frostbite player can stop purchasing at any point. B) Frost Brooder is slow, preventing the above feedback loop. C) A player against Frost Brooder can mass engineers for protection against Brooder, and buy 1 wall per turn to take the damage. This cannon be done against Frostbite for 2 reasons. First the Engineers don't immediately respond to the frostbite, and second, the Frostbite player can just not purchase more frostbites to make this engineer strategy worthwhile.   This meant Frost Brooder was restricted to 2 uses: as a 1 of purchase for value against a Tarsier based attack, and used en masse against extremely breach vulnerable and chill vulnerable units, such as defence grid, centurion, walls, lucina, and shadowfang.  The new Frost Brooder is significantly weaker. Although not nerfed as hard as frostbite, it started with a low power level, and both uses cannot be done effectively. It is now a 3 (average of 2/3/4) buildtime endotherm kit which contains 3 frostbites. It instead serves a very niche use of using the frostbites for value against lifespan blockers and big absorbers(rarely non-granular defence)"

Prismata,3dbb08,eX_ploit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:08:38 2015 UTC,I suppose the main issue is perception. If a lot of players feel really bad when playing vs certain types of units/mechanics (HS devs keep bringing up discard from hand as something they don't want to do since a lot of players react negatively to it from their research) then education and explanation on the subject will help very little unless someone is really committed to the game and is willing to go out of their way to learn (like make a forum post). Majority of players won't care though and might quit the game as a result. So it's a tough job to maintain game complexity and accessibility.
Prismata,3dbb08,4nonym0u5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"Discard is a bad example because it really is a bad game mechanic for CCG's(what's the point of constructing your deck when you can't even play the frigging cards), while I feel like chill is a really good game mechanic, but with a too-high skill requirements(which is not really bad but prismata needs more tutorials to teach lower level players about intricacies of chill)"

Prismata,3dbb08,4nonym0u5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"Counterspells can be bad for an online games as constantly having to pass the chance to play one back and forth makes for really slow games. This is especially bad with asynchronous play. Something like auto-triggered ""trap cards"" (aka counterspells that you have to play face down to set them up first) can be a better version in this case."

Prismata,3dchfw,fdsdfg,2,Wed Jul 15 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"No, you didn't lose on turn 18, you lost much earlier. You started losing somewhere on turn 11 when he bought a second Redeemer. If you don't believe me just go back to replay and count how much permanent attack both you and him had each turn starting at turn 11. He always had more and the difference was growing every turn. Damage in prismata usually matters much more than defense or economy, because it's more cost-effective most of the time.   In this game specifically Redeemers were extremely efficient both as damage and the fact that they can't be killed by apollo, plus your opponent also built Xeatron, which is can be used as a good absorber, so that your not that big damage was nullified even more and you couldn't finish him off."
Prismata,3dchfw,eX_ploit,3,Wed Jul 15 05:38:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, it was a losing situation from around turn 10 or 11. However, I disagree with the reasons why. The redeemers weren't efficient here at all, since all of the damage the gauss charges did mattered (i.e. none got absorbed). Sure, they can't be sniped by apollo, but OP wasn't sniping damage anyway.  I think the main problem was that your Iceblades just weren't very good OP. In particular the first ones you bought, just as your opponent got to 6 damage, so he could deny absorb by killing them. But in general, your damage wasn't high enough for the iceblades to really apply enough pressure to be worth it. Hellhounds are so efficient, you should have probably just bought those instead with your red/blue tech."

Prismata,3d9lmh,hepcecob,13,Tue Jul 14 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"Adobe was somewhat unfortunate to have bought Flash when it wasn't in that great of a state. There's nothing too terrible about .swf as a format (well, there are a few stupid things, but it mostly doesn't matter)... however, the current Flash Player is still, even after many years of patching, a little bit buggy, and people are still finding ways to exploit those bugs to build malicious Flash apps that bypass the typical browser security layer.  If you look at the history of Flash player updates, it's not pretty. There are many security updates every year, and each one of these typically corresponds to some hacker finding a new vulnerability in Flash. Of course, Adobe fixes these vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered, but this means that you have to constantly be running the latest version of Flash to ensure you aren't at risk (as soon as patches are issued, hackers often investigate the patch to see what was fixed, and then build exploits based off of that information to target people who haven't updated yet).  For a while now, Chrome has completely disabled older versions of the Flash Player to protect people from these vulnerabilities, and now Firefox is doing the same. It's a precautionary step, but there have been exploits in the past that are nasty enough to warrant it.  Note that even if you're running an outdated version of Flash, you can't be exploited just by playing Prismata. You'd have to go to a malicious or compromised web page that's hosting a malicious Flash file.  Also note that none of these problems affect games/apps made with Adobe Air, since you install them like normal games/apps. So when we make a Steam version or port the game to mobile, there will be no problems. And of course, we will release a non-steam desktop version as well.  We still want to keep web supported for as long as we can (especially for things like replay links), and Flash continues to be the best medium for that (though HTML5 canvas is catching up in a few ways).  Adobe Air does have a few issues on Steam... a big one is piracy (there is no way to DRM the games), but of course we don't care since we're offering a free-to-play game and wouldn't want to DRM it anyway.  Hope that clarifies things!"

It also can be used to penalize a slow-playing opponent for not being able to attack for much in the early turns if you play a couple quick conduits and some early Weeds that have time to ""spread"" before your opponent can deal with them, essentially giving you some free blockers.  EDIT: To avoid the problem of infinite growth, I've created a new mechanic named ""Capacity X"" that limits you to having only X of a unit at any one time. With Capacity 16, you can only have 16 of this unit maximum, so it's duplicate ability will do nothing once you reach 16 of them."
Prismata,3d9vx8,Qupu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"Problem is: it's exponential growth. In fact, it's a plain 2x. If I'm P1, I'll just go for DD - CC - 1DD, and unless my opponent goes double vore on turn 3, he won't be able to kill them quickly, and if he doesn't kill them quickly, he won't ever kill them.  The usual interest rate is about 4/3, this unit has an interest rate of 2. It will always either pretty bad or insanely good.  Another problem is that it constructs infinite units - and not just hypothetically, but very commonly. And yet another problem is that it's defensive rather than aggressive, so if both players do it you'll just have a tie. In fact, I think there's a pretty high chance that each and every game with this unit is a tie if both players play perfectly.  It's interesting as a thought experiment though."

Prismata,3d9vx8,Arkanishu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:11:45 2015 UTC,"I think you'd have to word it ""all units which can produce attack have their health lowered blah blah"" because otherwise you have ambiguity issues.  For example, if I had a tarsier and a militia, and I clicked the militia that turn, would its health be lowered? You could argue either way.    In its current form, I would really dislike it. Since it relies on being attacked, it doesn't promote strategy on either side. However, here's a derivative idea that I wouldn't hate I think is interesting:  Industrial Solvent (8GRR, 4 supply) 4 health  Fragile, maybe frontline  While this unit is in play, all opponent's non-blocking units are reduced in health by 1. When this unit dies, all opponent's non-blocking units are increased in health by 1 (up to their maximum)."

Prismata,3d9vx8,solforge123,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:44 2015 UTC,hmm... isn't berserker supposed to have more attack with lower health? Your unit is the opposite of that.
Prismata,3d9vx8,Dunkoro,2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:37 2015 UTC,this unit seems to be very bad. your opponent would just kill it right away so it would be 10 prompt defense and very overpriced for that.

Prismata,3d9vx8,odomobo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. I think there is at least one situation with the unit you aren't looking at, which actually leads me to think the unit has potential to be too strong:  In a big blue set where P1 opens DD, DDE, DDD, DDDB, DDDS, DSBB P2 can open DD, DDC, DDC, DD, DDAE, Berserker.  P2 loses an engineer while defending on turn 5, and has potential to lose two more or take two damage to the Berserker.  He then attacks for 8 which is pretty crazy (could potentially be less if P1 cuts some drones and buys earlier blastforges).  P2 can't do anything too exciting on 7, but can slam the remaining three on 8, 9, and 10, which could potentially do 20-30 dmg.  Arguably, these units are strong enough for you to play breachproof even if your opponent gets out an odin (and you haven't breachproofed your drones).  I'm not sure if there are any opens DD, DDE, DDD for P1 that don't allow P2 to get the turn 6 Berserker.  Either way, P2 is in a pretty strong position after natural conduiting on turn 2 and in most sets, the natural conduit is still a pretty good opening - the threat of Berserker limits greedy econ P1 plays, even if P2 ultimately doesn't go Berserker.  If both players were trying to get out Berserkers, I'm not sure who reaches it first, but the first player gets a blowout, which is possibly bad for design and also leads me to question if the unit is too strong."

Prismata,3d2ig4,DrD_Prismata,5,Mon Jul 13 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not much a fan of units that exist to counter or synergize with other units. I think games are most interesting when all units are somewhat viable, and this is hurt when units become strong from synergy or weak from counters. If units with this keyword are less efficient blockers than those without it, then they would be too weak in games without freezers, but if they're equally efficient then freezers would be too weak in games with them. I think this keyword would be cool in a game with some sort of deckbuilding aspect like Hearthstone, but because sets are chosen randomly it's desirable to construct units which aren't heavily dependent on what other units they're with."
Prismata,3d2ig4,MudkipGuy,2,Mon Jul 13 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hard counters that target a specific mechanic seem like an awkward design in a game like Prismata. I think devs are more likely to design units that are better vs freeze as ""breachproof""."
Prismata,3d2ig4,TheCabIe,3,Mon Jul 13 07:59:58 2015 UTC,"I think that mechanic would be pretty nice on a wall, just as a random side feature of the unit.  Someone suggested the idea of a ""Firewall"" before. My own personal idea of the unit has always been  Firewall 8BBRR  Prompt  Cannot be frozen  When built, put two husks into play.  4  But you know what? Chill is finally at a place in the game right now where it's strategic and not overbearing. Having one unit with this ability might be cool, but it's less of a big deal to me now than it would have been a few weeks ago."
Prismata,3d2ig4,Allroc,2,Mon Jul 13 11:23:44 2015 UTC,"Unless are your blockers are frozen, it doesn't actually do much. If I were defending with 5 shivers yetis and 2 forcefields, it actually be better for me for the forcefields to be frozen, as shiver yetis are the units you want to kill anyways."
Prismata,3d2ig4,MasN2,2,Mon Jul 13 00:47:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there are edge cases where this is useful. It's a very tiny buff and a solid mechanic. What Shiver Yeti needs is a very tiny buff.  The only problem I can see is that one player going for Shiver Yetis gives the other player incentive to do the same, and it may lead to unnecessary mirrors. I think that's a very minor concern, though."
Prismata,3d2ig4,kru5h,2,Mon Jul 13 01:08:40 2015 UTC,I would rather see this show up on defense grid type backliners which would prevent the always relevant choice to freeze the legendary high health absorb unit. A unit like that could still be relevant in games with no freeze if there is also no other backline choice.
Prismata,3d2ig4,Apooche,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't personally like the name; frozen sounds more like a unit that can't do anything due to to many chill thingys, like exaust your opponent gives you.

Prismata,3czxcb,randomflyingtaco,3,Sun Jul 12 08:28:58 2015 UTC,I think a better question is about most saved up gold leading to that being a better play than any other options(ie in Antima games you are indifferent between buy 7 engineers this turn or next).

Prismata,3cr6vx,MasN2,2,Fri Jul 10 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"G costs more than 1 gold Real doomed drone gives a value of 5 gold, not 4.(3 turns producing 1 gold, then sac for 1 health = 2 gold) You can't buy any trinities before you commit to conduit, unlike vivid and thorium which only require energy"
Prismata,3cr6vx,eX_ploit,2,Fri Jul 10 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"Will and I looked at 4 possible options for Trinity:   Remove E from its cost Increase 5hp -> 6hp Add a click ability Do nothing   I kinda like 1 but there are some problems... it might be a little p2 favouring and it's generally a bit bloaty. Opinions on this would be useful!  2 I really dislike because, even though it makes the unit better in breachproof situations, it can increase the number of situations in which it's correct to kill attackers before Trinity Drones, which can lead to really long, stalled-out games that depend a lot on supplies.  3 Seems OK, but we can't really think of a good ability. Paying HP for gold is one thing we considered, but I think 2HP for 1 gold is more reasonable. Unfortunately, it makes Trinity better in the non-breachproof situations, which feels a little bit like the opposite of what I really want to do (but still OK)."
Prismata,3cr6vx,Elyot,3,Sat Jul 11 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing. Breach-proof as a strategy only really works when you have enough stars aligned in the sky for it. If you have Trinities in the set, but not enough tools overall for breachproof, then Trinities become kinda pointless, and therefore making them better in non-breachproof situation is the same as making them not waste the slot.  Change number 2 is kinda pointless. Even though it's a strict buff, it won't actually make Trinities more interesting. They are already killed last in most situations.  Change number 1 I'm not sure about. It will certainly be more flavourful without energy in cost, because of the property of green units that you can store green and then drop a bunch of them at once. One thing though is that this change will also make it better in non-breachproof situations.  Also one more click ability I just came up with: sacrifice trinity drone, construct a trinity forcefield.(maybe make it cost some gold and green, not sure how much)"
Prismata,3cr6vx,eX_ploit,2,Sat Jul 11 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"On the subject of your last point, we actually tested a version many years ago that you could ""disassemble"" into 3 Drones by clicking it. It was a bit headachey and probably doesn't work well with modern Prismata rules, since the Drones would not be invulnerable but could also not be sacced for a turn."
Prismata,3cr6vx,Elyot,2,Sat Jul 11 02:06:59 2015 UTC,That sounds just like pixies created when you click grenademechs.
Prismata,3cr6vx,jampidampi,2,Sat Jul 11 08:41:36 2015 UTC,"Click to sacrifice Trinity Drone, construct a Gauss Cannon."
Prismata,3cr6vx,kru5h,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:33:54 2015 UTC,"With its two-turn construction time, you can regard it as costing 5 gold this turn, plus 5 gold and a green next turn.   You mean, it costs 5 gold this turn plus 3 gold next turn (from sacrificing the drones).  That's 8 gold plus inflation (a little over 9 gold by my count).  It's already strictly better than 2 drones and a conduit even if it doesn't have any click ability at all.  Including the income from Thorium Dynamo in its cost makes no sense since you don't get that income if you don't buy it.  By that logic, Dynamo somehow costs more if you increase the amount of resource it gives you."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,4,Fri Jul 10 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"Here are a couple of other ways to see it:   The thing you're comparing Dynamo to is DDC, which gives you 2G next turn. Dynamo doesn't give you 2G next turn; in fact, you're earning 5G less than you would earn next turn if you bought DDC. If you increase the amount of resources that Dynamo gives you, then the value that you have to subtract away due to its 2-turn build time also increases. Example: p2 opens Dynamo/DD. Result: Income of 11G every turn. Same as if p2 opens DD/DDC."
Prismata,3cr6vx,Elyot,2,Fri Jul 10 03:43:46 2015 UTC,"Example: p2 opens Dynamo/DD. Result: Income of 11G every turn. Same as if p2 opens DD/DDC.   Yes, except that p2 is more breach-proof this way.  This is a case where it costs the full 10 gold because p2 could have bought 2 drones, but even so the Dynamo opening is better.  If P1 opens, uhh, DD/DD/DDC vs DD/D+Dynamo/DD, here the latter opening is clearly superior since in this case the Dynamo only cost 9 gold, because P1 could not have bought 2 more drones when he bought the Dynamo.  Basically in any situation where you KNOW that you will buy DDC next turn it is strictly better to get Dynamo.  I'll grant that there is a planning cost:  you do have to know that you're buying DDC, but generally this is not a problem as in the vast majority of openings you know when you will buy a conduit and can plan 1 turn in advance.  In the rare game where you have to react carefully to what opening the other player picks then you might have to go DDC instead."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,2,Fri Jul 10 04:26:04 2015 UTC,Another example is P2: DD/DDE/DDDC is strictly worse than DD/DE+Dynamo/DD because the latter opening is 1 gold cheaper.
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,3,Fri Jul 10 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Pretend that Dynamo is exactly as it is except that it gives a million gold per turn instead of 5.  Clearly a broken unit, but bear with me.  By your logic, it costs a million gold (plus 5) to buy this unit because it takes two turns to build.  Clearly this is untrue because it's still perfectly buyable because you still just have to spend 5 gold and sacrifice 3 drones to make it."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,2,Fri Jul 10 03:50:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something seemed a bit off.  When calculating opportunity cost, you compare it to the best alternative, not a version of the unit that doesn't exist."
Prismata,3cr6vx,randomflyingtaco,2,Fri Jul 10 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"I'll bite. In your hypothetical example, the thorium would have such a huge rate of return that it would be setting the inflation rate of the entire game. The inflation rate, instead of ~128%, would be somewhere around 100,000,000%. This means that every other unit in the game would have a value of almost exactly 0.  Also, when you're accounting for the next turn's thorium cost, it's not worth 1,000,000 gold at ""today's dollars"", it's worth something on the order of 10 gold this turn, once you adjust for inflation (I don't know how much, without doing the exact calculation). Hence, the total cost of the unit would be around 15 gold or so (and by the nature of thorium setting the inflation rate, its cost will be equivalent to its value).  Finally, the economy in the game would no longer be relevant -- supplies and tempo would be. Therefore, even though the math would still work out, it would be fairly meaningless."
Prismata,3cr6vx,odomobo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"When analyzing how good a unit is, you essentially have to compute cost per unit value.  For example, Shadowfang and Vivid Drone both have extremely low cost for the attack and wealth they generate.  For Thorium, it's a matter of how you do the accounting. It's possible to either consider the buildtime 2 as ""lost value"", or ""extra cost"", or a combination of both (e.g. 3 next turn is cost, 2G next turn is subtracted from its value)."
Prismata,3cr6vx,Elyot,3,Fri Jul 10 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"The accounting should always compare vs other available options.  For every unit that has ""build time"" the amount that ""adds"" to the cost is always the opportunity cost of not having the resources spent on the cost of the unit during those turns. Like Zemora costs a lot more than just 6GG because you are essentially going without 6GG and all the returns it would have given you for 6 turns.  But it's only the cost of the unit you are going without, not what the unit would have given you had it been there."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"A most apples-to-apples comparison is Dynamo vs DDC next turn.  Both Dynamo and DDC next turn will give you 2G every turn starting in two turns.  The cost of DDC next turn is 10 gold next turn, the cost of Dynamo is 5 gold this turn and 3 gold next turn.  If I don't buy Dynamo then I can spend 5 gold this turn on something else (drones, let's say) so depending on how my spending works out it'll either end up netting me 9 or 10 gold next turn depending on whether I could have afforded 2 drones or 1 drone if I don't buy Dynamo."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,2,Fri Jul 10 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best way of seeing it.  If [dynamo + store 1] is a substitute for DD (as it is if p2 opens with a Dynamo), then it's usually equivalent.  If dynamo is bought in a situation where DD can't be a substitute, then it can gain 1 gold over other variations (e.g. p1 DD/D+dynamo)."
Prismata,3cr6vx,Elyot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree with this.  Whatever additional bonuses/penalties Dynamo gives over two drones and a conduit (breach proof, ability to convert green to gold, inability to make forcefields) is essentially free."
Prismata,3cr6vx,LastThought,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:03:50 2015 UTC,"The breach proof is often a penalty and not a free benefit though, unless you play to convert to full breach proof at some point. The reason why is that you will have less drones to hold back/convert to forcefields later, and if the set is bad for breach proof it means you must avoid getting breached. This is my biggest problem with dynamo that it doesn't make it an autobuy if I don't want a conduit or I don't want going breach proof. The cost efficiency of vivid drone compensates more for this effect while dynamo is more balanced, making it more situational."

Prismata,3clym8,mzomzo,7,Thu Jul 9 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"I have a lot to say on this subject and I'm saving it for a better constructed article I'm writing.  But in general, I really disagree with the way Lunarch views lines and player advantage as black or white, autowin or no autowin. That's not how the game plays out in reality, not with human players. Just because a line isn't a confirmed autowin after analysis doesn't mean that the advantaged player couldn't have played it differently themselves, and they're in a much better spot to do so as they're the one with the easier build to begin with."
Prismata,3clym8,Allroc,2,Thu Jul 9 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"I personally am fine if in some sets I can only win 40% of the time, and in others I can win 60%. (as long as it's randomly chosen whether I'm black or white) People blame the random set in Prismata, because there is nothing else to blame. The problem is that the units that are most likely to lead to auto-wins are front-ended units, like GMech, Drake, Scorchilla, and the Wincer. (The wincer is front-ended in the sense that you don't want to buy it right after your opponent does) To prevent auto-wins, Lunarch nerfs the front-ended units, and most front-ended units are now very weak. They still see some use, but their influence level is lower than other units, and they tend to be blanks in Base+X. Drake is a good example. At 15BBB, any game including drake but not energy matrix, defense grid, or omega splitter is a autowin for p2. At 16BBB, it isn't an autowin, but it favors p1. And at 17BBB, if it was actually on par in power with say Omega Splitter or Odin or Defense Grid, it would actually favor p2 just as much. (The reason it doesn't favor p2 now is that A. it doesn't usually get bought, and B. When it does get bought, it is usually because EMatrix is in the set)  Another solution would be to use Aetherllama's proposal.   Float2 Cost 2  Buildtime 2  At the start of your turn, gain 3 gold and sacrifice this unit.   A lower skill gate unit was proposed in a Q&A a while back   Float1 Cost 1  When you purchase Float1, construct a Float1 with buildtime 6  At the start of your turn, gain 1 gold and sacrifice this unit.   The Float1 also happens to have the property (that my be good or bad), that it changes Prismata so that it isn't about using all your gold, but using your gold well, and incentives buying WR over WET later in a red-blue mirror. The Float2 doesn't do this because the gold use isn't as granular, and as Allroc said:   The fact that it's relatively inefficient really helps cement it as a ""compensation for non-ideal tech"" unit."
Prismata,3clym8,MasN2,3,Thu Jul 9 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Would love to hear your thoughts!  The article was getting a little long, so I didn't really speak much on the points you raise, but I totally know where you're coming from and was thinking about some of those points myself while writing the article.  We do consider alternate lines of play for both players in autowin situations. For example, a major part of the analysis of Feral + Grimbotch concerns what happens if p2 skips the first Feral. Similarly, our analysis always considers what happens if p2 delays the first Symbiote and slips in a TT turn when going Symbiote + Protoplasm. A true refutation must achieve equality regardless of what the opponent does. Chess players know what I'm talking about.  That said, I think asymmetry in ""ease of play"" is indeed a legit concern, in the same sense that some chess positions can be a theoretical draw but will be a win for white 95% of the time because the defense for black is too difficult for a human to find. ""Ease of play"" asymmetry often manifests itself as winrates that get closer to 50% as Elo increases; we see this with some units like Iso Kronus, which is slightly p2-favouring in general but neutral at 1700+ levels.  Of course, we avoid all types of imbalance where we can, but we also think it's healthy if some optimal plays are ""hard"" for human players. Going forward, a lot of the skill ceiling in Prismata will come in the form of play that aims to neutralize perceived advantages. We want Prismata to have plays that are hard for players to find in game, because we want advanced players to continue having things to learn, even after they hit a rating of 2100. We don't want the difference between a 2100 and a 2300 to simply be ""the 2300 is better at calculation and reading tons and tons of moves ahead"". We think it's a good thing if knowledge/wisdom matters too.  That said, I think it's unrealistic to expect that every single Prismata set offers equal opportunities to both players to employ really high-level knowledge to gain an advantage in the opening. But if you come across sets where you think the disparity is so large that it's objectionable, definitely let us know.  We've actually considered running secret experiments where we quietly give the same random set to multiple players and, considering the results over multiple random sets, try to parameter-fit to a model of the form ""each random set has p1 winrate randomly drawn from a normal distribution with mean u and std sigma"". It's not even obvious to me what values of sigma would be considered acceptable!"
Prismata,3clym8,Elyot,3,Thu Jul 9 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the really detailed reply, Elyot. I just think there is a big problem on the user experience end when the odds feel so heavily stacked against a player before the game even begins.  Most of the fun in Prismata, at least for me, comes in neutral sets where there's a lot of back and forth. Play and counterplay. You have to think about what your opponent did every turn, not just know it 5+ turns in advance. Those kinds of games can and do exist in Prismata, but they're much too rare in it's current state.  To use a Chess analogy as you did, no one would play just the endgame of Chess, where everything is easily predicted and the outcome is all but determined. The interesting parts are the openings and midgame, where you have to react to everything your opponent does.  I can point to quite a few unit designs, unit combinations and core game mechanics that promote these kinds of unfair sets. That's where my article plans to pick up on, but I've been struggling with the issue of solutions, because this is a complicated problem that demands a complicated solution. mzo expressed interest in publishing it on Prismata Frontline, so I hope to have it up in the next week or so."

Not only do chess players find the endgame difficult and interesting, but also beautiful; there is an entire genre of composed endgame studies that explore various themes. In fact, this usually occupies a few hours of my week.  Analogies notwithstanding, I agree with Allroc that it's discouraging when I'm in a set that seems to have an obvious strong line of play for the other guy, but I have to struggle a lot to think of anything plausible. Hopefully I get better at playing those sets at a ""disadvantage"" but in the meantime it's slightly frustrating.

Also about 2 months ago, Wortel, Adamiedidia and I did a ton (I did over 100 games) of playtesting on BSO, there is even a reddit post about it. That reddit post seems to invalidate your last paragraph because there are only 2 main lines: p1 going for blue/green counterplay or going into the tarsier mirror. We analysed both and p2 seems to win in all variations right now except the blue/green rush that is not explored in enough detail yet, though p2 seems to be favoured. The meta became stale and no new variations were posted ever since the p2 path was published, I think mostly because the GM set was removed from queue options so there was no more motivation for players to study those lines. I am still obsessed with base set and I feel that p2 is favoured in all variations, but there is a chance we missed some lines, especially in the green/blue counter line.

It wouldn't feel right to me to just complain and not put forward an solution, or at least an idea. You can do that when it comes to unit balance, but this is a very different subject. A comprehensive solution probably involves a lot of small tweaks instead of a single bandaid, though many have tried, such as Aetherllama's unit idea mentioned here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Prismata/comments/34hbpd/unit_suggestion_that_would_mitigate_player/"
Prismata,3clym8,Allroc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:20:03 2015 UTC,"it is important to consider the implications when an opening that isn't necessarily an auto-win is still the best move    in a game about having very limited time to make moves, that might as well be the same thing    it seems the devs end up applying some version of this logic, albeit inconsistently, with nerfs to units that are perceived as too strong even if they aren't    i'm still unsure about the whole approach. without lots of ways to end in a draw, it's impossible to make an asymmetrical game of perfect information that's balanced.    they can mask which side has the auto-win with enough complexity, but i'm not sure that's needed. the timelimits should be more than enough to make sure that almost all games end up with someone making a mistake instead of forcing the draw"
Prismata,3clym8,the_biz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"I was going to write something longer, but I realized that everything I was saying was just repeating the same thing: I would much prefer if the skill in the game comes from analyzing the random units and deciding which technology to develop and how one might respond to opposing plans than having memorized specific openings.  I see all sorts of discussions about possible refutation lines that involve cutting drones in the first few turns, which certainly should be an option, but it means that the discreteness of the economy becomes more of an issue.  At the expense of making the game nearly unplayable without a software client (it basically already is), I would support multiplying all gold values by 10 (or 5 or 4 or whatever) to help with the discreteness problem, allowing for greater tweaking of unit costs and the ability to even add small gold costs to some click abilities to help balance them.  I'm not sure whether you've tried scaling the gold by various factors or whether you just have your heart set on drones making 1 gold, but by providing more granularity to costs and income it would encourage a more economic approach.  The granularity would also help things with the idea of a pie rule or auction system where one player would start with more gold based on player preferences to play each side."
Prismata,3clym8,EyeUrn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"My point wasn't necessarily that people should have to memorize openings. In fact, I've been a long-time fan of people never having to memorize anything to play Prismata.  I just think that it's acceptable if some openings require tricky, hard-to-find builds through intuition and analysis.  A guy like Aetherllama can deduce that his equity improves if he grabs a Conduit and gets Endotherm Kit as p2 in a Flame Animus/Shadowfang set. And I think that's a good thing. If every unit and opening was super balanced through extremely granular pricing, then there wouldn't be as many rough corners to exploit as a strong player. IMO those rough corners are important because they make some choices better than others.  We thought about doubling all costs before. While it might allow us to make some small changes (4.5R for a Shiver Yeti), we always felt that it would hurt more users than it would help, because balance at that fine of a level is only really needed at ultra-high levels, and we can hopefully satisfy high-level players with some kind of drafting/auction/veto system instead."
Prismata,3cmqgx,solforge123,2,Thu Jul 9 02:48:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on the set, but against DD/DDC/DDB/DDXeno, a good response is simply DD/DDE/DDD/DDDB/DDCW if you can get away with a high econ build.  Sometimes DD/DD/DCB/DXeno can be OK as p1, but I think it's usually a trap unless you have something good to do with the blue and green afterwards. In Xeno games, you want a big economy."
Prismata,3cmqgx,Elyot,3,Thu Jul 9 07:05:21 2015 UTC,Usually the correct response to DDE is followup DDE/DDDC/DDDB/...  Player two is still probably a little bit ahead in most sets but I think the engineer line does even it out a lot.  Edit: http://play.prismata.net/?r=rJUxN-yYss0  Here is a replay showing a good p1 open when you want red stuff after xeno.
Prismata,3cmqgx,Apooche,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that as P2, P2 DD/DDE/DDDC/DDDB is better in xeno sets when P1 opens DD/DDE  Thanks for the replay code - this is what I was looking for - thanks.  I'm not sure, but it looks like your blastforge #2 was better than P2's conduit #2.  (P2 couldn't afford a blastforge on the turn he bought conduit #2 and Xeno). Also possible P2 buying 2 drones and an engineer on 7 was at least partially wrong and if he could have bought one more attacker, he might have won."

We did do a quick round of optimization of some major bottlenecks, but there is a lot more we can and will do.  The performance problem might be at flash/browser though. Which browser are you using?

Prismata,3cfze2,apetresc,5,Tue Jul 7 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"This is something that I have actually talked about with other members of the dev team while making the AI.  The short answer is that it would be really cool to do this, and it is very possible that it could exist in the future, but for right now it's a really low priority in terms of getting the game out of beta / completing features. Also, with the game currently in beta the formats for everything may constantly be changing so keeping the API up to date behind the scenes would probably be a hassle.  I've organized and run the Starcraft AI Competition for the past 5 years so I'm no stranger to APIs and running this sort of tournament, and it requires a LOT of work on the API developers to keep it bug free. Also one issue is that releasing an API to make bots may have the adverse effect of flooding the human ladder with bot players which is something we really haven't come up with a solid policy on whether we want to allow yet.  So the real answer is ""not yet"" :)"
Prismata,3cfze2,serendib,2,Tue Jul 7 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"On the last part about bots flooding the human ladder: it is something that happens in games with grinding where you can get to rank x by just playing a lot of games and having winstreaks. Prismata is no such game (though the climb to tier x may be achievable like that), since it is ELO based. I doubt that bots on ladder will ever be a problem, based on the branching factor alone and that a bot grinding would still never make it to the leaderboard."
Prismata,3cfze2,Steel_hs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:52:37 2015 UTC,This is the reason it's hard to determine whether or not they would be a problem without observing the effects
Prismata,3cfze2,serendib,3,Tue Jul 7 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Whether or not bots would be effective at ladder-climbing, providing an API does not make it any easier for malicious people to bot the ladder, since presumably clients connecting through the API would not be allowed to ladder.  Sure, people can reverse-engineer the native protocol or just use some sort of UI manipulation to do it, but that isn't affected one way or the other by the existence of an API."
Prismata,3cfze2,serendib,3,Tue Jul 7 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"An API wouldn't directly make it easier to play on the ladder, but it would make it much easier to actually make a bot. The easier it is to make a bot, the more likely they are to be on the ladder.  Either way, this isn't the major issue. The major issue is time and resources. Creating the API just isn't as big a priority right now. As an academic interested in game AI tournaments however, I would love to see one in the future and would probably have a hand in its creation once the game is full-featured and the in-game AI is 'finished'"
Prismata,3cfze2,jrkirby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:40:46 2015 UTC,Definitely see your point on the priorities and resources :) I really hope Prismata keeps growing so you guys can get to this sort of thing some day!
Prismata,3cfze2,Sgeo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"You could construct the API in such a way that anybody using it would have to follow special bot rules to play on the ladder. If the easiest way to make a bot has the bots telling you that they're bots, well you can shut them out of ladder whenever you deem that it hurts the community.  On the other hand, if a fan hacked together his own bot, it would probably be indistinguishable from a real player to your server, and if he ran a bunch of instances of it to judge it's performance or troll or something, it really could fill up the ladder."
Prismata,3cfze2,jrkirby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:27:48 2015 UTC,"What if someone good with making Prismata AIs makes an API-based bot, and someone good at hacking things together but not at Prismata AI takes that bot and modifies it to connect without the API?"
Prismata,3cfze2,TrickBlimp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:05:53 2015 UTC,"Plausible, but I find that unlikely. What's the point of hacking together tools to make a bot when the devs already made a bot API? Also it might be almost as much work to reimplement the bot as it was to make it in the first place, depending on circumstances."

Prismata,3cfze2,Elyot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this exact thing for the past few days, but I know I don't have enough time to write a bot.  One huge issue with the devs opening a bot API is when they release a new unit with a new mechanic. Writing a bot that can simply parse all the different unit types would be a pretty big challenge.  What could be a cool idea would be a community-created bot-only server, and interface protocol. If we created this, it could be useful to create a ""basic mode"" which limits special mechanics available, so it would be easy/possible to get a bot up and running, and to be sure it's bug-free.  An idea for basic mode: no units which produce/consume other units, no sniping units, no lifespan, no freeze, no frontline, no spells.  One problem with this idea is the only way to watch replays of what the bot is doing, is by entering the commands directly into the prismata client.  To the devs: would a community-created bot server be an issue? Would we be infringing on your IP or anything?"
Prismata,3cfze2,jrkirby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"To the devs: would a community-created bot server be an issue? Would we be infringing on your IP or anything?   IANAL but my guess is that it would be infringing if the same API is used, there is some legal precedent. (Really interesting case that's worth reading to anyone who hasn't!)  Of course we'd never come after anybody for running a bot tourney, but in theory we'd probably have some legal grounds to try to if we really wanted."
Prismata,3cfze2,Auxeras,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"If there were an API, I would definitely write a bot. I would enjoy it a lot. That said, I understand why it isn't a high priority to the devs."

Prismata,3cfze2,serendib,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"I would be so down for a bot tournament, I think that would be the coolest thing ever. I'd be surprised if there was anything the devs could do to make writing a prismata bot any easier than it already is, but using a packet analyzer it should be possible to build a half-decent framework for doing this so that if we were to have a tournament there wouldn't be so high of a barrier to entry. It's technically against ToS but as long as no one does anything malicious I think it shouldn't be too big a deal."

It definitely can be made quite easy. I'm thinking of some sort of protocol like UCI or GTP.
Prismata,3cfze2,serendib,3,Tue Jul 7 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"A very user-friendly API could be made to interact with the game's AI system through JavaScript. Since the AI currently is written in C++ and compiled to JavaScript, functions could be exposed to allow an interface to the internal engine (in the form of getLegalMoves() and doMove()) with relevant data structures / functions for getting state and action information. With this API even someone with basic JavaScript knowledge would be able to make a bot fairly quickly.  The main issue isn't whether or not it's possible, it's the time it would take to create and maintain the API."
Prismata,3cfze2,MudkipGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:44 2015 UTC,How are you compiling c++ to js? With asm.js? Also you shouldn't care too much about user-friendliness of the API if it comes at the cost of forcing the developers to use Javascript.

We don't want to put content behind a paywall... like if you REALLY want a particular skin then you can get it if you grind enough. But unlocking all the skins without paying would be like unlocking all the champs without paying in League."
Prismata,3cevtv,Elyot,3,Tue Jul 7 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that, but I personally spent no money on league and have unlocked most (missing like, 10 that I just don't want to play) champs not paying a dime. Also, champions are much more important/necessary to enjoy LoL, unlike skins. That's my main point of concern, there's tonnes of people that just don't care about cosmetics enough to buy them, but there's tonnes of people that would buy them if they had to.   Now don't get me wrong, I don't want you to put up a paywall, as a consumer I'd much rather have everything unlockable. But from a observing/company standpoint, if you can't earn enough money from these unlockable cosmetics, prismata WILL die, so the thought of that just makes me sad :("
Prismata,3cevtv,Crash_overlord,2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"I think that the trick to making money with a free-to-play model is that generally, even if most people spend nothing or very little, a small percentage spend a ton. I would support having real money for special benefits, like custom avatars, or a dota 2 style compendium (when Prismata is big enough) but I agree with Elyot that all skins should be unlockable through grinding. Even if you won't pay anything, lots of people will."
Prismata,3cevtv,Al2718x,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that the game won't be big enough to have enough of those big spenders. Prismata isn't backed by a company the size of valve, so they can't afford to be as ""fair"" as valve is imho. Locking cosmetics behind a paywall is in my opinion completely moral and fine, they literally do not add anything to the gameplay.  Again, I'm not saying prismata won't make enough money, I'm saying I'm afraid it won't."
Prismata,3cevtv,Crash_overlord,3,Tue Jul 7 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"I'm still pretty sure adding a paywall will just annoy people. Besides, with the inclusion of sets of skins, people will be willing to spend some cash to get that final skin anyway. Honestly, I think that the free to play model is pretty good for now.  Edit: Also, if Prismata isn't successful, I don't think that paid cosmetics will save it."

Prismata,3cevtv,Steel_hs,2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:31 2015 UTC,"I particularly liked that you were the first who said that math is not hard in this game. Mzomzo asked all players so far about maths implying it is hard, but thing is that it is only hard if you are new to the game or maybe in super fast time controls. The strategy/tactics aspect is what makes the game hard, not the combat math which adds to the skill gap but is not hard to learn. What makes math hard sometimes is tradeoffs (not talking about obvious exploits and basic micro etc): sometimes it is a tough choice whether to attack but sacrifice defence or to hold the attacker back, lose frostbite to breach or not, attack to kill dmg but allow a breach in return etc. But tradeoffs are tactical, pure combat maths is just adding 1+1."
Prismata,3cevtv,Steel_hs,2,Tue Jul 7 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"When I talk about math I don´t just mean easy combat math for 1 turn, it´s for several turns. It´s also calculating you and your opponents ressources some turns ahead, and that can be really hard if you don´t use analyze mode."
Prismata,3cevtv,Steel_hs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"You are right, it is important to clarify what one means by maths. The whole game can be boiled down to it from a certain point of view, but there is an ""easy part"" (which is still hard for some people) and a ""hard part"". And yeah, short term or long term, chill or without chill and so on. The questions by mzozmo in this regard were general and in my interpretation were aimed towards combat maths and how fast one can calculate it. There are people who count fast and people who count slow, but it is not this that makes the big skill difference between players (thanks God the game is deeper than that). I just wanted to make it clear to not confuse those people who just started playing Prismata."

Today i watched this game live and I hope you will enjoy it ;)  Edit : The actual system of watching live games is pretty cool but insufficient since sometimes you get to watch the mid-game and you are wondering about the players openings and with replays you would be insured not to miss the best games played."

Prismata,3c5u88,UselessSource,18,Sun Jul 5 02:38:08 2015 UTC,"I can talk about the funding stuff, no reason not to be up front about it.  Funding is tricky to explain. We have no publisher funding us, just a bit of cash from friends and family (plus Kickstarter from last December). Devs like me/Will/Alex/David basically work for little to no money; our work is compensated through stock options. In fact, we've all put money into the game, i.e. invested our own cash into it... so it's like a negative salary almost. As you might expect, this causes us to not burn cash that fast. We can keep going for a long time. I pretty much intend to keep working on the game for as long as we can (and my personal financial situation allows me to do so).  On the other hand, stuff like art/sound and our hired programmers and interns do eat up the company budget pretty fast. If we had unlimited resources, I certainly could find room for a few more people on the team. We earn a small amount of revenue from the supporter packs, but it's peanuts compared to the weekly salaries of our full-time staff.  (I'm hoping though that things will improve a bit once we have a real-money store in the game)  Of course, the moment we put Prismata on Steam Early Access, we'd start earning quite a bit of revenue. But it will really cripple our success if the game isn't ready when it gets on there (i.e. has bad art or doesn't have proper tutorial/onboarding/retention features).  This makes some decisions tricky from a growth/strategy point of view. I talked to one of the guys who did Grim Dawn and he mentioned that they such a huge amount of success from going on Steam Early Access that they actually were able to hire more devs. But it's a huge risk/reward issue.  That said, there are other sources of funding. For example...   Government grants... quite a few good ones in Ontario, especially to pay for marketing. Publishers... (but ew... their terms would have to be ridiculously good for us to be interested in taking money from them for development/production, because we care a lot about retaining control of the IP and the product vision. That said, we might consider publishers as partners for marketing/PR.) More private investing. Not something we're doing right now, but private corporations like Lunarch Studios are legally allowed to sell company stock to friends/family and accredited investors. I unfortunately can't say much more; there are solicitation laws governing what I can and cannot legally disclose publicly about our intentions regarding investment. We could even run a 2nd Kickstarter, as many games have. That said, I really don't feel that it sends a great message if features from the first Kickstater are still not complete. And it's a TON of work. I'd rather wait until we have something new to offer up (e.g. a Kickstarter for an expansion, or something new like ""raids mode"".)   We're not worried too much about the player base size right now; it's actually the perfect size for us to get good feedback without being overwhelmed. I do kinda wish there were more lower-level players, but we need more casual-friendly features to keep them around, or our efforts will be mostly wasted. Once we have more features in the game, we'll throw more resources at growth."

Most of the missions just introduce 1-3 new units and are about using those units well.  The missions feel more like ""scenarios"" with objectives and weird constraints, like low supplies or expensive drones or the requirement to defend for a certain number of turns. Some are almost like chess puzzles (you have a bunch of attackers and pixies and freeze, win in 2 turns). Some are the complete opposite and feel like a 1v1 game against the bot."
Prismata,3c6hqj,Elyot,3,Sun Jul 5 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"Drawing a comparison to starcraft -- the campaigns of Broodwar and Starcraft II are actually structured very differently. Broodwar is much more a preparation for the game itself. If you beat it, you have to be at least passable at the game. If you're 'good' at the game, you can easily beat every level by massing whatever unit you feel like (in most matchups), because you know how to macro.  In Starcraft II, every mission is like its own little game, and you hardly have to expand. In one you have to hijack trains, in one you have to gather resources, in one you have to micro battlecruisers and so on. Beating the campaign teaches you very little about the real game.  I can see why the second model may be preferable for casuals, although you could argue that it cheapens the value of actually beating the campaign. The current tutorial in Prismata is a rather decent preparation for the game... what direction will your campaign go into?  I'm also very curious about how good the story will be... will it be a generic good vs evil plot with a predictable happy end like HotS, or an amazing multifaceted masterpiece like broodwar? I guess only time will tell."

Prismata,3c3q43,TheIdiotNinja,0,Sat Jul 4 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER : I've been away from prismata for a lot of time, I still do some games once in a while but I'm nowhere near as active as I was a while ago.  Frost Brooder is a unit I both hated and liked at the same time when I played actively, it's very interesting and a well timed brooder can really be what changes the game. This is what I like about the unit: the possibility to enhance a player's great timing choices while being just a waste of resources when it's not timed properly, and I really think this is what the unit should be. A way to reward players who make good timing choices and resource management as well. So after thinking about it a bit I thought about remodeling into an unit that can really give a well orchestrated red opening the edge when used correctly: Frost Brooder 2RRR, 2 Health, 1 Supply, no lifespan, buildtime 4 At the start of your turn, generate one Frostbite for every three tarsiers you have, and generate a Frostbite for your enemy for every drone you have past the 20th.  This makes so that you have to force two Animuses into your build and basicly commit to that and that only, because going for anything past maybe an additional Blastforge to help with walls will generate Frostbites for your enemy. This is designed to give midlow econ, red centered economies a bonus tool to win match ups against anything that isn't breach proof if they can fit the double animus into their build. The timing of this unit also has to be very precise, preferrably synced up with when your 6th or 9th Tarsier hits the board, and when used properly it's a devastating 9 chill every turn that easily wins games if not stopped in time. The brooder player has to constantly dance around his Tarsier timings and his forcedly restricted econ, while his enemy has to put enough pressure down to prevent the opponent from building double animus and enough tarsiers - and possibly if he uses Red to do that he can consider a brooder too to win the game. Of course numbers need some fixing, 20 drones might be too many or the exact opposite, same for 2 gold cost and 3 tarsiers. But I think it's a good concept to start balancing around, rather then ""hey this thing pumps out frostbites!"""

Prismata,3c42z2,solforge123,3,Sat Jul 4 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'll give the question a go. Note that a lot of assumptions hav to be made: I assume both players are aware this is what is being tested and are building accordingly, and focusing on economy until the Tarsier player prepares to attack. I'm not entirely sure what the difference in Drone count will be from turn to turn... I did a little testing and I think that it's maybe about 13% lead. So I'll assume that's how many extra Drones the Wall player has (since they're reactive, they'll be the one to have more). Also, if my testing was accurate they'll have somewhere around 28% as many Engineers as Drones.   I'm also assuming Wall player isn't using his Engineers. I might try and factor that in later...  Both players have built some arbitrary but large amount of drones (D for the Tarsier player who makes the first move, and 1.13D for the Wall player) and engineers (E), and nothing else. We'll assume the amount built is large enough that being left with small amounts of money from turn to turn is negligible, and so talking about fractions of the number of Drones is a reasonable approximation, without having to worry about exactly how much money is left over. Similarly, we'll ignore the absorb on the walls, since it becomes increasingly irrelevant as the number of drones increases.  From here, player Tarsier stops buiding economy completely, and spends 80% of her gold on Animus and the rest on Drones. This means she has 2D/15 Animus, and 16D/15 Drones - and will be making 4D/15 Tarsiers per turn.  As soon as this happens, player Wall is going to respond by building some Blastforges. Well, actually, that isn't true. First, he's going to build economy for one more turn, since Tarsiers have buildtime 2. He doesn't switch into full Blastforge, and instead builds as many Blastforges as he needs per turn to keep counteracting the Tarsiers build built by player Tarsier, and from the turn after this, builds as many walls as needed to take all the damage - and still build the same number of blastforges, each turn, every turn. The question then is quite simple - is the number of new drones he builds every turn greater or smaller than the extra amount he has to dedicate to building walls?  The first turn, he builds Drones. He has 1.13D and so about 0.32D of Engineers. This means he can build 0.32D this turn, taking him up to 1.45D. He has 0.17D worth of unspent economy this turn. Now the numbers here get (even more) fuzzy but I think the optimal use of this is to invest 0.09D into getting 0.045D of Engineers, leaving 0.085D of money.  Turn 2, he needs to build Blastforges. How many? One Blastforge makes one Wall, which blocks 3 Tarsiers. 4D/15 Tarsiers are being built per turn, so he needs 4D/45 Blastforges each turn. That will cost 4D/9 of his money (or about 0.44D out of his 1.54D). His remaining money, 1.10D is going to be invested into more Drones. Since he invested in a few more Engineers, he can build 0.365D here, and has no money left over. Since I would prefer to keep numbers to 2 DP here I'm going to call it 0.37D (don't worry, it doesn't affect the final result). Now he has 1.82D per turn, but spends 0.44D on Blastforges every turn so has an effective income remaining of 1.38D  Turn 3 is of course where all hell starts breaking loose. Now player Wall is facing an increasing attack of 0.13D per turn. Fortunately, since we already know he spends 0.44D on Blastforges each turn and Walls have the same cost (in G) as Blastforges, it's also easy enough to work out that he spends 0.44D on walls this turn, and has to increase his wall spending by 0.44D each turn. At this point it seems clear that Walls aren't going to keep up - he's only increasing his economy at MOST by 0.37D each turn, and that amount will drop rapidly as more economy is diverted to walls. So anyway, turn 3, he has 1.38D to spend (after subtracting Blastforges), 0.44D of that goes to Walls so he has 0.94D left. That's another 0.31D of Drones.  From here, the picture gets a little bleaker every turn for Wall player. He's increased his economy by 0.31D Drones, but he has to spend a further 0.44D on Walls, meaning he only has 0.81D left this turn - about 0.27D more. The turn after that, he only has 0.64D spare so gets a further 0.21D of Drones. Turn 6 he has 0.41D to spare so only gets about 0.14D Drones. Turn 7 only 0.11D to spare - at this point he might do better not even getting more Drones, and just investing more into walls. Even if that prevents a turn 8 Breach, it's not going to last, I doubt it'll last through turns 9 and 10, at which point his economy is going to get gutted very quickly.  So, phew, that was long. No doubt there's some errors in here, and I realise it's not formatted as nicely as it could be, but hopefully people can follow what's going on. But perhaps, this has shown it's a fair bit closer than you might have imagined. If I'm calculating this right, if Wall player's economy was only about 10% bigger, they would have been able to boom their economy fast enough to pump out walls, drones and blastforges fast enough that the Tarsier player couldn't get through, ever. Or if he had some other source of economic growth - perhaps Vivid Drones or the like? Maybe he could survive then.  Now I mentioned I didn't factor in blocking with Engineers. I believe that blocking with Engineers is a losing move for Mr. Wall. This is because to survive, he needs to be building more new drones per turn than he has to invest in building walls - and you can only build one drone per Engineer. Since he already doesn't have enough Engineers to do that, well, clearly losing more isn't helpful. Then again, maybe since he can pump out some extra engineers without getting Blastforges, there's some ratio he could use that gets him a little further. I doubt he could do enough to win, though - without a better economy unit than basic drones, at least.  TL;DR: Attack too strong, Tarsiers win, but it's closer than you probably expected."
Prismata,3c42z2,Tables61,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:48:31 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I think this is pretty close to how I now feel after reading everyone else's comments and doing some of my own math.   I got 14% bigger for the wall Econ to 'win'.
Prismata,3c42z2,randomflyingtaco,2,Sat Jul 4 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Similar to amalloy's build. I went with DD DDE DDD DDA DATT TTTT TTTT... Which looks the same for the wall player. You need to have 28 drones on the turn where you build the first blastforge to keep up with the +7 drones per turn of growth in addition to the resources needed for defense. The best I can get is 18 leaving walls far behind. If walls had another turn he still wouldn't be ready but if he had 2 more turns he could outgrow the damage progression.  This is not based on approximations of the value of energy, red, and blue but rather on a specific progression. Perhaps there is a different build for the attacker that causes him to win by even more  but if the defender can't beat a specific build there is no way he can beat a reactive build."
Prismata,3c42z2,MudkipGuy,2,Sun Jul 5 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"If there's infinite supply, then for any starting number of drones and engineers for player A, there exists a starting number of drones and engineers for player B such that player B can defend against anything player A builds without building attackers (or even forcefields or walls).  However if the starting position is the normal prismata starting position then the player building tarsiers wins."
Prismata,3c42z2,kops,2,Sun Jul 5 09:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think the actual answer to this is best posed as follows:  A machine which builds a wall costs 15EEEEE and has a 1 turn delay (the ""machine"" is actually 5 drones which build a blast forge next turn and a wall every turn after that).  On the other hand, a machine that kills a wall costs 12RRR on a 1.5 turn delay (in the form of 3 tarsiers). One R is slightly cheaper to get than a gold, since you can get RR per turn for 6 but it takes 6EE to get 2 gold per turn. Thus the tarsiers cost a bit less than 15 gold equivalent in total.  Thus, the machine which kills a wall costs a bit less than the machine which builds a wall but has an extra .5 turn delay. I'm actually not sure which one wins, but either way is very close.  Note that the logic in the current top comment by /u/amalloy is completely faulty and assumes poor lines of play by both players. edit: not the top comment anymore"
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,2,Sun Jul 5 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"Interest rates and unit costs don't really matter, because in the long term attack is a renewable resource and defense is expendable: tarsiers will overwhelm the walls, and it's not even close. Here is the reasoning (not rigorous enough to be called a proof).  First, suppose we have both built up our economies ""enough"" and just want to build tarsiers and walls forever. I'll give you a head start here: you got your economy up to 100 walls per turn, and I can only build one tarsier per turn. For the first 300 turns, you will be building up a very stalwart defense, with lots of walls left over, but after that I will have enough tarsiers to hold even with your wall production, and then enough to start chewing through the backlog. Numerically, after N turns, the total amount of health you have produced is 300N, and the total amount of attack I have produced is 1+2+3+...N = N2 - N/2. Over a long enough time period, that quadratic N2 will outpace any linear N, no matter how big a lead you start with.  So let's avoid that scenario and say you never stop droning, so that you can build more walls every turn than the turn before. How much does that cost you? You need 5 more drones for the additional blastforge, and 5 more drones for the additional wall: 10 extra drones per turn to keep this up is quite expensive, but not impossible. So, you need a 30-drone buffer before you can even start building walls in this plan, but at least you avoid the certain doom that we proved in the first paragraph if you ever stop droning.  How much do I need to spend to keep up with that? I just need to buy 3 tarsiers per turn to break even, or 4 to eventually outrace you. I don't even need to keep droning to win against your ever-growing economy: I can just build 16 drones and 2 animuses and then spam tarsiers forever, like DD DD DDA DDA DDTT TTTT TTTT.  So, by turn 6, I am already building enough to tear down the stuff that you need 30 drones and 10 engineers to build. You can't get there nearly fast enough, and if you could you'd still be losing in the long term. Again numerically, you will have built 3+6+9+...3N defense after N turns, but the total amount of attack I have thrown at you will be 4+8+12+...4N. It only took me 16 drones and 2 engineers, where you need 30 drones and 10 engineers."
Prismata,3c42z2,MasN2,2,Sat Jul 4 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"You do not need 5 drones for a blastforge. You do not have to rebuild the blastforge every turn. 5 drones and 1 blastforge cancel out 3 tarsiers, and since tarsiers are delayed by 1.5 turns, drones actually win if not for energy. Keep in mind engis can also block. Once you factor in absorb, I can safely say W>T in low econ."
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,0,Sat Jul 4 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Wrong. Remember, this is in the scenario where you are building more walls every turn than you did the previous turn, since it was trivially easy to prove that if you build the same number of walls every turn you lose. Since you are building one more wall than last turn, you need one more blastforge than last turn."
Prismata,3c42z2,MasN2,2,Sat Jul 4 19:20:13 2015 UTC,You need to build 1 more blastforge per 3 tarsiers. You do not need to build 1 more blastforge per turn per 3 tarsiers.

I can't even tell you why you are wrong because what you are saying makes no sense. Try building only walls against someone who is up to 14 damage by turn 10, or 54 damage by turn 20. Do you really think you can scale up to 18 walls per turn by then?"
Prismata,3c42z2,MasN2,3,Sat Jul 4 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Your arguments are completely disconnected from the scenario you are arguing about. I can't even tell you why you are wrong because what you are saying makes no sense.   Uhh, I don't have a counter arguement to that ""Arguement""   Try building only walls against someone who is up to 14 damage by turn 10, or 54 damage by turn 20. Do you really think you can scale up to 18 walls per turn by then?   Quite possibly, if I've been droning the whole time. If I've been defending 14 damage by t10, you have not been buying enough econ to get to 54 tarsiers by 20."
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,0,Sat Jul 4 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I have. With no supply limits, 16 drones is enough to do all that, with exactly the build I included. For your convenience I calculated the damage on turns 10+20. An opponent who doesn't have to defend can build attack VERY quickly on unlimited tarsiers."
Prismata,3c42z2,MasN2,3,Sat Jul 4 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"I'll decided to actually simulate it.  EDZXt-0yXKJ  I had to cut it short due to supply, but you can see that the wall player actually gets drones super fast. On the later turns I forgot the rule about having to block with a drone per wild drone bought, but it would be a nightmare to resimulate it since my incognito mode is mysteriously disabled and ie is loading sketchily slow.  Around turn 10, this is how it goes:  Player 2 has 12 tarsiers attacking. Player 1 defends, then buys up to 44 (the replay shows 46, but I broke the wild drone rule) drones. Player 2 now has 16 tarsiers attacking.  Later, player 1 needs to buy a second blastforge to keep up, but notice how you can use the engineers that are producing energy to get more efficient defense than walls up to a certain point.  Tarsiers might eventually win, but certainly not:   tarsiers will overwhelm the walls, and it's not even close.   I am sure that if player 2 starts with A TT TD TT ... then player 1 will win, as the 2 wall absorb will decide the game.  A higher econ route like yours could put the tarsiers at an advantage."
Prismata,3c42z2,toble007,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:07:54 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is infinite walls couldn't win v infinite tarsier.   Without using calculus, calculate to 16 drones of econ for tarsier player and econ to that point to wall player. In about 3-4 turns can the wall player out econ 4 damage a turn at that point knowing they need to make >=8 drone a turn if you make 4 engineers. You can't use walls because defending with 1 wall + 1 engineer + 1 blastforge means 12 drones a turn.  I'm not 100% sure on my calculations, but am pretty sure on my result because how far away it seems for the wall player to snowball out of control with econ."
Prismata,3c42z2,nicht-trivial,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"Actually building engineers instead of walls seems more efficient as I need 20 gold to get a wall every turn and only 18 gold to get 3 engineers every turn. So now we can compare tarsiers and engineers directly, for each tarsier built by my opponent I need to build one engineer every turn, i.e. I need 6EE every turn (cost of 2 drones) for every 4A my opponent can put into building tarsiers (every turn). I assume its not possible to outrun the opponent in a way that I have 50% more economy with just walls/engineers."
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,2,Sat Jul 4 21:18:43 2015 UTC,"I thought this at first, but it's not quite true. If you have unlimited time, walls are more efficient than engineers. The extra 5 gold you need up front for the blastforge pays for itself after 5 turns of spending $5 instead of $6 for 3 defense, and after that you're able to get 3 health for $5 indefinitely."
Prismata,3c42z2,nicht-trivial,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"No. Either you buy 6 drones, that produce 3 engis every turn or you get 5 drones and one blastforge which gives you one wall every turn. 6 drones are cheaper, that's why buying only engis is more efficient. (minus a first blastforge, and one wall per turn for absorb)"
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,3,Sun Jul 5 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"Wellll, it's not quite so clear as that, because the engineers aren't prompt. If you get the walls instead, you can spend one more turn building up drones before you buy the walls. But you're right, the simplistic answer I gave is definitely wrong."
Prismata,3c42z2,odomobo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"I decided to change the question to ""how much would a (non-absorbing) wall need to cost for its value to be equal to a tarsier""?  The answer I came up with is: roughly 4.1B.  I used some super simplified conditions:   you can buy fractional amounts of units, per turn a drone costs 3 gold, and no energy p2 starts with ~15% more drones than p1 a tarsier costs 5 gold   Condition #2 seems a bit shaky, but basically both players are buying a fixed number of drones each turn, so there's no need to buy more engineers.  Then I solved for: how much would a husk need to cost, in gold, so the defender can exactly keep up with the attacker.  Let's say p1 starts with 5 drones, and builds a tarsier each turn. P2's actions are as follows:  p2t1: build all drones. p2t2: 1 husk, and x drones p2t3: 2 husks, and x drones p2t4: 3 husks, and x drones ...  X will be the the cost of a husk, in gold. That is, you have to grow your economy enough so you can build another husk each turn. When you solve for x, it is roughly 1.917."
Prismata,3c42z2,NaevaTheCat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:42:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sure you know what infinity is. Could be wrong but I don't think inf - inf is well posed.   If on turn 1 I buy an infinite number of walls they never die. You can kill eighty baggillion of them and you're still as far away from killing them all as if you killed one.
Prismata,3c42z2,suddoman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my question is unclear.  You have an unlimited supply (as opposed to 10). You still need the money to buy them. You start with 6 or 7 drones (no walls) and play out the game. Alternatively, if you want to avoid infinities, you could think of the question as would the game go long enough for me to buy my thousandth/millionth/billionth wall or will I get breached?"
Prismata,3c42z2,suddoman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:34:22 2015 UTC,Do you have standard limit on everything else is basically the question. And I believe the answer is yes.
Prismata,3c42z2,amalloy,2,Sat Jul 4 16:40:00 2015 UTC,Unlimited drones animi engineers and blastforges
Prismata,3c42z2,jamesa7171,2,Sat Jul 4 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting idea. I would want to say Tarsers, their structure is cheaper per unit produced (6 for 2 v 5 for 1), Tarisars are also cheaper (4g v 5g). The wall player will also lose his investment over time.  So no matter what the Tarser Player can sit on his heels and build drone count until the Wall player makes the first move. Even if you talk about Tarsiers rushing their unit they would eventually overwhelm their opponent."
Prismata,3c42z2,Steel_hs,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"Indeed infinity is not a number, so you can't just do that subtraction. But some problems, including this one, are well enough defined to deal with the infinities: if you had infinite walls and I had infinite tarsiers, at the end of my turn all your walls would be gone.   The basic proof of this is: number your walls and my tarsiers each as 1,2,3...for each wall, I can tell you exactly which three of my tarsiers destroyed it. Therefore, there cannot exist any wall which was not destroyed.  Now, of course OP actually just meant unlimited supply and unlimited time, which is a different thing indeed. I think red overwhelms blue quite quickly in this scenario as well, but I don't have a proof of that."

The basic proof of this is: number your walls and my tarsiers each as 1,2,3...   This assumes you can count walls and tarsiers in a fashion like 1, 2, 3...  The real numbers, for example, are uncountable. If I had one wall for every real number, and you had one tarsier for every integer, I would still have walls left over at the end of your turn."
Prismata,3c42z2,Newbore,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:24:40 2015 UTC,"You are right that if there was infinite walls and tarsiers on the board, walls would win. The bottlenect is economy here, you cannot get infinite walls before you start getting breached."
Prismata,3c42z2,kops,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. Defender assigns damage so I'll only assign your damage to my even numbered walls, letting the odd ones survive. Now I still have infinity walls after your damage and I can renumber them and repeat this process every turn. I win.   Edit to add: I'm mainly posting this to illustrate the flaw in your argument, not as a serious argument itself. In reality you can't really subtract infinity like this in a defined way. In the context of prismata, the defender actually would win by my strategy above, but they'd have to be allowed to define a function from tarsiers to walls in order to do so."
Prismata,3c42z2,Steel_hs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"/u/amalloy did the math. Attack is renewable, health is not, only up to 2 health can be renewed no matter how many walls you have. If both players keep building then eventually the attack overwhelms the defense.  A more literal angle... Google defines infinite as ""limitless or endless""; if infinite is never-ending then you can't run out of it, so infinite tarsiers cannot kill infinite walls because there is a never-ending amount of walls.    If every turn i build 1 tarsier & you build 1 wall, then it takes 3 tarsiers (5 turns) before i break-even with your gain. Every round your 5th wall will be put up & destroyed again. After 3 more turns (8th turn) i will be able to break 2 walls each turn. After 3 turns (11th round) you will only have 2 walls, & I will be able to break 3 each turn, so i will breach your walls with 3 damage to spare.   If you build Z amount of walls each round & I build 1 tarsier, then i will break even after 3Z rounds, +1 round (if you start) & + 2 rounds (for the countdown) [3Z + 3]. To breach your walls it takes twice that amount of time, +1 round. The equation should be 2(3Z+3)+1. Might be easier to use as 6Z + 7. I hope my math is right.  So if you build 4 walls each round & you start, then at the rate of 1 tarsier per round, it will take me 2(3*4+3)+1 or 31 turns to breach your walls.    4 walls = 2(3*4+3)+1 = 31 rounds 3 walls = 2(3*3+3)+1 = 25 rounds 100 walls = 607 rounds 7000 walls = 42,007 rounds"
Prismata,3c42z2,Steel_hs,3,Sat Jul 4 23:40:52 2015 UTC,You're assuming the wall player isn't growing his economy. This is a faulty assumption.
Prismata,3c42z2,MasN2,0,Sun Jul 5 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"It is pretty obvious that even with infinite supply you will lose if you only build walls. You will not have the economy to keep replacing them and the attack will keep growing. You don't only need to buy a new wall to every 2 tarsiers/turn, you also have to replace lost walls and engineers, and that is why you lose."
Prismata,3c424l,DontBe_Tamad,3,Sat Jul 4 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"6 Engineers and you didn't use them at all after the 4th Vivid while your enemy kept droning with just 4 while building 2 Tarsiers per turn.  Then you went for double Animus with nothing but Tarsiers effectively wasting resources as soon as you had the 10th and got triple Blastforge for the Defense grid wasting even more until you got pushed to the point where you started building 3 Walls every single turn causing you to run out of supply right away.  Lastly you tried to salvage your excess R with unsynched Scorchillas which are pretty much more expensive Tarsiers in value. You could have started a massive Rhino-train instead which would have resulted in free G for Gauss Charges, Forcefields or something and alleviated the amount of pressure you were under. I don't think it really mattered anymore at that point though.  tl;dr: your transitions were very janky and you wasted R and B  disclaimer: I'm a scrub; the hell do I know?"
Prismata,3c424l,n00bdax,3,Sat Jul 4 16:15:53 2015 UTC,Your opening is ineffective. Skipping a drone on turn 2 to get an engineer just puts you a gold behind. Getting the 6th engi just to get the 4th vivid a turn earlier is worse than just getting 2 drones and then the vivid later.  You overtech. Double animus on 20 econ is sketchy when you also aim to get a defence grid (and therefore triple blastforge). If you want to double animus you need to either drone harder and get possible get the grid before the animusses or skip the grid in favor of 2 rectifiers and then defend with appropriately timed rhinos. But even then I wouldn't get double animus in this set since you can only get tarsiers and rhinos with it.  Scoorchillas are really ineffective attackers unless you combo them with something (like endo + scorches) or go mono synced scorches to deny absorb.

Prismata,3c1cuu,wbmc,6,Fri Jul 3 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Created this just to comment on it. First off I want to say that I greatly appreciate a post like this, even though it's a few days late for most people. Secondly, it seems like you haven't looked into scrolls at all. Therefor I will give some of my opinions on the game, having played it for a few days, and being a big scrolls fan.  Just like scrolls, this game isn't pay to win. Even more, just like scrolls, you cannot pay for anything but cosmetics. That afaik as of now (or near future) includes avatars (just a picture, not an avatar with body parts like in scrolls), skins and emotes you can use in-game, Hearthstone like. This indeed means that there is no in-game chat, although you can access general chat from within a match.  The fact that you cannot buy things that affect the game is simply because of the fact that there are no things that influence the game before it starts. There are no decks, there's no progression except from becoming more skilled. All you can earn are cosmetics. The way this game makes every match different is by a set of random units. Instead of cards you have access to a (limited) list of units, some of which are set, and some of which are randomized for each game (there being about 100 units as of now I believe). The exception to this is that you can choose 5 units before you go into arena, those units will be less likely to show up.  Units are different from scrolls (and from HS as well for example). Some give passive attack, some have conditional attack (like paying X resources or sacrificing certain other units), and of course there are units that just give resources, or summon other units.   Combat is very different from scrolls. Instead of positioning you as a defender get to choose how to distribute the incoming damage. There are 3 types of units, units that just block (like walls), units that never block and units the block as long as you don't use their ability that turn (like attacking for example). What that means is that as long as there's not enough attack to kill all blockers the defender chooses which ones will die and which ones won't (at the beginning of his turn). However, if more attack is coming in than there is health on the blockers the attacker gets to choose which other units he wants to take down, this often results in taking out your opponents economy, or low health attackers. Another aspect is that most units fully heal up at the beginning of their turn, which means that you can adsorb a lot of the incoming damage if you plan ahead.  That planning ahead is of course possible, really necessary even in this game. In Prismata there is no surprise damage; when you start your turn you know exactly how much damage your opponent can do next turn, and can adjust your defenses accordingly.  Because of this and the fact that both players have the same units to use there's no advantage going into the game except for first turn which is handled really interesting because the first player has, well, first turn and 2nd players starts of by getting more resources every turn. This makes it so that the outcome really is determined by who is the better tactician (strategist, what ever would be appropriate here, probably both). The game is easy to understand and get into, but has a long learning curve(which is a good thing).  I haven't really looked into it yet, but there are frequent livestreams, there seem to be tournaments, reddit is fairly active and every I've met in-game was nice.  In short:   Deeply strategical and tactical gameplay. No deck building. No shiny gold thrown at you after you win a game. No rng (during matches that is, except for 1st turn advantage or disadvantage, depending on the units). ""Positioning"" is very different from scrolls, and something you just have to try to get an idea how it feels. Good community (don't know how it compares to something as great scrolls, but it's not like toxic or anything as far as I can see)."
Prismata,3c1cuu,mzomzo,2,Fri Jul 3 22:21:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this and commenting all your thoughts! I was hoping some long term scrolls players would offer their commentary and that's exactly what you did, so awesome!  I actually bought into Scrolls when it was alpha and played it for a few months until around the time when decay first arrived, but to be fair I could be misremembering things. Can you help a brotha out and let me know some specific bullet point changes? I would like to make sure the information is accurate! I edited the part about pay to win to say grinding instead as you don't pay for the in-game gold with cash. I'll take a look over my points again as well just to make sure. I literally posted that right before bed so...you know ;)  Also on your point about the first turn advantage. Agree with what you said except to note that because the game is so deterministic, there are often actual strategies that work better as P1 or P2 and you start to see lots of decisions based on that without other playing having a specific advantage. The biggest example being P2 being able to get Conduit (the Green resource) earlier which will influence your build order. It tends to add a lot to the game instead of making RNG your enemy!"

Prismata,3c1cuu,Crash_overlord,2,Sat Jul 4 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"Nice post overall, I'm still very new to Prismata (and Oh! Hi wbmc :D) but I just wanna say that while I understand the comparison and I'm sure that almost every Scroll player can enjoy Prismata as well (myself included) they are really different games. Scrolls is a TCG that brings a lot of tactics adding a board while Prismata is a strategy game that brings some elements of card games in the sense that it doesn't have a board and the feeling is kind of MTG thing but it's still different from that as well. I mean Prismata could have figures like in chess instead of cards because there's no decks and there's no information that needs to be hidden from the players (like the next card draw, etc.).  So while Scrolls is TCG with board, Prismata is a stretegy game without board but the resource management is highly emphasized and that's where almost all the strategy comes from. Making more drones to have more powerful things at the end? Invest in walls? Trying to make an aggressive attack and the make drones? There are a lot of decisions and there's different types of resources that gives you access to different types of units, ones are more aggressive the others are more powerful but expensive, etc.  I'm sure a lot of Scrolls player will enjoy this game, Myself was playing Scrolls because it was one of the most (if not the most) strategic TCG out there (and not only for the board but also for the sacrificing mechanic) and Prismata is a strategy game but resources are important as well as knowing how to adapt to the situation (because of the random poll of cards there is in every game). So my list of things that share both games would be like something like this:   Both games has strategic elements but again, Prismata is a strategy game and Scrolls is a TCG. The resource management is important in both games but I would say it's more important in Prismata and there're more decisions to make in this matter.   And things that are different:   There's no deck builder in Prismata since it's a strategy game and not a TCG. There's no elements of luck in Prismata (first turn advantage happens to every turn based game except if the turns are simultaneously I guess) but there're RNG elements. In every game there's a pool of cards that is random but there's no luck because booth players has the same and you can see all of theme. Prismata combat kind of remember the classic combat in TCGs like MTG but it has a lot more elements in play and we have to remember that Scrolls combat wasn't similar to the classic TCG like MTG or Hearthstone.   So overall Prismata remembers more StarCraft than Scrolls tbh but I like it (well I play Scrolls and StarCraft so… what can I say… xD) it's a very deep strategy game and I know Scrolls players love that so yeah it's a good game to give it a try but if you're looking for a real TCG this game possibly will not give you that experience (if you're coming only for Scrolls) except if the part of TCG that likes you is the combat system here you have a lot better and deeper system.  Well I think that's all I wanna say… hope it makes sense!"
Prismata,3c1cuu,Steel_hs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:22:13 2015 UTC,"I would agree, Prismata is much closer to something like turn based starcraft or a ""modern""/videogamey verison of chess. It's only similarity to most card games is just that it uses cards for the units.  I do feel that anyone that likes games that require strategical decision making and improving at it will absolutely love Prismata. People that are mostly deck builders or enjoy playing their ""flavour"" and don't much care for skill might not enjoy it as much."

Prismata,3c0gpk,turnipsapiens,3,Fri Jul 3 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"The only useful units in this set are hellhound and maybe ebb turbine. Gauss Fab is too slow and conduit is useless in this set, the set isn't high econ enough for double animus so corpus is useless, and with the highest absorber being a wall, getting the first Arka is bad."
Prismata,3c0gpk,Msven,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:31:05 2015 UTC,why is first arka bad?
Prismata,3c0gpk,SageEatingSage,2,Fri Jul 3 18:58:01 2015 UTC,your enemie should counter arka and denie your absorb value from buying a promt arka and he gets full value!
Prismata,3c0gpk,Paranoijaa,2,Fri Jul 3 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"First Arka can be decent in this set but only if the opponent doesn't have 2 blasts and an animus. If you get Arka first, and assuming you have exactly 7 damage (the best time to buy arka) then that Arka will cost you 5 damage because 2 would get absorbed on wall. If your opponent sets up properly to get a second Arka half a turn later, then the opponent's Arka only costs him 1 damage, because 6 of it would be absorbed on the first Arka."
Prismata,3c0gpk,Msven,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:22:15 2015 UTC,"Since this will be a hellhound mirror, both players will have 2 blastforges and an animus to threaten arka so noone will buy it early. If the game lasts for long enough then it may be bought around 14 dmg. The interesting choice is whether or not to rush ebb turbine as p1 by going dd dB. Is it better than dde?"
Prismata,3c0gpk,Steel_hs,2,Sat Jul 4 07:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ebb and hellhound synergize quite well with a Blue-Red baseset. Let's you pump out tarsiers and get a wall, then transition into hellhounds to get effective damage."

Prismata,3byagy,eX_ploit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Actually now that I've analyzed the set a little bit more I think that, as Synx says, first Centrifuge is too strong, especially due to synergy between Tesla coil and Electrovore, so the right play is to either be the one who builds first Centrifuge, or skip it altogether and try to punish Centrifuge player by going something like   DD DD DDC DDB C(Tesla) D(Tesla)"
Prismata,3byagy,Steel_hs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:30:32 2015 UTC,If there is no big prompt absorber in the set then going for centrifuge half a turn later is bad. You should instead play to punish the centrifuge. I think you lost immediately after you bought the 2nd fuge in this game.
Prismata,3byagy,Synxisback2k,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:40:46 2015 UTC,"there are many mistakes in the opening. First centrifuge is huge here as there is no big prompt absorber. Usually this means p1 should cut a drone turn 2 and open with turn 1 dd, turn 2 de and turn 3 centrifuge. Other than that there is way too much tech being added on from both players before the fuge pops. The natural transition here should be mid econ with about 20 drones tops. I might prefer single teslacoil from fuge and getting the 2nd one later. Then buying the red attackers, absorbing on walls and defending with aegis and grimbotches that time out. Getting the double mahar and trying to go for a bigger economy was also an option, but u kinda need the green for teslas and aegises, also the red stuff is just way more costefficient for attack than mahars so I would probably not get mahars."

Prismata,3burp7,Sixsmith216,5,Thu Jul 2 09:08:28 2015 UTC,"I've noticed something odd when watching my replays in real time. The time at which the replay shows me doing an action is actually the time at which I really performed the subsequent action. To explain what I mean more fully, I played a test game where I performed the following actions on the first 3 turns, at the following amount of seconds into the turn:  Turn 1: 1s: Build drone, 2s: Build drone, 3s: Spacebar, 10s: Spacebar. Turn 2: 1s: Build drone, 2s: Build drone, 9s: Spacebar, 10s: Spacebar. Turn 3: 1s: Build drone, 8s: Build drone, 9s: Spacebar, 10s: Spacebar.  When watching the replay of this in real time, the following actions were shown to be performed at the following amount of seconds into each turn:  Turn 1: 2s: Build drone, 3s: Build drone, 10s: End turn. Turn 2: 2s: Build drone, 9s: Build drone, 10s: End turn. Turn 3: 8s: Build drone, 9s: Build drone, 10s: End turn.  This is obviously quite a minor thing, but it can be a bit odd, in particular when replays are cast during masters league streams. For instance, in the example, the turn two behavior is quite representative of me playing normally. Let's say it's obvious that I should just go DD, so I do that straight away, but then I use 10s of my time to think about the random set before hitting double spacebar. However, for people watching a replay, it looks like I'm taking ages to decide whether to get the second drone, which makes me look a bit special :P It also makes things look weird when the timebank is empty, and I buy everything I want to in the first half of my time for a turn before using the rest of the time to think things over before hitting double space. To the replay viewer, it looks like I only just remembered to spend my last resources in the nick of time before my time ran out, whereas in reality I was totally in control - again, it makes me look like a crazier player!  I don't know whether this applies to watching live games too (or even what my opponent does in my own games), since that's a little harder for me to test by myself, but I think it'd be nice if this issue could be fixed, if possible, unless there's a good reason why it works like this?"

Prismata,3burp7,4Robato,3,Mon Jul 13 15:03:27 2015 UTC,Hi!  I'm very new to this game. Just got the key with the Scrolls thing and so far I'm enjoying it. I couldn't play that much this days but I just wanted to share some feedback of my first impressions. When I started playing the tutorials for the first time I was kind of confused on what was going on with the turn. You have to double tap to pass the turn but in the first tap you see how everything is destroyed and that confused me I wasn't sure if it was my turn or what was happening. When I get use to it then it's fine and useful but I think it would be nice to have a more visual effect when you pass the turn and when it's your turn so new players understands more what is happening.  And well that's maybe just me but I didn't found how the hell I quit in the middle of the game xD Now I know but my head told me that the menu button (that circle thing) it was just for settings and stuff and I just didn't though about clicking it while in game :P  This is just my first impressions and not everyone will feel the same way just wanted to share that :)  I'll keep playing! Tbh it's kind of addicting this game xD

Prismata,3burp7,Auxeras,2,Tue Jul 14 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Can you maybe tweak the gold-for-next-turn annotation a bit? I get why it's currently the way it is - it always shows the maximum amount you can possibly have, just like the damage annotation, and you want to keep things consistent. But it's just so... ugh, annoying to do maths over and over in each turn with dynamo, especially if you try multiple lines.  My suggestion would be: don't include click abilities at all. That way, you don't have to add intelligence to a system which is supposed to be dumb, you just make it dumb in another, less irritating way. The other units this would affect are Auride Core and Zemora.  I'd even argue that it makes more sense this way. The damage annotation always displays the maximum amount of possible damage for your opponent, so that you're always safe if you defend for that much. Consequently, shouldn't your resource annotation always display the minimum amount of possible gold, so that you're always safe if you plan ahead with that number? Well, unless you lose drones."
Prismata,3burp7,MasN2,2,Sat Jul 18 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that change would result in less frustrating situations.  Not that you can't mess up with it, but it definitely feels easier to mentally add the gold produced by click abilities rather than having to subtract it for those you can't afford.

You should have a skin if you go to humble bundle and use the same email as the one you used for paypal.  If you need any additional help please email support@lunarchstudios.com
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"I believe it's been a month since I asked this, what's the progress on the android version?"
Prismata,3burp7,Lenor4ever,4,Sun Jul 5 08:36:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's still more of a thing they might do in the future, but they're not actively working on it right now. I think they want to finish the games main features first before they start porting to mobile."
Prismata,3burp7,etotheipi1,3,Sun Jul 5 09:50:57 2015 UTC,"Probably the same answer you got from me a month ago... we have a version, it works, but the UI is pretty awful and it's really slow. Not really something we can release without substantial work, and we don't have time to put in that work just yet (but we hopefully will in the future)."
Prismata,3burp7,Lenor4ever,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:08:39 2015 UTC,How about releasing it as is as a downloadable apk and label it as test or something similar?
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,3,Wed Jul 8 12:14:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could release a working apk in a day (maybe little more if I want to build in updater), but it will be incredibly slow, and some UI stuff will be really annoying (tab switching between base set/random set, chat, etc.). If there is a big demand, I could sneak this in after we finish arena reward stuff this week."
Prismata,3burp7,Lenor4ever,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:37 2015 UTC,I'm fine with something rough. I don't want to rob too much time from the regular development. Just a flash player that runs the exact same version would be good enough I think.  Thanks for considering it.
Prismata,3burp7,Asymat,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Calling /u/etotheipi1...  One issue is that it will likely break with updates. But we could probably try something, might give us some useful feedback."
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:20:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, however it works/doesn't. Way better than the alternative."
Prismata,3burp7,shift-f,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:09 2015 UTC,"I have to +1 this. Please Lunark, just make a ""watch-only"" Android version."
Prismata,3burp7,lacampane11a,3,Mon Jul 6 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is not really any easier than a version you could actually play on."
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,2,Tue Jul 7 11:09:18 2015 UTC,"If you have'nt tried it, give Puffin browser a go - it has build-in flash support, and despite having a really lame small tablet, it loads the game quite fine for me (performance much better than in chrome/ win7 on my notebook...).  In theory, I could even use it to play, but handling units is really awkward without a stylus... But for watching a game while having breakfast, it does wonders."
Prismata,3burp7,Kirian42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:58:47 2015 UTC,Are there any further plans to optimize the graphics' performance?
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,3,Mon Jul 6 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yep. Board assets are much faster, but there is still a lot of needless slowdown in the lobby and with a lot of the animations. We'll get to it soon!"
Prismata,3burp7,serendib,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:07:26 2015 UTC,"AI vs. Zemora. (Master Bot, 3s)  I don't think this is a bug per se, but the AI sucks when playing Zemora sets.  In particular, the AI doesn't buy the Conduits needed to make the Zemora actually work... it usually just sits there.  While it's a small investment, the AI would have done better to just buy a Gauss Cannon.  It's a minor thing but it's happened enough times that I notice it."
Prismata,3burp7,Fridaytime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll get /u/serendib to take a look."
Prismata,3burp7,Elyot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"We're aware of this, it's just a little tweak we can put in later to say buy more conduits when Zemora is owned. We are trying to avoid these sort of little rules for now since cards are constantly being re-balanced. We can add those to improve the bot once all the units reach a more stable state"
Prismata,3burp7,SirGaribaldi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:37 2015 UTC,2 quick things:  First did you anounce somewhere that you can mute people in global chat?  Secondly you gotta put the Dynamo change into the changelog.

Prismata,3bsaar,solforge123,3,Wed Jul 1 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Other people are presumably better with each of them than me but here are my initial thoughts:  Thorium Dyanmo feels like it could be the strongest unit in prismata right now. I may be doing something wrong but I think it is a strong unit even if it had 1HP instead of 10(unlike trinity which is less cost effective than drones). I imagine the only time this unit isn't good is if vivid is in play but even then it is probably still good.  Borehole patroller seems like a so-so attackers/burster.  I imagine there are some sets where it is very strong but I haven't figured them out yet- in other sets it seems much stronger than gauss cannon/steelsplitter but slightly less efficient than tarsiers(and when you add in the fact it attacks/blocks it is presumably on average a better unit).  Tantalum Ray feels like a good unit whether you are going breachproof and only clicking it twice, or clicking it all 4 times. I don't think its overpowered or anything but definitely a strong unit that will be purchased in the vast majority of its games"
Prismata,3bsaar,MikeMcDonald89,2,Wed Jul 1 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"Regarding Thorium... yeah it's pretty good. Vivid/Doomed can be a bit better in practice but it depends on a lot of other things. It was originally 5EE, which held it back a lot compared to what it is now, but we found it to be a bit too p2-favouring so we went with the stronger, rampier 5E cost.  I'm worried that its HP might have to come down a tiny bit because I've seen it NOT get targeted first after a breach in too many situations, and those endgames tend to be unfun (we want econ units to generally die first).  Any word on whether the unit is too good to the point of hurting diversity or being unfun? Very interested in people's opinion on this..."
Prismata,3bsaar,Elyot,2,Thu Jul 2 02:13:05 2015 UTC,I've seen it NOT targeted first   I've found that the person who doesn't target the Thorium first generally loses. It reminds me of the replay where both players shot at the other player's cannons and isos instead of the trinities.
Prismata,3bsaar,MasN2,3,Thu Jul 2 02:50:45 2015 UTC,Guass Cannons are definitely kill last. Always.
Prismata,3bsaar,Chronopolize,3,Thu Jul 2 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, 6hp Tantulums...."
Prismata,3bsaar,MasN2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"ther the unit is too good to the point of hurting diversity or being unfun? Very interested in people's opinion on this...   I don't like Thorium - I think it makes (the majority of) games take too long and ultimately come down to who doesn't run out of walls. This is my opinion and I will add it to my veto list, but I dislike it as much as I disliked frostbite a few days ago."
Prismata,3bsaar,StealthNL,2,Fri Jul 3 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't got a clue, but it happens to be that I saw an article concerning three new green guys (probably the ones you're after!) on that site posted to the front page of this subreddit!"
Prismata,3bsaar,Sixsmith216,2,Wed Jul 1 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, here's the link for those interested."
Prismata,3bso1a,Al2718x,6,Wed Jul 1 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's not a breachproof unit, so much as a unit that helps prevent you from being breached."
Prismata,3bso1a,Sixsmith216,3,Wed Jul 1 20:57:33 2015 UTC,"I believe the idea is this: You build them vs. freeze. So, you're overdefending like you have to against freeze. But unlike stacking Xenos vs. damage, where you're losing damage on defense, your opponent doesn't actually get to make you lose them."
Prismata,3bso1a,FlakManiak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yes true, but this isn't breachproof because you still aren't letting the opponent breach. In fact you are doing the opposite."
Prismata,3bso1a,Elyot,3,Wed Jul 1 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"It's not particularly good at being breachproof, but it's good at defending against burst like Drake or freeze."
