BostonTerrier,3e49fy,Feef12503,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"I can't say that my little guy has stopped growing, but by estimation Axton should be done in terms of his weight and build. He is 5 months and seems to have slowed down on how much he is gaining now. I think though that smaller breed dogs tend to stop growing at a younger age than larger dogs (who stop around a year) so your guy shouldn't grow too much more I would guess! That is so sad to hear about what he is going through and I hope the best for you and him! :)"
BostonTerrier,3e49fy,Jaeludra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:44 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think getting his cart when he's 9 months should be ok then. He's 8 months now so we don't have to wait too much longer.
BostonTerrier,3e49fy,tehoose,2,Tue Jul 21 21:39:07 2015 UTC,"I think ours hit max size before a year, but she's on the smaller side anyway.  In any case, he's so lucky to have owners that care as much as you do. Thank you for taking care of that pup! He seems very sweet."
BostonTerrier,3e49fy,tehoose,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:02 2015 UTC,He's on the small side too. He's 8 lbs at 8 months so I imagine he will probably reach full size earlier than some.

BostonTerrier,3dqhh8,missitipsy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"I used to have a dog (Staffordshire bull terrier) that did exactly the same. If you moved any of the stones she'd 'arranged' on the river bank, she'd move them back to their original position. We just found it a bit funny at the time - just a quirky behaviour!"
BostonTerrier,3dqhh8,southernbeau33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:27:49 2015 UTC,Our guy does something similar. He will take our clothes or blankets and pull them into his bed and stack them up. But he also does love rocks and will carry them around when we are outside and keep one with him. I think it's just one of the many hilarious things the breed does!
BostonTerrier,3dqhh8,Jaeludra,0,Tue Jul 21 21:11:43 2015 UTC,"Terriers were originally bred to detect small rodents under the ground, dig them up, and present them. So this may just be an instinctual behavior."
BostonTerrier,3dqhh8,Ranger5052,4,Sat Jul 18 18:20:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to question you on this but where did you read that? The Boston was actually bred just for the sake of a new breed. It was classified as a Non-Sporting breed and there's even a snippet of the AKC stating, ""I can find no reason for it's creation."" Later saying, ""I cannot find that the Boston ever had a purpose.""  I hear all sort of ideas why Boston's were bred; that they were middleweight fighting dogs, that they were toys, or ratters as you state. My family has kept Boston's for 4 generations now. My Uncle is very keen on the lineage. The best we have figured is that Boston's were bred for the novelty.   For whatever the reason, I'm just happy they are here!"
BostonTerrier,3dqhh8,MazdaSpeed13,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"Bostons were bred to be bred! People loved the temperament and intelligence the white english terrier (now extinct),  but the dog had many many health problems (too much inbreeding most likely). So in order to ""keep the breed alive"" they crossbred the dog with a stocky english bulldog mix and Judge was born. He is the ancestor of almost all the true modern Boston Terriers."

BostonTerrier,3doz2n,vousaimezmike,4,Sat Jul 18 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"Bostons are pretty weird when it comes to night patterns, there's a spectrum from normal to weird that they may cycle through every so often.  Quite honestly I think yours has a ""master"" mentality thing going on at the moment, as it's not that unusual for pack animals such as dogs to watch over each other as they sleep. He may just be checking up on y'all due to wanting to make sure everything's a-okay with his alphas.   If this is something else, he may sense something is wrong. Have either of you been having nightmares lately? Or have the potential for sleep apnea or excessive snoring? Your dog may feel obligated to see how things are going if he's a bit concerned."
BostonTerrier,3doz2n,psyblurmist0623,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:58 2015 UTC,Huh..that is really interesting. My husband definitely snores a lot..and loud and I suspect sleep apnea cause he will wake me up gasping for air. Maybe I snore as well since pup was staring at me this morning   Edit: it can also be the alpha thing too now that I think of it. He has been outwardly defiant to both of us (not following commands and running away from mom last week when I took him off leash)
BostonTerrier,3doz2n,psyblurmist0623,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what to say about your edit or if it has anything to do with him watching over you guys, but I do just want to get in that I my pup likes to sleep under the covers with me and if she ever feels me turn over or anything she'll sit up and stare for a bit.   At this point I have a hunch that you guys may be making ""noise"" (to him at least) during the night and he's just watching to see what's going on."
BostonTerrier,3doz2n,Shiny_Serenity01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"My Boston watches me too.  I think she assumes I can read her mind and is waiting for me to do what she wants.  I wake up in the middle of the night, turn around and see her sitting near my head watching me.  That is her way of saying she wants to get under the covers so I have to lift them up for her.

Our last Boston was also lazy and played with the cat and they were fine.   This lady on the other hand is super high energy and from the off wanted to get up in her face and play in a way that, to the cat, was threatening. Took us two weeks to get the cat to understand the dog wasn't trying to attack her, and we're still trying to get the dog to play less in a way that's inappropriate for a 25lb dog vs an 8lb cat.  Chances are by the time we get them both 100% in the clear with each other someone will adopt the dog. Murphy's law."

My boston will actually become worse if I get frustrated with her - positivity is a better motivator - but I also never let her get her way."
BostonTerrier,3de26e,jaimmie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:22:22 2015 UTC,"from my experience, ""hyper and jumpy"" is pretty standard for Boston Terriers. You can definitely train her though. My Boston is hyper and jumpy, but listens very well. My puggle on the other hand is a real bitch. lol"
BostonTerrier,3de26e,DonShetland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:11 2015 UTC,Definitely trainable.  Some dogs are treat motivated and some are more toy motivated too.  I have one boston of each.  I think toy motivated bostons are fairly common.
BostonTerrier,3de26e,sambatrader,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has already said, Yes! What I would recommend is make sure you establish yourself as the Alpha. Be decisive, stern, and confident. When you are indecisive, flaky, and insecure they can sense it and will take advantable of it. I have spent times with dogs that the owners said the were crazy hyper and mis-behaved, but when I spent time doing very basic behavior and training skills, they acted completely different. Good luck!"
BostonTerrier,3dbmpy,WhiteTrashKlebitch,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Biting is not cool-- try using the alpha hold when you are watching TV or sitting for a while. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHLFofsL4cw  The dog will try to bite, squirm then stop, etc.  Only release the dog from the hold when it submits.  We've always had bostons and this always worked if they misbehaved.  Be real calm about it.  The guy in the video kindof does it, but my guess is your boston will be harder, head in the inside of your elbow."

BostonTerrier,3dbmpy,mrkantz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:21:50 2015 UTC,He probably knows you are afraid of him and is asserting dominance over you. He doesn't know any better and it's you and your families job to teach him boundaries. What is you and your families reaction when he does this?
BostonTerrier,3dbmpy,mrkantz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"I act completely normal around him. Come to think of it he does this shit to my mom too and bothers her constantly whenever she eats, and whe put him in his cage when he gets like that."
BostonTerrier,3dbmpy,the_choking_hazard,2,Wed Jul 15 03:50:00 2015 UTC,Well I made mistake of looking at your post history and its clear you have a very unnerving disposition for this dog. I honestly have a hard time believing how much of this is true and how much is fabrication due to your childish hyperbole in previous posts about him. Dogs are a lot of work and it's on you to teach them to behave and coexist with your family. He is only acting as he's been taught to.

If she doesn't want to play ""throw,"" she'll bring the ball back and grunt but where we have to actually get up and go to her so we can't just pick up the ball if she drops it. She wants you to WIN the ball. She wants to wrassle. You need to get lightning quick at snatching that ball and get some tug ropes."

BostonTerrier,3cuzj4,yetanotherdivorce,2,Sat Jul 11 01:12:25 2015 UTC,"I concur here. They're not the best vets overall, but if you get a puppy, their wellness plan for that first year (about $360, broken down monthly), covers neutering/spaying and all their shots, as well as unlimited vet visits. It can help with the questions and concerns. Being nationwide (in almost every Petsmart) helps as well getting medical care on the road."

Owning a dog is like bringing a furry child into your life. You can't just give them away. You can, but it is your responsibility as a parent now to take care of you fur baby.   Also, don't underestimate how in love you will fall with this dog. My love for my dog frightens me to have children.

He is the most hilarious, and well behaved dog I've ever had. His previous owner didn't disclose some health issues he had, but they were easy enough to fix (although expensive).   I would absolutely recommend a boston terrier as a first pet, at least from the standpoint of getting an adult dog. I can't give much insight into how they are as puppies, but you can do some research.   He rarely barks, doesn't shed much, is great at home by himself, loves everyone and everything he meets. He really is insanely easy to take care of. Be prepared for a lot of energy though, but easy enough to exercise."

BostonTerrier,3cpid0,TheAssPunisher,8,Thu Jul 9 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"stop feeding treats altogether. just get beyond this need/urge. you don't need to replace fatty dentabones with peas and think you're doing right. just cut out treats period. no human food or dog treat of any kind. buy good quality food at a good petstore. ask for their advice considering weight issues. spend the money for quality kibble.  give the proper amount of food for the ideal weight - not their current weight. increase exercise. if he can only walk, double the walk time or walk twice as frequently. if he plays, play more.   if your dog is very hot the best way to keep them warm is to get them wet and trying to avoid too much direct sun exposure. sunny day? he's panting heavy? feel his back and ears... are they hot? get to shade. get him wet.  i'm sorry to be direct but this isn't rocket science. 10 lbs for a boston terrier is an significant amount of weight. if they're a large boston that's like 25% obese. if they're small, it's more like 60%.   weigh yourself on a scale and do the math to see how big you'd be. you'll be surprised."
BostonTerrier,3cpid0,jfjjfjff,3,Thu Jul 9 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"You and your family are doing a great thing by taking the vet's advice seriously and trying to make a change.  An overweight dog will die younger and have a greatly diminished quality of life while they're still around. Your dog can't make decisions about how he eats, so your family and neighbor have to take responsibility for the effect their choices have on him. Luckily, it is a lot easier to get a dog to lose weight than a human for the same reason.  The best advice on exactly how to get your pup to shed some pounds will come from a vet, but there really isn't anything complicated about it.   First, find out how many calories your dog should be eating to lose weight at a safe, gradual pace.   Second, figure out how much dog food that is, and make it easy to measure by getting a scoop that's the same size as a single meal.   Third, agree to a feeding schedule with everyone who feeds the dog. For example, my bostons each get a half cup of food three times a day.  Finally, stick to the feeding schedule. Make it a routine and it becomes easy. Sticking to the feeding schedule also means cutting treats out - with the possible exception of rewards during training, which only need to be a tiny nibble of food. Human food should be strictly off limits.  You should look forward to seeing the other changes in your dog that will come with losing weight. He'll probably be more playful and energetic, have a much easier time on walks, and be happier in general."
BostonTerrier,3cpid0,wurzle,3,Fri Jul 10 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"This advice is all based on kind of nonsense.  The actual thing to do to get your dog to lose weight are correct diet and lots of exercise.  Correct diet does NOT mean any people food--that often triggers allergies and inflammation and sometimes worse things.  Get the dog on a high protein grain free food and feed only the amount recommended for the weight he SHOULD be, not the weight he is. Most BTs should be under 20 lbs so no more than a cup per day at the absolute most.  For treats, go with grain free meat treats like Real Jerky treats.  Keep him away from grains, feed him proper servings, and you'll see a big change."

BostonTerrier,3coqx4,SatanicHispanic42,2,Thu Jul 9 15:41:27 2015 UTC,We had the same issue when we did the blood work for ours before he got neutered and it didn't seem to be anything to worry about at the time. We just monitored it annually.
BostonTerrier,3coqx4,mikeyas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Thank you. Is it something that gets better with age? They said he's only 6 points over (whatever that means) but they wanna check again in a month to make sure it's not going up.
BostonTerrier,3coqx4,mikeyas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"Ours ended up having other health issues (unrelated) that also ended up affected the liver/kidney so I can't say but I do recall the vet saying the elevated BUN enyzme (if that's the same as what yours was) could also be related to dehydration and a number of other things. From my recollection (this was over 10 years ago), when they rechecked a month or two later, there were no problems or anything to be worried about."

But his liver panel was higher for a few years before the Cushing's diagnosis and just this week labs showed high liver levels but the stim test for therapeutic Vetoryl (Cushing 's med) was in the best range. I've not seen anyone connect the dots in forums I've read on Cushing's,  but if liver and Cushing's are related,  I would guess it would be the liver trying to filter the higher levels of cortisol and straining at the harder work."
BostonTerrier,3cmcjj,MyNamesRocco,5,Thu Jul 9 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"First, how old is your Boston? Many breeds as puppies have this shaggy line running down the back. I had a German Shepard whose fur did this until over a year old. Also, there is no need to shave a Boston. In fact, you will make your pup worse off by shaving him/her.  The fur keeps your boston cool and shaving him/her will make your pup overheat quickly."

It's not a terrible inconvenience, but we do go though a decent amount of baby wipes. That and our Boston loves recycling her poop. Yum. We also have a friend with a Boston that experiences these same things."
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,prauling,2,Wed Jul 8 16:10:27 2015 UTC,We had to wipe our last Boston. Current 2 need no wiping. One was a poop eater for a while. Vet told us to mix pineapple into his food. Seems like it worked (or he just grew out of it) because he no longer does it.
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,offspringin,3,Wed Jul 8 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"Pineapple? Wow I may need to try this. Our Boston is so fond of ""recycling"" that her farts smell like poop upon poop upon farts."
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,prauling,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:43 2015 UTC,Pineapple tastes terrible to dogs when it has been digested. So you have to feed them pineapple and then let them at least try eating the poop.  If you don't let them taste it they don't learn it tastes horrible.
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,barefootmamaof2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yes! Pineapple works great, if it does t they do sell tablets you can put in their food that makes their poo less appetizing"
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,SACTOKINGS,6,Fri Jul 10 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"Purebred dogs will always have health issues. But compared to French Bulldog, Boston has less health issues. People prefer frenchies because they're stocky and shorter compared to tall and skinny bostons.   As for my Boston, gas is a major problem no matter what his diet is. It's so bad trying to sleep at night next to him x.x Also they are high energy and tend to push themselves more than they can handle. They can overheat easily so be careful playing with them because they will not give up."
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,flooddaga7,6,Wed Jul 8 09:08:31 2015 UTC,"Stinky farts are never a MAJOR problem. Sure, they can clear a room. Sure, sleeping with his booty right under my face and a fan at the bottom of the bed makes for a miasmic shock... But compared to actual MAJOR problems dog breeds can have, farts are nothing. Everything about Bostons, even the gross farts, I find endearing. They are wonderful little neotinized gremlins, always getting into mischief but then down to snuggle later."
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,barefootmamaof2,4,Wed Jul 8 15:53:35 2015 UTC,I think you meant to say purebred breeds will always have some health issues within the breed...  not every dog of that breed will have those issues.
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,storm_queen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:16:44 2015 UTC,"Just look for a breeder who does yearly Baer testing and is registered with with OFFA. Cataracts, luxating patellas and hearing are the big issues to look for- so as long as you have a breeder who mentions that her dogs are tested often for those issues you should be good. Look at health guarantees that are offered too. :)"

While he's not a 'runner' if you let him off the lead at the park and he takes a fancy to another dog you'll have a hard time getting him back!"
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,offspringin,3,Wed Jul 8 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"Aside from the stink and the drool, I can't really think of too many cons. They tear through toys like nobody's business, so you either have to buy lots of cheap toys or a couple expensive durable toys. And they tend to be prone to allergies sometimes, to certain types of food or grass or whatever."
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,NinjaShira,2,Wed Jul 8 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"All true. We have bought all toys known to man.

BostonTerrier,3cit0t,sambatrader,2,Wed Jul 8 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"I recently got my Boston a stuffed toy from Fluff n Tuff, and that thing really is indestructible. Like you said, most stuffed toys last a day or two at most, but I gave this one to him almost two months ago, and it's still alive and kicking. Even the squeaker lasted a full two weeks before that died out. It's lined with a kevlar-like fabric so their teeth can't tear it up, and the eyes and stuff are sewn on instead of like button eyes, so there's nothing for them to grab onto and rip out.  It was a little pricey, but it's his absolute favorite toy ever now."

BostonTerrier,3cit0t,wipeuntilitbleeds,3,Thu Jul 9 06:21:52 2015 UTC,"We have 2 Boston's currently. 1 pure, 1 mixed but heavy Boston. Had 1 pure before these 2 guys. Both currents are make rescues. About 2-3 years apart in age.   Personalities differ as much as peoples do. One is fairly laid back, somewhat of a loner unless he wants attention. Other wants attention all the time.   One rarely plays. Goes hard if he does. The other 90% of the time has a ball. Extremely persistent. At night we have to take them away until he gets the point. Sometimes he will bring as many as 5 until he gives up and goes to bed.   Both will usually sleep in the bed with us though one likes to sleep in the back if the closet too.   One does not have a reaction to fleas. The other will chew himself bloody. On a great pill now that seems to have solved his issues.   Heat and cold, as you noted are a big thing. We have a kiddie pool outside for the summer. They lay in it to cool off. Under about 60 degrees they start to shiver. Need a shirt or a jacket.   They will go until I think their heart might explode. Ball chasing has to be stopped by us. That dog will just keep doing it until he cramps up or overheats.   Both of ours suck at swimming. Both need life jackets. They sink and panic.   Both the pure Boston's we have had can put a death grip on a ball. Those jaws are ridiculously powerful for their size.   They love to be active. Walks, camping etc. they show great affection. All of ours are excellent travelers in the car. Ours are good with my dad's dogs and kids BUT we rarely go to the dog park anymore. They don't start trouble but they are always involved with it. They go into pack mode and both will go after one dog. It gets crazy. They only act that way there. So we don't go.   Eyeballs protrude. Eye injuries can happen easy.   Overall great dogs. We love them. Would get more. Farty 100%. Clear the room farty. Smell the fart upwind farty."

BostonTerrier,3cit0t,oooh_snappp,3,Sat Jul 11 06:17:44 2015 UTC,Seconding everything the other posters said.  They are hilarious and ridiculous and super loving.  Ball obsessions seem to be common.  Eye injuries are common.  Luxating patellas are super common.  Even with the common issues they are just amazing dogs.  So full of personality.  Their faces are so much more expressive than many other breeds and it makes them just hilarious and very endearing.
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,3,Thu Jul 9 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"There arent really any cons (aside from the potential eye injuries and eye problems that can occur later in life). The farts, snoring,  and drool become endearing, especially the fart face"
BostonTerrier,3cit0t,cloudprintchicken,3,Thu Jul 9 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"The teething phase is difficult and expensive. Invest in Bitter Apple spray. Activity levels will vary with Bostons...some are pedal to the metal 95% of the time and some only 20% of the time. I've also experienced Bostons with only 2.5 years of puppy phase (energetic all. the. time.) and Bostons who have 13 years of puppy phase.   They have the potential of being as active as you, ours run 5Ks with us.  Their turd cutters definitely are not the best; we also need to wipe after the bathroom. We buy toys just see how long it will take to destroy them. One of ours has a sensitive tummy (probably why we need to wipe), so I think for these guys, the higher quality food, the better their digestion and for some, the less smelly they will be. In addition to the farting, snoring and snorting, they burp.   There really aren't too many cons, they're wonderful dogs. However, once you get one, you will want another."

He was a very loud snorer, but that's something my whole family got used to very quickly. My boy got overheated quite easily so we had to make sure there was always a quiet, cool area he could go to relax when it was warm outside; when he was hot, he would pant loudly nonstop, which was quite disturbing (and made it hard to sleep). He also was a maniac when it came to chew toys; we bought him a plushie toy when he was a baby, it was destroyed in a split second, and we never bought him one again - stick to tough, hard rubber toys (like Kong) and they'll last for ages and my Boston never got tired of chewing on them.   Boston Terriers are the sweetest dogs and a joy to have in your life, guaranteed."
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,kgb26,5,Wed Jul 8 02:25:46 2015 UTC,It's a Boston but not a $800 Boston. If you're going to pay that much the Boston should meet the AKC standards. Just my opinion though.
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,Megatron904,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I think asking $800 for a black and white Boston is a little much. My mom is a breeder and when she did black and whites, she sold them for closer to $400. Now she deals mainly in red/brown Bostons, and those are apparently more expensive (don't honestly know why, but apparently it's a thing?) and so they go for like $800-$900 a pop."
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,NinjaShira,3,Wed Jul 8 18:27:09 2015 UTC,That cheap? I'm currently in Ohio and the range I see is $600-1200. I'm originally from California and everything online was $1500+
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,NinjaShira,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"Could just be a result of regional availability, maybe. I think airlines just passed new regulations regarding shipping flat-faced dogs like Bostons and Pugs, due to medical complications while they're flying. So if there are only two breeders in California who provide Bostons, they can jack up the price because they're the only place you can get them, without driving halfway across the country.  Meanwhile, my mom for example is in Georgia. And just looking at the sidebar on this subreddit, there are three Boston rescue organizations that service Georgia, and that's not counting any other breeders in the area. So with more competition, people have to lower their prices.  That's just a guess, though."
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,barefootmamaof2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:55:54 2015 UTC,1200-1500 is pretty typical in the Midwest. We are currently looking at a breeder in Cali and with lineage we will be paying more than that ;) location and health guarantees determine price
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,barefootmamaof2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"$800 is not much for a black/white Boston- but the parents do not look breed standard so I would be cautious and look for health testing etc with the parents   Price is often determined by location though, it seems like many southern states have lower priced Bostons in comparison to the Midwest for example.   The red/brown is actually not an akc recognized color ;)"

You'll want to see if the parents have good temperaments, what the puppy's personality is like, and what the conditions are like.  Our breeder allowed us to visit and decided which puppy we wanted, as well as meet the parents, a few weeks before the pups were ready to go home.  Also, we were on a wait list so we were notified as soon as his mom gave birth and got weekly photo updates of the litter as well as updates on puppy weights, temperaments, whose eyes were open, who started walking and exploring, etc, as well as updates on vaccinations.  Once we selected our pup we got weekly photo updates of just him, including shots of him playing with her other dogs."

The left parent's ears are batlike unlike bostons with pointy tip. Don't support these backyard breeders.  Edit: it could be just the lighting and the angle of the photo. It's best to double check in person. Here's a site for identifying bostons: http://www.coloredbostonterriertruths.com If they claim they've ""lost"" the parents paperwork, I'd run away."
BostonTerrier,3ci5g1,Skitten1203,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:57:32 2015 UTC,"I have a CKC Purebread boston that doesnt meet the ACK standards of colours. So it actually is possible and depends what you want - you only need a purebread if you plan to show the dog. If you're looking for temperment than it's making sure there wasnt a breed you're not fond of, mixed up in there. Pet breeders can be great but you always need to make sure they're not backyard breeding or a puppy mill. 1. if it's from a shop it's 100% a puppymill 2. if they wont show you where the puppies sleep, the parents in person, just walk away. Don't let them make you feel awkward for seeing their house - if they sleep outside of the house [the puppies] that's a backyard breeder. - the house should be clean and so should the puppy area 3. like @sactokings ask for the parents papers 4. check that the breeder is registered with your local ACK [for USA] and CKC [for Canada]  why should we care? I mean beyond the crazy cruelty videos we have seen, if the mother was in distress during pregnancy, or the puppy wasnt properly taken care of for the first weeks of it's life, this could result in personality issues you might not necessarily be able to train out of the dog.  If you're willing to be rescuing a puppy from any mill or backyard breeder just know you might need to work harder with the dog on training and this will require being very positive yourself. And it could result in some huge vet bills because the de-worming, shots, vet checks are often forged."

BostonTerrier,3c70fz,huey88,3,Sun Jul 5 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"Normally the earliest you want to separate a puppy from its mother is 8 weeks. They learn a bunch of stuff from the mom during that time so if they are separated earlier, they might have some behavioral issues.   As far as shots are concerned, usually they have their base vaccines at 6 weeks and a recall 4 weeks later.   Be careful with bostons, they can have a lot of health issues and getting them from an unknown source can be a problem. My first Boston was blind by the age of 2 from juvenile cataracts, had chronic ear infections and had other health problems...  This doesn't mean that this pup is going to have issues, he could be just fine but i'd be real careful if i were you"

BostonTerrier,3c70fz,kitties4ever1,4,Sun Jul 5 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"the behavioral issues I mentioned is not related to Bostons, it's related to dogs that are taken away from their mother too early.   As for the Boston health issues, google it, its well documented."
BostonTerrier,3c70fz,Mishtal,2,Sun Jul 5 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"I have a 9 month old Boston who is the greatest dog I've ever had. Our plan was to get him at 8 weeks old, but when we went down to visit him at 6 weeks, the breeder was very clear that she wanted the puppies gone. It was pretty obvious she didn't want to take care of them anymore so we were worried about leaving him there and took him home with us that day. I would not change what happened, and he is well adjusted and a really great dog."
BostonTerrier,3c70fz,damnitdana,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"It depends. Would you be paying a lot for the puppy? I would be wary of the fact that there isn't a health guarantee.   We got our puppy, Finn, from a reputable breeder and he came with a one year guarantee. When he was around 5-6 month old we found out that he has a pretty serious defect called hemivertebrae, has spinal issues as a result, and will eventually end up in a wheelchair. 😔 apparently Bostons are more prone to this defect that other dogs because they're bred to have these type of vertebrae in their tails. Because of the health guarantee, the breeder has agreed to refund his purchase price. Of course, we've already spent more than that on vet bills but without the guarantee, we'd be out even more money."

BostonTerrier,3bncrk,tehoose,2,Tue Jun 30 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Nearly killed a kitten I had rescued from my garage.   She thought it was funny.
BostonTerrier,3bncrk,underwaterfishes,2,Tue Jun 30 22:20:37 2015 UTC,Our Penny loves to rile up the other dogs at the dog park. One time recently a nice woman was playing fetch with her retriever with a large branch. Penny watched as the woman threw the stick and as son as it landed she sprinted and fetched the stick and started running away with it. Keep in mind this stick is almost twice the length of her and part of it is just dragging on the ground. She is surprisingly nimble and quick for a supposedly non-athletic dog. It took quite awhile for the retriever to get its stick back. We apologized to the lady but couldn't stop laughing! We've definitely got a troll dog.
BostonTerrier,3bncrk,ninz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"My grandparents Boston, Millie, was being watched by my parents. She was let out to use the bathroom late one night before bed. She ran off into the dark for a couple of minutes only to return with a huge mole in her mouth! She was so proud of what she had done too!   She also likes to take all of her toys out of the box after they have been put away."
BostonTerrier,3bncrk,approx_volume,2,Wed Jul 1 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"Hah, Bacon does the same thing with his toys. As soon as I put them in the basket, he has to go and pick out all his favorite ones and put them back on his bed. Not to play with them, just so they'll be there when he needs them!"
BostonTerrier,3bncrk,PanicHouse,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:37:23 2015 UTC,His morning ritual after his morning walk is to grab his toy squirrel and do laps around the couch full speed.  He will get quite a few laps in then eats his breakfast.    Every single morning and it's hilarious every time.

BostonTerrier,3bgbuu,kcpeach4,2,Sun Jun 28 23:49:41 2015 UTC,She gets this spotty rash that will scab over after a few days. It doesn't seem to bother her much as she doesn't try to scratch or bite her arms. It just looks bad and makes me feel terrible. My thoughts are that she's allergic to the grass around my apartment and surrounding area. She stays on leash and she's never in questionable areas where she could get into poison ivy or anything like that. would you guys suggest an allergy test or am I just being overly concerned?
BostonTerrier,3bgbuu,Amoprobos,2,Sun Jun 28 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"My BT struggled with this recently. The only thing that got rid of the rash and her horrible dandruff was adding coconut oil to her food. I'm not one of the people who think coconut oil is a cure all, so I was really surprised"
BostonTerrier,3bgbuu,nitz26,2,Sun Jun 28 23:57:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! I'll start adding a bit to her food.

He walks through a lot of tall grass and stuff on our walks, so i assumed it was either little buggy bites or an allergy to the stuff he goes romping through. It doesn't seem to bother him, so I don't do too much to it other than put neosporin on it if it opens up so nothing gets infected and make sure he gets regular baths to help wash off whatever might be bugging him."
BostonTerrier,3bgbuu,fattymcgigglepants,2,Mon Jun 29 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"my pup gets this too, its like spotty red marks then they become dark dots as they heal. would the coconut oil help?"

I didn't know what Nettle was but after seeing a photo of the plant I know I've seen them growing here and there around the area.  Thanks you for all of your advice everyone! Much appreciated!"
BostonTerrier,3bgbuu,emalen,2,Mon Jun 29 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"Chester gets rashes when he plays with other dogs for long periods of time outside. We think it's an allergy to certain grasses and/or other dogs' slobber, which is apparently more common than we thought."
BostonTerrier,3bfcx6,drewjamesSB,4,Sun Jun 28 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"Does this only happen while you're away from home?

BostonTerrier,3bfcx6,wurzle,2,Sun Jun 28 19:04:37 2015 UTC,My boy did the same.  Pretty sure he was bored so we switched him to a folded up throw blanket for awhile and he stopped shredding his beds.
BostonTerrier,3bfcx6,PanicHouse,2,Sun Jun 28 20:17:30 2015 UTC,I bought four beds before I decided some dogs just aren't meant to have anything with stuffing. Mine even went through an indestructible Kong bed. He has survived without one.

BostonTerrier,3b96ll,Hindsight_DJ,2,Sat Jun 27 03:36:19 2015 UTC,"As you've read, the reason they droop as a puppy is due to calcium being diverted. This happens to most straight eared dogs in the 2-6 month range (average). When puppies teethe the body diverts majority of the calcium available to tooth growth and production. One of the most common side-effects is ear drooping. It's completely normal, and they should perk back up in a few weeks time, maybe longer (very small percentage will remain floppy, mostly due to genetics however). No worries, it's natural.

She was putting weight on it probably the week following the operation. I'd say cost was somewhere between 1k and 2k. She's just fine now with some limited limping every once and a while. Whenever it's bothering her, we have some anti-inflammatory medicine that we give her, but we rarely have to do so. She's running and jumping around with our other dog as we speak, and I'd say she's pretty much back to full speed, with just those couple of rare times a year where it aggravates her again."

BostonTerrier,3ab0y2,juliadoulia402,3,Thu Jun 18 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Bostons get along with pretty much every other kind of dog or cat or person in existence. The only thing you have to watch out for is mixing certain genders. If one of your boy dogs is an alpha, you really shouldn't bring another boy into the house, because they could get aggressive or get into pissing contests with each other. It's generally a safer bet to get a boy and a couple girls.  And, because it was demanded, here's a picture of little mister Khan and Sasha the Great Pyrenees."

Usually they just crack back a bit and we clip the broken part off and keep an eye on it. We did have one crack back into the quick one time. Vet just trimmed it up and gave is antibiotic creme.

BostonTerrier,39knho,doubleflusher,2,Fri Jun 12 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"The one toy that's lasted longer than most is a ball like this. He can't really get enough of a grip on it to chew it to pieces, but he loves chasing it and playing tug-of-war with it.  And I recently picked up something I didn't think existed - a stuffed toy that he can't tear to shreds. It's called Fluff n' Tuff, and I think it's made of magic. They line the toy with a kevlar-inspired fabric so it can't be torn apart, and the eyes are flat so they can't be ripped out. It's already lasted three weeks, which is way longer than any other stuffed toy he's had."
BostonTerrier,39knho,downtown_gal,2,Sun Jun 14 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"Chew toys/treats for our two BTs include: Cow Knee Caps (cheap and they last forever), deer antlers (expensive, but again, last forever), dogwood stick, JW Hol-ee Roller, nylabones and rope chews.

BostonTerrier,39hnqn,java-dev,2,Thu Jun 11 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"I had the same concern and decided to get the ""puppy apartment"". So far it's working wonderfully and our pup can relieve himself while we're away. They claim it works for any age. If you're on a budget, you can probably buy the petco version and fabricate the divider yourself, however you would need to order the DVD which comes with the original crate as it's rather essential for proper potty training."
BostonTerrier,39hnqn,jaykoob,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:14:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  So a question then.  Did the puppy apartment work really well?  Did you do it like what they did on the promo video?   Does the dog ever go outside? Or do they just do this all the time now? Does it stink? too terribly?
BostonTerrier,39hnqn,jaykoob,2,Thu Jun 11 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"There are 3 phases of potty training and my pup is still on the first one, so he's staying home for now. The outside potty will come later. The pads have a desinfectant so you can't really smell much and we do change the pads once or twice a day. Best thing about it is knowing that the puppy doesn't have to suffer holding his bladder. It's also convenient in the rain."
BostonTerrier,39hnqn,dead_monster,2,Fri Jun 12 01:22:47 2015 UTC,"9 hours is a long time for any dog, let alone a puppy.  I would recommend finding a dog walker, just to give your pup some outside time.  Being stuck alone in a house is a tough situation for a young dog, and Bostons are notorious high energy dogs so this combo can lead to behavior issues.   For a cheap dog walker, I would try to find a somewhat responsible neighborhood kid or a senior that wouldn't mind some puppy companionship."

BostonTerrier,39d179,prauling,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:19:55 2015 UTC,Technically we use them for everything. I have used them to clean out the corner of our Boston's eyes because she loves rolling in dirt.
BostonTerrier,39d179,Joobug,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"She has a corkscrew nubbin of a tail so I clean the crevices and under her tail to get out any loose fur, dead skin, etc. As far as actually wiping her bum she's on Apoquel for her allergies and it can cause her poo to be less than solid so she'll have a smear or dingleberry sometimes."
BostonTerrier,39d179,ljuvlig,2,Thu Jun 11 18:43:09 2015 UTC,My older Boston has a similar issue. She has a 'tight tuck' tail. There's little room between her bum and her tail and sometimes poop ends up on her tail. We use baby wipes on her bottom and for 'spot baths' as needed. We haven't had any issues.
BostonTerrier,39d179,bassfingerz,3,Fri Jun 12 06:10:36 2015 UTC,"I bought these to use on my dog's feet when she comes inside after a walk to minimize her allergic reactions to pollen, etc. and they seem fine. They're fragrance free, and they tear in half easily, so I use half of a wipe on her feet after each walk, and the box lasts twice as long. If they're safe enough for a baby's butt... Edit: And yeah, every once in awhile I have to wipe her butt with it if she has a dingleberry."

BostonTerrier,38lkqu,Ropes4u,27,Fri Jun 5 00:26:19 2015 UTC,Our old Boston Terrier spent the last hour of her life staring at the sun. We rescued her starving and freezing to death in 2006 or 2008 and she has hated being cold ever since. She has always loved basking in the warmth of sun. It wasn't unusual to walk outside and see her sitting and staring at the sun like this. I am grateful she was allowed one more hour of sun before moving on.
BostonTerrier,38lkqu,InternetWeakGuy,8,Fri Jun 5 00:27:01 2015 UTC,Glad she had a happy last hour.  Condolences to you and your family.

He goes in the pool at my in law's house, and at first we thought he was too dumb to figure out how to get out. Nope, he knows how, he just doesn't want to!  We live in Florida so most of the places we can go canoeing have alligators, which means it's very not okay for him to jump in the water. :-/"

BostonTerrier,37sezm,kiky23,1 point,Sat May 30 11:36:38 2015 UTC,"Does your pup act paralyzed when wearing it? The vet was concerned about my guy being stoic, but once they took off the cone he acted like himself. He also did this when I tried using a halter instead of a collar. But he goes along with anything, my brave little wimp."
BostonTerrier,37sezm,vwgtiturbo,2,Sat May 30 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, instead she rests it against things and pretends like it's hindering her every move. So she walks up to a doorway, rests the cone on it, and doesn't move until someone moves her. Then she pretends like she can't get on the sofa or can't get into the crate. She's a brat."

My puppy Monti got into expired meds on Wednesday. He's been hospitalized and now they are stumped because his blood pressure is very low, he might have something else going on. I'm trying the best to be responsible for my little guy but holy cow it's expensive! Anyone have any advice about pet insurance especially on that has a quick effective date? Also future advice about PICA behavior is appreciated because this little guy eats anything and everything he finds. Thanks."
BostonTerrier,37r4x8,whatthefrickenfrack,3,Fri May 29 19:08:51 2015 UTC,Most pet insurance isn't effective for at least 30 days after getting it. And if it's a pre condition that is documented that the dog had before signing up for insurance they won't cover it.
BostonTerrier,37r4x8,Qliphah,1 point,Sat May 30 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"This is why I want to do it before a diagnosis.  It's not pre-existing until it's an official diagnosis, right?"
BostonTerrier,37r4x8,datadiva9,3,Sat May 30 05:53:12 2015 UTC,Vet bills can be ridiculous especially if they involve surgery or prolonged care. I've seen over the past decade the move to treat pets more like humans so pet insurance may be a thing... I dunno.   But you may want to check with your home owners insurance as a pet is usually considered property. I know here we pay taxes on dogs as if they were boats or cars so I don't see why insurance companies should see them any different.

BostonTerrier,37ln8x,belcorvo,3,Thu May 28 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"How long is she in the crate?  I recommend creating a schedule.  Taking her out every hour and shortly after eating or drinking.  Try making her run to the door when you take her out, the movement should help her realize she has to go."
BostonTerrier,37ln8x,ZZBC,2,Fri May 29 04:01:23 2015 UTC,"Tux did that for a while.  It stopped at about 6 months.  When the crate training wasn't working, I started locking him in a good sized bathroom in my house, and he started doing his business in the corner when I wasn't home to let him out, which was a good sign that he was starting to understand not to go in his ""space"".    He's just about a year old now, and does have accidents about once a week if no one's home to let him out, but other than that he lets me know when he has to go.    I think that Ripley thinks her crate is her potty area and not her sleeping area.  Maybe putting her crate outside where she is supposed to go might help?  Might be a pain in the butt moving it but weening her off the crate and onto grass might be one way of going about it.  I'm no potty training expert (from what I've heard I got lucky with Tux.. minimal training) but Rip is still really young and new to the world.  Patience!"

The 13yo is also a heavy panter and snorter. She has cushing's disease, so I attribute much of the panting to cushing's."

BostonTerrier,376681,dextertheboston,2,Mon May 25 05:18:34 2015 UTC,Finally caught on video!! My Boston has been doing this lately where he raises his head and sticks out his tongue. He gets frozen or stuck like this and cries. Lasts 5-20 seconds. Started off just once/mo over six months. Has since increased. Today he did it 10 times when he played with his favorite doggy friend. Seems to be triggered by activity. Vet isn't sure what is wrong from my description. Did Xray initially with no indications of an issue. Just sent him the video and waiting to hear back. Our thoughts are that maybe it's a seizure? Hoping to find an answer! Tia!!

His was more in his hind quarters, and after looking around on Youtube found it was a common problem and what yours and mine were showing were mild seizures. Turns out it's a pretty common breed problem and can be helped a lot by changing their diet to a duck and potato dog food. Can't remember exactly why it helps, but we went from 1 or 2 seizures a month to zero seizures for almost a year now.  Hope it helps you as much as it did us."

BostonTerrier,36y7g9,Jescro,7,Sat May 23 02:52:26 2015 UTC,Congrats on your new puppy. You are now in puppy mode. Remove the area rug. Clean it because the smell may attract the puppy. Put your puppy on a timer. Every two hours take him out. make potty time fun with praise and treats for completion. Kennel when you are not home or at night until he is accident free. IT will be a busy couple of months but it will be totally worth it.
BostonTerrier,36y7g9,fade1979,1 point,Sat May 23 04:05:36 2015 UTC,This is great. Thanks so much. The rug is now rolled up in my closet and I'll start on this routine.

No issues so far, knock on wood!"
BostonTerrier,36y7g9,coopsadaisy,1 point,Sat May 23 17:54:38 2015 UTC,Cannot agree any more! Puppies MUST have a routine. The more consistent you are with the routine the fast he will become house broken. Also EVERY time he potties outside he should be rewarded. Our Chester is just over a year old and we still praise him for pottying outside and he hasn't had an accident in the past 8 months. Good luck!
BostonTerrier,36y7g9,ZZBC,1 point,Tue May 26 11:13:56 2015 UTC,"PUPPY MODE! We have a puppy who is 11 weeks... and THIS. We rolled up our rugs and took away anything in puppy reach. And when it comes to housebreaking... Take her out before we leave, when we get home (even if we only left 10 mins ago), every two hours, or any time she whimpers or even looks like she might need to pee. She's already asking to go outside or going outside by herself when the door is open!"
BostonTerrier,36y7g9,IDontKnwU,2,Tue May 26 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"I'd start with letting him out every hour or hour and a half.  Put him in his kennel when you're not home or doing something where you can't supervise him.  In the morning, take him straight from the kennel right outside.  And use a specialized pet cleaner with enzymes to remove the smell from the rug (just because you can't smell it doesn't mean he can't).  I'd also remove the rug until he's consistently going outside."
BostonTerrier,36y7g9,SrirachaChan,1 point,Sat May 23 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks!. Yeah I picked up some of that enzym cleaner based on a recommendation from my friend with a Boston. Only problem is my little guy is just too young, he's not marking any territory, just going when he pleases - so he doesn't really go in the same spot. But you said pretty much what the other guy here did, so I'll start on a routine. Appreciate the advice!"

We have lots of testing that will be done tomorrow and I'm hoping to get it removed as soon as we can. We might max out our credit cards or have to beg my husband's grandpa for money but she is so worth it. This picture is on her with our daughter who was only 8 days old. If she can love that much she deserves every chance she can get.

BostonTerrier,36mef5,thegypsychild,3,Wed May 20 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Great job! That's awesome! I'm not trying to make you feel like you haven't done everything just right, because judging by the treats in the video, you're using free shaping, and luring.. that's great!  However. Dogs do not naturally generalize. This means you can teach your dog ""sit"" in the living room, and when you two go into the bathroom and you ask for a ""sit"" your dog will say ""what is sit? We only do that in the living room..."" Proofing a behavior takes a lot of work. Months of work. Not just a week.  If you want a truly reliable sit, you have to work on the three D's. Distance, Duration, and Distraction.  First, duration. See how long you can keep your dog in a sit while feeding treats randomly. Build up duration over the course of a week or so before moving to the next D. In order to truly have duration down, you should have the beginnings of a release cue worked out. This cue can be ""okay"" ""done"" or something equally as short. When teaching a release cue, say the release cue as you back up and encourage your dog towards you, then reward. Always reward your puppy for getting up if you've used the release cue.  Distance. Now that you have duration down, and your dog will sit for at least a minute without moving, add distance. If you can only manage to take a half-step before your pup gets up, then try just rocking back onto your back leg, shifting your weight just slightly, before shifting your weight back and rewarding.  When working on building distance, always work very slowly, and always return to your dog before rewarding. You can use a release cue as a reward, but I typically recommend rewarding for the dog remaining in position.  Work on just half turning around, or just taking one step away before returning to your pup yo reward, etc. Work very slowly.  Next is distraction. If you've moved onto distraction your dog has a pretty incredible sit already. Distraction means adding things like, opening the fridge with your puppy in a sit, tossing a ball past your puppy while they're sitting, running by your puppy while they sit nicely.  Distraction also means beginning to finally work on the cue outdoors. In order to help your puppy generalize, you have to teach the cue from scratch like your puppy has never heard of it before when you begin to work outdoors. Back to step one of luring, step one duration, step one distance, step one distraction.  It is possible that your puppy, already understanding the cue in full, will be able to pick up on it a little faster, but don't become frustrated if that isn't the case! Working outdoors is tough stuff! Make sure you use high value treats like hotdogs, cooked white meat chicken, cheese sticks, bacon, etc - all cut into tiny pea sized pieces. These treats will help with keeping the pups attention onto you in the distracting outdoors.  Critique on video: be sure to separate the cue with the lure. As in, say the cue, pause a moment, then if he has not performed the behavior yet you then lure him. Do not say the cue and lure simultaneously, because then your puppy will always need to see the lure to perform the behavior. So it'd be like this: ""sit"" count to two slowly, lure behavior, reward.  Eventually your puppy will want to skip the lure because dogs are scavengers. they're always looking for the fastest way to the treat. He'll sit when he hears the cue instead of waiting for the lure."
BostonTerrier,36mef5,jourtney,2,Wed May 20 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you so much for this!! Will definitely work on these 3 D's. :) He does 'sit' everywhere and anytime when he hears 'sit' though! Haha. Okay, grabbing his treats and proceeding to training. Lol. Thanks again!"

I don't know anything about OP, but even the worst kind of backyard breeder can produce cuties. Doesn't mean we should buy from them."
BostonTerrier,369lxl,ljuvlig,3,Sun May 17 21:24:27 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with you there. I am no backyard breeder. I'm an experienced Boston owner and all the pups are very healthy and well taken care of. This is the mother's first and only litter. I had her spayed during the same operation that they did the c-section. ALL the money from the pups are going towards the veterinary bill for the mother's c-section. I'm actually not making any profit at all. I'll actually be making less than what is needed.
BostonTerrier,369lxl,ljuvlig,2,Sun May 17 22:18:36 2015 UTC,Just checking ;)  Bostons are truly expensive to breed!

BostonTerrier,3627xj,desleppard,1 point,Fri May 15 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"I keep meaning to respond to this! My 6 year old Boston Terrier had a soft palate and nares resection when he was about 2 years old. I adopted him at about 15 months old, and looking back on it I think his previous owners knew about how bad Brachycephalic Syndrome was. He ""talked"" a LOT and made crazy sounds. Nobody would neuter him until his breathing was fixed (there's a chance he could die if given anesthesia with the elongated soft palate.) I got at least 4 different opinions from 4 different vets... ranging from he needs surgery RIGHT NOW to ""he was born this way"" and it's what nature intended. Plus all the different surgery options.  I think all the advice and opinions I gathered led to a well informed decision. In the end, I decided to do the surgery sooner rather than later, because as one of the vets told me: 1. He would need surgery one way or the other—whether it was up front when he's young and it's bit proactive, or later when his labored breathing causes other complications that needs different kinds of treatment and attention; and also 2. If he ever needed anesthesia, he would need the procedure. I didn't want to end up in a spot where there was an emergency and I had to also worry about this surgery or be in a place that didn't specialize/wasn't familiar with it.  I took him to a specialist in Culver City, CA that was equipped with a special laser and was very familiar with the procedures. Any vet could just resect with a scalpel but apparently even though it's much cheaper, it causes way more pain and a longer recovery time.  I want to say the soft palate & nares resection + neuter ended up costing $2700 when it was all said and done but it may have been less or more (not sure... it was a while ago. I know it was in the thousands tho.) I went a more conservative route, but he was my first dog and I felt like I needed to take responsibility, and once I made the decision to do it I wanted to do it right. Thankfully, the surgery made a HUGE difference in his breathing and upper airway sounds, even though they say there's no guarantee. I feel much better about his well being now!"
BostonTerrier,3627xj,coopsadaisy,1 point,Wed May 20 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the response! I'm glad your pup has fared well :) I figured it would be in the thousands..I made a consultation appt for this Friday. I think it'll definitely be worth it just for the piece of mind.
BostonTerrier,360cmg,suckassmule,1 point,Fri May 15 00:51:00 2015 UTC,Love their 'big' smiles :)
BostonTerrier,360p6g,mrtalent,3,Fri May 15 02:44:21 2015 UTC,Transition your dog to a better diet. Bostons have notoriously sensitive digestive systems and a lot of gas likely means they're not tolerating something they're eating very well. People joke about Bostons farting a lot but it can be reduced/eliminated completely with diet.
BostonTerrier,360p6g,ihaveseenthefnords,2,Fri May 15 08:51:40 2015 UTC,"They will only fart if you feed them bad food.  Get a decent ""vet"" branded food and you wont smell a thing.  Ours only stink after eating cheap food or being feed human food. I gave them bits of prawn tails once. OMG I thought I was going to die from the smell."
BostonTerrier,360p6g,xordis,2,Fri May 15 08:57:22 2015 UTC,Vet branded foods generally aren't great either. Science diet for the most part has corn or corn by product as the #1 ingredient
BostonTerrier,360p6g,eacrataes,2,Sat May 16 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Along with what everyone else is saying, ours stopped farting when we switched her to raw. A lot of human food makes her gassy too so we only give her pieces of fruit and veg on occasion.   Edit: we discovered she basically emits poison gas if we give her eggs so we figured if someone really pisses us off we'll give the dog eggs and then take her for a visit ;)"
BostonTerrier,360p6g,ninz,1 point,Fri May 15 12:07:09 2015 UTC,Ours get set off be anything wheat based so you could eliminating that. If you feed him dry food you have to check it carefully  for wheat products.

BostonTerrier,35qv3z,SchweddyBurrito,3,Tue May 12 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"TLDR, it sucks but probably worth it.  Our dog had a luxating patella and a torn CCL (ACL in humans, CCL in dogs). We were told she needed TTA surgery which would rectify both problems - basically they restructure the geometry of the knee. She was between 1-2 years old and an adoption, so there was no breeder to go after for recompense.   It was a pretty confusing time because we wanted to make the correct decision but we didn't want to put her into surgery if it wasn't necessary. And maybe we were too reluctant with her rehab, but frankly we didn't want to blow our money risking another injury by doing too much too soon. We got a second opinion, and I even considered a third before just pulling the trigger on getting it done.  I feel like we were definitely told ""6-8 weeks for recovery"" and thinking that she would be up jumping around. That was obviously bullshit. As far as I'm concerned it took 8 weeks before she could start doing very basic rehab, and it took more than a year to get back.   8 weeks is probably somewhere in the area of doing a very short walk 50 feet and back, twice a day. Slowly building up from there, no stairs, no jumping, no running of any kind. Swimming is good exercise and we did a thing at a local dog rehab place that had a big hot tub to help teach her to swim and rehab her knee. Of course I made a stupid video of it.  Before the surgery I threw the ball for her every day. Inside of that first year I would have told you ""I honestly have no idea if we made the right decision"" because she would sometimes show these signs of limping tenderness. I'd also kick myself for over-doing it.   She will be 5 years old in a week and I'm glad we did the surgery. She swims like crazy, and fetches the ball like mad. I take her basically every day as she tears up the field while people marvel how fast my six-million-dollar-dog is."
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,darren_co,1 point,Tue May 12 23:49:05 2015 UTC,aw omg. That video! So cute but I fear that is going to be our future as well. They think my boy has a torn CCL too. What a bummer! But good to hear a success story.
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,darren_co,2,Wed May 13 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"Is he showing symptoms? When my dog stood up from resting for a while she would keep one leg off the ground like it was asleep and then limp around on 3 legs, slowly putting more weight on it over the course of a few minutes. Under x-ray the doctor measured and noted that her thigh was about 10% smaller on the bad knee side. They put her under anesthetic to diagnose the ligament tear.  We have her (permanently) on a glucosamine supplement since the surgery.   Certainly get a few opinions if you can."
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,branklins,1 point,Wed May 13 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"That's interesting...Sounds a lot like what's going on with us as far as symptoms, how they're trying to diagnose the tear, etc. We're also about to start on glucosamine. Thanks for the advice!"
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,branklins,2,Wed May 13 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"Ours (Darcy) has the same problem. We have not had the surgery yet, but know we need to. She never seems in pain, but it's definitely annoying to her! How much did the vet quote the surgery?"
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,tiny-e,1 point,Tue May 12 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Same, Gustav didn't seem in pain either but it was obviously a problem. Our vet quoted us between $2500 and $3500, not to mention $350 for the x-rays, prelim exam :/"
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,kamw83,1 point,Wed May 13 00:17:40 2015 UTC,Yikes! That's pricey!

Worst thing is my and my husband's company has great pet insurance that we never got around to signing up for >:(  I know there's a medical credit card available, I'm sure your vet will tell you about it if you move forward. Good luck!"
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,thisiswhywehaveants,2,Wed May 13 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"My girl had one and we had the surgery done when she was about 3. It was expensive, on the order of about 3k in the LA area. Her recovery was about two months total but she was walking without issue after about a month. The difficult part was the second month when we had to limit her activity because she seemingly felt fine and wanted to do her normal stuff even though she wasn't fully healed. The good news is the surgery was a complete success and she never had the slightest problem after that right.  One note I remember from my vet: if the dog starts to over use the good knee to compensate for the bad one it increases the chances of stretching that patellar tendon as well.  EDIT: we opted for the surgery despite the cost in part due to her young age. We felt it was worth it at age 3 but may have reached a different decision if she were reaching her later years."
BostonTerrier,35qv3z,yikespencils,1 point,Tue May 12 23:15:19 2015 UTC,Yeah here in Atlanta they quoted us around that much. We heard the same thing from our vet re: the good back knee. Glad your girl came through!

BostonTerrier,35focy,pyneapplepyro,1 point,Sat May 9 22:45:02 2015 UTC,"Though she invited me to visit, the breeder is about 5 hours away from me, so I have only talked to her over the phone.

BostonTerrier,35focy,pyneapplepyro,3,Sat May 9 23:29:27 2015 UTC,Then why do you only have 2 days to discover genetic problems?

BostonTerrier,3529zs,Deathnchaos,2,Wed May 6 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"Start contacting breeders. The best site for this in Australia is dogzonline.com.au  Most Bostons are around $3500+ and Frenchies are $4000+ here in Australia, so make sure you have some spare cash.  There seems to be a few Bostons advertised these days, so there might not be a waiting list, but when I got mine it took about 1.5 years before I found a breeder with a spare pup."
BostonTerrier,3529zs,xordis,2,Wed May 6 16:25:08 2015 UTC,In the US there are rescue groups for all kinds of dogs. Both our Boston's came from a rescue. Maybe something like that in Australia? We got our youngest at 6 months old. The older one was 3 years. Not sure your feelings about the puppy stage. They are super cute then but I didn't mind skipping it. They are much cheaper from the rescues (here anyway). The rescue we use scoops up all the Boston's they can from around the SouthEastern US and foster them until they find owners. They come and check out your house/yard to make sure your a good match for a very active dog.   I'm partial to Boston's. I like Frenchies as well. Bulldogs too. Any of the smashed nose dogs.   Good luck in your quest.

His eyes are moist at times, I haven't noticed any staining yet. He is only 9 months old, hopefully the eye problem doesn't worsen!"
BostonTerrier,34nos6,LolaRockabella,4,Sat May 2 20:54:41 2015 UTC,"We got Daisy a full enucleation rather than an evisceration with a prosthetic. One reason was cost, the other was time. To get a prosthetic involves specialists and fittings, and she was leaking green pus from her eyeball at the moment.   It started 6 years ago when Daisy ran eyeball first into a thistle trying to catch a critter. Her eye swelled to the size of a golf ball and found us in emergency care at midnight.   After that started the eye infections, always in the same eye. One eye infection got nasty fast and she went at it with her paw, tearing her cornea open with her dew claw.   This lead to thousands in vet bills and specialist consultations. We had pet insurance, but even with the $2000 coverage, we were looking at another $3000 in costs for a surgery that wouldn't even guarantee results. We found a vet 30 mins away that felt she could competently treat Daisy for pain management and healing without resorting to the expensive surgery, and we decided to try.   It worked. Daisy's eye healed itself, and even re-routed veins to get blood flowing back to the injured area. Unfortunately, it also left her with a very thin membrane. This we didn't realize until much later.  Over the next 3 years, Daisy would keep getting eye infections, only ever in that eye. We were paying about $200/mo for her medicines, but they always cleared up. We thought this was par for the course with a bug-eyed dog. Then a new vet came to town. The first time he examined Daisy, he asked to get closer images of her eye. That's when we learned the membrane was so thin, she was an accidental hand swat away from it rupturing.  This is when the arguments between me and my husband began. I wanted to remove the eye to prevent the possibility or rupture, he thought I was a cruel bitch who just wanted a pirate dog. He refused to let anyone hurt his princess on purpose. Several eye infections later, he was still determined we just keep treating the symptoms. Finally, when one eye infection was so bad there were huge green globs coming from what looked liked the actual eyeball, I sent him to take her to the vet this time.  He texted me at work saying we should do the removal. Of course, he flip-flopped several times over the next few days, but ultimately we went though with it.   I bawled in the vet's office as I dropped her off. And while driving to work, I had to pull over to retch from the guilt.   36 hours after picking her up, you wouldn't know she had just been through a major surgery. She has almost no idea her eye was removed. Recovery was amazing and pain was minimal. The vet told me he was able to use her own excess tissue to form a psuedo-prosthetic, so rather than a caved-in spot, she just looks like she's winking. people don't even notice when they stop to pet her on our walks.    Edit: Something that helped my husband decide, was a vet quote I read online: ""I'm treating your dog for pain, and you for guilt."" It was about an owner that refused to have an enucleation on her dog with extremely painful cataracts.  Edit2: The full cost, including preliminary blood work (almost 9 with the organs of a 4 year old!), catheter, IV, surgery and all meds and some pill pockets was $650. This is a very small town in Alberta. YMMV.   Edit3: I forgot to mention the two other surgeries she had done to remove cysts growing in her tear ducts. No idea how they tie in to everything else."
BostonTerrier,34nos6,jolleyho,2,Sat May 2 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"Was she already blind in that eye before it was removed?  If not, how did she first start reacting when she got back home?  Going from full perspective; to half of it, can be quite a mind fuck im sure."
BostonTerrier,34nos6,britt42,2,Sat May 2 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"She had a lot of vision in that eye, based on the flick test (flicking your hand towards it) but it was very cloudy, so I don't believe it was full spectrum.   So far, she's navigated exactly as she did before. Almost no perceptible change there. I have noticed her get surprised when something comes at her from that side, and she only sleeps with her working eye side-up now."
BostonTerrier,34nos6,Aeli23,2,Sat May 2 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"We had our BT's removed after many procedures, drops, ointments, etc. He was much happier once it was gone and not more fussing with it. He adapted quite well and I am sure yours will as well!  Never considered a prosthetic, only one more thing that could go wrong. Best of luck!"

BostonTerrier,348jga,LolaRockabella,2,Wed Apr 29 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Section 7. DASY of article  Marcus Luttrell:       As part of Luttrell's recuperation he was given a yellow Labrador puppy. He named the dog DASY. Each letter of the name ""DASY"" represents one of the members of his team—Danny Dietz, Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson, Southern boy (Marcus), and Michael ""Yankee"" Murphy. She was given to him in recovery to help him through rehabilitation.   On April 1, 2009, four men approached Luttrell's property and killed DASY with a .357 Magnum revolver at approximately 1 A.M.   Luttrell proceeded to chase the individuals through four counties in his truck armed with two 9 mm Berettas—until Onalaska Police apprehended the individuals.  Upon arrest, the suspects verbally threatened Luttrell's life and taunted him.  Alfonso Hernandez was arrested on-scene for driving without a valid driver's license and later charged with animal cruelty.  Michael Edmonds turned himself in on April 7, was booked, and posted bond on the same charge. The other two individuals were not indicted. The males are also suspects in the killings of other neighborhood dogs.  On November 29, 2011, Marcus posted on his Facebook Page that ""Court date on Thursday for DASY's killer's I'll keep y'all posted on what happens. It's only been almost 3 years glad it's finally here"" and again on December 1, 2011, saying they were found guilty.   On March 7, 2012, Alfonso Hernandez was given the maximum sentence of two years in a state jail for the felony charge of animal cruelty and fined $1,000. After his guilty plea and testimony against Hernandez, Michael John Edmonds was sentenced to five years probation and fined $1,000 for the same offense. At the sentencing, Luttrell testified that he was “still pretty upset” about the killing of DASY and that he felt both defendants should have gotten the maximum sentence.

Just try to think of all the love and good times you had togther it will lessen the pain a little. All those times make the horrible time we lose them well worth the pain.

So I got another one about a year ago and am hoping having him around when the inevitable day comes will help.  Don't be too hasty to replace her though. Get through the grief first. Time heals all wounds, just get a tub of ice cream and binge watch your favorite TV shows for a couple weeks and you'll get through it!"

When I got the call from my dad I literally collapsed. It's like losing a piece of yourself. Ditto passed 5 years ago but I still keep a picture of him on my dresser.   I know it feels terrible right now, but over time the pain of losing your best friend will subside and you'll become more thankful for the joy she brought to your life while she was here."

Try feeding her rice instead of her regular food too to give her a little something blander for her tummy. Hope she's feeling better soon!

BostonTerrier,33txzq,kcpeach4,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:24:14 2015 UTC,My girlfriend and I have been looking for a while. The family that bred the liter doesn't usually put them up this early but they saw huge interest and so they put them up. The best deal we found on a BT was 600 around here.  The mom was a gorgeous red BT and the dad was built like a tank. Very beautiful dogs and the breeders were very nice local people where we live! This was there last liter so we took the plunge!
BostonTerrier,33txzq,cmue02,3,Sun Apr 26 02:32:07 2015 UTC,A puppy shouldn't be away from his mother that early. They should still be nursing until around 6 weeks
BostonTerrier,33txzq,TheProfessorX,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:12:09 2015 UTC,We arnt taking him away now. He won't be with us until that 6 week time. That's the earliest we may be able to get him. Just depends on how he grows.
BostonTerrier,33txzq,knife_at_a_gun_fight,7,Sun Apr 26 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"6 weeks is still very early as far as removing a puppy from it's mother. Most reputable breeders wouldn't allow this no matter how the demand might be so please be aware of that! General rule of thumb is 8-12 weeks for puppies (smaller breeds staying longer) In fact most states actually have laws that they cannot be sold/taken until 8 weeks.  ETA: also regardless of how high the demand is you definitely made it sound like this is a breeder simply for money and that often leads to issues with the puppies, I'm sure you've done your research but it throws up quite a few red flags."
BostonTerrier,33txzq,cmue02,3,Sun Apr 26 15:46:02 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I picked my BT puppy up when she was about 11wks old and firmly believe she has no behavioral issues due to the fact that she stayed with her parents for much longer. 6 weeks is so young.
BostonTerrier,33txzq,fattymcgigglepants,2,Sun Apr 26 19:14:49 2015 UTC,100 times this. This sounds like a backyard breeder to me. Have they provided any health tests? Have you met the mother and seen where the puppies are living currently?

BostonTerrier,33mdag,oooh_snappp,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:04:30 2015 UTC,"They do amazing together. We messed up when we first introduced them...Bringing Boss (adopted) into the house when Bojangles was gone...and then having them meet inside the house. Apparently, they need to meet on neutral ground. The first week was rough, but it got better and by the 3rd week, you couldn't tell they just met. Now, when one is gone, the other is mopey. They definitely complete each other and Bojangles loves having a playmate. It's really like a little brother, big brother relationship. Boss looks to Bojangles and has learned a lot from him, which is nice.   The only sucky thing is they tend to ""gang up"" on dogs at the dog park if they want to play. I think it just depends on the temperament of the dogs - you want to find a good match. They're also neutered, so that makes a huge difference, I'm sure. For us we weren't looking for a male or female in particular, we just knew if we found the right one, we'd know...and it was total happenstance that we stumbled upon Boss.   Edit: Just because Bojangles (left) Boss (right)"

BostonTerrier,33gvix,krhacken,8,Wed Apr 22 12:43:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm believer than unless you plan on breeding, you should spay/neuter your dog. It leads to less animals in the shelter, and prevents problems in the long run. Even if you don't plan on letting your dog roam the neighborhood, there is always a chance he could get out and impregnate some unspayed female.  We once had a boxer who we didn't neuter and ended up with testicular cancer when he was elder. He was too old to put under anesthesia, so we couldn't neuter him. I wish we had neutered him when he was younger, essentially nipping the cancer in the bud.  I just don't see any reason not to."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,elephantfarts,-2,Wed Apr 22 14:11:37 2015 UTC,There is a growing camp that is preaching not getting your dog neuter/spay until after they are full grown so they have the added benefit of the hormones produced during puberty. Testosterone and estrogen are the primary hormones involved in fusing the bone growth plates. I would hate to rob my bostons of the chance of having properly fused growth plates.
BostonTerrier,33gvix,SingularOne,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have any idea how true that may or may nor be, but wait until they've grown before you get them fixed if that's your thing."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,elephantfarts,2,Wed Apr 22 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"I walk my dog minimum 3 hours a day. Right as we wake up for 5-15 minutes for that morning business. Then we fit in a doggy park visit for half hour to an hour, which gets all her energy out and prevents anxiety or need to chew/have accident. In the evening we usually go out for 20 minutes to get some air before settling in for bed. Sometimes I take her out more frequent but she usually tells me if she absolutely has to go.   I find that as long as I get her to run around and socialize with other dogs on the daily, her behaviour is great. They need it. wouldn't you be anxious and a total brat if you didn't get to talk to anyone who speaks your language?"
BostonTerrier,33gvix,chebstr,3,Thu Apr 23 15:12:06 2015 UTC,"Wow thats a lot of walking. I wish I could give my boston that much, although hes still too young for that. I think my legs would fall off with that much. I dont like to push more than an hour. Currently there is almost always someone at home to keep him company too."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,chebstr,3,Fri Apr 24 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"mine is super active so she kinda needs it, otherwise she gets restless and becomes a whiney little brat"
BostonTerrier,33gvix,cmue02,2,Sat Apr 25 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"If you can wait until they're fully grown at around a year before you neuter I would recommend that! Our 18 month old Boston gets a 20 min walk morning and night with lots of short walks around the neighborhood in between. He goes to ""camp"" 3 days a week and gets a lunch time walk the other 2 days of the week."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,cmue02,2,Fri Apr 24 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"I think this follows my impression of the right time to do it so far. I have a great trainer that suggests the same thing of 18 months. If it does influence behaviour Id like to do it when he would be left most relaxed, but to be honest I think that a chilled out dog comes from good training and good stimulation, oh and a good diet. Whats camp? Doggy day care doesnt seem so common in the UK. I think your level of walking is more to what I was expecting. Ive read morning walks are better for the dog but I have less time before work."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,bstargalactica,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"I call it camp, but really our breeder lives close by (we lucked out big time) so he goes to play with her dogs during the day. I like it a lot more than doggy day care at a commercial site because quite frankly I wouldn't trust my dog at a location like that. Most here also require they're fixed and Since Luke shows that's not possible for us right now.  Our vet even says to wait until 2 if you can (she breeds Bostons as well. Like I said we are so lucky). I also totally agree with you in the fact that socialization, diet, and exercise have more to do with it than simply being neutered. There's plenty of dogs in our neighborhood that are terrors while our in tact male is calm as a cucumber."
BostonTerrier,33gvix,ninz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"So we debated neutering our Boston, he's 8 months now, the vet said it was our decision but did remind us that he would have much higher levels of testosterone if not neutered. Higher levels can, not always, lead to aggression and overly dominant behaviors. So we waited until he was 7 months to give him as long as possible with the higher levels of hormones to help with growth.   Also remember, he is a teenager! And is going to be bratty no matter what, just keep up the practicing and maybe increase your walks to 30 minutes each."

BostonTerrier,332p4p,usmcknifeguy,4,Sun Apr 19 01:42:36 2015 UTC,They are all cute.
BostonTerrier,332p4p,PhillGuy,9,Sun Apr 19 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"Does your back problem prevent you from engaging in physical activity? Bostons are extremely active and need lots and lots of exercise. They are prone to weight gain which is why you see lots of pudgy ones around. If exercise and a potentially heavy dog are not your thing, you might want to consider a different and smaller breed."
BostonTerrier,332p4p,Gurgette,3,Sun Apr 19 01:25:42 2015 UTC,Every dog is prone to weight gain if they're over fed.
BostonTerrier,332p4p,TechnicallyMagic,2,Sun Apr 19 02:54:51 2015 UTC,Or fed the wrong things.  My two will come back 1kg (2.2lb) heavier every time I leave them with my parents for more than a week. (They are around 6kg and 7kg normally) They feed them sausages and all sorts of random cooked/raw meat (muscle) that dogs shouldn't just be eating.  When I pick them up you can see they are visibly bigger. After a few weeks they are back down to normal weight and eating kibble again.

BostonTerrier,332p4p,xordis,5,Tue Apr 21 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"Getting an adult dog is the only way to 100% ensure you are getting the size and features you want. A tiny, dainty puppy could end up being heavy and muscular even with smaller parents."
BostonTerrier,332p4p,KitiHowaito,7,Tue Apr 21 17:52:20 2015 UTC,Please choose a different breed if this is what you would like in a dog. Trying to make mini Bostons isn't healthy for the breed. Boston Terriers ideal weight is between 18-25 lbs. Reputable breeders will not sale these types of dogs but it is common in backyard breeders so please investigate the breeder before you buy the puppy. Local shelters or Boston terrier rescues take in a lot of abandoned Bostons that are on the smaller side. Please Research breeds throughly before you decide to buy. Little Bostons are adorable but they should not be sought out and should be a rare result from a healthy set of parents.
BostonTerrier,332p4p,Chandarrr,3,Sun Apr 19 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with the other comment or below that Bostons 10 pounds are in the standard, you usually only will see bitches below 15 pounds.  I 1 MILLION TIMES AGREE to make sure you don't go to a backyard breeder. Especially with a breed that could have health problems from poor breeding including breathing problems, juvenile cataracts, or patella issues make sure you're going to a quality breeder. If you want a specific size go to a show and see who is showing smaller dogs and talk to them. Different breeders have different types and some like the small square dogs with a beautiful head while others are tipping the scale at 25. A good breeder will know what to expect from their breeding stock"
BostonTerrier,332p4p,cmue02,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:57:31 2015 UTC,The breed standard weight range from the AKC is 10-25lbs.
BostonTerrier,332p4p,sodasopp,2,Sun Apr 19 06:31:57 2015 UTC,"The only semi reliable way to determine if a dog will be big or small is based on their parents size (genetics) but it isn't 100% accurate.  My little girl was super chubby when she was a puppy now she is a lean mean 17 lbs and I would consider her a small Boston Terrier. My little man is 21 lbs and he was much smaller than our girl when he was a pup.  As far as cute facial features you lucked out. They are all the cutest damn things I have ever seen.  They are the best companion dogs ever, but you need to make sure they have an outlet for their endless energy."
BostonTerrier,332p4p,SingularOne,2,Mon Apr 20 16:22:57 2015 UTC,"Why not just look for an adult? My BT is a fully grown 14 lb female. We got her when she was 1 so we knew she was already done growing. We also had a weight limit of 15 lbs, but for apartment restriction reasons. The family we got her from said that she was a runt as a puppy but I wouldn't just go looking for a runt puppy on purpose."
BostonTerrier,332p4p,double-el,2,Tue Apr 21 20:47:36 2015 UTC,The best way to make sure you get a dog that is under 15 pounds when it is an adult is to adopt a <15 pound adult rescue.

We took him to the vet in the town we were visiting first thing the next morning and they did bloodwork, xrays. Said he had pancreatitis, gave us loads of medication, gave him something for the vomiting and some fluids. We left the vet to race home as he developed diharrea immediately before we left. About 45 minutes into the journey my wife reached back to pet him and he was cold. We got to our vets 10 minutes later and they said he was gone. They checked the bloodwork but couldn't see anything that suggested he was about to die.  In short, we have no idea, which is.... incredibly hard."

BostonTerrier,32mliy,franceshmr,2,Wed Apr 15 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar experience - I adopted a congenitally deaf, 10 month old Boston from a family that was voluntarily surrendering him due to financial difficulties.  He was completely unsocialized when he came to us, and in the 2 1/2 years since he joined our family here are some things I've picked up on:    This may be an obvious point, but my Boston Terrier is very easily surprised.  He can be a little jumpy, especially when woken up from a nap, and it's heartbreakingly easy to sneak up on him unintentionally.  I do my best to approach him from within his field of vision, and try to wake him with gentle petting.   I keep night lights in every room.  Deaf dogs are very heavily reliant on sight, and mine becomes totally frozen in place when all of the lights are out.  My Boston doesn't like having his head pet because it obscures his field of vision, so I stick to stroking his back, giving him belly rubs, and scratching his chin. You might want to consider purchasing a vibrating collar with a remote control.  Part of the difficulty in training a deaf pup, exactly like you said, is getting your Boston's attention.  You can train your pup to associate the collar vibration with your attention in a positive way by easing her in with treats whenever you push the button (my BT is very food motivated).  Eventually, she'll learn to look to you whenever the collar vibrates!  The particular model I purchased has 2 settings - 1 buzz and 3 buzzes.  I use the 3 buzz to let my Boston know that he's doing something he shouldn't, and he should stop immediately or else consequences.  The remote really comes in handy when my pup is out of arm's reach while on walks or in the park or whenever really! I'm not gonna sugar coat it - training was really tough.  It took a boatload of patience and repetition (seriously, a whole lot) before my Boston really started to pick up on commands, but now he's great with them!  We worked on training at the same time everyday, so there was less confusion as to what I was looking for from him.  As I mentioned previously, my pup is very visual and is extremely attune to facial cues, so I made exaggerated, happy gestures and faces whenever he responded correctly (I probably looked like an insane person).  My Boston loved the praising, petting, and general positive reinforcement, so he ate it right up.  If you decide to go with the vibrating collar, this would be a great way to keep your Boston's attention when you're working on commands.   Here's my bottom line: you do NOT suck at this.  In fact, you're a wonderful, incredible soul for finally giving this Boston a stable home!!  Her abandonment and hostility issues with other dogs may be a product of her time in foster homes, but that will slowly improve with your patience and care.  There will undoubtedly be many more frustrating experiences, but don't give up on her or yourself 'cause your awesome bond will be 100% worth it.  Hope this was helpful!

Sometimes she'll run full speed into walls or jump on the couch and flip. Just shakes it off and keeps going. Also, she gets accidentally kicked quite often (my wife and dog are both klutzes). She just keeps on going.  Oh, and once she jumped strangely from my hand and caught on me and landed flat on her (flat) face. Did that stop her? not even close.  Now, do be careful holding by the teeth. If they drop, they could (in theory) get hurt)"

Bronson destroyed it in two days time. He destroys anything plush, any rope, and fake animals, plastic, doesn't matter. Bronson destroys it all. I bought him a plastic crocodile I was told would help his teeth and he wouldn't destroy. He ate the croc's face, and pooped it up two days later.  Only toys he can't destroy are the Kong balls, but he doesn't really like them... because he can't destroy them. There was a set with a glow in the dark one that he really loved, but then he launched it off my balcony and it has not been recovered."
BostonTerrier,32id9a,flooddaga7,2,Tue Apr 14 14:42:43 2015 UTC,"That's how Archer is.  He guts plushes and eats the stuffing, pulls the fur off and eats it, chewed a hole through a tennis ball, chews pieces of off rope toys.  He zeros in on one little spot and constantly chews, going to that same spot every time he picks up the toy, until he destroys it."

BostonTerrier,32id9a,daxem2k,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:17:12 2015 UTC,You could also look for these Kong Wubbas. They've managed to last a long time (almost a year now).  Another type is these Skinneeez animals. My boston  really likes them and they usually last 6 months (give or take) since they don't have any stuffing.
BostonTerrier,32id9a,SmokyMonroe,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'll Have to take a look at the Wubbas.  Even if the Skineeez doesn't have stuffing, he pulls the fluff off and eat that."
BostonTerrier,32id9a,cmue02,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:15:39 2015 UTC,My Bostons take out the wubba in a few days. The older of the two gets so focused on removing the ball that it is all she can do until the ball is removed.
BostonTerrier,32id9a,mr-mumbles,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:51:34 2015 UTC,My dog is the same way and will destroy any toy that's isn't a nylabone. Right now he has three and we cycle them out each day for his crate time. The only other ones that doesn't destroy are rubber balls. Luckily he really loves chewing and doesn't mind just Nylabones. I only give him non Nylabone toys when I can supervise his chewing otherwise his white fluff poops stick to his bum ಠ_ಠ
BostonTerrier,32id9a,flooddaga7,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"Our Boston loves antlers. We typically stick to moose and haven't had any issues yet, our breeder and vet recommend them actually.   He also likes the Tuffy Toy brand which can usually last a few months."

There was a huge storm that blew through, and the flag got so wet and heavy that it bent the metal attachment it slid into on the concrete wall.  It was probably hanging six inches lower than it was before.  She rang the bell on the front door to go outside after the rain had passed...  And when I opened the door she flew through the air into the flag, grabbed it and yanked it still mid air, and was running around the front yard dragging it behind her before I could even comprehend what happened.

BostonTerrier,31vzjx,Angramis546,2,Thu Apr 9 05:40:10 2015 UTC,I get this look from my baby girl Athena all the time when I study for anything. She always wants to play and it is the most precious and annoying thing at the same time. It's only annoying when Athena tries to nudge my arm to pet her multiple times until I say 'fuck it' and start giving her belly rubs or just start throwing a ball around and play fetch. Only you can not get mad since they just want some loving and attention.
BostonTerrier,31xbrd,Herrpapps,2,Wed Apr 8 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"That's so funny, my friend's Boston has the exact same ball and it's her favourite as well :)"

BostonTerrier,31mq1s,Moghedien,3,Mon Apr 6 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"We found out that Jasper has Lens Luxation (http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/eyes/c_dg_lens_luxation) and he has to visit a specialist tomorrow.  Surgery can be expensive ($3200) and the other option is to have the eye removed.  It looks like  I may have to go with the second option :( Has anyone else dealt with this issue before, please post your results."
BostonTerrier,31mq1s,Iredditfromwork,2,Mon Apr 6 14:35:42 2015 UTC,i really need to get insurance for my girl. :(
BostonTerrier,31mq1s,Darkstrategy,2,Mon Apr 6 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"Our dog got cataracts when she was like 8, so very young. We decided to go with expensive cataract surgery, as we talked to a specialist and they said once they were removed it could never grow back due to an artificial lens.  Turns out that since Boston's are very susceptible to glaucoma this procedure also has a significant risk of triggering glaucoma. Her eye pressure started rising shortly after the procedure and soon enough her vision was degrading back to where it was with the cataracts.  Right now she's about 95% blind, one eye has shrunken (Which looks gross, but is actually good as the pressure in it isn't as much of an issue anymore) and the other eye bulges a bit and is susceptible to further damage if she smacks her head or anything like that.  Our eye specialist isn't a very good person in general. She nickels and dimes you to death, and she didn't properly inform us of the risks. The drops we have to put in her eyes every day are pretty expensive, and the bi-monthly visits to the eye doctor to check pressure are even more expensive. We don't really have a choice, though, as she's the only one in our area as it's apparently a rare specialization to become a veterinary optician. After all this we might still need to have the bulging eye removed if the pressure spikes, and it probably isn't comfortable for my doggy.  So when you go in for a consultation talk about the risks involved, including triggering glaucoma, and weigh what's best for your little buddy as well as your wallet. Thankfully it's only in one eye for your dog, so he should still retain vision. Good luck, and be informed in your decision."
BostonTerrier,31mq1s,dr8sides,2,Tue Apr 7 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"We adpoted a BT who developed this condition. The surgery isnt 100% successful and can have some nasty side effects (and in some cases the surgery when not successful will result in them having to remove the eye). They also told us that we could proceed with drops and checkups (every 3-4 months) to check pressure as an alternative to surgery. Unfortunately, we were in the adoption process, and the rescue that had ownership of her opted for the surgery. The operation went well, but she had to stay at the vet hospital for 3 days due to the high pressure in her eye post op. She  had inflammation and high pressure in the eye for 3 months post op. She needed drops 4-6 times a day (3 different drops) and had to wear a cone for the entire time. We would give her supervised time with the cone off, but she always wanted to scratch her eye. To further complicate matters, we have 2 other BTs, so her adjustment to our household was harder than it had to be due to the distress from the surgery and having to wear a cone.  She has since recovered, but we need to keep an eye (no pun intended) on her and watch for signs of glaucoma and inflammation. If given the chance, I would have opted to the try the drops only route first, if only to save her the stress and discomfort of the surgery and prolonged recovery.  If your BT needs the surgery, do it, but make sure you do your homework first."
BostonTerrier,31mq1s,tiny-e,3,Tue Apr 7 10:59:22 2015 UTC,Hope your little guy comes through okay whichever option you choose. He's adorable and going down an eye isn't going to change that.
BostonTerrier,31mq1s,ifulike_pinacolonics,2,Mon Apr 6 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"I want to thank you all for your input.  The information you provided has been very useful in my decision making.  I dropped him off at the specialist this morning and the doctor called me and said that she was able to ""push"" the lens back in place and will prescribe some drops that will keep his pupils constricted so that the lens will stay in place.  No surgery or eye removal!  We are very happy about this!  Will Update after his follow up visit next week."

BostonTerrier,3128qi,xordis,3,Thu Apr 2 12:13:07 2015 UTC,"It's called a ""Haggerty dot"" (or spot or star). Some people will say that it means that your dog is descended from an old breeder named Haggerty, but that's not necessarily true. It's just a variation in coloration, but many consider it to be desirable, like if you were designing the perfect Boston, it would have one. It's also sometimes called the angel's kiss."

The problem we have with the small ones is that they tend to get lost and scattered around our apartment.  On more than one occasion we've found one or more in our bed after sleeping.  Probably going to stick with big rawhides once our currently supply of small ones run out.  She's had the same big one for a few months now.  Much harder to lose."

BostonTerrier,30ui68,ljuvlig,2,Mon Mar 30 22:17:04 2015 UTC,It's a training harness to stop pulling. Like a gentle leader but for dogs without snouts. I got it at petsmart in the same section as gentle leaders.
BostonTerrier,30ui68,psykad,2,Tue Mar 31 02:43:32 2015 UTC,How well has it helped with pulling? I'm using the Gentle Leader on one of our BTs (she has a long enough snout) and it has worked very well at keeping her focused on me during our walks.

But he started getting gnarly eye boogers and those brown tear spots under his eyes. I just recently switched to the Kirkland Signature Natures Domain which was recommended to me over at /r/dogs. It's grain free and they have different protein options, plus it's a great price. He seems to really like it so far."

A tip to share with you, get baby onesies ready. They're handy if you don't want an accidental pregnancy when she goes to the dog park/playing with other dogs if she's not spayed. The onesies are excellent when she starts her first heat.   You put the onesies on just like you do with a baby only make a hole for her tail.   Welcome to the world of BTs, Aell23!

BostonTerrier,30snya,knylok,3,Mon Mar 30 11:19:50 2015 UTC,I at first had my pups crate in the bathroom and would put him in his crate around 9pm when he would fall asleep by me. I would then wake myself up every 2-3 hours for a couple weeks and would take him out and give him a little treat outside. Around 10-11 weeks of age I started taking him out at 9 then 3 and then 7 when I would wake up. Around 12-13 weeks I would take him out at 1130 and then he would last until 7 in the morning but I moved the crate to my bed room. Now (15 weeks) he sleeps in my bed and cuddles with me all night and doesn't really move and hasn't had one accident. Last night he made it from 10:15 to 7:30. Just have a schedule and stick to it and slowly increase the time and always reward for good behavior is what I have experienced.

BostonTerrier,30orqy,knife_at_a_gun_fight,4,Sun Mar 29 10:03:41 2015 UTC,"Bostons absolutely should come in pairs, always! They need that other Boston friend.   My wife used to work with breeders a lot, mainly show dogs. So she has bee  around hundreds of BTs. Her advice is to either have multiple males. Or one female and any amount of males. The females tend to be a bit more bossy and don't always get along with each other. (not that they can't, but think of two bossy people interacting all day).   We have a boy and  girl and they are great together and with our daughter."
BostonTerrier,30orqy,jcsharp,5,Sun Mar 29 15:03:13 2015 UTC,The best thing we ever did was get a boy companion for our girl boston. They are about a year apart and ate absolutely in love. She is the happiest she has ever been and it is all because of him.
BostonTerrier,30orqy,Ranger5052,6,Sun Mar 29 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the other posters.  Getting a second Boston was the best thing we could have done for both of them.  They hit it off immediately - literally within the first 5 minutes upon meeting. Currently they're wrestling with each other - which they will do until exhaustion, and then collapse on the couch on top of each other and nap until dinner time.  They do everything together. As much attention as we gave (which was a TON), i dont think I or my wife could possibly have given our first Boston as much time or excercise as shes getting now.   For reference, our Boston's are 2.5yrs (female) and 1.5yrs (male).  We got our second Boston just after our first turned 1.  I dont have experience with other male/female combos but I have heard from breeders and other dog handlers that male/male and male/female combos are generally more successful than female/female."
BostonTerrier,30orqy,freezermink,5,Sun Mar 29 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Agree with the others, BTs are best in pairs. I have a male and female (brother and sister) and they couldn't be happier together. They are best buds and love playing, snuggling and keeping the back yard squirrel free."

It gives everyone a chance to have what they need.. one needs a break and two want to play.. have at it!   My first Boston was such a spoiled prince that I was shocked how well he welcomed Boston number two after five years. Boston number three came a few years later but turned out to be the oldest of the bunch. They take turns playing, snoozing, and snuggling. All three sleep in the same HUGE box at night. There's no real competition for leader of the pack... just a bunch of Bros hanging out.  I worried adding pups would change the tone of the house significantly, and it did.. but they are better and happier for it. Best of luck!"

BostonTerrier,30jtdr,BraveLittleToastGirl,3,Sat Mar 28 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"He was just diagnosed with Cushing's Disease.   Two weeks ago we took him to our vet who diagnosed him w a hot spot.  We didn't agree but gave him the meds. Two days later he was getting worse, so we took him to an emergency clinic who agreed it was a hot spot and instructed us to continue w the prescribed meds and told us it would look worse before it got better. If it didn't clear up after the meds were complete, we would need to get a biopsy. Throughout the week,  it got out of control. By Saturday, we were gravelly concerned as the ""hot spot"" was leaking puss and smelled rotten, but we couldn't go back to the emergency clinic as they don't have a dermatologist on staff. On Monday, we made an appointment with our vet. At the appointment, the vet diagnosed him with panniculitus and told us that if we did nothing,  he would die.  The only course of treatment was a servere steroid and severe antibiotic, the potency of which could kill him but it was our only option. By Wednesday, the area had spread from the back of his neck to under his chin and up to the back of his head. We called the vet who scheduled us for Thursday afternoon. On Thursday, the vet's office called us and said that we needed to see an internal medicine specialist at the emergency clinic. The specialist suspected Cushing's and made us an emergency appointment for first thing this morning. We still have to get more testing done next week, but I'm so glad my buddy is with us for a few more days. If it is a tumor instead of a pituitary issue, things will get complicated.  Let's hope for the best for my little Odin boy!"

BostonTerrier,30efe4,Cootys,2,Thu Mar 26 18:32:01 2015 UTC,I cannot believe you are endangering the life of a dog like that. Boston Terriers are a complete treasure and you obviously do not deserve that beautiful pup.  We are coming to get that cute little baby right now. She will be much happier with our family that does not risk that poor little Bo's life!!! ;)

BostonTerrier,30db9t,CorporateGranola,2,Thu Mar 26 19:25:40 2015 UTC,Any idea what she's mixed with? My girlfriend has a Boston mix that looks VERY similar.
BostonTerrier,30db9t,CorporateGranola,2,Wed Apr 1 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"She's mixed with a pug, and possibly something else. Our vet seems to think she might also have some boxer in her. I sometimes think she has a bit of pitty in her (when she smiles, it's reminiscent of a pitbull)"
BostonTerrier,30db9t,fekitall,2,Thu Apr 2 12:28:13 2015 UTC,We are pretty sure Vinnie is a Boston/Boxer mix.  The resemblance to yours is uncanny.  http://i.imgur.com/NmNOcnX.jpg

I think we are going to go with Toki, as in Toki Wartooth. We chose Bukowski for the first dog because he's one of both of our favorite authors. One of our favorite cartoons is Metalocalypse, and we love Toki's passion and innocence. We also find it fun giving our girls male names."

BostonTerrier,30bno6,storebot,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"BTs get along quite well with each other regardless of gender. They share the similar traits in personality which helps a lot with adding a new dog. It also helps that the male is neutered and you plan to spay the female. A tip to share if I could, use a baby's onesie for the female puppy when she is in heat. This is much easier than puppy pads, IMHO. Use the onesie when you take the female puppy out before she is spayed. Put the onesie on like you do with a baby, make a hole for the tail. Hope this helps and have lots of fun with the new addition. I'm envious! ;)"

BostonTerrier,2zukq0,WuTangGraham,-3,Sun Mar 22 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"That shot glass made me laugh a little too hard. It also makes me think of a funny story about my Boston, Trader, which you all now have to listen to.  So, my sidekick and I were united about 9 years ago. I liberated him from a not so great household. The first night I had him, the first thing he did was run up to me on the couch, lick my face, and then throw up all over me. We've been inseparable ever since.   So, a few months in, I find out that this bar near my house, The Shamrock, not only allowed dogs but encouraged them. They actually had dog bowls behind the bar. I started taking him with me (because face it, Boston Terriers are total chick magnets), and from time to time he would start barking at people that would randomly come up to talk to me. He was my bouncer. I also found out that The Shamrock would serve your dog alcohol, which had a tendency to lighten Trader's mood (and mine). So, I would sit there and drink Guinness and Jameson, while Trader would have a small shot of Glenlivet mixed into his water. He would actually sit on the bar stool next to me, we would watch sports, drink whiskey, and Trader would ""screen"" anyone that tried to talk to me.  Right now, he's got his head on my lap and I'm typing this with one hand so I can scratch his belly with my other hand. No matter what life has thrown at us, he's been my most loyal companion from the day we met. He's lived in a big house, in luxury apartments, and in my car with me. No matter what has happened, he always sleeps right next to me, and no matter how many times he wakes me up in the middle of the night, I wouldn't trade it for the world."
BostonTerrier,2zukq0,WuTangGraham,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:28:16 2015 UTC,"I know that now, which is why I don't do it anymore. This was quite a few years ago."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,thebeatniq,9,Sat Mar 21 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"Positive reinforcement works best with Bostons in my experience. So as far as simple commands (sit, stay, come, etc) treats work great. When you have something they want to eat, you are the center of their universe. It might take a while for them to understand what you want them to do, but be patient they're smart dogs.   As far as the destructive behavior goes, it just varies from dog to dog. I've had 2 Bostons that never destroyed anything more than their Pee Pads and 2 others that chewed/shredded anything they could find. You just have to do as much puppy proofing as possible to minimize damage.   If I caught them in the act of tearing something up, a loud and stern ""NO"" usually got the point across. If I found the aftermath I just ignored the dog completely while I cleaned it up. That doesn't sound like it would do anything, but it would devastate them to not be acknowledged, especially after they tore something up and were acting guilty. Then when I came home to a non torn-up house, typical greetings were given and happy dances ensued. After a few weeks, most if not all of their destructive tendencies went away.  Every Boston is different but these general guidelines have worked for me over 3 generations of Bostons and I doubt I'll ever have any other type of dog.   Hope this helps"
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,everettdc,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:58:44 2015 UTC,I wish my boston liked treats. When we go to the dog park I make her sit (almost impossible to get her to do) and give her a treat. She'll sniff it and leave.   This happened to her the other day ;-(  It looks like she is having a seizure.  https://youtu.be/V3isblyKxzM It's the forth time I've seen. I recorded it to show the vet on our check up that's coming up. This is her after she's feeling better. She's walking funny with her hind legs though.  https://youtu.be/ZP5Z6xx12OI  My frenchie on the other hand will drop everything run right at me for any amount of food.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,6,Sat Mar 21 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a seizure. I'm epileptic and that's how I look when I seize. I guess it could be different in a dog, but probably not. Get her to the vet. It can probably be controlled pretty well with meds. I'm sorry she has to go through that, but it's good she has you for a parent. Lots of love."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,PhilipkWeiner,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:51:16 2015 UTC,Okay thank you. The first time it happened it was over a year ago and it looked like she was a heat stroke since it was hot and she was breathing heavy. But they are starting to happen more frequently. Currently only a few months apart. I'll take her to the vet today after work.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,2,Sat Mar 21 20:08:05 2015 UTC,Growing up I had a Boston that was epileptic due to her diet. Put her on a specific brand of food and made sure she ate it and we were able to almost eleliminate the seizures. They didn't come back until she was nearly 10.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,Skitten1203,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:46:09 2015 UTC,This is what we feed her.   Pedigree adult.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,2,Thu Mar 26 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"Seizures hurt. Most people don't realize that.  They also carry a heavy mental toll like loss of memory, mood swings and depression. Do whatever you can to minimize them even if it's using heavy medications including sedatives."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,PhilipkWeiner,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:42:17 2015 UTC,I'm gonna defiantly take her ASAP. She's to young and healthy to be in this kinda pain. Luckily the seizures don't last too long. But not at all is better.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:44:48 2015 UTC,If she has another one what are should I be doing? Should I keep her somewhere soft and just comfort her by petting?
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,2,Sat Mar 21 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"As a human I prefer space since ""waking up"" is an extremely jarring experience. I've had more seizures than I can count and yet I still go into fight mode if someone is in my face when I'm coming to. Like I seriously believe I've been attacked and was knocked out and have to defend myself. However it's extremely important to make sure her head is protected since she can do a lot of damage while convulsing. It's different for everybody and I'm no expert especially since it's your dog. I hope I've helped a little bit though."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,PhilipkWeiner,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:19:21 2015 UTC,Okay thanks. I'll ask the vet if I have anymore questions. She dosent seem combative when or after. But project the head. Got it. Thanks Man.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,2,Sat Mar 21 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"When Fry has them and I'm around I try to keep his head still, and just talk soothingly to him. Don't stick your hand near her mouth because you will get bit. I normally try to hold him in my lap if possible, and don't let him fall off of things. He's always confused for awhile afterwards, and sometimes his personality changes for a couple of days afterwards. He's only 9 months, and his seizures started at 6 months. He still has them even on all of his medicine though."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,everettdc,2,Sun Mar 22 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"All of my Bostons have been picky eaters. None of them have ever seemed to like any type of Milk Bone. The two I have now love this organic chicken jerkey treat I found at my pet store. I just break the jerkey into little pieces and use it like treats. Anything with peanut butter in it also seems work well.  Epilepsy is fairly common in Bostons unfortunately. As a breed Boston's also are more susceptible to breathing problems, allergies, and overheating.  My sisters Boston suffered from seizures and ultimately had one bad enough that his retinas detached making him blind. If you can afford the medication for her, absolutely get it. There is nothing worse than having to sit there and watch your dog go through something like that while being powerless to help them.   That's a beautiful girl you have there, she looks happy in the second video. Also I've never seen a brindle frenchie, very cool."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,damcgee,2,Sat Mar 21 22:56:38 2015 UTC,That's what my boston does as well. Most of the time it's a lot worst. You need to get her to the vet asap.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:24:37 2015 UTC,"Our 6 yr old boston female (Libby) has had seizures for about four years.   Our vet told us that the treatment for seizures is based on  1. How long they last and  2. How often they happen.   The vet said that since Libby's seizures last less than five minutes and happen less than once per month, he believes that her quality of life is better WITHOUT medication. If the seizures increase in duration and/or frequency, then he will recommend medication.   When Libby has a seizure, we rub her neck/back gently and speak softly and reassuringly. I don't see any signs that she is in pain during the events, but she is clearly nervous during them."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,kenaam,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"My Boston ( Tea Tea, named after the boston tea party) she has only had 4 that I know of. I do go to school AND work so she could have them when I'm not home. The first on lasted a long time. The other  not so much. But she does it very frightened, and her eyes water and look weird. She always looks right at me when they happen. I always speak softly and pet her( not for those 30 secs though.)  I'll talk to the vet on Monday."
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,3,Sun Mar 22 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"Yes - our guy is also of the super destructive type.  We have lost countless pillows cushions, duvets, parts of sofas etc in the early days!  When we catch him destroying something he shouldn't a stern NO and redirection to something he is allowed to chew (nylabon, stag bar etc) eventually got him to stop.  Plus another tip - if you do have a word for 'no' don't shot his name first - confuses the hell outta them!  Agree with other poster - if we found something destroyed after the event there was no point giving him into trouble - was too late - but completely ignored while cleaning it up.  Hes almost 3 now and no more issues with destruction.  Good Luck!"
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,kenaam,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:21:33 2015 UTC,Same issues with mine. 3 years old seems like the golden age where they calm down enough to not eat everything in sight. And the training seems to click.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,MyNamesRocco,3,Sat Mar 21 19:42:45 2015 UTC,Also - how much exercise is he getting - some bostons are real high energy - not getting enough of a walk might lead him to seek other ways to burn it off?
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,2,Sat Mar 21 19:25:32 2015 UTC,My girl gets walks all the time but she still runs laps around the house at night.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,ekatya,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:23:05 2015 UTC,This. I take mine dogs to the dog park everyday. It's their favorite. And they will be calm for about 2-4 hours.
BostonTerrier,2ztov6,HD_ERR0R,1 point,Sat Mar 21 19:43:57 2015 UTC,Fry gets to play outside for a couple of hours every day and inside the rest of the time. I can't leave him out to long because he over heats and then ends up having a seizure later that day.

This was the first girl who has legitimately made me cry upon picking her up since she is not in the best of health.  At ~2 years old, she was kept outside in the yard and has a pretty serious heartworm infection that has caused a heart murmur and she also suffers from severe malnourishment.  We're not sure how much recovery she'll make, but she's the sweetest baby and can't wait to try and get her weight up and health as good as it can be over the next few months!"

BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,SrirachaChan,3,Thu Mar 19 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yay! Congrats! Bt's are the best! My girl is old now, but when she was a young pup she had so much energy. It took me a while to figure out that she needed a nice long walk everyday, sometimes two. That made a huge difference for us! Good luck! Also check out r/puppy101"
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,Helloellyse,3,Fri Mar 20 00:41:08 2015 UTC,"They're very smart, energetic, and goofy as fuck. Invest in training treats and lots of toys. My old girl is 8 and she still keeps up with me when I take her running. She tends to be independent when we're at home relaxing. I LOVE having a Boston, she's a handful but she's the best dog I have ever had."
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,hgrebed,2,Fri Mar 20 04:03:24 2015 UTC,At what age did you start running with your BT? And how far do you two usually run together? I'm planning on running with mine.
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,hgrebed,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"About a year ago, she was about 7 give or take. She can typically go about a mile and a half without too much trouble. Her energy level is never an issue, sometimes So Cal weather gets to be too hot for her. When it's warmer I'll stop under a tree for a few minutes to let her cool down a bit. If it's cool in the mornings or after dusk she can run longer."
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,rebelreligion,2,Fri Mar 20 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"I have a seven month old red Boston.  She's the smartest dog I have ever had.  Easy to potty train, easy everything except sit.  She's funny and loving; amuses herself when I'm busy.  Best to you and your new pup!"
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,tehoose,2,Fri Mar 20 03:26:53 2015 UTC,"So, I read your question as less about what BTs are like and more about how to pick a puppy.  I was told by a breeder friend that you should roll them onto their back to see how they react. We didn't do that with ours, but we did do the typical tests, e.g., pulling at their toes and other mild annoyances.  But more than that, we just picked them all up and paid attention to how they played with each other. Ours didn't shiver in fear or nip at us when we picked her up and cradled her, and she grew up to be a prolific snuggler. Also, she was very independent when she played; she loved playing with her toys and her littermates, but she also loved exploring all corners of the room even before she learned how to walk that well. Nowadays, she's still a very inquisitive dog that loves to explore.  So I guess just spend time with them and watch closely. You'll be able to tell a lot."
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,doubleflusher,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a good thread from a couple months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonTerrier/comments/2vz3bl/is_a_boston_terrier_right_for_me/  Generally speaking, temperament in BTs will match yours. BTs play hard and snuggle hard. If you are a couch potato, your BT will most likely also be a couch potato.   Tough to say how temperament is in puppies. As a general rule, puppies should get used to a variety of things when they're young. Our breeder lived on a farm and there were other animals (cats, horses, rabbits and pigs) always around. So bring your new BT around people, kids, animals, water, cars, toys, etc. This will lessen the chance of your BT getting scared of things when he/she is an adult (my male BT hates fans; won't go near them).  One last thing: BTs are notorious for snoring, burping and farting. So get used to it. As always, please show off (post pics) your new puppy when you pick him/her up. Congrats!"
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,fattymcgigglepants,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:18:10 2015 UTC,"Every dog is unique in their own way. I would start crate training from day 1. Chester is almost a year old now so we finally let him sleep in our bed about half the time now, but he views his crate as his home. Never treat the crate as a punishment. For the first few months we gave him treats and praise every time he went in.   I have trained and raised several dogs and Bostons are by far the smartest and easiest to train in my experience. Like everyone has said, they are VERY smart and sensitive at the same time. Positive reinforcement. Always remember you are their ENTIRE world, so when you scold them or are upset with them their world is shattered, but it is necessary sometimes.   Get on a schedule and stick with it for a long time in order to make a routine. Every morning weekday or weekend Chester wakes up with me and goes potty outside, eats and drinks and goes back to sleep. He gets fed everyday at 0500 and 1630. Dogs absolutely need a schedule. While they are puppies don't give them the opportunity to potty in the house. We were taking Chester out to potty at least every hour until he was 15 weeks and praised him and loaded him with treats every time he pottied outside. I never used pee pads. They are counterproductive because the attractant in them teaches the dog it's okay to potty inside.   Good luck and enjoy the farts!"
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,ZZBC,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:05:16 2015 UTC,"They're extremely smart, sometimes too smart for their own good.  Our little guy is more of a barker than most Bostons, but he's grown out of it a bit.  He is an avid chewer and goes through toys extremely quickly.  We can no longer give him stuffed toys, even the ballistic nylon ones, because he always find the exact same spot on the seem to chew and gets to the stuffing.  He is extremely affectionate and wants to be where we are, he's a big cuddled.  Also a BIG licker.  Nothing makes him happier than catching you by surprise and licking inside your mouth or in your ear.  He's either running and playing, chewing, or snuggling."
BostonTerrier,2zn4gi,LoveandBonor,-1,Sat Mar 28 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"Just don't give her or him toys, he or she wants to play with you! A chew bone is great but playing tug-o-war with you is so much better. I would watch my good shoes for a couple of years too, they are too yummy. My girl loves the warmth of people too, so be prepared to have company on the couch if you allow that."

I would definetly recommend consulting a vet about the risks associated, especially since you haven't gotten the pup yet. However, my experience so far has been fine (and hopefully continues to be so!). don't know if that helps."

With the estimated cost of about $4000 for the surgery and the fact that she has a good life quality despite bumping her nose here and there, we decided to not go through a costly and risky surgery."

BostonTerrier,2ynqe4,StrikingStrider,2,Wed Mar 11 08:24:56 2015 UTC,Mine tend to get uncomfortable on walks after about 80 degrees.  Usually won't do more than 45 minutes with them.  At 90 it's pretty rough.  15 minutes or so.  Different dogs may have different tolerances.   My boy has a slightly longer snout and can handle it a little better.

BostonTerrier,2ynqe4,daemionx,2,Wed Mar 11 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"I live in Southern California so not nearly as hot - our dog can handle about 6 miles of semi-strenuous hiking if it's ""chilly"" (50 degrees) and even more distance on a simple walk. If it's 90 outside, she can only do maybe 2 miles before she starts trying to lay down in every shady spot she sees, though.  EDIT: This is something we built up to - she could barely walk down the block when we first got her. Now I take her running about 15 miles a week."

BostonTerrier,2yadon,ragingbusch,3,Sat Mar 7 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I brought Loki in to get neutered and the Dr took a blood sample because his gums were pale(they have been noticeably pale but I didn't think anything of it because he is so active and happy) and they found out his red blood cell count is at 13.9% and after further examination, he has a count of 14 (normal is 30-60). The vet thinks it is a hookworm and gave us a de wormer. He took his second dose 2 hours ago and he vomited an hour after he took it. I called the emergency system and they said to keep an eye on him and if he starts acting abnormal to bring him in, but I'm so worried.   Positive words encouraged. He is such a good dog and we've only had him about a month. Thoughts and prayers would be great!"
BostonTerrier,2yadon,SnZ001,4,Sat Mar 7 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"If he's 5 months old, then he likely wasn't born with them, and may have picked them up outside from the soil somewhere(hookworms are usually found in moist soil, or in feces from another animal with hookworms).  When we let Carly out into the back yard, we often have a tough time trying to keep her from sniffing, rolling around and pretending she's an anteater with everything she encounters.  She frequently comes in contact with a lot of grass & dirt, and she'll invariably decide to try to eat just about anything she finds in it that she doesn't think is big enough to try to eat her first.  We try to keep our yard clean and pick up after her as much as possible, but you can only do so much to control nature.  Hookworm eggs are usually ingested, but mature hookworms in soil or feces can also penetrate skin, so having a Boston Hoover that loves to interact with everything outside can make things rather challenging. (Side note: If you have a yard, you'll definitely want to clear his potty area now that he's getting treatment, so that after this is over, he hopefully doesn't come in contact with any larvae that he may have already passed.)      Hookworms can be much more serious with young puppies, because their little immune systems aren't fully developed yet, but the good news is that they're usually very curable, the dewormer is almost always effective(just be very careful not to overdose, as even a little too much of that stuff can be fatal, esp. for a puppy), and Loki's prognosis is much better than it would be if he were a newborn/infant puppy who got infected via placental blood or his mother's milk(and even those cases are very curable, if caught early).  Also, if he wasn't exhibiting any severe symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss, weakness/fatigue or vomiting(before taking the dewormer, anyway), then chances are good that the larvae haven't even fully matured or left his intestines yet, and so they should be easier to get and stay rid of.  In any case, your vet will likely advise you to repeat the treatment course in about 10 days.  This is important because if the hookworms have matured and left the intestinal tract, some of them will embed themselves into other tissues in the body and then lie dormant.  The first course of dewormer will usually kill the worms, larvae and eggs in the bloodstream and/or intestines, but will not necessarily kill all of the embedded larvae.   What it will do, though, is trigger those larvae to come out from the tissue and try to go about their reproductive process - and so they'll try to travel back to the intestines, which is where the second course comes along and makes sure those are killed off, too.  I know it all sounds like pretty scary business, but worms happen, especially with active & inquisitive breeds.  With proper treatment, he should come through just fine.  Hoping for the best for your little guy!"
BostonTerrier,2yadon,drewjamesSB,1 point,Sun Mar 8 04:24:42 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your words of wisdom! My wife and I feel so much better about it now. I will keep posted.

I think he's got a half marathon in him, but won't take him farther than that.  Such a good little dog, and so much positive energy.  He also gets along great with Violet (my 4 year old Boston)."
BostonTerrier,2xlr18,Joobug,2,Sun Mar 1 22:16:39 2015 UTC,BTROTC... Great organization :-) Donated and voted!
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,coreystang85,8,Sun Mar 1 14:59:28 2015 UTC,"His kennel might be too big for him; he should just have enough space to get in and turn around. It sounds like a bit of separation anxiety if he's just started doing it at night when he's physically separated from you, especially if he's stepping in his own mess. Could he be picking up on/getting a little less attention with a new baby coming?   I think more vigilance and positive reinforcement is the key here for a little while. When you let him out, say the same word to him like ""outside"" (or my dad says ""get busy"") every single time, stay with him while he's outside, and as soon as he potties give him a treat every single time he finishes in the proper place. If he potties inside, don't say anything or make a fuss about cleaning up the mess. If you see him sniffing around and preparing to potty in the house, clap your hands or whatever to halt him and repeat your  code word - ""Ep ep ep! Outside!"" and hustle him out the door. He should soon learn to associate going ""outside"" with praise and going in the house with ziltch and start indicating to you when he needs to go."
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,hereImadethisforyou,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"He was in a kennel that was big enough for all of dogs, but we recently bought him a kennel big enough for just him and he's still doing it.   He also knows ""outside"" very well. But he doesn't always poop out here. Regardless of its just him or our other dogs outside with him."
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,cchloe,3,Sun Mar 1 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with hereimadethisforyou. It's really really important at the beginning and you should always go outside with him and wait until he does his business even if he insists to go back in. Bostons can be really stubborn and have an ""I do what I want, when I want"" attitude so it's important to stand there and be like ""Nope! We're out here for you to do your business and we're not going back in until you do!""   Once he does both #1 and #2 you can give a treat inside and give the positive reinforcement. He has to associate going outside in the morning with doing his business. He also might not have associated going outside yet with anything more than sniffing around for 10 minutes."
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,myblanketiswarm,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"The kennel should only have space big enough for him to sleep. No walking space. Dogs do not want to poop where they sleep. The bigger the space, the more likely he'll poop. We had to cut our kennel in half when our Boston was a puppy. Not literally. We just placed a piece of cardboard and books to cover half of it!"
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,tambot5000,4,Mon Mar 2 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"our little bt had a relapse with pooping in the house when he got to be around 1, as well. we started taking him out separately from our other one so that there would be no distractions and giving him lots of positive reinforcement with treats when he pooped outside. we also eliminated his mid-day poop so that he would have to go when he was out for his last potty before bed. also, if your kennel came with a barrier to make it smaller and he is not too big, you can use that to limit the space he has to move around once he is in there. mine won't poop unless he can turn around 3-4 times first. it took a couple of months, but winston never has accidents in the house anymore. hope this helps!"
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,ljuvlig,2,Sun Mar 1 15:35:42 2015 UTC,Check out the sidebar of /dogtraining. There is a potty training guide there.
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,shubrick,2,Sun Mar 1 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"What is your climate like? I've got two bostons, and one is incredibly averse to rain. The other to cold.   I'd agree that you may need to start over and be much more vigilant, and use more positive reinforcement for any and all good pooping behavior. I also wonder about the crate size and whether the puppy is the only dog that gets the crate. And I assume the pup enters the crate willingly?  ie it's not forced in?"
BostonTerrier,2xkbhn,mattyparanoid,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:11:52 2015 UTC,We're in St Pete florida. And he will go into the crate willingly if my wife asks. If I do I have to pick him up (he hides from me) and I put him at the door and he'll go in then.   The kennel is big enough for him only.

For those of you with Boston Terriers - who are ALL adorable - and curious how Cash became their 'model' - he simply followed their page on Instagram and when they posted a 'casting call' for BTs we reached out via the email address in the ad.   Cash really does love the hoodie. He also has a hoodie from American Apparel - lower quality - and outside of the ear covering, the major difference is that even though cash is a boy, he squats to pee - and he frequently pees on his American Apparel hoodie. The Snorf Industries hoodie has a cut out that makes it nearly impossible to pee on. I believe the Snorf Industries hoodie for female dogs has a longer covering - since they don't shoot forward (as much?).

These dogs are wonderful therapy, though. I was depressed and withdrawn due to a combination of issues in grad school, but ever since I got my guys, I'm walking every morning, I'm talking to people, and just feel like a better person."
BostonTerrier,2wty1r,ekatya,2,Mon Feb 23 17:55:00 2015 UTC,I freaking loved Feast! It makes me wish I could adopt a Boston even more.
BostonTerrier,2wty1r,ekatya,2,Mon Feb 23 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Aww, you'll get your Boston eventually! What's holding you back, if I may ask? There's a lot of good rescues that could set you up with a friendly, hungry little furbaby in no time!"
BostonTerrier,2wty1r,Radiate_your_balls,2,Mon Feb 23 04:16:43 2015 UTC,I can't find any shelters within my area that have Boston's up for adoption.

BostonTerrier,2wubew,Silentvelcro2,3,Mon Feb 23 05:14:20 2015 UTC,The worst part is when you actually hear it.
BostonTerrier,2wubew,PanicHouse,2,Mon Feb 23 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"The worst ones with my Boston terrier are the ones that are almost completely silent. She'll be sleeping, and you hear a little whispery ""poot"", and she wakes up suddenly, turns her head with a look of alarm at her own butt, then gets up and walks out of the room to escape her own stink-cloud. Seriously, they smell the worst. Hehe. I laugh, but it's repugnant."

BostonTerrier,2wh3bu,fattymcgigglepants,2,Fri Apr 17 18:01:00 2015 UTC,I read your comment and thought the exact same thing until rechecked and I noticed someone in the background.
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,cockontherocks,7,Fri Feb 20 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there were only two things I had to do in my apartment for my dog. The first was to put carpet down somewhere. My entire apartment is fake wood linoleum, and he doesn't like it. So I have two rugs on the floor where he can get some traction to chew on his toys and play tug of war without slipping and sliding all over the place.  And the other thing... This may be TMI, but it's legitimately something I hadn't thought of before, and it never would normally have crossed my mind. I had to get a bathroom trashcan with a lid. He was constantly getting into the bathroom garbage and eating used tampons, which was super gross, and then either throwing them up (SUPER GROSS) or pooping them out and them getting stuck halfway through (SO SUPER GROSS).   So, lid."
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,NinjaShira,3,Fri Feb 20 04:59:51 2015 UTC,"Oh god I second this. We don't have any bins out, they are all in cupboards for this very reason"
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,coconanas,2,Fri Feb 20 06:18:17 2015 UTC,"Similarly, dogs like dirty laundry, so lid or closed closet."
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,sarahelyse,2,Fri Feb 20 10:58:04 2015 UTC,Yup - lost too many pairs of underwear to dogs chewing holes.
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,emalen,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:46:53 2015 UTC,Thank you! That's exactly the kind of advice I'm looking for - stuff you don't even think of until the dog gets into it. lol!
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,coconanas,3,Fri Feb 20 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"I recommend heading over to /r/puppy101 and checking out the sidebar for advice on puppies... Even if you're  getting an adult dog the advice there helps with setting everything up before your dog arrives. /r/dogtraining is also great.  Things I wish I had been more prepared on is clicker training, crate training, and diet (we went through hell trying to find food for my boston terrier as he was picky and highly allergic). He's on K9 natural now which is a New Zealand brand and has turned his skin from an itchy mess to calm normal skin!  Make sure you have toys so you can redirect chewing easily. Get puzzle toys id your dog is home a lot to keep them thinking.  As the other comment suggested getting mats / rugs if you've only got hard floors is good...you can train the dog to go to the mat to keep them out of the way when you're cooking or other times you need space or to get them out of the way.  It's so exciting getting a new dog so have fun!"
BostonTerrier,2wihr9,BraveLittleToastGirl,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:27:39 2015 UTC,"When I first got Maddie I lived in a loft with concrete floors and she didn't seem to mind them at all. In fact, she'd kinda run and slide and see how far she could go lol! Now we're in an apartment with some carpeted areas and she likes to show off how she can turn on a dime when she gets all crazy running around. The two things you'll need (which aren't so much safety issues but are definites for a Boston) are a bed space in front of the heater vent and their very own blanket for making nests/caves."
BostonTerrier,2wegy6,jackjackh,3,Thu Feb 19 05:33:42 2015 UTC,Well isn't she pretty!
BostonTerrier,2wgwa7,knylok,2,Thu Feb 19 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"Wait until you're sure you need boots before buying them. If you need them, you can try them on in the store. If you don't need them, then you're saving money. This is coming from someone who bought a bunch of rarely/never used puppy items."
BostonTerrier,2wgwa7,sarahelyse,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:25:15 2015 UTC,Good point.  I will keep that in mind.

BostonTerrier,2wgwa7,NinjaShira,1 point,Fri Feb 20 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"I recently went to Colorado over Christmas Break with my Boston, and instead of boots (which I'm pretty sure he would have hated), I got Musher's Secret. It's waxy stuff you put on his feet before you go out in the snow. It's totally safe if he starts licking at it, and it keeps the ice or salt from hurting his little paws. It did the job well, even on longer walks. The other dog in our party had red, tender pads after being outside for a while, but my dog's feet were totally okay. After that, we started using the Musher's Secret on both of them, and they were happy as clams.  I think it's awesome, and it avoids the hassle of getting the right size boots or losing a boot or your dog realizing he hates boots and refuses to walk in them, or outgrowing them as he gets older.
