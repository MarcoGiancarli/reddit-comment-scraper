Yes, some subs will be banned. But are we really better off with subs where you can talk about raping people and encourage people to rape others? The third NSFW opt-in category of content will do a lot to hide away the nasty portions of the site without censoring them, and I think this is a great move. Straightening out the Content Policy will allow users and mods to determine more easily and clearly what is allowed content and what is not."

The only thing which mattered to reddit was the mods going on strike - which was directly caused by Victoria's firing and wasn't even against Pao specifically.

She is anti-expression, pro-censorship and will intentionally deceive (and not even try hard to disguise it) to justify her agenda. She is an authoritarian, she clearly explained that she believes that it is okay to censor anyone whose ideas she doesn't like because some people are ""harassed"" online, and because of this it is justified to censor anyone who is not directly involved.  ""Harassment"" in Pao's definition includes ""being called an offensive name"" or having someone ""try to embarrass you intentionally"" (not surprisingly these two categories make up almost all so-called harassment online). Nothing we have learned since Pao was run out has indicated that the backlash against her was unjustified (and her own words confirm literally everything she was hated for), if anything it shows that the Reddit board of directors is just as much in favor of censorship as Pao. Fuck them all.  Edit: Added link to Pao's WT article."

Pao already had a bad reputation because of her BS sex discrimination lawsuit, her scam-artist husband, and other SJW garage like banning salary negotiations in the company.

The reaction by the Reddit community was understandable given Pao's previous reputation and was not inappropriate at all (I'm not saying that there weren't some people that went over the line, but the general outrage was absolutely appropriate and was directed appropriately).  If she really was just a puppet, and the board was really making all these decisions that apparently went against her will, then the board is the only one to blame, not the Reddit user base.

Thats clearly SJW logic. This is where I would say ""the most qualified person should get the job"" but someone would probably say I triggered them or that this statement is somehow sexist. What an absolute joke."
PaoYongYang,3dcufb,IvanDenisovitch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the motivation behind the admins. Things were running just fine, Reddit was growing and becoming larger and larger and succeeding in just about every way. Then all of a sudden they decide to implement these new policies, piss off the users, and their response, ""If you don't like it then leave."" It's like they don't even care."
PaoYongYang,3dcufb,reversememe,2,Wed Jul 15 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"You're sweet, but utterly out of touch with the exigencies of a workable revenue-model in Silicon Valley.  Reddit has such a pressing challenge in generating revenue without alienating its audience that the phenomenon is now known as ""The Reddit Problem."""
PaoYongYang,3dcufb,De1WhoNox,3,Wed Jul 15 18:14:16 2015 UTC,It's adorable how they think it's The Reddit Problem as opposed to the Silicon Valley Problem.
PaoYongYang,3dcm0w,DylannStormRoof,28,Wed Jul 15 05:37:32 2015 UTC,"People here pretending that Ellen was somehow better sound just sad.  Did you forget that ""reddit isn't completely a free speech platform"" is something Ellen Pao said as well? The false lawsuits and banning the news on her husband's Ponzi scheme? The subreddit banning? The shadowbans? How she was the CEO of a site she didn't even know how to use?  Don't fool yourself into thinking that any of them are any different. Some say that suggesting that Ellen was a scapegoat is too evil-mastermind-ish for reddit, but it's nothing complex like that. The board of directors probably weren't complete idiots and knew how to handle PR. So they either gave her the role after Yishan brought her or he suggested the idea to her in the first place.  It's really simple. But fuck this ""Ellen > Huffman"" bullshit. She was just here for a part-time job to cover her husband's legal fees with that ""golden parachute"". She didn't care about reddit, and knew what she was doing. And so was the board of directors."
PaoYongYang,3dcm0w,Dwarf_Vader,4,Wed Jul 15 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"We don't know Ellen was banning content regarding her husband's lawsuit or even matters more personal to her. That call could also have come from the board, them grasping to keep their CEO cast in a good light."

Apart from that - yes the idea that Pao was somehow fighting against the board's plans to get reddit ready for sale is amusing, but silly."

PaoYongYang,3dcm0w,curiousstudent1233,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know - I read that at the time. I think Yishan is rather pissed that his friend lost her job, which is understandable on a personal level. However if she had really wanted to do these things she would have simply announced that instead of making public statements to the contrary.  And the ""harassment"" claims against fph don't become true simply by repeating them often. I used to lurk there on occasion, and there was a constant stream of ""no harassment, no brigading, stick to reddit's rules""  messages from their mods. They got banned because they got a lot of attention."

PaoYongYang,3cudh8,yaschobob,-8,Sat Jul 11 10:08:18 2015 UTC,The petition had nothing to do with her resignation.

You had 0.00 to do with it.

PaoYongYang,3culks,Cmrade_Dorian,7,Sat Jul 11 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree, it is worth pointing that subs were also banned on Yishan's watch. So the issue of censorship, while badly exacerbated by Pao, predates her. Meanwhile, several background policy issues that aren't apparent to daily users sprung up during her tenure, like only hiring based on political ideology and banning salary negotiations. Fundamentally, those policies need be rolled back too. In truth, I imagine the rules she set forth regarding hiring and employment will be discarded almost immediately, but I'm not holding my breath about seeing the Paoist Five unbanned."
PaoYongYang,3culks,PolygonIsGone,3,Fri Jul 10 23:49:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel that. Yishan was involved with this and it won't be different until they all change their ways or leave
PaoYongYang,3culks,win32ce,3,Sat Jul 11 00:00:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. From the thread:   Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.   I did not accept Chairman Pao & I will not accept Premier Steve if he keeps up her policies.

I mean, I see how it can be a useful way to remind users that they aren't the complete center of attention in these scenarios, but to reduce them to ""the product"" diminishes their role too much. The users aren't the product, their time and attention is; and as the primary owners of that time and attention, they become active participants in a 3-way exchange with interests that need to be taken into account. If bananas could get up off the shelves and walk to another store, petitions they sign would have some real merit."

(Even more broadly, really--as long as it seems Reddit's business management doesn't respect the users.)  I'm not fundamentally opposed to monetization. Something needs to pay for keeping the servers up. But I believe the current management isn't smart or interested enough to do that well. So I'll do my small part to discourage them."

But I don't approve, so I'll work against it rather than helping it come about. And, hey, I'm mostly a lurker. There's always another site out there if the worst comes to pass.

PaoYongYang,3cowq5,Lick_a_Butt,0,Fri Jul 10 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"Youre right and its not the only thing that users should do. Reaching out to those sponsors directly - Telling them that the turmoil occuring within Reddit as a company means that boycotting advertisers is the only way to be heard. Tell the advertisers that their product is great, that you are or would gladly be a customer but that the advertising company needs to cease their activites with Reddit in order to win your business. Even go as far as offering to provide proof of purchase upon said termination of advertisement.    Thats how you make change."
PaoYongYang,3cowq5,muteterror,26,Fri Jul 10 02:01:39 2015 UTC,"You know, considering how reddit works, it really makes no sense at all that she hasn't done an AMA. Hell, How has she not done a dozen of them?  The article is spot on when it calls her out of touch. This is reddit; you gotta at least try to do an AMA, even if you avoid tough questions.  A few paragraphs in a post don't cut it. What is it exactly that you do all day that makes you so busy that you can't take care of the fundamental asset that brings your company revenue: the userbase who both bring and consume content? Seriously."

Yeah, would you bother doing an AMA if a good 90% of the posts in it are vitriolic, people slagging you off, slagging your other half off, insulting or threatening you, demanding you step down effective immediate and people just immediately down voting any replies straight away etc?  Not to mention right now she could post an annoucment saying that every single redditor is going to be given a kitten/puppy/otherassortedcuteanimal and it would get buried in downvotes."
PaoYongYang,3cowq5,TheRighteousTyrant,0,Fri Jul 10 00:09:54 2015 UTC,"If I were the CEO of reddit, then yes, I would do an AMA even if there were a lot of vitriol. Of course I would. The point of the AMA would not be a display of popularity. It would be for damage control; it could help a lot to assuage the concerns of those who don't already believe Pao is Hitler. Those that do won't change their minds, which wouldn't make things any worse for her. She either is out of touch or is aware of how she is perceived and for some reason prefers obscurity, both of which suck for reddit."
PaoYongYang,3cowq5,Mushroomer,0,Thu Jul 9 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"Anyone who wasn't swayed by the ""we apologize"" post probably isn't going to be swayed by the same content presented in an AMA format. And let's be real, that's what it would end up as."

How could she possibly have been the best candidate for CEO? Given the bad moves and publicity on her part, why are they not revisiting some of her changes made during her time as CEO, or for that matter, why is she still an ""advisor""? Even if only considering her proximity to Fletcher's legal issues, a massive red flag should have been raised. The Kleiner Perkins case only added to that. She hasn't seemed like the powerhouse that many make her out to be for a while, and the notion that there is a much larger force driving these issues greatly troubles me.

PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,Junoh315,6,Wed Jul 8 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is just a case of OP not knowing something about Reddit.  Must be Pao in disguise. :^)"
PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,zedingo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:22 2015 UTC,I've been noticing the same thing. Ever since the blackout when the admins were all going deeply negative. I've said some messed up shit that would probably be -20 by now if not for these changes.    Glorious leader intends to steal all the sadistic troll boners! No more FEED ME YOUR DOWNVOTES FOR I HUNGER!
PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,Dinosauringg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:21:31 2015 UTC,You can't downvote any post below zero.
PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,042376x,10,Thu Jul 9 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"If people want to be taken seriously in this debate its best to avoid derogatory language such as calling her a ""bitch"" or ""cunt"" etc. All it does is hurt the cause. Using such language allows the argument to be marginalized and dismissed as ""juvenile antics"" of a vocal minority. However using well argued, educated language with supported facts then perhaps advertisers and more mainstream users who are on the fence about Ellen Pao's leadership will come on board and support the ousting of her as CEO."
PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,triarii7,6,Thu Jul 9 02:55:42 2015 UTC,How can you tell she gave gold to herself? there are  morons who believe in her who could have given her gold in a down voted thread.

PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,Rivarr,2,Thu Jul 9 03:20:42 2015 UTC,What makes you think she gave gold to herself.. and I don't think it's even possible for a thread to have negative downvotes? Blinded by hate.
PaoYongYang,3ckgr4,joesophson,2,Thu Jul 9 01:06:35 2015 UTC,I don't think it's even possible for a thread to have negative downvotes?   You've never upvoted a thread with zero points and it didn't change to a 1?  Such as a thread promoting personal responsibility instead of government coddling (with reliable references) in /r/politics?

Well obviously it's your fault for speaking against our glorious leader and her safe place. I mean the ""safespace"" thing while horribly broken does not get better when they start shadow banning people. There is nothing wrong with safe place, You are attacking capitalist man-pig and should not have differing opinions! Hopefully she gets fired soon.

PaoYongYang,3cioaa,Dwarf_Vader,38,Wed Jul 8 07:10:38 2015 UTC,It's also full of shit.   /u/kn0thing is the executive chairman of reddit. He's above being called to the CEOs office to fire an employee. Not to mention wiki says he lives in NYC.
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,Dog-Person,22,Wed Jul 8 13:24:24 2015 UTC,Yeah and the dialogue between the engineer and Pao is like it's out of some bad fan fiction.

PaoYongYang,3cioaa,quassy,6,Wed Jul 8 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the post said she called him into her office in order to fire her.  Also the post said Victoria came to all the office parties, and I doubt she would have flown there just for that."
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,Dog-Person,14,Wed Jul 8 20:28:58 2015 UTC,Did no one learn from the fallout 4 leaks?
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,Misogynist-bydefault,13,Wed Jul 8 16:06:16 2015 UTC,Without any proof this is worthless   Well if he speaks the truth we'll see a massive ad campaign soon for reddit and facebook integration at some point. But he said the ad campaign was just approved. This means that we're talking a few weeks at tops before we see it. Sometimes only days.
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,RamblinRambo3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"True. But I did say that if the ""prophecy"" begins to be fulfilled, it would be sensible to revisit the post. For now, not many reasons to."

Besides the fact that it was on 4chan, it honestly portrays Ellen Pao as more knowledgeable than she actually is.

PaoYongYang,3cioaa,throwaway72937294,9,Wed Jul 8 07:10:15 2015 UTC,"She actually explained that mistake, Admins actually can link posts from their inbox, she was in the wrong subreddit, which is a much more minor mistake."
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,42Elite,7,Wed Jul 8 16:04:37 2015 UTC,The Facebook thing is untrue at least. I had a thread over in the beta sub about how their current Facebook share integration is really subpar and an admin replied saying that's how they want it.

PaoYongYang,3cioaa,IActuallyLoveFatties,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:55 2015 UTC,Best way to make up something is to make up a lot of it. That way there's a greater chance some of it will be true and then people will believe the rest of it.
PaoYongYang,3cioaa,HazMat68W,2,Wed Jul 8 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"Valid point. When people lie to you, they tend to give too much information in order to make it sound more plausible. So that makes sense."

PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,95wave,-68,Wed Jul 8 09:53:14 2015 UTC,"Considering that most of the recent decisions you all are protesting (including Victoria being fired) were actually made by the male Chairman of the Board (Alex) and he was the one who actually insulted all of your drama as ""popcorn"" yet I haven't seen anywhere close to the volume of unbridled hate for him, I'd say the sexism point can't be completely dismissed."
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedAnarchist,19,Tue Jul 7 16:40:04 2015 UTC,She's the friggin CEO. Buck stops with her
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,Hamster_S_Thompson,-22,Tue Jul 7 21:12:52 2015 UTC,I mean... The cofounder disagrees with you but I guess you know better about Reddit right?
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedAnarchist,7,Tue Jul 7 21:43:02 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. She is legally responsible for the actions of the comp as the CEO.
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,Hamster_S_Thompson,-13,Wed Jul 8 00:23:08 2015 UTC,So you know more about Reddit than the co-founder of Reddit and it's current Chairman of the Board who Ellen Pao reports to.  Got it.
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedAnarchist,2,Wed Jul 8 01:40:49 2015 UTC,Reading comprehension
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,Hamster_S_Thompson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:03:39 2015 UTC,She is legally responsible for the actions of the comp as the CEO.   Please of please tell me where you got your law degree.

However, she has a history people know and dislike, whereas this is the first time I've heard of that dude. So comparing their respective backlashes is a moot point. And crediting it to gender is ridiculous."
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedAnarchist,-14,Tue Jul 7 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"However, she has a history people know and dislike, whereas this is the first time I've heard of that dude   This is the problem with this whole protest. No one actually spent the few seconds of research it would take to learn what they're protesting against, and everyone is just doing knee-jerk reactionary non-sense.  Again, the Chairman of the Board and co-founder objectively deserves much, much more attention and blame. Even he agrees. But no one hear wants to hear that because it goes against the narrative of Ellen Pao being the worst person ever.  It's worse than slacktavism."

PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,biasmyass,3,Tue Jul 7 20:33:44 2015 UTC,No. You're just uneducated and lack any context to Pao's very publicized legal dealings.
PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedAnarchist,-5,Tue Jul 7 20:37:34 2015 UTC,I guess I missed the part where she raped people or whatever.

Probably less given that the petition def has a couple duplicates.  Like come one, these are the same people who are dedicated to making subreddits about posting her face next to swastikas. I'm sure they have the free time to sign the petition a couple extra times.  Also don't give me that ""it's the users who generate the content"" talking point everyone loves to regurgitate without thinking.  Reddit is a content aggregator with links to everything from around the web. The karmawhores who post, repost, and cross post the overwhelming majority of our submissions aren't stopping anytime soon.   We do have some genuine original content, but the people who make that aren't going to stop because of this. Reddit is too easy to use and offerers amazing reach at no cost.  I've also haven't really run into anyone who's so gunho about this Ellen Pao thing that actually generates real content.  Like the mod of /r/crappydesign (who made one the biggest stinks about all this) had 1 submission to his own subreddit in all of 2015.  The user of the parent comment here has been on Reddit for 2 years and has some amazing content for sure and it would be tough to live without it, but I think Reddit will manage.

That, in of itself doesn't bother me, because a lot about Reddit deserves to be criticized, but it was like a group of sad people had gotten together to collectively try to convince one another that they were totally over their ex...by talking about them non-stop.   It was like, ""C'mon, guys, you've got the potential here to dethrone the king of aggregate websites, but all you want to do is talk about how much the king sucks instead of taking the throne for yourself!""  Voat has a lot of potential, but until the servers can truly handle the load of new users, and said users can get over Reddit, it's no different than any other meta subreddit that only discusses the goings-on of Reddit."

PaoYongYang,3ceyuv,RedditorJemi,0,Tue Jul 7 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's as big as an issue that you're trying to paint it to be. The issue of monetization is a problem facing the majority of popular websites nowadays. Those are just growing pains. What I really don't understand is the hate you all have for her and the reasoning you think she should step down. The only two arguments I've seen is a high profile court trial about her last employer (that may have been valid) and the firing of some random employee (that probably was valid). Neither of these things shows that she is bad at her current job. I'm also willing to bet that the majority of these 200,000 don't work at reddit and have no idea what they're talking about or what she does on a day to day basis. The bottom line is calling her a cunt or a nazi or signing a petition isn't really gonna prove anything about her as an employee/boss. Your argument is weak at best and the majority of redditors don't care."

Unless you want the government to step in, this is a petty and frankly immature act.   Reminds of when my roommate decided to drop out of school because it was too expensive to be worth what he'd get out of it after he dropped the pre-Med idea and instead wanted to open a brewery and be a personal trainer.   A kid on our floor got really drunk one night, and he was normally a very quiet kid. He wrote up a little petition with blank lines for signatures on his computer and printed it out and had people sign it.   It said something like we hereby petition to keep ________ here at _________ university. He is a charismatic and energetic young fellow who has a bright future ahead of him and blah blah blah........he is leaving because the high price of tuition here is too much blah blah blah.. Give him more financial aid/scholarship blah blah blah. Dumb drunken rant.   He got 60 signatures by drunkenly taking the paper and a pen and saying yoo we're gonna miss _____ so much sign this petition to keep him here dude it's totally gonna work!

Slashdot never died, because netcraft never confirmed that. But digg did. Spectacularly.  Digg had everything going for it. It was making or breaking businesses at one time. They valued their users, even had a top users section. Then it all began to change. They removed the top user section. Reddit still had very little traction then. Then came out Digg v4. It allowed news sources to auto-submit their articles, actual users were no longer important. Users requested Digg to go back to old Digg, and protested by promoting Reddit. Digg didn't, and thus began the downfall of the reddit of yore. And here we are, again.  Now, get off my lawn!"

PaoYongYang,3byu5f,LivelyRoyale,43,Fri Jul 3 16:47:41 2015 UTC,I'm just waiting for Voat to handle the massive influx of traffic so their site wont crash then I'm outy.
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,twominitsturkish,35,Fri Jul 3 13:07:40 2015 UTC,Didn't Pao like have them removed their servers by telling the (European) hosting firm they were hosting offensive content?  That's like some Gavin Belson level shit right there.
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,-InigoMontoya,4,Fri Jul 3 13:11:56 2015 UTC,I really can't help but think about all of this as a special episode of Silicon Valley.

She is a scientist. She published her research papers on that blog (preformatted papers to which she owns the copyright). That server contained no other data whatsoever.”  Gee, I wonder who told the server hosts about the ""offensive"" content."
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,Wombat_cannon,15,Fri Jul 3 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"I registered with Voat a while ago, just needed something like this to make me properly jump ship. Think I'll delete my account here too in a couple of days."

PaoYongYang,3byu5f,jopesy,2,Fri Jul 3 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"It's funny because reddit would have a lot of crashes even back in 2010.  That's after at least 4 years of development.  Voat started out as whoaverse, so it's been around for probably about a year. It probably has a long time until it's going to be able to handle the users."
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,Wombat_cannon,9,Fri Jul 3 13:27:20 2015 UTC,Is voat and good?
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,GoodGuyGlocker,20,Fri Jul 3 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I only recently heard about it, but from my understanding, it's gearing up to be a replacement for Reddit upon Reddit's impending death. There is currently a massive number of Redditors flooding to Voat to make accounts, now that Reddit is about to die, and the site is down. It can't cope with this many people at the moment, but once they get the site up and running again, hopefully it will be good."
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,gordie44,12,Fri Jul 3 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"As soon as voat is back up, I will make an account. I would urge other redditors looking to jump ship to be patient as voat tries to accommodate the flood of traffic. Also, consider contributing funds to voat, however thats done, so that they can build out the infrastructure for all the new users."

PaoYongYang,3byu5f,DiglettMcDickNuggets,9,Fri Jul 3 12:25:54 2015 UTC,The idea that corporations should screw over their clients is a capitalist idea.

PaoYongYang,3byu5f,SuperC142,5,Fri Jul 3 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, that's how most companies make money. They provide those benefits at a cost that is lower than the user utility and take the difference as a profit."
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,rdrptr,5,Fri Jul 3 11:55:29 2015 UTC,That's not communist.  That's capitalist; make things that people want to buy.
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,garrfunkel,7,Fri Jul 3 12:49:24 2015 UTC,You aren't a client. The advertisers are the clients. You're the product.
PaoYongYang,3byu5f,rdrptr,4,Fri Jul 3 13:05:20 2015 UTC,Which makes us almost more important than the clients. You can modify your product to get more/new clients but you can't really do fucking anything without a product.

PaoYongYang,3byu5f,drylube,5,Fri Jul 3 13:27:34 2015 UTC,"Nope it doesn't do that.    Looks like I still need to dispel that other myth: I've seen in many places lately the following assertion[3]:  ublock blocks ads just like adblock plus, but triggers the ads API to think it got viewed  Completely false. uBlock Origin (or uBlock) does not ""trigger"" any ""ads API"" (whatever that is).

But here is what we know: Victoria was terminated from her position (as liaison between reddit community and celebs for AMAs/Director of Talent at Reddit, Inc.), and it happened without prior warning to the mods of IAMA who depend on Victoria to do a whole plethora of things that help that community and their operations run smoothly.  This, in addition to a long history of reddit admins communicating poorly with mods, has caused mods and a considerable portion of redditors to protest in the form of blackouts (achieved by setting their subreddits to private).  The cause or reasoning for Victoria's termination is the topic of much speculation and debate, but no one knows for sure and likely won't for a while, or possibly ever, because of the NDA's and employer/employee privacy laws in place.  The speculation varies greatly and I won't touch on it here because at this point it is mostly conjecture. But it's out there for you to find."

PaoYongYang,3c0yge,tcpdrangon8,8,Sat Jul 4 04:37:36 2015 UTC,If someone can get in touch with this guy and explain his rights ... he has a really clear-cut case against reddit.  http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/drs/  There's free hotlines available to ensure the justice department can take action ... though he needs to begin the process as quickly as possible as there are strict limits on how long you have to begin the process.  I'm not sure you could have a clearer cut ADA case ... and the irony of Pao practicing discrimination in the work place ... after having just experienced it herself ... she's starting to sound like a seriously classy individual.
PaoYongYang,3c0yge,orangesunshine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:52:44 2015 UTC,"That might be a good scare tactic before Obamacare though the dynamics have changed completely as of late.  ... and though it might have scared an ex-employee with a serious medical condition ... it's not something that would scare the DOJ or a decent lawyer ... and would likely only worsen the employers' deniability when it comes to trying to spin things away from the obvious discriminatory acts.  It's pretty hard to suggest you were unaware an employee was disabled if you provide a custom severance package for them consisting of insurance in leu of money.  The leverage with insurance in these cases though has historically not been the cost, but the possibility of a lapse.  Before Obamacare, a lapse in insurance between jobs meant that any pre-existing conditions would no longer be covered.  ... now that Obamacare has been implemented cases like this one are not only protected from lapses and malicious clauses ... but also if his insurance were to lapse he'd easily be able to acquire a subsidized plan."

PaoYongYang,3bymrl,Slasher_D,3,Fri Jul 3 16:24:20 2015 UTC,Reddit as a whole doesn't really like Jesse Jackson so you make an AMA of someone they don't already like and it most likely won't get many positive and constructive questions. Add on top of that Jesse Jackson would have long winded answeres and tend to not awnsere the original question then you have a pissed off userbase (in relation to the AMA)  There was speculation that because it went bad they tried to shift blame on her   Kinda far fetched
PaoYongYang,3bymrl,Trollioo,5,Fri Jul 3 18:58:50 2015 UTC,Can we talk for a minute about exactly how terrible video AMAs would have been? It would feel like an episode of fucking Oprah where the crowd asks George Clooney questions about how he maintains such a slim figure.

""She was often late so we had some discussion about her lateness,"" Pao said from the stand.  Hermle then pulled up an email from Yip sent in January of 2009 when she explained that she'd been late because her landlord, whose English was limited, had been in a car accident outside of the house and she had helped to translate.  Pao's emailed response was that while it was great that Yip wanted to be late to help with her landlord, ""it would be better for me if you could come to work on time.""  Hermle also cited tensions between Pao and another assistant at the firm, as well as with Trae Vassallo, another junior investor at Kleiner.  In an email read aloud in court, Pao called Vassallo ""competitive and defensive"" and unable to take feedback and listen.  Eventually John Doerr, a managing partner at the firm, asked Pao to mend her relationship with Vassallo, perhaps by spending time outside of the office so they could build a better working relationship."

So many there act as if they are generals or healthcare officials or prominent political figures. There are so many pretentious people who act as if they have the perfect idea of how to run the world.   Yeah I agree with a lot of their ideas but their ideas of implementing them and some of their radical beliefs are just too far. I've seen a lot of downright racist posts and such on there, coming from all races. I've seen a lot of sexist shit too, directed against both men and women. I don't think it should be banned but it's just not the community for me."

Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 cm × 716 cm (16' 1""  × 23' 6"" ),  it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on July 2, 1816. On July 5, 1816 at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain perceived to be acting under the authority of the recently restored French monarchy. In reality, King Louis XVIII had no say in the captain's appointment, since monarchs were not directly involved in appointments made to vessels like a naval frigate. The appointment of the vicomte de Chaumareys as captain of the Méduse would have been a routine naval appointment, made within the Ministry of the Navy.

Well, this was the top comment:   Mr. Jackson,  You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter that has figured out how to manipulate the political system for your own gain. You've personally set back race relations year after year and continue to do more harm than good. Extorting money from companies to line your pockets and threatening to bus in protestors and create a fake racial controversy if they don’t agree to pay you off is NOT civil rights activism. My question is simple; how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife? Bonus question: How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme? Do you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive?   Horrible decision, why would anyone want to ask him anything else? Nearly all other comments that weren't criticizing him seemed like plants and decoys. ""What's your opinion on peanut butter and jelly?"" was a real fucking question to that political manipulator.   The defaults are fucked. /r/iama  Look! ""We will be using this time to restructure our process for AMAs"" HAHAHAHAHA!"

I don't think it's sincere, especially since kn0thing's previous comments about this situation have been so rude. It seems they don't really care about getting things changed (vague responses to the complaints about mod tools for instance) and care more about just getting the site back. Even the mentioning of Victoria's termination was extremely brief (doesn't even address her by name, just calls it a fucking ""transition"").
