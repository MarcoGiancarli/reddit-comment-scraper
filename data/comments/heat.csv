heat,3e3fg5,xcosmicwaffle69,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:45 2015 UTC,FWIW Winslow has a 8'9 standing reach which is the same as  Draymond Green.  It's conceivable that he could play the 4 for stretches.

heat,3e3fg5,xcosmicwaffle69,2,Tue Jul 21 21:41:30 2015 UTC,yeah obviously we'd like to keep him at the 2 or 3 but if he has to play for limited minutes in the 1 or 4 he would be decent at it. It'll be interesting

He's also still growing, probably ~an inch left to grow. He'd do fine at the 4, just not full-time.   But yeah, I'd wait until he's actually adjusted to the game."

heat,3e3fg5,Mellothewise,5,Tue Jul 21 22:10:41 2015 UTC,McRoberts should join Winslow as being a 1 through 4 as I've seen him bring up the ball and run the offense a few times with us

heat,3e3fg5,Mellothewise,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:01 2015 UTC,I'd also like to see the Heat play big with McBob playing some point/forward. He's a great ball handler. Any risk getting beat by smaller/quicker forwards would be mitigated by Whiteside protecting rim.

He's also a pretty good three point shooter, and can even pull up for the midrange J (as seen in his 23pt SL performance).   If we manage to get rid of Chalmers and Bird ( :'(  ) he'll definitely make the roster, but I can't see him more than 10-15 minutes a game with this pretty stacked roster, unfortunately.  I'd even completely cut Ennis (if we could) and sign Richardson as a replacement on the roster."

heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,7,Tue Jul 21 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Except Shabazz Napier is looking improved out there, and he's more proven than J. Rich."
heat,3e3plp,nhojgnos,6,Tue Jul 21 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"i think you are both missing major points in this apples to oranges debate.   1) napier has a guaranteed contract and cap relief won't help unless he is absorbed directly, which is unlikely because his value is low.   2)Napier vs Chalmer isn't a good argument. Chalmers' historical shooting numbers are inflated with Lebron. Chalmers is classed as a combo guard but he is far better defensively right now.  Napier is a true PG, which has the longest learning curve in the NBA. His handles are off the chart along with his vision, but currently takes too many high risk plays. Napier would be ideal to groom behind dragic (as he was behind nash), but with Wade/Dragic ball dominant and neither spot up shooters, it's hard to find mins for him to ball handle.  Napier is a mess defensively still and his jump shot/shooting isn't up to par yet to draw defenders as they will still sag off him.   Richardson is more comparable to chalmers as defensive first minded players. Richardson is a better on the ball defender than chalmers, but also has enough size to cover/switch to wings. He showed great ability to run PNR during SL, but his defense is his calling.  IMO - richardson is a better complement to wade/dragic as a longer defender with 3pt range. Napier has a much higher ceiling in superstar potential, but it could take years to develop even outside of his rookie contract. Being in win-mode now makes Richardson a better choice, but Napier on a guaranteed rookie contract with no market value is hard to sell without assets (picks) to pair them with."
heat,3e3plp,tomgreen99200,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:24 2015 UTC,Good review
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt really say he is more proven that J Rich. He had limited minutes in NBA. When we go and trade Shawne Williams, Norris Cole, Justin Hamilton, and 2 first round picks for primarily Goran Dragic, who is a point guard also, then even the Heat must not have that much faith him Napier. Yes he is a rookie, but why would you devote all those resources for Goran if they saw this ""hyped"" potential in Napier. I dont think Napier is better than Chalmers or Tyler Johnson either and I know I'll get downvoted for it. But when we trade/dump Napier and get someone else possibly, no one will be going ""NOOOO NAPIERRR"" they'll be having an upvote party for the new guy for sure."
heat,3e3plp,Mellothewise,4,Tue Jul 21 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"Well, you were right about one thing...you got downvoted.  All kidding aside, he's shown to have potential and skills. And just in possibly being able to match up against bigger guys (because that is obviously a lot harder in the NBA than in the D-League), he clearly knows how (and is able to) set up teammates for open baskets and other possible shots. We also don't have to have a great second unit PG...just a good enough one. He's also way cheaper than Chalmers and will cost us even less in terms of the tax penalty."
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"That is true about the money thing.. but we could also have Tyler Johnson or Josh Richardson in replace of Napier. Napier can dribble and pass well but past that there is not much I am thrilled about. Small/weak frame, cannot drive well, not that fast, never have ever seen him dunk (not that that matters but still)"
heat,3e3plp,Mellothewise,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"hmm I can understand where you're coming from.  Rio wasn't that much better though at it, didn't seem to rack up a remarkable amount of assists (he even had one too many TOs) and his stats last year showed that he really can't be a go to option when it comes to shooting.   I am also sure Napier could bulk up if need be but if you check basketball reference or ESPN, both Rio and Napier are the same height and Rio is only 10 lbs heavier (obviuosly muscle)...really not much of a difference"
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,2,Tue Jul 21 19:54:18 2015 UTC,napier dunk attempt  Chalmers just looks overall bigger here  and here
heat,3e3plp,Mellothewise,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"Camera angles can make a difference in how people look side-by-side but like I said before, it wouldn't be too hard for him to bulk up even a little.   Looking at the two, Napier doesn't have as much bicep muscles as Rio and it looks like Rio may have a couple inches in terms of a chest build...really not that big of a difference or a factor, I think.  Besides, PGs don't usually need to be known for dunking. So it's not bad if he can't dunk...what would be bad is if he couldn't do a lay-up"
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"You're completely wrong in almost every part of that post.   There's plenty of people who are starting to love Napier after the Summer League. Plus, he's alot younger than Chalmers and gives around the same production. That, to me, equals better.   Not to mention, Napier played almost the entire fourth quarter for almost every single game that he was healthy.   The Miami Heat acquired Dragic because he's All-NBA talent and all they gave up was scraps. Had nothing to do with Napier. If it did, they would have included him in that trade."
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,0,Tue Jul 21 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"If Napier was slated to be the inevitable starter for PG, I dont see why they would go through all that to trade for Dragic if they felt so highly of Napier. The thing is, to move Napier wouldve been a waste of a pick because he wasn't worth anything at the time. So they are hoping that something comes of him.  PER GAME  Napier: 5 pts / 2.5 ast / 2.2 reb - shooting % - 47/36/78  Chalmers: 8.9 pts / 3.8 ast / 2.6reb - shooting % - 46/29/77    PER 36  Napier: 9.3 pts / 4.6 asts / 4 rebs  Chalmers: 11.5 pts / 4.9 asts / 3.2 rebs    Napier PER: 9.3  Chalmers PER: 12.4    Napier TS%: 51.7  Chalmers TS%: 54.9    Napier's PER is gross"
heat,3e3plp,Mellothewise,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:25 2015 UTC,"That's like saying if Miami is so high on Justise Winslow, why would they try to sign Kevin Durant next year?  E: Notice how Napier is around 5 years younger than Chalmers yet put up almost identical stats."
heat,3e3plp,AlexSmythe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Until they actually sign Durant, then its a different story. Winslow was touted to be picked high as 4 in the draft and he fell to 10th. Napier was picked 24th. Napier's stats   PER: Player Efficiency Rating is the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production. The league average is 15.00 every season. VA: Value Added - the estimated number of points a player adds to a team’s season total above what a 'replacement player' (for instance, the 12th man on the roster) would produce. Value Added = ([Minutes * (PER - PRL)] / 67). PRL (Position Replacement Level) = 11.5 for power forwards, 11.0 for point guards, 10.6 for centers, 10.5 for shooting guards and small forwards EWA: Estimated Wins Added - Value Added divided by 30, giving the estimated number of wins a player adds to a team’s season total above what a 'replacement player' would produce."

Didn't realize you wanted to switch topics in terms of players but I definitely agree that TJ is better than Napier (I could be biased because I do like him though haha) and TJ seems to have proven himself more than Napier, I'll give him that."

Beasley and Walker mostly because we gained a lot of depth and they're somewhat liabilities, and possibly Zoran because I've seen mentioned in this subreddit that Zoran wants to get actual NBA minutes, and he probably won't get that on this team. I think his brother would rather see him get minutes than come in for garbage time."

As wishresign said, he's not going to be seeing any meaningful minutes on the Heat. Unfortunately we can't just cut Zoran easily, we hold his contract... We'd need to dump him somewhere; either to a team that would take him, or just a team that has the room to waive him."
heat,3e37hw,Stank3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"depth chart yeeeeeah  1st: Goran, Dwade, Deng, Bosh, Whiteside  2nd: Chalmers, Justise, Green, McRoberts, Amare  3rd: Napier, Richardson, Zoran, Udonis, Birdman  Cut: Ennis, TJ, Walker, Beasley (already cut)  That's my best guess of our current 15.  If anyone gets traded we won't know if its deng, chalmers, or even bosh or wade for that matter or if we'll get anyone back in return.  So anything past those 15 would be speculating even more than it already is.    As for minutes I expect it to be like last year where Spo's rotations for the first 20 games will be incredibly weird and then get quickly pared down.  So if last year is an indication the 3rd string guys will get minutes early in the season and as there are injuries thereafter or when one of the 2nd string guys is not playing well.    Our depth chart is pretty damn solid through the third string and I think that is a major improvement over last year.  If Justise ends up missing games that could open up more time for richardson and zoran to play SG behind wade or SF behind deng.  If wade misses games Green or Justice could be started and that would also give more time to richardson/zoran.

heat,3e3alh,tomgreen99200,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll say what I said in another thread.   When you put the last 3 games together, they combine into 31 minutes. Exactly the amount of minutes he averaged when he got serious minutes. Let's give an actual fair comparison by combining those last 3 games to his first 3.  That's gives you:  13.5 points 3.2 rebounds 2.2 assists and 1 steal on 36% shooting.   To Wade's  13.6 points 6.4 rebounds 4 assists (he also wasn't playing out of position? Don't know where he/she got that from)  Now, Wade's stats might still be head and shoulders better than Winslow, but the way they worded it sounded like it was in another realm."

heat,3e123w,Herrk02,9,Tue Jul 21 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"honestly, you can say the opposite and it'd still be true. Put it this way:   McRoberts is coming from an ACL tear  Chalmers is inconsistent...some nights he will be there and will make an impact and other nights we will wish we had traded him.  Birdman is old, really old.  Stat won't play 70 games, he hasn't played a season without getting injured in a loooong time. When healthy he will help us a lot.  Winslow is very good, but he is a rookie and we never know what we will get from a rookie.  Gerald Green has had the same problem as Mario Chalmers, he is very inconsistent, some games Spo will play him 30minutes, and some nights he won't even play 15 minutes.  Not to mention Napier, Ennis, Richardson, Tyler Johnson and Zoran Dragic. Lets be honest, those won't see play in a lot of game anyway.   I am not saying our bench is bad, it's just unproven. This team needs to play before we can make any predictions. I have no doubt that we will be a force on the East and our bench has improved considerably, but it's still not as good as the Cavs, Hawks or Bulls."
heat,3e123w,celobenicio,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"McRoberts is coming from an ACL tear   Very false.  He's coming off of a meniscus tear which he had surgically repaired.  VERY DIFFERENT.  MUCH LESS SERIOUS.  And the fact that he opted to take the extra time off to have it repaired rather than just scraped or removed means that not only should he back to full form, but that it is much less likely to have any longterm effects that manifest later (like what happened with Wade).   Chalmers is inconsistent...some nights he will be there and will make an impact and other nights we will wish we had traded him.   He'll also be capped minutes wise and counted on less than he has been in his entire career with Miami   Birdman is old, really old.  Stat won't play 70 games, he hasn't played a season without getting injured in a loooong time. When healthy he will help us a lot.   The beauty is that these two combined are our backup center position.  Neither is being counted on to carry a load.  Whiteside should average over 30 mpg, Bosh should play some minutes at center, so Birdman will be called upon to be defensive energy off the bench in short spurts when needed and Amare will be called upon to be an offensive punch in the frontcourt when needed.  Each of these guys will have games where they don't end up playing, not because they're not available, but because we don't call on them.  They're splitting backup duties for one spot (with Amare maybe getting a little time as a 3rd or 4th PF)   Winslow is very good, but he is a rookie and we never know what we will get from a rookie.   Agreed.  Which is why it's great we don't need him to be more than our 4th wing in the rotation.  Perfect situation for him.  And I have a suspicion his game will perfectly mesh into starting off as a low usage hustle defensive guy who plays off ball and can develop over time.   Gerald Green has had the same problem as Mario Chalmers, he is very inconsistent, some games Spo will play him 30minutes, and some nights he won't even play 15 minutes.   Gerald Green is absolutely inconsistent.  But he will play with regularity.  He's a willing shooter, and that has value in itself.  Also, Chalmers scoring ability is not even close to comparable to Green's.  When Green gets hot he can fill it up as well as anyone in the league.  Compare Green and Chalmers per minute scoring production.   Not to mention Napier, Ennis, Richardson, Tyler Johnson and Zoran Dragic. Lets be honest, those won't see play in a lot of game anyway.   Which is the exact point of the OP.  Our depth and quality rotation will make it so that these guys who we needed for parts of last season (TJ, Walker, Ennis) will be lucky to get any floor time or even make the final roster."

heat,3e123w,Jono_LFC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:56 2015 UTC,Of course there is no guarentee how this will play out but on paper you would have to call this heat team stacked.  McBob - He might lose some of his spring but his passing is still going to be the same.  Chalmers - I think he will be traded at some point.  Birdman - High energy but he is old ( Age actually isnt a true reflection as he was out of the league for a while )  Stat - I agree he wont play every game. This is where Haslem \ Bosh \ Whiteside will all need to rotate with the C \ Position  Winslow - Rookie but so far he looks pretty good ( Again no guarentee )  Green - I agree he is a streaky shooter.  Youth - There is no guarentee for any of them either but they just need to bring hustle and some bench scoring.
heat,3e123w,yrogreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:09 2015 UTC,There's no reason McBob should lose his spring or have any ill effect from the meniscus surgery.  It's not a very serious operation (I had a torn meniscus) and has little to no ill effects after
heat,3e0fqz,DR1FTMONKEY,14,Tue Jul 21 00:21:03 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Wade would do that next year. But even if he did, it would be too late (and I think even Wade was aware of it).  He's going to be 34 by next summer and I find it hard to think many teams would want to offer him a contract that ensures a lot of money right then and there (especially with a possibly slow developing trend of vet players like Dirk, Duncan and David West taking less to HELP their teams). If anything, the ball is now in the FOs court as he is now going to be one year closer to retirement. And Sadly...DWade is still going to be that guy who misses time off the court due to leg issues (I really hope it'll be less this year but I am not going to hold my breathe based on his track record).  I also think NOW it would hurt Wade's reputation (way more than the Heat's) if he left next year instead of staying. Mainly because the $20 mill he is going to be paid this coming season will be looked upon as the ""contract that made up for all the money he gave up in the past"" (even though it really won't but I don't think many fans will think about it that far).  Even though this summer we got a full taste of Business man (not basketball player) DWade, I still believe (or want to believe) that Wade will take not as much next year to help this team...  besides why else would he sign a contract that did not ensure a player's option."
heat,3e0fqz,Mellothewise,5,Tue Jul 21 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds as though he simply didn't get any offers from anywhere else so didn't have much choice but to take the Heats offer of 1yr $20m, everybody was under the impression the Heat would have a more than fair offer and that he would never leave anyway so didn't bother chasing.  I think next year if the Heat come to him with a low/veteran offer because of his age and building for the future that he may lean towards another teams low offer instead since the money won't be too different and the relationship between DWade and the Heat doesn't seem to be as good as we thought it was at the moment.   But hey.. I hope he stays, and its probably better to worry about it when it happens, not a week after signing him again."
heat,3e0fqz,Mellothewise,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's too bad they couldn't keep this all behind closed doors because, like you said, now other teams will pick up on the tension between Wade and the FO. I don't think we'll offer him the min. though.   I haven't looked up the numbers like others have but I feel like we can still safely offer him at least $10 mill next year, not rustle his feathers, and still be able to have a great FA period of getting Whiteside to a nice contract and maybe bring on board a nice addition or two.   But age is still a thing, especially I feel when a player who has to run a lot (i.e. Guards) passes age 32 or 33 (not to mention messed up knees quicken that process). I am confident he will be great next year, but I think however great he is this coming season will definitely drop a good amount the following season when he starts approaching 35.  I still think if in some hypothetical (hopefully it stays hypothetical) situation where Wade leaves next year in pursuit of $$$$ it will still hurt his reputation more than it would hurt the Heat's. Not to mention, I think by next season our players who get used to playing the 2 would be easily able to take the up the mantle of starting SG whether Wade stays or doesn't."
heat,3e0fqz,Mellothewise,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope he stays just because he's my favourite athlete, and even if his performance does drop off a lot I still want him with the Heat. I think even as our offer drops next year, he will probably still get the most money with the Heat, so it will just depend how good that relationship is and whether he would prefer to ring chase elsewhere, but I also think we will be a good option for that too."
heat,3e0fqz,_EDM_,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I still value teams as a whole more so than any individual player. But I get you. I agree, I think he would honestly take (for example) $10 million from us than maybe $13 million from another team."

What the hell so the rockets offer Bosh...what was it 80 or 90 for 4 years and he just runs to Riley and tells him ""throw the max at him fam""  That just sounds like a huge knee jerk reaction to me. I get that he has a job to get the best option for their clients but, assuming Bosh was telling the truth about wanting to stay in Miami, couldn't we work that 120 for 5 years for like 100 for 4?"
heat,3e0fqz,tiethy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it's funny because the agent obviously thought ""Get CB as much as possible because the Heat will look after Wade anyway"" but in reality there was not enough money after CB."
heat,3e0fqz,srbufi,5,Tue Jul 21 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"Dan likes to play both sides of the coin sometimes. I fully expect the same drama next year, but if we are faced with the decision of keep Wade or acquire someone like KD, tough decision."
heat,3e0fqz,devstology,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:46 2015 UTC,I think if it come to KD or Wade because Wade is wanting another pay day then we would have to go KD.. but would be very tough.
heat,3e0fqz,_EDM_,5,Tue Jul 21 03:00:10 2015 UTC,No one wants to see Wade go. That's a fact. But if you want to win? You take Durant over Wade 100% of the time. Health is just too important and Durant has age on his side.
heat,3e0fqz,stilloriginal,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"Players come and go but championships are forever. Alonzo retired, Shaq was traded, and Lebron left in free agency. Wade has been here longer and has done more for the Heat than any of them, but he'll retire one day too. The choice between KD and Wade is an obvious one."

It's true what they say, leave while you are on top as he cemented his legacy in Game Six. He can literally trademark ""Game 6"" and make it a million dollar sneaker brand. By returning to the NBA he risks injury, bad slumps, etc that would tarnish this. People don't understand how decorated this man is and how much of a clean image/brand he has.   Staying in Miami and bike riding, spending time with his friends and family, and swimming (good for your knees) is EXACTLY what he needs at his age. He gave the game everything he had and it's time to realize if he doesn't come back it's great for HIM. Yes it's hard to accept as a HEAT or NBA fan but he deserves to go out in glory."

I also think if we ever want to attract any type of official Heat interaction, like an AMA or promotion, attacking another fanbase does not look good on us."

I think doing it in r\NBA is alot worse ( guilty of it a few times ) however it is sports and fan bases will always hate one another.

I'm a Knicks fan, but I subscribed to this sub because I like to keep informed about all things NBA (i.e. keep tabs on the competition). However, what I have gathered of late is that a lot of Heat fans come across as petty, insecure about their team, and/or immature.  Yes, Lebron kinda dicked y'all over when he left, but he did the exact same thing to Cleveland four years earlier. Were you really that surprised? Hasn't anyone ever warned you about shacking up with a girl who cheated on her old boyfriend with you? Same principle applies, I think. Enough whining and name-calling the Cavs. Lebron may be a wishy-washy prick sometimes but that's not the city of Cleveland's fault. And let's not forget that the motherfucker helped the Heat win TWO championships in four years. The Knicks haven't won a championship in like forty years! If Lebron had done that for us, he could fuck my girl, burn my house down, and I'd still be grateful to him.   Y'all have a really solid starting lineup this year; I've always loved watching DWade and Hassan Whiteside has been a fun story, not to mention the solid contributions I expect you'll receive from Dragic and the fiercely loyal and reliable Luol Deng.  And then, of course, there's Bosh, who is one of my favorite players in the NBA simply because he seems like such a cool dude. Now, you guys could take this positive outlook and be the bigger sub, but instead, you just fuel the fire, and it comes across to me very poorly. To be honest, I'm going to be rooting HARD against the Heat this year (I mean, harder than usual) because of the way I've seen people act on this sub. I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this, but I stand by it. I can't take it anymore. I'm out. Peace."

heat,3duxqn,_EDM_,7,Mon Jul 20 00:12:48 2015 UTC,What really separates the players is their ego. Wade didn't find the need to shoot everything he looked to facilitate when needed. Kobe plays 1 on 5 a lot of time. D Wade put his ego aside to give LeBron the face of the team etc. Also on another note how great is Bosh to have the same mentality to do whatever it takes to win I love Bosh. Anyway that's more than we can say for Kobe. Look at Dwight he jumped ship + look what happened now no one and I mean NO ONE is trying to go to LA with Kobe. D Wade > Kobe but that's just my 2 cents.

I guarantee it. Everyone here so passionate about their hatred of the Cavs will be gone; hell, even the people that wanted the Bulls to be our one true rival only a year ago have diminished greatly.  The Cavs are just the in vogue rival. It's cool to hate them because of Lebron, nothing else. Those of us who have watched the Heat for decades know there are only two rivals that last through thick and thin, Orlando and much more importantly- the Knicks.   Only the Knicks can damn near outnumber us in our own stadium when they are contenders. Only the Knicks have gone to war with us, outmatched us, had their coach hanging in the leg of our star player. You can pretend you hate the Cavs but I can bet you any money on earth, when Lebron leaves that hatred will fade away into nothing. The Knicks will still be there, their jerseys in our stands, their old socks and sandals and wrinkled skin in our bars.   Fuck the Cavs. But Lebron doesn't suddenly overwrite our team history. He's just a road bump. The Knicks will always be our rivals because they are among us. Fuck them.  Also I'm really drunk."

heat,3dud7g,tomgreen99200,5,Sun Jul 19 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"Q: I like Josh Richardson, but the Heat usually aren't kind to rookies. If they send him to the D-League does he count against the 15-man roster? Or do we lose our rights to him? The only suggestion I've heard is to ship him overseas. -- Alex, Hialeah.  A: First the clerical matters: If a team wants to retain rights to a player, so that he cannot be plucked off their D-League roster by another team, then they must count him against their 15-player NBA-roster limit. And it's not as easy as just telling a draft pick to go to Europe and keeping his rights. First a rookie tender, basically a non-guaranteed one-year contract, must be offered. If the player bypasses that offer, then he can go overseas with his drafting team maintaining his rights. However, the player also can say, ""Sure, I'll take the tender."" In that case, if he is not retained by his drafting team, he is free to be signed by or sign with any other NBA team. I'm just not sure where all the talk of ""stashing"" Richardson is coming from. He only would cost the Heat the NBA minimum and displayed enough skill in summer league to at least merit consideration for a roster spot in camp. He is one of those players who is probably as polished now as he is going to become. That's not a negative. That's a reality. He's ready.  Q: I've always been intrigued by the tale of the Dragic brothers. There does seem to be a wide chasm in their abilities, and I've felt that the Heat have been carrying Zoran Dragic on their roster so as not to upset Goran Dragic while his future with the Heat was uncertain. Now that Goran has been signed long term, isn't it time for the Heat to evaluate Zoran on his own merit? As they try to craft the best 15 man roster for the season, do you think Zoran has the ability and/or promise to merit a spot? -- Bob, Coral Springs.  A: The one thing I've learned about NBA roster construction is that it rarely is as simple as lining up the 15 best players. The salary cap certainly weighs heavily. But so does chemistry and cohesion. Beyond that, the final two or three players on the roster rarely play anyway, so other factors enter into that portion of the roster. It's all a long-winded way of saying that while Zoran probably is not among the 15 best roster candidates, his presence plays both toward the Heat ""family"" approach, as well as a nod to how significant it is to make Goran feel at home. I've said this all offseason: When calculating the Heat's final 15, start with Zoran and Udonis Haslem as the givens for the back end of the roster, and then go from there. Short answer: It's just the way it is.  Q: I'm sorry I have to be realistic here. People are predicting third or fourth seed for the Heat in the Eastern Conference. I even read some put them in the Eastern Conference finals. Really? Yes it looks good on paper, but they have not played with each other and are injury prone. Right now, the Heat are a sixth seed at best. The Bucks are the team to watch out for. This year to me is a project to see what pieces mesh well together. Then we trade the rest who do not fit our plans. -- Josue, Miami Lakes.  A: But beyond Cleveland, every team in the East goes into the season with chemistry question marks, including the Bucks. And while Milwaukee's youthful core is intriguing, it is the Heat who have proven commodities in their starting lineup such as Chris Bosh, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade and even Luol Deng, let alone Hassan Whiteside. When in doubt, I would go with the known quantities, which is why I think the Heat are getting so much respect when it comes to a possible quick-turn resurrection."
heat,3dud7g,Wildlinger,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about Dragic brothers (2nd Ira question).   Goran said after last season that as special as it was playing with his brother in the NBA, he was also stressing about Zoran not being able to get a chance to play.  I really don't think Goran wants his brother warming the bench in Miami but would rather see him get a chance to play, even if it's somewhere else. Zoran is an NBA ready rotation player. Just not on the stacked veteran Heat team built to compete now.  I'm certain that in the long run Goran and Zoran would be much happier apart if Zoran got a chance to play.  I would caution against thinking that Goran just wants his brother next to him. As I already noted, Goran actually said that having his brother next to him and stressing about not playing, made him stress and worry much more.  If the Heat get a chance to trade Zoran I would take it without any fear of Goran (or Zoran) feeling slighted. I think that the exact opposite might be the case, where Zoran would feel slighted if he didn't get a chance to prove himself on the court. This is his last guaranteed season and if he doesn't get the chance to play he might have to return to Europe. And in the long (and short) run that would undoubtedly cause more stress in the Dragic family, than Zoran getting traded would."
heat,3dud7g,Hey_Im_Joe,2,Sun Jul 19 17:32:14 2015 UTC,"The only reason to stash him that I can think of, is to wait until we have the space to sign him, but if I'm Rich I'm grabbing the first available contract i can. 500+ thousand is a lot of money for a kid to wait on while a team tries to move some pieces around"

heat,3dt4uw,Beep_meep,9,Sun Jul 19 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"---A general manager with another NBA team told me Mario Chalmers and Shabazz Napier are the players the Heat has been most aggressive in shopping, with Miami preferring to move Chalmers because of his $4.3 million salary.  The GM said the Heat would be content getting back only a second-round pick (or less) for Chalmers. Though Chris Andersen could be moved, the GM said the Heat hasn’t offered him to his team, and that Miami hasn’t shown an inclination to move Josh McRoberts.  --- One positive with Napier, who averaged 17 points in Summer League and is due to make $1.3 million this coming season: “He looked quicker this summer,” said Heat assistant Dan Craig, who coached Miami's summer league team. “He's been great in terms of getting into the paint and getting paint touches. We had challenged him [about] getting in the paint more, playing with a higher motor....  ""He looks night and day from last summer. His pace and quickness have improved. [And] he's improved his three-point shot.""  ---The Heat will make rookie guard Josh Richardson an offer to retain his rights but must decide whether to make room for him on the roster or encourage him to play a year overseas. Richardson’s reps want him to be in the NBA and it’s ultimately his choice whether to try to make the team in October.  The NBA “has always been my dream; nobody wants to play anywhere else,” he said, adding he doesn’t know if he would consider a year overseas if asked.  Richardson averaged 11.8 points, shot 8 for 21 on three-pointers with 17 steals and 9 blocks in 10 Summer League games. Does he look ready to be an NBA player now?  “I think he does,” Craig said. “It's just about roster wise what we're going to be looking at in terms of what we really need. When everything is said and done, I think he's going to be right there in the mix.  “He's another guy we're really encouraged by on both sides of the floor. Offensively and defensively, just his overall demeanor.  He approaches the game as if he was an NBA player already. That’s pretty encouraging for a kid coming out of college.”  Problem is, the Heat has 17 players without him. Even if Miami trades Chalmers and cuts Henry Walker, there still would not be room for Richardson unless Miami dumps another player."
heat,3dt4uw,Hey_Im_Joe,4,Sun Jul 19 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think, especially if they want Richardson, it's Napier or TJ that goes.

heat,3dt4uw,CJHEAT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:42:27 2015 UTC,"Other than tax savings, is dropping and trading all those guys just to sign j rich really worth it seeing as he'll end up being an end of bench guy anyway."

I'm actually surprised they want to get rid of Napier. He's just starting to develop into a productive player. If anything they should get rid of Chalmers, Ennis, and Walker then sign Richardson."
heat,3dt4uw,Mellothewise,2,Sun Jul 19 11:50:19 2015 UTC,"So Obviously, in terms of the players the majority of us want to be held onto and KNOW will be held onto... our starting 5 (DWade, CB, Goran, Deng, Whiteside) are all in, then we have McBob (6), Green (7), Stoudemire (8), Winslow (9), Haslem (10), Birdman (11) [since it seems like the Heat don't seem as concerned about trying to trade him as they are Rio. They also seem to feel having Bird is less detrimental than having Rio...probably because we have way more guards than bigs]  Obviously Rio is ""in"" (for now) but he's on too big of a contract that is clearly a detriment to the Heat and they want to trade him (a big open secret)...especially since we have an abundance of potential PGs who can play the point. but for now we'll say he's in (12).  Zoran (even though he may be questionable) is on a not-too-bad contract (13)  That just leaves TJ, Napier, Richardson, Walker, and Ennis.  Walker is out (obviously).   Ennis hasn't shown enough to keep him and since it's been revealed he is currently dealing with knee issues that will probably further decrease the chances of the Heat bringing him back (this is sadly not the time to show pity)  I think TJ and Napier are ahead of Richardson. Not saying Richardson is better than the two but I feel he can offer enough that we would be missing out if he WASN'T on the team.  I hope Rio gets traded so that we can bring him on board. If Napier has to be traded, that would be too bad, but wouldn't be the end of the world. I feel with just the first 10 guys I listed alone in the beginning, we'll have a great rotation that is definitely playoff caliber and hopefully championship caliber."
