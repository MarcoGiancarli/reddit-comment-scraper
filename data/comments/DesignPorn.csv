DesignPorn,3dueht,Darekbarquero,45,Sun Jul 19 16:34:52 2015 UTC,Why? A modern T.V. weighs virtually nothing. I bet a fan isn't that much different in weight.   If that is anchored into a stud there is no reason that design couldn't hold the weight.

DesignPorn,3d682c,Keepon_keepin_on,5,Mon Jul 13 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I will make a full sized version. I can easily imagine one. I put a video showing the functionality of the device in the top comment.   *update 2 -Never mind.. Someone bumped back to the top. Thanks!! :)  *update 1 - the comment with the video now lives below your comment that you feel like its over engeneered. I suppose I can comment to that.  *takes a deep breath..   Lets say Shoe laces are over engeneered relative to velcro straps. Here is a difference. Shoelaces seemingly have a special invitation that does not dawn on one emediatly. Velcro may also have invitations but I can easily see that possibilities are less so lets focus on laces. One can tie their laces in any number of ways. It may seem silly but There is oportunity for a wonderful finding or a happy accident to take place there. Also, Most children Learn to tie their shoelaces at an early age and develop the tacit knowledge to do so completely mindlessly for the rest of their lives. The skill to lace and tie a knot opens new neuropathways in a child's brain that quickly become habitual and also become the highway for new types of thinking. I don't believe that the teaching/learning moment for using velcro carries near the impact of the moment one learns to tie laces. I believe that there is a strong connection between the hands, brain and heart. I have heard that Some neuroscienctific findings actually suggest that people identify with the image of their own hands more so than the image of their own face. I realize that we live in a world that largely believes that things should be as simple as possible while efficiently serving a purpose in a direct and exclusive manner. That is boring to me and I don't live in that world permanently. I believe that products can be anything. I also think that things can encourage or even require practice and skill because that's good for people and their hands, brain and heart. A generation of children standing in velcro strapped shoes probably equates to a generation that largely can't tie a knot. Im not saying the Velcro kids would be dumb nor am I saying we should be stuck in the tradition of shoe laces for the love of knots. We should always be moving along boiling things down and smashing things together. However, in a world of Apples and Oranges, we may be tempted to judge oranges for how much they are like apples. I say Oranges can be great oranges if one can consider the differences and shift perspectives to notice rewards. I hope this makes sense. :)  Speaking of laces, I should mention that I actually designed this product to be DIY. I'm selling preconstructed cases while I DIY designing the best way to DIY for others."

Its missing a lot of simplicity that would confuse me if I were to use one. Especially since the hinges are laced and can fold either way. Unless someone explained it to me and I had a bit of practice, I feel like I'd spend a good ten or fifteen minutes trying to fold it into the correct orientation.  But this is just at first glance. I haven't had a chance to play with it in my hands, so maybe it's easier than it looks."

I did buy a lifeproof case, but that is also waterproof and made my phone much more resilient."
DesignPorn,3d682c,Cerulean_Shades,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts about this. I think I see your perspective and agree. I'm selling the bamboo easels for $75 and not so well so far. I wish there was a way to comfortably sell the FlipSteady easel cheaper but it just doesn't make sense for me. The cases are hand made by Americans and take hours to make.  I suppose it's the job of a designer to find a working balance. It hasn't been easy but I learn more with every effort. I don't believe I'm there yet but won't let that stop me from sharing my products along my way  :) Thanks again for your perspective.
DesignPorn,3d682c,WrestlesAtWork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:26:05 2015 UTC,"What about a kit?  Is it technically complicated to assemble, requiring special tools or is it pretty basic skill-wise, but time consuming?  I think selling the parts with a well written assembly manual and giving your users the option to spend a few hours on assembly themselves could make them more marketable.  I'd be much more willing to spend $30-40 and a couple of hours for the bamboo easel than $75, or $50-60 for the others. (the smart case for the iPad is $49 anyway I think, and this is much cooler)"
DesignPorn,3d682c,puhdul,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"Your reading my mind! :) I actually developed this product with DIY in mind. Its hard to manufacture something like this in the USA and I want to see if I can have my idea more massively adopted by passing the hand work to the consumer. The idea is awesome, makes sense and is GOOD for people and their sense of value in the product and themselves. One can even argu that the end user will have invested more and reeped more in the spirit of being thrifty or crafty. Now that the product has reached a state that I feel comfortable selling,  I'm releasing preassembled versions in limited quantities on my Web site so I can practice making them over and over while I think about my DIY version and design clear instructional content for assembly. Thanks for the suggestion. I have heard this a few times now and take it as a sign I'm thinking in a reasonable direction. Sanity is nice to know you have!! :)"

It makes it seem to fall into the uncanny valley for binder clips.  Like they went through all that effort to make it look cosmetically like a binder clip,  then said ""fuck it, let's use really expensive textured wool to make sure people know it's a prestige product.""  In the same vein,  there's something shaped wrong with the handle. I think the top should be flatter.  But leaving those criticisms aside,  it's a fucking binder clip. Which has  only the lowest connotations to me. ""My £5,000.00 handbag is based off a 2¢ piece of shit that people use to hold their boring paperwork together. I'm such a man of the people.

Most high-end TVs are aiming to be edgeless, and for good reason. For some reason Bang and Olufsen have decided to put an abnormally large edge on their TV? And the edge itself looks to be bevelled like an old picture frame. Visually it just doesn't work.  I'm not sure what the thing on the right is. If it's a speaker, why only one? It's not even a speaker bar, the sound quality from that would be very poor which is not good from a company that is mostly known for their speakers. Even if it's not a speaker, why is it on a little podium? It's an ugly plain box, not art. Hide it if possible, don't deliberately show it.  The majority of this image is taken up by a polished clean floor, a display stand and a wall. I usually like the minimalist look, but I feel that the whites and greys here are just bland and boring.

They could be using ""sauce BBQ (ketchup, moutarde, mayonnaise)"" to refer to what the BBQ sauce is based on, not that they're condiments.  As I understand it, ""Carolina barbecue"" in the US is sometimes known for its use of mustard-based sauces. See Wikipedia's article on regional barbecue in the US, particularly in the Carolinas. It mentions both mustard-based and ketchup-based sauces being used in Carolina barbecue.  And apparently, mayonnaise-based BBQ sauce is popular in some places too. There's a Southern Living article that talks about mayonnaise-based ""white barbecue sauce"" being particularly popular in north Alabama. The Wikipedia article above mentions it and various other regional BBQ styles in the US."

The door was ajar, light shining through the dust motes floating in the stale air. He entered.  The room was the same as it always was, kaliedoscopic and colorful in it's array of posters. But his friend, omnipresent on his bed, either reading or fiddling with his phone, wasn't there. He called out for him, but there was no reply.  Then it caught his eye. The framed picture of a blank piece of wallpaper his friend had put up, in ironic contrast to the explosion of colours on the wall. But it wasn't blank any longer . A spindly, dark blotch stood in the center. Perhaps it was a tree of some sort; he always did say he was going to get into painting one of these days.  He approached it, squinting his eyes to get a clearer view in the dim light. It took him a few seconds to see it. He recoiled, staggering backwards.  There his friend stood, his face frozen in a silent scream behind the frame."

DesignPorn,3ao7vt,KevlarYarmulke,14,Mon Jun 22 03:25:14 2015 UTC,Truly good design doesn't sacrifice function for looks.  This design clearly sacrifices function for looks.
DesignPorn,3ao7vt,Engineer_Everything,6,Mon Jun 22 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Does it though?   I mean, I know that most people think of only going to the sink to wash their hands... Usually turning on the water at full blast for a few seconds for which you would need a deeper bowl.   But this might be a good design in drought areas. ""Wash your hands, but don't do it in a way that splatters all over the place/uses a lot of water."" I'm no design geek... But I figure design can also help us pick up new habits.  Besides... I can also see this being helpful in a kitchen... Maybe not as what it was designed for/as a sink... But for washing and cutting vegetables?  Edit: Though it does look like a bathroom sink, so you would need to modify the design a bit for the latter."
DesignPorn,3ao7vt,catalyst4evr,2,Tue Jun 23 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"The most efficient way to wash your hands is actually to fill a bit of the sink with water, add soap and wash your hands in it, and then rinse them off briefly after.   This sink would also splash much easier when using it...  This ""sink"" design just doesn't hold water, figuratively and literally, so I just feel it's not a great design apart from aesthetic appeal."
DesignPorn,3ao7vt,Engineer_Everything,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"No one in a drought stricken area would fill a sink of usual size before washing their hands in it... It wastes water (as you could probably lather up, turn on the tap, and rinse using less water than would fill the sink).  That said, the sink that is pictured does splash quite a bit, and with the faucet in that position, you would need to lean in a lot in order to wash your hands."
DesignPorn,3ao7vt,catalyst4evr,3,Tue Jun 23 19:12:07 2015 UTC,You don't fill the whole sink... Just enough to wash your hands lol

NATO allies are supposed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, the US is the only country to consistently hold up that bargain and exceed it.   It was American, not French, not British and frequently not German soldiers that lined the Fulda Gap, waiting to die as a 'tripwire' for NATO should the USSR cast her desires further westward to say nothing of the rows and rows of white crosses just south of a certain beachhead."

Was it in lying that Iraq had WMD, bombing millions of innocent people in the process? Or perhaps its support for Saudi Arabia, a state which in many respects is as cruel and terrible as ISIS, which they happily ignore in the name of economic interests. Stop watching FOX news buddy, there's absolutely nothing ""humanitarian"" about the USA."

Sure there are plenty of little Euro-states that are more humanitarian than the US in spirit, but who is it that sends the massive hospital ships, who is it that docks her carriers to shattered piers to provide water and light after a disaster, who is it that sends fleets of cargo planes larger than most air forces laden with supplies? Not the Europeans (in meaningful numbers), not Russia or China (without strings attached, anyway) but the United States. Further, American citizens volunteer more and donate more than any other nation's.   Also, the most incriminating estimate for civilian casualties in the War on Terror is the in the high 100,000's not millions. Saudi Arabia sucks but nowhere near as much as ISIS and we've got to be in the game in the Middle East and Israel is too far and won't let us have long term bases.

DesignPorn,39ia34,ranma08,14,Fri Jun 12 14:02:21 2015 UTC,"Oh they're still great. The prose is excellent, and the Roman narrative is told like compelling fiction through the first three books. He turns some pretty dry Roman writers into a well-crafted story.   As for the last three books though, they are a little more disjointed. It seems like Gibbon wasn't particularly interested in the Eastern Romans, and so the focused Roman narrative gives way to a broad survey of Europe during the middle ages.   The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is easily one of the most important works of its kind. It basically set the standard for how future historians would write and approach primary source material.   That being said, Gibbon's history hasn't held up perfectly. Most of it is still good history, but centuries of additional work have challenged some parts of his account. He gets justifiably criticized for sacrificing historical accuracy for a general criticism of organized religion, for dismissing the Eastern Romans, and for innacurately characterizing centuries of Roman history as a constant and lurching decline phase.   Still, I think it's worth a read for the fantastic story and its tremendous significance."

DesignPorn,39abmw,sprucenoose,6,Thu Jun 11 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"That appears to be exactly how they work:   the faucets are characterized by hollow, latticed, and segmented constructions through which multiple waterways run before converging at the faucet's aerator. The result: What is meant to look like an illusion, with water gushing from the slender metal armature, is in reality a new way of getting water into the sink   Source"
DesignPorn,39abmw,50missioncap,4,Wed Jun 10 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"I recall an old physics teacher telling us of an experiment where people were asked to grip 2 intertwined pipes - one running warm water, the other cool.

I just wonder if someone is going to do that with this design and get into a beef with American Standard."
DesignPorn,39abmw,BoboBublz,4,Wed Jun 10 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"This is because our sense of temperature works in a weird way. We don't sense a spectrum of temperatures, as one would expect. There is a sense of ""cold"" and a sense of ""warm"". When both are activated, our brain interprets it as ""very hot"".  I don't think that would be possible with these faucet designs though, for two big reasons: 1 being that these designs are probably too big to set off the phenomenon you brought up, and 2 being that these faucets likely fit into your existing plumbing, meaning the water it gets is already (close to) one temperature; it doesn't contain different temperature water in each pipe of the ""lattice"", if you will."

They mean that the ""lines"" in the pattern of the faucet are probably actually small tubes and they carry the water up and all dispense at the top where they meet at the faucet's head.    It would be pretty cool if there was a strong pump at the base of the faucet, and it projected the water at a certain angle upward, making it flow to the head of the faucet without leaking through the netting."

DesignPorn,39abmw,TommiHPunkt,0,Wed Jun 10 14:25:07 2015 UTC,a glass tube would work... but you'd need a water softener below

The metal pattern is hollow on the inside, and that's how the water flows through. Scroll down, you'll see images of the faucet running, plus different designs.   So fucking cool."

I know what they're used for, I've been using them for prototyping for 15 years.   The comparison to 2D printing is not really relevant because of the complexity of a 3D part may range from simple to impossible to machine/mold/lasercut/etc. And 3D printing is almost always more expensive, even at lower quantities, but it's easier and faster."
DesignPorn,39abmw,sandrocket,3,Wed Jun 10 23:06:37 2015 UTC,"I think you read my comment as an reply to your second sentence. But it was meant as a reply to this:   3d printing has never been about price, as it's always been more expensive than the standard manufacturing, for the vast majority of designs anyways.    If something is impossible to produce in any other way, or if something is produced in a quantity where the tools  (e.g. injection molds) are too expensive, 3D printing  is about the price and a lot cheaper. So it's not ""almost always more expensive"".   The comparison to 2D is relevant. If you need 5 copies of, let's say a pop-up card, you won't use an offset and not produce a die cut mold. You'll use a digital printer and a cutting plotter, since it's much cheaper."

DesignPorn,39abmw,thefattestman22,-2,Wed Jun 10 17:42:53 2015 UTC,"Calling it 3D printing is kind of a misnomer and it smacks of buzzword marketing.  Here's a recent discussion on the actual method used (Selective Laser Sintering, or SLS), which was developed in the 80s and came into common use for manufacturing in the early 2000s — long before '3D printing' and the Maker scene came into existence.  These days, the original term 'additive manufacturing' is synonymous with '3D printing', but most of the time when you see the latter it's used as a buzzword or in reference to the Maker scene, neither of which have much to do with heavy industries manufacturing."
DesignPorn,39abmw,CHooTZ,4,Wed Jun 10 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"3D printing is a general umbrella term. It is a PR/marketing and non technical term, yes, but covers SLS, SLA, and most other forms of additive manufacturing.  It's not the formal engineering term but is a widely recognized label."
DesignPorn,39abmw,dangersandwich,4,Wed Jun 10 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering   technique that uses a laser as the power source to sinter powdered material (typically metal), aiming the laser automatically at points in space defined by a 3D model   Sounds like 3d printing to me.  I am not an expert, but I at least know its not 2d printing.  Besides buzzwords are what drive inovation.  Click here, you wont believe what innovations have been created by buzzwords!"
DesignPorn,39abmw,Red-Panda,2,Wed Jun 10 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"I don't understand /u/dangersandwich's gripe with the term either. Plastic extrusion printing and selective laser sintering are essentially one and the same for all aspects other than for the people actually designing the specific technical details for how it's going to operate. Both build a physical manifestation of a 3d model up layer by layer using solid materials. Yes it's true that one sinters metal powder using a laser and one extrudes melted plastic, but I don't think that that's enough of a difference to justify there being separate terms to describe the procedures for the general public - that's just more confusing than it's worth."
DesignPorn,39abmw,Shadow703793,2,Wed Jun 10 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"For the general public and hobby groups, there's nothing wrong with using '3D printing' as a catch-all term because, as you said, it essentially describes the same process.   The problem begins when you have startups and engineering firms trying to make a product, and pushing 3D printing as a replacement for machining, molding, and casting, when any of those three processes would work better and cheaper than an additive method. Read the linked discussion from my first comment.    Case in point, look at how hard they're trying to market these things:   ""The [SLS] process democratizes design and decentralizes manufacturing, which will eventually upend the design and construction industry, along with many others. A new, more efficient business model for bespoke design could be on the horizon. This would reduce the inventory pressures that arise from mass production of personalized products, while opening up a new world for both design and construction,"" explained American Standard.   ...are you shitting me? SLS has absolutely nothing to do with ""democratizing"" and ""decentralizing"" the manufacturing process. Low-end SLS machines are just starting to come out at $5,000, and if you want to do any heavy manufacturing (such as to make these faucets), you need a $250,000 SLS machine. At that point you've defeated the whole point of 3D printing: high speed, low cost prototyping."
DesignPorn,39abmw,IndustrialSabotage,3,Wed Jun 10 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"It essentially uses metal powders, and it is extremely expensive to print and so are the printers, but I'll be damned if it isn't really baller."

I only use it for milk. I could see if you don't wash your dishes that it could be a pain, but it is not made for anything other than milk. I have had other milk pitchers and the reason I prefer it is milk does not splatter when you pour from it. So you can't eat cereal from it, but if you use it as intendend it works."

This seems like the kind of thing that you pour cream into when having friends over for coffee, rather than using it for storing cream (no lid).  An hour after your coffee party, you empty and rinse the thing, then fill it with water.  When washing dishes after everyone goes home, add a bit of dish soap, half full of water, cover the opening and shake.  Rinse, let dry, put away, repeat.  If you let it sit for days, yeah, it will get pretty fucking nasty and be a bitch to clean."

DesignPorn,38e15z,Fuckledore,12,Thu Jun 4 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on their scale, but I'm going to disagree.  Businesses typically aren't in business unless it's profitable.  There is a market niche for stuff like this, and although its not as big as with the juices you may be used to seeing, it has higher profit margins per unit and less competition.    Also, what some may perceive as over the top materials costs (fancy bottles, box, delivery?) are infact marketing costs, which we know is effective because it ended up on reddit, to name one place.  Even if that were not the case, other companies that would save money on packaging would pay for marketing in other ways.  So it's not an 'extra' or superfluous cost.   I'd say these guys are killing it.  Brb, getting inferior juice."
DesignPorn,38e15z,BluntTruthGentleman,7,Wed Jun 3 19:42:25 2015 UTC,"I never implied they weren't profitable, I just don't think these juice companies will be sustainable in the long run.  There's a ton of these ""cold-pressed juice"" boutiques where I live. They're all basically the same as you describe (high marketing costs, low production costs) and sell to a niche market of trendy, health-conscious upper class people.  I'd argue they're not sustainable because there's a continuing saturation of them into these niche markets. I could see a few companies doing really well and dominating the market, becoming comparable to something like Booster Juice or leading Bubble Tea brands, but I don't think most of these juice companies will survive.  I've bought into these juices before. In my friend circle, we went crazy over them for a couple months. But now we seldom buy them and only occasionally buy a bottle from local gourmet groceries that stock them daily when we're buying groceries. A large part of their selling factor is that they're cool, and eventually trends will shift. As more and more articles decry the touted health benefits of juice cleanses and juice nutrition, these companies will make less and less money."
DesignPorn,38e15z,Fuckledore,3,Wed Jun 3 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing about all the fro-yo places popping up a few years ago, but for now at least there's still one on every corner."
DesignPorn,38e15z,sensedata,4,Wed Jun 3 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Not sure what this particular juice is or what the marketing scheme might be, but there are MLM companies that pop up daily to take the place of ones that were dissolved. Not saying that this company is a MLM scheme, but just that marketing only gets you so far if your product doesn't absolutely dominate the competition in some way. $70 juice sure as fuck isn't going to affect Welch's market share.  Usually the MLMs sell energy drinks or some other crappy product with bullshit purported health benefits, and they charge outrageous prices for their product. They exist for a year or two, make the people at the top quite rich, then fizzle out for one reason or another. There are always plenty of idiots trying to get into them and plenty more who are willing to buy the product. It's 100% about marketing (packaging is very important) and 0% about the actual efficacy of the product or legitimacy of the claims.  I briefly worked with a guy who was into so many of these MLM pyramid schemes that his other coworkers called him King Tut. Learned all about them from him - it sad that he kept getting roped into em without ever learning any better but he was delusionally convinced he was gonna get rich from one eventually."
DesignPorn,38e15z,its_the_perfect_name,2,Thu Jun 4 01:35:34 2015 UTC,"It's not a MLM, it's a bar in Chicago.  Well, I've never been there.  Maybe it doesn't really serve drinks, but instead convinces people they can make money if they hassle their friends and relatives to hassle their friends and relatives, and so in.  edit: Nope, not a bar (but it sure looks like one.)  Just a purveyor of fancy-schmancy looking pseudo-health food stuff."
DesignPorn,38e15z,tomdarch,2,Thu Jun 4 03:03:45 2015 UTC,"Hah well my comment makes no sense then, but maybe you're right and they do get customers to hassle their friends into signing up.
