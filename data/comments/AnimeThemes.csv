AnimeThemes,3dts3f,yuitimothy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:41 2015 UTC,"Just a FYI for next time, please include the anime's broadcast year and season in your title. Also adding what ED it is (ED1, ED2, etc) would be nice.  This:  Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata - ""Colorful"" [ED][720][WEBM]   Turns into this:  Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata (Winter 2015) - ED - ""Colorful"" [ED][720][WEBM]   EDIT: Also, this has already been posted. Please check if the OP/ED has been posted by searching the subreddit or looking in the wiki before posting."
