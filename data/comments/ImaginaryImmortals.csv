That was what the old woman said to him, as he placed a few pennies in her outstreched hand.   But there was no lady with the hood, much less a scythe. Just the dark allure of the cold river.   He stepped off the bridge. Night was calling his name.   *  The water was made of shadows. The boat - bones.   ""Where are we going?""  A long time passed until the hooded figure standing in front of him answered.   ""Far away.""   His whisper carried over the vast emptiness around them.   ""You be careful. Many drowned while passing here.""   The waters moved as if in response.     -187"
