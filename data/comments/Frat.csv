Frat,3e4u8h,dddane,3,Tue Jul 21 23:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a serious try here (NOTE: Not sure if your account is a throwaway, but ""Frat boy"" is not really used) A fraternity is an association of men ""brothers"" in a collegiate environment who all hold similar values and goals, usually related to personal, academic, and service pursuits, who form an organization for social interaction. Fraternities hold social events, conduct community service, have both formal and informal mentorship among members, and generally act as a support and social network within college. Prospective memebers of a fraternity usually undergo a ""rush"" process where local chapters hold events to recruit and make themselves known among students. A rush can get a bid, or offer to join a chapter, and accept it decline. If the bid is accepted, they will probably undergo some form a new member education, usually being a pledge. Being a pledge can include a variety of things and varries in time and commitment needed. Many fraternities hold similar values, with different names, and the reason one should join a fraternity at a particular school is because of the members of that chapter, not reputation or how ""frat"" a chapter is. Joining a fraternity in college is a great way to meet friends, surround yourself with people who will better you, and gain other opportunities in both academics and outside. This is what I've got since your question was very vague"
Frat,3e4u8h,magnumz,3,Wed Jul 22 00:23:26 2015 UTC,Well. This pretty much covers all the bases. Threads over boys.

Frat,3e4u8h,dddane,2,Wed Jul 22 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"Some more info:   A Pledge: One who is not yet a full member of the fraternity, and is undergoing a probationary affiliation; may be dropped at any time, for any reason (or lack there of).  Ritual: That'll be explain when the time comes-- it's the cornerstone of every fraternity. The actual rituals are not what you've heard, and are not hazing; almost every fraternity closely guards the secrecy of theirs. The same across national organizations.  Widely used or Confusing nicknames:  Pike-- short for Pi Kappa Alpha  Fiji-- short for Phi Gamma Delta  PiKapp-- short for Pi Kappa Phi  Teke (Pronounced like Teak)-- short for Tau Kappa Epsilon  Deke (Pronounced like Deek) -- short for Delta Kappa Epsilon  Underground frats are ones not recognized by the school/their national organizations."

Frat,3e01ul,28wiseman,30,Mon Jul 20 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"Former house manager here. First and foremost, you're going to hate your life for a while, but hopefully the free rent or whatever subsidy you get will be worth it like it was for me.   Some tips I can give you:   Delegate EVERYTHING but above all else delegate the chores between live ins and pledges. Pledges are way better at cleaning than actives, because they're afraid of screwing up, use this to your advantage.   Stick to your guns! If you say you're going to fine someone if they break something/don't do a chore, DO IT. If you don't, kids will walk all over you and nothing you say will ever get done by anyone but you. Hold everyone responsible, especially your close friends. If you get caught playing favorites and people find out you let your friends off the hook for chores or something, you're going to get so much shit, and it's not worth it.   Buy two ply toilet paper, seriously. You wouldn't wipe your ass with sand paper at your parents house, so why would you want you/the rest of the brothers to do it at yours?  With that, make sure you make it abundantly clear to everyone (live outs especially) that this is their house. They wouldn't destroy their parents house, so why would they do it to their own? This is actually the biggest problem I ran into, and that was a sheer lack of respect for the physical house itself. Kids have the mindset that since its a fraternity house they can treat it like shit, call them out and hold them responsible for it.   At the beginning of each semester talk to the pledges and lay down the law. This applies to both pledges and actives but tell them that if they break something, or see someone break something, to just don't be a pussy and tell you. It's better to know who broke someone so you can get it taken care of (be it fining them, having them replace something, etc.) than to have a giant hole in the living room wall for months because no one would fess up to it.   If you have any other questions let me know."

Frat,3e01ul,PPKA2757,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"For room selection, seniority, by scroll.  Guys worked out roommates on their own, and sometimes switched mid-semester."
Frat,3e01ul,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"So do you guys group roommates together and then decide room location, if so do you just take the average seniority or that of the most senior brother?"
Frat,3e01ul,rutpacmet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:18 2015 UTC,"Seniority within the house. I.e. A fall 12' gets priority over a fall 13' etc. most of the time kids who are living in will have a pretty good idea of who they want to live with. If for some reason a guy doesn't know who he wants to live with/ or there is a lack of guys who want to live in, a lottery is usually held. I charged rent by two factors: how big/nice the room was, and how many people are in it. Example: a double might go for $350/mo while someone living in a single might pay $425/mo. It's something you should work out with the treasurer."
Frat,3e01ul,justinhatguy,10,Tue Jul 21 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"I've posted some of this before, but it may be helpful for you:  On furnishing the House:  Because of the number of Brothers housed there and frequently spending time there, the common rooms for fraternity houses are oversized, even compared to mansions of similar size and price. And so most furnishings, particularly couches, ottomans, club chairs, side tables, coffee tables - they must also be oversized to avoid looking disproportionately small when installed. These common area furnishings also need to be oversized because they will be commonly seating more people at one time than in a similarly sized mansion hosting a reception. Pulling sofas, loveseats, and chairs away from walls and making several different conversation areas in a big room allows others to walk around the outside of these conversation groups.  If there is any possible way, plan for double beds in the rooms, rather than Twins or Twin XLs. Sleeping with someone is much more comfortable in a double (or full) and the double / full mattress is only 15 inches wider than the Twin sized mattress. Buy good quality, firm, pillow-top mattresses - some of the most fun and some of the most essential rest you need will be on that mattress.  Most desks designed for students have inexplicably ignored that more than books and paper has to fit on a desktop. By the time you fit a laptop or desktop monitor and keyboard, plus a printer (if the printer can't fit elsewhere) and maybe small speakers, there is seldom room on a desk for book or paper. Buy the biggest and best desks you can fit into the rooms - after all the primary reason you are in college is to study and learn.  If you can't fit decent desks into the individual rooms, consider a study lounge with sound-insulated walls, large project tables, and comfortable reading chairs.  Keep the study lounge 68 degrees - shown to be the best study temp - the slight chill keeps you from falling asleep reading.  Keep your Chapter's test and quiz files there.  Keep sugary snacks, fruit, juices, and caffeine there (the brain runs solely on glucose).  Assure you plan for enough bandwidth for your house's wifi. Make sure you have enough electrical service to the house for the kitchen, laundry, and everyone's devices.  Assure your hot water heaters or instant hot water systems can furnish enough hot water for everyone to shower at about the same time. Make sure the water line supplying the house is large enough to allow morning showers at about the same time. For every ten guys in the house, you may need one washer and one drier in your laundry room.  No glass tables.  Install smoke detectors that cannot be bypassed, in addition to regular battery powered smoke detectors. The UNC Phi Gam fire on graduation-eve killed five brothers because smoke detectors had been disabled to allow smoking.  Make sure flooring is no-slip - textured tile or wood with textured finish. Carpet won't last.  Make sure all windows can be shaded or curtained - the Dean is always watching.  Leather furniture is much easier to clean than upholstered furniture. It's almost impossible to steam clean vomit or urine or feces from upholstery because the fluids seep below the fabric and into the stuffing and padding. In the long run, leather is cheaper because it can last longer than one year.  If you have a big media room, try to construct tiered seating like in a movie theater, and install long couches rather than individual seats.  We actually used the blueprints for our house and marked out every room in full sized dimensions in a field, then we marked out the size and position of prospective furniture - with the furniture's accurate dimensions. It took an entire weekend to do, but we avoided some big mistakes that would have only become apparent when the furniture was bought and installed.  Make sure doorways are wide enough (and tall enough) to easily move furniture in - oversized couches require oversized doors.  Every summer: fertilize and re-seed lawn - water daily and cut weekly, touch-up paint damage inside and out, move furniture and refinish wood floors - steam clean and scrub and chlorox tile floors - steam clean rugs and carpets - detonate tactical nuclear device in bathrooms (or steam clean, scrub, and chlorox), replace damaged doors and sheetrock, clean kitchen to restaurant standards (steam clean, scrub, chlorox tile floor, clean equipment inside and out, verify fridge and freezer temps, verify steam table temps), get kitchen inspected during summer to identify problems in the offseason, powerwash and steam clean basement, powerwash and reseal decks, powerwash outdoor walkways and paving stones and outdoor grills, clean and service pool.   Steam clean and Fabreeze all upholstered sofas and chairs. Clean and treat all leather sofas and chairs - spray Fabreeze under leather sofas and chairs to treat smells in lining.  Powerwash windows and exterior of House. Check light bulbs and replace as needed. Update wifi speed - most individual users' bandwidth needs grows at 50% per year (Nielson's Law). Check fire escape plan and replace smoke detector batteries.   Rugs, carpets, sofas, upholstered chairs generally last two years in a fraternity House, then need to be replaced. Interior paint generally lasts two years - exterior paint four years. Pretty much anything in the basement or party room has to be replaced every summer. Repaint / re-varnish and polish front door and hardware and sign - first impressions matter. Replace oversized American flag and oversized fraternity flag for flagpole every semester.  It's an important job - your Chapter's comfort and image rests in your hands."

Frat,3dsp52,fender0044,2,Sun Jul 19 02:58:57 2015 UTC,That's another thing I was wondering. We would have to ship the pallets to a distributor's warehouse and then pick it up from there correct?

Frat,3drdmf,rabbifuente,6,Sat Jul 18 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"You can do that as well, but the benefit of being a legacy is basically being ""fast tracked"" into the organization and that is enforced by the nationals. If you don't let the national organization know you're a legacy then they'll have no idea about you and if the guys in that house don't love you or have super high standards, etc. and don't give you a bid it won't matter because you're just another guy to the nationals.   In short, legacies matter to the national org. not so much to individual chapters so to get your dividends let the nationals know."

Frat,3drdmf,RegressToTheMean,-7,Sun Jul 19 15:17:01 2015 UTC,It all depends on the fraternity. Some people care more than others. As a rush chair I only care about you being a legacy if your dad was in my fraternity at this school and I think he will donate money. Last semester we didn't bid an active's brother and we've turned away a lot of legacies.

If you didn't have a good reason, I'd blackball you and probably everyone from your chapter from any employment opportunities. It's likely that the guys I'm close with would do the same.

Frat,3drdmf,nmhunate,6,Sun Jul 19 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"No disrespect, but my job is to think about now. If you were just here for 4 years three decades ago and haven't been a contributing alumni, what more consideration do you deserve than anyone else? If I went in for a job interview I wouldn't expect preferential treatment because you were in my chapter long before I was born. In fact, you'd be a pretty shitty recruiter to judge an applicant based on something a trivial as Greek affiliation instead of merit and qualifications. I'm not going to address that dumb threat at the end. Now if you have been a contributing alumni, then we'll give your kid some leeway. However I'm not going to bring in a complete derp because his dad pledged, it not fair to my chapter"
Frat,3drdmf,Damngladtomeetyou,7,Sun Jul 19 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"During my active time we turned away a handful of legacies as well, but they were typically strange characters and their related member to the chapter (ie: father, brother) didn't make any effort to address the chapter whatsoever.   I genuinely think, though, that if a father or brother makes an active effort to have their legacy join the fraternity and they reach out to the undergraduate chapter with an introduction, etc. it should be given very, very serious consideration. If the undergraduate chapter chooses not to bid them, they should have the balls to tell that individual in person the reasons in which why they will never be able to put a pin/badge on their son or brother. If they have a fair reason why and they don't pussyfoot around telling the brother/father/whatever to their face, then go for it.   Basing legacy decisions on how much money their alumni connection has donated seems to be a pretty shitty measure to me, though."
Frat,3drdmf,nmhunate,11,Sun Jul 19 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"Then, in my opinion, you are missing the larger picture. Your undergrad years in a fraternity are the most memorable. No doubt about it. However, the longest part of your affiliation is as an alumnus. Networking is a huge and important part of joining a fraternity.   Look, if have two candidates that are closely matched and one of them is a Phi Tau, who do you think is going to get the nod? I have the choice of being an investor in a start up and one of the finalists is a Phi Tau who do you think gets the edge up? If a Phi Tau that I don't know cold calls me needing an introduction, I will not immediately dismiss him and in fact I'll listen to what he needs. I'm not saying you should take my son if he sucks. If he does, I'm probably well aware of that fact. However, the common courtesy of a call or an e-mail goes a long way.  I may not directly contribute financially to a specific chapter outside my own but I do help other chapters in different ways. It's a general understanding of brotherhood that there is reciprocity. At the end of the day we are brothers and that should matter for something. We could have joined any club to party or do philanthropy, but we didn't. We joined a brotherhood and to me, that's a lot different  Shortsightedness doesn't do anyone any good..."

If it's not too late, leave the price tags on the items so everyone knows you have money, cause that's frat as fuck. Make sure everything is as brand name as possible, and have logos displayed at all times.   And how long are the inseams on those shorts? Shorter is always better. In fact, we had a guy show up with shorts so short they actually went upwards and covered his stomach instead of his legs. Instant bid. And layer your clothing. It helps reach the 200 dollar mark, but rememeber that is a minimum. If you have a good Ralph Lauren button down, put a Brooks Brothers polo on top of that, then throw on a cashmere sweater, you're golden.   Also, buy a lot of stuff with the fraternity you are rushings logo on it. We love seeing the dedication from pledges. A potential was wearing a iPhone smartwatch (We don't count smartwatches towards the 200 dollar minimum, btw. It'd be cheating, obviously) and had it set so if he wasn't using it the watch displayed our letters. That potential became our chapeter's president that night.   Don't be too social on your first night rushing, sorta just stand in a corner of the room wearing sunglasses, smoking a cigar, and drinking a glass of wine. Everyone will be impressed, and you'll give off the frattiest of auras. Answer questions in as few words as possible, to show the brothers you're not mute, but you're not a tryhard.

This also has a plus of making them closer. When they pass a test, reward them with beer and music.     Treat them with respect during non hazing situations. But if they disrespect you or misbehave, guess what? It just became a hazing situation. Take them into the bathroom and have them do wall sits or bows and toes. And tell them to never disrespect you again.  The important thing is to build them up and knock them down, not just one or the other."

Frat,3dl2e7,nickthegenie,16,Fri Jul 17 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"Former Academic Chairman / Assistant Pledge Master for two years here.  First of all, when recruiting: Make sure they're motivated to do well. Make sure they're not blowing smoke up your ass and saying, ""oh well, yeah I love school (GIVE ME A BID)"" by watching them carefully while they're rushing/pledging. Pick up on how well they manage their time. If they sit around and play xbox while they're supposed to be doing homework, they're not motivated. Tell other brothers to be on the lookout for this shit as well. If you're lucky, you'll have brothers that are in the same classes as them. Interviews with exec board of the fraternity are good for finding out who are the real quality guys. Ask questions that pry into their devotions. If they don't seem promising, ice that rush to the next semester and give him a chance to prove his grades. You don't want them dropping out as soon as they make it through. During pledging, we mandate our pledges to do 10 study hours per week signed off by a brother, faculty librarian, or tutor. Give us proof or else you'll be sorry. (Which WILL SUCK for the rest of your pledge brothers as well as yourself if we find out you forged them)  After recruiting: If their GPA plummets, stop that shit. Force them to go get a tutor for their classes whether it be another brother, or other means. Make sure they log those hours and have them signed by the tutor if they don't comply. We've barred bros from partying at the house before if they don't get their grades up. First priority is doing well enough to not be kicked out of college due to academic dismissal. It looks bad on them, which makes it look bad on the brotherhood. For those under a certain GPA, we've implemented fines for them skipping classes if we found out.   ""No, Bill. You can't skip class to play golf with us when your GPA is 1.5. Get your shit together because we love you.""  REWARD GOOD ACADEMIC BEHAVIOR. This can be left to your imagination. One example is getting most improved brothers some sweet set of custom lettered shirts that no one else can obtain. Highest GPAs in the house can also be given the same. The back of one of the shirts for our highest GPA brother says, ""Brother Most Likely to Buyout Your Shitty Small Business.""    TL;DR - Don't recruit retards. But if you do, there might be something that can be done about it so that you're not the one to blame.  Edits: I added stuff to recruiting, and created a rewards section."

Frat,3dl2e7,1stonepwn,5,Fri Jul 17 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"Consider delaying Rush until Spring Semester of freshman year.  Likely, this would have to be a campus-wide IFC decision, or other Houses would rush the Fall Semester freshmen and your fraternity would be left with the Spring left-overs.  Give freshmen a semester to get acclimated to the more rigorous college course work and the more extended and more focused study habits.  Many freshmen sailed through high school and sadly expect to sail through college, only to find themselves truly academically challenged for the first time.  College may be the first time many freshmen have found the need to truly study in order to excel.  By giving freshmen the fall semester to get acclimated to the college workload, they can develop a study routine that works for them before they layer atop their academic work the significant time and focus commitment of pledging and fraternity life.  This strategy may also improve a fraternity's risk management profile. A USA Today study found that 47% of all undergraduate campus deaths are freshmen, and that freshmen represent over half the deaths from falls from windows, balconies, and rooftops.  By giving freshmen a semester to acclimate to college before rushing, the fraternity may be safer as well.  Longer term, rush kids for whom a good undergraduate academic record will matter.  If a kid wants to be a lawyer, doctor, dentist, vet, or MBA, then the NEED for a good undergraduate GPA in challenging coursework will drive his study habits - the fraternity won't need to be paternal in supervising that study time.  Those kids will study because they NEED the good grades to get what they want out of life.    If your House is large enough, have a sound insulated library - with all your test and quiz files stored there, with big project tables and comfortable reading chairs.  That gives Brothers a quiet place to study and gives the House a place to enforce Pledge Study Hours if you choose to do so.  Remember that enforcing Pledge study hours is only academically effective if the Pledges have enough sleep before study, or enough caffeine, or both.  If Pledges don't already know this, multitasking is a destructive myth.  You cannot have your focus interrupted every three minutes by a text or email or call, and get anything approaching thoughtful work accomplished.  If you have Pledge Study Hours, make the pledges check their phones at the door and shut down laptop messaging programs.  Study works best with uninterrupted focus.  Have the room temp at 68 degrees - shown to be the best temp to study and avoid falling asleep.  Have fruit, juice, and caffeine in the library to feed the brain and to keep focus sharp.  Monitor early quizzes and assignments to get the earliest idea of who will need tutoring or extra help.  The primary mission of college is your education.  The fraternity can make you a better man, but only you can make you a better student."
Frat,3dl2e7,RobinIsAGoodfellow,5,Fri Jul 17 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"A pledge is useless to you if he fails out after a semester, so academics need to be stressed.   Study hours are a good start. Require that your pledges (and eventually even brothers under a certain GPA maybe) to get attendance verified weekly by their professors. It takes 2 minutes to get it signed off by a prof- unless it's a huge lecture without attendance obviously. If their midterm grades look low in a class, require them to attend extra university-offered study sessions/tutoring for that course, and meet with the professor weekly/bi-weekly. I'm a firm believer that if you go to the vast majority of your classes, know your professor a little bit, and aren't a complete moron, grades will improve.  Do you guys require pledges to interview the actives? If so, consider making one of the required questions for them to talk to each brother about his school routine. Older brothers especially are at the point where they know how to get through classes. The pledges generally only see most guys at the house/parties/not doing school work, and it's very easy to mentally associate seeing some guys around a lot with ""they must be doing as little school-wise as I am, and they're fine."" What they don't understand is those guys are the ones usually waking up early, doing work, going to class, doing more work, and then having the nights to let loose. It will help them get perspective on the work that goes into college."
Frat,3dl2e7,Keep_going_on,4,Fri Jul 17 11:57:30 2015 UTC,"Current Chapter President:  Background: Our chapter is the largest fraternity on campus, with the 3rd highest GPA (Top 2 are small chapters). 3 semesters before this, we were one of the lowest.   A lot of it has to do with recruitment, but aside from that, we do a few things.    A lot has to do with recruitment. Plain and simple, don't recruit (too many) idiots.  During pledgeship we make sure none of the new guys get fuck ups for bigs, because a bad influence can negatively affect the rest of their college experience, especially if they are incoming freshmen.   We have a big/little study program that we just implemented. A certain amount of study hours are required to be with your big. This kills a few birds with one stone. We incentives making good grades. Make a 4.0 get $100 off your dues. 3.75 gets $75 off. 3.5 gets $50 off. This is a decent amount being our dues are $525/semester. The scholarship chair runs this ""scholarship"" program.  If you don't make grades 1 semester you're on academic probation. If your GPA that semester is below a 1.5 you're on SoPro. If you don't make grades 2 semesters in a row, you have an expulsion hearing in front of the chapter (usually just a come to Jesus meeting). 3 semester in a row and it's an automatic expulsion no questions asked.

Have someone give a presentation at a chapter meeting, and encourage members who feel that they have symptoms visit a doctor.   Also use sites like Rate My Professor and be sure that those who are struggling take easy classes. A lot of GPA comes down to your course schedule. If someone is struggling and has to take a class like calculus to graduate, have them do it at a community college.   It's absurd that Greek life even has minimum GPA's. A 2.5 as an engineering major is much different than a 2.5 as a gender studies major. It locks those who actually challenge themselves in school out of the system.

Frat,3dl2e7,miraistreak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:55:37 2015 UTC,The way we do it is that pledges have 4-6 hours a week of mandatory study hours together with pledge ed and pledge master for 2-3 days a week. extra study hours when they fuck up or don't know their shit.  And then for brothers their gpa determines how many study hours they have to do. Our semester gpa is pretty good the past few semesters so we only have to self report those hours. Otherwise you would have to study with another brother for those hours. Usually we send out a survey at the end of the week asking for hours completed.  For brothers and pledges we do monthly grade checks with our academics chair who after chapter will sit down and look at all their classes grades. If you don't meet the gpa requirement (changes every once in a while)  you miss all social activities until you can bring an exam or a big assignment that shows improvement.  People who don't meet the gpa requirement for the semester get put on social probation where they miss all socials but can still go to dated events.   We've held top chapter gpa for over a year and are currently in top 3 consistently at our school
Frat,3dl2e7,nirmalspeed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"A combination of positive and negative reinforcement that mainly applies to actives. Our scholarship chair sets up an academic plan with each brother where a goal GPA for the term is set. It's subjective, based on a brother's individual capability, but it's capped at a 3.6/4.0. So, if ""Billy"" has been putting up 3.7's on the regular, he can set his goal for a 3.6 or even a 3.75 just for shits and giggles. ""Jake"", on the other hand, has yet to break a 3.0, so the scholarship chair will encourage him to shoot for a 3.1 (and come up with other plans to achieve this). The end incentive is sort of petty - $15 reimbursed for dining out - but it's icing on the cake for a term well done.  The negative reinforcement isn't quite as a structured. It's basically public shaming - casual shitting on brothers with poor GPAs (""how's calc 1 going the third time around?"") - and it happens anyways. Our chapter doesn't really struggle academically so I don't know if this actually works, but it's amusing for the rest of us.   The easiest thing to do is not recruit idiots."
Frat,3dl2e7,SpartnPride,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"My chapter did a program that we called ""the academic draft"". Basically our academic chair would pick 5-6 strong academic students to be team leaders (you guys may need more depending on chapter size). The team leader would then meet and pick out an equal number of members each to make up each ""team"" consisting of 7-8 guys. These teams would be balanced depending on how strong the students are in an attempt to avoid teams with all jackasses vs teams with all geniuses. We would randomly pair teams 1 vs 1. Each team would then compete for the highest GPA every two weeks. The team that has the highest overall GPA in each 2-week period would get a free dress at the next meeting. It wasn't much but it worked. Then at the end of the semester, the team with the most wins would get a free dinner at a restaurant of their choice. We saw an overall chapter GPA improvement from 3.01 to 3.19. Not a huge jump but it definitely helped.  Also, recruit kids motivated to bust ass in both the classroom and in the fraternity.   Edit: also, we factored pledges into the teams of actives. This helped motivate them to get their grades up."
Frat,3dl2e7,SouthOfReddit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:18 2015 UTC,This sounds like something that would be fun and get results. How did you calculate GPA during each 2-week period? Just an average score of any homework/tests taken during that time?

Frat,3dl2e7,rdconrardy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea of a formal study hall required for pledges as proposed by some of the other uses.  Due to the structure of classes at our college we don't have a long pledging period like most of you do, but we do have a very long rushing period.  Generally we ask that anyone wishing to pledge send us their grades so that we can make sure they are above our minimum GPA requirements.  If they are not, or are close to being under we inform them and offer help, usually in the form of older fraternity members who have participated in the subject before to offer tutoring.  We also offer this option to active members who fall behind on their GPA and risk coming below the requirement.   I am unsure how your fraternity is structured, but I assume you have an academic chair.  If not I would suggest proposing a change to your constitution that would create one, as it would help formalize and make changes such as this easier and perhaps would make more people open to changes made for academic purposes. Our athletic chair often organizes everything from keeping track of everyone's GPA once a semester, to organizing what we call ""Colloquia"" where once a month we invite a professor, student, faculty, or someone who is skilled in their field to give a speech on their specialty.  This is useful because it not only encourages learning during the talk, but it creates a desire to learn more. In addition to that we enact punishments if member's GPA falls bellow the academic threshold.  Usually simple punishments like restricting their ability to participate in events, if someone does not raise their GPA back up they risk deactivation. At the same time we reward good academics, usually at our Formal or Semi-formal dinners we hand out awards and recognition, especially to those who:  ""a. Being named to the Dean's List b. Receiving an academic award c. Maintaining active membership in any National Honorary Society. d. Increasing one's grade point average by .01 over the course of a semester.""   Finally while my fraternity does not do this, my father's did. They organize what they called ""Study Buddies"" and during pledging would pair two people together, and encouraged them to help each other study during their free time, as well as help each other with other pledging events.   Once active members the Study Buddies were reorganized so you were usually paired with someone who was in the same field of study as you.  (Sorry this part is kinda vague, as we don't do it I'm not 100% on how the specifics went).    I hope this is helpful to you and provides some ideas."

We here all obviously know that being involved in Greek life is a strong sign of leadership, but if the person who's interviewing me is a SJW, I'm not going to bring up Greek life. It's generally a good idea not to go around giving employers a potentially negative first impression.

They were in HR, the guys who gave me the jobs were the owners. In the interview I was asked what I do on campus and outside of kick boxing, the only thing I do is being involved in Greek life. So that was my immediate answer. And the two interviewers mentioned that the boss was in Greek life, we went about the rest of the interview, and then she called him in.  So it was a shot in the dark. The interviewers could have been total SJW or not.  Side note: Only reason I didn't know the owners were involved in Greek life was because it was my 6th/7th interview in two days and companies started to blur after the 4th."

As it turns out, it was Mike’s down the hall. But this is discovered long after the case is gone, and you’re fairly certain Mike has your phone charger anyway. Mike decides to declare “Roommate Tax” that bottle of Jim Beam that a brother left who doesn’t live at the house, turns out it was Ben’s from downstairs.

Grief counseling and depression counseling are always available for the affected, I think that's an important note. Never be reserved in seeking grief counseling or advertising it.      The common move in posterity has been to establish a scholarship, often times larger chapters will also reach out to the family, but in truth the best way (in my opinion) to remember a fallen brother is continue by doing your best to exemplify their best characteristics in your everyday actions.

I couldn't walk to the house at the time because of a sprained ankle and I had let a friend borrow my car so he said he'd just come get me. When he said that I knew something bad had happened. I thought at first it was something bad our chapter had done or we were getting booted from campus. When he picked me up I told him I couldn't wait to just get to the house and he told me. I was devestated. We were close and I was the one who recruited him. However he was really close with his big brother and I felt worse for him.  Anyways in a suprising turn of events our Nationals came out of the woodwork in support. They rented us a coach bus to take us to the funeral and wake.  They provided a grief counselor that I guess they have on staff (no one talked to him though, the school sent some as well and they were received the same).    They also contacted us about honorary initiating hid father. National policy is very strict on honorary initiations as they are no different than our traditional initiation.  He accepted.  The Greek community at my school was ridiculously awesome. Whole houses came by to just politely pay respects and the sororities baked so many goddamned cookies.  It was truly terrible but at the same time I think everyone handled it respectably and appropriatley.

The first was diagnosed with cancer the year before I came to college and he's been in and out of school through that because of chemo and all that stuff. He died of pneumonia this past spring. We were all shocked too because it seemed like he was finally making strides in his recovery and it came out of left field. A few of the brothers that were closer to him went to his funeral to console their family but it was still terrible losing a brother like that.  The other alum, none of the active brothers knew him even though he was only maybe 3 or so years older than us but we sent the family of him a letter to help them with their greiving."

My only pledge brother and I (who drove to make this comeback) had different philosophies on how we should recruit. The smarter answer was to not pigeon hole yourself by only talking to guys that you think fit the right mold of your fraternity. If we only talked to a certain group or type of guy, we'd be a dead fraternity. We spread our recruitment out and talked to as many guys as possible. With some luck, we got many guys interested in joining a fraternity they could make a difference in NOW instead of down the road, and were able to pick and choose who we wanted"
Frat,3d89vc,Imbiggerthanyou26,14,Tue Jul 14 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"When I pledged 3 years ago my alpha was at around 22 active members. The average chapter size on our campus was around the 50-60 range. Now we're sitting at about 45 and on track to get our biggest pledge class ever.   What honestly drove our growth was one guy who was really passionate about recruitment. He was a born salesman and worked really hard to get us those big numbers for a couple of years. We also threw regular parties and built a solid reputation through our interactions with our guests which helped get our name out there on campus. Unfortunately he was more focused on numbers so the quality of the pledge classes definitely suffered slightly during that growth period, but now we're at a comfortable place where our survival as an alpha isn't in jeopardy and we can afford to be as selective as we should be.   You have to learn how to sell yourself as a chapter and communicate value to your rushees. Sit down and analyze your chapter's strengths and weaknesses and figure out how to communicate that in a way that is appealing to rushees. For example, the fact that your chapter is small compared to others might be considered a weakness, but you can actually turn that into a strength by talking about how due to your small size you are able to have a much more personal relationship with every brother that chapters with 100+ brothers won't have."

Frat,3d89vc,tsax2016,2,Tue Jul 14 11:27:35 2015 UTC,"I can understand that point of view because that's how a lot of our alumni feel. Although it can be dangerous to enforce a membership limit, because just one or two semesters of poor recruitment can set you back a lot and it's not easy to recover from that. The semester after I pledged we initiated about 10 guys but probably 75% of them ended up becoming inactive within a semester or two so it wiped out any progress we had made that year. If you're going to enforce a limit try setting it a little higher than you're initially comfortable with so you can at least have a bit of a buffer."

Frat,3d89vc,UnDakotable,5,Wed Jul 15 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"I'm at a Big Ten school, so there are over two dozen chapters. That makes the recruitment game really tough for some chapters that have a third of what the big players do. I see some great recruiting on both ends of the size spectrum, and it really comes down to showing what makes your chapter different, and being as proactive as possible. For one example there was a chapter, starting two years ago, that has really killed the recruiting game. I think what they did best was understand what they bring to the table, that others don't. They don't try to act like one of the 110 man chapters; those guys have rushes come to them. This was a group of 28 members who went out, found a ton of guys to talk to, and told them what the advantages of being in a super close-knit fraternity on campus. I think it did a lot for them. They were sitting at about 65 before graduation in May.  My chapter is about 90, and we see a fair number of guys go to smaller chapters because they feel like the connections would be more personal.  So, like the guys below said, find what your chapter brings to the table and sell that to every guy you see who you'd want.  Best of luck man, you got this."
Frat,3d89vc,HanaHonu,3,Tue Jul 14 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"Numbers game. Meet as many people as you can... and not just by throwing fraternity/rush events.  Look at where freshmen typically gravitate to on your campus when they first come. Yes, a lot of kids go to state schools knowing they want to join a fraternity, but the vast majority of people who end up going Greek never planned on it.  What are the other student organizations that a lot of freshmen are joining? What major events does campus hold that dorms will be urging kids to go to? Send your members to these things. Guys don't have to join the other organizations if they don't want, but every group wants members so it's not like they'll be shunned.   Use those events to meet guys/make friends on an individual/small group level, then slowly introduce them to the fraternity. Make plans with your new friends to do something with a few brothers and their new friends (sports/gaming/event/whatever y'all are into). This could be at the house or on campus... but the focus should still be on getting to know them.  Then introduce them to the fraternity aspect. They've met you, met some of your brothers, and you know enough about them to sell them on the fraternity.  Feel free to mix in social activity with this obviously.  The other big thing to realize is that it does not take long for kids to get in a routine once classes start. You get in your stride of when you go to class/eat/sleep/homework/party/whatever. The earlier you can meet guys and make yourself/your brothers/ your fraternity part of that routine, the better- it will feel a lot more natural for them to want to join."

Without exaggerating I can tell you we, and other houses, would throw 200 person parties and be at the point of turning people away.  You need to do covert advertising in the dorms.  It never hurts to recruit a sorority to advertise with you.  Also offer to let a sorority sell jello shots or some additional beverage and work out some profit sharing guidelines.  You need to run VERY tight shifts with a rotation.  But most importantly you need to care about your guests.  Make girls feel comfortable and safe. Make the environment fun and be glad you have attendees.  We would usually run a kick-out around 12:30-1 so we could actually enjoy our night and have a bit of an after party. There's always gonna be a few who are unjustifiably mad they are being asked to leave, but so many students would thank us at the door.  We worked with the school and gained re-recognition and some of this has changed slightly.  I have since graduated and don't attend Friday night functions.  I'm sure things have changed slightly, but not much.  Really we just have higher active numbers now.  The reason I went into all that detail is because the best advertising you can do for your parties is to advertise during a current one for the next one.  Make people want to come back.  Also, turning people away at the door due to max capacity is the best advertisement of all.  edit: Added last few sentences."

Frat,3d9r0i,cda112093,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:23 2015 UTC,Is it common at your university for the off campus frats to pair? My chapter was thinking about it because we are so small and don't have quite enough money to throw rangers on our own every weekend
Frat,3d9r0i,Throwaway25713,2,Tue Jul 14 21:29:52 2015 UTC,Mine is all off campus. Some times houses can mix and throw joint events. We did it for Halloween and so did others. Everyone is mostly on their own though. If you do plan a joint function make sure you book a decent sized space (maybe 500-1000 capacity). Also idk the dynamic of your school but some houses here didn't get along too well. You'd have to make sure there are some brothers on both ends who are friends and can help get everyone else to mesh.

Frat,3d988p,daswagmonsta,8,Tue Jul 14 14:18:30 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about the community's rep, why would you serve alcohol at a philanthropy event, perpetuating the stereotypes of Greeks as alcoholics? Even if no one is getting drunk, from the outside, it looks like you guys couldn't even go a few hours without a beer. I'm not saying that's what it is, I'm just saying that's how its going to look to someone outside of the community."
Frat,3d988p,ljstella,0,Tue Jul 14 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I was mostly afraid of, but the rest of the committee insists that it will bring more people to the event and it will increase the money that we take away from this"
Frat,3d988p,jorboyd,3,Tue Jul 14 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting subject that doesn't have a clear-cut answer. Now that I have graduated and gone to dozens of philanthropy events as an adult. ALL of the adult philanthropy events have alcohol, most of them having an open bar. The reason they do this is to attract as many people as possible. Alcohol WILL increase your profits and attract more people, no question.   The problem is, your national bylaws specifically state that you cannot serve alcohol at a philanthropy event (I know because I am also a Sammy). Some people will frown upon having alcohol at the philanthropy event and could get you in trouble if someone decided to let your nationals know. The thing is, nationals has better things to worry about than people drinking to raise money for the Judy Fund.   All in all, having 3rd party alcohol served only to 21+ isn't really a PR nightmare. It really isn't a huge issue, but you have to make sure that it is supplied by a 3rd party and that your IFC on campus doesn't have a rule against it. You don't want a surprise fine from IFC just because you want to bring more people.   Hope this helped!"

We flew in an artist, put him up in a hotel, and hosted the concert at our house.  We donated all proceeds to our philanthropic beneficiary.  The concert lasted like three hours, and the minute it hit the three hour mark, the philanthropy was officially over and the unaffiliated day drink began.  Keep it like this, don't mix philanthropy and partying, nationals, the community, and the press might get too mad."

But I think it's definitely a good idea. It should help your turnout tremendously and as long as you communicate with them well, the liability should be on the vendor. Make sure that they're the ones checking IDs (or ""checking IDs"") and they're the only ones to handle the alcohol. It's literally their job to do events like this, so if you give them time to plan, it should be easy."

Haze. Don't want to expend the emotional capital on caring about the wellbeing of your pledges? Haze.  We have mandatory study sessions for pledges. We have weekly quizzes on national Greek/chapter history. We have a set of tasks with explicitly perameters that must be completed within a set period of time (the meat of pledge education falls within these activities). We have mandatory interviews with brothers. We have a final test which requires a 99% to pass.   And we make it very clear that if they aren't up to snuff, if they aren't showing up to Skull Sessions or contributing to the planning and executing of their tasks, if they fail too many quizzes, they get black balled. It's that simple. There's no need to threaten them with wall sits or make them run a mile. All that does is prove that they can do wall sits and run a mile. You want to make sure you're only initiating guys who respect the process and value the fraternity? Then threaten them with not being able to join. The ones who don't care won't show up, and that's no skin off your back because by the end of it all you'll be left with a core of pledges who give a damn and busted their ass proving it to you.  TL;DR: clearly communicate your standards and hold the pledges to them. If they fail, give them a stern talking to to let them know you're serious. If they continue to fail, black ball 'em.

Frat,3d1mr9,Impune,3,Mon Jul 13 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"Most of the 44 State anti-hazing laws restrict the definition of hazing to acts which ""physically endanger"" the student, so Impune's philosophy would not run afoul of most State anti-hazing laws.  http://www.stophazing.org/laws/states-with-anti-hazing-laws/   But most fraternity Nationals and most colleges enforce a MUCH broader definition which seems to include ANYTHING (including studying, tests, interviews, cleaning up around the house, house projects, anything) which is required of an aspiring or new member to join or advance within an organization.    Impune's philosophy is sound and well thought out, but it might still run afoul of a college or a National's broader definition of hazing.    The ONLY way I know to assure that an activity assigned to pledges or new members cannot be called hazing is to ALSO REQUIRE active brothers to participate in the activity alongside the pledges or new members.  Then, and only then, can the activity be shown to NOT be required for membership or advancement."

We've also consulted to one of the foremost hazing lawyers/judges (an alum of SigEp). Everything we do is in the clear across all jurisdictions.  It's unfortunate if other national organizations or schools put unnecessary restrictions on pledging. Ours has some very specific disallowing, such as ""No Scavenger Hunts."" But we present our school and pledges with a syllabus outlining the process and activities and have never had any issues.  It is important to note, however, that we don't require house cleaning or other trivial but ultimately irrelevant exercises. There are one or two things the Greek Life office have raised concerns over along the lines of, ""Something could go wrong, and you're putting yourselves at risk in the instance that they do go wrong.""

My school is very anti-greek life so there's a mutual understanding between all the frats and sororities that we've got to keep an eye out for one another when the going gets tough. SAE on the other hand are the most disrespectful bunch of freshman pricks on campus, and as a result they struggle with getting any sorority out to a social.

Phi Kappa Theta also used to have a bad reputation, but over the years they were able to turn that around. It's funny how you can see that happen across a generation of students.

Frat,3d0mcj,brown_man_bob,3,Sun Jul 12 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say for a long time it was my chapter. When I first joined my organization we were around 17 members and in rapid decline. We were set to lose even more members the next year, had literally nothing resembling a house, few socials, and terrible philanthropy. In the two years I've joined we've done a lot to improve the chapter and right now I'm trying to keep the momentum going in my second semester as President. We found a house that fits 24 last fall (only filled half of it for this year, the next two years are already full). We managed to double our chapter size and we're looking to have another large pledge class this fall. We've also had a dramatic grade improvement (we went from a 2.5 to a 2.97) and we're becoming somewhat relevant. I go to a small Greek school so it doesn't matter too much, but I think if we can maintain the same level of improvement we saw last year, we could definitely be top house or something close to it. We're known for some pretty good parties because of our space, but we need to get better at socials and figure out how to actually be a fraternity instead of a bunch of guys."

They view the chapter a lot differently than people have viewed it before. The biggest issue from last year was most of the older guys got really burned out (including myself) and basically stopped drinking and going out, and just sat in their rooms and smoked a lot. That mentality has really gone down this summer, and when we have some new guys move into the house,  that dynamic will change again."

You can't deny that in the US, racial minorities have been boned hard economically. So when we have dues from anywhere to the 500-5000 a semester range, the racial and exclusionary aspects of our fraternities comes to light. I can't tell you how many of my friends had to say no to a bid cause they were already working two jobs just to be at school. And this is of course not at all to say white kids can't afford fraternities! I know plenty of dudes who are white that couldn't afford it for the exact same reason. But when you look around the country and see how many minorities can just barely afford college, the system of payment is prohibitive."
Frat,3cub20,RobinIsAGoodfellow,6,Sat Jul 11 02:48:36 2015 UTC,"Why were your friends rushing a fraternity they knew they could not afford to join?  Fraternities are not a necessity of life; neither is college.  We all should make purchasing decisions based on our personal assets, our personal ability to earn over summers and during school, our family's ability to help us with important goals, and our ability to borrow when needed for worthy investments in our education.  My great grandfather could not afford to go to college - much less join a fraternity, but he worked long and hard to assure his eldest son could, and pledge.  My grandfather worked long and hard to assure that each of his sons could attend college, and pledge.  My father worked long and hard to assure that each of his children could attend the very best college at which they could earn admission.  Sometimes earned progress is generational.  The cost of something does NOT imply racism; nor does someone's inability to afford a desired luxury.  No one has a right to expect to be given that which he cannot afford - to do so is avaricious and reflects poorly on their character."
Frat,3cub20,ryguydrummerboy,4,Sat Jul 11 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"I guess you and I just have a different philosophy on money and fraternity - and that's fine. I guess what I'm really trying to get at is that I don't think that anyone who is of true quality of my fraternity and has the desire to join our brotherhood (and vice versa) shouldn't have to go away just because they can't afford it.   As a side note, it sounds like your family has done everything in their power to make sure you get the best you can and that is fantastic. My ancestry was not allowed in most colleges because of the color of their skin. So our generational progress is a bit behind - and that's part of my point."
Frat,3cub20,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:36:25 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point.    But almost all US colleges and universities have been not only open to minorities for two generations (three generations since court ordered desegregation), but a wide raft of affirmative action and financial aid programs have existed for decades to help and encourage minorities to apply, matriculate, and thrive - to help everyone succeed.  Those programs have not worked as well as hoped (results matter) because the fundamentals of too many African-American families have disintegrated since the 1960s when government programs intended to help instead drove fathers away from mothers & children.  And as you noted, generational family encouragement, role modeling, and support are critical to a student's success.  Fraternities have been opening up their membership too (as shown in posts above), though not as quickly.  Fraternities admittedly lagged behind colleges themselves in diversity - but only because the colleges were forced by law and court order, and because fraternities are protected by the Right of Free Association to choose their members as they see fit.  Most rushees would not want to accept a bid from a fraternity who was forced by law or by court to extend that bid (or at least they shouldn't want that - the experience will never be what they had hoped).  My basic premise remains.  Fraternities are a luxury - an important and highly beneficial luxury - but still a luxury.  They are more expensive (often) than dorms because of unnecessarily high insurance costs and because of necessarily high entertainment and adventuring costs.  Accessing that experience at at other people's expense (taxpayer grants, higher dues for paying members) is just deferring the need for families to come together and invest in the best and brightest their family has to offer the next generation.  Fraternities are, at their core, highly competitive meritocracies.  Brothers compete with one another on everything - lift weight, grades, alcohol tolerance, girls, sports, beer pong - everything.  If your less affluent friends were expecting their bid to come with a Special Deal, because of skin color, that none of the other brothers got, they were sadly deluded and did not understand how fraternities work - everyone pulls their weight - everyone is held accountable to the Chapter - everyone is challenged to betterment.  Fraternities work.  But they work only because of the special structure and traditions that have proven to create and maintain the unique fraternal bond.  Tinkering with that epically successful structure and tradition for social engineering purposes is dangerous and risks gutting one of only two leadership academies the United States has to offer."

The next year's pledge class had a Russian, an Englishman, a Nigerian, a Canadian, a Chinese, a Portuguese, more Jews, among others.  I don't disagree that many fraternities at most colleges are predominantly White, but racism is on the decline. It did help that my chapter really takes to heart the ""possessing different temperaments, talents, and convictions"" part of the Spirit of the fraternity."

Frat,3cpjds,TeemoSelanne,3,Fri Jul 10 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"Up until last year ""Herald"", but then we adapted a ""New member Educator"" and slimmed herald's duties down to keeping historical records/knowledge."
Frat,3cpjds,Yohanaten,3,Thu Jul 9 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"Why is it that the person in charge of history and ritual isnt like, automatically the pledge ed, the guy who teaches the pledges the history and ritual?"
Frat,3cpjds,TeemoSelanne,3,Fri Jul 10 05:00:59 2015 UTC,"That's how we used to do it, but we had nationals take a trip down here in the beginning of spring semester and had to revamp our entire system due to some issues with our pledging process and the university. It was also a decision that we thought would better improve the chapter.  Ultimately the herald is still largely involved with the new member education process, almost a co-pilot if you will. But we decided it would be best to have one person in charge of coordinating the classes, grading tests, and setting everything up while the herald focused more on maintaining the history of the chapter. A large amount of people who ran for herald in the past specifically did it to be coordinator of the pledge classes, and were not as focused on keeping the history of what we were doing in the present. The herald still has a large part in what is taught, how it is taught, but also has more free time to document what we're doing. It also helped as it is a 7th exec position, which eliminated ties in voting from an executive standpoint. Now if we have a 3-3 tie it gives our president the opportunity to have the tie breaking vote, which I think is an improvement."

Although most fraternities are diverse in this day and age, TKE has them all beat, at least from what I've seen. The diversity allows for an extremely large advantage in networking for just about any profession you can think of (although most fraternities will have that as well, especially the ones listed above.) A lot of rich history will follow you, along with a really annoying and sometimes true stereotype. Nationals is often the cause of this. They are very obviously money driven and more pledges = more money, regardless of what type of person they are. However, our national conferences are crazy awesome and nationals will do your best to help your chapter with anything and everything as long as you at least pretend to play by the rules.   *Disclaimer: TKE struggles in the south because they lack strong southern tradition that others have (e.g. SAE, KA, ATO, Sigma Nu). Some of the southern chapters try to imitate it but it makes them even worse off than if they just stuck to their guns.  I've also heard nothing but wonderful things about DKE nationals as well, but I'd have to say my final advice would be to go local. Deactivating and joining another fraternity is the about the worst thing ever, even though I'd say you have a great reason to do so."
Frat,3chavi,thatnationalsguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"While our nationals do spend too much effort in trying to grow and expand instead of build upon current chapters, overall I'd say they aren't too bad. When my chapter got into a pretty sticky situation, they had our backs and followed up to make sure we were alright. Reps will spend hours on the phone helping you out, and even travel to smaller chapters to help improve housing and what not. But you're right, going local seems like the best bet."
Frat,3chavi,postgradmess,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"I'll toss my .02 in here. Short of it is, your odds are not very good at all of getting another nationals to take you.  I've seen it happen once, but the chapter was required to start as a colony and recruit new founding fathers then eventually charter.  The questions you'll get- what did they fine you for? How'd they turn their backs? What is constraining your chapter's finances?  What you better be prepared with- history and documents showing that you are 100% in the right. Also be prepared for your current nationals as well as your school getting contacted by any other organizations you approach.  In my time we got calls from a few groups looking to do something very similar to this. All three weren't accepted because our research found the chapter to be very much in the wrong in every case (one had two hazing violations, one wasn't reporting any members to nationals, one hadn't paid a bill in approximately 18 months).  More than willing to help advise more."
Frat,3chavi,Tx59911,2,Wed Jul 8 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"The reason nobody else will take you is because of the mutual agreement among NIC fraternities not to allow initiated members of one fraternity to join another. The reason for this rule is obvious: ritual sharing. Fraternities in the 19th century warred with one another constantly; usually this consisted of poaching one another's members and chapters (Delta Tau Delta v. Phi Delta Theta is an historically huge rivalry). At some point I suppose frats realized it's better to cooperate rather than tear one another down. Of course, this camaraderie is usually absent on individual campuses...."

Also chartering fees are rather expensive (I believe this was mentioned about other fraternities as well)   The only group I know that was able to leave one and join another was back in the day when sigma chi was formed after leaving DKE."

The only group I know that was able to leave one and join another was back in the day when sigma chi was formed after leaving DKE.    So, that was men leaving a certain chapter and forming a brand new fraternity. There was no ""Sigma Chi"" to join, they made Sigma Chi, just like the founders of DKE made DKE. That is not super uncommon. If these guys want to form a new (local) fraternity, they could easily do that.  Last point: they would not be allowed into DKE.

Your money problems aren't going to disappear overnight and a lot of big national operations (I'm talking SAE, SigEp, TKE, KappaSig, etc.) are pretty strict on the financial end because they have a lot of full time staff members. A smaller national org might be a better option because they could be willing to take a flyer on you guys, but otherwise I don't think you're exactly marketable to most nationals.  As far as going underground, I'll just say that you should read your current insurance policy and think about whether you're willing to all expose yourself to liability that would otherwise be covered. We all know that FIPG doesn't really shield you during parties, but your sober events would no longer be covered.  For a local (which is I think your best option) you should look into insurance options and incorporation documents. It's a lot more work on your end, but could get you guys the kind of freedom you're looking for. It would probably require your alumni really ponying up some money but it sounds like they're willing to help.  But no matter what you do, you guys need to fix your money problem before you do anything. Running a chapter costs money no matter how you do it."

My chapter looked into this, since we were tired of paying thousands and getting nothing in return. 1. Another nationals will very likely not take you in. Technically since you have seen your chapter's ritual they will turn you down (it means a lot to HQ kind of people). Plus, as mentioned before, the liability is likely too high for them. 2. We have underground chapters at my school, they do alright recruitment-wise but struggle with sorority relations since the school is getting stricter with PHA girls being allowed to socialize with them.  3. After you get a plan together to improve your finances, your best bet is going local. You're still going to need insurance, probably organizational paperwork, and some sort of alumni support. All of that won't be easy now, but in 2 years you could be in a much better place."

In my 4 years I've seen probably 10 or so transfers from other schools (we are a large state school), and we have only ever allowed 1 to re-affiliate. Large chapters don't have the same concept of brother good across school borders that small chapters often do. It sounds mean but we don't need it, we view nationals as a pain in the ass that steals money from us to help start smaller chapters, not a helpful organization. We also have an established culture and good social standing so adding someone that didn't pledge here doesn't really benefit us."

Frat,3cfk7u,superflossman,11,Tue Jul 7 15:00:24 2015 UTC,"Preface: This turned into my treatise on rush. Tl;DR quantity first then quality.  What is the average size of a chapter on your campus?  If 20 people is in line with the average, then maybe shoot for one more person each year and keep the quality you like.  If (and at many campuses this is more likely) 20 people is below average, focus first on getting numbers up. That doesn't mean bid everyone who walks through your door, but higher numbers will give you long-term security. The benefit of having a small chapter is that you probably don't have cliques, so you're all more or less on the same page about who you want to recruit. The issue is that with only 20 people, you're making half as many touches (initial interactions) as a chapter of 40.   My chapter had recruiting issues (a few years ago, a pledge class closer to 10 than 15 at a school where the average is 18ish). because our involvement in activities outside the fraternity was minimal. We were happy with the people we were bidding, and we all got along well. We made a concerted effort to get people involved in outside organization (mandating that pledges join a club helped), and we had two huge pledge classes with (IMO) decent quality. When we took big classes, we had bigger numbers each year at rush, which meant we were choosing from huge pools and got to pick what we felt was the cream of the crop. We then took a class right at the average size, and (again, IMO) this class had the best quality of any that we'd had in the past 4+ years.  What that last statement means is that I'm admitting that the last class had higher overall quality (in terms of leadership, athletics, game, and that undefinable ""it"" factor) than my own class. That's ok. Because our numbers were so much higher, our rush discussions became a lot more difficult, with brothers saying things like ""I don't know if I would get a bid based on this standard."" That's not a bad thing. If you can swallow your pride, you can help make something you care about, and think is fundamentally good, even better."
Frat,3cfk7u,HooAreYou,2,Tue Jul 7 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"One of our biggest obstacles about meeting rushes is that we're a tiny school (~3000 people), and have a huge proportion of students in greek life. What this generally means is that a lot of the people that are even considering going greek go to other, larger houses than ours. The rest of the student body is generally fiercely-independent GDI's."
Frat,3cfk7u,dddane,3,Tue Jul 7 15:48:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, so we're actually in pretty similar situations then. My school is a little smaller, but yes, the dominant culture is greek. The GDI's probably aren't as fiercely anti greek as at most schools, but that's a moot point.  First of all. You need to remember you're recruiting parents as much as the guy. They're freshman. They listen to their parents even if they claim they don't. If mom really likes your chapter and thinks you'll help her son become a better man, then you're 99% gonna get that guy.   So, how do you recruit parents? You recruit the second they step on campus. If you have students who have tours, get brothers to join that organization. Have them join the Orientation Leaders. Have guys on campus, helping when they have the freshman come onto campus during the summer for various stuff. You don't necessarily want them ""recruiting"", you want them offering a helping hand, and answering questions from the family. Have guys just playing frisbee on a lawn on campus or something. The more the family sees your fraternity doing these things around campus, the better. My school has Greeks help with freshman move in, so we always make sure to take the time to meet and be courteous to the parents.  Now here's the most important parts. Give all of the freshman you meet your number. I don't care if you'd never recruit them, maybe they have friends who you would. Unless they're literally 1.0 GPA how the hell did you get in, you want to give them their number. Don't say ""oh call me for recruitment or something"", make it clear that you are a student who is willing to help their son the first few weeks around campus, answer any questions they have, etc. HAVE THEM THEN TEXT YOU THEIR NAME ""so you don't forget who they are when they call"". Boom. You have their name and number, and you should have gotten to know them during this time. Rinse and repeat all through summer and the first weeks of school, and you'll have a huge list to pull from.  If you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me."

Like sure if a chapter was recently in trouble for racism or hazing, I could see it being a factor, but otherwise, I've always just assumed it was the kids choice.  Maybe I'm just speaking from personal experience, but once my parents decided that they would pay dues, they just did not care which house I ended up at, so long as I was happy"

If you were nice to the parents, she's gonna ask ""oh so how's so and so doing? He was so nice to us. Have you been talking to him? What about his fraternity?""  It's not about the parents making the decision. It's about them reinforcing to their son that hey, maybe they should go and meet these people and get to know them better (and eventually join). I don't care how independent you are, you're probably gonna listen to your mother, if not just to get her off your back."

But past that, most kids that come in have an idea where they will rush (if they haven't already accepted a bid somewhere) and with the ridiculous amount of things throw at you in the first couple weeks, the dude who helped carry your stuff into your room is pretty forgettable; both to potential rushees and their parents."

They talked about how the average pledge class nationally was 20+, etc.  Honestly? Just ignore them. Most nationals have a single plan or outlook on recruitment. Ours seems to not take into account that we're at a smaller school with 5 other fraternities. They don't really have the time to look at situations and conditions like that, so they assume you're similar to all the other schools.  Unless they start to actually threaten you with stuff, keep doing your thing. Pledge as many guys as you think are qualified. What makes them qualified is up to you. For example, (obviously after looking at grades, etc) my chapters main thing for guys we're not sure about is ""Would you feel comfortable having this guy go out in a year and try to recruit, and represent our fraternity during that."" If the answer is no, then you probably don't want to bid them.  TL;DR: Unless they actually threaten to do something or whatever, keep doing your thing. If you want to pledge more guys, do it, but if you're not comfortable with that then don't. Don't worry about Nationals.  IHQ if you read this, don't hate me, that meeting was just ridiculous."

ROTC and fraternity life, when done right, each require large blocks of time to get the full benefits.    Maybe you should consider staggering your three big commitments - starting ROTC with your first semester of your freshman year, but waiting until spring semester of your freshman year to rush a fraternity.  That strategy would give you the ability to assess the time and focus required by your academic load and by ROTC, and it would allow you to develop time management habits and routines to successfully handle the workload.  Many freshmen who sailed through high school without much effort find college requires true time, focus, and effort to succeed.

You aren't respected and do a lot of bullshit that upperclassmen don't do because the ROTC unit is trying to mold you for military life. I didn't rush until my sophomore year and I'm glad I waited to dedicate more time to the fraternity.  Keep in mind ROTC commitments always come first.
Frat,3cefxg,gnarfolk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:28:26 2015 UTC,I plan on going to rush week but depending on how rigorous the frats are will determine if I rush the fall or winter quarter. But I will definitely keep that in mind
Frat,3cefxg,ImMitchell,5,Tue Jul 7 18:09:04 2015 UTC,Depends on how rigorous the pledge process is. It can vary so much house to house that you can't really get a good answer from here. Just know you'll be incredibly busy your first semester.

In my classes case, we switched the day we had our pledge class meetings on in order to accommodate the one guy who was in ROTC. He came to as many events as he could and was initiated with the rest of us. Stay on top of the shit they want you to know so that if you miss a meeting you can do well at the next one and not seem like a slacker."

Realize that ROTC (especially if you're on scholarship) and engineering classes will be your first priorities. Definitely participate in all pledge activities, but don't fuck around like your other pledge brothers inevitably will be doing with all their new found free time.   Both my ROTC pledge brothers were engineers, and both received a sub 2.7 GPA during pledge period and ended up switching majors. One didn't get initiated in the fall and had to get his grades up.  TL:DR It can be done, but for the love of God don't spend even a minute more doing fraternity things than you have to. Pledging can easily consume your life, depending on the house you rush."

Definitely do a lot of fundraising in October (it is cancer awareness month) and do a lot of community based activities such as sponsoring a university event ,my school has some cancer related stuff in October, if yours doesn't try to make it happen with your school's administration.  For fundraising you should do a greek games olympics for your brother and recruit other fraternity and sorority members to ""buy in"" with a donation and to participate in the games(to show solidarity for your cancer fundraiser amongst all greek orgs on campus.) Which will, open up donations from businesses and sponsors in your city, and create more awareness for your initiative.

If you come to one of my fraternity's parties and any of the following apply to you: A) not on the list; B) no one in the frat knows/can vouch for you; C) you're not rushing; D) you showed up with no girls and/or a bunch of dudes; E) you have a video camera (yes, phones and shit, but a legit camera is different) then there's no way in hell you're getting into the party. It's nothing personal, it's just a matter of minimizing risk and liability, maximizing available alcohol, and maintaining the ratio.   As for rushing with both sororities and fraternities, I feel very strongly that not bidding someone solely because of their race is wrong and pathetic. However, there was no evidence given that the aforementioned non-bids were because of race. Joining a Greek organization is about finding the group of people that you can truly relate to, that you look up to and admire, that you want to call your brothers or sisters for the rest of your life; the same goes for deciding who to allow into your particular organization. It's good to have a diversity of people and cultures that can challenge you to broaden your views and grow as a person. But if you truly believe that a person will not be a good fit with the rest of the organization, if you cannot ever call them a brother or sister, then I believe it is your obligation not to extend to them a bid. It's unfortunate but true that there will always be some people in which the core values you live by cannot be instilled - boys who will never become men. In the case of the board member's daughter who was not given a bid, this a clear cut example not necessarily of racism, but of the fact that your parents' accomplishments and positions in life entitle you to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You are your own person, and if you don't fit in with the organization I don't care how much money or power daddy has. You will not get a bid. Simple as that.   Now that's not to say that there isn't a racism problem at 'Bama - I know nothing about the place, and there very well might be - but before the media and these groups of people claiming to be discriminated against jump to any conclusions I seriously recommend doing some legitimate, unbiased research with ALL parties involved in said claims (i.e. talk to the fraternities/sororities about this kind of thing before you make outlandish claims without taking into account there could be any number of reasons for their actions).

Frat,3c8wtd,mathobso,3,Mon Jul 6 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"But there is no truth behind this as far as any evidence can say. I'm not necessarily saying there is or isn't. But just as we know falsely reporting a story of rape doesn't help the cause of anti-sexual assault, neither does unsubstantiated claims of institutionally sponsored racism. And I definitely agree that social media has harmed fraternities. It has harmed any and everyone in an age where news outlets try to collect stories via citizen journalists (on Twitter, Facebook, reddit, etc.), which is not really ever a good thing.   As far as we know, including the Mallets, there is no evidence of such claims but for the opinions of a few. Definitely their cause is one worth fighting for in the broader sense, but when SJW's/people of that type attack a certain group of people because of the way they may make them feel, our ability to engage in civil/political discussions is seriously harmed because of their inability to cope with someone not agreeing with them (I know, it's crazy)."

Frat,3c8wtd,mathobso,13,Mon Jul 6 21:24:12 2015 UTC,Evidence given on how the organizations have specifically tried to bar minorities:
Frat,3c8wtd,Cloud9Ground0,27,Mon Jul 6 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"Lol come on man, given the nature of rush and the bidding process, there doesn't need to be an active form of ""barring"" minorities.  If everyone in your organization is white, and everyone makes the conscious or unconscious decision to not let people of a certain race or other races in, it would simply be a matter of saying ""he/she wasn't a good fit, thats all."".  Of course theres nothing wrong with this, and no one can without a doubt prove that a certain person was cut due to their race without making vast assumptions, which might be true or might not be.  Thats just the nature of the system."
Frat,3c8wtd,mathobso,3,Mon Jul 6 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree with you that the system can be natured towards certain results, but inductive reasoning is highly illogical and inaccurate when trying to pull a theory out of this observation.   By nature our jury system works in a similar, albeit more upfront way. Lawyers have a peremptory strike to remove people who may be in the minority of the result they're looking for in litigation. That system is fundamentally biased, and accepted. The fraternity system will do that based on appearances, yes. But on the basis of race, no. I think we all know that there is a certain kind of man who belongs in a fraternity (shares similar values, interests, career/educational goals), and we can all agree that race does not play into that calculus.  edit: anyone in a southern fraternity that can testify to any racism in the bid process?"

Frat,3c8wtd,Cloud9Ground0,5,Mon Jul 6 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"See I agree with what you're saying, but I think it only holds for Fraternities in a general sense. Of course most fraternities want that certain man you are talking about, but theres enough outliers to the point where we have to address them.  As you stated Fraternities/sororities do base some choices on appearances, but I don't think it's far fetched to say that for certain organizations, usually southern ones, race almost definitely plays a role in one's judgment of rushes. The problem is that there is no tangible way of proving that this is an issue, but for anyone thats on the inside and knows how a rush and bidding process works, you can almost tell how easy it would be to discriminate based on whatever quality you choose. The thing is, most fraternities usually only discriminate against those who don't have the qualities of the ""fraternity man"", so it's not really an issue.  What I'm saying is, I think it's safe to make the assumption that theres definitely racist fraternity/sorority members (or alumni as we've seen in some cases) within chapters at big southern schools, and race does play a role in their selection process. I personally feel that, while it's fucked up, it isn't an issue in the sense that it needs to be addressed or have documentaries made about it. Of course theres going to be groups that only want a specific type of person, whether that has to due with race or traits, but I would say if you don't fit that mold or if they are willing to discriminate against you, they're not worth your time, and you should say fuck them find a fraternity/sorority that is."

We visited a local war memorial, as an example of a good idea that came directly from IHQ.  House projects are a big thing for my chapter. We require two per pledge term. It gives the new guys a bigger sense of pride in the chapter house. Past projects of ours include making cornhole sets, building some extra benches for the front porch, and making a ton of coat racks for the basement. Ditto to the poster who mentioned general house repairs and cleaning. I fail to see how that can be logically considered hazing; if the line that national fraternities push these days is equal status to brothers, then that has to include the same house maintenance and upkeep that any active brother would perform.  We also require one additional pledge class project from them the semester after they're initiated.  If your national fraternity calls pledge class projects hazing, just throw in a few brothers to help them out. Construction and woodworking are generally fun activities, so you should be able to find a few volunteers to help out, or at least to ""supervise."""

For me its all about planning and building them up to execute better throughout their pledgeship. Each week we had a different ""theme."" Such as: scholar week, leader week, philanthropy week,  school pride week, member week ect. Each of these weeks had a different activity that the pledge master (for the most part) planned and left it up to the pledges to execute. each week giving them more lee-way to plan for themselves training them to be good, productive members. But we also had weeks that taught them important values like integrity, morality, how to be a gentleman and how to actually study instead of memorize. Make sure they know why they are doing these things, make sure they know the purpose and make sure and repeat that its not mandatory but that you are giving them the tools to help them succeed and you can do just about whatever you want without the fear of hazing.

Frat,3c8ade,DangleRangus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:33:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of groups I know have their pledges write papers or do presentations about different aspects of the fraternity. For example, if you want them to develop good public speaking skills (assuming you'll want them to be able to advocate for the fraternity at need), give them a topic to present to you on every week. You can make them learn things about the fraternity, check that they've learned it, and make them develop some useful skills while you're at it.  Another good one is to tell them to fundraise. Give them an amount and a deadline (and maybe some rules), and have them come up with the money. Another useful skill, and you can use that to fund other things you want them to do (ie throw a pledge class party or do a pledge class project).  Seems like this was already suggested, but a pledge class project is a good idea. Have them come up with something that benefits either the chapter or the campus and do it. You can also give them something specific, like have them work on a banner that represents their class, a big chapter paddle you can put on display, new chapter letters, design a new recruitment brochure/flyers/backboard, etc.  Finally, one of my favorites is to have them plan some mock rush events and invite the brothers to them. Added bonus: brothers get food from pledges in totally above-ground way xD (assuming you have food during rush, anyway)"

If you were instead looking for something more like a guide, more information about your particular situation would help, namely:   Why do you want a website? Do you have a domain? Do you have hosting? Do you have content?   Assuming you're establishing a web presence for your chapter (for PNMs and/or Nationals and/or whoever else), you'll want to start by getting a domain name - I recommend gandi or namecheap.  Next, you'll need hosting - I recommend eleven2 (if you're tech-savvy or have someone in the chapter who is, and don't need something dynamic like WordPress, you could also use GitHub).  The content that you then put up is up to you - your hosting provider should provide the info on how to upload things.  You'll then connect the domain to the host (maybe use CloudFlare to save bandwidth & mitigate malicious activity), and content uploaded to the server should then be served when people go to your site.  if you're okay spending money, you can hire a web designer/developer to walk you through the process (or do it for you), but if your budget is a constraint and you want to look good while mostly DIYing it, it's doable.   A domain should cost no more than $10/year including email. Hosting should be no more than $100/year (likely less) If you buy a theme through an exchange like themeforest, you can expect that to cost between $15 and $70 one-time, depending on features and licensing.   Hosting and domain registration will be an ongoing cost, but you can get discounts if you do some research. Prices aren't always the same, either, so if you can't find what you want now, try again later.  Doing it yourself is possible if you can take the time to learn HTML/CSS and do the legwork in configuring everything, but you'll probably get the best results by paying a pro (or asking for the help of a brother with relevant experience).  I'm on mobile right now, but I'll update this when I get in front of my desktop with some links.  Happy to answer questions, too."

We have a large tool shed in the back of our parking lot that has two couches in it, brothers are allowed to smoke to their hearts content in there.   In house cigarette smoking is a $25 fine for first offense and $50 for all subsequent offenses.   In house weed smoking is a $250 fine and immediately j board. Weed is a big deal around our campus because IFC does periodic audits of our houses on the weekends and any weed smell is an automatic fail."

If a house doesn't accept you solely because of your physical condition you wouldn't want to hang out with those guys anyway. If you do plan on eventually living in the chapter house though there could be some accessibility problems as not all fraternity houses are wheelchair accessible.

Frat,3byupz,GreatWhite_Buffalo,17,Fri Jul 3 12:06:35 2015 UTC,"Many house's pledging is very physical. Morning workouts, wall-sits, hikes, etc. However, plenty of houses have a minimal amount of that sort of stuff and some have none at all.  The point of this is you should be aware that pledging is the biggest strike against you, since some houses will feel that not being able to participate fully means you shouldn't be given a bid. Once you're on campus, you'll start to learn which houses have which types of pledgeship (watch out for rumors).  Beyond that issue, your disability won't be a problem at all. If it gets you sympathy from girls and counts as some sort of diversity for the administration, maybe it could even help.  I'm real sorry you have to deal with this shit though, I honestly can't imagine dealing with that as a 14 year old."

As for them not treating you with respect: hold a fucking fireside meeting and get your grievances out. Do you guys actually attempt to have face to face meetings to air out your concerns? If not, you are the problem.  In addition, you don't have to ""haze"" your pledges to make them respect you. We don't paddle our pledges or make them drink piss or anything sadistix shit like that.  We treat them like they are our younger brothers. They have to earn our respect but showing they give a shit. If they fuck up in terms if grades, dues, or being a drunk dip shit, they are going to get an earful.  It's not because we want to make them feel like shit, but we want them to be better people.

""Our most recent pledge class has no respect for older brothers, our history on campus, nor for the overall well being of the fraternity.""  Do you not see the link here?  Anything unearned, anything not worked for, anything not sacrificed for - will not be valued.  Compare the value and devotion your current brothers express for your chapter with the value and devotion expressed by brothers of your father's age and your grandfather's age.  And then ask your father and your grandfather what they went through to become a brother.    A crucible pledgeship is required to form the pledge bond.  Without the pledge bond, there can be no fraternal bond.  Without the fraternal bond, you are nothing more than a club.  A crucible is not sadistic; a crucible is not torture - a crucible is a series of maximally difficult physical, emotional, and academic challenges that require the pledge class to work as a team to surmount successfully and to bring every pledge class member across the finish line as a better man."
Frat,3bwwuw,WeArePrettyAlright,5,Thu Jul 2 21:15:27 2015 UTC,"If your not puting kids through a ""traditional education"" program, you have to make them work.

Make them work parties and socials and if they fuck any thing up you have to come down on them whether it is through fines, sober weeks (If you don't have a dry process). When one of our candidates forgets their books the whole class has to go and get that book and come back to the house.

Keep a tally system. Every time a pledge forgets his book, or is late, or really for whatever you deem fit, give them a tally mark. Once they hit five marks (or ten or how every many you decide, depending on how strict you keep it), DROP THEIR ASS. NO EXCEPTIONS. It's not hazing, and it keeps the pledges honest. I did it with my pledge classes when I was educator, and we ended up dropping most of the class. The ones who stuck it out, however, have held multiple offices and had great GPAs, not to mention holding huge roles in rush."

If there's even a hint of them being shitty, drop the one who is screwing up or just drop the worst one overall and tell them they can repledge next semester.   We let our last spring class get away with a lot of stuff, we warned them, then next meeting we just dropped the worst one. They shaped up after that."
Frat,3bwwuw,Justworkhere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of hazing I guess because technically just about anything today is considered hazing. But aside from that, hazing isn't a necessity. The whole point of the pledging process, among other things, is to teach them how to be a better person and what it means to be in a brotherhood.  If there's respect issues with a pledge class, then that shows that they aren't taking it seriously and respecting the process, which to me warrants being dropped. Pledging is a time where you have to drop your ego and understand that you aren't equal to an active, and thus can't act like you are. If a pledge acted like an active with us they wouldn't enjoy the remainder of the process or they'd be dropped. If there's issues with a pledge class that just got in not respecting older brothers, they aren't acting like equals and aren't valuing the brotherhood, and would be warned then blackballed if no improvement is made."

These days they are often associated with the neo Nazis.  That being said, I once chilled out at a fraternity barbecue in Braunschweig (not neo Nazis I believe). It was dope. They had an amazing house. To join, you apparently had to duel a member with a real, actually sharpened sword! They also have this thing, I don't remember what it was called, but you basically do a tour of all the local houses in a day and try to drink however much they challenge you to.

Frat,3brs96,mistahowe,2,Wed Jul 1 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, this is what I heard directly from the brothers that I visited. They brought it up defensively even though we had never even mentioned it, having had no idea at the time. We didn't ask them further questions because it seemed like they didn't want to talk about it more, but I did look it up later.  What you say is only true to the extent that the fraternities as distinct ""Burschenschaft"" organizations were dissolved by the Nazis. The full story is a little more complicated from what I read. Unfortunately, excepting a few of the Catholic houses, most fraternities were used to form the backbone of the Kameradeshaften during the 30's, which were used to indoctrinate thousands of students during the transition to Nazi dictatorship.  That being said, and to your other point, I feel you bro. Many of us in the states have been similarly labelled with regards to the racist, misogynist behaviour of a few fraternities that get media attention. Of course, these deeply disturbing internal issues exist in both fraternal systems, and I feel strongly that they should be acknowledged in both cases. Regardless, I'm sorry if I've unfairly misrepresented you, and I understand the frustration."

You were mean."" I didn't go out of my way to be unnecessarily mean or cruel. I didn't make them do anything physical, I didn't demean them or embarrass them without merit.  But I did take the education process very, very seriously -- if you don't, no one else will. Early on tell them your standard, and let them know when they're slipping below it. Hound them to study, to do their interviews, to organize themselves and complete any tasks you assign.  You can have a challenging and dare I say meaningful pledging process without hazing.

Don't get me wrong, I think the university did all that it could do and it comes down to what the chapter is willing to do, but I think ""that's why I don't feel sorry for them"" is a really dumb thing to say about a grieving family who probably wants answers more than money."
Frat,3bunig,fresh_kicks,4,Thu Jul 2 16:05:02 2015 UTC,"I thought the facts of the tragedy were known: 15 mile pledge hike. No proper boots, just casual shoes. They had water, but not enough. Hike was staged during warmer weather than in the past.  The pledges were offered a ride by a passer-by, but refused.  Coroner ruled cause of death to be dehydration plus hyperthermia (probably meaning heat stroke).  That seems like a consistent cause and effect.    What are the unanswered questions the family is suing to get answered?"

Contact places like wal-mart, coke, budweiser, pepsi, etc. Most of them have specific bugets for things like this within your area. (For example our budweiser plant can spend 10k per year on sponsoring events.)  Then go around to locally owned businesses in the area. Small restaurants, shops, and other places. Ask them for donations in return for putting their logo or name on fliers, signs, or anything else you are using to promote the event."

Frat,3bpij8,fresh_kicks,3,Wed Jul 1 03:51:21 2015 UTC,How big is your chapter? I feel like this would give like a .00001% chance of acceptance statistically speaking
Frat,3bpij8,UW2014,2,Wed Jul 1 14:11:37 2015 UTC,um right now we are around 125 members strong  It's all in how a blackball is used though.  It's pretty rare in our chapter.  They are only used when you have a serious concern (that no amount of discussion will alleviate) with a kid that would otherwise get a bid.  It kinda puts you at odds with the chapter if you use it on someone otherwise popular  most kids who don't receive bids are due to the voting just not going in their favor.
Frat,3bpij8,SamsDesigns,6,Wed Jul 1 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"We have the 5 yes' and you get a bid, 5 no's and no bid. If you get 5 yes' and 5 no's, the 5 no's override the yes'. It's worked well for us and I can only think of one guy we didn't want to initiate in the last 3 years."

Frat,3bpij8,nmgoh2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah we have around 50 guys depending on internships and such (63 actives outside of that). Everyone can vote if they attend X number of rush events, unless excused such as late class or work. If you don't hit the magic number, no vote for you. Some people don't show up to vote either because they have class work to get done (we vote on hours before bid night starts).   Usually about 30 guys show up and it's usually the people who actually got to know all the rushees pretty well so either it's a pretty strong yes or strong no. There's very few guys who are borderline because we have a lot of weird kids at our school and they're easy to weed out (major tech school)."
Frat,3bpij8,Rimmmer93,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Since you're not really looking for a vote, just 5 people you wouldn't need to hold a formal vote at a meeting.  You could just tweak the rush policy to say ""I'm going to shuffle a ton of kids through this house.  If you like one, tell me, if you don't like one, tell me"".    5 Likes gets a bid, and you can publicly post that you're going to do it in a week or two.  Any No's holding out would then have ample time to give you their vote."
Frat,3bpij8,Rimmmer93,4,Wed Jul 1 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"When you elect or appoint your rush chair, you put your faith in them that they will rush the kids who will help your chapter the most.  That may mean having a rush czar (the rush chair is the only one who decides on who to bid) or having the rush committee decide. Having the whole chapter decide is an awful idea. Asking for people's advice on individuals and then taking that into account when writing bids will help satisfy the chapter, while minimizing the amount of ""goobers"" you get."

Frat,3bpij8,Harpo3,2,Wed Jul 1 07:41:21 2015 UTC,"He's probably just not good at arguing lol  Some chapters at my campus have small committees, and others have votes. But the fact is, people are retarded. Often the people looking to hold positions of power are really not the people best suited to do so.. which is why my chapter has a regimented voting procedure and system to try and minimize the time it takes to get through all the rushes while maximizing the consideration that goes into each vote.   All of our brothers are an integral part of rush, and thus they have an obligation to give an input on who receives bids."
Frat,3bpij8,MrSir68,4,Wed Jul 1 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Every time it's brought up I'm surprised to hear that either some fraternities don't have their voting system written out in the constitution/bylaws, or that they don't follow them. I won't comment too freely on our constitution, but we wouldn't have your problem. We have the opposite problem, where the kid's bid gets denied and almost everyone gets buttmad about it (including me tbh).  Some of the other guys have a completely different idea of what a good candidate looks like, and I have to accept that I'm only one opinion. But when a vast majority of people speak up for him, no one voices any negatives, and he still gets denied a bid, that's just shitty.  Since you seem to have a different system, maybe you can just talk about the specific negatives regarding each person you don't like, and hopefully convince enough brothers to vote no. That's democracy.  One last thought, if you only initiate 4 people per class maybe you can't afford to be picky. I understand if it's a spring class, but 11 signed out of 20 handed out sounds weak too."

Frat,3bkckg,bon3rzzz,87,Mon Jun 29 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"First, call the pledges out in lineup. Tell them none of them will ever be brothers if they can't unify. Tell them if they wouldn't sacrifice for their pledge brothers they are weak and an embarrassment and should drop. Be sure they understand that what makes a fraternity man isn't just social skills and a fast shotgun time, above all it is loving your brothers despite their flaws, because they love you and went through the shit of pledging just to prove that love.  Then when the pledges are gone turn it back on the actives and say this attitude started with them. Say that you are proud to be brothers with each of them because they earned it and tell them to always consciously think about how much they value the unity they were supposed to learn in pledging.  Alternatively, if you can't give that 30 second speech to the pledges, just say to the actives ""How are we supposed to tell the pledges to be good brothers when we aren't?"" and then give them the same spiel."

Frat,3bkckg,wut_is_drugs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"Solid and true advice.  Best way to unify the pledge class is to stress the importance of what a true brotherhood is, and that means no cliques/favorites within the line.  Activities that also involve having the line get to know each member a lot more or have to work with all their members as partners can help bring them closer together too."
Frat,3bkckg,Gloots_for_theSloots,12,Wed Jul 1 07:42:27 2015 UTC,"You are facing a gap between older and newer brothers. This gap is being widened by pledge-ship. And the boners aren't helping. If you want to improve brotherhood, you're going to need to get the entire chapter involved for something challenging. Like, grueling, muddy shit. Find the nearest mountain. Or a close one that is big, challenging, and shitty. On a rainy, shitty day, get everyone geared up, and your entire chapter is going to hike up the mountain. There should be complete silence.   Every now and then, stop and pose questions for the entire chapter to answer. Why are you here? Why did you join this fraternity? What does brotherhood mean to you?  By challenging and suffering as a chapter, you'll fill voids, force them to think about why they're there, and to work together, not as classes, but as a brotherhood.  If it goes well, do something similar until you see results. Brotherhood is about suffering together, and climbing a muddy, shitty, wet mountain is a great way to do that. It's worked for others, and it might work for you."

Frat,3bkckg,egm03,6,Tue Jun 30 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Don't let the pledges get away with crap like that, for one. We've given some bids to a few boners in the past (cue TKE stereotype joke here) but most of them that didn't drop got kicked out because they had to unify before they finished pledging, no excuses. Make sure all consequences are spread equally on the whole pledge class. If an argument between pledge A and B caused a rift in the class, then punish the class as a whole.  Make them hang out together outside of pledge nights frequently, and hang with them in a non-hazing, stress free environment. Times like these are when you are allowed to be their friend. Then at the next pledge night, quiz them over each other's hometowns, middle names, favorite foods, etc. It seems pointless but it causes them to talk to each other and learn about each other. Do the same thing for your actives. A problem we had recently was our actives starting to clique up within the chapter. Every week we drew names from a hat and we were required to go hang out with a different brother each week. It helped tremendously and was fun. Failure to comply was punished with loss of voting rights and pledge rights for both brothers. It helped reiterate the group quality that we were looking for.   Sorry for the text wall."

On top of that I usually buy my own 30 and a handle just to walk around with and hand out pulls to people who look like they need more fun.

Tilt keeps everything organized and you can download it into an excel file – all in all it's much simpler.  We use it for everything from tailgates to dues.

The town the school is in passed zoning laws or whatever that prevents frats from actually owning property - instead, there are dozens of rental properties around campus.   We just got chartered last year, so we had a small house, and the landlord had strict rules against charging for entrance.So we have a separate fund outside the formal budget to buy things that we don't want to be buying with the official social budget. Things like decorations and mixers come straight out of our dues through the social budget though."

And that's not including the tip, which is necessary if you want a second drink. It's stupid.  My fraternity would throw massive parties and the most we would pay was $10-15 per brother, and that would be enough to get everyone absolutely destroyed. So yes, I still went to them up until I graduated last year. Now I just get smashed before I go to a bar and maybe order one drink when I'm there.

Frat,3b3oty,speedsam,20,Thu Jun 25 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna toss something out there that we did one spring that actually had a big success, and cost practically nothing because it wasn't ""big"".   If you actually step back and think about it, yeah, some kids will be impressed if you have large event that's cool and all, but the third day of rush week is a little late in the game for that. The big attraction events on the first two nights are great to get guys hyped on your house and an incentive to come check it out, but by Wednesday actually sitting down and talking with the guys so actives can get to know them better (before an invite only, which we can all agree is the most intimate setting to get to know the guys before the final vote is made) and can possibly get a better understanding on who to invite to your last event.   For example, if you had a live band come and play, it shows that you guys like to have a good time, and the money to do so at that, but how well are you going to be able to have a one on one conversation when A. Both actives and rushees are focused on the music, and B. Even if you wanted to have a conversation you wouldn't be able to hold one very well because it's loud as fuck. Sure you could pull the kid aside and talk to him there, but then you'd both be missing out on the entire event because you couldn't be focused on the band at all. My advice? Do something a little less over the top.  We decided that on the night before our invite only event, that we would just have a chill open house night at the house. We had video games (FIFA, Madden, NCAA, etc.) set up on the TV's, water pong tables set up, guys shooting pool all night, pizza delivered, and some guys just hanging out on the couches throughout the house. Basically our president and rush chairman told us that ""we want to give these guys a taste of what we typically do on nights when we're not throwing a party.""   Yeah, some other houses got some more kids to their more extravagant events, but in the end we were able to do three very important things: 1. Got to know our target bids a lot better, and more well known with the majority of the chapter versus just the rush committee. 2. Found some guys that were not on our radar at first, and were able to extend them an invitation (something that might not have happened a larger, more extravagant event). And most importantly 3. Find out that some kids we had our eye on because they put on a solid face at the first two events, were not who we thought they were after an hour or so of real conversation, and subsequently freed their invites to our dinner so they could be used for other kids.  TL;DR sometimes bigger is not always better."
Frat,3b3oty,PPKA2757,4,Thu Jun 25 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"This was one of the major reasons I wanted a bid from my current fraternity. The first night of rushing I was hopping all over the place and it was pretty cool, but when I went to my current fraternity, everyone was just chilling watching the game and playing poker or just sitting on the couch. I got to talk to everyone and I really felt like I fit in. Now, the format wasn't why I wanted the bid, but it helped me see how chill everyone was AND because after talking to everyone I felt like I fit in and these were the type of guys I saw myself hanging out with. By the end of the week I stopped checking out other events and just started hanging out with them during their chill house events."

We also have a bunch of rush parties at one of our senior houses (you can't drink at the house during dry rush).  This gives the rushees a chance to see the social aspect of us, it also gives us a time to see how they are when they're drunk (whether they are creeps/outta control/etc)  Voting is done as a full chapter.

These could be anything from grilling at the house, playing bags, etc. to pickup football games around campus. At the start of it all the rushees will come to tabling events where all the frats have tables set up and guys manning them. We talk to all the rushees, scope them out, get their info, and give them ours and a schedule. Divide and conquer, each person will get in touch with a certain amount of PNMs from tabling. We bring them round the house at the events, and if we like them then we invite them to off-the-book parties (rush is ""dry"") that non-live-in brothers will host. After a few weeks of that we've narrowed it down further and further from what we started with. We do pros/cons and vote as a chapter, and if a guy gets 2/3 then we give him a bid."

My chapter got in trouble a couple years back because football players crashed a party and tweeted all about a ""football party"" at our house, bringing all kinds of people we don't want. Just hope that if they do show up, it's only a small group and not like 15, because there's a good chance they will try to fight if you turn them away. I had a bunch of dents beaten into the sides of my car by some defensive linemen after they got turned away and started a fight. We've also had athletes get turned away at the door and immediately call the cops on the party while they're still in the yard."

Frat,3ar46r,ipartytoomuch,4,Thu Jun 25 07:00:50 2015 UTC,"Audio is an interesting one, because a lot of consumer grade speakers will sound ""great"" to people because they don't really care about it or just don't really know what they haven't heard before... Or they'll listen to it when the rooms are empty and it'll be completely different when the rooms are packed with hundreds of people because bodies absorb sound. You should get some entry-level professional speakers that mobile DJs or such use.  So don't cheap out and buy some consumer speakers as they're not meant to play music for hundreds of people. If you get those borderline ones that may be able to pump out a lot of volume and bass for a short while they'll definitely blow soon because they're not meant to be pushed like that for so long. Max volume isn't continuous volume.  I think your budget is just good enough for getting some refurbished  pair of EV ELX115p that would serve 200+ people easily without problems. They'll suffice without a subwoofer for a ""15 speaker, but most likely you'll want a dedicated bass speaker eventually because that's probably the type of music you'll be playing a lot.  If you want a completely new setup, including a pair of speakers + subwoofer, go with a ""12 pair of speakers with a subwoofer like the Alto TS112A ($200 each, new on Amazon right now) and subwoofer like the Alto TSsub15 or ELX EV118p.  Subwoofers pretty much start at around $500 or more if you want something new and decent and can get much more expensive as well. Unfortunately its hard to get things lower than that unless you start looking into the used or refurbished route.  Also go with active speakers instead of passive ones if you don't want to mess with amps and want less equipment and wires because those speakers have a built in power supply."
Frat,3ar46r,Aetern1ty,4,Tue Jun 23 15:33:53 2015 UTC,Do you have multiple floors? Do you want different music on different floors? $800 is plenty to work with for a 2900 sqft house.

To him and his class, he went through everything with them and he was one of them; if his life experiences make him more immune to everything we do, great for him, but exemption wouldn't allow the same type of bonding."

Frat,3ajqj6,mdbrockman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:16:10 2015 UTC,It works pretty well as far as I can tell.  There definitely is a high shock value for freshmen when they hear the initial cost but we are very open about the dues structure over the course of their four years and what exactly they are paying for. I believe that this dues structure provides an incentive for older guys to stay active because they've already become invested in the fraternity and now they can enjoy it at a fraction of the former cost. We definitely lose some young guys to the cost but in our current state we need to ensure an initial financial deposit from pledges so that we can finish paying off our new house asap. As far as people paying on time goes out current and previous treasurers have been very proactive in helping people establish payment plans that allow them stay active while also not bankrupting themselves.

Frat,3aigpy,pwaves13,29,Sat Jun 20 14:31:43 2015 UTC,Having a formal rule for legacies can potentially force you into bidding a guy that wouldn't be a good fit for your chapter. You don't want to be in a situation where you all think a guy sucks but have to bid him because he's a legacy. Keep it informal and cut legacies some slack if they can be brought up to speed with the rest of the incoming pledge class.
Frat,3aigpy,DrJay1855,13,Sat Jun 20 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that if a legacy seems a little out of whack or a potential hazard if he becomes a brother, talk to the father. Nothing a proper pledge process cannot fix and the good thing is the father will probably be well aware of that and support his son if he went through the same thing."
Frat,3aigpy,quicks6x,11,Sat Jun 20 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"You don't need a rule. In my opinion, legacies should at least be given a chance.

Frat,3aigpy,Chr15py0696,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"We don't bid solely on someone being a legacy, it just kind of counts as a factor in their favor. We've had some guys come through who were just not people we wanted to associate with. Bad sportsmanship, rude, socially challenged, and not good students. One such guy was the son ofan alum who is very involved at the national level. He hasn't spoken to us since we refused his son a bid and were pretty sure he tells other alums/HQ that were on the ""wrong path"" because of it. It sucks  because he used to be one of our best old alumni. I'm still confident we made the right decision not bidding him.   I guess what I'm getting at is that legacy status doesn't really matter as much as if he fits your chapter culture. The only rule that we have with legacies is that we will make sure that we at least rush them so they have a fair shot. If they're a good PNM you can use it as a selling tool too."

I played one and actively went to the rest of the sports to support and watch. As long as you involve yourself in other activities/positions it should not be a big deal.

Once I started to recognize good academic habits I let everyone know that Brother A is doing well, a few brothers criticized the fact that this is almost like a golden star system but it fucking worked.  Another tip would be to start at the leaders in the chapter, find the leaders that the brothers look up too and make sure their grades are high. That way brothers will see their habits and (hopefully) adopt their methods  When I did this our chapter GPA increased by .26"

Frat,3a5pkd,R3xz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"When fraternities work together, there's usually a common interest amongst the group as a whole. That common interest involve elements that every fraternities value; it could be academic, social, being an upstanding member of the community, etc. When someone is trouble for a certain fraternity, they could be troublesome for any of the other fraternities. It's not always the case, but it's just good information for the other fraternities to know in the event that problem arise again from the same pledge if he rushed another fraternity.  If pledge was dropped because he got a DUI or a drug related charge, or is constantly failing his classes, wouldn't you want to know about it if he decided to rush your house?"

Frat,3a29ju,SamsDesigns,17,Tue Jun 16 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"Well this is about an IFC rule, so its imposed by the fraternities on themselves.

The rationale was that high rates of hospital visits, reported assaults, and arrests were bringing the community under scrutiny and was putting pressure on us to manage things with the understanding being, fix it yourselves or we'll fix it for you.   Anyways, we looked at the main common denominator in all the incidents: hard alcohol.   The way we saw it was if we could come to an agreement that we would just serve beer or other light drinks at parties the less negative incidents would occur, and we would get the university/press/etc. out of our business.  We tried it for about a weekend before the sorority girls flipped out that we wouldn't give them free booze and then it was back to the old ways.

Get ready to try to give the kids a good explanation of your time founding the organization. Also make sure to know how to deal with the little shits who will belittle your experience because of whatever reason.   I have to admit that there's some shit I wish I would've experienced (such as the whole fun pledging activities shabbang + close relationships with my pledge brothers).

I can't say that I'm super close to all my ""pledge brothers"" (as a matter of fact I'm a lot closer to some of the younger guys) but I learned a shit ton about the effort it takes to create an organization and its functional structure.

What you need to hold you guys together are some bylaws (not sure what you have yet) and rules in place to hold each other accountable. Reach out to other chapters and maybe alumni if you can. Work with IFC for pointers. How is your exec board? Do they have their shit together?   How are the chair positions such as community service, philanthropy and recruitment? Are they active? Do they hold the rest of the colony accountable? How often do you guys hold brotherhood events?   How long have you guys been a colony so far?   Try to answer some of these questions and we'll go from there."

We're still working very hard to pull everything together, hopefully we can charter within the 2015-16 academic year, but only time will tell. Right now it feels very iffy for me for a lot of reasons.  Somewhat small campus, less than 10000 students.  No pledging, and we have nobody to ask what to do with recruitment and initiating new brothers.  Even simple things that nationals seem to assume you know, like your own by-laws that we have to construct, we're basically just getting a ""Make your by-laws!"" by nationals, and nothing more.   .  It's gonna be an uphill battle, but I did this because I'm ready for that. I want to ba able to look back on this chapter in 10 years and say ""I made that"".

Frat,39v7f2,fosh1zzle,9,Mon Jun 15 04:33:21 2015 UTC,"And that's why you have a futon.   We had one guy who lofted his bed 6ft. Then built stairs going up the side. He made it large enough for a queen mattress. It was pretty great. And since it was so tall, he had tons of space left underneath for everything, including desk, couch, TV, etc. He ran rope light underneath for plenty of lighting."

They still make them, but the commercially made versions are expensive.  If you're handy with tools and can read construction plans, you can make the same thing for 10% of retail.  Most versions of the Murphy Bed can be stowed and deployed while fully made.  The Murphy Desk is the same concept, deployed at a different height off the floor to allow a large project desk to fit in a small space.  The horizontally attached single berths (attached and hinged along long axis) are usually called Pullman Berths, and were originally popular on trains, crew quarters for yachts, and smaller cabins on cruise ships."

It is apparent these guys do not want want to invest in your fraternity; they just want a new house to hang out together with their old brothers.   With this attitude, the new brothers from the other fraternity will NEVER bond or mix well with your colony.  Particularly as a colony, you HAVE to prioritize quality of recruitment over numbers of recruitment - despite how attractive numbers may seem to a small and new house that wants to grow quickly.    And those objections come to mind even before you know why their alumni board shut them down.  You need to know exactly what the alumni found before you even consider letting these guys rush and participate in a full pledge process.  Their actions have already brought down one house - does your colony want to be the second house they bring down?"
Frat,39vjmw,RobinIsAGoodfellow,6,Mon Jun 15 04:04:57 2015 UTC,That's how it seemed to me... they just want to have a name to associate with or something.

Secondly if they're not even willing to jump through the hoops to join you why the fuck would you want them? They'd probably just circle jerk and put rift in one of your first pledge classes.   Off topic: we've had two colonies start at my school and they both got massive numbers (granted the left over type kids like most starting colonies) but is it common for some of yall to get small colonies?"
Frat,39vjmw,aha602,2,Mon Jun 15 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've realized that they're the ones who need us more than the other way around... As it stands any other fraternity on campus that they'd want to join would make them go through a full process so I see no reason as to why we can't do that.  To answer your other query, I'm in a school up north, so whenever a colony starts here it begins small. I've never seen a huge colony start up here.

Again, probably not a stellar idea.   I do know that our rush chair hates it when he's recruiting kids for weeks and the kid doesn't join  So if you aren't interested you should just stop acting interested and we'll get the hint.

Frat,39r5kf,gettingshithandled,7,Sat Jun 13 23:13:20 2015 UTC,"We're a small chapter, right around the same number of guys. Our officers have to run things by everyone, and put it to a vote. Why? Because it becomes the rest of the chapter's responsibility to help an officer. For example, risk management sets the cut off time for parties. Rather then him picking it arbitrarily and hearing: ""We're not shutting the party down, we didn't agree on that time"" He puts it to a vote, and the responsibility of shutting down the party at the voted upon time is on everyone, because they voted on it.  Chairs and officers are also expected to report everything they plan on doing. We vote on dates so nothing conflicts. If he is given the autonomy to pick a date and time as he wishes, it could hurt things. The purpose of voting isn't stating that a brother is incapable of doing his job, it's stating that he is accountable to his brothers."
Frat,39r5kf,Justworkhere,9,Sun Jun 14 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"they have to battle to get funds   This is because you only have 20 actives. Don't get me wrong, having a strong brotherhood is important, but with that few people you will never have the funds to be socially relevant on any campus. I recommend throwing a significant portion of your budget toward rush, while still emphasizing a strong brotherhood and core values. My chapter has grown from 30 actives to 65 in the past year thanks to two amazing rush seasons, and our parties have gotten insanely better as a result. People actually know us now, they like us, and it's only getting better. And I'm still close with all of my brothers. I know nearly all of them personally and the ones I don't I make an effort to spend time with.   As for autonomy of officers, we pretty much have full control over our positions, so long as we stay within our budgets and follow our chapter bylaws and IFC regulations. All of the officers work together with each other and other members of the chapter through committees in order to ensure that everyone's on the right track and to make sure everything gets done. For example, as the rush chair I have a committee of about 10 people (including the treasurer and president) that help me organize rush: calendar, shirts, business cards, and events when the time comes are all handled by the committee. But when it comes down to it, I have the final call on matters related to rush, and if I need something done I have the power to delegate tasks to certain people within the committee. It really is a team effort, but it's so fucking worth it to have a kickass rush and get a great pledge class. Good luck man, lemme know if you need anything else."
Frat,39r5kf,goodberger14,2,Sun Jun 14 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"Everything major needs to be run past exec committee at an exec meeting. Chapter also has the authority to override if they feel they need to.   Most of the time, they can act fairly autonomously. Once major details are set for an event, socials have a lot of freedom to shape it. Things like that.   Any major things that execs want to do have to be approved by the higher-ups. The most autonomy obviously sits with the President and Vice-President. Next amount of autonomy goes to Treasurer, Pledge Educator, and Recruitment. Those three report directly to President who can essentially override anything, unless he becomes tyrannical or something."
Frat,39r5kf,blueandgold92,2,Sun Jun 14 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input guys. Its frustrating because some things are time sensitive, require chapter approval, and will directly impact our recruitment opportunities for the fall.  If we dont have the info turned in and approved, we cant start recruitment on time and we get a sub par pledge class. I guess like justworkhere said, its the rest of the chapters responsibility to assist.   I'm the president of my chapter and we're approaching our first semester on campus (rambling now, but whatevs). Since our school finally decided to stop calling us a ""gang"" and treat us as like any other national fraternity, its a big deal for us. Alumni from our chapter all over me about maintaing our identity and not growing beyond 25+ guys, and our nationals are putting the fate of the entire fraternity on us since the other chapters we have active are still learning and my chapter is expected to assist with reactivating dormant chapters at schools and helping with forming new colonies at other schools.   So I'm trying to get all of the stuff our chapter needs to do organized now in the summer with the exec board while we have time so we can hit the ground running, and also set the framework for future brothers so they can enjoy benefits that I'll never have. I care about my guys and my chapter. I just wanna do the best I can to ensure that the chapter will function well and  all they have to worry about in the future is what theme they want for their mixers, who to give a bid to and where they'll be helping out in the community."
Frat,39r5kf,TDenverFan,2,Sun Jun 14 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"How big are most frats on your campus?  My chapter isn't massive, but we still use committees for stuff, and the committees work with our treasurer at the start of the year to set a budget, and if something big comes up they can try to see if we can get them more funds. /the use of those funds is determined by the committee members, and they give the rest of the chapter updates."
Frat,39r5kf,john_the_fisherman,2,Sun Jun 14 02:51:51 2015 UTC,"Do you have an executive board? Our officers mainly have autonomy and bigger decisions like if they want to change something that was done in the past it goes through an executive vote. If it passes that then it goes to the chapter. The chapter can come to exec whenever they want to put their input on bit generally, especially since your such a small chapter anyway, it'll be easy for the officers to see what is popular and what isnt.  Do you have a treasurer? Have the treasurer create a budget for the year, as in how much money goes to what posistion and that officer can use it as he pleases. For anything requiring $50+, require that the officer talk to the treasurer first."

What they do with the money is pretty much up to their discretion so long as what they do is fine with risk management.  Then they present what they are doing to the chapter and depending on the reception they either change it or not.  Usually there's a positive reaction cuz they all know what the chapter wants"

Our Arch Chapter is made up of nitwits from bullshit colleges (unfortunately I don't want to divulge personal examples of how objectively unintelligent they are). They also bleed us dry on convention fees, while they enjoy the conventions in limousines with all of their meals paid.   And God forbid you get into any trouble with your school. Universities may have ""conduct"" processes massively slanted against fraternities, but at least they have something. Delt just hands out punishments on a whim.

Our nationals is also small so you really can be heard. They're more of a hands off approach with the old and established chapters and more of a ""typical"" nationals for new colonies and chapters.  Most importantly though, they do what nationals is supposed to do, stick up for their own. They led the fight for legislation protecting free speech and free association at private colleges. They sued Amherst when it banned fraternities, sued Middlebury when it forced fraternities coed, sued Colgate when they mandated sale of chapter houses to the school, and are now suing Wesleyan which is trying to force fraternities into extinction. They refused to revoke U Washington's charter even after it had it's recognition taken away by the school (3 years after a hazing incident). Finally, it refused to suspend our mother chapter's charter when the school caved and derecognized the chapter there after national pressure.   Sorry, I know this is the exact opposite of this thread's purpose but I'm really so proud of DKE for doing what's right instead of caving to media and public pressure. Not to say they condone extreme hazing or other violations, but they view these issues rationally."

For instance, going sockless is obviously fine when you're going to brunch, but not when you're going to work in banking. However, here are a few things that I strongly disagreed with:   Stick with loafers; they’re more comfortable and convenient.  And the conventional wisdom that they lack the formality of traditional lace-ups has long-since expired.   You absolutely should not wear loafers as a first-year investment banking analyst for the same reason you shouldn't wear a Patek or Ferragamo shoes as a first-year investment banking analyst — you'll come off as a complete chach to your superiors.   Prada and Gucci; start and end there.  Decent $700 shoes will last you 3-4x times longer than something you pick up from Bloomingdale’s for $300. Do the math.   While this is true, you're going to look like a chach.   The infamous blue shirt and white collar is acceptable, as long as the shade of blue isn’t too deep and accompanied with a power tie.   No, it's not.  Again, this is tactical advice for someone who just graduated college and doesn't want to get himself or herself made fun of by everyone in the office.

I am suddenly moving to a part of the country where spanish is spoken more than english, and am going to start taking Arabic classes next Fall.  I guess I have my work cut out for me haha.  Grammar books are also really good for this kind of time.  Like, if you get one on your level, it is essentially like doing sudoku or whatever, but at the end of it you are fluent in a language.  http://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/hebrew.html  If you need free study loot, this is a really great introductory course that used to be used for foreign service officers and military from the 1960s, and is now available free and legally.  It sucks to have a commute like that, but even sort of just browsing a textbook and listening to a tape semi-passively will get you a long way in that time frame.  Much more useful than playing music.  I know you likely know this, but like every big library either has any language stuff you like (even the expensive tapes) or can request it via interlibrary loan and you can do it for free."

So this was moreso reddit just protecting it's own ass. As far as them having a reason to ban r/frat, it couldn't be because we're in frat's, that would be targeting a group of people for their personal thoughts and beliefs, like how they didn't ban r/coontown, no matter how different the beliefs are there.  The only way I could see /r/frat coming close to getting banned would be if we did more of the witch hunt kind of shit like, similar to what we did with the Udub ""check your privilege party"" facebook event, and started harassing people like the creator of this event. But being that we normally don't really go after people as a group (let alone have enough people to do anything truely detrimental if we tried), we're going to be fine.  The only way we could get banned is if we picked a specific person to go after as a group, then got our own personal fraternities in on it too, because that has a real potential to really fuck someone up.  TL;DR: good point, we aren't there yet, we have potential to be that terrible of a group though"

While it's always good to try to better ourselves, this whole ""Fattening"" hoo-ha will probably blow over in a week.  I know some people like to poke some fun at geeds in other subreddits, but as long as we aren't complete fucking blockheads and post things like:   lol r/frat is leaking   We should be fine.  FPH was probably targeted since it had a shit load of subscribers, and reddit's own standards chair probably just picked a few other subreddits to ban to make it seems like she didn't just want to ban one."

Its the fucking internet, there's going to be jackasses who make assumptions and don't see eye to eye with you, you should be strong enough to not call for site wide censorship of differing opinions (even if they're inflammatory and wrong) just because someone on the internet dislikes you."
Frat,39drk0,messenak,2,Thu Jun 11 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think /r/fatpeoplehate is a bit different from other subreddits that also criticize and mock others. Subreddits like /r/iamverysmart and /r/justneckbeardthings don't actually do personal attacks at people for what their appearance is like, however, /r/fatpeoplehate specifically targets against those who are overweight and/or obese.   For example, people on /r/iamverysmart may attack a person for being arrogant, stupid, or flat out ridiculous, but notice how they never do personal attacks against a specific person (or group of people in general). This subreddit may be similar in the ways it pokes fun at others, but it's mocking character rather than appearance (which doesn't make them bad people). They also block out all the personal information on the person who made the obnoxious remark, unlike /r/fatpeoplehate, where they would commonly just post a photo of a ""body positive"" fat person and say something horrific about them.   Isn't it free speech? Yes, but companies have the right to limit the speech of their employees if they are misrepresenting the company or ruining the company's identity with their free speech. I don't see why a company should have to keep one of their workers if they post something extremely racist, prejudiced, bigoted, hateful, or anything that would hinder the image of the company. Applying this to Reddit, I don't see why removing controversial and hateful subreddits is conflicting. If I owned my own website, I wouldn't want people shaming or harassing people.   The difference between /r/fatpeoplehate and any other subreddits is the way the subreddit intentionally (and by its very own nature) shames, humiliates, and destroys the character of innocent lives, who are struggling with something very, very personal. This goes beyond free speech, and I believe a great chunk of /r/fatpeoplehate material is hate speech"

After many doxxing scandals and the negative press that comes with it our CEO is looking at the situation with this in mind:  *These people are irrational, they've proved that just by their subreddits nature  *If they have no fear snagging photos of the imgur staff, what else could they snag?  Under these conditions FPH is a liability that can ruin a lot of growth"
Frat,39drk0,didled,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"Just a small correction. They didn't dox the imgur staff at all. They accused them of blacklisting the sub from making the front page of imgur (which was true), and then straight deleting photos hosted on imgur that were popular FPH posts (also true).  The imgur CEO, who is actually kind of cool, went to FPH to try and explain, they banned his account from the subreddit, and then posted the photo calling them all fat on the sidebar. That's all that really happened. They don't brigade anymore than SRS or other subreddits do. They were extremely hateful, but it was a really well moderated subreddit, and they kept their business pretty clean."
Frat,39drk0,dddane,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:49:47 2015 UTC,"Classic Feds vs States argument right here, but with a bit of a twist. Try and view imgur as being something similar to the EU, like maybe a NAU (North American Union).   The NAU and a state (/r/fatepeoplehate) have a disagreement, the NAU takes quick action, followed with their president/state adviser attempting to enter the state to explain, but is banned from entering the state, and is publicly shamed. Being that the US (reddit) needs to have a good relationship with the NAU in order to keep up those sick trade agreements they've been getting, this look really bad on the part of the US. After some rumors of attacks on the NAU from this state come to the public, as well as rumors of harassment and assault on some of NAU's allies and friends come to be, the US does an investigation of their own.  They determine the state to not be in proper condition, with no chance to ever be in proper condition ever again, and disband it into other states.  Whether the state deserved to be disbanded or not will only be speculation at this point, as the ruling has been made, and being that is was one of the larger states, other state start to speculate and wonder if the state deserved it, and if it didn't will their state be next?  After writing this, I realized you could also see this from the view of  NIC being the NAU, you're specific Nationals being the US, and your chapter being your state."

I.e. A group of thetas want to come hang out at your tailgate, but their scheduled tailgate already happened the first game of the season, they're now SOL till next year. Do it on the major games: homecoming, rivalry week, the first game of the season, etc. but leave your tailgates ""open"" for the most part.   Food is also a big plus, get 2-3 grills going and get volunteers (or pledges) to man the grills the whole time. A tent or 3 for shade also helps on those hot days, and a speaker system is essential. Obviously this takes a lot of work for setting up/tearing down, so again, ask for volunteers (or pledges) to do it and create a system so there is a rotation and the same group of guys doesn't get shafted every weekend doing all the work.   Try and get multiple parking spots/or rent a bigger area to tailgate in. If you can't do that, maybe look into the possibility of doing it at a house that is a comfortable walking distance to the stadium, that is, if people even care about going to the games.   Corn hole, BP tables, flip cup, and other games you can play are a must, as well as chairs for people to sit in; either collapsible camping chairs, lawn chairs, or just standard folding ones."

Frat,39cl6x,CigBreak,2,Tue Jun 16 00:23:40 2015 UTC,Let's just say I bought a BB polo and a skipjack of similar colors at the same time and after 3 or 4 months the skipjack looked like shit and the BB looked brand new. I also had a button up from them and the stitching was coming out all over the place after two wash cycles.

Frat,398h74,fresh_kicks,10,Wed Jun 10 00:39:43 2015 UTC,"We debated this a few years ago when we had a pledge drop because of some shitty family circumstances that really put him in a tough financial spot. He was doing really well in pledgeship and he's a bright kid. It made us question whether our chapter or local association should have some sort of fund to dip into when we have people who are committed but genuinely cannot pay. We haven't implemented anything yet, but it's still a discussion and it might be something I try to assist with as an alumni.   Right now, our chapter just practices leniency for those who really need it. If you simply claim you have financial issues, but then you're purchasing a ton of alcohol every week and going out -- we ignore the appeal. If you claim financial troubles after you're overdue and we're already trying to collect -- we ignore the appeal. If someone sits down with the Treasurer and/or President and has an open and honest conversation, sometimes bill due dates have a magical way of extending themselves a long period of time. The chapter usually has a bit of extra cash, so it's not a big deal. We base a lot of this on open communication and their commitment to other aspects of the fraternity.   In terms of new members, we could go with the same policy. But we typically try to be very open and blunt about financial obligations right from day zero -- so we don't necessarily always attract those who are unable to pay, or they're prepared to work."
Frat,398h74,blueandgold92,10,Wed Jun 10 03:26:06 2015 UTC,We've done things like that for a couple guys before. As long as they could pay half we would do a fundraiser for the rest.

Frat,398h74,JohnOBrosley,5,Wed Jun 10 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"Or dues are low enough that it'd be unlikely (<400 a semester), and would only be given in extraordinary circumstances. We'll give you an extended payment plan type of thing, and give you ample time to pay, but they're low enough you could cover it with an on campus job, which are super easy to get."
Frat,398h74,TDenverFan,3,Wed Jun 10 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"What is important is that you are committed to your fraternity and to your brothers. One way you are expected to show that commitment is dues, but if you can't pay your dues in full that isn't a reflection on your commitment, so it really shouldn't matter. If the fraternity can find a way to come up with the rest of the funds then ability to pay shouldn't be an issue."

With that being said, however, I never understood why people use the word forced in these kinds of situations. No pledge is ever forced to do anything; they can walk away from the process at any time.  That's just something small that's always nagged me about these kinds of situations."
Frat,393c0y,Ras_TafarhIgh,19,Tue Jun 9 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"In many ways I could see how it feels forced to a lot of freshmen. When I pledged, I had few friends outside of my pledge class, I had already dropped a good amount of money on the fraternity. Add that to the actives telling all of us how no fraternity would give us a bid if we dropped and how the entire campus would know what a pussy we were if we dropped, I figured it would be worse than quitting school all together (in my stupid 18 year old mind). I understand that most times it's never actually ""forced"" but I think a lot of kids don't realize that it will be okay if they drop."
Frat,393c0y,MorticiansFlame,2,Tue Jun 9 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree slightly. If it was that easy (emotionally) to get out of it no one would do shit as a pledge. Yeah no pledge enjoys getting yelled at or having to do something like clean the house, but there are consequences of not doing what you're told.   That pledge process is harder (physically) than most other fraternities. If you had a super easy pledge process and out of nowhere they say ""Lick this piece of shit"", you would definitely speak up and say hell no. However, if the entire process consisted of stuff like that, it might be harder to say no."
Frat,393c0y,Your_EskimoBro,2,Wed Jun 10 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you don't want to do the shit a chapter does for it's pledging rituals, drop and find somewhere else that fits your own morals and values. It's a matter of common sense and personal responsibility. But also, fuck those guys for making them drink piss. I would have upper decked every actives toilet that fucked with me and dipped."

Frat,393c0y,MorticiansFlame,4,Tue Jun 9 03:25:57 2015 UTC,"As someone in a fraternity that doesn't do any kind of hazing, what do you all do if a pledge refuses to go through with something because they think it's stupid? I don't mean stuff like what KDR did here but some of the more common practices like bows and toes (especially on bottlecaps which apparently happens occasionally) or driving to the beach to get sand and then throwing it away. Say they're a great pledge otherwise and learn about the fraternity and act as a leader in their pledge class, takes a lot of initiative, but thinks mundane tasks like that are for some active's amusement and refuses to do them. Would you really drop a pledge because they don't see the point to things like that?"

One of the reasons people join fraternities is to make connections.  You don't have to shell out job offers, but talking about the following to the actives would probably help them out a ton.   What do you do as a career, how is it different than school, and how did school prepare you? How did you get your job? Was it through scores of online apps, an inside connection, internship/co-op, through the career center, etc? What are the hiring people looking for in resumes, cover letters, and applications? How does someone get their first job fresh out of college?   You could really help some people in your chapter by providing them the means for them to help themselves. Some poor bastard might have no idea what his line of work entails until he graduates, then he might have wished to switch majors.  Fraternity men are supposed to be aspiring professionals, and helping them out in this regard furthers that tenet."
Frat,39238a,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Tue Jun 9 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"If you have particularly close and loyal contacts in the college Deans' offices that supervise fraternity life, or if you have particularly close and loyal contacts at Nationals, reinvest in those contacts and use them to protect your Brothers and your Chapter.  That's likely the most valuable role an alum can play.    Try to signal to the Actives that you are ALWAYS available for advice, even in a crisis, even at 03:00 - you may get a call that can avoid a disaster.    If you have a profession or skill that could be of vital use to the chapter (attorney, emergency physician, accountant, etc) then offer your help.    Eventually, as your own career builds, perhaps you will want to set some targeted goals for financially supporting the Chapter - maybe 5% of net, or maybe targeting a specific House need every five years like an outdoor kitchen, or refurbishing the grounds, or a basketball court, or a beach volleyball court, or a pool - some midsized project that you think needs addressing that is within your means to support.  Above all else, work tirelessly to protect the traditions that made your chapter important to you.  If Pledging made you a better man, then make sure Pledging stays a part of the Chapter.  If having a large House to live in together and to party together made college more memorable to you, then make sure the Chapter keeps a large House - either on campus or off-campus.  If particular Brotherhood events were epic, lobby for their continuation.    Stay the positive, available, wise, younger alum but remember that the Chapter now belongs to its Actives.  Revel in the time you still get to spend with your Brothers, and nourish a deep pride in what you and your Brothers have built."

A gold plated key is included with the initiation fee.  If the member wants a 10 or 14k gold key they have to pay extra.  Since this member opted to pay the extra cost for the 14K key I would think it was somewhat important to him (at least at the time, which would have been in the 1960's)."

Frat,38xq0v,MattoGman,18,Sun Jun 7 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have the financial resources to build a new house, but that you are prevented from doing so by local zoning and by the betrayal of your college, by the loss of your primary alumni protector, and by the ambivalence of the remaining alumni.  I think you need to have a short conversation with a local attorney who specializes in local zoning to see if that zoning hurdle is surmountable.  Developers face this roadblock all the time, and they usually work it out with the threat of a lawsuit.  If that fails, then you need to have a second brief conversation with a much higher powered attorney about whether you have a case against the university - and if so whether that can be used as leverage to QUICKLY restart real progress on building your promised house on fraternity row or getting back your original house.   These initial conversations won't be very expensive - maybe $500 each - just to see if there is a case and a possibility of making progress.  Your E-Board should do this themselves - without involving your alumni or the chapter or the university.  They should make no commitments, just present the facts, explain the problem, and ask if help is available.  If these conversations show a path forward, then the chapter and the alumni can be briefed - and the chapter can make a decision on how to proceed.  But if you depend on your current alumni, it sounds like you are unlikely to make quick progress."

Frat,38wzud,PU18,8,Mon Jun 8 00:28:01 2015 UTC,I'll suggest that you makeup a mock floor plan and work from there. Get the measurements for the rooms you'll be furnishing and then use something like Ikea Home Planner so you can figure out what furniture you'll need and in what sizes to make it the house you want it to be.
Frat,38wzud,Impune,6,Sun Jun 7 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"Because of the number of Brothers housed there and frequently spending time there, the common rooms for fraternity houses are oversized, even compared to mansions of similar size and price.  And so most furnishings, particularly couches, ottomans, club chairs, side tables, coffee tables - they must also be oversized to avoid looking disproportionately small when installed.  These common area furnishings also need to be oversized because they will be commonly seating more people at one time than in a similarly sized mansion hosting a reception.  Pulling sofas, loveseats,  and chairs away from walls and making several different conversation areas in a big room allows others to walk around the outside of these conversation groups.  If there is any possible way, plan for double beds in the rooms, rather than Twins or Twin XLs.  Sleeping with someone is much more comfortable in a double (or full) and the double / full mattress is only 15 inches wider than the Twin sized mattress.  Buy good quality, firm, pillow-top mattresses - some of the most fun and some of the most essential rest you need will be on that mattress.  Most desks designed for students have inexplicably ignored that more than books and paper has to fit on a desktop.  By the time you fit a laptop or desktop monitor and keyboard, plus a printer (if the printer can't fit elsewhere) and maybe small speakers, there is seldom room on a desk for book or paper.  Buy the biggest and best desks you can fit into the rooms - after all the primary reason you are in college is to study and learn.  Assure you plan for enough bandwidth for your house's wifi.  Make sure you have enough electrical service to the house for the kitchen, laundry, and everyone's devices.    Assure your hot water heaters or instant hot water systems can furnish enough hot water for everyone to shower at about the same time.  Make sure the water line supplying the house is large enough to allow morning showers at about the same time.  For every ten guys in the house, you may need one washer and one drier in your laundry room.  No glass tables.  Install smoke detectors that cannot be bypassed, in addition to regular battery powered smoke detectors.  The UNC Phi Gam fire on graduation eve killed five brothers because smoke detectors had been disabled to allow smoking.  Make sure flooring is no-slip - textured tile or wood with textured finish.  Carpet won't last.    Make sure all windows can be shaded or curtained - the Dean is always watching.  Leather furniture is much easier to clean than upholstered furniture.  It's almost impossible to steam clean vomit or urine or feces from upholstery because the fluids seep below the fabric and into the stuffing and padding.  In the long run, leather is cheaper because it can last longer than one year.  If you have a big media room, try to construct tiered seating like in a movie theater, and install long couches rather than individual seats.  We actually used the blueprints for our house and marked out every room in full sized dimensions in a field, then we marked out the size and position of prospective furniture - with the furniture's accurate dimensions.  It took an entire weekend to do, but we avoided some big mistakes that would have only become apparent when the furniture was bought and installed.  Make sure doorways are wide enough (and tall enough) to easily move furniture in - oversized couches require oversized doors."

It was a great start but the stuff for rooms was really unnecessary as a lot of bros had that stuff anyways. Over the years we ended up buying ping pong tables, pool table, and couches but what really made our new house feel like home was painting murals in common areas, putting up letters in various parts of the house, hanging up composites ect.

Most rooms also happen to have at least on closet. Tables (foldable) and chairs for eating/meetings is important. Couches and tables in the common room also help bring people together to hangout. Apart from that we let brothers do what they want with their rooms (within reason) many have bought more chairs, couches, and whatever else they might want. I recommend buying for your maximum occupancy now if you have a place to store what you don't need, it will help alleviate some of the growing pains as more brothers move in in the coming years. Kitchen will need some pantries to store food. A number of bins for recycling makes cleaning up a lot easier and saves you money. pong tables are nice but its also possible to build them yourself."

The haze machine enhances all light sources, especially lasers which will emit solid beams of light from the source outward.   DO NOT GET A FOG MACHINE, they are way more of a liability since they obstruct the view of the facility, and most fire marshals tends to condemn them.  Another cool thing to get, in line with the slushy/margarita machines, is a fountain drink/soda dispenser. This will eliminate having to worry about getting mixers when you go to the candy store."
Frat,38r0j7,R3xz,3,Sat Jun 6 02:39:41 2015 UTC,Are fog machines fire hazards in small homes that it's hard to fit a lot of people in the basement?   Edit: I do realize that in itself is a fire hazard
Frat,38r0j7,fresh_kicks,7,Sat Jun 6 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"Fog machines are usually meant for large venues with a lot of open ceiling space. The fog will dissipate and create a hazy ambient.   In a closed environment, the fog is not only a fire hazard because it limit visibility of the venue, but it's also a health hazard when the fog is dense enough to cause trouble breathing.   If you do decide to get a fog machine, get an ice fog machine that create a fog that exclusively hugs the ground instead of rising up."
Frat,38r0j7,R3xz,3,Sat Jun 6 18:58:50 2015 UTC,This will eliminate having to worry to go get mixers   Instead you have the problem of ordering new fountain syrups whenever the old one is low. They're not cheap either (roughly the same price as an equivalent amount of bottled soda). And you need a plumber to install it. And they require routine maintenance. This is a no-go.
Frat,38r0j7,corporat,3,Sat Jun 6 16:43:07 2015 UTC,"It's not about the cost, it's more for the convenience of always having something reliable that consistently deliver soda to your cup.  secondly, you don't have live-in members and pledges routinely clean things in the house?

It's obviously not a great idea if you're still struggling to pay the bill. The weekly/monthly maintenance is not a big deal for any house that does weekly cleanup of its facility like I said earlier. It's quicker and easier to clean that than having to be put in the dish pit for our weekly house clean.

At my brother in laws bachelor party one of his groomsman broke his hand riding one. Cost.  I don't know how large your rush budget is, but the mechanical bull was a biggest expense we had. Cost like $2,000 dollars or something. At my school that is usually a chapters entire budget for rush.

The money you save can go towards things like a wet bar, pong/fooseball/arcade machine/golf simulator/projector or whatever your guys are into. Try getting some new wall decorations. Thrift stores and yard sales are great and cheap. Even reorganizing existing items can be refreshing. Maybe get a trophy case. If you have digital photos of guys in the house at various functions, try printing and framing some for the walls. Having something other than composites makes it feel more like home. Do you have a shot ski? Hang one up if you don't.  Try creating a BBQ pit. Cinder blocks and thick chicken wire, some scrap metal. Cut a metal trash can in half and weld it together for a solid top. This requires some tools and handywork. Don't operate a welder or plasma cutter if you don't know what you're doing.  Do you have a big yard? Make a slip/soap n slide.

If you are German then maybe depending on your bloodline.  German fraternities are very different then americans and were not founded out of the literary societies of discussion. Rather these soceities were founded out of Mensieur fencing which still exists. The point of this fencing was for noblemen to get long scars on their faces."

Look at any of the organizations that have openly published their rituals, or whose have been leaked (and trust me, most have). They aren't any better off than Fiji is.

At best a bunch of people who don't know your organization's history and symbols can look through the rituals and go ""Eh, seems boring, but at least they aren't literally the Illuminati"". At worst it undermines the symbolism of the pledge process because a pledge can just read the open initiation ritual and know all the symbolic meaning without studying the history behind it."

And moreover, at least in my fraternity, one of the most powerful things about the bond of brotherhood is that no one else in the world knows our secrets.

But as for the secret mottos and stuff I would say the majority of my chapter doesn't know it because its usually in an extinct language like greek, latin, arahmic etc. Ritual is cool to go through and see the first time, but after seeing every class go through it, it loses appeal at least for me. What makes the fraternity most cherished is the experience you had in college wiht it. If you ended up in a bad chapter or a chapter you don't like, its going to be pointless for you. And I am going to get shit from this, but each message is usually around the idea of being the best brother you can be through etc."

I agree that the shared experiences we all have in college are important, but if you honestly got nothing out of our initiation process, your chapter needs to seriously reevaluate how you execute that process. Every fraternity does things differently, thats what makes them unique, and while we share similar values with other frats, the culture of your frat and its level of adherence to your own values are what really define your fraternity. I think to commit to a group of other men as a brother, with the intention of upholding shared values and secrets, and then passing those shared values and secrets off because they aren't as important as the ""frat life"", is disrespectful to a shared tradition that is vastly larger than your particular chapter."

Frat,38f6h4,questionsoninsurance,4,Wed Jun 3 20:28:31 2015 UTC,Why would parents be liable? In most cases the members are over 18.
Frat,38f6h4,Gingrich2016,3,Wed Jun 3 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Because even post-18-year-olds are covered under their parents' homeowners' and (often) auto policies.  From the Atlantic article:  ""Gentle reader, if you happen to have a son currently in a college fraternity, I would ask that you take several carbon dioxide–rich deep breaths from a paper bag before reading the next paragraph. I’ll assume you are sitting down. Ready?  “I’ve recovered millions and millions of dollars from homeowners’ policies,” a top fraternal plaintiff’s attorney told me. For that is how many of the claims against boys who violate the strict policies are paid: from their parents’ homeowners’ insurance. As for the exorbitant cost of providing the young man with a legal defense for the civil case (in which, of course, there are no public defenders), that is money he and his parents are going to have to scramble to come up with, perhaps transforming the family home into an ATM to do it. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old “man” but on his planning-for-retirement parents.""  From the Yale Daily News article linked:  Brothers are being sued because they pooled money for a fraternity-organized event at a football tailgate that resulted in death and injuries.  RobinIsAGoodfellow has the details correct about Nationals refusing to cover fraternity actions they deem to be in violation of risk management policies.  That said, RobinIsAGoodfellow gets it wrong by saying liability to parents ends when the son is 18 years old."
Frat,38f6h4,RTB-45,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"Very true.  The parents are still tied to their 18+ college student through the parents' homeowners policy.  But that too, is easy to correct.  If parents take their son off their homeowners' policy, make him get his own separate car insurance policy, and execute a few other documents to separate themselves and their assets from their now adult son, the parents can be easily protected.  That really needs to be part of how families prepare to send their children off to college - not just for families who send their son to join a fraternity."
Frat,38f6h4,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:03:21 2015 UTC,Are there even fraternities that allow members under the age of 18?
Frat,38f6h4,dddane,5,Wed Jun 3 21:31:06 2015 UTC,The only exception I know of is kids with late birthdays who turn 18 during their first semester of college.
Frat,38f6h4,Gingrich2016,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"At many colleges, there is no minimum or maximum age for students - so the age for freshmen is basically determined by the age you started K-12 and whether you skipped grades.  Ignoring skipped grades, most public schools require children to be 5 years old by Oct 1 or Oct 15 in order to start kindergarden.  Passing that age through K-12, then statistically at least 1 out of 12 college freshmen would arrive on campus as 17 year olds.  A USA Today study found that freshmen represented over half of all undergraduate falls from windows, balconies, and rooftops; and worse that 47% of all undergraduate deaths were freshmen. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-24-campus-deaths-cover_x.htm?csp=14   The actions of a minor 17 year old, even at college, can be made the responsibility of the parents.  The same article cited by the OP in The Atlantic revealed that the Nationals sponsored insurance most fraternity men are required to pay for is specifically designed by Nationals to NOT cover you if something happens. So there have been many cases of hungry lawyers going after the home and assets of a freshman fraternity member's parents when bad things happen.  There are simple ways of preventing this nonsense, but some of those solutions are difficult to swallow.  First, fraternities should accept only pledges 18 and over.  That's the easiest to implement.  Men should join fraternities, not boys."

No freshman wants to rush a house that's likely to go on dry or social probation - or worse.  Pledgeship - most worthy guys actually WANT to have a pledgeship like their fathers and grandfathers - not sadistic torture, but a true crucible they can be proud of surmounting.  Large and loyal local alumni group who support the House and its activities, and who are the core of the aftercollege fraternity network.  Intramural powerhouse.  Cleancut image - good looking brothers who can clean up well for date nights and formals.  No drugs - most worthy guys who will succeed in college and after college really don't want to live with a cult of druggies who care more about getting wasted than getting a great education and doing something profound with their lives.  Active non-secret rituals - like serenading sororities.  Having a House Frat Hound - a lot of guys will miss their dog back home, and will like the idea of having a house dog.  Due diligence your rushees - talk to high school friends - you want to know as much as possible before extending bids.  Don't be shy about telling the best rushees that your house wants them.  This is like landing top talent for a business - you aggressively go after the best guys - you don't wait for them to come to you.   Hold informal rush events over the summer so rushees can meet your brothers and get a good impression before the semester starts.  Maybe a lake party with a big houseboat, grilling out, jetskis, ski boats, parasailing, maybe even an aquajet or hoverjet.  Maybe a grillout at the House.

If pot is done occasionally and quietly out of site and out of common areas of the house, I think it's likely fine.  My point was that no highly driven, bright guy is going to want to pledge a house that feels like a dope den.  If pot is something that some guys do occasionally and privately, that's not going to scare anybody away.   But I will also warn that any college dean with a vendetta against a fraternity house could easily get a sheriff to bring a drug sniffing dog to any house on campus property.

That way the next time you talk to them you're not starting from square one all over. You can look at your notes beforehand and when you talk to them, address them by name. Ask them how such and such is going, how they're enjoying that class they told you about, all that jazz. This also makes it easier to introduce them to guys that have the same interests, or are from the same area."

Frat,38b7kt,fratagonia420,4,Thu Jun 4 15:49:21 2015 UTC,"If your school does orientation for incoming freshman, have your brothers be orientation leaders. It sets a good first impression and a lot of the guys I knew when I was active joined because of orientation or Hokie Camp. At my school, a fair amount of orientation leaders were in a fraternity or sorority. I think campus involvement in general leads to good socializing and recruitment, especially when it isn't rush.  If there is a freshman move-in day/week, have your brothers volunteer to help freshman move in and wear something with letters on it. At my school, they give you blue shirts for all volunteers (so families can call you out easier for help) so our brothers wore hats with our letters on it."

Frat,38b7kt,Fratrick_Kane,2,Thu Jun 4 03:46:33 2015 UTC,Yea I see a lot of people talking about being orientation leaders. Being that first contact is invaluable when it comes to rush. You'll be one of the few people they know and will instinctively come to you for advice the first few weeks. Play it right and you can get them added on Facebook and start rushing them early on in the summer so you have some guys locked in prior to rush.

Today — although the official prohibition remains — 11 of the university’s 12 fraternity houses still host drinking parties, the dean’s report found.   Does this actually surprise anyone on this subreddit?

That too, is university affiliated housing.  Are entire dorms sanctioned when the RA finds a freshman drinking in his room?  As a State school, they cannot treat some students differently just because they are members of a particular organization - that would violate Freedom of Association and earn the school a great big nasty Civil Rights lawsuit and treble damages.  Sounds like it's time to ask the alumni to help pony up to move the chapters off campus and disaffiliate with the state university.

Frat,389k96,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Wed Jun 3 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"Well, if the University will not allow you to act as a fraternity ON campus, and if your Nationals will not allow you to disaffiliate with the University, then you have a stark choice.  The only way to preserve the core of your fraternity - well chosen guys, living together through college, adventuring together, and holding one another to an agreed high standard - is to cut ties with both the university and with Nationals.  The only way to keep your fraternity is to go underground as an off-campus secret society.  Nationals cannot prevent that; neither can the university.

Buy a kid like a 24 pack or something for being the best brother that week after an event or just a good bro. Open the floor for a couple minutes in chapter to allow brothers to shout out other brothers for living up to ur fraternity values. Also, make it mandatory for brothers to go to events on campus. Only allowed to miss 2 chapters a semester, and 2 events on campus whether its a sorority philanthropy event, IM games, passing out flyers, etc. If they don't meet quota, they get a fine. Easy as that. If they don't meet quota or try to make it up next semester, kick em out. No need for dead weight."

Forget the energy drink, I wouldn't drink something that's been sitting in a box for a couple of days in the mail. Maybe find one of those ""Southern South Frat Point Tide Proper"" companies that keep popping up and see if they would package shirts or tanks as advertisement. Any little knicknack to do with alcohol would probably be cool as long as it's not something that would break easily."

Ties, initially I think they would be our own because we can control margins far easier and maintain quality/price but the question has already been presented, would we include other companies as well? I think yes.   Cigars, I enjoy a good cigar 1-2x a month but certainly couldn't have an educated opinion on it at this very moment. I imagine with high volume we could do middle to middle-high sticks."

Maybe alternate bow and neck tie every month?   Just myself personally, a once of month box that contains the following: Neck/Bow tie, random cigar/cutter, koozie(s), alcohol related knickknack, and maybe a shirt or something similar every few months is definitely worth $25 a month."

Frat,389lho,DaIlluminaughty,4,Tue Jun 2 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"Without a place to party, you need events that do not have alcohol (in theory) but that people can pregame for, like barbecues and sporting events. Have some joint fraternity parties but save them for later in the year; potentials will likely associate their experiences with the hosting fraternity, not yours. Only go for the bar/club events if they go easy on fakes."
Frat,389lho,cowboyhaze,2,Tue Jun 2 21:11:37 2015 UTC,"Just ended a year without a designated party house as well; only one group of brothers had a satellite house about 10 mins from campus. Social-wise, it was a difficult year; but we had some daygers at the satellite house, pool and beach exchanges, bowling, banquets, etc. You're not going to be able to have huge open parties, but if you get creative you can have great exchanges to improve sorority relations, esp. since your dues won't all be going to alcohol. On the plus side, we were able to show up alot stronger in philanthropies, community service, and brotherhood. It cut off alot of dead weight (i.e. dudes who just show up to party) for our chapter, and we're looking forward to next year, where we'll have two-three houses."

If someone doesn't already have a lease signed, or if they don't have a legitimate reason to live elsewhere, then target those people to live at the house.   If you just say ""hey guys, sign up to live in the house"" to a big group of people people are much less likely to feel responsible about signing up to live there."

Frat,389lme,jupli,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"If gaining or losing housing ever becomes a serious issue, a parlor fee provides a good incentive to live in the house.  A reduced rate of dues for housemates is a pretty good advantage.  Also, once you do have a house, make sure the mindset among new members is that living in the house is a privilege, and that if they are exemplary brothers will get the opportunity to live in the house."
Frat,389lme,Yes_Its_Me_Will,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"Your exec needs to step up and lead by example. When I was elected to my exec position it required me to live in our house even though I had a lease at my apartment lasting for another semester. I sacked up and paid for both because it was what my fraternity needed me to do. Two other members of my exec did the same thing. You can't expect people to follow you or trust you unless you earn that. If the future of your fraternity's social life is at stake then your leadership needs to man up. Offering incentives also helps, my president, treasurer, and house manager(undergrad in charge of house repairs) all get free rent. I have no idea how expensive your dues are but if you lower people's dues so that they are only paying for food/national dues/IFC dues then maybe they'll be able to move into the house despite having another lease."

Frat,3865e0,JohnOBrosley,10,Tue Jun 2 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Greek chapters do not have to be associated with universities.  They do not have to have houses on campus.  And, in the extreme, they do not have to be associated with National organizations.  The core of the fraternity experience is well chosen guys, burnished and bonded in a pledgeship, living together and adventuring together during college.  All the rest is window dressing.  Move off campus, get a house off-campus, and disassociate from the college.  Then the college - which is a public college - cannot, by law, interfere with your activities.  They cannot punish students for being a member of an off-campus organization not affiliated with the college."
Frat,3865e0,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Tue Jun 2 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"I go to school at a private university with non-national Greek life. Our frat houses are owned by the university, which has become more and more of a headache as time goes on, for liability reasons. Unfortunately, because of the school's policies, even if we convene off campus, we can still be held liable to the student code of conduct if it is concluded that we were acting in accordance with a group that is affiliated with the university (e.g. my frat). I thought you might find this perspective interesting, and would be happy to give more details. It's definitely a different world than huge campuses with national Greek orgs, but I think you'd find we have a ton in common as well.  Edit: I guess part of my point was that yes, we can convene off campus, but many universities will attempt to control this as well, like mine has done."
Frat,3865e0,bch8,2,Tue Jun 2 09:22:42 2015 UTC,Then don't affiliate with the university? I'm failing to see your problem here.
Frat,3865e0,dddane,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:49:01 2015 UTC,That's pretty much the nuclear option
Frat,3865e0,bch8,2,Tue Jun 2 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Private Universities can include anything they like in their Code of Conduct, and if you sign it, you must abide by it.  But PUBLIC universities cannot sanction you for membership in ANY off-campus, non-university-affiliated organization.   Whether the group is affiliated with a National organization still does not permit a Public university from sanctioning students if the group is off campus and not affiliated with the school.  Public universities MUST respect your US Constitutional rights, otherwise they get an easy lawsuit for treble damages - and they know that - that's why most of the recent Chapter closures have been by Nationals - not by the Public University.   Remember, SAE closed the OU chapter with the two bus crooners - not the college.  Stupidly, OU's President went further and expelled the two students, earning him a lawsuit being filed by the two students and already endorsed as a certain win by every constitutional lawyer in the country including the ACLU. And that's because OU, as a State school, cannot sanction 1st Amendment protected Free Speech.     So if Barusk's fraternities move off campus and if the fraternities disaffiliate with the school, then the school cannot touch them.  Some Nationals permit this; others do not.  If both Nationals AND the school object, then the only option is going underground - a secret society off campus and not affiliated with either the school or with Nationals."

More and more Houses will have to cut ties from colleges and from Nationals in order to retain the true core of being a fraternity.  I don't see any other way."
Frat,3865e0,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah unfortunately liability is a huge concern these days. The problem with cutting all ties is that then you have a bunch of college aged males assuming all the risk of facilitating a social scene, not to mention the risk associated with other activities we do. In the scenario if something goes wrong then the fraternity members will be thrown under the bus."

The chapter is suspended from the college, and nationals revoke rights to house operation, in which the chapter is officially dead. House operation remains against the wish of either the college or nationals, in which case this is a house that gone rogue. They either continue to operate without nationals' knowledge, against the wish of the university, or disaffiliate and go underground (secret society).   Individual member affiliation is usually determined by nationals. They review the case for why the chapter is closing down, and who should be expelled from the fraternity."

It seems he is intent on making this great fraternity into a club.    An extended safe, sane, and purposeful crucible pledgeship is essential to form the pledge bond, which is transformed at initiation to a brotherhood bond with the fraternity.  There is NO evidence that ANY educational program produces the same bond as a traditional pledgeship bond - the same traditional bond enjoyed for a lifetime by our fathers and grandfathers.  SAE suffered this same evisceration by their own Nationals Eminent Supreme Archon Brad Cohen last year, without any vote of the SAE brotherhood.  This summer, at the first opportunity to reverse that Nationals' decision, there is currently no legislation put forward by SAE's brotherhood to restore their traditional pledgeship process.  Even the brotherhood of SAE has seemingly surrendered.    It will be interesting to see if Sigma Chi's brotherhood and alumni fight back.  To whom does a fraternity belong - to its Nationals or to its Actives?  If Nationals' mission is not to protect and preserve the core traditions of the fraternity; if Nationals' mission is not to protect and preserve the ability to form and propagate the traditional fraternal bond, then what, exactly, is Nationals' purpose?  There are viable paths to run traditional fraternities without a Nationals structure, without a centralized insurance pool and risk averse attorneys.  Which is more important - preserving Nationals or preserving traditional chapters?  Sad to see another great fraternity go down."
Frat,37rz6y,newtothelyte,4,Fri May 29 23:36:23 2015 UTC,"If my fraternity got this bad, and its certainly headed in that direction, I would surrender my letters. I feel its the only way to make my voice heard."
Frat,37rz6y,ahp327,7,Sat May 30 05:39:12 2015 UTC,"Well said! As horrible as it sounds to say out loud I think there's been a disconnect between Nationals' in general and fraternity men in general in terms of what a fraternity is and what a fraternity should do. To the undergrad, the alum and the non-Nationals brother the fraternity is a place where we developed our leadership skills, honed our values, made our best friends and had a hell of a time along the way. To the Nationals' and the top-level executives its a business, and we're the customers and the employees put together. The customers, because before we pledge they have to sell us on their product, and the employees because once we're in we answer to them (at least in theory) and keep the shop running. While it's understandable that a body with millions of dollars tied up in properties and foundations and such, run at the top by (mostly) career lawyers and businessmen, would take this sort of stance, I think that in doing so they've forgotten that their structure isn't really needed for us to do what we do."
Frat,37rz6y,RobinIsAGoodfellow,17,Sat May 30 03:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think the alumni at the upper levels of most Nationals started off truly wanting to serve the fraternity that meant so much to them in college, the fraternity that factored so heavily into their personal and business success later in life.    But as these men have aged, they have become obsessively risk averse - they see every hazing incident and every politically incorrect utterance as a potential lawsuit, and they have recently become willing to throw actives and whole chapters under the bus to protect a national brand. They have forgotten that without a happy, successful, and tightly bonded class of actives, their brand has no value.  They have become shamefully timid at standing up for their brothers to college deans.  A generation ago, it was the college dean who began to sweat when the secretary told him that a fraternity's nationals was on the phone; now the reverse is true.  I think these Nationals leaders truly believe the risk averse path they have chosen is the only path to protect fraternities from collapsing under a flood of plaintiff litigation and action by college deans.  They have focused on hazing and on pledgeship as the time hazing occurs.  They have lost sight of their primary mission - to guard, protect, and preserve the fraternity and its meaningful traditions so that this generation of actives and the generation after them can benefit from the traditional fraternity experience.    A safe, sane, and purposeful crucible pledgeship is an absolutely requisite part of the fraternity experience.  Without a crucible pledgeship, there is no pledge bond.  The pledge bond is formed by the pledges struggling against surmountable obstacles, together, until all are winners, together.  Without the obstacles, with only educational modules as the foundation for pledgeship, pledging is nothing more than an extra classroom elective in Risk Management.  There is absolutely NO evidence that ANY series of educational modules can build the bond enjoyed for a lifetime by our fathers and grandfathers.  Properly executed, that deep pledge bond is transfered to a bond with the chapter and with the fraternity at large at initiation.  The bond is fed and grown throughout undergraduate life by living together, adventuring together, and depending on one another.    American college fraternities are the best success and leadership academies on the planet - second only to the United States Military (who also knows the core strategy of burnishing men by asking them to struggle against surmountable obstacles).  Traditional American college fraternities must be preserved, with their crucible pledgeships intact.  National leaders who are unwilling or unable to accept  that mission must step aside or be asked to leave.  There are viable paths to run fraternities without a Nationals structure, and outside the purview of college deans.  But those paths require actives and local alumni to step up and take leadership of their chapter.  To whom does a fraternity belong - to its actives or to its Nationals?  Which is more important - preserving Nationals; or preserving the chapter house, the actives, and their meaningful traditions?  These are important enough questions to spur debate; but are they important enough to spur action?"
Frat,37rz6y,bauer91,2,Sat May 30 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"Thankfully our president and the rest of our archonate believe in our pledging program. I spoke with him about it and he said they've all discussed it and eliminating our pledging process is out of the question, that the stupid problems that puts chapters in a bad spotlight is not the fault of pledging, but of individuals who think they're above the rules and won't get backlash for doing stupid shit. Our traveling secretaries and alumni advisory boards do everything they can to make sure we're all safe and not winding up on the news, and I do think they play a big role in how undergraduate chapters operate without vastly changing anything within the houses. Our process cannot be eliminated either without a vote of all the chapters during our convention, so it's here to stay, and I believe pledging does work in building not only a strong brotherhood but also in preparing young men to enter a world with an advantage over everyone else who saw fraternities as nothing but a waste of money.   The only big changed we've really seen is that included into our program now is an online alcohol abuse/sexual assault prevention course that all pledges must take before initiation. It's not hard, you just have to pay attention and get it done, apply those REALLY easy lessons to your life and move along.

I would just hate to see a fraternity I love and an experience that was overwhelmingly beneficial to me, both in the brotherhood aspect and helping me mature, be thrown out like this. It is the true pussification of what used to be a time honored tradition. And the user who posted about this being Greenberg's personal mission is spot on. Apparently his son came home with bruises on his ass when pledging a Big 10 chapter and ever since then he has been on a warpath. It isn't his fraternity to control. Headquarters is designed to work for us, not the other way around."

Frat,37rz6y,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Sat May 30 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"Most Nationals conventions allow legislation to be proposed by actives and chapters - or by delegates, but I don't know about alumni.  I'm not SAE, but SAE's list of proposed legislation this year includes proposals by alumni.  http://www.saerecord.net/files/docs/LawProposals.pdf  (Note: these are publicly available proposals - they do NOT include fraternity secrets)  If your Nationals does not allow alumni to propose legislation, then maybe your chapter's delegates would propose it for you.    Most Nationals require proposed legislation to be submitted in advance so that it can be posted on the convention website for review before the convention begins.  Some Nationals allow proposed legislation to be amended on the convention floor, and I think this amendment mechanism is the only opportunity SAE would have this summer to repudiate and reverse their loss of pledgeship.  Their convention is 18-20 June 2015 in Newport, California.  That amendment mechanism be also be available to Sigma Chis at their Grand Chapter 25-27 June in San Diego.  Registration for that convention closes today - and no registration is allowed on site."

Frat,37rz6y,RobinIsAGoodfellow,0,Sat May 30 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"I find it truly remarkable that both SAE's Brad Cohen and Sigma Chi's Michael Greenberg acknowledge that their unilateral actions against hazing and pledging were sparked by their own sons.  Mr. Cohen acknowledged in an interview that he eliminated pledging in SAE, partly, to protect his own high school son from future hazing.  Mr. Greenberg has acknowledged that he is changing Sigma Chi's pledge process, partly, in reaction to his own son being paddled.    Gentlemen, if the traditions that made you better men are too much of a crucible for your own sons, then counsel your sons NOT TO RUSH.  But leave the rest of the brotherhood, and their sons, and grandsons, out of your private family paranoias."
Frat,37rz6y,Nabednego,8,Sat May 30 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"then counsel your sons NOT TO RUSH.   Meh. I'm of the opinion that there are certain ahem ""traditions"" that some chapters have that really have no place in a Greek system, modern or otherwise. Paddling is one of those bullshit traditions and I have no qualms getting rid of it.  When you make a guy do things outside of his comfort zone in order to make him a more confident individual, that's (unfortunately) hazing but something that's a good thing in the long run.  When you bruise a guy up and tell him you're doing him a favor, or you pour honey and flour in his hair, that's assault. And yes, I visited a chapter where they literally tarred-and-feathered their pledges. Like, what the fuck?"
Frat,37rz6y,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Sat May 30 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Understood.  The point I was laboring to make was that the private family concerns of these two Nationals leaders, should not be cause to gut the value of the fraternities they were entrusted to lead.  These men were elected to act in the best interest of the actives.  While as a father they also have a duty to act in the best interest of their children, these two men have tragically conflated these two separate duties, and both SAE and Sigma Chi will be unnecessarily damaged as a result.  If you think paddling is assault (and most nationals would agree with you despite every Nationals leader having his own pledge paddle hanging proudly in his den) and if you know that a particular fraternity paddles their pledges, then don't pledge that fraternity."
Frat,37rz6y,featherfooted,2,Sat May 30 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know anyone who asked their parents' permission to join his fraternity.

One dude gets caught with a beer in his dorm? Whole fraternity gets in trouble. One girl decides she didn't like the way you talked to her? Whole fraternity gets in trouble. We had a tailgate for our spring football game and we had a a good number of alumni come through and the cops let us drink and party all day and then at night when all the alumni left, they came and buttfucked the row by searching every house without authorization.

Call me a dumbass if you want, I have more pressing things to worry about. Make sweeping generalizations about fraternity guys if you want, point out examples until you get back to the 1800's, I don't really care because I'm happy with my choice to join a fraternity and I'm not going to let you make me feel less so.   Some people in another chapter at another school do some dumb, horrible stuff? Sorry for the people who got hurt, but not really my concern. Some chapters only have rich white dudes? Meh, guess that's just how it is. Sometimes shit happens and fraternity guys let it slide, but I'm not apologizing or sacrificing my dignity for something I didn't do.   And you bet your ass I'm privileged. Not because of my upbringing or skin color, but because I'm secure enough in myself that whether you praise or condemn me and the brotherhood I'm a part of, it doesn't make a bit of difference. And it never will, because we're privileged and get away with everything, right?"

That's why fraternity members make up such a huge percentage of America's leaders, from Congressmen, to CEO's, to motherfucking presidents. Every single fraternity has leaders who learn money management (tens of thousands of dollars worth), who organize events that raise money for charity (how much money did that writer raise for philanthropy while she was in college?), and risk management. Every week we have to solve problems or plan events that are part of the bigger picture- that are more than just about us as individuals.

We've now put systems in place to ensure that dropping kids at the very last second can't happen. You did the right thing by showing him a little common decency."
Frat,37juff,Impune,21,Thu May 28 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"You absolutely did the right thing. If a pledge sucks, he sucks. Cut his ass from the program. But our chapter - especially when I was pledge educator - tries to clean house, if necessary, before initiation or initiation week. Cutting someone a day before initiation is simply cruel. That is a hell of a lot of emotions and it makes no sense to string them along that far.   Of course, if someone did something terrible close to initiation, they still can be cut. But you get my point. You did the right thing."

We told our dropped pledges the news the day after the vote, which we held before hell week. Barring some irreparable fuck up, hell week is meant to bring the class together while being a hilarious mind game. Unbeknownst to them, they'd really have to blow it to be dropped during hell week. If that's not enough for your president, every pledge we've dropped has been dropped due to being unfit to be associated with our chapter, so why on earth would you keep him around any longer than necessary?"
Frat,37juff,HeadCornMan,4,Thu May 28 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"I was pledgemaster for 3 pledge classes back in the day, I can say that despite what your chapter rules on this kind of thing may be, you did the right thing. He didnt make the cut, and there is no point including him on things from here out if he is undoubtedly not to be initiated. Besides, scavenger hunts are supposed ro be a fun bonding experience for pledges... Why let somebody that is not going to last be a part of that? If he sucks to much to be a brother, then he sucks to much to be allowed to have a big, fun experience with your chapter's pledges. On top of all that, having that fun night and getting to initiation night will make it a lot harder for him and the other pledges.   Besides, giving the boot to the PCP shows the others that you guys arent fucking around."
Frat,37juff,Coppin-it-washin-it,2,Thu May 28 09:27:19 2015 UTC,Difference of the opinion. I think you can be nice and drop him early while still making the pledges think they might not go through. You did the right thing man

Yeah, pledging prepares you to become a brother, but the pledges have no idea what should and should not constitute a drop because they don't know what it truly means to be a brother. Unless the kid is a complete fuck, of course, but even then the decision still shouldn't be left to the pledges."

Frat,37ka7t,jimmycheffo,20,Thu May 28 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"So my (biological) brother is a personal trainer, and gave me some solid advice: losing weight is 80% what you eat and 20% working out. I weighed ~220lbs at the beginning of the year, and as of the last time I weighed myself  (a couple days ago) I had lost roughly 20 pounds. I still drank like a fish this past semester, and I didn't go to the gym or exercise (other than walking to and from class and taking the stairs), I just quit eating like shit and ate less.   No more 3 am drunk Taco Bell runs, quit drinking soda (other than as a chaser) start drinking pretty much exclusively water and some juice. I quit eating fast food for the most part, maybe snuck in some whataburger once every 10 or so days, and started cooking most of my own food at home. When I cooked, I made sure the stuff I was buying at the store wasn't total shit either, actually look at the nutrition facts, if it's got 50 grams of sugar per serving, it's going to make you fat if you eat it a lot. Whole wheat versus white, you get the picture. Also, I quit eating as much as I used to. I'm not saying become anorexic or anything, but don't eat the whole pound of pasta in one sitting then make a pound of chicken for dinner that night.   Sorry for the essay, but that's the gist of what I did, while still drinking 3-4 nights a week (mostly beer I might add)."

For hard liquor, do non flavored liquor mixed or chased with a diet soda, or like something like crystal light. For beer, I only drink light beer, and compensate for the added calories by not eating as much beforehand, so I get drunk off less beer, and obviously don't have as many calories. For working out, to stay skinny you just have to eat less, and do HIIT cardio maybe 3 or 4 times a week, for 20 mins a session, and then toss in lifting whenever you see fit."

Even if you're taking in an absurd amount of calories if you were lifting seriously 5 times a week it wouldn't be that bad because a lot of the weight you would gain would be muscle. You need to get on a real program and do serious workouts. Going in and fucking around with some bicep curls isn't going to give you results. And you say you already work out five times a week, so you won't even have to spend more time exercising, you'll just get a lot more out of what you're doing. Look up the beginner programs of /r/fitness.   And there's no reason to stop drinking. 90% of it is calories in vs calories out so just eat less that day if you're drinking."

Avoiding late night snacks (especially if it's junk food) will help you stay slim too. For alcohol, drink liquor instead of beer.

Past that, contrary to most people on this thread, I don't see a huge problem with your reasons for pledging or for transferring.  In retrospect, it's easy to say you pledged for brotherhood, but c'mon, the vast majority pledge for social reasons and that is totally fine.  And there's nothing wrong with transferring cuz you are unhappy.  HOWEVER, the chances that the ""badass"" fraternity at a big state school with prominent greek life takes a junior transfer that fit in at a houseless, bankrupted chapter that commanded no respect from sororities (I am sorry for stereotyping here) are exceedingly slim.  Juniors almost never receive bids (and if they do, its cuz they know tons of people in the chapter).  Chances are you don't fit in at all either.  Sorry for such a novel but there were a few things to address.

Frat,37f2qn,grizzlyking,17,Wed May 27 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"If you're heavy-handed about collecting, the brothers will fall in line.  People aren't paying because they know that they can get away with it.  Set up some hefty late fees, but grant clemency to those who actually have a serious and unforeseen financial hardship.  Send everyone who won't pay to collections.  After that, nobody will think about not paying."
Frat,37f2qn,samhudson333,15,Wed May 27 04:13:27 2015 UTC,"/u/frattynuts is right. If you're treasurer, it sounds like you're doing a shit job. I bet you'll soon be in debt.  You are in control of the money. Don't let it get spent when it shouldn't be. But, there are a few things you can do to start helping your chapter. I know this can work, because I brought my chapter from debt to surplus in one year. Be warned, it will make you look like an asshole. A good treasurer is almost always an asshole though. If you can't be both compassionate and an asshole at the same time though, you may need to call in for help.  First off, make sure that only you and another trusted individual can spend money. Maybe this is the president, but from what I've seen the president tends to be an issue when chapters are having financial troubles because they think they know everything and spend accordingly. More likely, it's your chapter adviser that you trust. Even then, it should only be for emergencies or with permission. Otherwise, only you can spend money. Cancel their cards, take back their checks, remove them from the account. Once they have an understanding of how spending works, you might consider giving them cards back. How often do social chairs really need to buy things though (alcohol should be in cash; it looks real bad for insurance claims on your bank statements)  Second, you need a budget. I expect you don't have one. If you truly want to be a financially solvent chapter, this needed to happen 8 months ago for the upcoming school year. You should be planning the budget for the next treasurer. This may seem extreme, but if you have your preliminary budget planned out (basically up everything by inflation and chapter size) before you end rush, then the potential pledges will know the financial commitments. Nobody should be blindsided by a $2000 bill. You may lose some pledges because they are being financially responsible, but they would have just turned into debt if they joined. So sit down with your EC, and plan a budget and stick to it. This is easier when the treasurer is the only one who can buy things. Try not to control how people spend their money though (within reason). If social wants to blow half the budget one one party, they can go for it, but then they either only have two parties or a bunch of shitty ones. Do try and keep things legal though. If your insurance company says no kegs (it probably does), then don't let them buy kegs.  (Remember that budgets are likely semesterly, along with dues).  Make sure your planned budget is at a surplus (~10% of the total budget). This allows for unexpected expenses (a water main bursts and you need to replace the floor, or maybe there's a fire, or a freezer breaks down, or the price of electricity spikes; NOT FOR PARTIES). Once this is built up it doesn't need to be charged again until it's been drained luckily, but should keep up with your rising budget.  Also, no reimbursements without prior approval. If they didn't ask before spending money, then you should assume it's a gift. Sucks for them, but they don't know what the bank account looks like or how much bills are. When it comes to finances, the fraternity is a business and should be treated as such.  And that thing I said about them not knowing about the bank account; Fix that. Your entire EC should have a regular update on your financial standing, and where the money is going. The whole chapter should also have regular updates (though in less detail). Tell them the number of brothers that have not paid, and do the math on what's left after rent/bills (if anything). Sorry, but no parties until the heat can be paid off. The brothers should be able to attend budget meetings when they happen, so long as they are respectful (only allow committee chairs to have full vote though, to speed things up). Plus this way they can see that if they want more parties, the budget has to go up instead of just moving things around.  People may disagree with this next one, but DO NOT EVER RELY ON ALUMNI DONATIONS. At least, not for anything important. If another recession comes along and you were relying on donations for that last 30k of your budget, turns out you might be choosing between parties and running water. Especially if you have salaries to pay (house-mom, cook, cleaners?). Those people are relying on you, and you can't just skip their paycheck because the recession meant you didn't have as much money as you were expecting.  And finally, do something about the people who don't pay, alumni and active. For the recent alumni, send them a bill and tell them that they are not welcome at alumni events until they repay their debt or start making honest attempts to do so. They have a real job now hopefully, so honestly it shouldn't be too hard. Most likely they'll end up on a payment plan. So long as they stick to it and you feel there's enough money, you can eventually just forgive their debt.  Active brothers get the same option. If they have a debt from last year, they certainly don't get to live in or eat at the house this year until they've started making an attempt to pay up. If they don't make an attempt, start the process to send them to collection and kick them out. Chances are the chapter won't vote for it, but usually there's an option to go through alumni to have someone removed, even for financial reasons.   An important part of this is the word attempt. You may find that you have to council people through payment plans and debt forgiveness options. These should be encouraged for people who want them, so long as they keep up payments and you get it all by the end of the semester. Hell, maybe they even miss a payment and that's okay, but it shouldn't be because they partied too hard one night. Partying is less important than the survival of the chapter. People who are having trouble paying should have regular meetings with you (monthly) to discuss their financial standing. You could even help them set up a budget on Mint if you want to be real helpful.   I promise you if you do this you will be able to see who are and are not your brothers. There will be people who say they can't pay, but refuse to get a job and still spend a whole bunch of money on drugs. There will be people who promise to pay, then buy a new sports car as soon as they have the chance, instead of paying you.  These are not your brothers. They are parasites. They only want to take the good things from the chapter, and leave the bad for everyone else to pick up. That is not what brotherhood is. These people do not deserve to be members, and you should take action to correct the issue. Do not allow them at parties. Do not allow them at dinner. When they are gone, do not allow them in your house for brothers-only events. They are insurance risks. A true friend would have made an effort to pay, so no matter how fun they are, just remember that they're only using you. Your continued contact should hopefully be through checks that come when the collection agencies start calling them.  Remember that finances are a very delicate issue for most people. Most of your interactions will be private, though I would encourage having both your alumni adviser and your president present when starting payment plans, so the terms are fair. Be warned that this could very well ruin some relationships if you can't compartmentalize. Honestly, I suggest getting a hat. Wear the hat when you're on treasurer duty, and don't wear it at other times. Also, if you don't have an office somewhere that locks, you need one of those to have private meetings in, as well as keep documents in. Your room can stay a social place, instead of a place where people are reminded of their debts.  And finally, if you don't have an assistant, get one (or two or more). These brothers should audit your books at the end of every month to ensure they're balanced. If you trust them, allow them to get on the account. The most important part though is that they understand the budget you're planning for the next year. People who want to be your assistants are most likely the people running for your position. They'll be able to have an understanding of the system and how to run the budgets effectively (hopefully), so the next treasurer isn't starting from scratch. I would also say that you should try and make Juniors be treasurer. This way they have to live with the budget they plan, so it won't be shit, and they'll be around in case the new treasurers have questions.  And here's the best part: None of this involves fines. Fines are useless unless someone else is collecting the money for you (you should look into that). Maybe have a (small) fine on the first late payment, but if someone is already in debt, fines for each month they don't pay certainly isn't going to make them more likely to pay it. It's going to make them more likely to hate you and ignore you. Work with people, not against them."

Frat,37f2qn,Greek_Advice,4,Wed May 27 07:31:42 2015 UTC,"This is so spot on.  When I was treasurer what kept us successful was transparency throughout the EC.   Our success in dealing with people who already owed a lot was to find ways other than financial to punish them.  You can't take someone with a $600 balance and say they get a $25 late fine, they wont care about the small increase at all.  However someone with an even balance won't want an extra charge.    Like others have said, you can prevent them from attending parties and other events.  Repeatedly asking people and staying on top of them is what will get your actives to make regular payments.    At some point, having extra supporting bodies who don't pay their way makes them more burden and less supportive.    If all else fails, its time to turn to the Alumni.  Depending on how strong your alumni association is and what your relationship is.  The idea that asking for forgiveness is always better than for permission does not apply with debt.  Better to get in front of a problem bill than to ask for help later when it has four late fees attached."
Frat,37f2qn,FLOmastah,3,Wed May 27 14:14:11 2015 UTC,"I started typing a response but this is bang-on.  You're going to have to make some very tough moves over the coming weeks and months if you want to steer your chapter right. Don't be fooled - if you continue to run on empty for too long, your chapter will eventually fold.   People who aren't paying don't deserve to be in your chapter. They're ruining it for everyone. Cut off the supply for parties. Properly budget. Get your affairs in order.   Also - while this isn't something I normally push undergrads to do: this might be a scenario where you want to reach out to an Advisor and/or a nationals rep to get some guidance on how to restructure. As long as you're not a chapter that fucks up regularly, they won't hesitate to help you get back on track. But I would recommend this as a very last resort after you've exhausted everything that you, your President, and your exec board can do.   Let me know if you need any advisory on the development of your budget or anything."

They're allowed to attend parties, but it's very clear that they have to pitch since they aren't paying dues. If that doesn't work, it's time to make tough calls and start terminating those that are the most overdue. I'm willing to bet if that happened to one or two guys, they rest will miraculously find money."

As for active brothers, have half dues owed on day 1 of classes with a social probation until the dues are paid and then have the other half due say week 5 or 6 of the semester with the same punishment if things aren't paid for. It's what we do and seems to work fine. We also don't have a problem with only 3 people paying because social probation is a pretty hefty punishment."

You have to go often to grab the good/well fitting stuff, but I've gotten used Patagonia jackets and nice jeans for about 1/5 of retail. Best part is that they're already broken in and since you didn't pay that much for them, if you get them stained or marked, it won't matter if you toss them.  For polos, BU's, and shorts, I also hit up ebay. Just avoid the BNWT auctions that allow to pick colors and sizes from a huge quantity as these are usually ill-fitting Chinese knock-offs. Gotten burned that way a couple times. Ebay is also good for gear like sunglasses and jackets and sport coats.

So for Kappa Alpha it is Knight Commander that I would interview for example since he is the highest ranking. I would talk with the IFC advisers for each schools to get their views. I wouldn't go into dirty tactics just things people could talk about openly. Like if you were great at recruiting you could say that you start your events early and don't have to elaborate on your parties, the point is that you start early. Also when you break it down and look at the fundamentals it is pretty clean with what goes on. When I was president there was a lot I couldn't talk about but there was still an abundance of information that I could talk about. When you boil it down to principles and strategies there can be some really useful information. So like if you give the guy with the best grades a keg you don't have to say that you give him a keg you just say you give him a reward that he enjoys.

A cast of interesting things to try that they heard others do. Just being around like minded leaders even if it is through a podcast. Since people are at war with the other fraternities at their school they can't just schedule impromptu meetings to talk about strategies with other fraternities but with this you could just pick what you wanted to listen to. If you hear someone raise a ton of money for their philanthropy and you are planning your own but don't know where to start then it would be a good start. If grades suck and you have no academic plan then with this you could start building one.  Obviously you won't be able to listen to how people throw the worlds greatest parties or what the ritual is about but knowing how to raise $50,000 for your philanthropy and sign guys might be helpful.     I want the meat of what leaders should be focusing on and maybe it is too ambiguous but that is why nothing is created yet. The grades thing was a very poor example.   I could go in many directions even help out with how to leverage your fraternity experience by talking to heads of HR departments and CEO of organizations that hire fraternity guys to see what they look for in their candidates."

These people have probably never been to a good party in their lifetimes. They wouldn't know what to do if they were actually included. Sure you can leave them outside to fulfill their self-fulfilling prophecies, or get mad at them until you spot yourself in a Gawker post, but what happens if you invite them in for a few drinks?   Some of them decide to come in, hoping to get something potentially reputation-damaging on video, only to encounter the tamest party ever thrown. Alcohol? Psh, we don't actually let unknown guests drink, we just don't want anyone misbehaving  <sips from 'gatorade' bottle>. Dancing? Hah! That's conducive to grinding, which leads to sexual pressure which is practically rape. Plus not everyone is physically able to dance well, so let's play some cornhole instead. Someone being argumentative? Sorry, your behavior is triggering to some other guests, I won't name them but they've asked for you to leave.

I hate to sound like a broken record, but those certainly do not constitute hazing -- at least not at the state level. Your school might specifically mention interviews and say they're not allowed, but these activities do not constitute hazing at the criminal level.   One thing we can do to improve our situation as fraternities is to actually inform ourselves and become familiar with the laws and policies governing our organizations. This would allow fraternities to operate safely and legally while retaining rigorous pledging standards.  Unfortunately the majority of fraternity men I meet regurgitate the same ""everything is hazing"" line, which is indicative of how little time they've investigated in figuring out what the law actually says."

If they wanted to, most universities could call for an end to Greek life and would have the support of a majority of the faculty and student body. However, these schools won't shut down Greek life for various reasons. Instead, chapters only go down if their ""hazing"" is exposed to the public, in which case they use literally every violation as evidence against the chapter, perpetuating this whole ""greek life is terrible"" BS simply because its easier to have a group of 20-somethings take the fall, instead of the university properly addressing larger problems with the campus (but I digress).

Frat,36w0dw,afgator58,1 point,Fri May 22 18:25:10 2015 UTC,We have a house but the only time we ever talk to them is if we need help with something or if our schools rules make us call them to let them know of something we are doing (A major party or homecoming).
Frat,36w0dw,Willie_Waylon_and_Me,6,Mon May 25 05:30:52 2015 UTC,I guess y'all must be flying under the radar. Nationals came here and conducted a surprise inspection and membership review.
Frat,36w0dw,wut_is_drugs,2,Fri May 22 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"""surprise""  you're telling me they just did a membership review for no reason? I mean I dislike nationals as much as the next guy, but I can't imagine that they just go around doing random membership reviews."
Frat,36w0dw,Willie_Waylon_and_Me,2,Mon May 25 09:02:58 2015 UTC,"Well we were on disciplinary probation. All I know was we got a message to not come to the house unless we had to because nationals were there because they were checking stuff out, and they came unannounced. So I'm just guessing that's what happened."
Frat,36w0dw,afgator58,1 point,Mon May 25 18:48:07 2015 UTC,Maybe but as you know we always have someone come down every spring semester to do an evaluation and help us out if we ever need anything. They just recently switched to recent grads as the chapter consultants and the guys that come down are really eager to help.
Frat,36w0dw,Willie_Waylon_and_Me,2,Mon May 25 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"Huh, I haven't heard anything like that but I don't really keep up with all that noise."
Frat,36w0dw,afgator58,1 point,Mon May 25 18:49:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they come to every chapter. It's like a yearly eval and they come to check on the status of the chapter. It's less of a man hunt and more of a seminar.
Frat,36w0dw,Willie_Waylon_and_Me,2,Mon May 25 22:25:55 2015 UTC,That might've been it then. All I know is we were told to stay away from the house for a few days because nationals were there. We definitely don't do things by the AGR book so they wanted to minimize what got out.

Frat,36w0dw,afgator58,1 point,Sun May 24 04:44:10 2015 UTC,We definitely have as many chapter as your average fraternity but I do know that our nationals isn't huge. We are also social/professional so I'm sure that helps.

One instance that I was thoroughly disappointed: (this was before I was president, but on exec as another position)  We had our national rep in for the week to do his onsite inspection/review and it just happened to be the week before fall Rush started.   We had our monthly call with the graduate advisors because nationals always likes that. Well one of the graduates decides to start telling how he put the order in for the kegs for our ""unofficial"" off campus Rush parties. He started talking about how the graduates were pulling money, etc. We tried to stop him. The national rep just kept shaking his head trying to tune out he conversation. We got yelled at, thought we were done.   National rep mentioned it the next day, we thought at worse we would have to explain to a standards board or something. At that point nothing actually happened and it was all talk from one loose lipped grad; so we weren't too worried. He said not to worry as we're a good chapter and don't cause anyone trouble.   What happened? The fucker ratted us out to the head of fraternity and sorority life at our school and was surprised when they took action. House got charged, fined and had community service hours because of it. Also had IFC crawling up our ass the rest of the year.   We were like dude? Fucking asshole.   Same rep came back in the spring and couldn't figure out why every brother was giving him the cold shoulder and doing the bare minimum they had to for an ""official"" visit."

He doesn't see anything wrong with that, at all. Now I'm not some fashion snob or anything, but this kid looks like when he went shopping for the first time, and was told to match his outfits and did that way too literally.   He frequently will overstay his welcome in a room by a solid hour. You know those times when you and a girl are hanging out and it's late and your definitely about to do your thing? Nope. He's just sitting with you guys toying around on Instagram.   You know those times where you and your best friend are having a deep talk about something really emotional to you both? Nope. He's going to come in and toy around on Instagram. He will never speak in these situations either, just toy around on Instagram.   He doesn't drink either.

Doesn't matter, let's study together bro!  You're trying to sleep?  Come outside and have a cigarette with me!  No, what?  Dude it's a free cigarette!  He'd offer people rides all the time then try to take them back to his place to hang out.  Offers to drive you to the liquor store, on the way back want to come over to my place? Nah dude, I'm hanging out with my girlfriend. Pulls into his apartment complex anyway.  One time I was walking to the bar with a brother, he offers us a ride, we take it figuring nothing could go wrong, and he turns onto the fucking interstate.  He took us for a 40 minute drive because he didn't want to go alone.  I almost killed him.  During pledging we figured out this kid was a boner.  He acted normal around brothers but was a complete and utter fag around us.  We didn't want to tell the brothers because we figured they'd be pissed that we weren't all acting as a unit.  The fucker would go buy like 6 pizzas, bring them over to the house without being asked, then still complain that he got hazed at the next lineup.  Before hell week he went to the grocery store, unprompted, and bought a bunch of snacks and shit.  IMMEDIATELY the brothers took all the food and ate it.  What the fuck do you think was going to happen?  He then proceeded to nag everyone for money for that food that we didn't ask him to buy for months.  Fuck that kid"

It was a great experience, we all had fun and we're on great terms with them. The biggest things in my mind are: first, call ahead and ask. Nobody likes randoms turning up, brother or not.

Frat,36l2rn,Gingrich2016,5,Wed May 20 14:57:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. The fraternity you join is with you (or supposed to be) for the rest of your life. You make this decisions usually in a matter of weeks. No wonder people get it wrong.
Frat,36l2rn,quicks6x,8,Thu May 21 04:09:06 2015 UTC,"The fraternity experience has been degraded over the last decade - by State anti-hazing laws, by college deans obsessed with avoiding lawsuits, by Nationals who almost uniformly seem more interested in protecting Nationals than protecting Chapters and Actives, by political correctness on campus run amok, by SJWs and a sympathetic media who see IFC fraternities as bastions of all that is wrong in the world.  Because aspiring members are no longer privileged to pass through a crucible pledgeship, they may no longer value the fraternity as highly - because they have not personally sacrificed (to the degree you likely sacrificed) to prove their worth.  If you value something less highly, and if you invested less heavily to join, then you may be more likely to cut and run when something doesn't suit you."
Frat,36l2rn,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Wed May 20 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"This is pretty accurate, in that the value of a fraternal brother & sisterhood has drastically decreased in the last two decades of Greek Life; the average person see a fraternity as a club rather than a lifetime organization.   I want to add that back in the day people are more committed to organization that they joined because it has deeply personal and intrinsic values that they identified with, such as academia, literature, sport, military, and so on. Now a day a lot more people join fraternity because they want to get drunk and bang sorority girls. While this is an intrinsic motivation, it's also materialistic and extrinsic, because of social norms and peer pressure that scream to a person ""Hey, you're in college now, this is what you get to do and it's fun and everyone else is doing it"". And so, because of this, it actually drastically reduces intrinsic motivation to join an organization because of virtuous ideals and values, the kind of elements that are more engrained to your belief system and that are more personal to you. Thus, some people are motivated to join because of things like alcohol, women, social status, and a nice facility to party. When any of these elements are threatened, the person is less likely to do anything about it, because it's not an intrinsic value that is deeply personal to them. They believe that they could potentially just ""switch"" to a new organization that offer these terms better instead of working hard (intrinsically motivated) to better themselves and their organization.   That suck that your fraternity is on social probation and doesn't have money to throw parties and buy alcohol anymore, and that all the girls are leaving to party else where. Sorry bud, but that's not what a fraternity is all about."
Frat,36l2rn,R3xz,1 point,Wed May 20 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"At my school recruitment has shit the bed and I can't blame kids for regretting where they go, or looking back on the ""what ifs"". We have things called ""pre bids"" that fraternities use to lock kids up before the real recruitment even takes place. Kids are so misguided they take pre bids for no reason at times. It can be good because you get a bid from a solid fraternity, but you do it so fast you don't have time to weigh your options and see what is the best fit. Recruitment and tradition are not taken as seriously now a days and it's not that big of a shock why people are so quick to jump ship and look for something on the other side of the fence."

Frat,36l2rn,ilive4this,-4,Wed May 20 07:56:38 2015 UTC,You don't have to be an alum to see Greek Life has changed a lot.  You're reasoning is stupid and annoying though. Just because you see one post where someone says they don't like their house doesn't mean there is some sort of massive internal failure of the Greek system.   Dropping has been common for a long time and I seriously doubt your chapter never had some guys who joined and decided it wasn't for them.  EDIT: actually I read through your post and you seem really elitist
Frat,36l2rn,JohnOBrosley,1 point,Wed May 20 04:36:02 2015 UTC,"If I come across as elitist it's only because I have/had a high set of standards for what I wanted out of Greek life. I always knew I wanted to be a part of the Greek system and after going through rush I realized that there isn't any reason to want to drop or leave your chapter if you yourself are willing to learn what it really means to be greek and hold yourself to those standards as much as you hold your chapter to the same.  The 4 years you spend as an active aren't always going to be unicorn shit and butterflies. You'll come across shitty execs that are bringing your fraternity down, you're gonna get frustrated with the lazy pricks who show up to all the mixers but refuse to show up ever to a philanthropy event at 8am, you're going to see the direction of your rush go somewhere you don't like and your are especially going to experience situations where you may get fucked over. I think the whole point of being a fraternity man, without being too cliche, is to learn as much about yourself as possible both during hard times and bad.  I learned that the people who dropped in MY house never did so because the chapter did them wrong but because they expected everything from our chapter but weren't willing to give any of themselves to the process. I know personally I felt that in circumstances when things were bad I could cut and run and just be happy to have gotten out unscathed or realize that the positive or negative aspects of my chapter were just as much my responsibility as anyone elses. You are either a part of the problem, part of the solution or in the worst case someone who isn't willing to admit to your place in the negativity or not strong enough to take part in changing things. So yeah if your asking ""should I drop?""  Normally my first reaction is yes, you should drop, you were never a part of the process in the first place if that's how you feel, but if you're just at a crossroads then take some time to think about everything and what you're role is in all of it. Disclaimer: obviously if your being subjected to issues regarding ethics or morals that you don't believe align with what you saw at first then yes by all means. However if these are issues that you can help with grow a pair and do it..  Edit:spelling"
Frat,36j5m1,nachdemUnfall,51,Tue May 19 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"let's focus on the individual instead of blaming the entire group    FUCKING THANK YOU.   If some kid gets arrested in a dorm, would they evict all the other residents? If a member of the finance club is discovered yelling racial slurs at a party, would he be expelled?   It also will be interesting to see what happens at Arizona State with the recent news about the ΑΔΠ who caught her boyfriends house on fire. Personally, I believe that if a fraternity brother committed assault or arson, it wouldn't even be a question if that house can stay on campus either. So now we'll be able to see if the bias is against Greeks or just Fraternities"
Frat,36j5m1,Misterfoxy,12,Tue May 19 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"The different standards that apply to greek and non-greek organizations on campus are total bullshit. At my school, when someone got in trouble at a fraternity formal the fraternity as a group took a ton of heat. The individuals involved, the president/exec, and everyone else in the chapter who had to lay low knowing we were under scrutiny. When someone got in trouble at any other organization's formal (which happened just about as often), only individuals would take heat. No one would question the President of SGA if some moron got arrested at formal. No one would call for the engineering society to be shut down because someone drank too much. No one would stereotype the entire Blue Key Society as irresponsible booze hounds if their formal was annually a giant shit show."

One thing leads to another, and you end up voting him out of the chapter. It's over, right? Done?  A year later, the guy gets arrested for assaulting a woman in a bar. Some future journalist of America SJW finds out he was in your fraternity at some point, and all of a sudden your letters are in the headlines.  I'd be hard pressed to believe the same would happen to a sorority. Yeah, we're both in the same boat, but the guys are much closer to the railing."

When you refer to hazing, call it something else. I always get asked ""what did you have to do for initiation"" or ""what was your initiaton like?"" by people who are expecting some kind of hazing story. Then when a fraternity member or national organization innocently refers to ""initiation"" or ""the Ritual"", it makes us look bad because people think it refers to hazing."

The truth is that these organizations may share greek letters but they exist so far out of the realm of what greek life is its actually laughable that real Greeks would consider them to be imitators. These groups know why they exist and they don't try to be what Greeks are. They don't have mixers, they don't have houses, they don't tailgate.

There is basically nothing to do here but hang out at Greek houses, so basically every house lets almost anyone on nights when most people go out.

Open parties seem to work because only sophomores can rush, meaning no freshmen have Greek affiliations and are on the prowl for parties. As far as I can tell, the first year for students kind of works as an informal/dirty rush for freshmen. My friend was telling me about how the admin is cracking down on Greek life in many ways. Banning all hard liquor and banning freshmen in frat houses the first few weeks of school are an example.   Regarding women, I go to a similar caliber school, and there are good looking women. Elite schools are made up of varsity athletes, donor parent applicants, and generally wealthy students with good genetics and money to spend."

Four frats have permanent houses and while many sororities have a house that several sisters live in, only one has an official house. We have deferred recruitment here, so freshmen are not aloud to pledge during fall semester. It makes things tough, because most students here that are in the sophomore year or older have already made their assumptions and have their opinions on greek life. Most of the girls do awesome in the spring, and its considered a good spring if guys can get 8 or more.   Everyone generally knows each other, but our school tends to go through phases where everyone either gets along great or hates each other for years at a time. I was fortunate to be active during a time where the top 3 houses were on good terms. Sure, we competed against each other for homecoming, intramurals, and greek week, but it was quite common for us to go to each others parties and hang out (it was a bit of an unspoken rule that you don't throw your houses party on another house's night).  Graduated a year ago, and it seems like apps like yik yak, fade, and sites like Greekrank have turned everyone back against each other recently."

Sororities do a lot better, there's 6 here, ranging from 35-45 women per chapter.  I'd say our Greek Life is very close though due to how small it is at my university. The 3 largest fraternities all have our own house (not affiliated with the university though) and two of the sororities have their own houses as well, one being under the university."

Greek Week is intense because everyone is out for each other it seems.   What do you guys think helps the community come so close together? I'm friends with a good amount of people from every chapter I'd say but getting others to hang out with each other is like pulling teeth.   Also, the school just went through a year where they cracked down on partying HARD. We're actually on probation until December because we had parties during the fall and the other chapters took at us trying to dirty rush and threw us under bus to the dean of students. We still have small things but the party scene at my school basically died. It's a depressing thing."

No Greek row though, we have multiple houses in the neighborhood directly bordering the school, so parties can't be too large but they're okay. No local fraternities.

Sororities have on campus housing, but Fraternities do not. Only KA, Delts, and Sigma Chi have houses.

Also the University pretty much hates Greek life, even though our chapter completes more community service than any other organization on campus.

We make it work, and we have no official house (the local county prohibits Greek houses) we have no on campus house, but yet we constantly strive to be a performance driven chapter. In sum, Greek life kinda stinks at my school currently, however my chapter puts it upon themselves to be a positive Greek life influence. ""Poor"" Greek life is what you and your chapter make of it.

Due to lack of funds because of size and all frats being local chapters, the houses are small, picture a normal sized house for a middle class family.

We have a pretty long rush, starting in October and spilling over into February and than a 4 week pledging period.

It's good at the same time because they can see how the chapter runs things, but actually being a pledge and having to suck up to the brothers would be bullshit, but I see the strategy behind it"
Frat,36cb2a,aew360,11,Mon May 18 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"Oh god I would not want to pledge again, especially since I might be transferring to a different school this fall semester and I'll be a 4th year student"
Frat,36cb2a,nickf579,7,Mon May 18 07:01:53 2015 UTC,"It's not like we made him pledge again, he chose to.  But I'm happy he did, he was only a year older than them and he's not really close with his adopted pc.  Had he not, despite being a cool guy and all, I think he might have felt lost in our chapter and deactivated himself"
Frat,36cb2a,UW2014,2,Mon May 18 07:57:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I can understand perfectly why he would choose to do that. When I joined we already had a guy that transferred from a different school and he wasn't really that close with anyone either.
Frat,36cb2a,nickf579,9,Mon May 18 15:47:15 2015 UTC,"We take a vote and decide if we want to accept them or not as active chapter members. If we vote no, it's not like they're debrothered or anything stupid like that, but they aren't allowed to vote in chapter or use the pledges or go to formal. If we vote yes to accept them, then they kinda take a semester off and see how we work with pledges and set up different activities and events so that when he is officially accepted at the end of the semester, they have a general idea of what's going on"
Frat,36cb2a,aew360,-11,Mon May 18 07:11:55 2015 UTC,I don't see why they wouldn't be allowed to use pledges if they got a no vote. They are still brothers. Would you let a visiting brother from another chapter use pledges?
Frat,36cb2a,sublimefan42,46,Mon May 18 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"No. Those are my pledges, get your own."
Frat,36cb2a,Wheream_I,10,Mon May 18 09:00:48 2015 UTC,"Fuck. No. And here's why: 1. They have no ties to the chapter. They do not understand our individual chapter's hazing policies. We personally do not physically harm pledges. We just fuck around with them and treat them like people. If that brother came from an SEC school where he got his balls hazed off and tried to pull an egg drop on one of my pledges and it gets exposed, he just put our chapter at risk.  2. He hasn't earned to use our pledges for rides. We make the pledges address unaffiliated brothers and chapter alumni as ""Brother whoever"" but they are not to give them rides unless they individually agree, but are not required to and will be defended by us if the unaffiliated bro bitches about it. 3. Each chapter and each fraternity has a different method to molding and instructing pledges. It starts at a national level, then some parts are left up to the chapter. Maybe we're big on teaching them to not be fucks to GDIs, but the newcomer tells them to be total prick to some geeds for his own amusement. That would go against what we personally stand for and would give the pledges a conflicting pledgeship where they are told two different things. That could potentially compromise their entire learning experience.  TL:DR: never let a transfer brother or visiting brother use your pledges because God knows what he wants to do to them and that could fuck your chapter over"
Frat,36cb2a,aew360,-10,Mon May 18 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"Lol no, if you're visiting you are lower than a pledge"

Frat,36cb2a,aew360,8,Mon May 18 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as a large football school and one of the top party schools in the nation other schools are just annoying. ""Brothers"" at smaller schools think that they can just make these unannounced road trips to our school and are entitled to tailgate with us, party with us, act like assholes to pledges, and overall just play ""frat star"" for a weekend. Sorry but farm league guys don't just get to walk into the mlb clubhouse whenever they want"
Frat,36cb2a,Damngladtomeetyou,3,Mon May 18 15:46:20 2015 UTC,I could see that. Every game day they seriously put y'all at risk because to the school your chapter's responsible for every person that shows up to the house drunk off their ass
Frat,36cb2a,aew360,2,Mon May 18 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"We have this problem here too. 9/10 it is annoying as shit when guys from shit chapters show up at our house or at our tailgates and expect us to roll out a welcome wagon and let them drink our alcohol without contributing or bringing girls. My friends in other SEC chapters have talked about the same problem, some jabronis from Directional State Tech University showing up on Saturday morning. We aren't rude by any means but we have a firm line. And it's not always bad, we had some guys come to our bid day last year and they threw in money for the bar tab, brought beer and girls and contributed to the party overall. But that was the exception not the rule."

IMO and experience transfers shouldn't be given the benefit of the doubt. The whole brotherhood thing is a nice concept but realistically pledging an organization at a different school makes you more different usually than guys in different chapters at the same school."
Frat,36cb2a,the_reddit_intern,2,Mon May 18 10:19:26 2015 UTC,We just had a guy come in like this. We invited him to our events and tried to see if he fit with our chapter since he didn't want to be officially part of the chapter. He still paid to the slush fund.   He came to our president a few weeks ago and asked to be part of the chapter. We then voted him in.

I think if we did have a guy come in from some no name school we'd probably think about it a bit more. Both of these guys came in and had really good insight and fit in seamlessly. I think if the guy shows effort before really getting to know everyone it's pretty much a no brainer.

Those chapters are pretty successful on campus but the guys that have joined since my freshman year are some of the closest friends I have ever met and my goal has always been to improve my chapter to where they are successful as those other chapters I could have joined (yeah, I know, ""TKE sucks""). I've enjoyed this experience though, I see it as a challenge and I think I have helped this chapter make a lot of progress. Don't think I would have learned as much about myself or life in those other chapters but who really knows.   Grass is always greener for sure."

Tried to leave for a while, seeing if there was some way to try and pledge somewhere else to no avail. Kinda just accepted my fate, all I can do now is just try and improve the chapter.

You should let the houses know that you don't want to drink and if they aren't okay with that then they won't give you a bid but the houses that are okay with that will still give you a bid and then you'll know you won't have to worry about it.

Our pledge educator and president both made it clear to us during the first pledge class that if any brother tried to pressure is to drink to let them know and that they would deal with them severely. The fraternity experience (as intended by the founders), and especially pledgeship, are not about drinking. Stay away from anyone who tells you differently.  Prior to seeking/accepting a bid find a guy in the chapter who you trust and ask him about how your decision to not drink will be received. Personally, I chose to drink throughout my pledge semester (despite my busy schedule) and I learned how to manage alcohol (I learned this the hard way... many times). Out of 28 guys in my pledge class, 6 didn't drink at all during pledgeship and they enjoyed a fulfilling pledge experience all the same. My advice is to find a group of men who will support your decisions and help you in the first steps of one of the greatest experiences of your life."

Of course we didn't always follow this rule but we were rolling the dice on not getting caught. Point is that not every fraternity exists only to drink. As time goes on you'll realize (despite the stereotypes) that we take part in dry events as well.  You should make aware the pledge ed or some higher ups your concerns about drinking during your pledgeship and like many other people here have said they should respect your choice and if they don't then that house isn't the right one for you anyways.  Also don't let your mental health issues hold you back from your pledgeship. When or if you feel comfortable sharing that information I would encourage you to do so with either a pledge brother or initiate you bond with. I think you'd be suprised the amount of support you'd receive as well. Enjoy your pledgeship. It's the most fun you'll never want to have again. I promise you it will be tough but if you stick it out you'll learn alot about life and yourself.

The best thing to do is get in the school's good graces right away with visible philanthropy and all that good stuff. That way they give you the benefit of the doubt. When we got started we put a heavy emphasis on having awesome parties and put philanthropy second, and the school fucked us whenever they could. They told campus police and actual police to drive by our house frequently (I've talked to cops about it, they told me) and they hit us for hazing when a girl at our party snapchatted another girl telling one of our pledges to drink.   When one of our guys did something dumb and some radical feminist students went to the media and lied about it, the school ignored our side and evidence. Nationals didn't even try to defend us because the news had made us look bad and they just wanted us gone. They're like that because they're trying to expand westward to other schools and want to be able to have a shining reputation at the expense of pulling the plug on any chapter they think might make them look bad, even if they're (mostly) innocent."

Frat,35vdhk,Ras_TafarhIgh,6,Thu May 14 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"Contrary to popular belief, they were not kicked off solely because the football players attempted an armed robbery at their house. The fraternity's president was heavily suspected of selling drugs out of the chapter house after the football team's robbery incident, so it did have some effect. However, the big issue with the school came when police caught their president dealing drugs out of the house first-hand due to a tip-off to the San Luis Obispo Police Department. Once the school had proof of drug possession and sale from a registered fraternity house, the chapter was placed on investigation for most of the year, and they were finally kicked off this week. They could have been kicked off last September, but they waited for the result of the court case against the chapter's president."

Don't let the girls go wondering around the French Quarter unaccompanied after dark.  Unless you want peace and quiet (unlikely), you'll want to stay in the heart of the French Quarter - some French Quarter Hotels: http://www.frenchquarter.com/hotels/ Walk from there.  Paddlewheeler steamboat cruise - http://www.steamboatnatchez.com/  May need buses to transport from and back to hotel.  Crawfish Boil - catered - crawfish, jambalaya, gumbo, gator tail, corn, potatoes - http://www.crawfishking.com/ Ask them for a suitable outdoor, park-like location, walkable from your hotel, maybe by the river, to stage the boil.  Your hotel may let you stage the boil in their courtyard since you're blocking a lot of rooms.  Live Jazz at Preservation Hall - or book the Preservation Hall Band for your dinner or for the crawfish boil - http://www.preservationhall.com/   Sober up at Cafe du Monde - the original location at the French Market in the French Quarter on Decatur -  with chicory coffee and fresh beignets. http://www.cafedumonde.com/history"

Oh - and no raw oysters in warm months - Apalachicola Bay Oyster beds (most of what is served in Nawlins) are washed by the outflow of the Mississippi River, and vibrio contamination is high in the summer - only eat raw oysters in months with an ""R"".    For the amount of money y'all are going to be investing in this trip, you should make some preliminary choices, and then fly out this summer to personally inspect the hotel - gauge the walking distances to other interests, try the riverboat, sample the catering of the crawfish boil, check out cafe du monde and Preservation Hall.   Then if everything looks good, sign the contracts and hand over the deposits.  The hotel you are considering will likely put you up for free during the inspection trip."

Frat,35sa8y,Kylejk14,4,Wed May 13 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"I'm in a Penn State fraternity. Don't worry about anything until fall semester. The first week of ""rush"" consists of Zone Days where you'll be able to go to as many houses as you want, and meet the rush chairs/brothers. You obviously won't be able to make it to all 45+ fraternities, but have a general idea of where you want to go. If you have friends on your floor that you're rushing with, I'd advise for all of you to split up. Joining a fraternity (especially at Penn State) is all about finding the right fit. You won't be able to find the right fit if you're just looking to stick with the kids on your floor/friends.  About during the summer... there isn't much going on anyways. Our rush chairs haven't done much yet and don't often receive emails (I'm assistant rush chair this fall). No extra email this summer is going to get anyone's attention anyways. A lot of rush depends on your appearance on Zone Days - how much time you spend at each house, who you meet, numbers you get, etc.  At the end of the day, just be yourself. There's nothing more annoying than seeing rushes act fake in order to fit what they believe to be the fraternity's ways. Also, enjoy summer session while you can. I know a lot of kids that went through it last year and they all made great friendships that I wish I could have going into my first semester.   Anyways, good luck. Maybe I'll see you in the fall if you rush. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Penn State Greek life is amazing, you'll love it.   Edit: First few weeks of Freshman year aren't as exciting as you'd think. It doesn't matter how many girls you have with you, you won't get into any fraternities unless you know a brother personally (there are just too many freshmen). My advice: buy your own booze and find an apartment to go to or some place off campus, invite kids on your floor (girls especially) and have a good time. Rush is pretty much the first time of the semester any fraternities will let freshman guys in anyways."
Frat,35sa8y,dbidb,1 point,Wed May 13 03:51:03 2015 UTC,You can't really rush any frats during the summer. But as a Penn State student I can tell you my biggest regret was not pledging fall semester. So make sure to visit lots of frats during rush week as you'll be bound to find the right one for you. P.S. Greek life here is awesome; you'll have an awesome time
Frat,35sa8y,Anal_Archaeologist,1 point,Wed May 13 09:12:26 2015 UTC,"I go to PSU. There are usually 2-3 houses that throw down in the summer, but no actual rush events. If you went out to these houses and showed interest I'm sure they'd invite you to stuff in the fall. I rushed a lot of houses in both the fall and spring and during the 2(?) Weeks of rush I was going to two or three events a night. I would recommend checking everywhere out and see which one fits you best, with over 40 frats I'm sure you'll find one. Fall is the better semester to pledge but I myself pledged spring due to academic reasons. If you have any questions about PSU Greek life feel free to message me, good luck"

Frat,35pl0c,BourbonAndFrisbee,7,Tue May 12 19:29:48 2015 UTC,Boat shoes. Though I do see people who think dressing nice involves wearing a polo logo.
Frat,35pl0c,StPatsLCA,81,Tue May 12 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"The stereotypical Southern fraternity look is really not prevalent anymore on campus, except at SEC schools, at big flagship Southern campuses like UNC and UVa, and at a few very old and very traditional schools like University of the South and College of Charleston.  The look originally grew out of the simple fact that WWII GIs, returning to campus after the war had their khaki pants from their uniforms, had OCBD shirts and blazers from their Sunday clothes, and very little else - so they repurposed those clothes for regular wear to class.  Brooks Brothers catered to the look, along with some small local Southern men's clothiers in the South and in New England - J Press, Ben Silver, M. Dumas, Julian's, The Hub, Varsity Mens Wear, Nowells.  Basically, the American Trad look was just a way for fraternity men to set themselves apart on campus - to have a unique look that reflected the traditional values they believed in and tried to live.  The look was passed down from father to son - kids dressed that way because the men in their family dressed that way - and those kids took that look to campus when they went to college and pledged.  I like the look, and the clothes are comfortable and durable.   The Uniform at Carolina was baggy cuffed khakis with a fitted waist and seat, a short sleeve polo or an OCBD with the sleeves rolled up, a needlepoint belt, no socks, and topsiders or Weejuns.  Add a navy blazer (the Carolina Tuxedo) and you were presentable at almost any function.  Again, I like the look, and I like the traditional heritage of the look - my father and grandfather wore the same look when they were on campus - and I like that link to them."

Frat,35pl0c,Olbermann-is-a-Geed,8,Tue May 12 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"i could be wrong, but i thought  the reason that people dress fratty is usually cause their prep schools had them wear khakis and blazer and it carried over?  thats why i gravitated towards that"
Frat,35pl0c,RandyPandy,2,Tue May 12 23:11:12 2015 UTC,"Good point. That Prep School uniform of khakis, white OCBD, school tie, and navy blazer was brought by New England prep school graduates to college campuses.  But that tradition of elite prep schools was mostly a New England tradition.    The largest single bump in US college attendance ever was GIs after WWII, using their new GI Bill college benefits in the 1950s to attend college  - often as the first member of their family to do so - and almost always after being drafted or volunteering for the US Military straight out of public high school - not out of prep schools.  In the South and and most SEC schools, the prep school tradition was not nearly so strong as it was in New England - almost all students in high school in the south pre-WWII attended public high schools - all socioeconomic classes from the poorest to the wealthiest kids.  It was only after the ""white flight"" of the 1970s as a result of Federal forced desegregation and bussing that private elementary and high schools became common in the south.  It is true that GIs attending southern colleges in the 1950s likely saw pictures of the navy blazer / white OCBD / khakis New England style uniform as they themselves readied for college.  But the reason these recently victorious GIs brought that look to campus, is that was what they already had - the khaki pants from their uniforms, and the navy blazer and white OCBD from their Sunday clothes.  The traditional bagginess of the khakis at the time led to the derisive term ""frattybagger"" to describe 1950s fraternity men on southern campuses.  But that bagginess in fit was a simple result of the weight loss that often occurred on deployment overseas to well fed southern boys newly forced to subsist on GI rations.  The loose fit and slightly rumpled look persisted in chapter houses, at least in the South, through the 1980s, until ""Animal House"" changed the way fraternities were viewed and the way fraternities viewed themselves.  The more recent ""stigma"" attached to the American Trad style of dress developed slowly as class differences festered on campus and in society, as college fraternity men became an easy target for SJWs of ""Occupy"" and other movements, as examples of supposedly unearned wealth and unearned privilege.   The resulting backlash against capitalism, entrepreneurial success, and supposed family wealth also resulted in a backlash against the style of dress the simplistic SJW crowd imagined of their enemies.  And so in the 1990s and the 2000s, fraternity men seemed to return to a T shirt and jeans look that blended them more evenly on campus with GDIs.    Another story of the ""Fraternity Look"" emerging on Southern campuses -  Bass Weejuns (short for Norwegian)  became an iconic part of the fraternity look - the classic penny loafer without socks.  That trend started on campus in the late 1950s in fraternity houses at UNC Chapel Hill, was picked up and mentioned by the Daily Tar Heel, the UNC campus newspaper in 1960, and over the next two years, production and sales of the shoe increased 20-fold as the look spread from chapter to chapter through the South and then through New England."
Frat,35pl0c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,9,Wed May 13 02:25:13 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone was required to dress up for class pre-WWII. Also, the Greek student body at UNC-Chapel Hill looks no different from the Greek student body at NC State, ECU, or pretty much anywhere else. That look is still prevalent (if not growing) pretty much everywhere."
Frat,35pl0c,Gingrich2016,1 point,Wed May 13 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Very true.  That's part of my point - dressing for class was expected.   You showed respect for the privilege of being educated at a university.  But how the returning GIs met that expectation and how that evolved to the fraternity look on Carolina's campus and at other southern colleges is the story I was trying to tell.  I am under the impression that the American Trad look on college campuses - The Uniform / The Carolina Tuxedo - khakis / OCBD, blazer, bowtie, topsiders or weejuns was fading - and had been since the 1990s.  If you find it to be prevalent and growing, that (from my point of view) is a good thing."
Frat,35pl0c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Wed May 13 04:46:45 2015 UTC,"That makes sense now - very interesting history. I thought that look was popularized in the '80s in ""The Official Preppy Handbook"" and originated in New England cities like Cape Cod. It was definitely re-ignited by that book and re-popularized again recently.   Are you sure you are not talking about the SEC? There is no way UNC or UVA kids have a monopoly on it. I have never even heard the phrase ""carolina tuxedo,"" and I personally would not be able to distinguish between someone from a UNC 'elite' fraternity from an average fraternity guy at any other average state school based on appearance."
Frat,35pl0c,Gingrich2016,1 point,Wed May 13 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The Preppy Handbook over-popularized what was previously a niche look, and took away some of the purpose of the look - namely to create a distinctive look for fraternity men - to set them apart on campus.  I think the American Trad look is now even more prevalent in SEC fraternities than at UNC, and I think the origin of the look at SEC schools was most likely the same as at UNC - returning GIs making good use of what they had.  As in North Carolina, I think the direct influence of the prep school look (prep school kids matriculating at UNC or at SEC schools) was less a factor than in New England.   For New England colleges, I think the prep school kids bringing their prep school uniform with them to college was the predominant factor in creating the fraternity look on New England campuses.  But for the ACC and the SEC, I think the returning tsunami of GIs had more influence than the very small number of New England prep schoolers matriculating in southern colleges in the 1950s."

Frat,35pl0c,CarltonFrater,14,Thu May 14 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"Yea in the Northeast there is a stigma.  Even in my own chapter, some of the older guys didn't like it if we wore vineyard vines, or even bowties at dress up parties.  I like the style a lot and a few guys at my school pull it off, its a shame it isn't accepted up north.  Its probably because they see the negative stereotypes of frat guys, and dressing nice is one of them.  So they assume that we're douche bags etc just because of dressing nice."
Frat,35pl0c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,7,Tue May 12 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"The bowties were favored over neckties because you were less likely to spill your drink on a bowtie.  Plus, again, fraternity men were looking for a traditional look that set them apart on campus - and the bowtie fit in well with that.  No pledge at Carolina made it to initiation without being able to tie a bowtie."

I'm a t-shirt and jeans kind of guy (I guess it's my California casual roots) but I'm in the minority. Most people at my school dress pretty well, Greek or not.  NYC is sort of known for people to dress well, though -- so even if people aren't wearing blazers to class they're still generally dressing well -- fashion forward and untraditional as it may be, most take pride in their appearance. (This might also have something to do with the general affluence of the student body.)  Also, I'm not sure why you'd have that impression that Greeks down South dress nicer. We've all heard this stereotype, but I haven't personally seen it. Most the videos posted here are just a bunch of guys in shorts and muscle tees, jumping around to EDM. It's pretty standard college attire."
Frat,35pl0c,MischiefSupreme,2,Tue May 12 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that at UVA there's no major stigma about dressing up, almost everyone wears khakis and button downs when going out. That may be as far north as you can get with that happening though."

Frat,35pl0c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,-10,Tue May 12 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"Another point (I guess I'm feeling wordy today), dressing for class shows respect for the privilege of being genuinely educated at a good college.  In the near future, MOOC classes may completely replace the on-campus college experience for 95% of students, and only the very brightest, most promising candidates may be selected to attend elite universities for the on-campus personal experience.  The economics of MOOC education vs a traditional on campus experience is just too stark.  Dressing for class is a way of showing respect for the privilege of getting an education; most of society is ""trained"" not educated."

Some are strictly summer rush, some are strictly fall or spring, some are year round. But I'll try and throw you a bone anyway: Start by researching the chapters at the school you're going to. Which ones based on their mission statements and general feel do you think you'll fit in with? Ask people (girls are better than guys) what they think of the chapters at that school, and that should give you some indication about what each house is known for i.e. druggies, meat heads, weirdos, etc.  Then, after you have a general idea of a few you like more than others, go to their chapter's website and find the contact information for their rush chairman and shoot them an email. Tell them who you are, where you come from, how old you are, and a few other details about yourself you think might be important for them to know. Could go something like this: ""Hi, my name is Needledick McFuckface and I'm interested in rushing Lambda Lambda Lambda this fall. I would really like to get to know you and see what your chapter is all about. I'll be in Athens next week, can we set up a time to meet?

Best thing to do is to go to Mizzou's IFC page and Email Rush Chairs. You'll almost certainly get invited to events this summer in your home town and to rush parties the first week of school.

Texas is the best Greek school in the state in general and the best academically among all those, and Tech is pretty solid too. A&M is an academic school almost on par with Texas, but it's maybe slightly better than Baylor over in Greek life. Honestly breaking down by Greek systems it's:  Tier 1: Texas, TCU, SMU, Tech Tier 2: A&M, Baylor Tier 3: Texas State, SFA, SHSU, Southwestern Tier 4: UNT, UTD Tier 5: UTA, UTSA, UTT and whoever else."

Frat,35mr9a,CBJ17,1 point,Tue May 12 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"Like the people below have said go to a school for academic reasons and things other than the quality of the school's Greek life. It isn't wrong to weigh that when making your decision but it should be secondary to other factors. That being said it breaks down like this:  A&M, Tech and UT are all known for having great, large public school systems. I can only speak for A&M from experience and I personally love it. We have grown significantly since the SEC move and the quality of the system is great. UT is known for being large, and very old line, as in if you're asking which UT frah is best on Reddit you probably aren't getting into a good one. Tech is known for being wild, I grew up with a lot of FIJIs and Delts and they love it. The women at all three are top notch but I'll give Tech the edge there  For the private schools SMU and TCU both have great Greek systems with an old line system similar to UT. They also both have a higher number of out of state kids. Baylor is also not bad but I can't really speak for them. It seems very nontraditional, I don't think Baylor has greek housing.   I don't much care for Texas State but their Greek life is smaller and half decent. It's a party school by nature and from what I can tell geed house parties and pool parties with Twitter hashtags take precedence over Greek life. Hot women though.  The smaller tier is schools like SFA, UNT, UH and SHSU. From what I can tell SHSU Greek life is nonexistent, UNT seems kinda cool but I have heard they have draconian policies such as having cops inside the house for parties checking ID's. SFA has a good Greek system for a smaller school, and UH looks shitty.   The final level is small schools like UTA, Lamar, Tarleton etc. I can't speak to any of them but I wouldn't expect much."

Up until a couple of years ago, they made their pledges kill a kitten by ripping it apart before they got initiated (I wish I was kidding). After they lost their charter, they destroyed their house which was University owned by shitting everywhere and pissing everywhere in the house. The house was so disgusting before that they found a dead raccoon upstairs under a couch that was completely rotten and nobody apparently noticed/cared. They were just a fucked up group of dudes."

However, I'm sorry to say it man, but they were someone to stay far away from here. I meet one guy who seemed normal until I beat him in a game of BP and he literally started punching himself in the face (he might have broke his nose, I don't know?). Moreover, the one time I went there to check the place out as a freshman, most of the guys were strung out on something or playing video games by themselves.

Frat,35jwre,CarltonFrater,2,Sun May 17 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"Last school year they were top tier in terms of partying until they were reviewed. 8 guys stayed and rebuilt into a house worth a shit as far as fraternities go. The 80+ guys that either didn't clear the review or just left continued to operate as the ZOO. This past school year they threw some of the biggest, most ratchet parties (like Old Theta Chi did) and probably underground pledged but they weren't allowed to advertise their house around campus during IFC rush like Sig Chi and TKE were. (or violated rules in order to do) In any case word on Twitter sounds like the ZOO is disbanding probably due to the fact that they won't own their apartment complex they operated from anymore.  As for Theta Chi that still exists on campus, they're a great bunch of guys. The IFC President is a ΘΧ and a great leader in my opinion. I'm good friends with a handful of their guys as is true with a handful of my brothers and other Theta Chis. They've taken two quality pledge classes this last year. They came out of nowhere to win AXOs philo which is a pretty well known philo. Delta Zeta loves them, which is impressive since they're smaller since reconstituting while DZ has been a top tier sorority here for a while. They were good at basketball and made playoffs in football and softball but got bounced in the first round in those two sports. They started their flag football philo at the end of last semester and it's got potential but I think a lot of people were either out of town or preoccupied with studies to show out. Theta won overall even though we piled 10 touchdowns on AKL but hey, gotta let the girls win things. Overall, ΘΧ here is doing good things. I think and speak highly of them."

Also, if it won't pass inspection, you can easily hold that over their heads.

I've personally never been but I know they can accommodate large groups and have amenities that are pretty cool, roof top bar, pool, etc. They cater some of the meals and have a ballroom that fits well over 200 people comfortably."
Frat,35ez2e,PPKA2757,4,Sat May 9 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"I went to PIKE U at the Peabody in January, can confirm. Very historic building, beautiful, and they have ducks that just wander around the lobby. Awesome place if you can afford it with a 55 man chapter budget."
Frat,35ez2e,jallen1868,2,Sat May 9 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"Went there for Pike U this January. I think it would be a great hotel for formal. They were pretty tolerant of drinking/noise, especially for as nice a hotel as they are.  They have ducks walk through the lobby at 11am and 5pm, girls would probably get a kick out of it.  There's several large ballrooms and a nice lobby bar. It's within about 2 blocks of Beale Street, which is pretty good. You probably wouldn't want to be walking around the city with your dates too much besides Beale Street though.  My chapter paid for it, but I heard it starts at about $200/night for a 2 queen bed room.  So with 2 couples a room, it would be about $200 for the weekend for each guy."

So it might not be a traditional frat experience which doesn't mean bad unless you are looking for that. However some of the pharmacy frats and business frats actually do have really arduous pledge processes and haze so that could be the case for you.

Obviously I don't know KKP at all or what school you are going to but be prepared for anything. I am in a traditional fraternity but I know a bunch of people that went into business or academic ones. They might be a really tight knit frat that will make the pledge process brutal or it might be less of a fraternity where you sort of just join and you are in. Either way keep an open mind and have fun.

If you just want to have loud music fill a room or hallway you'll want to get powered (also called active) speakers that have an amp built in. Check craigslist for djs/people selling their party systems. You can get a used PA speaker for around $200 if you look around. Getting passive speakers and a separate amp or receiver will give you better sound (depending on your subjective view of good) and a little more flexibility with equalizing and hooking up multiple inputs and will also be much smaller."

Houses are under a lot of pressure to avoid the negative stereotype of racism, especially following the incident at Oklahoma. In my experience, there can be tendencies of racism from some members in different houses but it is almost always the minority. After this year especially though, many houses have struck down any sort of racist traditions/chants/sayings that are common in a house. It is no longer tolerated as it is foolish, immoral, and a huge liability to everyone in the chapter. Our house this semester rushed eight newly activated members, three of which were asian, one actually from South Korea.

I used to be a scrappy little 160lb sophomore with a six pack. So why am I a 230lb man now?? Is it my love of grilling red meat while consuming heavy lagers every Sunday? Is it because I now work in an office for ten hours a day in a management position? Maybe it's because I now own a sports car and no longer ride a ten speed bike wherever I go. No. It's none of that. It's because I want to crush the respect of woman with my grizzly like girth.  If only the author knew that my fiancé likes my physique because I look like a man that can protect her. Instead of crossfit or hitting the erg (which my lower back now hates) I go to the gym three times a week and pick up heavy fucking shit and reward myself with a bacon burger. I like the way I look. I'm like a lumber jack that's been on vacation too long.  As far a my fiancé's body, if anything I'd say she's got a ""mom bod"" which for whatever reason (genetic? Who fucking knows) I'm really attracted to that now. Her work out consists of watching Dallas on her phone while Kick'n it on an elliptical for a half an hour. I'd take her over some skinny ass 18 year old girl that religiously goes to spinning classes any day. Maybe it's because I'm seeking out a more parental looking partner to one day raise my kids, or maybe it's because I love that woman and don't really care about her having Michelle Obama arms.  She looks like a woman. I look like a man. Neither of us are what I'd call fat or unhealthy. We're just real adults. We had our time when she would juice cleanse for her ZTA composite and would go to daily HIIT training sessions with the bros. Now we focus our energy on things that matter. Like paying our bills and investing our money.

We make them do basic stuff like cleaning, but pledging consists of learning the history of the chapter, getting to know members, learning new skills, lots of team building activities and learning how to set up a philanthropy, brotherhood, party, social etc.   Hazing makes pledge classes tighter, it does not make chapter brotherhood tighter."
Frat,351wdr,Impune,3,Wed May 6 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"Hazing doesn't bring the pledges closer to the house,  true.

However, I also know that there are ways to achieve those ends without hazing, and that hazing goes against every single fraternity's values. (Let's be honest, the men who founded our fraternities 100+ years ago didn't haze anyone, and you can be sure they never imagined their societies would turn into what they have with regards to hazing today.)  Don't blame weak pledge classes on an absence of hazing. Blame it on your inability to establish a rigorous, hazing-free pledge process. It takes a little creativity, a lot of dedication, and consistently high standards, but it's definitely possible.  Hazing is what dumb pledge masters resort to when they're too lazy to design non-hazing methods of instilling their organization's virtues in their new members."

The person with the most votes wins.  Before votes are cast we allow each candidate to give a 2 minute speech, answer a few questions, and then once they've all given their speeches the chapter discusses it a bit more, pro/con/pro if necessary.

If there is a tie we have a second round of voting between the tied candidates, but even this is rare because generally one or the other will step down and concede to the other candidate.  We like the approval system (voting for everyone you approve of) because it usually means the people getting elected are those with the broadest support, instead of just those winning a plurality."

We'll do simple themes but generally don't commit beyond costumes with the exception of our annual parties like beach party, beer slide party, and rave party.  Simple things that you do every party raise the quality of generic parties a lot. For instance, figuring out who is good at DJing and having them DJ every party. A good DJ is so much better than a spotify playlist. My house also stands out because we get tequila and limes and salt so people can do tequila shots- brothers and girls both love that yet nowhere else on campus has tequila for parties. Setting up a pong table on our back porch for the cig smokers and people who want to cool down helps keep them happy.

While I'd encourage you to always strive to be the better man and be welcoming and courteous to everyone who turns up to your public events, I can also appreciate the desire to tactfully prevent events being ruined by people acting strangely or annoying other attendees.  In the latter case, I'd suggest having one or two brothers babysit them. Talk to them nonstop so they don't have a chance to make it awkward for anyone else. Guide them around the event (read: away from other people) so they can feel involved without actually creeping anyone out.  I don't think there are many times when we've ever had to actually do this, though. Most awkward people are just there trying to make friends or involve themselves in something. No need to shame them for attempting to broaden their social circle or break out of their comfort zone. Insecurity isn't an attractive quality, so unless they're actually being super weird to people, try just being a normal human being toward them and see how that works out."

Not to white knight or anything but that's some shitty way to see it man, a hand full of those socially awkward people are probably great people in any other situation. Most of them would probably have been your good friends if Frat guys like us didn't pick on them through out school.  To answer your question though I've always preferred to just pull em aside and ask them nicely to tone down what ever there doing as long as they're not scaring people.

No, we don't get unlimited supps just because of a sponsorship, you get a set amount that you are given for being a brand rep.

Frat,34was1,Satreavneyni,74,Tue May 5 02:15:40 2015 UTC,Our tier system is solely based on GreekRank.com rankings and we pay sweatshop children to up our rankings.
Frat,34was1,JohnOBrosley,10,Tue May 5 03:03:45 2015 UTC,IU? Sounds like IU.
Frat,34was1,generalcam,9,Tue May 5 15:36:54 2015 UTC,IU
Frat,34was1,generalcam,7,Tue May 5 16:25:03 2015 UTC,Fellow Hoosier here. IU just happens to be one of those Greek systems where people unfortunately care a lot about where they fall in the tiers. I think that IU is the extreme and not the example. IU has one of the worst greek communities in terms of coming together. You'll see that it takes a tragedy for us to come together as well as most of the housed Greek population really looks down on independent students and plays into a lot of stereotypes of the Greek community. I think if IFC and PanHel would work to bring all the Greek community together then you might see some of the rigidness of the tier system at IU fall apart.
Frat,34was1,generalcam,3,Tue May 5 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Cool! I have a couple friends in your chapter. Good kids. I agree though. Even with the deaths in our system this past school year, you can truly see the fragmentation throughout the community. I heard a few kids from another chapter complaining at the recent vigil that they never knew Hannah Wilson, and GPhi would never give their house the light of day, so why should they support greek unity and trash like that. It just sucks.  When are you guys gonna get a house?"
Frat,34was1,generalcam,3,Tue May 5 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"Nationals say 2-5 years, but we need to get to and sustain 100-120 members first, as well as a lot of other hurdles to jump through, so I wouldn't hold my breath. Us and Pike are kinda in the same boat, both looking to get onto campus at the Tennis Court Lot, but I've heard Hillel is looking to build there too. Our best chance is gonna be to rent something if it opens up for 2016-2017.  It's true, the only sororities that give us the time of day are the unhoused ones (DPhiE, ASA, TPA). We had a ""pair"" with ADpi, and they sent 12 girls so, you can really see that the house effects everything at IU,even though our former sweetheart is in ADPi and its unfortunate that the attitude is so prevalent. Hell, Pike won IFC's chapter of the year, and no one gives them any credit."
Frat,34was1,FixMeASammich,2,Tue May 5 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, our chapter won 3 at GAAP and nobody gave a damn. I'm pretty sure that at other schools, they would be very impressed with an award like that. Hillel has nothing to complain about (I'm jewish too), they have that nice location right on third street.   Even though we have a house, I think its trash that people shit on unhoused chapters at our school. I have friends in unhoused fraternities that are in no way different than friends that I have in housed chapters. People just need to wake the fuck up here."
Frat,34was1,Starving_Kids,1 point,Tue May 5 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, most people join the fraternity or sorority that they fit in the most at. I was anti-greek when I came to IU and I joined TKE when it had 15 guys and I liked all of them because they took me for who I was, as well as most of them holding that same anti-greek feeling. It wasn't a case of ""if you can't beat them, join them"", but let's get organized and try to change the system from the inside. I didn't come to IU to join a house but once I started talking to the guys, I felt that I had made 15 new best friends as well as the rest of the 20 guys in my pledge class. I feel that not having a house lets us recruit the guys we like more anyways, those who are looking for a brotherhood that lets them be a part of something bigger than themselves while still being themselves at the same time. I feel that most housed fraternities do that too, but I feel that its probably more common for you guys to have the guys who just want to party and fuck bitches to come around during rush, (not that we don't get those types of guys too)."
Frat,34was1,smaynar3,30,Tue May 5 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think that ""tiers"" are retarded. I didn't join my house because they're one of the best on campus, I joined because I fit there. The whole concept seems very tryhard to me."

Yeah some houses are more well known for having big events on campus and there's 3 or 4 that are very popular rush destinations, but I have friends in 8 or 9 houses and a lot of people are similar across the board. Hell, last semester we had a 4 way social with our house, Sigma Chi, Zeta, and AXiD. That was a blast because the Sig Chi's are similar to our brothers and the girls get along well. Tiers are bullshit and unless you do something to have the rest of Greek life on campus look down on you (rape allegations, hazing (above the norm), etc.) then everyone's pretty cool with everyone.  But that's just my campus at a mid sized NE school."

We don't live in our houses so ranking fraternities holds less weight. Since joining greek life, the only thing I can assume determines the tiers is the amount the dues cost. Girls acknowledge that and the hotter ones go for the fraternities with the higher dues, assuming they're the rich guys of the pack. Kinda fucked up but that's how it is."

Introducing yourself as a freshmore or as a sophomore labels you as a tryhard.  At some point during rush, you will need to advise the Rush Chair that you may only have three years on campus, rather than four - because that fact may influence your value to the fraternity.  Oh, and if you're smart enough and industrious enough to have a full academic year's worth of credit hours before you land on campus, why not go to a flagship college like Univ of Texas, rather than a lesser branch college?

At ASU, we work with the university to help put on events during freshman welcome week prior to the official rush week.

If the event is inside, it's catered with tables along the edges of the room, and each fraternity (there's less than 10 on campus) gives a 2-5 minute presentation to the rushees on who they are and what they're about.

Frat,34qtsc,Help4123,8,Mon May 4 21:59:16 2015 UTC,Really awesome. We have 2 with two different taps so it makes great for keg races (we have a very 50/50 beer allegiance split in the house). The kegerators themselves never break in a way that can't be fixed in 15 minutes with a wrench.   If you guys have a place behind the bar where they can be kept away from guests and brothers being too rowdy they're awesome. We have  ours hidden behind the bar and the corner of the basement. Otherwise people will fuck with the machines and that's bad.  CO2 can be a bit finicky but not bad once you learn it.  Be careful if brothers steal the kegs if they don't get finished. We've had that happen and we lost the deposit on the kegs which sucks.
Frat,34qtsc,SamsDesigns,3,Sun May 3 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the detail, did you purchase or build them? We have some DIY guys that would be all about it, but I'm concerned about quality.

Ability to call some bad ass alumni your brothers. Access to national resources like conventions, district leaders, and other chapters for support. Gain more recognition for your letters since people will likely have had some exposure to brothers of whichever national fraternity you choose to initiate you all.

Frat,34o4eg,aew360,9,Sun May 3 00:03:44 2015 UTC,"You certainly gain a sense of legitimacy because you aren't just a local club but part of a larger network with certain standards and traditions.  You get access to resources (leadership development workshops, scholarships, recruitment or programming help).   Probably the coolest part is being part of a network with people across the nation. I've had brothers get stuck in a city in a different state. One call to the nearest chapter president and he had a place to crash until he managed to work out his transportation back home. We have alumni from other chapters who move to our town after graduating and they have essentially an automatic group of friends waiting for them. We've hosted numerous brothers visiting from other chapters when they stop through, and they host us when we're in town for a music festival or whatever.   It sounds sort of cliche, but it's sort of mind blowing how brothers you've never met before will be so welcoming and helpful when you're new in town or whatever.  There's a common set of values that bind all members of a national fraternity together. It's something that's not quite tangible but also immensely valuable."

They have two cameras on the corners of the mosque pointed at our front and side yard and one in a window pointed towards our house in general.   So when they have service, some of them will park in our lot, despite the many signs saying Sigma Pi Parking only. So we'll immediately call our towing guys, who are super quick to show up and put it on a lift. I had one guy try to say I'm discriminating him for doing it, which is ridiculous. I pointed to the sign and he just got all pissed and went back inside.   They would always try to avoid eye contact or shoot us dirty looks.

Frat,34k9fi,BigAbbott,2,Mon May 4 10:37:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I just contacted Kyle.   Essentially our house got hit by social probation which caused a lot of issues; we had limited parties and outreach to new potentials and rushes became shittier. Older brothers watched the house become less ""cool"" (which is true, we have some fucks in our house. rush chairs fucked up). And now the probation is gone, but any members from before the crisis are gone as well and all that remains is the apathy and the attitude that our house isn't cool anymore.  Some lazy shits don't want to do anything anymore and just sit in their room smoking weed talking shit on the rest of the house. They and other brothers strategically leave the house just before chapter meeting, and we have trouble reaching quorum, which is truly a joke. It's fucking painful, and knowing the potential of our house and brothers and seeing it fall so fruitlessly short make me almost regret joining this goddamn house. We're trying to turn it around by eradicating the more, uh, toxic(?) members of our house and rushing hard.   But my original question is also something I know will dramatically change our members' attitudes toward the house. If we just get one or two things to give our parties and edge, they will become infinitely better, and everyone who comes will have a better time. Our bros will start caring like they used to, and girls will want to come to our house if they hear from their friends that we're actually fun again instead of some lame fucks who throw just another frat party.   Sorry for the rant, I'm just obviously a bit frustrated. I really appreciate your advice, and hope that Kyle can help us out."

Always played at a park that had beer at the concession stands, so it was a pretty fun time even if you suck at softball.

Greek life here is really great, the whole school doesn't hate us, and sometimes even likes us.  While we (greek life) isn't the majority of students, we defiantly are the student leaders of campus.  In regards to Oregon, from what I've seen and heard greek life there, isn't bad, but it's defiantly not as good as Oregon State.

The last one actually helps a lot more than you would think. It lets people have nonsense, so we get less useless emails, because they can just put the funny part at the bottom of a serious email.

You have to ask yourself whether 18-22 year olds can offer you much in the way of personal growth and development, and you may find the relationship more like having a house full of younger brothers whose backs you have to watch - rather than the more egalitarian - we're all in this together - experience you had though Basic and with your unit in the Corps.  Be sure you emphasize to the Chapter President and the Pledgemaster that as a Marine, your FIRST obligation is to your Country's service, and then second to the fraternity - and that any conflicts must be resolved in the Corps' favor - that won't be a problem as long as it's disclosed up front.  Thanks for your service. I hope you decide to pledge - it will be fun for you and it will be good - very good - for the Chapter.

You can do some great pulled pork, buffalo chicken, chili, mac and cheese, all sorts of stuff. Other than that, there's a fair amount of things you can do on a stove with a cast iron skillet. If you have a butcher shop in the area, they'll typically have weekly or daily specials on certain cuts of meat. Sometimes steaks get discounted, sometimes its roasts, it changes. But you buy things that are at a discount, get a couple of them too. Steak can be great if its cooked right in a hot cast iron skillet. Other than that sort of stuff, Costco/BJs/Sam's club can be your best friend. Buy frozen chicken in bulk, and then put them in smaller bags.   Also, if you're close to a RestaurantDepot, that can be pretty great, especially if you want to cook for a larger group of people."

Frat,348wcn,TDenverFan,5,Wed Apr 29 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"2-3k attendees is a LOT. In the past 3 years, we've hosted Juicy J, Kap Slap, Crizzly, Driicky Graham, MIMS, Dorrough, RiFF RAFF, 3LAU, Mickey Avalon, and maybe a few more I'm not remembering. We hit capacity at less than 1,000 people.   First thing you're gonna need is a stage. Either build one or rent a professional one for a couple hundred bucks. Renting a sound system for a crowd that big is easily gonna run you $500. Expect a security deposit of up to a grand, and if you have to supply DJ gear, expect a security deposit of up to 5-6k. If that budget is for just the artist, you'll be best off booking an older rap artist who's gone a bit by the wayside. Someone that's no longer on the charts, but students will remember from when they were younger. If that budget is for the whole event, you're gonna be tight-strapped for cash. I believe we were able to throw an entire build party, including alcohol, featuring Mickey Avalon (the My Dick guy) for 8k. Driicky was cheaper. Other artists ranged from 20k to 40k.   Basically, don't expect to turn a profit unless you can get a good deal on a good artist. I'm in charge of setting up for our events, PM me if you need advice or anything  Edit: Security is also a necessity with artists, most artist riders require adequate security. Our Juicy J concert went up in flames because the crowd outside our gate rioted and knocked down the fence. 30k wasted in an instant"

We finally got the right people to be in charge, we kicked out 14 people and we are moving forward in every aspect, it took us a whole year to surpass two fraternities to now be considered high bottom or low middle, not much but better.  That is neither here or there, the reason I am bringing this up is to show you that it will be tough, frustrating, and at points, not fun, but you will be a better person for it.  If you don't want to work, join an established fraternity, if you do, great, but know what you are getting into.  Recruiting:  Formal recruiting is not going to be your friend.  If you do not have a house, a house on fraternity row or an established/good reputation you will not get many from formal.  Also, do not spend all of your resources and time on ""5-star recruits"", 99% of the time they will go to the top houses.  Be honest with yourselves (like a MAC football school) and go after ""3-stars"" and ""4-stars"", they may have a flaw or two, but that might make them and your house unique or you can support that person to change for the better. My roommate who pledged with me was an emo and now he is a little more preppy, got rid of his dumb purple hair, but still is his own person.  Which brings me to my next point, most of your recruiting will and should be informal.  Look upon you and your brothers and see what you like the most about you and what makes you guys you, because at the end of the day it is still about brotherhood (one our cardinal principles).  This is gonna be a pain in the ass, because you and your brothers should be constantly active everywhere on campus meeting new people, and when I mean everywhere, I mean everywhere (REC, Cafes, IM fields, etc.).  This will be easier to do in the beginning of the new school year, because you can go to random freshmen in Cafes and dorms and just talk to them and they will just think ""hey, this is college"".  What we like to do is group up in pairs, a person who is an opener (able to strike up a convo easily with randos) and a closer (who can get the contact info and invite them out, etc.).  You should be constantly on the lookout for cool guys (classrooms, library, rec), especially if you already know someone its easier for you and him to become friends.  NOTE: Do not wear your letters when talking to these people (unless very subtly), do not bring up fraternity (you will seem like a vacuum salesman), just make them your friend and later on introduce them to your ""friends"" (brothers) and go on from there.  Have every brother essentially sponsor one person in the year and it will help you grow with good guys (doesn't mean you have to initate them all).  Some people might say this will bring in goobers...perhaps, but that is why you get to know them first before you bid them and why we also still have a pledge process.  Fuck what nationals wants you to do when it comes to recruiting, you would rather have 7 quality guys then 22 goobers.    I cannot stress enough how much you will have to work with everything to get established, you will literally be working to the bone to set up community service/philanthropy events, successful social events, greek relations and recruting, because that last one is a 24/7 job that all brothers need to help with, honestly all of it will be a 24/7 job. You plant the seeds now, so that the future brothers may rest in your shadows. If you want more advice on anything PM, if not, whatevs.  Again this more of a buffet of advice, take what you want.

Frat,341yu4,foodandnaps,3,Tue Apr 28 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"First off, just make sure everyone knows what a roast is so they don't get butthurt. Maybe get everyone to watch a roast so they know what's up. We had one guy that kept talking back to the roasters when he was joked about, and we had to let him know that getting shit on is part of it and that he was being a bitch by interrupting. That was really the only annoying part of the whole thing.  After explaining what it is to everyone, I would just simply assign someone to be the roast master, and he will pick who is getting roasted and who the roasters are (maybe no more than 5-6 roasters). The roast master needs to be able to run the roast and keep control of the crowd, as well as pick some decent people to participate in the roast.  The roast master will set a date and time, or it may just happen at some point during a brotherhood retreat like ours did. Be sure to talk it up like a week or two in advance so it's something that the rest of the guys are dying to watch. Then just find a good location to hold the roast and have fun with it!  tl;dr Find a brother that has the initiative to organize it. Set up is simple, just talk it up and make sure people know what a roast is so it doesn't fly off the handle half way through."

You could even just buy some used ones from your local goodwill if you want to go reall cheap.  As for the actual course, most guys that live in the house make a hole in their room, and then we have some up and down the stairs and some in the basement. Anything goes, guys get super creative and some are lazy, it all depends on how much you want to run with it.  We make it even more of a fun event by letting people use whatever they want as a putter. I used an umbrella last year.

Credit card companies charge that to anyone using their service, they don't do their job for free.  From what I've found, Square is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to accept credit card payments.  Also, I'd look in to how much Omega Fi is actually charging you.  My past treasurer thought that they only charged us a flat rate of $1,500 per semester.  It turned out that they were actually charging us 8.9%, plus an additional fee for credit cards, so around 10% on most dues.  We're currently switching to Greek Capital Management, which only charges us $25 per brother."
Frat,343fcp,samhudson333,9,Tue Apr 28 00:36:07 2015 UTC,Holy cow thats a high percentage. Omegafi charges us 2.65% and were about to switch to legacy financial. Loads cheaper.

You all still get them when you open a bank account. They don't cost anything to use for either party (providing the money is there). The bank usually prints check images on the statements of the people who sent them (so they know they were cashed and when). They're very difficult to steal or have info hacked/lost.  Use checks.

Frat,342ha0,ChoPT,21,Mon Apr 27 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"The odds of you being able to get insurance with enough coverage to satisfy the school at a cost that you could afford are incredibly low.  The odds of your school wanting to recognize a local organization, unless they already do, are incredibly low.  Looking at Phi Kap's national website, I see your fees and dues as follow:  New member fees: $375 total (just pledging semester)  Annual Membership Dues: $155 per member (counting assessment and national dues)  Chapter Assessment Fee: $375/members in chapter  Insurance: Variable. Based on Wikipedia saying you have 46 active chapters, I'm going to estimate high and say your insurance comes in at around $250/man.  All of that adds up to $405 plus the per man percentage of your national assessment. Let's just say you have a 15 man chapter so it becomes $25.  Your annual fees to nationals now total $430.   Your pledge fees should be straight in and out.   Just to pay for nationals your dues need to be $215/semester. We've seen the dues question countless times on this sub, and I've worked with too many chapters to count without ever seeing dues as low as $215/semester.  How much are your dues? Honestly it sounds like your chapter just has bad financial management."

The fraternity members acted shamefully and brought disgrace on their letters and their college - but they do not deserve to be put in physical danger.  They are already being dealt with more severely than similar behavior would be punished in the military or veterans' organizations.

If the chapter really must have a spokesman on this, then appoint one and only one person - usually the President or Risk Manager to do ALL the talking - and talk as little as possible.  Express concern first for the guys your brother assaulted, then express concern for your brother, mentioning that deep family losses have affected him recently.  Don't say he's a good guy.  Getting him in AA right now, before the questions arise, is a great idea from /u/snowmanvl .   I usually agree with /u/JohnOBrosley, but this time I think is different.  The legal case will likely be pled out with community service as long as no one was injured and this was a first offense. If this happened on campus, he may have more trouble with the college than with the courts.  Having a brotherhood is not just about when things are going well - brothers should be able to count on brothers even when they do wrong - as long as they are willing to make amends and improve.

Frat,33zxvm,heyamipeeing,2,Mon Apr 27 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"Congrats man - you will be remembered in stories your Pledges tell for generations.  Remember the purpose of pledging is two fold - 1. To learn about the fraternity, the chapter, and the brothers.  2. To challenge the pledge class in order to create a bond between the Pledge Brothers as they struggle to overcome difficult crucible challenges - a bond that easily transfers to the Chapter as a whole at Initiation.  To create the Bond, the challenges must be solvable, winnable - as a group.  Any challenge where the Pledges always lose is just torture devoid of lesson.  Make all your activities purposeful, with a lesson to be learned.  If you cannot get away with physical stress and endurance activities like morning Pledge runs, consider trying to send Pledges to a GoRuck or a ToughMudder event, with the Actives cheering them on.  Carefully review any ""traditional"" activities your chapter has ""always"" used to make sure you understand the lesson being taught, and to make sure that lesson can be safely taught by that activity.  Get a breathalyzer for the house, and never, ever, ever leave a blacked out Pledge alone to ""sleep it off.""   Stress the privacy of the Chapter - emphasize that Pledges will never be entrusted with the ritual secrets of the fraternity if they cannot be trusted with the ordinary activities of the House.  That means they do not talk with roommates, parents, girlfriends, classmates, pledges from other fraternities, Twitter, FaceBook, Instagram, or any of the rest about what goes on inside the House.  To be valuable to them as future Brothers, the privacy of the House must be sacrosanct.  Lastly, try to give potential rushees who contact the Recruitment Chair over the summer some solid advice on preparing for college and preparing to pledge - everything from study tips to conditioning & nutrition advice."

Just pick the one with the best extracurriculars, and if you aren't doing any extracurriculars, just go with what's cheapest."
Frat,33ujey,frattynuts,2,Sun Apr 26 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"FSU. There's no question. They are both big well known public universities, your degree coming from UF won't mean much more at all. But the experience you will get at FSU vs UF can't be measured.   The greek life is better, I was in a sorority while there. Just don't become a tool after haha.   And if you're majoring in an art, fsu is 100% the place to be over uf. They both have their strengths and the arts is Fsu's territory."

As someone who grew up in Florida and was looking at the two of them, I also felt like I clicked at FSU more. That being said, both schools are great and when it comes down to it UF is a better school academically. I am a bit iffy with you being accepted as a theatre major and I think you should try and change that as soon as possible. It's a bad idea to go into a school solely on a different major because the acceptance requirements were lower.   FSU has a great social life for all the students as does UF, you'll be happy wherever you go and make new friends at either school."

Now, college is more focused on preparing you to support yourself in a challenging, rewarding, and productive career.  There is (and always has been) a difference between vocation and avocation.  Can you really support yourself after college ANYWHERE except New York or London as a technical theatre major?  Study theatre in college, but also try to prepare yourself to support yourself and your future family.  That said, UF is a cut above FSU academically - higher standards, smarter students, more challenging work.  Always choose the most challenging option - the option most likely to make you rise to become truly better.  If you choose UF and are required to major in theatre, take lots of focused courses in another discipline so you can support yourself.  Greek life is great on both campuses."

But someone made a pretty good point earlier about the sheer size of the resort they were staying on. It holds over 3000 people and only about 60 were UF ZBTs. One of them came forward and said everything was blown out of proportion. He said the accusations of them throwing bottles from the balcony is complete bullshit, because apparently they had only bought canned beer since glass bottles aren't allowed at the beach. There was also a lot of animosity between the wives of veterans and the half naked dates because apparently they were flirting with the vets when they found out they served America.   I'm not trying to defend them for getting too drunk, but all of these accusations seem to hollow. Much like the Miami SAEs destroying an entire lake house. I think something wrong happened, but I'm not buying the story that they were terrorizing these heroes. We're one of the most patriotic demographics in America. Also, why didn't anyone take pictures of them doing this shit? Don't they have smart phones?

It is likely that somethings are exaggerated but I also don't doubt that fraternity brothers could have in some way been antagonizing or exacerbating the situation.  Get a few beers in us and we can do some stupid things.  I've been there too.  The thing people need to remember though is it's one thing to have fun in your house but it's completely different to have fun on vacation somewhere.  Once you leave the house you're in the public's eye and fraternities already have a bad name with the general populace so every little thing we do gets scrutinized.

No more registering parties because they are just a bunch of guys with a big house and a love for alcohol. No more probation because fuck you. No more weekly chapter meetings, no more dues payments to Nationals, no more scholarship chair making you study.   More money, less commitment. More freedom, less oversight. I agree.

Great dog but it's always gotta have something in his mouth so if your dirty fucks who don't pick your trash up that's fine but if your pledges are stupid fucks that don't pick your trash up then a retriever might not be the best choice  2) we don't have a house mom/dad so one brother bought the dog and is the ""owner"". But most brothers will take him out and take care of him.  3) ours is a guy, if you plan on initiating the dog I'd  advise a boy.   4) pure breeds are obviously more expensive but look better and are maybe easier to train.

Frat,33nbfy,RobinIsAGoodfellow,14,Fri Apr 24 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"Labs and Golden Retrievers seem to have the best, loving, mellow temperament to fit well in a fraternity house.  The short haired labrador may be easier to groom than a long haired Golden who may roll in spilled beer (or worse).  Yellow labs seem less threatening to outsiders than chocolate or black labs and yellows may pull more as puppies and as adults.  Malinois and German Shepherd Dogs are the smartest, but both may be too aggressive for a fraternity house, and both usually bond strongly to a single primary master - not to a large group of guys.  Small dogs are too physically fragile for a fraternity.  Get a puppy so that the pup accepts the chaos and noise of a fraternity house as normal, but make sure the dog has a large crate in an always quiet spot in the House - usually in the primary owner's room - and that the dog can always get to that crate if the dog needs to get away for some quiet.      Having one freshman brother be the dog's primary owner is a good idea, even if the chapter fronts the purchase cost and training costs and upkeep cost - so one person has decisive authority over what's ok for the dog and what is not.  That primary owner should have owned dogs before, and the dog's crate should be in that brother's always-open room.  When that freshman brother graduates, a new freshman buys a new puppy and the cycle repeats.  Do not get the dog while the freshman primary owner is a pledge - you do NOT want the dog seeing his master abused by brothers - that would trigger the dog's defense of his pack.  Dogs remember.  Get a certified purebred puppy from the best breeder ($500-$1000) - that's the only way of ruling out genetic diseases that would shorten the dog's life and cause the dog pain.    Consider investing the $1K-$3K to have the puppy professionally trained, and then have the trainer spend a session or two with the brothers to review the training the dog has received.    Get males neutered.  You'll need to assure your insurance covers the dog potentially biting someone - all dogs will bite if abused, but legally it's always the dog's owner's fault.  If the House insurance does not cover the dog, then make sure the primary owner's insurance does.  Get a GPS tracker collar if the dog wonders so you can find him, like Iota or Tagg.  Or install an Invisible Fence to keep the dog on House property.  http://www.techhive.com/article/2459455/iota-offers-no-fee-gps-tracking-thanks-to-long-range-rf-and-your-neighbors-wi-fi.html   http://www.techhive.com/article/240632/tagg_keeps_your_pets_safe_with_gps_and_mobile_technology.html   http://www.invisiblefence.com/   You may need to carpet stairways and landings - puppies and young dogs slip easily on smooth surfaces and can tumble down.  Get a GoPro Fetch harness for the dog and create the best party videos in Chapter history.  http://shop.gopro.com/mounts/fetch-dog-harness/ADOGM-001.html#/start=1   Lastly, you'll need to educate your brothers on the weird foods that are absolutely poisonous to dogs - alcohol leading the list:  alcohol, chocolate, onions, avocado and guacamole, bread dough or cookie dough, grapes or raisins, macadamia nuts:  https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/foods-are-hazardous-dogs   Chapter dog - best brother in the House"

Don't have a 'house dog' because then there's issues of who takes care of it over break, whose room it sleeps in, who feeds it, etc. Let the issue of where the brother gets it from, age, gender, etc. be up to him.   Also make the sure the dog is sturdy enough that it can't be accidentally hurt if they get tripped over or something falls on them. Beagles and cockers are pretty small and Bassets have really fragile spines, so nix those breeds."

I think something like that would be worth a road trip since I've personally driven across to Michigan from the carolinas to find the perfect fit for me.  I'm not sure whether your house is used for parties or not but keep that in mind when you're getting a dog. Make sure you have a safe environment for the dog to be in and that someone doesn't mind it being there if you do have parties since you don't want Fido getting into any trouble.

It will be interesting to see how UF frames whatever action they try to take - most State Universities seem to overreach their US Constitutional authority - as when OU expelled the two idiots for racist speech., and when (as cited by another poster here), UF disciplined a fraternity man for hate speech.  But, as I said, these buffoons are not beyond the reach of accountability.  Their Chapter and/or their Nationals can discipline or expel them.

Frat,33kadi,Artystrong1,19,Thu Apr 23 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. There's definitely two sides to every story and Mrs. Cope may have been throwing out allegations because she doesn't like fraternities. Typical rowdy behavior may have occurred but ripping American flags off vehicles and pissing on them? Come on now. Especially from a southern fraternity where patriotism runs deep and the respect for military is huge. Hell, look at the patriots on this subreddit even, there's tons of us. Do you really think a fraternity in the deep south would specifically target veterans and ruin their day? And if this really happened why weren't the police involved or ZBT kicked out of the resort? Bottles being thrown, and property being stolen and damaged seems like good enough reason to me.  These articles aren't based on fact but rather on ""anonymous social media reports"" and the claims of a few angry people including an old woman and two veterans featured in the video. Now I have the utmost respect for veterans and believe that 90% of them are genuine great people and I do think they should be treated with respect. However there is a small percentage of SJWs in uniform who are narcissistic and feel that their feet should be kissed and the ground they walk on should be worshiped because they served in the forces. Take the guy from the video for example, he literally says ""We've made such a sacrifice for this country, they need to learn what its like on the other side."" Yes it's true they do make great sacrifices for our freedom. However, going around saying how much of a sacrifice you made and how much respect you deserve seems very narcissistic in a way to me. Maybe the guy was offended because the guys were being loud while he was trying to have a peaceful vacation, or maybe it was as simple as a fraternity brother didn't come up and shake his hand and thank him or something, who knows? But if they were stealing his shit and pissing on it I doubt the only course of action he would take would be complaining about it on the news.  Really bad journalism, reminds me of the rolling stone incident in a way.  And these guys are gonna get some nasty backlash from this too without being able to give their side of things just like UVA did. You guys are quick to defend fraternities normally. I think the fact that veterans are on the other side of the coin makes everyone react a bit differently, which is good. It shows that we fraternity men respect our veterans, which brings me again to my point of: why would a group of fraternity men target veterans on vacation? Now if these guys actually did all these things, then fuck them. They deserve everything that is coming to them. But right now, I think everyone should wait for more facts to come out before we crucify these guys."

I was completely unaware of a horrible thing that affects millions of people daily, I'm so glad you brought it to my attention.""

Maybe I'm in my ignorant conservative bubble, but I can't believe some of the stuff that these people get approved by the masses.  take for example what happened at Arizona State. Their annual undie run, which raises tons and tons of clothes that are donated to charities like Goodwill and Salvation army, had their funds dis-appropriated and instead moved to the construction of, and i shit you not, the construction of gender-neutral bathrooms and housing.

Perhaps a bit like what the Tea Party is to libertarianism.   The best way to deal with these types of people is to learn a bit about the philosophies behind their ideology- they often conflict with one another. For example, the question about who is 'qualified' to speak/act on sexual assault issues can get ugly the deeper you go. If only those who have experienced sexual harrasment/ assault are (which I'm assuming is her position) then does that mean everyone who wants to help must first qualify themselves by disclosing their victimization to the public? Certainly doesn't sound so good when you word it that way.

Frat,33fmcj,SmallTownIowa,28,Wed Apr 22 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  My fraternity had this amazing amount of apathy.  We had a couple large pledge classes, doing great, getting sororities to do functions with us, but one year we shat our beds.  Let's say we had single digit pledge classes.  All of a sudden, we just didn't care.  Along came a brother, he was an amazing recruitment chair, and another brother who was an amazing president and turned my fraternity around.  We recruited the guys and our president showed the necessary leadership, but in my opinion, that was only 2/3rds of how we became less apathetic.    The icing on the cake was our idea to make our pledgeship harder.  Prior, we had a tough pledgeship, but we decided to take our pledgeship to the next level.  Our new rigorous process made those benchwarmers in a PC into people that wanted to be in every single part of the fraternity.    To me, having a very difficult pledgeship taught our pledges to never take my letters for granted.  In our early years of implementing this process, we had some drops, and man, it sucks.  You see guys you like just up and leave.  I would never change it knowing what I know now.  Those guys were benchwarmers who were content on staying JV for their whole career.  My fraternity is strong now.  Whether you agree with pledgeship, hazing, etc. is your own opinion, but from my anecdotal experience, hard hazing brings out the guys that will come to events even if said events don't have a fine associated with them for absents."
Frat,33fmcj,FratThrowaway696969,8,Wed Apr 22 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"to be honest, I agree, even though it's strictly against our national policy and founding values. I don't think hazing should have to be a thing, but it's kind of shitty when it seems like beating values into people is the only way to get them to understand. We kicked a pledge trainer out for hazing, and he definitely hazed the shit out of them, but that pledge class is one of the strongest we've had in terms of participation, attendance, and overall membership. Nationals can preach all they want, but having people take quizzes on chapter history once a week isn't going to build strong values, and most high school freshman aren't going to take a fine or an essay as a serious punishment.

Be someone people believe in, that people want to follow. It won't be easy, and change will be slow. It can be done though.  Be serious about improving your chapter. Not sure about the size of your chapter, but if at all possible, have yourself/other exec/the president meet with every single brother you can. Talk with them about why they aren't interested in coming out to shit. Ask them if they want to see things change, find out if they are dissatisfied with anything this year/past years that made them loose interest.  Talking with people won't be easy - you have to balance being assertive (ie. making it clear that you're expecting them to take the conversation seriously) with being brotherly. You'll have to balance your ideas about that chapter and theirs - sometimes you'll have diverging or completely different opinions. This is OK. Emphasize being diplomatic, but don't let your brothers push you around by calling you a boner or whatever - it's your job to do things like this, and it's their job to poke fun at you for being serious. Don't let it get to you.  Your ultimate goal should be to change the chapter culture to one that incorporates as much good that currently exists (ie. pledgeing traditions that work, chapter events that are good, etc) to one that both works hard and plays hard. Have the culture expect people to be leaders and good men that are motivated and uphold the values of your letters - whatever they are. Have the culture expect attendance at every event without a good excuse, attendance and participation at chapter, participation in events that you attend. People should feel obligated to do things that result in good things for your chapter - each and everyone of your member's actions reflects on the whole chapter.   It looks like other people here have some pretty good things to say as well, so I won't go on further - lots of what I would say would be re-iterating what they say."

I'd say 70% of our rush list knows a brother coming in some form or fashion, but that isn't a prerequisite. A ""typical no go"" is usually a kid who is viewed as awkward socially, disrespectful to a brother or girl at a rush party, dishonest or skeevy looking. Some major red flags are bad reports from girls, acting like a jackass on Twitter/Facebook, and at the risk of sounding like a try hard looking like a guido fag. You don't have to wear Brooks Brothers everything, and in fact going too far that direction can hurt you too, but look presentable. We usually don't get many kids who have that problem showing up but when they do it is a red flag. Also if you seem like a grades risk that is also a problem, usually that pertains more to sophomores going through rush.

Frat,33fkza,CBJ17,8,Wed Apr 22 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"In our view at my chapter, fraternities are supposed to be selective. Our chapter traditionally (at least for the past few years) has been quite successful too, so with large rush numbers we need to be selective. We never go in to a recruitment with a set quota or minimums or maximums - therefore, we can usually bid those that we feel deserve it but the recruitment team will always have a soft maximum and approach things that way. At our school, we can't restrict who comes to our open recruitment events, so we'll see hundreds. We have to cut down. There's so many that would never make a good fit, and there's many that likely would just fit somewhere else.   We also do a lot of member referrals, so typically by the time we reach official rush period we probably have 70-80% of our pledge class in mind. Rush just solidifies that or allows us to grab a few more dope kids. I think it's all really campus and chapter dependent. 60% might work for you, but that would be disastrous for us. Way too big and full of way too many useless members.   Chapter usually creates an informal list of preferred bids or solid bids. Recruitment team whittles that down further behind closed doors. Rest are invited back. Whittled down again. Final rush event. Whittled down. Bids. We typically go from about 300 to 60ish to 50ish to 25-35 bids.   Idk why I typed so much for this question..."

Frat,33fkza,CBJ17,5,Wed Apr 22 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"I go to a big ten school, lots of kids come through, we bid the ones who make a good impression on a brother. So if one or two brothers like him (or don't like him) he's bidded (or dinged)."
Frat,33fkza,OwenLincolnFratter,5,Wed Apr 22 12:35:11 2015 UTC,"UVA has a formal rush system, so it works a little differently. We have about 600 guys come through open house, then we narrow it down to 225 for first round, 100 for second round, 40 for third round. We end up giving bids to about 22/23 guys. 22/600=3.66%. There's about 35 kids who make it through the entire process and pick as their first choice for a house, so 22/35=62.86% for the last group.  It sounds pretty selective, but what you have to keep in mind is that these guys are looking at anywhere from 10 to 25 other houses probably. The process is mutually selective like informal rush at other schools, so the percentage for the number of kids who get bids from us and have us as their first choice is probably a lot higher.  I'm always intrigued to look at how rush at other schools works because it's so different at UVA, it actually sounds a lot more like sorority rush. But I think the system is good in that it actually helps guys end up where they fit best, and you can really tell the difference."

I hate buying cases now, kegs work so more efficiently. 1 full can or half a cup from a keg? I've seen a lot more risk this semester because of that..."
Frat,33fkza,GoWahoos,3,Thu Apr 23 05:31:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty split about a lot of the policies, but I do think the closed container policy is a good measure. You're saying people are drinking more because they're getting cans over half-filled cups from a keg? I can see some of the logic behind that. Sure, people are getting less drinks with a keg because they'll have to make more trips to a crowded bar, but I don't think everyone is going to be absolutely hammered as a result of having easier access to a couple of beer cans over cups from a keg. Having cases with cans makes it easier for the people serving to realize how many drinks they've been serving though.  I think the closed container policy is good for party-goers, they have a sense they're getting a drink that hasn't been altered at all and they're able to count how many drinks they've had more easily. If any of the policies stick around, I think that policy is probably going to one of the first.  Discloser: I am a part of IFC Risk Management committee and I'm risk manager for my chapter, so I have some hands on experience with all the policies."
Frat,33fkza,MischiefSupreme,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:09:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with your viewpoint too, but I like to argue that the wait it takes will be the same, so they're effectively getting more alcohol in the same timespan.   I know the argument for altered drinks being possibly served is a very serious argument and one that I agree with, but there have got to be better ways to protect against that. Has that even happened at UVA? Although I don't believe anyone in ANY chapter would do it, you always have to watch out for the randos that always show up.... I can see having a can as a harder way to slip it in but then again girls mostly drink boxed wine at parties (that is served in a solo up).  And I legitimately thought you were from my chapter judging from the rush statistics you states until I realized that our risk manager isn't in an IFC position hahah"

Since we do summer rush as well, we come into the fall rush with a few guys already kinda assumed to be in our pledge class.    Last fall, we had roughly 200 (give or take) guys come to our various events.  The rush chairs took out the obvious no's so there were probably around 80ish guys on the ppt for voting, of which we gave 24 bids.  19 of them accepted + 4 guys from the summer for a pledge class of 23.  This spring I know for a fact we had 82 people on the rush list.  There were probably around 30 on the ppt and we gave out 15 bids of which 12 were accepted."

If your numbers are anything less than 8-10 for each, just know you will be relegated to bottom-tier for life. I kid, I kid, but really if you want to get into a good fraternity, it's really not that hard. I've found out this one simple trick that everyone that has made it into our upper-mid/top tier fraternity has done:    All you have to do is be more confident than you normally would. Men respect confidence, the more confident you are the better. I would walk up to the biggest, frit-frattiest guy there and stare him down. Slowly walk up to him, silently, making constant eye contact until you are about 6 inches from his face. Assuredly he will try to back away, as he realizes the pure level of confratence you are exuding. Don't let him do this! Without responding to the ""get the fuck out of my face"" that he will be repeating, close in and give him a frat kiss on the cheek, a Friss if you will. Now this might seem weird, but remember, you don't know anything about greek life yet. Once you're in, you'll realize that was the least homoerotic thing you will have to do. The ""Friss"" is a symbol that is passed down from fathers to sons in order to get them an insta-bid. You do want a bid right?    Anyway, to sum it up, here are my tips to success:  1.) Confidence. 2.) The Friss. 3.) Bring coke. yes cocaine 4.) Find out who the actives girlfriends are, and Facebook them pics of your soon to be frock.    Happy Fratting my future fratter"

Week 1: one of the most important parts of being a frat star is the sperry stank (yeah, i called em sperrys and not frat cleats. #tftc) you're gonna build a respectable stank by running a mile in them three times a week.  however, in order to work on the dad bod gainz (it's totally in right now.  look it up, brosef) you need to up your caloric intake to offset the calories burned in running.  ergo (that's latin for 'therefore,' bro beans) you're gonna drink a case of fratty light after every mile.  another major part of being a total frat star is alcohol tolerance.  everybody knows that actually drinking alcohol is totally NF (it stands for 'not frat,' lil broski.  acronyms, FAF [frat as fuck]), so you're gonna butt chug it.  Week 2: every frat star who's anybody has been hazed.  pretty severely, but they totally deserved it for being part of the worst pledge class ever.  whatever.  so we're gonna get you on a hazing regime via skype.  my username is slamminbrewspoppinpussyandhazinballs, so add me on that, and we'll get some distance learning shit going.  in addition to what you're doing right now.  Weeks 3-6: same thing as above, but i'll ramp it up for you.  i don't want to ruin the suprise, marco brolo.  week 7: now that you know what it's like to have your balls literally hazed off, i'm gonna teach you (via skype) how to do it.  this is where those kids come in.  i didn't mention it before, but you're also gonna need some biscuits and a tub of lube.  week 8: the best part about being a total frat star is slaying the puss (it's synechdoche; coming out of nowhere with the knowledge bombs, brobi one kenobi).  what you're gonna do now is start fuckin em all day everyday.  you gotta keep the slam pieces in a constant rotation.  i usually give a pledge a planner and a cell phone so that he can coordinate them.  just get your little brother to help.  did i say you needed condoms? no way brosé.  if you don't rawdog it, you might as well be a geed (it's slang for GDI which is an acronym for goddamn independent).    that's what i got for you little vincent van brogh.  hit me up on skype when you're ready to begin your training."

Frat,33drct,fresh_kicks,46,Tue Apr 21 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"I think the largest effect that comes from not having a house is cliques within the chapter. As is natural, you become close with your roommates and not as much with people you don't live with. It is a serious problem at our chapter. So try to avoid that as much as possible.  Other than that, things aren't too difficult, we have to rent out a private locked room for chapter, from the community college in town, as our university doesn't provide such resources.  (Almost) all of our events take place on campus.  Houses are a huge risk/expenditure as well so our dues are only around 400$, I know that housing is one of the biggest expenses at other chapters, where dues are around 5 grand."

Sure, we use a room in the student center for chapter, but we have a house off campus where some of the guys live, and we do things there. It's a small town, so nothing's too far from anything, I can walk there, it's all good. I wouldn't say there are really any cliques in our chapter, but then again, 16 guys.

We live all over the city, but have one house we call ""The House"" and it's where we party, gather for events, plan stuff, build, host rush events, and we call it home in general.

One fraternity has an actual house, and a few live in penthouses (massive dorms that can live 12-15 people) in student housing -- but these come with an RA so it's not like they can throw ragers there or anything.   The biggest challenge without a house is finding space to do things, which seems obvious but has a huge impact on our operations. Want to get everyone together for dinner? Make a reservation at a restaurant. Want to meet weekly for chapter? Reserve a space in a semi-public room from the school. Want to have pledge education meetings? Reserve a study room in the library. Want to hold rush events? Reserve more space. Want to hold initiation or ritual in a secure environment? Rent a room somewhere you know prying eyes and ears won't be an issue. Want to host a mixer? Most apartments can't hold 40+ people, so you need to rent out an entire bar.   If we had a house we could do all that and more there without worrying about staying over our allotted time or being walked in upon when discussing secrets. Space in this city (NYC) is relatively scarce as it is, and having everyone so spread out means putting even simple events together can become a logistical nightmare.  At the end of the day we still do what we need to do and have fun doing it, but if we have a communal space -- man, chapter life would be so, so much simpler to organize."

Frat,33drct,FlyPengwin,2,Tue Apr 21 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"Our school used to have houses (20 years ago).  We usually end up renting 2-3 houses in town that are designated party houses.  We try to keep one house for as long as possible if its a really nice party house.  I know that one fraternity actually had an alumni buy a huge house and rent it out to the brothers that live there, so they pretty much had a chapter house that wasn't recognized by nationals.  The biggest problem is that there is no centralized position for everyone to meet at"
Frat,33drct,k_sully33,2,Tue Apr 21 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"We don't have on campus housing and the houses near our school are expensive, so most everyone is in apartments. Like a lot of guys here have said, they're less susceptible to randoms and police, and they're definitely less expensive than a house. The bad side to this is that our chapter seems to have less of a ""stomping ground,"" and chapter is held in reserved rooms on campus. The sophomores live in greek-only dorms that are co-ed and floors are split between organizations, and it makes it easy to build relations with guys from other chapters as the people living next to you are usually in a different org.  The biggest difference that people are forgetting is rush. Rush is a pain in the ass without owning any property, and we have to resort to booking restaurant and university spaces for rush events, which are usually pretty regulated (no bars and rushees have to be registered.) and turns into a competition between fraternities for whoever can book the coolest event ($$$) and market the shit out of it to new guys. If anyone is wondering our chapters range from 100ish to 60 members."
Frat,33drct,bacon-overlord,2,Tue Apr 21 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"My Chapter doesn't have a big house, but we have a few rented houses. We usually try to all rent on one street or within a close area, but it doesn't always work out. We have 45 guys in our chapter, so we have about 4 or 5 houses rented out. The usual problems are with parties. Neighbors can be huge assholes, and call cops on us, but usually the cops are pretty chill the first time they are called, as long as they see the party is under control. If they get called back though, they'll shut it down or threaten a noise violation. Our saving grace is that we have so many rented houses, meaning we really only have to rage at each house once or twice a month. This way the cops don't get too pissed at any one house in particular. For chapter we use a lecture hall on campus, and it works pretty well since we have guards and really no one is going to lecture halls on Sunday afternoons. Our dues are just north of $300."
Frat,33drct,bostonbio,2,Tue Apr 21 19:41:58 2015 UTC,At our school we have dorm style Greek life. Pretty much all the Fraternities and Sororities live together in dorms in separate wings. We have a few members off campus in houses and that's where you party
Frat,33drct,Manakel93,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"We just use campus classrooms for chapter and have a chest of the stuff we need that we drag around when we need to do ritual. Other than that, most of our parties are apartment parties, then people head to bars."
Frat,33drct,IHSV1855,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:20:42 2015 UTC,Storage for chapter property/ritual equipment is annoying. Rather than just being downstairs/out back it's in a storage unit halfway across town and you need to be one of the keyholders to get in.
Frat,33drct,brendintosh,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"My chapter doesn't even have what you described with brothers living in smaller houses. My school has a policy that makes it mandatory to live in the dorms all 4 years unless you have a medical excuse or are a commuter. We do have our own wing of a dorm though, so that lessens the shittiness a bit. It really does feel like our own space and we have our own chapter room and stuff instead of having to rent a room on campus like some chapters. The only real drawback is RAs and HDs breaking up parties, but at the same time we get free cleaning and maintenance work, so that's nice. All in all I really do wish we had a house but I think we have the best of a bad situation right now."
Frat,33drct,pwaves13,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:55:04 2015 UTC,There is a big difference also between the alumni owning your house and land it is built upon and the university owning your house and/or the land it is on. At our school the university owns our houses and will not let us move into our own so they basically have our balls in their hand. They also love nothing more than to squeeze them just to let us know they're still there.
Frat,33epi8,Impune,6,Tue Apr 21 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"We have a DFSL advisor who works for the school full-time and he's great. He's a younger guy who was Greek at another school so we can be very open with him about stuff we do. Our exec board has to meet with him once a semester and the meetings are actually really helpful for us. Plus, we figure having someone like that on our side could be useful if the shit ever hits the fan"
Frat,33epi8,jaykyew,3,Tue Apr 21 23:16:49 2015 UTC,We also have an advisor in the Fraternity & Sorority Life Office; there's one for IFC and one for Panhell/MGC. We meet with them once every other week and they are usually at the IGC general assemblies.  I agree that it's nice to have a younger administrator who was Greek during their undergraduate years as an advocate.
Frat,33epi8,BourbonAndFrisbee,5,Wed Apr 22 02:36:04 2015 UTC,"My chapter has a professor in the business school who serves as our faculty advisor. He's such a great tool for us. Any member who falls below a 2.5 GPA must meet with him once a month to discuss grade improvements, he knows who they are since he has access to Blackboard. He'll write letters of rec, help students navigate the complicated world of grade drops/changes, and help nudge other professors if they're taking too long to get back to someone. On more than one occasion he's helped a brother apply for academic grievance if their grades were dropping due to a family tragedy. He also attends our EC meeting to apply input."
Frat,33epi8,RobinIsAGoodfellow,3,Wed Apr 22 15:10:24 2015 UTC,"Because any faculty advisor is an employee of the university, he has fiduciary obligations to the university to look after the university's best interests.  Unless he was an alumni of the particular chapter he was advising (which I have never encountered), I would expect that while his wisdom and his ability to intercede with the Deans may be valuable, that he could never be brought fully into the confidence of the fraternity or its leadership.  I have seen faculty advisors used to design tutoring programs marshaling the resources of the college for brothers on the edge of academic probation, design or procure better alcohol awareness programs than available from Nationals, and my guess is that they might be useful in designing or procuring better sexual assault awareness programs and affirmative consent programs than Nationals.  I have also seen the faculty advisor involved in planning an annual reception for faculty on the Chapter lawn (not inside the House, and usually staged as a pregame tailgate with barbecue but no alcohol) each fall to try and boost the House's reputation with smiling well scrubbed Brothers (NOT pledges and not rushees - usually staged for the home game before bid day) in blazer and tie working the lawn amongst posters publicizing past and future philanthropy events and the fraternity's history and significant alumni."
Frat,33epi8,HurpaDurpDeeDurp,2,Wed Apr 22 02:17:24 2015 UTC,"My chapter's just getting started having our new advisor getting involved. The list of things we're going to email him soon are...   Talk to the house once a semester on student/professor relationships and how they can benefit you   Topics like how to talk to professors, do's and don'ts for getting points back, etc.  Let us take him out to dinner once a semester (open to brothers & pledges) Have him talk to brothers with GPAs < 2.5   See what they can do to improve their GPA (and why it's important) Point them in the right directions for getting help  Sponsor an occasional talk of his on campus   ""Professor XXXXX on *****fancy topic he's interested in*****, sponsored by YYYYYY"

Frat,33be3s,SugarFreeBrowny,3,Tue Apr 21 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"Not at all. The point of rush events are to get to know potential new members and see who you think fits in a fraternity. While the brothers are judging you on your character, you also should be judging them and seeing if the place is a fit for. Don't worry about being a loser, just be yourself. If you are a preppy individual already, the transition into the fraternity life culture may not be as drastic for you. If you want your best chances at getting a bid from somewhere you like, you have to dress the part, act the part, and just be a likeable cool guy.  Good luck!"

One of the greatest things about being a part of the experience is, if you do it right, it teaches you who you really are.  Sometimes it's a blatant slap in the face other times it's subtle.  Point is that you need to make the decision yourself on what is best for the fraternity and you. I know this isn't an answer and it may seem obscure now but take some time to think it over and think about how you can handle this situation as diplomatically as possible and with the best result for what you want to accomplish.  Making a decision like this will come along again especially in the work place, with friends and even family. Either decision you make today whether it's ultimately right or wrong will help you to be more comfortable w decisions like this further down the line in your life.  The only advice I could give is to continue to your job (complete your responsibilities) and get back to your personal life.

We came up with minimum requirements to be considered in good standing and gave them to brothers, which included a calendar of events. We printed them out so we could confirm which brothers got it. When we finally handed it to everyone, no one could say ""I didn't know ___ was required"" (unless they were actively ignoring us). This happened a lot anyway. Your worst absentee brothers will not change, so you'll just have to decide if he's worth keeping on for his dues money  We also got people lowering their commitment level to meet the minimum, some out of spite because ""fuck eboard"" but some because they were legitimately busy. You'd have to figure out for yourself if it'd be a net positive or net negative, but usually people will continue to be in the habit of showing up  The best you can do is reward people (and yourself) for showing up even if it's the bare minimum. If it's a budgeted committee, important events will have budget money for donuts and coffee, or pizza and soda. VPs having attendance problems for their committee meetings will buy a growler or something to share during small meetings."

Beta Kappa merged with Theta Chi. Kappa Nu merged with Phi Epsilon Pi. Phi Alpha merged with Phi Sigma Delta. Sigma Phi Epsilon merged with Theta Upsilon Omega. Phi Sigma Kappa merged with Phi Sigma Epsilon.   Universities, like fraternities, merge to strengthen themselves or become more well rounded.

We rent out fully furnished cabins with like hot tubs and stuff deep in the hills and the usual debauchery happens. Parties like Jock Jams (everyone wears sports gear) and Hayride (take a date up to a haunted hayride in the fall and drink a bottle/party). Then our philanthropy is pretty well known.

It's their closest friends, YOU FUCK AROUND WITH YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS, it's a fucking group chat between a bunch of zealous, hormonal immature 18-22 year olds who all live in a probably shitty house, drink shitty beer, have a shitty sense of humor and love to fuck around with their brothers. They are not hurting anyone, they are not video taping it, they are not broadcasting it, its their private venue to dick around, let them dick around. Fraternities are not a bunch of sexual deviants hellbent on rape and the eradication of black people. Get the fuck over it, looking at you media. Fuck.  Edit: To clarify I am not a phi delt at this school."

Obviously the second one is pretty fucked up, but I'm sure it was just an extreme case of busting balls rather than a serious threat of statutory rape"
Frat,32ucpv,RobinIsAGoodfellow,11,Thu Apr 16 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"Washburn is a public (government owned) university, so while Nationals can punish this, the university may not discipline the students or the fraternity over a free speech issue.  If they try, Washburn will just find itself on the wrong end of a civil rights action from the OU SAEs' attorney.  Same song, different verse."
Frat,32ucpv,RobinIsAGoodfellow,14,Thu Apr 16 20:17:46 2015 UTC,The article doesn't address how these private group messages came to the attention of Nationals.  Disgruntled pledge?  Disaffected brother?  Vengeful ex with one too many old passwords?  Maybe it's time someone investigated and sued the leaker for breaking into a private email system.
Frat,32ucpv,Twigs180,2,Thu Apr 16 20:26:56 2015 UTC,Not sure anyone cares but I know a good buddy who is a Phi Delt there and asked him what happened and told me it was a girl that I am acquainted with. I was drunk and texted her about it (which is why I called her a snitch) but here's a screenshot of our conversation and her version of the story. Which just supports the theory the biggest threat to any fraternity is sorority girls. http://imgur.com/hVbHteH
Frat,32ucpv,RobinIsAGoodfellow,3,Sun Apr 19 21:20:14 2015 UTC,That should be the end of that sorority's invitations to any fraternity function at Washburn - for at least five years until every one of their sisters is graduated and off campus.  Let them mix with and date the Geeds. Actions have consequences.

Frat,32ucpv,m2themichael,6,Sun Apr 19 22:05:03 2015 UTC,I don't think it will gain traction. Not nearly as bad as the SAE situation. Phi Delt Internationals usually does a good job at containing the media in these situations.
Frat,32ucpv,RobinIsAGoodfellow,14,Thu Apr 16 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"The problem over how all Nationals are learning to contain the media, is that Nationals seem to be falling into the bad habit of throwing their actives and their chapters under the bus to placate a media narrative that is not going away, no matter how many bloody sacrifices you offer at their unholy altar.  Does Nationals think they could fire a Nationals employee for something said in a private chat that was later hacked or stolen?  At some point, fraternities are going to have to start handling their discipline internally.  ""Dear Dean - We at Nationals are aware of an offense against our vows and standards which does not involve campus behavior, and we will be disciplining and counseling our errant brothers internally to assure our high standards are better met in future."""

My university also considers that you can haze fellow active members, so even having chapter go late can be considered hazing if someone takes issue with it. There's a sorority here who now can't have any meetings after 10 because of that.   Even with the above statement, singing is 100% mandatory for us. If you don't sing, you're getting dropped."

Frat,32os9i,Gingrich2016,22,Thu Apr 16 00:09:17 2015 UTC,Jesus fuck how's it like going to the Nancy Pelosi Institute of Pussiness? That's ridiculous.
Frat,32os9i,dalebonehart,5,Wed Apr 15 17:27:31 2015 UTC,So if a fraternity has a national exam it basically can't be on campus?  EDIT: Obviously not the case now that I think about it.

Frat,32os9i,BeastmasterDar,4,Thu Apr 16 00:24:47 2015 UTC,Can a university really ban a musical interest fraternity from singing?
Frat,32os9i,KeasbeyMornings,6,Wed Apr 15 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"You would think not, but it's technically against the rules set forth by the school because learning a song counts as ""learning unnecessary information"". It's stupid as hell.  edit: doesn't mean we don't do it and make our probationary members learn anyway."
Frat,32os9i,BeastmasterDar,3,Thu Apr 16 00:23:28 2015 UTC,Sweet Jesus that sounds like hell
Frat,32os9i,jaykyew,2,Wed Apr 15 19:32:25 2015 UTC,Do sing the song in the songbook or do something different?
Frat,32os9i,cburl04,4,Wed Apr 15 20:10:51 2015 UTC,"We sing all sorts of stuff. But we're a music fraternity, so singing is pretty essential. There are 9 songs the probationary members need to learn and perform for the chapter, and if they don't do a good enough job, they have to rehearse it and try again the next week. They have to serenade various and assorted women, from faculty to chapters of sororities, throughout their process."
Frat,32os9i,BeastmasterDar,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:21:54 2015 UTC,Thats a little intense compared to what we do at Gamma theta. Do they sing as a class or individually?
Frat,32os9i,cburl04,2,Thu Apr 16 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"As a class. We wouldn't ask them to do it individually. But if they know it well, then we continue to sound good when we serenade and otherwise sing together. I think it's good for probationary members to spend that much time rehearsing together, anyway."
Frat,32os9i,BeastmasterDar,2,Thu Apr 16 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"We do serenading here at Xi Delta, and most of our music is composed by some of our members, and then we do Serenade. We have our own arrangements of What Makes You Beautiful, Can't Help Falling in Love, and a few others."
Frat,32os9i,InconspicuousTree,2,Wed Apr 15 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"At Gamma Theta we just use the serenade from the songbook. We should really have other ones to use but we don't. It's kinda lame, but whatever. Our pm's are planning on serenading the other 2 music fraternities ladies during the joint social that they are putting on with the other new members of the respective organizations."
Frat,32os9i,cburl04,0,Thu Apr 16 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"Even with the above statement, singing is 100% mandatory for us. If you don't sing, you're getting dropped.   Yeah, music fraternities and social fraternities are very... different"
Frat,32os9i,Skyzord,18,Thu Apr 16 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"If that sort of thing is banned, that is really fucking sad."
Frat,32os9i,cowboyhaze,2,Wed Apr 15 15:23:18 2015 UTC,The semester before I came in IFC made my chapter stop and told us it was hazing and told us we cant have our pledges have a dress code.
Frat,32os9i,Dizzy2294,88,Thu Apr 16 05:55:45 2015 UTC,If you have to ask if it's hazing... it's probably not hazing.

Frat,32os9i,Distefcm,12,Fri Apr 17 16:17:14 2015 UTC,We added a couple of brothers into it and the hazing worry went away.
Frat,32os9i,jorboyd,13,Wed Apr 15 17:15:59 2015 UTC,Its literally that simple.  Making the event pledge only = hazing.  Adding a couple actives and the hazing issues are no more.
Frat,32os9i,maninorbit,6,Wed Apr 15 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"Fraternity just got reported for doing this and currently going through a lot of shit at my school. They've always done it and people love it, but ""it's hazing because it makes few uncomfortable"""
Frat,32os9i,jesitloml,3,Wed Apr 15 15:59:29 2015 UTC,I view it as more beneficial for the house more than any particular individual so it isn't hazing.
Frat,32os9i,IamUltimate,6,Wed Apr 15 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"These days, hazing is whatever the school wants it to be. I've mentioned it here before, but my chapter got hit for hazing when a girl at a party snapchatted another girl handing one of our pledges a bottle and saying he should drink it.   But as for a ""real"" answer, I'd say that as long as you're in decent standing with the school, they won't be calling that hazing. You should be fine."
Frat,32os9i,dalebonehart,2,Wed Apr 15 17:23:26 2015 UTC,Wait...what...how?
Frat,32os9i,qwertub,3,Wed Apr 15 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"Because liberals. I have a feeling that if I as a male went to a sorority event and told one of their new members to drink, then I would be the one getting in trouble instead of their entire sorority. But common sense doesn't usually apply when punishing fraternities."
Frat,32os9i,dalebonehart,7,Wed Apr 15 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"it depends on what you do. at my school, hazing is ANYTHING that could possibly damage any member physically and/or mentally. Even calling a pledge a moron for doing something that was actually pretty stupid is considered hazing. For our ceremony, we definitely do some things that fuck with them mentally, but no more than what a younger brother or a good friend would do to you as a prank. I guess it also comes down to how mentally strong the new guy is."
Frat,32os9i,JackAssKidd,3,Wed Apr 15 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"We make pledges serenade with us and we take the pledges around to all the houses, but not really ever both at the same time. But I don't see a problem."
Frat,32os9i,mcollins1,3,Wed Apr 15 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"At my campus literally everything is hazing. If the university had its way you'd show up to a rush event, sign a paper, and be a full-fledged brother."
Frat,32os9i,DarkSideMoon,3,Wed Apr 15 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"The anti-frat circlejerk is out of control. I have some great memories from the two serenades I did as a pledge. The majority of brothers, sorority girls and pledges find it entertaining, fuck the haters."
Frat,32os9i,GreatWhite_Buffalo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:17:26 2015 UTC,Our School just recently made us stop serenades because one pledge was bipolar and freaked out on everyone. the local and state newspapers took that story and ran with it.
Frat,32os9i,vanderpool5,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:39:08 2015 UTC,I would say if you add brothers to it there is no way it should be considered hazing for this event.

Frat,32o8ai,fratopotamus1,17,Wed Apr 15 11:35:51 2015 UTC,"Well you're really not gonna find any information about fraternity parties on the internet. Most are held only for brother's of the house with another sorority, are invitation only, or are for an assortment of university students. Generally if you have friends in the house you'd be able to go, but if not no. The stereotype that you see of houses throwing giant parties for anyone to come to isn't very prevalent. I know some houses charge at the door and let students in, but at least where I'm at I've never actually seen one and I know they exist, but they're few and far between. It's a huge liability and risk to have people you don't know drinking and partying on your property, and something that has gotten a lot of houses in trouble."
Frat,32o8ai,Willie_Waylon_and_Me,8,Wed Apr 15 12:03:01 2015 UTC,"Well the first thing that comes to mind is that's right around finals time for some schools.

I'm not saying your a bad person, but if you do manage to get into a party and the cops bust you for the biggest meth possession east of the Mississippi, guess whose held liable? The fraternity. Unless you become bff's with a fraternity president during your stay, I wouldn't count on it. And if the fraternity does let randoms in, I wouldn't count on it being a great party."

Frat,32ikf8,YJ87,6,Tue Apr 14 05:06:52 2015 UTC,"More info on why so many locals.  Back in the early '60s, Dartmouth declared all fraternities had to be open to and ""race, creed or color"" or something like that. At the time, most fraternity chapters were White Christian, so many chapters went local instead of getting special permissions from their nationals."
Frat,32ikf8,RobinIsAGoodfellow,12,Tue Apr 14 12:49:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, branding puzzles me.   As far as I know, no IFC fraternity brands pledges.  Why brand someone permanently with your letters until you know they are going to be a full brother. Would any IFC fraternity even allow a pledge to have a brand before initiation?  If the pledge dropped, then someone would be walking around forever with your letters who was never a brother. So branding seems to be a rite for fully initiated brothers.  Branding is not being done on aspiring members seeking to join as a condition of membership, and not done on members seeking to advance as a condition of advancement.   And so I don't understand how branding members is hazing.  Other than the degree of sudden pain, how is branding any different legally than fully initiated brothers getting a tattoo of the fraternity letters or crest?"

Frat,32n4vw,RobinIsAGoodfellow,3,Wed Apr 15 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"Talk with your dad, particularly if he was a college athlete and fraternity man.  If you swim in college, the two-a-day time commitment will be greater than your high school workouts.  And academically, college is a huge step up from even the best private high schools - you will invest many more hours reading, studying, writing papers outside of class than you will sit inside of class - you will be challenged on a very different level than in high school (assuming you don't go to a kindercollege).  Getting the most from a fraternity is a time commitment too.  Timewise, being in a fraternity is akin to having two extra classes in your schedule every semester.  You may want to spend your first semester on campus getting accustomed to your academic load and swimming.  Then, if you are handling your academics well with your swimming commitment, you might want to rush the spring semester of your freshman year - or the fall of your sophomore year in the swimming offseason.  Many disciplined college athletes can handle their academic load, plus their training and competition schedules, plus fraternity life.  If you aspire to medical school, dental school, vet school, an MBA, or law school, your college GPA will be paramount, your college course work will be maximally challenging, and you will have plenty of competition  - so if you want to be a doc or a lawyer, you may need to invest an even greater commitment to college academics - and in that case either your competitive swimming or your aspirations to join a fraternity may need to be cut.   Doing two things well is more important and more rewarding and more fun than doing three things poorly.  You should also know that at some colleges, the swim team spends so much time together in training, that the swimmers often have an off-campus house where many of the team live and party - and that substitutes for a fraternity for them - another reflection of the simple fact that your time and energy in college are not unlimited.  Oh, and it's ""fraternity,"" not frat."

Frat,32gaoz,scsingh93,74,Mon Apr 13 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"Condense your message to a maximum of three points, and push those points as many times as possible during the interview.  Simplicity and repetition are the path to audience understanding.  Try to tie every question back to your three key points.  I would suggest as key points:   Leadership development - even though only 2% of US males are fraternity men, most US presidents, US Senators, US Congressmen, and CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies have been fraternity men.  Fraternities teach leadership better than any institution except the US military. Philanthropy (call it charity fundraising for the Brits) - Fraternities and sororities (DO NOT CALL US GREEKS - that will be wildly misunderstood in Britain) are the largest charity fundraising organization in the US.  And it's not just the individual charity projects on every campus every year, rather it's the training, experience, and expectation that fraternity men will continue to be involved in leading charitable giving throughout our lives.  We are the largest scale organization that trains men in how to continuously lead charitable efforts. Competitiveness within the Brotherhood pushes each fraternity man to better themselves - in academics (higher grades) (DON'T SAY GPA) and higher graduation rates; and in sport (rather than athletics).  We hold one another to high standards and we push one another to grow.  When we fail to meet our standards, we self-correct.  In each of the high profile cases, the National Fraternity has suspended the chapter before the university acted - we reward ourselves - but we also discipline ourselves.   I would stay away from values development and ritual - that just invites criticism of tabloid behavior conflicting with ritual.  If hazing comes up, point to the tough upbringing British Royals are led through - Prince Charles'  college in Australia had no hot water; most Royals serve difficult duty in the military as preparation for leadership.  If alcohol comes up, point out that we often live together in a large House on campus, so if we enjoy drinking with our friends when our schoolwork is done, we are safer than driving to bars - push the Work Hard / Play Hard ethic.  If sexual assault comes up, push back.  ""I personally know of no fraternity man who would ever consider forcing himself on a women.  We love women; we revere women; and we want women to love us.  And we are fortunate to win the attentions of some of the smartest, most beautiful, most accomplished women on campus.""  Smile (except when discussing tragedies).  Be likable.  Be charming.  Be exceptionally courteous, but don't allow yourself to be interrupted but once - ask to finish your answer. If the host or another guest talks over you, just stop talking, smile and shake your head side to side.   Good luck.  Make us proud."

Beach day, picnic day, watch the fight at buffalo wild wings, football game, etc. No cost means less worries.   As far as repairing your rep, start making friends with the less hot (bigger but sweet) girls. They need less convincing to hang out with dudes and come in greater numbers. by convincing them to go, the hotter ones get brought in. Also don't shoot for your hottest sorority at first.

Your best bet, at least at first, is to do things sober with them to try change their perceptions of you. Support their philanthropies and show up at to those events and similar events in the Greek Community where they more or less are forced to be around you. Get to know as many people in those sororities as you can. The more girls that know and like your chapter, the more they will pressure their social chairs to respond.   Another thing you could try is throwing sober mixers with them. There are bunch of threads on the sub that have suggestions for those."

Also, stress in your chapter report that social growth is not only your duty, it's the entire brotherhood's. It's imperative that all of the brothers take the time to foster friendships with sorority girls. A lot of times pre-semester sorority social chairs will send out an email to their sisters asking them to list a few fraternities they want to do events with. They won't be interested in formally socializing with you if they know nothing about your fraternity and have no connections with any brothers."

I have plenty of brothers who don't take advantage of the opportunities available to being affiliated like assuming a leadership position, networking with alumni and other chapters, etc.   I think greek life naturally attracts a lot of motivated individuals who get a lot of out of it, but thats only if you want to get something out of it.

Group of like-minded people  Organizational/social structure Academic and conduct expectations Team atmosphere Real life experience with group dynamics, leadership, politics, PR, event planning, ect Networking Ability to find your niche, especially on a large state school campus (make a big pond feel smaller)   The statistic that Greeks graduate at a higher rate than non-Greeks is largely due to the above.  It's easy to come into college and fuck around - then before you know it you have no friends and are on academic probation.

Honestly, shouldnt the goal be to do no harm? In this sense I wouldn't even bother with the stats. Look at the founding pieces. Every fuckin fraternity has themes throughout ritual that are the principles on which we were all founded. The best part is they are clearly advertised. For example:  Pi Kappa Alpha on their site reads, ""To create an uncommon and lifelong brotherhood that develops leaders and encourages service to others for the betterment of our communities.""  Beta Theta Pi posts, "" Every member will live Beta Theta Pi’s values. Core Values:  To build lasting bonds of friendship and brotherhood, Beta calls for, Mutual Assistance,  Intellectual Growth, Trust,  Responsible Conduct,  Integrity.""  You get the point. No need to dig into ritual but theoretically thats why we were founded. Now do we all live that way? No. But its worth a shot.   EDIT: yes I am gonna be that guy who says turn to the ritual."

Some thoughts I have:  -Involvement, but not just like people being in clubs and stuff. Just having at least a few guys involved in outside stuff, especially with leadership positions in stuff like student government. It increases the visibility and profile of your chapter, and makes it look even better in the eyes of your administrators and nationals.  -Looking the part: it may seem shallow, but it really helps if none of your guys look or dress like total goobers. What looking the part means varies by school and region, but each of you know what does and doesn't work on your campus.  -Social life: Not just having a lot of parties, but having good ones when you do. It doesn't matter if you party more than everyone else if you just have open parties with low attendance every time. Have a big party every few weeks and make sure it's a really good one, in the weeks when you don't then have a date function at the house or a mixer or something. Keep the demand high. And make sure your brothers don't act like shitheads around girls or other fraternities and do anything to hurt your name.  There's more factors and this is just simplified. But if I think there's one small thing that will help most chapters, it's just to not try too hard. Work with what you have, and if you aren't the top house don't try to get there immediately. Know that it's a slow process. It doesn't look good if you try to dress the frattiest and rage the hardest, because if you're visibly trying it just shows you're looking over your shoulder. Make an effort to make it look effortless, and just have fun with what you've got. It's just college."

They need to know that it's not usually going to come quickly, and that they need to work very hard over time to get there.

Different chapters have different groups of people and one that you fit in with I might hate and vice versa.   That being said the fraternity that's ""best"" is probably somewhere in the middle/high up of all the ranks, not the house that only parties; they're too busy partying to be productive. Not the house that only does philanthropy, they're no fun.  Not the house that's the biggest, they aren't selective enough, etc."
Frat,32ejh9,callmeroo,2,Mon Apr 13 07:29:25 2015 UTC,This was kind of what I was getting at. Usually you can guess which frat is considered top by taking Number of members*$dues=Rank.

I'm in a 100 old historically small chapter that's had its ups and downs, and a few years ago with only around 10 undergraduate members. Our nationals told us that our ""target size"" was 80 members. We're at 24 right now, but our target is still something like 50."
Frat,32ar5w,ablatner,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well, i'm assuming they've already gotten their bids. If that's the case you're just going to have to wait it out. Usually the weak links will drop due to how long the process of re-chartering/chartering is and they don't want to put in the work. As for the others that may be a little odd, get the guys that are high caliber to help mold the weirder folks into reputable members of the chapter."
Frat,32ar5w,smaynar3,12,Wed Apr 15 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"Remember that very, very rarely will founding fathers see the fruit of their labor. That being said, when you recruit I recommend using the angle of ""This is something new. Something that you can be a part of. A way you can leave a legacy that will last a lifetime. This leadership opportunity is also something in its purest form that you will be hard to find in any other fraternity already on campus (case-by-case basis, but I doubt a university would have two fraternities colonizing at the same time)."" Best of luck!"
Frat,32ar5w,Phaggle,3,Wed Apr 15 21:46:14 2015 UTC,"We were able to recruit a few great younger members by pitching the fact that they'll actually be able to have an impact on the culture of the house. Also completely agree with quality over quantity. By the end of their stay, our consultants were giving bids to way too many kids and we ended up having 4 or 5 who are detrimental to the house."
Frat,32ar5w,MiracleMavs,2,Sun Apr 12 06:54:17 2015 UTC,"I personally went through recolonization. If the recruiters are worth half a damn, they already know quality over quantity. However you should definitely try to scale your founding class proportionally to your schools Greek life. If you have a large Greek Life, say on avg. 100+ guys per fraternity, shoot for about 40 guys. For an avg of 50-100 try for like 20-25 guys. Anything less than 50 guys per, use your discretion. To collect names, go to sororities. Ask them about any guys who might fit your criteria and are not Greek affiliated at the moment. Another option is to go to your IFC and get the drop list from Rush. These are a list of guys who are interested in Fraternity life and you may find some really awesome guys. Finally, recommend your friends. Many of our guys who were in the founding class were friends of other guys. You already know what kind of men they are and if they can help you.  You'll have a ratio of 1:2:1. That means 25% of the guys are going to be super involved. These are the guys who will get you up and running. 50% of the guys will be ambiguous. They will show up to chapter and events but under the right conditions you can get them into the top 25%. Then there are the other 25%, who are there for the party. These guys are important on the social scene but don't really want to help with the admin side of building the fraternity. These guys are the highest risk for dropping.   The first semester to a year is the most important time for making your reputation. You fuck up here, you fucked up for a long time. My suggestion is to win over the sororities. If the ladies like you, they'll recommend guys to you during Rush. If they hate you, they will sink you.   Finally, do not try to play on the same level as the other established fraternities. You will lose, especially on a large Greek life campus. Find your strengths and play to them. If that's philanthropy, awesome. If it's brotherhood, fantastic. As you grow you will be able to level the playing field. Be creative and original, it'll help set you apart.  If you have any questions, just pm me. I'd be more than happy to pass along any advice I can."
Frat,32ar5w,bignosebill,2,Sun Apr 12 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"If your alumni are really serious about recolonizing, lean hard on them to help with recruiting.  That is, get them to help in identifying prospective new members; don't guarantee anything, though.  Most of the alumni will understand that someone may not be a good fit for the ""new"" chapter, but some won't.    Also, lean on them hard for money.  Many will be willing to pony up, but utilize any donations from them wisely.  Piss it away and they'll stop giving.  Go after the ones that are late 30s and up since they are 1) likely at a point in their lives where they are financially stable and 2) have sons, nephews, or know kids of friends either already attending your school or about to be."

Saying 'No' to a brother's instruction doesn't automatically mean we're dropping you on the spot. That would be immature and reactionary. I said 'No' a few times as a pledge. I even (stupidly) said ""Go fuck yourself"" to a brother when I was pledging. Definitely paid for that one. But I was never dropped because I was able to justify my reasons.

Frat,321s1p,brendintosh,7,Fri Apr 10 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"Very good.   I initially drew up a proposal of expansion for the fraternity to my University. I contacted my cousin, who is President of his chapter of the same fraternity, and he put me in touch with some guys at Nationals. I sent the Director of Expansion my proposal and he loved it. He asked that I meet my University's Greek Directors to discuss the expansion on their behalf. They too liked the idea of the expansion, but they were hesitant because our University had allowed three other fraternities expand in the last two years. After a few more meetings, the Greek Directors saw my way and decided my proposal, filled with reasons to expand, why it would be successful, and the contact information of an interest group I created, was worth bringing to our IFC. I presented my proposal to the IFC and highlighted points that would make the expansion worthwhile and successful.  After three weeks of discussing which fraternity (of 7 potential organizations) would be allowed to expand, if our University chose to allow said expansion, the IFC chose the fraternity I chose to expand to our campus (which I just found out today, as Nationals did too). Next step is to coordinate with Nationals to begin the expansion and ease into our University's  already booming Greek community. By Spring 2016, we could have colony on campus and I'm very excited!"
Frat,321s1p,Floater4,2,Fri Apr 10 03:07:19 2015 UTC,That's great! Its pretty incredible to be a founding father.

Frat,322wni,Gekkidan,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:30:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Do you have any examples of unique things that groups have done before?
Frat,322wni,TDenverFan,2,Fri Apr 10 04:05:14 2015 UTC,One thing that helps with recruiting is requiring all members to be in a club/organization besides the fraternity. That way they'll make friends in those clubs and can recruit some members that way
Frat,322wni,BourbonAndFrisbee,2,Fri Apr 10 04:56:47 2015 UTC,"I mean damn OP, if ""not recruiting new members will literally destroy our chapter"" isn't enough motivation, then you need to focus on internal bonds first. Until your chapter wants to do things as a group they sure as heck won't convince many people to join."
Frat,322wni,Gingrich2016,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:25:07 2015 UTC,"If your events aren't enticing your own brothers, why would they attract recruits? My advice would be to get your most dedicated members to work on making events more fun so that people really want to show up. Co-sponsor stuff with sororities. Have some fun brotherhood events. Throw a big open party. If everyone is having fun, then you will naturally attract new recruits. Your chapter morale will also improve and guys will work hard to recruit people out of dorms/ class/ intramural sports/ whatever. It is all about making people want to be around you.   Definitely break the mindset of ""enforcing"" attendance. You don't want guys there for a gift card or a break from chores."
Frat,322wni,MC_Skittles,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid answers so far. Work on chapter internals first to strengthen your brotherhood. After that your brothers should feel responsible to do their part and will be more motivated to participate. Call them out if its necessary, dont be afraid to speak your mind. And as stated, ask sorority girls if they would like to recommend guys that arent greek yet. Not only will that widen your reah, but the girls will want to hang out with you guys more since they are kind of having a say in who can be in your chapter, which can in turn motivate your brothers to work harder to keep these relations strong"
Frat,322wni,ghostwritethewhip,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:10:32 2015 UTC,Whats the average fraternity size at your school? 20 seems on the small side and honestly you're not going to be able to compete with larger and more established frats directly. What you need to do is emphasize to potentials how you are different from other fraternities. TBH though if everyone is only in it for the parties its probably not worth saving

So this year I helped to pull in the biggest pledge class we have had next to the founding class. One thing that helped was that me and one of my brothers were roommates in the dorm. We talked casually about our brotherhood and got a lot of interest. We also make sure our brothers are involved on campus in student life activities. Our frat seems to be a very similar size to yours with about the same number of brothers graduating out in a matter of days now, and it happened last year too and we brought in as many brothers as we graduated out. So in short. Just show people why your brotherhood is the best and the rushees will come. Pm me if you have any questions"

This process was inefficient, prolonged and incredibly damaging to our organization’s morale.   Bolding mine.  I mean I guess it's obvious that any investigation would be those things, but this just gave me flashbacks to the last ""three week"" investigation that our chapter had to go through. If there's anything consistent about all of these stories, it's how difficult these investigations are for a chapter and it's leadership. When you are under investigation, it's like you are working a part-time job on top of all of your classes, just to keep your university's disciplinary board moving towards any resolution.  I completely sympathize with this AXO chapter. Much rather give it all up than go through that agony. Honestly? Maybe that's what Penn wanted all along."

Fraternity life is fundamentally different than dorm life, so you'd just be getting acclimated to 'college' when you blow it all up and get acclimated to 'Fraternity + College'.    Also, by joining a chapter, you instantly have a group of friends looking out for you, catching your newbie mistakes and helping smooth the transition from Mom & Dad's to 'on your own'.

There will be two kinds of damages special and general; general damages are to make the aggrieved party ""whole again"" basically money to restore them to the previous status - maybe a PR campaign call ""We get laid - we do not need to rape"" or ""If i was going to gang rape someone it would be someone who wasn't a liar"" or maybe ""I don't need to rape to fuck crazy girls - just ask my Ex!"".

Just as JohnOBrosley said, leave the racial politics in your dorm room, rush every House, and pref the Houses you like.

That does not make it any less frustrating that we are wasting each others time. I understand the rush them all and pref mentality. I think it's the safest way to get a bid somewhere. Putting myself in the position where i'm not welcome sucks. Some houses don't want me there. Some don't want me there because of tradition. That is just something that I just have to deal with. I am worried though about rushing houses where they like me and its reciprocated but, it's a no bid. That alumni won't allow it or, even worse I get a bid and have to be dropped because of alumni. Not because i'm not a fit or fucked up. I just want to figure out a way to cut the chaff and put time toward houses I have a chance with."

Frat,31wvos,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Thu Apr 9 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about the Alumni pressuring the Actives to drop you as a Pledge, first look at the composites and see if there have been ANY black guys in the Chapter in the last five years or so.  If they have a recent black alumni, see if you can get in touch with him and ask his opinion.  If you seem to be the first African American the Chapter has rushed, then leave the racial politics aside unless/until you are honored with a bid.  If they honor you with a bid to their House, THEN is the time to gently ask the President if he thinks the Alumni will also be good with having you as a new Brother - after a bid is extended but before accepting their bid.  Don't make it a big deal, just tell the President you have one short question before accepting their bid, and then ask.  And then it's done - for good.  You are a Pledge, not the Black Pledge, but just another lowly unworthy Pledge.  Don't make this about race or you will lose.  On the other hand, if Social Justice, Racial Activism, Gender Activism is a big part of who you are, then it's unlikely you are going to fit in well at a big Southern SEC fraternity, and you need to find another path."

If you pick up weird vibes anywhere you can decide whether or not you want to continue rushing at that particular house. If you find somewhere you like that seems to reciprocate that sentiment it may be wise to take one of the brothers aside, most preferably one that is serving as your point man or just that you've gotten to know better than the rest, and diplomatically ask about the race element. I'm a Northerner, so I can only speculate what those universities are like race-wise, but I have to imagine your concerns wouldn't be coming out of nowhere for these guys and they may well have gotten the question before. It may be a little awkward, but your worries are valid and rush is honestly the time when some of the tough questions should be asked."

This movie wasn't about chris kyle busting up in bagdad with 2 ak 47s mowing down cartoony terrorists who are tripping over themselves. I loved this movie beacuse it shows both sides of war. The glory and the fame that comes from being a war hero and also the personal turmoil that accompanies it. Its a film that can provoke great discussion about war, PTSD, and many other things.

Interestingly enough we get the best results when talking to entertainment groups (like SONY Productions), because they do a lot of cross-promotion with other products. So instead on contacting Energy Drink Company directly we'll contact Sony, who will then send us literally five boxes full of shit that have been cross-promoted with upcoming movies that have college kids as the target demographic.

I'm not saying it's right one way or another, but while I was still active we'd offer taxi cabs to people who were in especially bad shape after walking into our house, free of charge.  the fact is, is that you are responsible for everybody that walks through that door and drinks your alcohol.  it sucks, but those are the rules.  it's on us to step up"

That aside,  the universities act  in loco parentes; so,  you aren't comparing the same thing  The real crux of the issue is the vast majority of people at fraternity parties are underage.

Does anyone monitor and meter number of drinks served to a particular guest (marking on a wristband for each drink, drink tickets)?  Does anyone have sober monitors reliably cut off alcohol for a particular guest (cutting off wristband)?  The very best Risk Management policy ever truly accepted by fraternities is not letting drunks behind the wheel of a car - sober drivers / pledge taxis have saved more lives than Nationals' modules will ever save."

Tailgate as usual with our football buddies who will bring their Dad's.   -Early afternoon, recover from drinking hang out with Dad. Some people go get lunch, most just hang out around the house and watch more football.  -Late afternoon, have a big cookout, usually casual drinking  -Evening, have a party with our Dad's and a sorority's Dad's. Lights are up high, play older music, a ton of drinking games, have a blast. If 21, go to the bars with Dads.  Mom's Day:  -Morning, brunch with our mom's have some other stuff going on too to help entertain.  -Afternoon, most Mom's go off with their sons shopping or something. Go to the mall, get some new clothes, or just go do something. Grab dinner with friends and their moms.  -Evening, have a party with a sorority(s) and their moms. This is honestly one of the most fun things ever. Might sound lame but the Mom's are a ton of fun. Most of them will drink plenty and encourage you to too (you'd be surprised).

Honestly, they're pretty bad-ass in the way they function. But again, they don't really do much on campus. Some of them wear letters, but they only have like 1-2 events each year.  The Latino fraternity however, is much different. They have a smaller house on campus. They have mixers with the sororities. Numerous philanthropy events. Every brother is a genuinely good person, and they're helping to bring our greek community closer together.

As a broad generality, MCG fraternities have more trouble with violence - particularly violent hazing like beat-downs and branding ( http://diverseeducation.com/article/8216/ ) where IFC fraternities have more trouble with drinking and with servile & embarrassing hazing.  As someone mentioned, grades are much lower at MGC fraternities.  Since legal segregation ended two generations ago, there has been an increasing trend, particularly among minorities to self-segregate in employment, housing, post-secondary education, church, and social activities.  Frankly, minorities tend to self-cluster where they see others of their race.  It is a puzzling result from the hard won victories of the Civil Rights Movement.  I find it interesting that most IFC fraternity men actually have a greater history of playing sports on a team with minority men than do non-IFC fraternity men - because IFC fraternity men were more likely to be involved in team sports - (football and basketball and track specifically) while in middle school and high school, compared to non - IFC fraternity men (GDIs) who were less likely to be involved in school sponsored team sports."

Some are known to really excel when it comes to philanthropic events, but otherwise don't do much. Others try really hard to be ""fratty"" in the MGC way -- stepping, doing their calls at every opportunity, etc.  They're just different, though as a rule I don't understand the attraction of joining a group where everyone looks and comes from the same exact culture as me. I joined a fraternity to expose myself to new ideas and experiences, and have brothers from all around the world that make sure I'm broadening my mind every day.  Being a proud Latino is great. But joining a club where the dominant characteristic is being a proud Latino is a bit too insular for my tastes."

It's counter productive for us to be scorning an incredibly humanizing photo when we so often complain of misrepresentation in the media. This is more indicative of brotherhood than anything major news is running right now so let's not blaspheme OP for posting a picture that, while morbid, is a better portrayal than much of what media is conveying. Besides, the brothers pictured wouldn't have allowed the photographers presence if they didn't want this being seen."

See 'The Purdue Case' as an example of it brought to court. Fraternities used to be entirely underground and not associated with the school at all, they only became integrated with the school when there were agreements because the school wanted to reign them in and houses gained certain benefits of being official University groups.   some of these orgs are really bad, but no one stops them   Are they doing illegal things? One tip. Don't get involved with houses which are doing things blatantly against the law for the most part. I wouldn't suggest getting involved with a group that sells drugs out of their house, or regularly commits some crime (hold say underage drinking and recreational drug use) but other things you can get in a hell of a lot of trouble for."

There is a recognized greek life here, but they're not worth joining. That's why I'm curious. I know at UPenn, and the SUNYs underground orgs are pretty common and there no one gets in trouble or anything, but being that they have the same policies I'm curious if administration or anyone can or will ever do anything to these groups."

As an underground you can tell the IFC, school, anyone to fuck off, quite literally, if they come calling.  The biggest problem I'd say is insurance, but the handful of big fraternal insurance groups will insure locals for quite a fee.  I imagine you could somehow get a homeowner's policy to cover your ass too, I know my parents have one that's pretty much a blanket policy for anything that happens on the property, up to a fairly large amount."

I don't think a school can kick someone out for being in an off-campus organization unless it's a private school that doesn't accept money from the government (some Christian schools). Some fraternities on campus are bad and they are often the ones that get kicked off which is why they have a worse reputation, they probably aren't doing much different stuff from when they were recognized but got kicked off for doing bad things.  As for staying out of trouble with the cops it's about being smart, same way as recognized fraternities and non-greeks staying out of trouble for hosting parties.

That being said, there's no real ""tailgating"" the derby unless you live near it and plop down on your front lawn. Quite a few fraternities have houses adjacent to the downs though, so you might be in luck if you contact the right people. There also isn't really a tailgate outside of the track because outside of the track is hundreds of police barricades, pop up vendors, religious crazies and massive crowds/lines of people walking to the derby.  My suggestion is get trashed in your hotel room or a bar and walk there. You could sneak flasks in, probably. Drinks are expensive there, but strong."

Frat,31nban,StuckeyMurdog,5,Tue Apr 7 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"I hope Phi Kappa Psi uses the opportunity before them wisely and fully.  This is one of those few times when justice truly demands piling on.  From the libel columns linked in other threads, it seems the case against RS is very winnable - the only real issue remaining is determining the damages.  I hope they bankrupt the magazine.  Just as importantly though, UVA itself must be brought to heal over its President's unjust knee jerk reaction against all fraternities.  Constraining the ongoing trend of punish now, punish everyone, investigate later, then punish again, would do fraternities even more good in the long run.  UVA is a State University, and as such UVA must honor students' constitutional rights on and off campus, including the rights to due process.  A civil rights action against UVA might drag some deans kicking and screaming to better respect the rights and privacy of fraternities and to let law enforcement alone investigate crimes, not Star Chamber Tribunals with predetermined outcomes."

They should carefully examine every photo of protesters who stood in front of the frat building, identify as many of them as possible by name and sue each and every one of them for slander. Make them accountable for their actions.   When these SWJ assholes whine and complain, offer them a settlement that they agree to withdraw from UVA immediately and never attend a university or college in the state of Virginia ever again.  Sue the protesters for slander directly. Keep it a civil suit between the frat and each protester and cut the university out of the loop altogether. Identify as many of them as possible, file suit against the worst offenders, get each one of them alone in a room with a lawyer and tell them they will end up in court and pay through the nose in a civil suit. Then tell them the frat will settle with them and they can avoid paying monetary damages if they agree to withdraw from the university immediately - the same day - and never attend again.   It might not work for every protester, but it might work for a significant number of them. Give the fuckers a choice between spending thousands on legal fees vs leaving the university.  Even if every dime of settlement money ends up in the pockets of lawyers and the frat doesn't get anything, it would be worth it to change the culture of harassment against fraternities on the UVA campus."

False rape accusations may be rare, but there is no proof that that is the case.  ""Statistics"" certainly haven't shown anything of the sort and it is ok to accept that it is an impossible thing to measure accurately.   it seems especially extreme to completely fabricate such an elaborate and horrifying story   I just read an article about a woman who poisoned 3 of her babies because she was mentally ill and craved the attention.  We have no idea if anything happened to Jackie any more than anyone else.

He failed to get breakfast for whatever reason at which point a select few brothers told him to jump off the bridge into the water as punishment. They then tried to cover the whole thing up.

For some context, our house is located across from the dorms in the direction of the bars, so it's not uncommon for drunk freshman to walk past our house on the way home. Anyways, this one particularly inebriated guy must have eaten some serious shit on his walk home from the baseball bar crawl because he was literally using his hand to keep blood from gushing out of the back of his cracked skull. Now being the good natured gentlemen that we are there was no fucking way we were going to let bleedy here go back to his dorm room to pass out and die in a pool of his own brain fluid so we pulled him over, convinced his belligerent ass to sit down, gave him some water, and called 911. Within seconds of the local EMS, PD, and FD showing up, Ms. Citizen Journalist hustles herself across the street from her dorm, determined to get ""the scoop."" After about the third time I told her we weren't having a party, the guy wasn't a member, and this was a charity event and we were just responsible students engaging in a little bystander intervention, Suzy Journalism realizes there isn't much of a story. I invited her to our event and introduced her to the guys who saved this guys life, told her to pass the story onto her editor, and wished her a good day. No one outside of my chapter and the people at the event ever heard that fucking story. One little detail changed and it would have been national news. Fuck media bias.

I thought your brothers were supposed to be the ones you could count on when you were in trouble.   Once again I agree, but we must acknowledge the tension within this relationship. On the one hand we are all members of fraternities and as such pledge to help each other as individuals. On the other hand we are equally obligated to our respective rituals and its institutional values which we accept as our own.  If these two things come into conflict, it puts us in a difficult position. Do we defend our brother, even if he may be in the wrong (in violation of our fraternal values)? Or do we distance ourselves from him and renew our dedication to our ritual with vigor?  Whatever the answer in this specific case may be, there's one thing we know for certain: we need to start holding our brothers to a higher standard, and take our pledges more seriously. In doing that, we can avoid the difficult question of what side to take when something goes wrong."

Frat,318kto,CigBreak,3,Thu Apr 2 22:05:36 2015 UTC,Mostly apathy. My class is getting old and a few of my brothers have already graduated. The younger guys are just happy to get fucked up and dont care about the finances because their parents will cover it. It also worth mentioning that seniors typically can't be officers so my class will soon pass on all of its power to the classes below us.
Frat,318kto,Dragon_Toast_1880,6,Thu Apr 2 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"It all starts with recruitment remember that, if you recruit guys who just want to party that is the direction the chapter will go. Also what I found from my time on the exec board was that transparency of the officers is important especially in budget matters. But ultimately what would work great is if you went to exec and let them your frustrations, but not just the frustrations give them solutions to fix your problems otherwise your just complaining. Another thing to remember is that just because you are a founding father does not mean you have all the answers, chapters change greatly from colonies to chapters"
Frat,318kto,corporat,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"Check your bylaws/constitution. Usually it takes a majority or supermajority vote of the chapter to kick someone out. If that's the case call up someone from National, hopefully someone you're already friendly with since you're a founding member.

Guys, man up.  If brothers making epic fun of another brother's quirks is not good sport within the confines of the Chapter House, then you need to just take down your letters and melt into the GDI / SJW / dorm rat cesspool that will be flipping burgers and staffing call centers after college.  Leaders are strong, self-assured, confident, and principled.

One of my friends joked about how ""Bombs over Baghdad"" and ""Rosa Parks"" were the two Outkast songs you can't use for a party theme, and the Cav Daily writer he was talking to picked it up and ran with it for the April Fool's edition of the paper.

Frat,30zals,TheBROinBROHIO,5,Tue Mar 31 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"But of course that's the thorny problem - by siding against the RFRA, you ARE discriminating - just not against gays.  This is one of those challenging choices in a democracy where one group's Rights is necessarily pitted against another group's Rights in a zero sum game that courts must weigh and balance.  The RFRA passed in Indiana was designed, specifically to direct the State courts to allow a civil defendant in a discrimination suit to defend themselves by claiming that the discrimination alleged was required by their religious beliefs.  The Indiana law says that the government cannot intrude on a person's religious liberty unless it can prove a compelling interest in imposing that burden and do so in the least restrictive way.  Here is the law: http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/27/text-indianas-religious-freedom-law/70539772/   In a real world case, remember the plight of the family owned bakery that refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay wedding.  The baker offered to refer the couple to another baker of similar talent, apologizing and telling the couple that his deeply held religious beliefs told him that gay marriage was wrong and so he could not participate in their wedding by baking the cake. He felt that baking their cake would be a sin against his God.  The engaged couple sued and won.  Pretty simple, right?  The baker should not discriminate against gay couples, right?  But forcing a deeply religious baker who believes (rightly or wrongly) his religion teaches him that gay marriage is wrong to bake a cake that denigrates his religious canon ALSO DISCRIMINATES - it just discriminates against religious liberty, rather than discriminating against gays.  The RFRA would allow the baker to make his case in court to defend himself against a lawsuit that he discriminated against the gay couple - and the court would have to balance the competing rights.  Without the RFRA, the baker could not raise that defense because the court would disallow him from doing so.  Remember the original Federal RFRA was introduced in 1993 by then Congressman Chuck Shumer (not widely known as a conservative) and signed into law by President Bill Clinton (not widely known as a religious zealot).  Then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama voted for the State Version in his home state.  This law is not a right wing conservative assault on liberal tolerance.  The Los Angeles Times (also not a bastian of conservative thought) published an interesting turn-about piece today - what if a baker was asked to bake a cake with anti-gay slogans in the shape of a Bible with figures of two tuxedo'ed men holding hands and a large X in icing over the happy couple.  Does that baker have the right to refuse to bake that cake because it offends his deeply held belief in tolerance and his support for his own gay son?   Turning the case around feels different, doesn't it? http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-82618164/   The point I'm trying to make is that decrying the RFRA is not an anti-discrimination act - because by standing against the RFRA you are simply choosing to discriminate against one highly valued Right (religious liberty) instead of discriminating against another highly valued Right (marriage equality)."

Frat,30zals,RobinIsAGoodfellow,7,Wed Apr 1 02:12:19 2015 UTC,"Good point.  But deep religious conviction is just as unchangeable as orientation.  So because the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that gays can legally marry in Indiana, you think deeply religious people should be required to change their religion?  Surely not.  And Religious Liberty is directly enshrined in the US Constitution.  Marriage is never mentioned in the US Constitution; marriage was a matter left to the Church and to the States.  I don't know where the right balance is; but that's why we have courts, to weigh and balance competing Rights - and the RFRA gives religious people the right to make their case - not to win their case - but to make their case in defending themselves against a discrimination lawsuit."
Frat,30zals,RobinIsAGoodfellow,14,Wed Apr 1 02:22:11 2015 UTC,"Part of why this is such a big deal is because we've seen exactly how this plays out before. In the Civil Rights era racist shopkeepers used ""Religious liberty"" as a shield so they didn't have to serve black people. White people had the option of not being their patrons and going to ""integrated"" stores instead, but they didn't.   Under RFRA what if the owner of the only grocery store in town decides he doesn't want gay people in his business? What if a hospital's BoD votes that they will not accept gay patients? There's already been business owners who have come forward and said they will not serve gay customers; I'm not just giving you a thought exercise."
Frat,30zals,WoogysGO1602,3,Wed Apr 1 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point.  The segregationists of the 1950s and 1960s used religion as a shield to justify their intolerance.  The US Supreme Court settled the matter when Bob Jones University had its tax exempt status revoked by the IRS for racial discrimination and when Bob Jones Univ appealed to the US Supreme Court that its religion required it to keep the races separate.  The Warren Court ruled 8-1 against Bob Jones Univ by saying the government had a ""Compelling Interest' in protecting equal rights and ending segregation, and that because the government had a ""Compelling Interest,"" it could restrict a cherished 1st Amendment Freedom like religious liberty.  The current RFRA orders that the State government of Indiana must first find a ""Compelling Interest"" before it can be allowed to restrict religious liberty.    But did the segregationists have as much Biblical scripture to rely on as do the religious people who understand their religion to hold gay marriage as wrong?  Part of why this is becoming a big deal now, where the last 22 States to adopt RFRAs have seen no controversy, is a deliberate tactic on the part of SJWs to target small businesses that cannot likely afford big legal costs and who are thought to be owned by people of deep faith.    The idea is that by suing Main Street into submission, the SJW can compel widespread subservience to their beliefs.    In a recent wedding cake bakery case, the owner of the shop offered the couple any pre-made cake he had on display, that they could top off themselves with a double groom statue, but the couple refused.  The baker offered to have another baker bake their cake.  The couple refused.  It appeared that the whole point of the encounter was to trap the baker between his religious beliefs and a lawsuit.  Fraternities should particularly worry about the activities and tactics of the SJWs; religious objectors to gay marriage are not SJWs' only target; fraternities are clearly sighted in their cross-hairs as well.  Edited to Bold closing line"
Frat,30zals,phlipp,5,Wed Apr 1 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"You've made good points as well.    But did the segregationists have as much Biblical scripture to rely on as do the religious people who understand their religion to hold gay marriage as wrong?   In my opinion, yes. Though as with any religious issue much of it depends on interpretation, how much historical context you take into account, and whether or not you believe in Biblical literalism/infallibility.    Part of why this is becoming a big deal now, where the last 22 States to adopt RFRAs have seen no controversy, is a deliberate tactic on the part of SJWs to target small businesses that cannot likely afford big legal costs and who are thought to be owned by people of deep faith.   The difference with this bill is that businesses are explicitly not excluded (whereas all the other ones explicitly exclude private businesses). Literally no one wants to force churches to perform ceremonies they don't morally agree with; which is why not much of a fuss has been made of the other bills.   Personally I'd rather know if a business owner has bigoted views; I wouldn't want to shop there anyways but a lot of people simply would not have a choice."
Frat,30zals,nmhunate,2,Wed Apr 1 03:50:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you, kind sir.  The reason businesses are included in newer RFRA State laws, and not in earlier ones is Citizens United.  When the US Supreme Court held in Citizens United that corporations had free speech rights, the newer RFRA laws began to address that.  I think Main Street deserves as much Constitutional Protection as our Churches deserve.  And remember, nothing in RFRA prevents the SJWs from trying to order a wedding cake for a gay marriage, being refused, and then picketing that business until every shopper in town knows about the issue.  The fix for most things is more speech, not shutting down the ability to defend yourself."

It's not a perfect comparison - because as you point out, orientation is not chosen, and (very arguably) the desire for contraception and the desire for non-procreative sex is chosen.  But Hobby Lobby does show that the US Supreme Court holds religious liberty in higher stead than some other ""rights."""

Remaining members aren't accustomed to the change and/or have become complacent living in the shadow of ""power members"". Stuff slides, meetings aren't as productive, etc. then a new year starts, some people (like you) are frustrated. It takes a bit, but eventually there's enough frustration that you (and most likely others) have to take a stand and say enough is enough.   You need to voice your frustration. you need to challenge your brothers to be better. It's good that you've identified problems in the chapter at the moment, but it's no good if you're sitting back and only complaining about it. Hold yourself to the standard that International has set out for you to be. It's not going to be easy, but if you care about the fraternity and the values it encompasses you've got to at least try to steer the ship.  There's lots of ways of varying degrees of commitment, and not knowing you or your chapter dynamic some of the following suggestions may not be realistic.. but here goes:   Run for an exec position Reflect on the member that made the biggest impact a couple of years ago. Did they graduate? Try to contact them, ask for some advice. In fact try to reach out to alum in general. Be more vocal in meetings Find other like-minded guys and discuss with them how you can change suggest and/or take charge of running a new event Be an example, be a guy that others look up to. even if you aren't an exec, you don't necessarily have to be to be a role model.   At the very least once you graduate, you can honestly say that you gave 100% and can leave with no regrets. You'll have learned some valuable lessons, and will have stronger soft skills for your future career."

Frat,30yxso,nbucks21,2,Wed Apr 1 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure most people have said this about their chapter at some point.  If you're really worried, then stop tuning out during chapter meetings and start actually getting involved in them. Get a position for next semester, preferably an E-Board position, and make some fuckin moves. If you really care this much, then you'll do something about it."

Only thing you can really do is run for an exec position and try to push your agenda. Build an allegiance with the brothers that other brothers look up to and you'll see change.

Brothers of academic fraternities want to see if you want to be a member, so showing real interest the way you are expressing it to us will show them just that.  It isn't going to be easy to get to know everyone, so focus on a few who you really click with, and ask lots of questions. Take it one step at a time and you'll do just fine.   Academic fraternities and their PNMs have something in common that they know of before they even meet each other. In your case, it's engineering, so talk about engineering and see what they do together that pertains to engineering.   Most of all, relax, and enjoy getting to know the brothers of the fraternity."

The lawsuit alleges multiple incidents of low grade hazing (having to buy breakfast, running errands, keeping a pledge kit) but the lawsuit does not show how the allegations of low level hazing led to Hipps' death from a headfirst fall from the bridge over Lake Hartwell, striking his head on the riprap rocks in the shallow water below that part of the bridge.  Theories of a pledge dive off the bridge and a swim to a nearby beach seem unlikely because Hipps grew up on Lake Hartwell, had been boating under that same bridge thousands of times, and he would have known the shallow areas.  There were rumors that he was dangled by his ankles over the water and accidently dropped, but I have heard no evidence to support that.  Another rumor was that he was hot-dogging - jumping from one span of the bridge to another across a six foot gap - parkour style, and fell - but surely he would have yelled and drawn attention to the fall.  It's likely true that someone knows more than they have been willing to say publicly, but until real evidence is found or until real eyewitnesses come forward, this lawsuit is likely to bring a lot of heat without bringing a lot of light.  I feel for his family, for his pledge class (for which he was president), and for his fraternity (which was suspended by Clemson, but not, supposedly, for Hipps' death)."

This incident –however– does not reflect the danger of our area, but rather, the danger of drinking heavily in an unfamiliar place and losing track of your friends. Everyone on the row sends their condolences to this man's family, and I hope that issues like this will help prompt the American public to have a discussion about the drinking age and our drinking culture.

I wish she had answered more of her own questions, though what she suggested was good (a trained Pledge liaison whom overwhelmed Pledges can seek out, and who can advise Pledges if they have what it takes to make it through). It wasn't clear how she would decrease risk associated with hazing, or how she would carve out a hazing exception to State laws.  By the way, does anyone know whether State hazing laws apply to our Military Academies - and if State hazing laws do apply, how do the Academies justify the crucible nature of their first year for cadets?"
Frat,30totb,Impune,3,Mon Mar 30 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"By the way, does anyone know whether State hazing laws apply to our Military Academies - and if State hazing laws do apply, how do the Academies justify the crucible nature of their first year cadets?   I don't know, but here's an article from 1990 talking about the ""abolishment"" of hazing at West Point."
Frat,30totb,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  The detail in that article is helpful.  It seems that some form of what we would now call hazing persisted at West Point, though the Academy tried to end some of the most extreme examples."
Frat,30totb,Impune,2,Tue Mar 31 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. What I gleaned from it was that hazing at military academies illegal and frowned upon just as it is anywhere else, but that the culture/tradition is hard to change (just as it is in fraternities that haze), especially when tacitly supported by the administrators."
Frat,30totb,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Tue Mar 31 02:09:44 2015 UTC,"There was a remarkable book, ""Absolutely American,"" that followed the daily lives of the very first Class at West Point to graduate after 9/11.  The writer had full access to the Cadets for four years - from their plebe year to graduation - and he could write anything he chose.  Really a remarkable look at the men who were training to lead our Army.  Written about a decade after the West Point article you referenced, the culture of West Point was still what we envision - physical punishments for infractions, verbal dress-downs by upperclassmen.  The writer made the point that the class he followed seemed to him to be epic complainers and hedonists, but that they also seemed to be the happiest group of men he had ever encountered.  The fraternity culture we are all trying to protect - in its best form - seems to share a lot with the culture described in the book.  And that should not be a surprise.  The modern campus fraternity culture was crafted by veterans returning from WWII and using their GI Bill benefits to attend college.  Here's a review of the book by David Brooks of the NYT: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/huah.html"
Frat,30totb,Anna_Kendrick_Lamar,2,Tue Mar 31 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"I'm breaking this down to its simplest form but the military isn't really subject to those kind of state and fed laws since it's in the scope of their mission to be fit and disciplined for military service.  ""Hazing""  is illegal in the military  but everything done at boot camp or various recruit trainings does not fall under the same definition of hazing that fraternities follow"
Frat,30totb,TexasComments,4,Tue Mar 31 15:52:24 2015 UTC,"I attended a senior military college and was a pledge and later brother in a fraternity.   The corps of cadets at the university had an exemption for ""legitimate military training"" as defined by the military advisors (Vietnam-era enlisted and officer Marines for the most part.   There should be an exemption for a highly regulated basic training style pledgeship for a month or so where they are broken down and rebuilt. Hell just have one Vet per pledge class."

I've thought about the idea of how recent vets returning to campus should be sought-after candidates at Rush - how their more settled and disciplined constitution could serve as a role model within the fraternity and perhaps tamp down on excesses when the chapter is about to venture ""A Bridge Too Far.""   A pledgemaster who has himself been through the crucible of a military academy or corps of cadets would understand purposeful hazing, its benefits, and its limited scope."
Frat,30totb,TexasComments,2,Tue Mar 31 03:07:12 2015 UTC,... Look at Texas A&M Fish Drill Team specifically the reasoning for their formation and what they became over 40 years. You get the opposite effect.
Frat,30totb,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting example - a group isolated by a housing shortage from the hazing that was going on at the main campus - and that group - de novo - formed a culture of betterment and excellence.   What would you recommend fraternities do to protect and preserve a culture of betterment, excellence, and leadership and to forge a deep and lasting fraternal bond?"
Frat,30totb,TexasComments,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:41:20 2015 UTC,"If you want to use The Fish Drill Team as the example you are in for a harsh and rude awaking.   Lets start off first by correcting what you said - the freshmen were moved off campus because of hazing from WWII veterans who believed that they needed to be as tough and hard as them.   From there only a select few formed the drill team. There is your most important factor. Unit selection and formation or rather you need to pick very good pledges. You can only shape them so much without more than a week of hellweek.   From there lets move to the 1950's and 1960's where the nationals tournament was shut down because the Fish Drill Team won so many times in a row the USMC Drill Team literally stopped competing in drill meets. You need to hone what you are looking for and then hone your shaping methods.   I can tell your for a fact the following methods were used:   *Steam Shower PT: *  Arrive in Sweat pants and shirt with helmet on and black boots  Pushups, wall sits, flutter kicks, monkey fuckers, bows and toes, burpees, and literally any calisthenic you can think of would be performed in the group shower - at about 100* and 00% humidity until a freshmen passed out.   They would be removed and revived then everyone would go back in for another round.   Physical Correction:  Punching, kicking, beating, breaking of fingers with boots while doing pushups, slapping ect.   Running  Every week or so these guys whould go for a run out to a water tower about three miles from where they practiced and they would do so in starched uniforms, helmets, boots, gloves, and rifle or flag. At the watertower practice and hazing would occur as listed above and below and they would run back.   Punishment Runs   Wind Sprints as a group until someone passed out Asinine questions You can use these ""Freshmen X how many helmets are in the basement of my dorm"" Freshmen runs and finds out then reports back and if he is wrong or    you think he is rinse and repeat or choose another punishment from this list.  ""Which is Further"" You can use this one too ""Want to make a bet? I feel building A is closer than building B"" then two freshmen would sprint to ind out which was closer. Everyone wins more punishment from this list.    The sadistic stuff   I will not go into detail after the 60s because from there the hazing becomes quite separated from doing what is required for good order and discipline and truly criminal acts.    Bayonetting arms and slashing legs and torsos to make sure cadets would not flinch if they were cut by a bayonet during practices Holding a lighter to a freshmen's chin until it is lit on fire - after he flinched when you used it to burn a stray thread.    Breaking into rooms with sledgehammers and kidnapping a naked freshmen and duck-tape-mummy-wrapping them then beating and punch them and finally taping them up to a goal post - for saying a word they are not allowed to say.  Requiring new ""pledge trainers"" to demonstrate loyalty by cutting themselves with a knife across their pectoral.  After ""pledge trainers"" receive full training a 'blood cord' is cut into their left shoulder using alternating hatches and two circular lines so that they will always appear to have their cord on even without a uniform. No anesthetic, medical care or pain killer is given other than their hat to bite on.    You can use similar tools to build a great organization but you need to know where hard limits are and you need proper supervision.  The SEALs training platoon at the same university trains with an EMT team following them and when they swim they have half a dozen guards with them because they have lost cadets before."
Frat,30trra,drummer-boy,12,Mon Mar 30 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the mood of the party. Are people trying to just chill and mingle or is everyone trying to dance and get drunk. The party dj should be able to follow the beat of the party and know when to play songs that reflect that. They should also have a pretty broad music taste. For example don't put the guy that only likes hardcore Oakland beats on music control.  With that being said, when everyone is dancing and drinking I like to play trap remixes of newer popular rap songs that way it's something new while still giving that feeling that you know the song. Don't go play some brand new shit from some small artist that only you and a buddy will know. For chill nights I have an extremely good blink 182 playlist that will make you reminisce on the glory days.

Look at the geedstars in action:    Fraternities are a relic of the past and should be shut down. Their primary function is to compartmentalize socializing into smaller groups and cliques of like-minded people. We see it in urban life as the forming of rich white neighborhoods, Chinatown, Little India, the black neighborhoods, etc. It doesn't promote social exchange and interaction, it prevents it.   Fraternities can say that they do charity and all that other stuff, but that's just side stuff done in an effort to justify their existence.    These kids will have the rest of their lives to be as socially compartmentalized as they want. And you know what? If you want to form a fraternity, go ahead. Do it off campus, off university grounds. Its a free country. There is no law that says that any university MUST allow you to form any OFFICIAL university recognized institution.    Fraternities are stupid."

It was a pain in the ass because we couldn't go out through the window to unhook them, so after about 30 minutes of frustration and emails to professors about missing classes, one of the guys had to call his girlfriend to come over with scissors and cut them off the doors. Man was I fuckin' pissed, but it was a great prank."

If I saw you at the party over the weekend but you bitch about not having time to study during hell week a couple days after, you're shit out of luck.  In regards to studying for a test, you should be studying all semester and attempting to retain the knowledge you've acquired.

Frat,30jcpb,YJ87,8,Fri Mar 27 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"His actions were wrong but those are pretty harsh charges considering what he did.   It seems like a pretty straight forward investigation and indictment. You can't hang a noose and Confederate-era flag on a statue of a black student and then be like, ""lol jus kiddin' I love the darkies! it's a joke (satire, amiright, guise?), obvi.""  Racist intimidation tactics aren't cool and they're not a joke. Don't try to apologize for it or make it seem like it's not a big deal. It is a big deal, and this kid will now get to face a jury of his peers and answer for his backward thinking and actions."
Frat,30jcpb,Impune,7,Fri Mar 27 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"The prosecutors will have the burden to show the student's subjective intent to intimidate a small group of individuals. The act itself cannot serve as prima facie evidence and shift the burden. According to Virginia v. Black, a 2002 case which held an anti-cross burning statute unconstitutional, only ""true threats"" are proscribable.  ""'True threats' encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.""  Without more to go on, I think prosecutors will have a hard time showing an actual intent to intimidate, and accurately defining the individual or group of individuals he meant to intimidate. I think this is one of the rare cases where the defendant (as despicable as he is) has the stronger legal and factual argument."
Frat,30jcpb,djgoff1983,2,Fri Mar 27 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement with you. I, however, think the indictment was just -- I don't think it was ""harsh"" by any means.  Whether he'll actually be found guilty is an entirely different discussion."
Frat,30jcpb,Impune,2,Fri Mar 27 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Again, Freedom of Speech is difficult - because the ONLY speech which needs protecting is offensive speech.  But I would rather tolerate offensive speech from idiots, than allow my government (i.e. Ole Miss) to decide what is accepted speech and what is prohibited speech.  I was under the impression that for speech to cross the line to an unprotected ""True Threat,"" the threat must be directly focused on individuals, and must be immediate.  The concept is illustrated by a Klansman burning a cross on his own farm as opposed to a Klansman burning a cross on a black family's front lawn.  The former is protected by the First Amendment as Free Speech.  The latter is a direct and immediate threat against individuals.  As someone else mentioned in this thread, if the noose had been nailed to a black student's dorm door, then the case of a true threat would have more merit."
Frat,30jcpb,RobinIsAGoodfellow,4,Fri Mar 27 23:35:53 2015 UTC,Racism and offensiveness aren't illegal.   The difference between this and burning a cross at a black church is that that istargeted to an individual group and has more of an implicit threat. The statue wasn't permanently defaced either.   Even if he is convicted I think he will win on appeal.   >answer for his backward thinking  Being a racist asshole isn't a crime  It would be different if someone put a noose on like a black student's door.

I think targeting a statue of the first black student ever to be admitted in that school with a noose, something which has a very significant implication to black people in American history, is just as targeted and implicit a threat.

Had this happened in say, Wisconsin, I think I would agree more with your sentiment, but it would be disingenuous to not take into account the sordid past Mississippi and Ole Miss have when considering this case.   Also from the standpoint of university officials and law enforcement they MUST interpret that action as nothing but a threat.  As far as they knew these people were as deranged as the Tsarnaev brothers and this was just a prelude to actual violence.

Shouldn't we each be judged (and recruited) by the ""content of our character and not by the color of our skin""?  I prefer a meritocracy over an inevitable quota system.

Frat,30emoq,RobinIsAGoodfellow,33,Thu Mar 26 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"All hazing is illegal, but there is a difference between purposeful hazing designed to inculcate an important lesson - and purposeless torture.  This is torture that serves no purpose other than the sadistic gratification of the torturers.    This sadistic process ingrains no new knowledge in the pledge (like quickly reciting the Greek alphabet, or memorizing fraternity and chapter history, or learning brothers' bios).  The process does not strengthen the pledges physically, mentally, or emotionally (like morning runs, pushups, or lineups).  This sadistic process does not make the pledges better men.  Instead this torture weakens the pledges nutritionally and emotionally, and sows the seeds of deep resentment.  While torture may bond the pledge class together and test their desire to join the fraternity, the intended bonding of a pledge class is ideally forged by the pledge class struggling against  surmountable challenges, and overcoming all challenges together in the end - earning a well deserved and difficult triumph that all pledges share in and bond around.  That positive bond is then easily transformed at initiation into a broader bond with the entire chapter.  The bond forged by purposeless sadistic torture may bond the pledges together - but it bonds them together AGAINST the actives, and it creates frictional cliques within the fraternity.  This is sadistic torture, and I challenge anyone to show how it can create a fraternal bond to the chapter."

The closure is the result of an investigation into derogatory comments and quotes found in a private journal misplaced in a local restaurant.  In conjunction with this action, NC State University today also revoked recognition of the Tau Chapter as a student organization.   Sounds like there was a mutual decision between the parties to close it."
Frat,30aruc,Vantius,5,Wed Mar 25 21:44:37 2015 UTC,From our school paper. http://www.technicianonline.com/news/article_077408c6-d32e-11e4-b7b9-73130f327818.html
Frat,30aruc,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"So it appears both Pi Kappa Phi and NCSU are claiming they closed the chapter. The reason this may be important - once again - is that NCSU is a State University, and punishing the content of a private journal is a pretty flagrant violation of the 1st Amendment - government (i.e. NCSU) may not do that.  Now Pi Kappa Phi can close their chapter, but I don't think NCSU can even ask them to do that.  Only if Pi Kappa Phi acted completely independently of NCSU and its rather clueless Chancellor would the punishment be legal."
Frat,30aruc,RobinIsAGoodfellow,4,Wed Mar 25 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"I've seen these kinds of arguments before, but I'm not convinced. My concern is that the journal's content will be deemed a violation of the school's Code of Conduct, or whatever it's officially called at NC State, and that's what got the individual (and their organization) in trouble with the university. The 1st Amendment only protects citizens from government entities and prosecution, not punishments for violating a school's Code of Conduct like is probably the case here. I would need more specifics about the reason they were kicked off, but my intuition tells me it was that and so not a 1st Amendment issue."
Frat,30aruc,RobinIsAGoodfellow,3,Wed Mar 25 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Just as in the long tortured thread about the 1st Amendment and the OU case, NCSU is a State University, chartered by, built by, and owned by all the citizens of the great State of North Carolina.  NCSU is absolutely a government entity restrained by the 1st Amendment.  It actually doesn't matter what NCSU's Code of Conduct is, or whether every brother at Pi Kappa Phi signed that Code of Conduct - because a government entity may not require you to sign away your 1st Amendment rights - and illegal contracts (if you consider the Code of Conduct to be a contract) cannot be enforced.  What I'm unsure of is whether NCSU's Chancellor can ask Pi Kappa Phi's Nationals to close the chapter.  I don't know whether that request, if it happened, is illegal."

Frat,30aruc,Vantius,2,Wed Mar 25 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"Read through the OU thread - there are court cases and 1st Amendment attorneys' opinions there - even including a begrudging agreement by the ACLU  http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/2yx72c/sae_at_ou_has_hired_stephen_jones_to_file_a/   Oh, and revealing State Secrets - as in the military - has been held by the Courts as NOT protected by the 1st Amendment."

They look for Greek controversies on other campuses halfway across the country, and then say, ""See!

It's like, ""A fraternity at Texas A&M did XYZ. We think fraternities at This University are capable of the same thing."" Totally baseless and unfounded fear mongering.  And of course, then when parents and students Google ""Greek Life at This University"" what is the first thing they see? An article with the title ""This University, Fraternities, and Rape Culture"" that has absolutely nothing to do with our Greek community.

When it comes to grades I think it is important to note two things: 1) i you're a good student you'll do good whether you're in a fraternity or not and 2) first semester freshmen year is, statistically speaking, a students worst semester GPA wise. That is because they're still getting used to their new life and learning how to adapt to the collegiate world. In my fraternity we place a huge importance on grades and have mandatory library hours for pledges.

Colleges and Nationals need to adopt policies that clearly state they will take no retaliatory action against Chapters or individuals when members or guests are taken for medical treatment.  Both New Jersey (where Rutgers is located) and Virginia (where SigEp is HQed) have medical amnesty laws.  The Gordie's Call Foundation is located in the same freaking state as Sig Ep's Nationals, and they've been all over the news in the last month pushing the Virginia legislature and Governor to enact Virginia's new medical amnesty law.  Neither Rutgers nor SigEp Nationals has any excuse for ignorance of medical amnesty.  Stop incentivizing couch medicine by risk managers - they're not paramedics and not doctors. Colleges and Nationals that set bad precedents such as this will have blood on their hands. If the hospital or the doctor contacted Rutgers, the student should sue the hospital and the doctor for HIPPA violations."

So, I heard that you may have picked up a video of me falling out of a pickup truck. I would appreciate if you didn’t post it and I’ll tell you why.  Number one, I was blackout as fuck (obviously) and those guys just started picking a fight with me because (apparently) I was acting like I was going to take one of their beers. Look at the video. I’m a skinny drunk as fuck white kid and they’re a large group of Spurs fans. They could kick my ass so easily it’s not even fair. So they’re just starting a fight with me for really no reason.  My false bravado can only be attributed to liquid courage and my sense of humor. I obviously had no intentions of fighting them, but if they’re going to kick my ass I’m sure gonna fuck with them.  Then there’s the matter of the truck. I hop in the back of this random truck cause I thought it would be a funny getaway, dude floors it to knock me off. And to top it all off, they trip me.  So I guess that was all excuses for why I didn’t deserve to be that injured, and also I think this video is just another reason to shit on Greek life (as I’m wearing a sorority tank) when really the assholes are the Spurs fans.  Anyways, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t post it, but if you really want to at least give me some dignity.

Frat,306xlv,VERTlGO,14,Wed Mar 25 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"The doctor or hospital notifying the college would be a serious HIPPA violation, punishable by fines to $50K - even if the doctor and hospital were Dartmouth affiliated.  The only exception I can think of would be if the pledge was under 18 and the doctor considered the branding to be child abuse - but then the doctor's obligation would be to report the case to law enforcement - not to the college.  And since the article reports the pledge was a sophomore, it's unlikely a sophomore was under 18.    On the other hand, New Hampshire state law REQUIRES reporting of hazing by anyone with knowledge of the hazing to law enforcement or to the school. http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxii/631/631-7.htm  So the doctor may have felt obligated to report the branding to the college.  But, while I am not an attorney, I think Federal Law (HIPPA) trumps state law (mandatory hazing reporting) and so the report to the college was illegal."

Frat,306xlv,BathSaltsrFun,8,Thu Mar 26 07:19:06 2015 UTC,"You are right that branding in the NPHC fraternities are not nearly as news worthy. The reason for that is partly because branding is so common among some of those fraternities. The fraternity you used for example was Omega Psi Phi from what i understand only brothers have the opportunity to get branded not pledges. There is a huge gray area when it comes to things like this. Would it be considered hazing if you and your brothers all decided to get matching tattoos after you completed the membership intake process? It would seem as long as you were compelled upon your own accord there would be no problem with this.   This is not KA first time getting dinged. They have been caught doing asinine things in the past and bringing negative attention to the fraternity. I agree that it is easier for KA to garner that attention mostly because their university's president is a brother. He has to be heavy handed because anything else would look like he condones the behavior. If any fraternity repeatedly brings heat to it's chapter and, also has leadership working at  the university as brothers they will make the news. I don't believe that it would matter if it was an IFC or NPHC fraternity."
Frat,306xlv,Studmuffin26,6,Wed Mar 25 12:09:03 2015 UTC,"Youre right that it is more notable that it happened to a pledge. I think that branding pledges is pretty barbaric. However, even if the NPHC fraternities did brand pledges - and to my understanding the hazing in NPHC fraternities does tend to be worse, you still wouldn't hear about it. Doesn't fit the fearmongering narrative about all IFC brothers being haze-happy racist rapists.   And though I might tend to agree about many KA chapters deserving their rep, this is Alpha Delta, a Dartmouth-specific organization, not KA. Either way I do understand why the school is forced to punish them after these incidents are brought to their attention. It would serve us if the whole community made an effort to quit doing stupid shit that reflects badly on everyone else."

If someone reports, ""frat rapes girl"" the post will get reposted 100,000 times and the reputation of the whole university is sullied. 6 months later when the charges are dropped that article might get reposted by 25% of the accused chapter's members. The reputation is still sullied.  The university has a responsibility to its entire alumni, faculty and student base to maintain a positive reputation. If over reacting and punishing Greek life can save face it makes smart business sense to do so. Nobody wants to be known as the college who's ""easy on rape"".  Is it fair? No. Is life always fair? No.  Complaining about the way multi million dollar organizations conduct its business isn't going to accomplish much. Do your best do avoid dangerous situations. Educate your young men on potential issues moving forward. Learn from the mistakes of others. Grow into productive upstanding members of society.

The problem is now they don't want any part of the shit slinging to land on them, so they are careful to avoid saying anything else that will be misinterpreted and used against them in the court of public opinion.   The problem is that they're unwilling to admit that it's false because they don't want to be in the news tomorrow as rape apologists or deniers. I get where they're coming from but this whole situation is really fucked up from a social justice perspective.   Especially when Sabrina Ruben Erdely can write a sensationalist piece of slanderous bullshit with millions of readers and not be held accountable for doing her damned best to ruin the lives of several young men on the basis of hearsay from one person.

Assuming you know sorority girls (that's the starting point, be friends with at least one), grab 8-10 of your guys and get an equal number (I have faith in you OP) of their girls and do small little fun things. Small little things multiple times leads to more girls vouching for your chapter for larger big socials.   That, and throw good house parties. My chapter a few years ago was kinda small and we decided to really step up our party game (lots of punch, bought a sound system, had a brother who could DJ kinda, lights, etc $$$) and people started talking about us more. Now, good parties don't mean you suddenly get lots of guys to join, but the buzz around campus helps. It costed our personal pockets quite a bit, but the difference was felt within two years.

Can someone explain why they're including these people? If this is to be an objective, honest, and fair review, why include people whose defining characteristic is that they're anti-Greek life?  I understand that the university is trying to be representative of the student body and include all stakeholders, but that seems to be beyond the pale. Asking students to be the committee should be a given; asking students to be on the committee simply because they hate the thing they'll be evaluating sounds like a recipe for disaster and partisanship.  Some might say, ""But they're including Greek students and representatives on the committee, therefore it's only fair to represent the 'other side'."" And to this I say: bull. shit. Having Greeks, be they national representatives or local chapter leaders, makes sense because these individuals have an incentive to investigate ways to improve the system so they don't all get kicked off campus; they have a vested interest in improving relations with the campus and administration.

""Ah, such a beautiful day"" he thinks to himself, then grins and longboards down the quad.   His shifty eyes spot a beautiful brunette sitting beneath a tree, wearing a jacket with the words ""Kappa Delta"" poring over her history textbook. A sorority girl! She's sitting with another boy, remarkably tall with a normal sized forehead.   Maher falls off his longboard due to infatuation. What a gorgeous girl! He remembers what his dad said to him before shaking his hand and leaving him for good back in August.  ""Son, be confident, and all the girls in the world can be yours""  He approaches the mystery girl. But what to use as a pickup line! It has to be relevant and witty!  ""Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you're in the Kappa Delta sorority.""  The girl glances around before replying ""uh, yeah.""  ""I was wondering, uh, if you wanted to go to the woman's rights rally later this afternoon. Should be a good time!"" Brilliant! That's the key to a girls heart--girls love woman's rights!  ""Sorry, I should get back to studying.""  The tall, boy rolls over from his stomach and reveals a tee shirt with the greek letters ""Sigma Chi"".   ""Sorry man. Have a radical rest of your day though, we have a lot to get done today"" he winks at the girl.  Maher is enraged! What kind of man treats a woman in such a manner? Perhaps one day he will have a visual media platform to vent his frustrations stemming from a single moment in his lifetime to create sweeping generalizations about a group of people furthering themselves professionally and socially.  He longboards away, tears streaming down his face."

Does anyone else notice that he doesn't use any examples in his claims? For example he calls fraternities a cult, that they strip you of your personality, etc. but never gives a specific example. As well as the example of death. There are far more students who commit suicide that are non affiliated in my school than whose that passed during pledging and took their own life as a Greek combined. Finally, I have to mention his multiple references to homosexuality in this video. Personally, I have seen that being in a fraternity allows you to be yourself more than any other situation. Although I am straight, I have about 50 brothers who I consider as close as family and I know they feel the same. 3 of my brothers have come out of the closet because they feel safe within our brotherhood. Does living with other men imply that you are gay, or that being gay is a joke, like ""sticking carrots up your ass""? I don't know. Obviously I'm preaching to the choir here, because we are all fraternity men. We shouldn't allow the actions of the few impact our image, because if that were true of all groups imagine how cruel every organization would seem. Don't let idiots like this get to you. In the end, Bill Maher is just trying to make money by riling up a crowd. We are above this."

The polemic she writes makes no attempt to engage members of fraternity life, and instead screams aloud in the echo chamber that is VICE and scolds all men associated with fraternities based on a non-empirical, selectively sampled data set.  This article does a great job in allowing the author to vent. Otherwise, it is patronizing and ostentatious.

A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.  A hyperlink has an anchor, which is the location within a certain type of a document from which the hyperlink can be followed only from the homepage. The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source code document. For example, in an online reference work such as Wikipedia, many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms, such as tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, letters, and glossaries.

Frat,2zswp6,orangechicken21,2,Sat Mar 21 16:42:07 2015 UTC,"That's a great point. Hazing-type traditions can act as a ""buy-in"" for pledges if done within reason. This buy in can make new members feel more invested in the fraternity and become more active. What's important is that the fraternity needs to be worth the ""buy-in"" or it will not work. This means socials/mixers, formals, academic support, a good general reputation and a strong brotherhood.  Conversely, I've noticed that within my recently rechartering chapter, the decision not to haze has caused a certain sense of entitlement among new members. They're not used to putting in time and effort into the success of the chapter, and I already see the comrodery and quality of leadership declining."

You were recruited because someone thought you had the good sense and leadership not to crash your new fraternity into the ground, don't prove them wrong.

Use your fucking head, dude. Hazing was ""cool"" post-WWII, hit its peak in the 80's, and is now slowly but surely killing the chapters that continue to do it.  You just founded a Chapter.

In addition to what other commenters have said (plight of Greek life nationwide and hazing precedent), you are certainly in the spotlight from your nationals right now. They have given your chapter the opportunity to colonize again and are going to be very critical of you in your fist couple of years as you restart chapter operations. If you slip up in any way in your first years as a recolonized chapter, it's not going to be good- it sends the message that your chapter has reverted to the ways it operated when you got your charter revoked 30 years ago (and I'm assuming it was for a big incident, or a chain of incidences).   That being said, if your chapter finds it suitable to haze or whatever, I think it goes without saying to ease into the tradition. Pledges WILL figure out that they got hazed harder than their big brothers if you go about this full-steam-ahead, and it will inevitably form a divide within classes. My chapter was recolonized as a dry chapter and It wasn't until a decade later that drinking and pledge tasks became more difficult.

Like IrrIrr said, it's mostly going to effect socialization and communication. Both of those things don't seem to be causing much of an issue. My best friend growing up had A.S and he was the coolest guy I'd ever met. Just wish people weren't so quick to judge him. He was smarter than I was and was always an attention whore.

It was so bad many of the brothers wouldn't vote to give me a bid because they thought I was weird, awkward, and had a broken leg at the time so I couldn't play sports. Luckly I was voted in by only a few votes in a large chapter. I was aware that I was awkward and I was a huge try hard as a pledge. I bought Costa sunglasses, Southern Tide, Wranglers, Cowboy boots, Chubbies, Sperrys, Chacos etc. to compensate for how awkward I was.

Frat,2zl9hy,DrBaus,41,Fri Mar 20 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"Any REAL reason to be worried?   Yes. A photograph was distributed to strangers and friends across the country and it cost her her job. She could very likely sue the shit out of you, as I'm assuming it was a private photo -- not one that you paid her for the rights to distribute widely.   Even if you were happy for a naked photo to be taken - or took it yourself, it's illegal to post or share it without your permission.   You could be in violation of privacy, harassment, cyberbullying, obscenity, and disorderly conduct laws. I hope you're not in New Jersey, because if found culpable you'd face 5+ years in prison and $30,000+ in fines.   Ever since ""The Fappening"" states have been pushing to enact stricter legislation about the sharing of nude photos that don't ""belong"" to them. These laws are aimed mostly at ""revenge porn,"" but might also apply to cases such as this.  If you're lucky she won't pursue it. She'll just kick herself for trusting a fraternity with a picture of her topless and probably never speak to you guys again. Let this be a lesson learned to be much more careful in the future. Don't include your school name on future rush tit photos (preserve plausible deniability), and never show the girl's face (yes, you want to brag and show boobs, but you can at least not ruin her career over it).  EDIT: The chapter currently embroiled in the scandal over putting pictures of nude girls in a private Facebook group is potentially going to be brought up on charges of harassment and invasion of privacy."

Frat,2zltvm,tgamm,10,Thu Mar 19 18:53:50 2015 UTC,Make sure you block every entrance to the house except one. Preferably the back door if you have one. Have a sober person watching that door at all times to monitor who gets in and out. Also make sure no one leaves with alcohol with them. Cover any windows with sheets so nobody can see inside. Lastly dont give public access to alcohol. Keep it behind a bar and have bartenders serve all night. This prevents people from stealing your shit and also prevents shitheads from chugging half a bottle of fireball at your house and dying of alcohol poisoning
Frat,2zltvm,DasJarnold,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:46:51 2015 UTC,To add to yours If you allow under age people don't forget to have your sober rep mark people that can or can't drink. A back door is good for an entrance. Doing anything to prevent people from being seen in front of the house when a cop would drive by is always good. Most of all don't be a dick if cops show up. Have sober person talk to them outside the house with the door closed behind them and just be respectful. No sir we are not serving minors and yes sir we will turn the music down.

Your campus police may need probable cause to enter your fraternity house and you may have no obligation to permit them entry if they do not have a warrant or probable cause.  You should also consult your lease agreement for the new house and see if there is a ""quiet enjoyment"" clause - if there is not such a clause, you should insist on one.

Hopefully USC doesn't take an approach as draconian as my university, but hopefully your Greek system can make changes to prevent something like this from ever happening again.  Some things to consider, that my IFC is looking to implement:   Having Greeks from other chapters check up on parties, to make sure they are safe.   This keeps university police or anyone you really don't want to deal with from coming into your parties, but has the same effects of keeping things safe.   Require that parties have clearly marked water distribution and non-salty snacks for all participants   This can help prevent alcohol poisoning, like the event that occurred last night.   Push for your local law enforcement to create an alcohol and drug amnesty policy, where anyone trying to get help for their friend in need is immune from prosecution for public intoxication, underage drinking, etc.   Students are apprehensive to call 911 when someone is possibly in need, due to fear that they could get in trouble.  This can cost lives.  A policy like this can only save lives."

In my experience, the thing that makes us hesitate calling 911 is the financial burden of the person in question, or even not wanting them to get in trouble. Additionally, although you may not get in trouble legally, your chapter (atleast on our campus) will still probably get in trouble from either the University or IFC themselves.  Although definitely a good first step, making a Good Samaritan law won't remove the other stigma's of calling the ambulance."

At WVU, the IFC president signed off on a moratorium of all Greek life, with no consultation of IFC Exec or member chapters.  This was a horrendous move, but made the school's actions perfectly legal.

Of course a lot of our chapters are still killing it at their respective schools, but these might be the same schools where it's cool to sing stupid racist chants –so that's not even cool anyway.  You need to remember that the only people still working for a fraternity after graduating are fucking weirdos at the end of the day. A house really comes down to the school and the people, and everyday it seems like being nationally being affiliated with these racist fuckboys everywhere is just really not worth the perks of having an running into some random SAE and being like ""broooo.""  Plus new members are going to be soft as fuck because this whole ""no pledge-but pledge"" shit is actually something that can get a charter revoked."

Frat,2zj5xe,themistoclesV,2,Thu Mar 19 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"They're supposed to as per the True Gentlemen Experience. First full year since it's induction.  For every member they're supposed to look at a few things. If you completed all modules given your year, if you completed 10+ hrs of service, minimum 2.5gpa, if your dues are paid, and if you meet attendance standards (75% chapter meetings and 90% ritual activities). These are all just the base national standards in the TGE.  Based on that stuff you either stay good standing, bad standing, suspended, or expelled from what I gather. They take it all into account though, and sit down with you if needed, so it's not like if you only did 9 service hours you're totally fucked."

And our province officers officers have to do that for every chapter under them.  Also, you have to of had programming for members to complete all their TGE model requirements throughout the year, which is a ton of work on both officers and the general members.

You get a lot of shitty members when nationals pressures you into expanding without vetting.

Frat,2zhed5,DTOM827,9,Wed Mar 18 19:17:00 2015 UTC,I think a big problem is nationals pushing chapter's for numbers. There is nothing wrong with a smaller chapter but they just want to give out as many bids as humanly possible.

Frat,2zhed5,cootershooter420,7,Thu Mar 19 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"I think that fraternities in general are too strong to die right now. I have a hard time seeing them die -ever-, but who knows what'll happen in a thousand years.  Fraternities will morph and change to adapt to the social climate and the chapters that refuse will get killed off. When the huge women's rights movement was happening, legislation was pushed to open up gender-restrictive clubs to be co-ed (making it illegal for country clubs or whatever be restrictive). Fraternities and Sororities were granted special exceptions to this law (due to a few fraternity men in politics pushing for it hard) and I remember our nationals talking about how great it was that the law got passed. I remember thinking ""yeah, I get why that was important but I doubt it would have all came crashing down if we opened it up."" Don't get me wrong, I vastly prefer my fraternity being male-only, but I think fraternities are a lot stronger than people think - just because we have to change doesn't mean we won't survive or thrive.  On my campus, fraternities were secret societies for a while. The school tried to crack down on them and they went underground. Members stood up against the administration and eventually got recognized.  Are they in a decline? Depends on what you mean. Fraternities are in a state of change - they need to learn how to use social media safely, how to approach things in a world of constant monitoring, and adjust to the new world we're living in. Facebook has been open for only 11 years and the world is getting more connected. Shit's gotta change in each chapter to handle these new risks.  Chapters who try and do the same-old shit will probably die. Those who adapt will keep on. Fraternities will survive as a whole but don't expect them to be the same. Honestly they probably shouldn't be the same - as much as I love my chapter and my fraternity,  there's a lot that could use a change.  Basic principles - Support your brothers, support your community, and defend your chapter from people (admins and brothers alike) who will kill it."
Frat,2zhed5,Lodur,3,Wed Mar 18 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this, but you have to realize that politicians who have helped fraternities are all getting older. When most of the Greek politicians were in college, Fraternities were mostly all wealthy white kids. Hell, many schools were still segregated. Do you know the stats about how x pecentage of congress was involved in a fraternity or sorority? That  moreso has to do with them being privileged and have the time/money to devote. I'm not saying that it didn't help them out along the way, and I'm definitely not trying to say that they wouldn't be where they are now without their fraternity, but their upbringing had a lot to do with it. The demographics of the average lawmaker are changing as well, so don't count on people in Washington to always be there for Fraternities."
Frat,2zhed5,Lodur,2,Wed Mar 18 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"True, but I think it'll be a hard fight for people to outlaw all fraternities. So many people are involved and while fewer are politicians, there's always going to be a large enough amount who hopefully will defend them from being outright banned."
Frat,2zhed5,DTOM827,13,Wed Mar 18 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"I think we are going to see the slow decline of Greek life as we know it. I see a lot of schools starting to implement policies that are too strict for fraternities to operate without jumping through a ton of hoops. I don't think they'll completely  die out but I think on campus greek housing will be done away with (which WILL hurt brotherhood, idc how much you and your brothers like eachother if you don't have a house, it matters). The post yesterday about the university being a police state is how I see many schools acting toward fraternities in the next 20-30 years"

High schoolers don't understand that a lot of that stuff is just a joke. They take it at face value, and it becomes the frat bible to them. This has created a subculture of potential pledges who think they have to act like fuckboy try hards in order to fit in. Unfortunately this leads to drinking and drug use to the point of stupidity, over the top hazing, and just generally dumb decisions. Most of us have been guilty of this behavior at some point in time, but recently it seems to be worse than normal."

It's major cleanup time for Greek life, and hopefully we will end up better off for it.  As an aside, if schools decide that they want to do away with the whole thing (they won't, but let's imagine) and scrap everyone, fraternities will just become secret societies again. They'll operate the same as before, with no form of oversight from the university. Or the schools can keep them under their wing, continue to supervise them, and have their Greek offices work with them on meaningful reforms. What's better?"

Get rid of the parades, not enough. Now getting rid of the dresses won't be enough-in a few years the events themselves will be done away with. And maybe a few years after that, the fraternities' very existence will be deemed ""too offensive"".

Frat,2zjyh9,CigBreak,3,Thu Mar 19 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"The impetus for the frat chant was the same. It’s like drawing a penis on a passed out guy. Politically correct liberals have made racism so taboo, it’s freeing to joke about it when you’re drunk and partying with a member’s only group.   I disagree. The video of their house mother rapping along to a song with language some would consider inappropriate is not the same thing as a bunch of guys singing a racist chant.   Also, drawing a dick on a passed out guy is (forgive the pun) a dick move. It's juvenile and immature and can be hurtful, even if the people doing it didn't mean it that way.  I think the author makes a good point when it comes to the n-word being used in rap music and how there's a strain between whether or not it's okay for white people to repeat it (an awkward double standard certainly exists there), but trying to equate singing a rap song with singing a racist song is conflating two very different things.   This author seems to lack the ability to understand nuance. Not all lyrics with the word ""nigger"" in it are created equal."

And you also seem woefully misinformed about what it takes to get a successful fraternity off the ground. It takes a lot of time and handwork to found a chapter. A lot.  I don't mean to sound like a dick, but you don't really seem suited for the responsibility at hand.

Some fraternities have no actual pledge process (bid then initiate); in this case, look into starting a different fraternity. Otherwise, every fraternity is ""anti hazing"" but most agree that a non-hazing Pledge Process should be required to let a new member wear their letters (and it should). I know my nationals provides an 8 week ""model program"" with room and guidelines for adding in more events. Some of our chapters ignore this and haze hard as shit; I'm sure there are some that follow it to the letter. IMO 5 weeks is a VERY short process."

Every chapter is different, and you as an individual will have a different experience within whatever chapter you might end up joining based on your personality and how you mesh with everyone else, how invested you are in seeing your chapter succeed, etc.  The most important thing I try to impart on people looking to join a fraternity that if you're just looking to fuck around and party when convenient, don't join. Believe it or not being a member does require a bit of time and effort. It can be a highly rewarding experience, but as with most things in life you'll only get out what you put in."

Fuck, at my school there are fraternities for kids who work out and play Intramurals every night of the week and there are fraternities for kids who ride longboards and spend most of their time playing Dungeons and Dragons. I know this might seem a little biased but I've never met anyone who pledged and regretted it. If you find out you don't like it, you can always just drop. At the very least, go out to rush week and see if you find any guys you like. I promise that we talk to so many different people during rush week that nobody is going to think badly of you if you decide not to pledge or don't get a bid or something. Good luck"

Honestly, if you fit in well with most of the guys, you will probably get a bid. If you don't get a bid, it's probably a good thing because you wouldn't want to spend a ton of time around guys who you dont get along with very well."
Frat,2zfpxu,CigBreak,2,Wed Mar 18 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"7 year student, pledged my 4th year spring. Small campus, tight knit greek life. I'm an extreme outlier.   I initially only rushed one house, had a bid, didn't have grades to pick up. After getting to know all the guys over a semester I realized it wasn't the place for me, so I rushed every other house. Ended up finding a small local with great guys and extremely small membership. It was a chance to quickly assume leadership roles and grow myself.   While pledging I was a huge goober. As in TFM fail friday level. The older guys showed me the error of my ways and helped me grow. I finished pledging solo (other guys quit). It taught me that I can do anything I put my mind to and with my brothers I'm unstoppable.   If you come to a decision and pick a house, do not stand up for potentially dangerous hazing or do anything against your will. This is for your safety and the house's. College guys have some of the best and worst ideas in the world. Don't stand for what you don't believe in."

Frat,2zfpxu,samhudson333,1 point,Wed Mar 18 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"I already knew many Greeks across campus due to rushing for a full year before pledging. The biggest changes were learning all of the finer points of growing up that I missed by going solo for so long. I butted heads with the higher pin members, did what I thought was right while ignoring guidence, etc.   Joining a house on the rocks was a tough situation that made me learn quickly. Things sucked, but having my outside opinion brought some fresh ideas that members who joined as freshman would have never come up with. My connections with other houses also improved relations with them.   TL:DR; It's not better or worse, just different."

While, many of those things do happen in my chapter, it definitely doesn't represent the full chapter.  Since I joined a fraternity, I transferred campuses. I didn't transfer because of my fraternity or the brothers, I transferred because of my major.   I still talk to the guys from my old school, because I'm still really good friends with them and they are my brothers.  I have made new bonds with the brothers I have now.    On the social side, the party/bar scene is way better, I date/talk to hotter girls, and have a better network of people to go to if something goes wrong, or I need help with something.   Overall, my fraternity experience has been great, and I definitely do not regret it.   If you're asking this question to gauge whether or not you should join, I would say go for it. It's a fun time, and the old saying goes ""you get what you put into it."" While it's not a black and white statement, it definitely has some truth. If you're one of those guys who doesn't show up to anything and just wants to drink, well thats the experience you will get. If you want to be on an exec board or stay involved, thats the experience you will get."

Don't get me wrong, Im not saying my fraternity is the best, Im comparing Greek Life to other non greek related clubs (business club, honors society, SGA etc.) Only one other user on here knows what specific chapter I'm from anyways, so it's not like I'm doing this for some sort of appraisal from my Nationals.

It's a lot of small talk (e.g., where are you from, what's your major, etc.) that should ultimately culminate in getting to know the person who's rushing you better and, by extension, the chapter as a whole. This could mean getting invited back to a party, another rush event, etc.  Hazing varies from chapter to chapter, so I can't give you a definite answer on that one. Normally things you're required to do are menial/don't rise to the level of ""serious"" hazing, so you'll be fine.  Definitely rush though, as you have nothing to lose."

They'll ask stuff like why do you want to join, what made you choose this house, stuff like that. Then they'll try and fuck with you. I remember one of the questions I was asked during mine was ""Describe to me in detail how you would make a ham sandwich"". Usually there will be 5-6 brothers in the interview and it will be 3 or so questions per brother and 15 minutes max. Try and have fun with but answer the serious questions seriously.  Hazing is usually mental because they don't want to get kicked off campus. Expect to be required to learn a bunch of menial information about brothers you won't remember and you'll get yelled at a bunch. The closest thing that we have come to hazing so far has been a scavenger hunt for stupid things like sex toys and porn. Really not a big deal."

Frat,2zehcy,RallyMech,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"Rushing was fairly easy at my university. You would walk into the student union area where everyone hung out and you would see all the rush banners. From there, you could either contact the rush chairman, or just go up to the house, it didn't really matter. Each house would have a list of events they were having that week. It was hard to attend most of them, so I attended the 3 houses I was most interested in based off of previous parties and similar events.  Interviews- They pretty much just get some background information about you like where are you from, what's your major, why did you choose this house, what can you bring to the fraternity, etc. They asked me a lot of funny questions like what animal would I fuck and made me play FMK with a sorority. It was a lot of fun honestly and really chill.  Pledging/Hazing- It is really gonna matter on what the situation and history of greek life is at your university. If the greek life at your university has been getting in trouble a lot like mine has, it will(Most Likely) be easier. If the chapter is fairly new, then you can assume you won't get hazed. The main ones that haze are the ones that have been around for a long time(at least at my university). As for hazing, my pledge class educator made it simple for us: Don't fuck up, and you won't get fucked up. Needless to say, we fucked up A LOT. Your experience will be different however. Like I said earlier, it all depends on the current greek life situation at your university."

Some greek orgs do pledge while others do paper processes or automatic bids. Some campuses have much stricter guidelines for fraternities to follow as well as keeping a closer eye on greek orgs, this may lead to an easier pledging process since the fraternity doesn't want to be caught hazing. Some campuses say they have strict guidelines and rules to follow for greek orgs but don't really follow through with them, this leads to some frats knowing they can get away with having a more challenging pledge process."

I researched the motto and history of the fraternity and loved that, too. The only problem was the pledge process. I forgot to include that I have pictures of the notebook that we all must have and the texts involving the duration of the nights, asking if ""we're good,"" and other things.

Growing up in the richer, predominately white suburbs of my city, I know the kids growing up in the north east side were not getting the same education as me.  Their schools were worse, and their neighborhoods were worse.  Does that make me a better human being for being born in a better part of the city, to white parents? No, I was just given a better opportunity than they were.  And I know it's pretty close to being the same around the country. Does that mean that I believe in hand outs? No, I completely believe in hard work and dedication, but I don't think that it is 100% unfair for the University of Oklahoma to accept black students with lower test scores than white students percentage wise (because I'm sure there are a shit ton more white students than black students within the program number wise).  What I ultimately hope for, is that people will be able to be judged by their intelligence and their character, rather than their skin color.

Now when all the students get into the class, do you think that the students with the lower test scores will have a harder time? Of course they will, they are not near as prepared.

But I know, that at least in the Portland area, kids born in the Northeast part of the city had to work a hell of a lot harder than me to get the same test scores.  That is why I am ok with this TEMPORARY discrimination.  But that is all it should be.  Temporary.

People just don't get it. I don't understand how I can be held responsible for the actions of people in a group I have no control over. I know that at my chapter we don't accept any sort of racist mentality (being mixed race, I wouldn't have fucking joined if they did) and that's all I can do. I understand that there are some internal issues in the Greek system but if my chapter and I actively are trying to push that out of the community, that's ALL we can fucking do. Past that point trying to hold us responsible by association is like blaming Marshawn Lynch for Ray Rice hitting his wife because they're both running backs.  Besides, racism isn't a fucking Greek problem. It's an American cultural problem, and people are trying to shove it onto us because they want to distance themselves from it. ""Well, I must not be complicit in any racism, because I'm not in a frat, and racism is for frat boys.""  And on a separate note, what fucked me up the most about the Reddit hivemind's reaction to the OU SAE incident is that the default subs upvote, gild, and support thinly veiled or even blatantly racist shit on a daily basis. These people don't give a fuck about racism, they're just co-opting it as an excuse to beat down fraternities because reddit is heavily populated by socially inept people with a high school ""I hate the cool kids because I'm not cool"" mentality.   Putting aside being mad about being given shit for stuff I didn't do, I'm incredibly disillusioned by this. Nobody will EVER be able to have an honest conversation about the nature of racial issues in this country until the agendas, ulterior motives, finger pointing, irrationality, intellectual dishonesty, and refusal to face any solutions that aren't morally or otherwise simplistic enough all get thrown out the window.

The modern era of fraternity life  began in the late 1940s when soldiers, sailors, and marines returned from WWII with their GI Bill in hand and flooded college campuses and fraternity houses for the education they had abandoned to serve our country and to free the world.  Because these guys were all older (22-25 mostly) than the average freshman, and because most of these guys had already worked out their adolescent mischief in the military (or had it beaten out of them), there may have been fewer fraternity related deaths, rapes, and scandals (data actually show there were very few fraternity hazing deaths until the 1960s).  A new wave of vets are landing on college campuses to continue their education.  These men, already burnished by a crucible far beyond pledgeship, should be plum targets for Rush Chairmen.  They can add a settled wisdom to a chapter, and can sometimes tamp down on excesses that would take the chapter ""A Bridge Too Far."""

But if you don't know right from wrong, then ""don't have loud opinions about race, sexuality or religion"" is probably a good rule of thumb. I can't imagine just hanging out while some juvenile dickhead is making baby-racist jokes. Like sticking around the buffet after someone shit in the punchbowl. It's disgusting.

Talk to his high school friends and to the kids he grew up with.  Talk to his ex girlfriend.  Pull his social media accounts and go through them.   Bid only guys better than the guys you have.  Even if that means falling short on numbers and having to throw a fundraiser or two - in addition to philanthropy - fundraisers to fund your own operations.  Hold on to prolonged pledgeships - a prolonged pledgeship is how the actives deeply inculcate the values, behaviors, and expectations of the fraternity into the pledges.  Choose your best guys as pledgemasters - not your sadistic loose canons.  A good pledgeship under a worthy pledgemaster might have prevented this SAE nonsense.

The Greek system as a whole at OU is extremely inclusive and does not share these views.  I am appalled to be a part of a system that contained an organization of such views.  Our greek system will be set back for years by this and prospective students will not forget about this for sometime.  But concerning these calls for the Greek system to disappear, those are the media generally doing their thing by blowing things out of proportion.  The SAE house had always been a major problem at the university.  They have been close to getting removed from the university multiple times since i have been here and truly represent every negative quantification of Greek life. They did not represent our culture well and we suffered for it.  They really never did any good for the university as long as i have been here.  I would say that there really isn't any quick solution to the problem.  This SAE chapter didn't turn to hell overnight, the beliefs of past members were probably allowed to stay around when they should have been quashed out.  Not to say that the chapter has not always been this way.  I would advise anyone at another campus to not let these or any similar beliefs stay in your chapters but to allow your fellow brothers to know that these thoughts should not be shared and should not stay within the house.   Make sure that your chapters are prepared to make the right decisions when after you have gone.  This issue will not get solved overnight it will take years and large effort."

If someone shows up to your party in blackface, throw them out or scrub their face and then send them home.   Kappa sigma has four pillars. Scholarship leadership fellowship and service. Focus on your stated core values. In my case, I would look to fellowship and service. Volunteer at the local VFW and call the local newspaper to write a story about how your giving back to the community. Maybe find an old disabled alumni who needs some help around his one house. Mow his lawn or something. Get the press there to write a story about that.

SAE did away with pledging after all the horrible stuff that occurred because in their head it was the pledging that was bad, not the brothers.  I agree completely though. SAE chapters have to start looking past their ""traditions"".  My chapter is relatively new(only about 5 years old) so maybe I'm still in that honeymoon stage but I've seen what a force for good SAE can be. We've been adamant bout acting more like a service organization rather than a social one and its worked great.

Then it was fraternities as symbols of the 1%.   With the US Justice Dept Title IX suit against big colleges, they were shifting to a claim that fraternities are rape dungeons as part of the War on Women (until UVa proved to be bad fiction).  Now they are adding the racist piece.

Which is a double edged sword of a doozy."
Frat,2yx72c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,7,Sat Mar 14 12:41:03 2015 UTC,"The charge of ""creating a hostile learning environment"" is meaningless, because the WAY they supposedly created a hostile learning environment was solely and entirely through their protected speech.  It's also pretty hard to argue that chanting idiots, rolling down the highway on a private chartered bus, off campus (waayy off campus) created a hostile learning environment back on campus.  The football team canceled practice, but I don't think the football team is an approved course, even at OU.  As far as I have read, classes were never canceled, students never walked out, professors were never pelted with rotten eggs during lecture as a result. The protesters slashed tires and tagged the house, but I don't think that was part of assigned classwork.   This looks like the kids were expelled solely for what they chanted and nothing more."
Frat,2yx72c,Salty_Minnesota,3,Sat Mar 14 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"Right right. A recruit did decommit, so they also cited or could cite that it effects the recruitment of their school.

You don't have to like it, and I for one don't like what they did, but they're allowed to do it, and I respect that.  OU also violated the fifth amendment by not giving them due process, or a formal hearing of expelling them. They can expel them for violating a school code of conduct, sure, but they have to follow the proper steps that they've set in order to sure that their expulsion is fair. This doesn't meant that they wouldn't have been expelled, but that they should have been given a fair trial or hearing through the proper channels of the school."

However, at least in my experience, I had to sign a document saying that I had read through the student conduct handbook and understood that any violations of that conduct code could result in discipline from the school all the way up to expulsion. If that was/is the case then any violation that occurred because of the racist comments allows OU to take whatever action necessary. If the students who were expelled signed on any line agreeing to these types of stipulations then their would seem to be no likely recourse."

Would that be defrauding you (and every student for decades) of the right to free speech that you might have exercised but did not, believing you had signed that right away?  What if, even if you signed, the speech restrictions are and always have been unenforceable, because the US Constitution trumps anything a college administrator cooks up to make his campus less noisy?

The point of the lawsuit would be to stop State Universities from punishing speech, just because the the university finds the content of the speech disagreeable, hateful, or offensive.  The lawsuit will not bring these men back into SAE, but the lawsuit may help protect other fraternity men on other campuses - because college administrations now seem to be inordinately focused on scapegoating fraternities.  The lawsuit would also protect the college educations of the SAE brothers - the two who were expelled and the other brothers who the OU President seems to be considering for discipline.   This may be an expensive suit to bring; if OU fights, it could wind up in the US Supreme Court.  The damages won from the suit may be huge - civil rights actions carry treble damages plus attorneys fees.  That would be good.  It seems that very basic, plainly written Rights (like the 1st and 2nd Amendments), are now requiring recertification by our highest court to stop perhaps well intentioned nanny-state Napoleons from whittling them away.   College students are not children who need protection from offensive speech, opinions, or ideas.  In fact, that's part of what college is supposed to do - expose you to the wide range of ideas and teach you to sort for yourself the wheat from the chaff.

Freedom of speech is essentially ""The right to freedom of speech allows individuals to express themselves without interference or constraint by the government"". Public schools are deemed part of the government, which is where the case lies - can OU kick the students out for what they said? Private institutions are not part of the government, and they can set their own code of conduct. This is why SAE is allowed to de-charter the OU chapter for their hate speech."

The Chapter House was owned by OU (such a bad idea), and OU's President kicked them out of the house, making the entire chapter homeless with 48 hours to move out and find somewhere else to live. SAE's Nationals President supported OU's decision to kick them out of the house and SAE's Nationals President also supported OU's decision to expel the members.  Actually, I think Brad Cohen tweeted that he hoped they were all expelled."

JP Morgan, which held a $500K account of SAE's, decided not to do business with SAE as a twisted way of complying with new Federal rules requiring banks to vet their customers.  And supposedly, SAE's insurer threatened to cancel their policies.  But there were other ways to deal with the insurance issue, and ending Pledgeship was thought by cooler heads to be unnecessarily damaging to the fraternity culture.  T Boon Pickens, an SAE alum, argued to SAE Nationals that they institute more focused alcohol and drug programs instead - he was ignored.  Interestingly, SAE's membership was never consulted about ending Pledgeship - that was done solely by Mr. Cohen and his Council at Nationals.  This summer, SAE members will get to speak and act on Mr. Cohen's leadership and policies, and they will have a chance to reverse his end to Pledgeship."
Frat,2yx72c,TDenverFan,5,Fri Mar 13 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"Just like any other fraternity, SAE nationals has to go into ultra CYA mode every time a chapter steps out of line in any way. Unfortunately, that usually means leaving the brothers out to dry. Don't get me wrong, OU SAE deserved what they got, but I think it's a sad reality that as an active member you can't expect the national fraternity to go to bat for you."
Frat,2yx72c,seanjohn12117,4,Sat Mar 14 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"Right. I mean Brad removed their charter, cool. Then he tweeted about his support for OU expelling them.

If the alumni-led up-line Nationals structure of fraternities is not in place to protect and preserve the Chapter House, each of its Active Brothers and Pledges, and their collective valuable traditions; then what, exactly is its purpose?    Frankly, I'd like to see SAE Nationals support the lawsuit and I actually think it might be good for SAE and for SAE's image.  SAE could say, ""Wait a minute OU, these ex-SAEs committed an offense against SAE and against their vows to SAE, during an SAE event, OFF campus.  Punishing their offensive behavior is our responsibility, and we have done so severely.   OU has no right to further punish them for their offensive speech, off your campus."""
Frat,2yx72c,TheBROinBROHIO,3,Sat Mar 14 04:39:53 2015 UTC,"I've shaken the man's hand when I went to our leadership school. I do not dislike him. Ending pledgeship was a shitty thing to do, and they way they forced it through was shittier still, but I understand it. Lloyds of London, the last insurance company in the world that would actually insure us, was going to drop us if we didn't end pledging."
Frat,2yx72c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,7,Fri Mar 13 16:49:36 2015 UTC,"There were (and are) other ways of dealing with the insurance problem - truly.  Your nationals gutted the foundation of the Pledge bond in order to insure their financial security.  And they did so without a vote of the brotherhood.  To my eye, that's betrayal.  And it left SAE as a club.  Remember, one of these two ex-SAE brothers was a freshman - the other a sophomore - one or both were initiated 96 hours after bidding with NO pledgeship under Brad Cohen's edict.  Pledgeship was the crucible fraternities used to deeply inculcate proper behavior and values so that new initiates reflected well on the fraternity.  While there is no question that the two idiots are primarily responsible for their own behavior, I think Mr. Cohen and his singlehanded abolition of Pledgeship has some accountability here too.  This summer, you and your brothers will have an opportunity to endorse or reject those policies - and to return pledgeship to SAE.  But that decision is yours and your brothers to make - as it should be."
Frat,2yx72c,TheBROinBROHIO,2,Fri Mar 13 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"Even if the two SAEs in the video were initiated within 96 hours of their receiving a bid, they still had to learn that chant, didn't they? Someone, presumably someone who wasn't initiated under SAE's new program, probably taught it to them. Plus, the brothers who were singing along and trying to stop the girls recording it are to blame too. This isn't a case of two people doing something stupid. It's the public demonstration of something that had obviously been going on for some time."
Frat,2yx72c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Fri Mar 13 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone knowledgable has said how many of the ex-SAEs on the bus were initiated in the last three semesters, since the loss of SAE's Pledgeship.  I understand it was a large house, so the number is likely larger than just these two.  I understand your point, and one of the two has said they were taught the song.  So it's likely this was known in the chapter before this bus trip.  That's one reason I supported SAE Nationals closing the chapter.  But I still think the Pledgeship loss is important.  Chapters do not appoint their loose canons to be Pledge Masters.   You appoint Pledge Masters who reflect and will inculcate the values the chapter wants to pass on.  Even if there were vocal racists among the actives, a crucible Pledgeship could have inculcated deeply into the Pledge Class that racism was abhorrent to the fraternity and was wholey unacceptable in their class."
Frat,2yx72c,TheBROinBROHIO,0,Fri Mar 13 17:18:19 2015 UTC,I can tell you that many old SAE chapters know that song.
Frat,2yx72c,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Fri Mar 13 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell this is only a sentiment due to them losing pledgeship, and just the general dislike of nationals. Seems like everyone has supported him in this scenario."
Frat,2yx72c,TheBROinBROHIO,5,Fri Mar 13 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.  SAE is a private organization, and it can and does set high standards for its members - those high standards are part of a fraternity's purpose.  And as a private organization, SAE has the right (and maybe the duty) to weed out members and chapters that irreparably fail to work toward those standards.  If SAE Nationals (Mr. Cohen) had moved feebly in addressing this, the media storm would have caused much more damage to many more chapters, perhaps even taking down SAE Nationals and all the chapters with it (if insurers had concluded SAE was uninsurable), endangering the genuinely positive experience most fraternity men have from their chapter."

Frat,2yx72c,Damngladtomeetyou,3,Fri Mar 13 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"The article was very unclear but it seemed to imply that the University was not within its rights to suspend the fraternity, which is not only questionable in and of itself but kind of a pointless battle because the national org already suspended them. Meaning racism and freedom of speech aside, the University was under no obligation to recognize SAE and permit their housing."
Frat,2yx72c,WEEEIRD,2,Fri Mar 13 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"But once recognized, the University (as a State University) was NOT within its rights to act against the fraternity or its members in order to punish the content of their speech.  Government can't do that."
Frat,2yx72c,roundtree,5,Sun Mar 15 15:56:27 2015 UTC,So a university has to permit a group of guys pretending to be in a fraternity to live in campus-owned designated Greek housing and use the same resources available to official fraternities? Never heard of that rule.
Frat,2yx72c,WEEEIRD,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"A good point.  Once SAE pulled the charter, OU had no duty to continue to recognize the fraternity - because OU could have been acting purely on the fact that the charter had been pulled independent of the speech content that caused the charter to have been pulled.  Maybe OU has a clause in the lease of the OU owned house that if the National HQ pulls the fraternity charter, then the lease is automatically voided.  That's valid.  But a State University cannot act to punish students for the content of their speech, particularly off campus speech."
Frat,2yx72c,Damngladtomeetyou,2,Fri Mar 13 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"I think if anything is debateable, it's the expulsion of the individual students. I'm certainly not in the tank for them but I don't know enough about relevant court cases/ other legal precedent to say. But I think those arguing for the chapter not to be shut down are going down the wrong path. There's a pesky stereotype out there that frat guys will defend each other's shitty actions to the death rather than hold them accountable and those people aren't helping."

They never even implied that they would agree with you if you did it. They simply said that ""you can hang them from a tree but they'll never sign with me."" This could even be construed as them saying that they would not accept black members just to show sympathy for racism. Just because they have been hung from trees doesn't mean they can become an SAE.   Look I don't agree with it, but this doesn't constitute hate speech or violate anyone's rights. See Terminiello v Chicago 1949. A Supreme Court ruled that to constitute illegal hate speech, there must be shown to likely produce a clear and present danger of substantiative evil that rises far above public inconvenience or annoyance or unrest"

Frat,2yzfyl,Flexin_Texan,19,Mon Mar 16 06:25:50 2015 UTC,"Fraternities would be more likely to hold on to their traditional fraternity culture (pledging, partying, privacy, philanthropy, adventuring, leadership, high standards) if their chapter houses were moved off campus, so that college administrations had less responsibility for the affairs inside the house.  Privacy, in an age when everyone has a video recorder, is the challenge of the next decade."
Frat,2yzfyl,RobinIsAGoodfellow,10,Sat Mar 14 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"Our house is off campus and our university is so far up our ass it's insane. They recently tried to audit our books. They were going to ""randomly"" audit greek groups on campus. I told our president don't give them a goddamn thing this is another scare tactic.  Sure enough beacuse the university dosent give us any money the audit would have been illegal. They said they are going to rework the rule and come back for a audit again. I know each university is different but dont expect being off campus will make a university less likely to try to fuck you. This has been a ongoing problem for us all year."
Frat,2yzfyl,orangechicken21,7,Sat Mar 14 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"Good on you for standing up for your privacy.  If you are off campus, much of what your campus dean can and cannot do depends on whether you are at a State University or a Private University. If you are at a Private University, much of what a college can do is spelled out in whatever agreements your chapter and your nationals signed with the college.   Find an alum who's a good attorney and run each and every situation by him as they occur - let him guide you.  Sometimes it's better to run things by a local alum attorney, rather than Nationals.  Nationals, sadly, has their own agendas that all too often do not involve protecting individual chapters and individual brothers."
Frat,2yzfyl,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Sat Mar 14 20:45:45 2015 UTC,We are at a state school but i think it would be a good idea keep in touch with a lawyer. I am not studying law but the second I heard the word audit I knew their was no fucking way they could do that.
Frat,2yzfyl,orangechicken21,6,Sat Mar 14 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"Good.  Being at a State University significantly constrains what your University can do.  It helps you retain the privacy of your chapter house and the privacy of your affairs.  Just because the University says you have to do something, or even if you or your chapter signed an agreement agreeing to something, always run requests or demands past an attorney who is one of your alums.  If you're a new chapter and don't have any attorney alums, ask other nearby chapters for their lawyer.  It IS reasonable for a University that gives an organization student fee funds to regularly or randomly audit the use of those funds - but if you get no money, there is no reason for them to want to audit money they never gave you.  Hint: NEVER take money from your college."
Frat,2yzfyl,RobinIsAGoodfellow,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"Thats what I said the only way they can audit us is to make sure that their money is being used appropriately, and as far as I know we dont get jack shit. It was some slimy shit they were trying to pull."

Frat,2yzfyl,orangechicken21,4,Mon Mar 16 20:55:53 2015 UTC,Greek life at my university has been completely off campus and un associated from the University since they led a giant attack against Greek life and our football program in the 80s. 4 fraternities and 3 sororities died out but since the early 2000s we're growing again. 6 fraternities and 5 sororities. It's a way different feeling though because we don't have traditional houses we are comprised entirely of multiple live outs spread out along 2 streets in a neighborhood where only students live. So we now only deal with the police for parties which sucks because of fines but that's really it.
Frat,2yzfyl,Captain_Gypsy,6,Sun Mar 15 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"Find a developer - maybe who's an alum - to assemble the parcels and build some larger fraternity houses - set back from the street and away from non-student neighbors - as close to campus as possible to making walking to class easy.  That might give you a proper House, and shield your indoor parties from undue police interruptions.  A growing fraternity could be a profitable development deal for a skilled and experienced developer."
Frat,2yzfyl,RobinIsAGoodfellow,5,Sun Mar 15 03:40:48 2015 UTC,There are really only two chapters with alum stretching more than 10 years. My chapter which I'm a founding father of just started here 2 years ago. Also we are on the west coast in the Bay Area so there isn't really land to develop and if their were homes/land they would be way over priced. Basically the whole situation isn't ideal to a very traditional Greek system but it is still a huge part of the student body here.
Frat,2yzfyl,Captain_Gypsy,5,Sun Mar 15 03:46:16 2015 UTC,"The fraternities that are dying out are the openly doing the shit we all hide.

Frat,2yzfyl,CarltonFrater,2,Sat Mar 14 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will completely die out anytime soon, but I do see them becoming something way less exclusive and with less housing options. It seems that no chapters are really stepping up to replace the ""good"" chapters that are kicked off campus ( by good I mean ones with a long history and one known for producing steroetypical fraternity men). I wouldn't be surprised to see some smaller national organizations to close as well. With the recent bad press all greeks have gotten, it will be harder to sell kids on greek life who are on the fence about it."
Frat,2yzfyl,Dizzy2294,2,Sat Mar 14 05:40:02 2015 UTC,its a lot easier to sell the kids on greek life than parents. Parents who weren't in greek life will refuse to help their kids with dues and freak out about it.   most kids who aren't even interested in greek life come to love it once they start meeting the people in it

Frat,2yurrs,TDenverFan,3,Fri Mar 13 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"We had two members who didn't come out until after school (one still isn't technically out). One wasn't ready to make the call and the other for family related reasons.  I caught the one guy sneaking guys out in the middle of the night on a few occasions. We always kind of assumed, so I went with whatever unneeded excuse he lobbed at me each time.   Most of the negative sentiment towards the situations were that most were upset that these guys felt they couldn't confide in the other brothers that they were gay. I understand that they probably had their reasons, hopefully they didn't think we wouldn't accept them, but it felt a little hurtful as a brother."
Frat,2yurrs,Apocalvps,7,Fri Mar 13 22:35:03 2015 UTC,Yeah one got kicked out (not because he was gay he ended up having a lot of character problems) and the other was closeted until his last day of presidency when he came out and we accepted that. It was a nice moment. I wont lie it has been weird at times knowing that but in all they were completely accepted and treated same as any brother.

Maybe it's because I'm in the south east but I couldn't imagine a fraternity having a gay person.

Another didn't feel comfortable talking about his boyfriend very much. It really depended on the individual.

Fraternities don't have houses at my school for the most part, but it's pretty common for there to be gays in Greek Life here.

It sounds like this was a long time coming and I'd hope someone in the media will recognize that this began with nationals suspending the chapter long before this incident.  What disturbs me is how the college is already talking about expelling members depending upon their 'investigation' into racist comments... apparently making a racist remark behind closed doors is now an offense worthy of expulsion.
Frat,2yu9o2,TheBROinBROHIO,0,Fri Mar 13 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"apparently making a racist remark behind closed doors is now an offense worthy of expulsion.   Now a days, yeah. Even with the Donald Sterling thing. If you're not familiar he was a basketball owner and he said in a private conversation that he didn't want blacks at his game. And of course media had a field day with it."
Frat,2yu9o2,newark02,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"At least in his case it was a relatively public figure with clear financial means, who clearly understood the consequences of being a racist prick.  I can understand why a black person wouldn't want to go to their games or play for their team when the owner held those views.  Compare this with a group of college students making an admittedly racist remark among friends.  That might make me want to not be friends with them and I definitely wouldn't want them in my chapter, but there's a big difference between that and demanding they be expelled.  When Mixon's incident went down at OU, there was all kinds of language about ""he made a mistake"" in a moment of ""poor judgment"", and there was all kinds of redemption messages about how he'll be allowed to earn his way back.  Compare this with greek life these days.  One ""mistake"", one inappropriate remark, and none of that is to be found.  There's no talk of ""these are college kids who probably grew up in racist communities, and maybe they were just being stupid to try and impress their racist friends"".  They charge straight to ""kick them out of college!"""

Frat,2yowoi,headyasphuck,27,Wed Mar 11 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"Constitutionality doesn't matter. Rule of law doesn't matter. All that matters is that the bloodlust is quenched and the mob frenzy is given an outlet. Nonconformists must be punished swiftly and harshly.   Justice, especially in the court of public consumption, is shifting rapidly from a platonic ideal to whatever outcome is deemed favorable by ""progressive"" forces."
Frat,2yowoi,relee1865,5,Wed Mar 11 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be constitutional if they claimed the speech was 'inciting violence' or violated the student conduct code. That may not be true, but from a cost effectiveness standpoint it might make more sense for the university to expel these guys now and pay a settlement later than to look like they just let the behavior go unpunished and face backlash for that.   It's not like Waka and the football recruit guy care about constitutionality, and sometimes the interests of wealthy donors get outweighed by the masses. Financial leverage works both ways."
Frat,2yowoi,TheBROinBROHIO,9,Wed Mar 11 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"The student conduct code does not supersede the Constitution.  Though, it is deplorable what they did, I do not think expulsion solely on words is allowable."

Thus it's in their best interest to drag it out and accept their loss once the media frenzy has died down. Not saying they're 'right' to do it, just saying that's probably why they did it."
Frat,2yowoi,TheBROinBROHIO,3,Wed Mar 11 18:43:31 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying... they would rather pay an out of court settlement than have their institution's reputation sullied. They know it's unconstitutional.

Frat,2yowoi,relee1865,7,Wed Mar 11 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Ironically, the type of lawsuit that would be brought on behalf of the expelled students would be a civil rights action - which carries the threat of treble damages and all attorneys' fees.  Considering OU made the entire Chapter homeless and (presumably) voided the lease on the OU owned house, treble damages could be a really substantial number."
Frat,2yowoi,RobinIsAGoodfellow,2,Wed Mar 11 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"You're saying a lot of things I disagree strongly with, but let me focus on this:   look like they just let the behavior go unpunished and face backlash for that.   The ""behavior"" at hand is spoken word, and universities should never feel pressured to punish speech."
Frat,2yowoi,relee1865,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the question of what ""should"" be done gets muddled when money is involved. Happens all the time.

No, just when someone with money has an opinion and public officials value their careers over ethics, although ""when the going gets tough"" has certainly been their go-to excuse.

Frat,2yowoi,nmhunate,8,Wed Mar 11 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, and I could be wrong, is that the person saying the hate speech has to be willing and able to perform the act or actively trying to incite a riot or violence for it to not be covered under the 1st Amendment. I can say that I want to use my F22 to blow up the white house, but a reasonable person can assume that I am not going to perform the act. If SAE actually had a recent history of lynching black people, then yeah, it could be regarded as a threat not covered. Interestingly, Mike Brown's step father used a megaphone to try to incite a large group of people to ""burn this motherfucker (Ferguson) down"" which falls under ""inciting a riot"" but was not charged. It seems like the reality is that the media leads to picking and choosing when a threat or non-threat will be prosecuted."

I've met people from chapters from big schools, small schools, large state schools, city schools, and rural schools, and it surprises me how much they all vary. I can honestly tell you that a some of the most interesting and unique people I know were met through Greek life.   Yes, there are chapters and even a couple of entire fraternities where there are pervasive cultural issues that need to be dealt with and I will be the first one to admit it. But I still don't understand how people think they can accurately paint thousands they've never met with the same brush.  You're adhering to a tv and movie based stereotype of Greek life that doesn't actually exist at many schools or chapters, although it does it some places.  IMO the fierce determination that some people have to hate ALL fraternity members (characterized by strawmen arguments, reasoning completely founded upon false assumptions, and denial of any evidence that doesn't fit preconceived negative biases) seems to be based around a high school-ish ""I hate the cool kids"" mentality."

Frat,2yres6,_Katipo,6,Thu Mar 12 04:18:11 2015 UTC,"How do I convince the FSL Director and subsequently the IFC, to think about my case for expansion as different, so they approve it at the earliest time period?   Your case for expansion isn't different though. You want to start a new fraternity. So do three other groups. How is that unique?   My case is already somewhat unique in the fact that a student (me) has advocated for the expansion of a specific fraternity (usually the universtity picks and chooses the Greek organizations to add).   This counts against you, not for you. The University normally has a process to decide which organizations to allow onto campus, and now you're asking them to allow you to exercise that authority. And do you think the three new colonies on campus don't have students lobbying on their own behalf?   It is also unique because I have an interest group, and that I have contacted Nationals and they are eager to expand to my university.   So do the three new groups. They aren't made up of university administrators, they're made up of students who made an interest group/colony. Obviously if they're getting to the point where they're actually recognized by FSL and IFC, they're recognized by a national organization.  In short: you're not a special snowflake, and I can understand IFC's hesitancy at allowing you to start expansion with three other groups doing the same thing."
Frat,2yres6,Impune,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"My post assumes that you have a presentation at a regular IFC meeting and not a written proposal.  First off, you're going to need some friends on your side. If you don't already have friends in fraternity leadership, see if you can set up some meetings. Talk to them about how you plan to expand Greek life rather than cannibalize it, and expect to back it up somehow.  Second, you should ask that FSL director for some data on Greek life at your scfhool. You need to convince people that there's room for Greek Life to grow, and if you don't know the basic info like Greek-Independent ratio you will look like you're talking out of your ass. Don't make it part of your proposal necessarily, just memorize a few facts in case you need them for Q&A.  Third, control the talking points. You want to avoid someone bringing up the other 3 new fraternities if possible, which is why you talk to as many IFC officers and house delegates as possible before the meeting. If someone does bring it up, you need a good answer prepared.  Fourth, bring a well-spoken local alumnus. You probably have an alum living in the area from an already established chapter, and National can help you get in touch with him. He only needs to talk for a few minutes about how much it would mean to him and the other local alumni members if there was a local chapter. If you get this, I feel like delegates will feel almost obligated to say yes.  Good luck"

Because you don't."
Frat,2yqpdt,CigBreak,10,Thu Mar 12 01:22:45 2015 UTC,"There was a guy in my pledge class who had just got out of the army. I thought it was a bit strange when I first found out but as I got to know him he became one of my really good friends. We were a pretty small house at the time, but we're growing fast. He was never really into going to functions with Soroities or competing hard for philanthropies like most of the freshmen are, but you could bet he would always be at brotherhood events or just hanging out with the guys. I don't know if you could say he was a great member because he never wanted to do the bullshit that most freshmen and sophomores go through (never lived in, missed chapter semi regularly, etc) but he was a damn great brother and someone that everybody looked up to and could depend on. My advice would be to join a house, but maybe look to one of the smaller houses on campus where you can make a real connection instead of having to deal with all the bullshit."

Most all sorority girls will be at least 3 years younger than you.

While I didnt have the same life experience as you, I too joined older than most of my pledge class. I did have a different perspective on things when I rushed.   I say go for you.

Let's be real, there are chapters out there that do contain these flaws and it does us no good to ignore them. More chapters need to take an active stance in discussion and education on these topics. Fraternities and sororities have a huge opportunity to be a powerful vehicle for positive social change in many young adults at college, and many chapters are instituting great educational opportunities to allow their members to grow, but we need to continue and heighten this effort. I know my chapter has started plans on how we can actively combat things on campus, and yours should too. I hopefully will see actions being taken across campuses in the US and by Greeks soon.   Greeks do a lot of great things as it is now, but it's time we continue to add more to this repertoire and remove negative aspects of our community."

Its national news for a few reasons (and football players beating someone up isn't for some other reasons):   We, as a society, abhor racism and embrace violence (to an extent). The frat was from the south, proud of its southern roots, and proud of fighting for the confederacy, all of these things, mixed with a chant about racism looks really fucking bad. Have you ever tried to teach a group of people a chant? with the exception of drunk soccer fans, people suck at learning chants quickly, which means this was clearly taught to them, add that with reason two and suddenly you have a pattern of racism, couple that with the fact that there obviously are no current minorities in the frat, leads to a lot of suspicion. Like you said assaults happen every day... its why they aren't news, its not every day a group of people chant racist things on a bus and its caught on camera. This probably plays into some sort of media narrative, whether rightly or wrongly.  I may be anti frat, but that doesn't mean I don't recognize that the media wants stories like this, as much as they want stories of police brutality, this shit sells.  Now I happen to think that racism, police brutality are both subjects the american people need to hear about, but again, its a narrative. If you're in the south, and some other places, you'll realize football players get a lot of other protections that normal students don't.

How about we let a jury (that might consist of minorities) decide that case. /s.  In a sense of acceptance, every school has certain criteria that has to be followed in order to stay enrolled. The guys just got caught on camera violating the rules. Someone could argue that the every person on the bus should be expelled, but there's not enough definite proof for each individual outside of the two ring leaders.   Now, if they expelled the entire frat from the school, that is where the lines get blurred and legal action might be considered. But that's not what happened, so we don't have to worry about that."

Frat,2ylc4o,reddhead4,6,Tue Mar 10 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Well in your any of your pre-law classes you may have learned about authority.  At a public university, what the Constitution and Supreme Court say matter more than the student handbook.  They are being expelled for their speech, and they will win a lawsuit if they're stupid enough to file one, but they'll probably choose to slip off into obscurity and have their expulsions erased if they're smart."

By your logic, if someone got caught cheating and was expelled, then they could sue the university and win because the Constitution and Supreme court say that person didn't break any laws?  Sorry, but that's not how it works. A university has accepted guidelines to follow and if you disobey those guidelines, you get removed from the university. The Constitution does not protect one's privilege in being a part of the university.  In any of your Pre-law classes, you would realize that this has nothing to do with the bill of rights and the justice system."
Frat,2ylc4o,doglinsonbrooks,14,Tue Mar 10 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"Public universities are bound by the First Amendment. Thus, both public university students and public university teachers are entitled to some protection from discipline, firing, and other retaliation for their speech. In some areas, this protection is pretty clear and pretty broad. In others, it's relatively vague. Student speech outside the classroom and outside academic assignments. Most clearly, students generally may not be expelled, suspended, or otherwise disciplined for what they say in student newspapers, at demonstrations, in out-of-class conversations, and the like. The Supreme Court made this clear in Papish v. Board of Curators, 410 U.S. 667 (1973), and Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169 (1972). Lower courts have followed suit, especially in the late 1980s and 1990s cases that have struck down student speech codes. See, e.g., Dambrot v. Central Michigan Univ., 55 F.3d 1177 (6th Cir. 1995); Iota Xi v. George Mason Univ., 993 F.2d 386 (4th Cir. 1993); UWM Post v. Univ. of Wisc., 74 F. Supp. 1163 (E.D. Wis. 1991); Doe v.

If the rules they agreed to by becoming a student included a statement as to the potential punisent for this particular violation then they are completely in the wrong.  In that case I believe what the university did was well within their rights, personally however, I find expulsion to be a disgusting attempt at ""making an example"" of these guys. They're idiots and need to think about their lived a bit, but I think expulsion was well over the line.  Comment and tell me what's wrong with any of this rather than downvoting.

Frat,2ylc4o,pwnproof,5,Wed Mar 11 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Expulsion solves a problem for both the student and the school.    It removes the student from what would almost certainly be an untenable hostile environment in which he would likely be assaulted or harassed on a continuing basis.  He would be an outcast at BEST.  The student would likely be unwilling to leave at first, for lots of reasons, but that would really not be in the student's best interest, and it's best that he's forced out now before creating a long and deteriorating situation in which he eventually leaves anyway.  And for the school, the benefits are obvious.  They save face, deal with a problem on campus by nipping it in the bud, and make moves toward moving past this event without the distraction of the student still on campus."

Removing the fraternity should have been more than enough. That is not a minor punishment by any means. Many of these guys lost their homes.

That's a far better option for the school than letting this drag on for weeks of disciplinary hearings or, worse, doing nothing beyond banishing the fraternity.  As for tension between the Greeks and the rest of the student body, I'd imagine the Greeks lying EXTREMELY low and not making much of a fuss even if they disagree with the harshness of the punishment.  This will all be forgotten by everyone else in a few weeks or months.  As for how Greeks are portrayed, I can't imagine this will change much.  If you're in a fraternity, you likely still think these are a small group of rotten apples that make everyone else look bad.

Frat,2ylc4o,DirtySnakes,0,Wed Mar 11 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"I understand your point and it is valid. I still believe that expulsion was not the answer. Make them take 6 credits of African American studies. Make them give seminars. There are so many punishments that would do more good. Rather than any of that, OU is removing them from the school and creating animosity. Rather than making an example of them by punishing them, they should do it by trying to educate and change perception. Sure it'd probably be wasted effort, but expulsion from a major university is huge and life shattering.   They brought this upon themselves by knowingly breaking the school's rules, (even if that's not the case, ignorance is no excuse when the rules are set in stone) but I do feel their punishment was enough when SAE removed them and revoked their charter/suspended operations/whatever the hell we want to call it. Again, this is just an opinion, and I don't think anyone who disagrees with it is in any way wrong."
Frat,2ylc4o,LaxMcNasty,6,Wed Mar 11 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree. A governmental entity should not punish for speech, no matter what the punishment is. It's not a matter of harshness, but of principle. If Vanderbilt or Harvard or any other private school wished to expel these students, that'd be one thing. But a public state institution has no business seeking retribution for an individual's words."
Frat,2ylc4o,DirtySnakes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"If they have rules in place forbidding this kind of thing and the students agreed to follow those rules, the university does INDEED have every right. Now the rule might be unconstiutional, I'm not a lawyer nor a political scientist, but in that case it is wrong. If the rules is constitutional then there is no reason the university shouldn't be able to enforce it's rules."

Such codes are common in the workplace, in universities,  and in private organizations. The term may be applied to regulations that do not explicitly prohibit particular words or sentences. Speech codes are often applied for the purpose of suppressing hate speech or forms of social discourse thought to be disagreeable to the implementers.

Frat,2yicyp,CigBreak,-2,Wed Mar 11 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Racism in this country is misinterpreted by liberals, who warp it to suit their own agenda. There is a very good reason white people don't like blacks and Mexicans. They like the ones that are responsible and work hard. They don't like the ones that do nothing in school and don't try to work and turn into criminals. It's a huge problem. I mean, school is free, how the fuck do you graduate not knowing how to read? Then they ruin their communities by making them dangerous, violent places, unfriendly towards business.  Before you say any shit about me stereotyping these people wrongly, I WORKED IN THE HOOD FOR YEARS! The news media and entertainment industry are lying their ass off about the hood.

Re-read what I wrote and see if your puny brain can process it and then give a coherent counter argument.

Since a lot of you have expressed that you want to know what I meant, I'll go ahead and explain. Raising money for this man is an admirable thing. It is unfortunate for him that he had to lose his job because of that video that was posted online. However, when the video broke online, I came over here to r/frat in hopes that I would encounter a progressive community of college fraternities guys who would have a fresh perspective on the entire fiasco. The top post on the front page was this post.  I'm sorry to say, Hayward is not a victim. The Oklahoma SAE chapter was probably known to be racist years before he took his position. It was probably known to be racist while he worked there. This video was only confirmatory evidence of the racism I think everyone knew existed. I don't really see this as a genuine effort to get Hayward back up on his feet. Instead, it looks like a deflection of the allegations of institutional racism. ""Here, we're not racist. Of course we're not racist. Look! We're giving money to a black chef! That racism doesn't reflect everyone's attitudes! We'll raise $50,000!"" However, fraternities like the OU chapter of SAE exist at many major universities in the South. It was not an isolated incident. It's an incident that the fraternity is responsible for.   I guess what I'm saying is - I wanted to see yall step up and say, ""What can we do to prevent this from happening in the future? What can we do to prevent fostering this racism?"" Instead, all this does is deny allegations of institutional racism through the act of giving money to an unemployed black chef."

Then start relaying information at those get together as well as email/facebook/etc. Hold chapter in a room in the union, have a formal meeting once a month. Before you can worry about the external you have to focus on the internal because recruitment is every brother's job. And as far as getting better relations from your University... Well it will be tough, make sure you have a faculty advisor for greek council of you already don't. Start making positive press releases as IFC/Panhelinic/Greek Council. Do more philanthropy as a greek community. You need to basically get all of the presidents and representatives of each chapter on campus to sit down and talk with the university and figure out how to solve the problem."

""Fraternity Leadership Closes Chapter at University of Oklahoma  NORMAN, OK – Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently.  We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.  This type of racist behavior will not be tolerated and is not consistent with the values and morals of our fraternity. We have more than 15,000 collegiate members across the nation, and this incident should not reflect on other brothers because this type of hateful action is not what Sigma Alpha Epsilon stands for. This is absolutely not who we are.  We teach our members to serve as role models in their communities and to live up to our creed, “The True Gentleman.” When members fail to do so, we will not hesitate to take corrective actions or to impose sanctions. Any behavior that is not aligned with the conduct we expect is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is bystander behavior of members who fail to intervene when they witness conduct that deviates from our beliefs.  “I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,” said Brad Cohen, the fraternity’s national president. “SAE is a diverse organization, and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior. When we learned about this incident, I called an immediate board meeting, and we determined with no mental reservation whatsoever that this chapter needed to be closed immediately. I am proud of my fellow board members because we mean what we say.”  Although Sigma Alpha Epsilon regrets the closure, we believe members must be held responsible for their actions. We are hopeful that we can re-establish the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at some point in the future with a group of men who exemplify our beliefs and who serve as leaders on campus and in the community."""

Frat,2yenzl,--TheDoctor--,13,Tue Mar 10 04:27:58 2015 UTC,"But it wasn't the students shouting their personal hatred to black people, the song/chant had ""SAE"" in it. That's when it crosses the line. It becomes a hate group. No school president will ever allow a hate group to grow and manifest under their nose. They also have the university's name tied to them. That is a school organization. OU will not have their name tied to racism."
Frat,2yenzl,Hereletmegooglethat,5,Mon Mar 9 17:07:47 2015 UTC,Who cares.  If you and a bunch of likeminded racist idiots band together as a formal fraternity and have the gall to get filmed gleefully shouting/singing racist chants then you deserve to be punished.  OU's president is perfectly within the right to punish these smug idiots.  I'm glad they're targeted so the space created by expelling/punishing these morons can be better used for more moral collegiate activities.
Frat,2yenzl,--TheDoctor--,2,Tue Mar 10 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"So it doesn't get misconstrued, when I said 'you', I meant 'you' as a general hypothetical situation.  Not you in particular.  However if you are part of a school sanctioned group and you are drinking, possibly underage, and are actively bandying hate speech about in a way that it promotes exclusion of certain racial groups from that group then yes you deserve your punishment.   I don't feel bad about the punishment and shame they are about to bring upon themselves."
Frat,2yenzl,Hereletmegooglethat,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"Freedom of Speech is hard, because ONLY speech that is hurtful or offensive or challenging needs protection.  No one believes these idiots were inciting violence.  So I'm having trouble identifying how a State University (which as a State institution is required to observe students' Constitutional Rights) can punish off-campus speech, even if that speech is offensive to the university and the university's values.  In the end, I'd rather tolerate hateful offensive speech from idiots, rather than have my government decide what I can and cannot say in public or in private."
Frat,2yenzl,dontwuwwy,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:01:27 2015 UTC,Plenty of schools have a statement that says violation of the Code of Conduct is grounds for disciplinary action (i.e. expulsion).
Frat,2yenzl,Hereletmegooglethat,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"Very true.  But Codes of Conduct apply on Campus - this was off campus  (just as the recent FIJI Border party was off campus, and therefore beyond the reach of UT's administration to discipline).  Do you think that if you told an off-color joke at your family's dinner table at home, and your evil little sister ratted you out to your school dean in an email or Instagram, that the dean could expel you from college for something you said inside your parents' house?  For State Universities, the students' Constitutional Rights trumps almost anything the college sets as rules.  That's why the OU President cited the two students he expelled for ""creating a hostile learning environment"" rather than for ""hate speech,"" because he likely knows he cannot regulate speech off campus.  The problem with his expulsion of the students is that the WAY the students created what he claims is a ""hostile learning environment"" is through their speech, and ONLY through their speech - he cites no other breach made by the students other than the idiotic racist chant.  I'm not an attorney, but I don't think the expulsion will stand up to a legal challenge.  Again, I'd rather tolerate hateful and offensive speech from idiots, rather than have my government decide what I can and cannot say in public or in private.  Government regulation of speech is a slippery slope.  I think SAE did the right thing by closing the Chapter (and Nationals was clearly within its rights to do so), but I disagree with the University's decision to expel two of the students for off-campus hateful speech.    Edited to add: Law Professors writing both in the ""Washington Post"" and the ""Huffington Post"" seem to agree with me: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/03/10/no-a-public-university-may-not-expel-students-for-racist-speech/  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/racist-rants-and-the-univ_b_6844500.html  How incredibly awkward."

It used to be, because the MTV party was there, but I heard they moved. If the MTV party is still there then hell yeah! I stayed right next to it at the majestic. Great idea, got all the rowdy of the holiday inn, but i could turn back to my nice hotel at any point.  Renting a boat sounds like a bad idea. If anything get some buddys and do deep sea fishing.  Stay on the fucking main roads. Seriously..... People I knew got jumped for absolutely no reason just because they thought it was a short cut behind some building. Highschool spring break was a week after college, but I got there the friday night of college spring break, and let me tell you I have never seen so many people in such little areas on the streets. Stick with a large amount of your brothers and your fine."
Frat,2yiujp,nocookie4u,3,Tue Mar 10 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, I grew up right off of PCB so here it goes.    A. Vela it's worth it if you don't mind overpriced drinks and stay the FUCK AWAY from the pool/foam party. No amount of chlorine in the world can kill what lives in those waters. 175.00 for a week isn't terrible because cover hovers between 15-20 early (think like 6-7) and can go from there (I went a few years ago they wanted nearly 40 bucks). Also, locals stay away from Vela like it is diseased (which it may be) so there are a ton of spring breakers there.   B. Holiday Inn, Yes stay there or somewhere near there. You won't regret it even if the MTV Spring Break isn't there the location in regards to the bars is worth it alone.   C. If you rent a boat know that a. you may get fucked with by the coast guard who are out in force during this time. b. the coast guard hates fun. Worth it to go to Shell Island but honestly there won't be a shit ton of people there as that's where the locals go to get away from the Spring Break crowd best bet is to rent a skidoo out off the beach for a bit or take a pontoon and float down the beach a bit. Women will get on a boat and it's a good ass time if you do it correctly. Personally if I had to rent a boat during spring break I'd rather not.  If you do decide to go down Lagoon Dr. till you see the dive shop on the left where it merges onto Thomas Dr. On the left are a few pretty good boat/jetski rental places.   D. Enjoy yourself I'll be back myself for Spring Break next week as well and I intend on not remember this shit before I head back to law school. Paddy's day is fun as hell definitely hit up Coyote Ugly's.  Keep in mind that every bar will be overpriced so save your money for covers. Also if you ever just want to see a concert at Vela/Spinnakers the beach access by Vela is your friend and it's usually packed. Get the panamaniacks card it's worth it IMO and please stay off the sea oats no one needs a 500.00 fine to go home with.  Finally, Pier Park is a shopping mall let no one fool you elsewise. Yes there is margaritaville and it's cool but it's a tourist trap as is most of the restaurants in there.   Eat at local joints if you can Jenny's One Stop diner (if you wake up and find yourself over by Sharky's) is great food for <10.00 that will cure any hang over. For Oysters and seafood I prefer Schooners (pricey), Sand Bar(meh not too bad), or the Bayou on the Beach (FYI the lunch specials are the tits) I can tell you pretty much off the top of my head the specials I used to eat here so often when I lived back home.   Sorry for the wall of text figured I'd give ya as much advice as possible PM me if you have any questions."

Did the Panamaniac card for $50, kinda sucked because you had to go in between 7-9 when I'm usually at bars at like 10. However, getting into clubs for free was well worth it and I always had a good time. A couple guys in my house went to Spinnakers every night and had fun When I was there, we would go down to the area on the beach next to Spinnakers, where there were lots of people, boobs, and beer. Decent walk from the Holiday Inn, but one you could make every day. There wasn't a ton at the beach outside the hotel, but there was stuff at the pools/hot tubs Didn't rent a boat, didn't really need to. The boat takes you away from people.   There's a Waffle House right next to the Holiday Inn. Go there at least twice for late-night/early morning food.  Stock up on beer early. Get plenty of cases.  BUY BEADS. TITTAYS WILL BE OOT AND ABOOT  Do not bring anything to the beach that you wouldn't mind not bringing back, except for a cell phone and cash.  Ask me anything else.

They are their to help you develop as a gentleman and to help others develop. Partying is something that should be done on a member's own time, some fraternities do hold parties but they should be kept under control and standards still need to be enforced. Unfortunately not every chapter of every fraternity in the U.S. can say they are doing so. But talk to an older alumni, talk to your campus advisor. Read up on what your fraternity stands for and then hold your brothers accountable for what they should be doing before things spiral out of control. Then you can work together to project a better image to your community."

I don't know how no one has said this but you learn an unbelievable amount about how to work with different kinds of people on different tasks when you go into fraternity leadership positions.  You learn skills you could only  learn in an office, lab or maybe a big campus club, but if you fuck up here a party doesn't happen or go as well, instead of getting fired.

The spoils of that process - adventuring with your Brothers, partying, and attracting beautiful women - are the reward for the hard work fraternities demand of their members to constantly excel.  Europe is a mediocracy.  American fraternities are meritocracies.  Done right, fraternity men ARE better than other students.

I might be annoyed that these awful 10 man chapters exist at tiny liberal arts schools, but the fact that my chapter is good is the only thing that actually matters outside of internet pissing contests."

Their actually pretty cool guys, since the shitheads get weeded out during pledge period. I actually approve of their shotgun approach during rush. Obviously sometimes shitheads do get let in, but that's with every organization. Pikes are everything you just described at my school."
Frat,2yhqgh,wergot,5,Tue Mar 10 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"Here they don't have a house yet, and they're about as insular as any of the others, so the opinion among independents (the people who come to their parties) is that they're dicks.  Really they're like the least dickish, but independents really haven't seen just how bad the better respected houses can be."
Frat,2yhqgh,PPKA2757,5,Mon Mar 9 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a pike and have been active at two different universities (transfer student, PAC 12) one being around for 100+ years and the other very recently rechartered and here's my two cents:  We get a shitty rep because of our recruitment policy set by our nationals, they tell us to bid anyone and everyone. This wasn't a problem at my first school since we'd had a lot of experience doing so, so keeping numbers consistent around 100 guys we would bid quality men to replace the graduating seniors. New chapter is the total opposite, give out bids like they're candy and it's a problem. Guys go to our national conventions and eat that shit up, don't get me wrong however 90% of my chapter are cool guys but because we try and recruit so many men, some shit heads slip through the cracks. We have ~150 members plus pledges and although we are graduating a bunch of guys, the amount of pledges we are taking is down right scary to me.   Because of strategies like this you get the small amount of men that give us a bad name because they were able to attain membership, Tennessee, NIU, etc. and it's fucking the rest of us over, hard.  I love being a Pike and all of my brothers and do not regret my decision what so ever. However I'm not ignorant to the fact that we have a shitty rep and that my nationals are a bunch of greedy fuck boys. Don't have much to say about TKE though, every one I've met was a nice guy and they're in the same boat as us."

I'm not saying every member/every chapter is a date rapist, but every year at yalls big party somebody comes away date raped, thats a little skeptical. Plus when I talked to people in much further away areas (West Virginia, and Michigan, I'm in Kentucky.) the same things have happened with the pike chapter there.  History is a big thing for me, and thats why this chapter definitely wasnt for me at my school. One of my really good friends is in pike, and in no way a date raper. If it happens once, you can scoff it off and just say she got really drunk, but when it happens consistantly I get worried.  TKE is non-existent where im at."

If you plan to use it for tailgates and things with a lot of grilling to be done, it isn't hard to make a pit that will last a lifetime. Would probably be cheaper than buying one of a brother knows anything about metal work. Back in high school the welding shop would turn out 15-20 a semester. Plans are all over the Internet and could easily be customized with your letters and shit like that."
Frat,2ygc3f,DatCowGuy,2,Mon Mar 9 19:51:14 2015 UTC,That'd be pretty dope. Problem is we're tearing down our house at the end of this semester to build a new one but a pit would be a sweet addition to the new house. We've got plenty of guys that could do that too.  Right now I'm looking for something to tailgate with in the fall and cookouts in the spring
Frat,2ygc3f,DatCowGuy,2,Mon Mar 9 20:02:34 2015 UTC,I have seen them that are portable units. Basically a pit with legs and an A frame on top with cables and some type of winch system to raise the grate up.

Dead meaning it's designed just to support itself. Rooofs are designed as dead loads, so adding 30 bodies comes close to 4500 extra pounds (assuming an average 150 lb person) will add extra stress and eventually fail."

Frat,2ydzp6,ConcreteKahuna,10,Mon Mar 9 19:39:24 2015 UTC,If it snows at Cal Poly there will be a lot bigger problems then load bearing roofs. The town is situated in a valley 10 miles from the coast (think UCSB climate) I would be more worried about people not knowing how to drive in snow and sliding into buildings.

Frat,2yegq5,monsieur_bienvenu,18,Mon Mar 9 02:38:08 2015 UTC,Sometime in the late 50s into the 60s. At my alma mater having alcohol on the breath while in the chapter house meant expulsion and this was in the 40s and 50s. Go forward a decade or two and there was a collection at Sunday meeting for the Wednesday kegger.
Frat,2yegq5,mcs3831,5,Mon Mar 9 04:08:42 2015 UTC,"As long as there were social fraternities, there were parties. Until the counterculture of the 1960s, they looked like this: http://youtu.be/AiCBd2Vu4Dk?t=3m44s (this aired in 1960).  At around 1962, you started to see students adopt drug use (marijuana, LSD, and some alcohol). Young people saw it as a rebellion of traditional values and traditional American culture (you could also argue that they thought ""the beatniks are doing it, I want to be cool like them""). Fraternities were actually among the last to accept this because they were still rooted in tradition, and it took a long time for fraternities to deal with that conflict.  Binge drinking wasn't a thing until popular drugs started to get banned/harder to find (late 1960's/early 70's). This is roughly when fraternities found a framework for the modern college party. Rock concerts were getting bigger and bigger, and had introduced spectacles like laser lights, fog, and pyrotechnics. Fraternities have attempted to mimmick live concerts for years, though on way smaller budgets.  It's gotten a lot easier since then. Parties that serve alcohol have been made more relevant post-1984 (national minimum drinking age act), audio equipment is now really cheap, the internet has brought us unlimited free digital music, and the internet lets us share videos where we can steal ideas from other fraternities across the country."
Frat,2yegq5,corporat,4,Mon Mar 9 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"When more and more great leader started joining fraternities. They each had to get more competitive to recruit the  top quality men. Thus each began offering more and more ""benefits"" like Brotherhood, friends, networking connections, girls, beer till it eventually reached its peak in the 90's. Now I believe, at least for my chapter, things are getting back to the way it ""used"" to be. Not as many parties but more connections, brotherhood and leadership development.  Plus when you consider when Greek Life was in its Golden Age ie 1940-1950 fraternity's were the social backbone of most campuses. It was the thing to do and the way to meet people ans get involved. Thus leading to more and more socials to entice quality men to join your chapter. If this makes sense..."
Frat,2yegq5,FRALEWHALE,29,Mon Mar 9 03:33:02 2015 UTC,Would the 1940's really be considered part of the golden years? It was my understanding that WWII completely gutted a lot of fraternities and many disbanded because many college aged kids enlisted instead of going to college
Frat,2yegq5,waazd,9,Mon Mar 9 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of fraternity houses across the country were also used as barracks, and a lot of people who were already in school left to fight in the war.   Chi Psi has never been one of the huge fraternities, and we had 4000 brothers serve in the war (4000 who had already been initiated, not 4000 future actives) '43-'45 was the first time we didn't have an annual national convention since they started a century prior. The effects of WWII on college and Greek life in general is pretty fascinating."
