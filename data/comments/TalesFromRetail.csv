Worked at a (unionized) local grocery store chain that he despised while attending M.U. and graduated on track after 4 years of full-time attendance. He quit the grocery store the same day he graduated. Then he bummed around for a bit looking for a ""real"" job, before eventually finding a programming job about 2 years after he left college for a starting salary of $40,000/year + benefits and a 401k with employer matching. His benefits were about $100/month for just him (a bachelor). He was really fucking proud of this, as he should be.   So he was bragging to John and I, and we were being supportive and ""yay, go you!"" as friends should be, and he begins to dog on John, who had never gone to college and who Luke was in a weird pissing contest about regarding that fact. He says, ""See, now, if you (John) had just gone to college, you could be making this kind of money right now,"" in a satisfied/ smug voice.   John (who works for Major Retailer Known for Taking Care of Employees) looks at him, startled, and says, ""I do make that kind of money. I make $5k more a year, actually.""  Luke looks stunned, but quickly recovers. Stammers, ""Yeah, but you don't have a 401k, working retail.""  ""I do,"" said John. ""401k with employer matching. I also have life insurance coverage.""  Upset, Luke slams his open beer down on the table and begins to pace. ""Well, how much does your health insurance cost per month? You have a wife and kid -- it must be through the roof!""  ""It's about $15 a person, per paycheck,"" replied John calmly. ""So right now it's about $45 a pay period, or $90 a month for the family.""  Luke slammed his hand angrily against the wall and turned to scream at John in front of our shocked faces, spittle flying from his lips: ""It's not fair! You cheated! I went to college! I did it right! You cheated!""  ""How did he cheat?"" I asked, stunned by Luke's behavior. ""You worked your way up by going to college; he worked his way up by getting a job and promoting up. They're both valid ways of doing it.""  ""But mine is the right way,"" yelled Luke, looking distinctly wild-eyed. ""Mine is the way you're supposed to do it!""  Our friendships kind of fell apart after that. I suppose it's worth noting that we did have wildly different politics -- he was conservative, we were progressive. Also, his dad purchased his student loans so Luke could pay them back interest-free, whereas that kind of debt-free education wasn't even an option for either of us. So ... yeah.   Anyway. I guess the moral of my story is that supervisors shouldn't have to have BAs. Stores should promote from within. Importing management staff with BAs is just importing classist igoranumuses."

I will say I have been told before by my supervisors and leaders that you need to have a degree to get higher up.

I am 90% sure that I work in the same place as OP, and thankfully they recently did away with that requirement.   I have a degree in biology and somehow that made me more qualified to be a manager than someone who has worked 10 years for the company but never got a degree? I could see if it was in business or management or something, but really? Their reasoning was that it proved you could be dedicated and stick with something for at least four years.  OK, fair enough, but so has the employee that worked for the company for four years.   Edit: I suspect the real reason they wanted fresh college grads so they could exploit and treat them like shit, because it is very likely their first real job and they don't know it doesn't have to be that way.

She's doing just fine now as a manager of a store. She's really good with people (customers and her associates). Not having a degree doesn't mean you can't do the job. And who cares if you went to college or not if you enjoy your job, yanno?   Sorry for the rant. I'm in debt out my ears for schooling that's not doing me much good in life.

This is someone's cart?""   Yesterday when I did this, the woman did the typical response, but still kept going through the cart. I told her one more time, but she didn't acknowledge me. When she picked up a shirt and tried to walk away, I said ""Excuse me, that shirt belongs to the woman in the fitting room right there."" She said, ""Oh! But it goes with these earrings I'm going to buy!"" and still held on to it. We both just stared at each other until she finally dropped it back in the cart and said ""too bad.""   Also, as a note, this woman's cart which was once separated between what she had tried on and what she wanted to try on was now completely a mess of clothes thrown on top of each other. Luckily, she heard the conversation and thanked me for keeping her items safe.."
TalesFromRetail,3dy4ya,Archive_of_Madness,17,Mon Jul 20 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"Good on you.  I remember one black Friday I was shopping with family and guarding carts by the books waiting for the rear service desk to open so we could checkout(they do this during the holiday shopping at this particular store) and this lady comes up and asks if she can get through to look at the books on the shelf.   I say ""sure, go ahead"" and close my eyes for a second(what with it being 3 or 4 in the morning), when I open my eyes again she's casually booking it around the corner with an Xbox and controllers we picked up for my brother and my mom is trying to get her to stop. Then I walk around the corner and say ""HEY. STOP!"" In what my niece and nephew refer to as my ""manly voice"".  Cue lady that took our stuff shitting a brick then turning on a dime to return the pilfered merchandise and giving fake apology to my mother and I and pretending she didn't know the carts were claimed even though I told her not to mess with the buggy when she asked to look at the books."
TalesFromRetail,3dy4ya,Sapphires13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"I work in the healthcare department of my store, so I deal with a lot of very small, high prices items.  I have a large rack full of plastic totes that my freight is sorted by type in, that I pull out onto the floor and stock my shelves from.  Every time I turn around, customers are digging through the totes for some reason.  It's the same stuff that's on the shelves... just not shelved yet.  People seem to just assume the stuff is clearance and think that they can shop out of my totes.  And sometimes they try.  You'd think most people would know that Bandaids are usually sold by the box... not by the ten-boxes-still-shrinkwrapped-together-in-a-bundle.  In other instances of shopping cart mayhem:  before working in the healthcare department, I worked in clothing.  Of course customers trying to take their shopping carts into the fitting rooms was always a problem.  Yes, when you plan to try on five hundred garments, it is very convenient for you to take your shopping cart in with you.  But when you could have expensive electronics and cosmetics stashed underneath the blouses, ready to slip into your purse as soon as you're behind closed doors, that's quite inconvenient to us.  And then there was the time I had a shopping cart full of clothes that had been left at the fitting rooms, while I was putting them out, I had to step away to assist customers.  I parked the cart between racks, out of the way.  When I came back, someone had dumped the entire cart out onto the floor, so they could use the cart.  Because you know, that's easier than just going and getting a cart from the front of the store.  Last but not least, the time we had a tornado and we had to take all of the customers into the back of the store where the lockers, break room, and employee restrooms are.  Space was limited, but we had several customers very upset about being told that they could not take their shopping carts in with them.  We had plenty of space near the doorway leading to the safe back area where customers could leave their carts, but many were paranoid that someone (who? everyone was in the back) would take their things."

I told her ""Well, you must have come on a Tuesday, which is seniors day and gotten the discount."" She insisted she should get the $4.99 credit because no one told her she was getting the discount.

I worked at the customer service desk so if someone didn't receive their discount, they would come up to me. Most often because the transaction had just happened and was so new to the system, scanning the receipt wouldn't bring it up in our computers. So instead of asking these already irate elderly people to unload all their groceries so that we could void them and rescan them at the proper price, we would have to key in each UPC by hand.  One time to void it off their receipt, and then a second time on a separate transaction so that we were able to apply the discount. And of course because my store was awful, the senior discount only applied to certain items so we would have to scan through these three foot long receipts hoping we found every qualifying item.  Senior Tuesday was also the only time I ever got slightly fearful for my life. After management had gotten so many complaints about seniors who had not gotten their discount, we were told to ask the customer if they qualified. So one day I was cashiering and was pretty brain dead because it was near the end of my shift. This couple came through my line who probably didn't qualify, but I wasn't going to risk angering another customer, so at the end of the transaction I asked about the discount and they both glared at me and the guy looked at me scowling and said ""You're going to get yourself shot, boy"".

My store was pretty lax about the military discount until corporate got on us about being lax.   So we were super strict about only accepting the 4 approved types of military ID (for which I got yelled at many times by cranky old veterans, even though I agreed that they should get the discount).   Turns out we were the only store being so strict even though corporate sent the memo about being stricter to every store in my district and my store received enough complaints that the store manager said ""fuck it"" and started allowing every form of military ID to count towards the discount.  So within 2 months we went from being lax (as long as you have something to prove you served and you are in the store) to super strict (you have to be active duty or career military) to ""you get a military discount, and you get a military discount, EVERYONE GETS A MILITARY DISCOUNT!""

I was at a big box store buying a gift card from the express lane. There were practically no lines and I had one lady behind me.  The gift card I grabbed wasn't working so I told the cashier I'd find another myself and to help the next person in line. I was super exasperated so he must have felt I needed help and so he stepped away from the register and came to look with me.  It took around 15 seconds before we returned, since the gift card rack was three feet away from his register.  I'm done in another 30 seconds or so. The lady is making this huge fuss and picking up her items off the belt as I'm grabbing my bags. The cashier tells her:   I can ring you up now!   Sighing dramatically   Oh, so are you done helping her (me) then?   I was already cranky so I shot back:   OMG, wow, sorry for needing assistance from an employee and taking like a whole minute to get rung up. Thanks for being such an adult about having to wait so long!   And then I stomped off. I don't understand, if the service isn't instantaneous you have to throw a fit?   She had more items than the express limit to boot. What a jerk."

When it's the kind, little old ladies that I see every single week who are genuinely seeking some kind of personal interaction or have a hard time with their hands, it's no problem.  If you're the kind of person who waits until I scan everything to tell me ""Ok, just wait I left my purse in the car,"" or know you have your debit card just thrown into your bag and it's going to take a while but you wait until the total, THEN I'm gonna be annoyed."

There's connections for mic and speaker, and I believe 'external triggers'. (Should be used to zoom to specific desks/counters, take a snapshot, then keep filming.)

TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,perpetuality,17,Mon Jul 20 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"Out of interest - and no, I'm not ever planning to do this - how easy would it be for someone to scan & bag at self serve, maybe swipe their loyalty card (so the supervisor subconsciously sees a card being used), then hit cancel on the transaction and push their goodies away?  Would that be easily noticed, if they were casual about it?   Second question is why, when you're short staffed, they don't keep self serve plus one regular till open, so people with little / in a hurry can get through quicker? Is there a reason that I'm missing?"
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,techiebabe,16,Mon Jul 20 08:11:20 2015 UTC,"Cancelling an order needs to go through the person standing around in charge of the self check out, there's 4 there to one person. So I can see it being possible if the person supervising the machines is not paying any attention at all, but not likely.  As for the second question, I have no idea. Up until a few months ago we would almost always have at least two people working until close; one for self checkout and one on a register. Instead they decided it's better to have just one person closing. It isn't busy too often, but it is stressful on those nights when I get everyone wanting to check out at once, since the line can really back up. Scheduling hasn't been in my favor lately, I prefer nights so I don't mind working them but with the new changes lately I'll be alone for a few hours to run price checks, answer the phone, help customers find things and ring everything. Friday nights alone from 9:30 until closing are the worst. So yeah, you're not missing anything it's just stupid. The manager who does the scheduling doesn't think it's busy enough to warrant a self checkout and a cashier, but she still expects everything done, the entire front end clean and all throwbacks away. Mostly it's fine but Friday and Saturdays especially can get bad."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,lc7926,7,Mon Jul 20 08:24:17 2015 UTC,"I work in a home improvement store that has self checkouts. Most people scan cheaper items and leave the more expensive items in the basket, then pay for only the cheap stuff. We're supposed to be watching our screen to see if they ring everything up, but if you have a cashier that doesn't care..."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,LokiKamiSama,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"I also work at a hardware store.  People will wait till self checkout is busy then try and walk out with stuff.  Once caught a guy wheeling out a cartfull of stuff.  I caught him out of the corner of my eye, asked for a receipt and when he kept walking screamed at him to see his receipt.  It got very quiet then and he stopped and turned, giving me enough time to grab the basket and ask him AGAIN for a receipt.  He said they do this all the time and I should call a manager.  So I said okay, and tugged the basket with me. Let's go see that manager.  He walked out.  There was like 2 grand worth of merchandise in the cart."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,PizzaCutter,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"Where I shop, the self checkout machine asks if you want a reciept, I mostly say no.  I once had it error on me after accepting payment. The cashier asked me had I paid, I said yes - because I had, but I declined the reciept. Not sure what I would have done if she'd have pushed the issue.  It meant I had no proof and as the machine had crashed there was no evidence at all. I guess though since they allow you to not get a reciept they need to consider this sort of things happening."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,LokiKamiSama,3,Tue Jul 21 06:58:58 2015 UTC,"There's always a way to reprint a receipt.  Some cashiers might not know how, but their supervisor should and the manager definitely should."

Never had any problems, but I'm also not stealing anything.  What I notice is that if there is an employee checking receipts they aren't even asking customers. People just walk up to them and hand them their receipts. So when I walk by them I just tell them to have a good day or something like that, and they respond in kind. Almost never get asked to see my receipt."

TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,clamsmasher,0,Mon Jul 20 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"No offense taken ;) Checking receipts at the door is just a theft deterrent that inconveniences people who aren't stealing. Sure, the guy in your story stopped and you prevented theft, but most people who steal in this manner just walk right out the door. It's not like you can stop them. And no store is ever going to make a police report because someone didn't stop and show their receipt.   Door greeters/receipt checkers only deter casual shoplifting. Think of it from the customers point of view. There's only two possible situations that can occur when the customer approaches the receipt checker. Either they are stealing or they are not stealing. If they are stealing then there is nothing to gain by getting their receipt checked. They should ignore the checker and walk out the door. If there is evidence of their theft it will have occurred prior to their interaction with the door checker. If they are not stealing then they have nothing to gain by getting their receipt checked. They should ignore the checker and walk out the door. There is already evidence inside the store that they legitimately purchased their goods.  Receipt checkers are just a part of security theater in retail stores."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,Princessluna44,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"If you are not stealing anything, why not just comply? You look suspicious when you don't and it makes their jobs harder, which is unnecessary, in this case."
TalesFromRetail,3dwr2i,clamsmasher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"I explained in another comment already, but the point of the receipt checker is to be a visible deterrent to thieves. They're not actually comparing the receipt to the products in the cart, that would take more time than it does to go through the checkout line. They're also not going to stop you from leaving if you don't show them a receipt, or accuse you of stealing because of that. No retail store tells it's employees to accuse people of theft or to stop them from leaving the store if they're stealing.   I'm not making their job harder because their job is to just stand there and verbally address customers as they leave the store. It's not like the store uses metrics to evaluate an employee who checks receipts.  By itself it's literally the easiest job in the store, deter theft by just standing there and talking to customers.  I figured in a retail subreddit people would be able to recognize asset protection strategies. I'm surprised that anyone here thinks the actual act of checking the receipt has any relevance. Register clerks are trained to check the entire cart for any items the customer may be trying to sneak out, there are mirrors near the floor to assist the clerk in spotting these items, they look inside bins and other items that can be used to hide items, they even have mnemonics and acronyms to help them remember to check for items. Do you really think that the store would then have another employee do the same exact thing less then one minute later? And only one receipt checker to verify every customer that passed through multiple checkout lines?  I don't stop at receipt checkers because checking receipts isn't the purpose of their position."

TalesFromRetail,3dv45t,CozzyC0,45,Mon Jul 20 06:52:13 2015 UTC,It's so ridiculous because even believing in heaven doesn't mean that you can't miss someone. No-one would tell her not to miss her son when he's away at summer camp because he's enjoying himself. It's unfathomably more sad for her when he's gone forever. Whether he's in a good place or not doesn't change that.
TalesFromRetail,3dv45t,wdn,20,Mon Jul 20 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"The people who say these things really are trying to help, they just struggle as much as the rest of us for something to say, and this is the script they have developed.  They understand still having a loved one around would be the better option, but that is not a choice.  Seeing as her son did suffer for so long, it is natural to try to point out that he is free from suffering.  I personally am agnostic at best, but I can appreciate when someone is trying to offer condolences, even if I don't believe or understand the path they follow.  That doesn't make OP's advice to the mother any less valid.  In order to grieve, you must allow yourself to feel the pain, and find ways within yourself to move past it."

I smiled and greeted the lady, sincerely, and asked how she was. She rolls her eyes and scoffs at me and dodges the question. I felt extremely awkward while scanning her groceries, and just as I finish scanning all of them she looks up at me with tears in her eyes and says: ''I've been diagnosed with cancer today. I have three months to live''.   Just wow. How do you even respond to that? Nobody could possibly know what that's like because nobody who lives to tell the tale can know what it's like. But my instincts kicked in and I hugged her, and she held onto me for a few moments. It fucked me up because there was no way to make her feel better; I'm just the guy that's living and she's about to die. I felt like by merely existing right next to her I was mocking her."

They tend to think that rule is for everyone but themselves. I say it in my welcome to the fitting rooms speil, again when they go to take a full basket of stuff into the room, once more when they pull out items from the cart and put a handful in the room. Then again when they come back out to try on more and they still have the first 6 items in the room.   I've heard people in the line up waiting for a room say ""oh they don't really mean 6 items."" We have signs on every door and I've repeated ""you can only take in 6 items"" every time I speak, yes, we mean it! And no, if you ""only have 9 items"" it's still 6 at. a. time.

The print on the sign was huge and clearly detailed what was on sale and what wasn't. Because it was so painstakingly clear, we were NOT to price match the sale on the sign.  Yeah, we had a lot of pissed off customers. Some people would try to lie and insist that the sign said everything was on sale, to the point where I had to physically take them back and show them the sign.

We had laminate wood floors and those stupid shoes marked up the floor. Plus we had plenty of breakable items. I don't know how many times I had to tell kids not to skate or use the wheels while in the gift shop. Every once in a while I'd get a kid who would give me lip about it.  I'd point out all the breakable items nearby and tell him (it was always boys) if he even chipped something he'd have to pay for it. That usually did the trick

The fight is over in only a minute or two with one combatant taking off and the other just hanging out. The guy that took off came back a couple of minutes later and I can see that he is holding a can of pepper spray behind his back. He goes to shake the hand of the other guy and then brings up the spray from behind his back and points it in the face of the other guy. What happened next was pure comedic genius.

She came up to my till and said ""I want to return this."" It was $1.99 and she didn't have a reciept, also our floor works on a system where we print our tags on a new colour each week so we know when it was put out. She said she bought it 5 days ago, we have a 7 day exchange policy, but the tag said it was put out 3 weeks ago. Now we do leave stuff on the floor for a few weeks so it IS possible, but we have no way of knowing that without a reciept. If the tag was a new colour we might do something.  She was talking to my supervisor and kept mentioning its ""only $2, it's not a big deal, but I'm travelling so $2 could get me something like a coffee."" We also explained how it was an exchange policy. So even if she found her reciept there's no cash back. She just kept repeating it was only $2, it was only $2. In the end my supervisor said ""sorry"" for the last time and the customer just grabbed the hat and marched away. I think it just makes customers look grouchy when they do that without saying anything like bye or ok thanks or anything.   All I kept thinking was ""you said yourself it was only $2."""

I used to work at a call center as a supervisor and I was listening to a call connected to a failed customer satisfaction survey as was my job. My agent was having a conversation with a southern lady about her phone suffering water damage. The best part of the call went something like this:  Agent: Just so I understand you correctly you're saying that there's water damage on your phone but the store told you they couldn't order a replacement and you had to contact Asurion (phone insurance)?  SL: Yes. I already told you. And it ain't my fault it happened. You people need to take into account certain facts of nature. I didn't drop it in water or the toilet or nothin'.  Agent: What exactly happened to cause water damage then ma'am?   SL: Well, I typically put my phone in my back pocket and I'm a bit on the bigger side if you will and it's the dead middle of summer. And I'm human so I sweat.   Agent: So you're saying...  SL: It has water damage because of my butt sweat. Yes'm. And I don't see how that's not covered under warranty. It wasn't my negligence that caused it.   At that point my agent put the lady on hold for a very long hold probably trying to find help but it was one of the funniest calls I'd ever listened to. I still giggle thinking about it.   TL;DR: lady felt that her phone replacement should be covered under warranty because her butt sweat was due to natural causes and it isn't her fault the phone had water damage because of it."

TalesFromRetail,3ds4ad,dunmorestriden,4,Sun Jul 19 08:28:07 2015 UTC,If it were a crack that would be one thing...

You can't actually be forced to submit to a receipt check.  For a normal store you are perfectly free to walk right past the checker and out the door.  For a membership store, you can do that as well, however they in turn can revoke your membership for doing so.  I suspect this is why the practice is more common in membership stores than others."

So denying them exit from a specific one is not illigal. If I forced him to stay in the store with out ability to use any of the exits would be false imprisonment, and since he just has to wait for me to buzz him out it does not count as false imprisonment."

Look outside, is it dark out?? If it isn't dark then it isn't 4 in the morning!"

TalesFromRetail,3dsr4w,Jazistico,8,Sun Jul 19 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"I worked at a store that had a mall entrance. The mall doesnt open until 10. They unlock the doors an hour early for mall walkers. Every day I'd get an irate customer at the gate yell to me when I'm walking across the store to open the gate or why is the gate closed our website says we open at 9.  I walk over, explain that we open at 9 but the mall doesn't open until 10 so the gate is closed. They get mad and usually tell, not ask, me to open the gate so they don't have to walk out the mall entrance and 50 feet down the sidewalk to our main entrance. Never worked for a single one.  Then at night I'd have the opposite problem, mall closed 30 minutes before my store so I had to close the gate. I would start 30 minutes early and make an announcement at 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes and right before I closed the gate that the mall is closing and anyone exiting through our mall entrance to please bring their final selections to the register to check out.  Every night I would get a pissed off customer that ""didn't hear"" the announcement and didn't know when the mall closed, could I open the gate for them. My response: Sorry I can't.  It's against mall regulations to open the gate for any person outside of mall hours."

It's 10pm and we're cleaning up, shutters 70% down which should be obvious enough. This lady thought it would be smart to pull them up trying to enter hoping for some service. What she didn't know was that due to a past experience when the store was robbed at knife point, the entire staff was waiting on the other side with clubs, brooms and kitchen knives. Needless to say, we were disappointed with the lack of real targets."
TalesFromRetail,3dsr4w,AutumQueen92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:51 2015 UTC,So in the few seconds it took her to pull up the shutters you all had time to get your weapons and get in position?  Aren't you trained to cooperate with an armed thief?
