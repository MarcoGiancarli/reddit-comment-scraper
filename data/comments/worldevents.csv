The South(33,140km2) has more land than the North(27,574km2) Goveronate. And since the South Goveronate doesn't touch Israel, it's less of a security issue for them. Israel might be willing to agree with this if it means the dissolution of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, something Hamas will probably never agree with.  If a ""buffer"" line/zone is truly necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt and occupy the Northern Sinai province without much issue by the Egyptian locals. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to vetoe this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestians all agreed to this.

And next year, the two state-owned companies that control the energy sector—Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, and the Saudi Electricity Company, the kingdom’s main power producer—plan to jointly break ground on about 10 solar projects around the country.

And if that wasn't sad enough, they triumphantly claim that they will meet this goal twenty years after the fact.   That deal may be a tantalizing sign of things to come, but the goal Saudi Arabia announced three years ago of building 41 gigawatts of solar capacity remains a distant glimmer. In January, Saudi officials announced that they were pushing back the target date from 2032 to 2040—and even with the longer time frame, skeptics have dismissed the goal as a mirage.

But look at things honestly -- is the 2nd Amendment actually doing what you claim?  Let's see how the Bill of Rights is doing:  The 1st Amendment is weakened, the 4th and 5th Amendments are flat-out ignored. Haven't you heard that all of our phone calls, Internet usage and all electronic financial transactions are monitored? The 6th and 7th Amendments are casually and frequently ignored. We routinely ignore the 8th Amendment's provision on excessive bail for even trivial crimes, and we ignore its cruel and unusual punishment aspects on everything from our government's unapologetic use of torture to the writhing prisoners dying from lethal injections. The 10th Amendment was revoked by Lincoln, so I guess that's so old that it's not news.  I'd say the Bill of Rights is in very sad shape -- and the 2nd Amendment is not doing a damned thing. The 2nd Amendment is doing is primarily 2 things:  (1) It gives us a sky-high murder rate that is the embarrassment of the advanced countries of the world.  (2) It gives our evil government a rationale to militarize the police and to put more police on the streets.  The 2nd Amendment stopping tyranny? Clearly that is not happening.  If you think that civilians with AR-15s, pistols and hunting rifles can take on the combined might of the US military and police, you're nuts. We could not overcome the British in the 1700s without French cannons, French money, French troops and French ships; we certainly are not going to overcome the US government by force of arms.  The only resistance to tyranny today is to organize with others -- including sympathetic people in the police and military -- and to withdraw support from a corrupt government. The people of the USSR and Eastern Europe did this, and more recently the people of Egypt (until the US-backed/armed/trained Egyptian military overthrew their elected government).

worldevents,3cay81,zardwiz,2,Tue Jul 7 00:51:20 2015 UTC,I've thought all along they might adopt the dollar. They can use anything they want.
worldevents,3cay81,zardwiz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:52:34 2015 UTC,"They'd have to buy dollars, which is potentially problematic, although they had (or had, unsure if this has changed) 112 tons of gold - that's a fair amount of dollars, even if they only liquidate a part of it.  Doing so brings up other risks, but they're already in high stakes modes.    While the Euro is an easier choice, I can see them wanting to escape it because of where it's brought them so far.  I suppose Europe could implement some type of control, but it's difficult to keep currency within borders anymore.  They could pull somewhere in the neighborhood of $34BB out of thin air with that gold (assuming, of course, that selling that much wouldn't depress markets.)  That might just be enough to get them a starting point in using the dollar."

worldevents,3bukon,bridgesfreezefirst,3,Thu Jul 2 07:22:34 2015 UTC,"The Greeks have repeatedly noted that there are no provisions for leaving the Eurozone, for a member nation to switch to another currency. Varoufakis also said it would take ""months"" for Greece to begin printing a new Drachma,  as they do not even own the printers to do so.  It seems as though they would like to default and remain on the Euro.  Can someone explain what would happen if a sovereign state such as Greece wiped its debts which are owed in no small part to other members of the common currency region? What is the legality of doing so? What would the political and economic fallout be like?"
worldevents,3bukon,MagikalGoat,5,Thu Jul 2 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"If the Greeks default while keeping the euro, their credit rating will go to shit (nobody will lend them any money). Without any money they cannot run their government. Government services will likely stop running for at least a couple of months while they try to restructure the government and attempt to generate some revenue from any source they can. While this happens there will likely be chaos in Greece itself as essential services fluctuate in their availability. Likely, they will not succeed in finding sufficient income and liquid cash to run a government from restructuring, and be forced to print the Drachma.   Ignoring what their finance minister said about not being able to print the new currency, their situation becomes infinitely easier once they exit from the euro as they may just print more money to pay for their bills and services. This probably results in a period of inflation. People with deposits in banks will have their balances converted to the Drachma, likely devaluing much of their savings.  Printing the Drachma will put the Greeks back in control of their own monetary policy as well, giving another tool that they may drive the economy with. Assuming capital controls are properly established and people do not take their money elsewhere, the Drachma will stabilize if the Greek government is able to maintain sound fiscal and economic policy (big if). In summary, Greece will suffer through a period of instability if the referendum result next week is a no, but if properly managed, having control of their own currency will be a boon to their economy in the future."
worldevents,3bukon,Drumheros,3,Thu Jul 2 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"If there is no future for Greece in the Eurozone, why do you think the Greek government keeps making these strong statements about the lack of exit provisions?

worldevents,3bukon,MagikalGoat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say that there's no future for Greece in the Eurozone. The best possible outcome for Greece in this situation is to stay in the Eurozone, and receive their bailouts without any of the austerity that the rest of Europe demands. Greece benefits quite a bit from being in the Eurozone, being an important shipping and trade hub because of their central location between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Trade with Eurozone countries accounts for for ~40% of their import/exports. There's some very strong incentive for Greece (and the Greek people) to at least continue to negotiate with the ECB/IMF. From what I can see, their claims about the lack of a exit mechanism is a tactic to buy time to push the EU decision at least until after their referendum."

worldevents,3b7im2,theelous3,14,Fri Jun 26 23:05:53 2015 UTC,What does this comment even mean?  Vatican City is a sovereign nation that just signed a treaty with what it is recognizing as another sovereign nation.
worldevents,3b7im2,mors_videt,-4,Fri Jun 26 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"The Vatican city, while technically  an independent nation, is probably the least deserving area of land holding the title of nation.   The entire state's economy is souvenirs and entrance fees, it's head of state is only listened to symbolically and even then only by practitioners of Catholicism or those looking to be friendly with that side of things. It doesn't have embassies, armed forces or police. It doesn't participate in trade agreements or have a GDP with any meaning whatsoever. It houses less people than the small housing estate down the road from me and the lives of those few people is identical in every way to that of the average Italian a few doors down. There is one Judge, and when somebody commits a crime they are arrested by Italian police, and held in Italian prisons.   The whole thing is a very very contrived nod to the pope that everybody goes along with simply because he's the pope and that's how things were done in italy in the 1920's.  I find it farcical that Palestine, a large and legitimate nation would be given the a-ok by the Vatican like it carries any weight. Palestine has been recognised as a legitimate state by the majority of the UN for years.  End of the day, it's a nice gesture simply because it will encourage the religiously entwined members of government of states that have yet to recognise Palestine in the UN to go ahead and do so, so I can't fault the Vatican for not doing the right thing. I just find the whole situation bizarre."
worldevents,3b7im2,theelous3,7,Sat Jun 27 00:47:56 2015 UTC,"Your attitude is at a 10. If you backed it off to about a 4 then you would just come off as intelligent.  I don't agree though. The issue in this case really just is sovereignty in my opinion. Palestine is still acquiring legitimacy and recognition, piece by piece and one of the things that sovereign nations get to do that subject territories cannot do is sign treaties with other nations.  If it was Monaco signing a treaty with Palestine it would be noteworthy, but Vatican City has the additional symbolic weight to anyone who cares about Catholicism or- as you say- anyone who cares about old, mostly obsolete tradition."
worldevents,3b7im2,mors_videt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"First off, all context, tone and idiomatic subtleties are completely lost in the the great leveler of internet comment sections. Were you with me you would find I don't really have any bad attitude or particularly strong feelings about the whole thing.  My point being, the next time you think you have a dead read on some guy on the internet, take a step back and realise you have no way of telling satire from prose or tongue in cheek from sermon, as long as it's coming through the interwebs.  Secondly, I never said this:   anyone who cares about old, mostly obsolete tradition.   Well, I did sort of, but not that strongly. Some of the old decrepit traditions at play are wonderful documents granting / declaring sovereignty and establishing communities etc. etc. which is lovely. Big difference between tradition and religion, but that's a whole other thing.  On to the main point. In the eyes of those who keep track of these things, like the UN and individual county's foreign relations branches, I have no doubt at all that the Vatican city is recognised by almost all of them as completely legitimate and my saying it is ""not a real"" nation is technically incorrect.   But really though, come on. It's fuckin' tiny and has shares almost no traits with a real country. To an observer who had no knowledge of the situation regarding the Vatican, it is very likely that even when presented with the law of the land and the country's finances they would have a hard / impossible time discerning if they were still in Italy looking over the books of a large business or in a separate nation prying through the budget breakdown.  Were I a mover and shaker in the Vatican, I would have done this a long time ago. In fact, I'd have done it three years previously when most of the UN got on board with it, and I'd have known about it because as a mover and shaker in the Vatican, I would know I share the same perma. observer status as Palestine in the UN and I would do my best to extend the same respect to other 'fledgling' nations that the UN was so kind to grant me, especially given my somewhat shakey legitimacy as a sate.1 I'd have identified with it from the get go because I am a morally righteous man acting on behalf of a state who claims very plainly to want to imbue the UN with a sense of morality and fairness in its decisions.  But no. I'm not a mover and shaker in the Vatican. The movers and shakers over there seem to be sedimentary monoliths backing a horse that doesn't need backing after it's over the finish line.  A nice gesture too late, but it might have a positive impact in the long run. Hopefully.    1 Personal opinion of course. I would hope the diplomats for the Vatican have the self awareness to at least consider this viewpoint. You can't stand shoulder to shoulder with giants as a flee and not understand the true position of things without an unhealthy lack of perspective."

worldevents,3auq2i,albed039,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:23:24 2015 UTC,"The things that stuck out at me were how this kind of mostly maps onto the economic landscape of Europe; with a few exceptions, the growth of France vs Germany that it basically reversing the historical shift that was going on in the 18th, 19th and 20th century where Germany was the 'up and coming' power in terms of population and political/economic power, the French government has invested lots into promoting population growth and supporting new families. The split between East and West Germany is interesting also, is this because people are leaving the East to go into the West.   Also the State of the Baltic states even before their 'internal devaluation' really kicked in, that has to be caused by emigration of younger people right? You can see similar things going on in many of the countries that are recently incorporated into the union Poland seems to be the exception to this, I wonder why this is (and I'd expect similar things to be going on in the former Wasaw pact countries excluding Russia and Belarus following the trend there).  Is this emigration aswell? I'm not sure because of the ex-soviet trend.   There is also a big disparity between North and south Italy that reflects the economic situation I guess, but it is less pronounced in the 'closer look' map with the mountainous central countryside having an effect, the same kind of thing is going on in Spain with the coast and the north and north east regions.   It's also interesting that most of the places that are growing in the ex Yugoslavian states are in Kosovo and Macidoniaa."

I'd say the burden of proof is on you to show that these women are CIA agents acting on behalf of the US Government to discredit a man known to facilitate the leaking of classified documents. You claim they weren't victimized all you want but the Swedish justice system has upheld the arrest warrant after several appeals and hearings which to me suggests there's enough evidence to proceed with a trial (considering if there was clear evidence this was a set up the warrant would be suspended nay?)
worldevents,3anjvd,Fofolito,4,Mon Jun 22 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"Oh come you, you can't be so stupid as to think there's anything substantial to these charges, do you?  If so, why did the 'victims' wait years before making these allegations against him? You don't think it's fishy that the rape accusations, which no had said anything about for years, came literally weeks after Wikileaks leaked the US diplomatic cables?  They're just looking to silence him on bogus charges because he's politically inconvenient."
worldevents,3anjvd,emergency_poncho,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:46:57 2015 UTC,"I believe they're entirely substantial. Multiple hearings in the Swedish   justice system have upheld the warrant to arrest him in relation to these charges. Seeing as though the Swedes have a pretty good reputation as being some of the least corrupt people on the planet I think this is a good thing.   Also, if you look at the behavior of victims of sexual assault if they report it at all they tend to do so months or years after the intial attacks take place. They are traumatized emtionally, often intimidated physically or mentally, and aren't exactly excited to let everyone know they were violated. In terms of victims of individuals who are politically or culturally powerful you often see them come out years and years afterward, sometimes at the urging of rivals who see benefit in the downfall of the perpetrator (which I'm entirely willing to believe the US is taking advantage of for personal gain but that doesn't in-substantiate what Assange allegedly did to those women and should have his day in court)."
worldevents,3anjvd,Fofolito,2,Mon Jun 22 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"I don't deny the strength and integrity of Sweden's justice system, but Sweden has been known to repeatedly bow to American pressure when the US wants something done. I think the (relatively recent) raid on The Pirate Bay's servers is a good case in point. So I wouldn't at all be surprised if the US is putting incredible pressure on the Swedish authorities to prosecute Assange."
worldevents,3anjvd,emergency_poncho,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"No, I entirely believe they are but the charges against Assange and the fact the US is pressuring for the arrest are not mutually exclusive. Think about it like this: With the world watching Assange could have his day in court, a UK court to be sure but with diplomatic guarantees of his safety (no extradition), and the women he allegedly attacked can see the charges against him tested. Either he's found guilty and Justice is served or he's found not guilty and Justice is served. If Assange never goes to court and these charges are bogus then there's no harm but if the charges are not bogus and he doesn't go to court then we've proven yet again that victims of sexual assault have no value and no recourse against powerful men."

""Everybody should understand that we are living in a totally different world than two years ago,” said Alexander M. Golts, an independent Russian military analyst.   He probably means before regions (ahem, Ukraine) became destabilized because of neighboring nation actions.    “In that world, which we lost, it was possible to organize your security with treaties, with mutual-trust measures,” he said.    ""Which we lost,"" it's not hard to lose when you give it up willingly. The rest of the developed world is still using treaties and trust measures to ensure safety; the fact that they don't agree with Russian hostilities towards neighbors (and previous allies) is not indicative of those measures not working, it means Russia is being a hostile nation.   “Now we have come to an absolutely different situation, where the general way to ensure your security is military deterrence.”   This is a blatant excuse to increase Russian military activity.    “We are doing exactly what our Western partners are doing.”   No, the US isn't annexing Mexican territories and sending soldiers on invasive vacations. More excuses.   “We can feel the military tension,” he said.   Because Russia is the center of the tension in the area.    Nearby, Alexander Zaldostanov, the leader of the Night Wolves motorcycle gang and a Putin favorite, was taking in the exhibition, standing not far from equipment like sample S-300 antiaircraft missiles. In Soviet times, he said, the military was a closed structure, so it was great to see it being modernized and popularized.   And here's what it gets you, Russia, state-sponsored terrorists fighting alongside your soldiers in neighboring nations and glorifying that it's being ""modernized and popularized.""  You want to know why NATO members are nervous and stationing armaments in allied nations neighboring you? It's because you're being belligerent towards your neighbors and NATO members support one another.   When I come here and see all this, I realize that we have something to answer with,” he said. “This fills you with pride for Russia and confidence that no matter what they deploy, they will never dare push the button.”   The difference is NATO is storing tools to fight destabilizing of the region, you're storing nukes and pointing them at a nation.

Russia lies to its north, and US-backed Japan and South Korea to its east. All of these countries have powerful competing interests in the region. That China is taking such tremendous risks just to secure possession of a few largely indefensible islands in the South China Sea shows just how weak is the position from which it's starting."

From The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower by Michael Pillsbury:   Induce complacency to avoid alerting your opponent. Chinese strategy holds that a powerful adversary, such as the United States today, should never be provoked prematurely. Instead, one's true intentions should be completely guarded until the ideal moment to strike arrives.   Another thing touched on in that book is their development of programs that can cripple the enemy on the cheap.

At 13-14 boys are often way way behind girls in many aspects of brain development. Many men don't catch up with the girls until their mid twenties.   So of course many adult men lack certain faculties. Our school's are asking them to learn things they are not capable of.

As many others here have pointed out there's this bias of trying to raise up women but men be damned.  The simple fact of the matter is that a poor, uneducated woman who has children in rich western countries is taken care of by the state. It's easy to look at unemployed men and say they are lazy or useless while a woman is not similarly judged. There are many double standards in play today.  The destruction of the manufacturing base in western countries has led to widespread unemployment. It will still take time for people to adapt. A wider adoption of vocational employment and more opportunities for men to learn and earn will do much to solve the problem. Trying to make men adapt to a system that is designed for women or for those with an IQ at least a standard deviation above the norm isn't going to go well. The system needs to adapt to the needs of men and not the other way around."

worldevents,380h1b,North_Korea_Expert,6,Sun May 31 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"I'll post what I commented on the article here:  'There are two points I would like to address:   The underlying motivations behind China’s support of North Korea The changing dynamic in Sino-NK relations since 1985.   Regarding the motivation, China provides aid to North Korea because China values stability over change, not because they have any ideological support behind North Korea. It’s simply a logistical issue; the cost to China of supporting North Korea are less than the cost of allowing North Korea to collapse. This cost-benefit analysis is gradually diminishing and as you mentioned, there is internal Chinese upheaval over the status of their relationship with North Korea, amongst scholars, journalists and academics.  China is becoming increasingly westernised and is now the largest player in globalisation, meaning that they have dozens of economic motivations behind every move they take. North Korea is but one of many of these.  Regarding the state of their relations in recent history (since 1985), there is an extremely pronounced decline in their relations, mostly in regards to North Koreas ongoing pursuit of nuclear proliferation. I believe this has been the main bone of contention between North Korea and China. There have been multiple, significant instances of China withdrawing avenues of support from North Korea, such as their closing of North Korea’s primary exchange bank in Beijing in the mid 2000’s (forgive me but the exact date doesn’t spring to mind.)  I would go into more detail but I wrote my dissertation on this exact topic, which I implore you to read. The title of this is ‘North Korea and China: A Beautiful Friendship? An analysis of how the Kim regime’s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons has effected their relationship with China between 1985-2013.’  Please let me know if you’re interested in reading this, I’d be happy to send it to you. I’m very interested in discussing the issue of Chinese-North Korean relations.'"

worldevents,380h1b,genuinepolitician,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"Heya Kaael! I'm glad you enjoyed the article and found time to write up this thoughtful response! I agree the ""North Korean issue"" is just one of many issues on Chinese decision makers' plates. You're right that China values stability of the Kim regime over change. I think we need to think hard about exactly what ""cost"" China is looking at in North Korean collapse, and I wonder if they measure it in terms of ""Kim's regime is better for us than a unified Korea"" rather than in terms of a few hundred thousand or handful of million immigrants in the event of destabilization. (China has ~3 provinces adjacent to North Korea, each one already having a population equal to or greater than the whole of North Korea.)  I think the Chinese ""warnings"" to Pyongyang are better judged as theatrics aimed at Washington and the outside world, and not actual indicators of any change in policy. Trust and predictability are highly valued in diplomacy, so words usually mean action--but sometimes they are used as a smoke screen to accomplish some other foreign policy goal. In this case, I believe China's actions show it to be supportive of North Korean attempts at undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts and undermining consolidation of the security situation in East Asia than it lets on publicly. What do you think?"
worldevents,380h1b,Kaael,3,Mon Jun 1 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"and I wonder if they measure it in terms of ""Kim's regime is better for us than a unified Korea"" rather than in terms of a few hundred thousand or handful of million immigrants in the event of destabilization.   I think at this stage, China don't necessarily have a problem with a unified Korea. In many areas, their economic ties with South Korea are more prosperous than their trade with the North, which is becoming increasingly one sided. I'm confident that they don't have any ideological issues with a unified Korea; those who claim that China doesn't want a US ally on their border have woefully outdated Cold-War logic.  It's the transitionary phase that China take issue with, for fairly obvious reasons as you stated in your article. As it stands, the cost of transition is still too great to be worth the benefits of a unified Korea. I'm confident that this balance is fairly rapidly (in Chinese political terms) changing.   I think the Chinese ""warnings"" to Pyongyang are better judged as theatrics aimed at Washington and the outside world, and not actual indicators of any change in policy.    I think this rhetoric is very US-centric and not consistent with Chinese policy. China has no reason to appeal to the US, or the West generally. They have strong diplomatic and economic relations with them, they have nothing to prove to Washington.   I think the reason behind the slow change in policy is simply the sheer scale of Chinese bureaucracy. Many assume that the one-party system employed by China streamlines the political process. However this is still a country of 1 billion+ with over 1000 political representatives in total, which means that attitudes will be very slow to change. I believe it's simply a case of the political lagging behind the social, as it is with anywhere else in the world. The public opinion always shifts before the political system follows suit.   It's clear that Chinese attitudes towards North Korea are changing. I think expecting this process to move quickly is too optimistic, given the circumstances. I'd rather have a slow, peaceful transition than a quick and bloody one.   EDIT:   I believe China's actions show it to be supportive of North Korean attempts at undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts and undermining consolidation of the security situation in East Asia than it lets on publicly. What do you think?   I think that non-proliferation is absolutely in Chinas best interest, specifically in regards to North Korea. China have mostly acted as a restraining influence on North Korea throughout the whole situation.   The US have only antagonised the situation further, which from the perspective of the Kim regime legitimises their pursuit of nuclear weapons and contributed greatly to the 'security dilemma' that has plagued North Korea since the inception of the nation.  I would go as far to say that out of all of the players, China have the biggest vested interest in non-proliferation and have come the closest to unilateral disarmament out of any of the members of the non-proliferation regime.   I have a hard time believing China have any hand in undermining the non-proliferation regime because of this. I simply can't see what they would have to gain. Again, I believe you have a very US-centric view which doesn't aptly represent the situation. I would say that the 'theatric' warnings China issue to Pyongyang aren't underhanded intrigue but more empty warnings that they know North Korea won't regard, but do out of a sense of duty/responsibility towards the situation."
worldevents,380h1b,Kaael,0,Mon Jun 1 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, and I really enjoy discussing this with you. These are tough issues--if they weren't, we would already have the solution and wouldn't be here debating it.   I think this rhetoric is very US-centric and not consistent with Chinese policy. China has no reason to appeal to the US, or the West generally. They have strong diplomatic and economic relations with them, they have nothing to prove to Washington.   It's U.S.-centric not only because the U.S. currently holds the most power in the current international system, but also because a great deal of U.S. foreign policy actions are driven by counter-proliferation and other modern-day liberal principles. If the U.S. is intent on sanctioning North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear program, it's soon going to start talking publicly about why we aren't doing the same to China--unless there are token efforts China can point to to say they are doing something, even when designed to be the bare minimum and implemented only when pushed.  Because none of these minor signals have done anything to stem the tide of major actions China takes on a continuous basis to support the regime that I wrote about in the blog post, I don't interpret this as gradual change in Chinese attitudes towards North Korea.  I think we agree that China doesn't want the Kim regime to go away. We just disagree on whether China's opinion on the matter is changing. Judging by the facts on the ground, I don't think China is doing anything but continuing support for the regime full-blast, while running interference for them on the international stage to keep them from hurt. As long as China's image isn't getting tarnished, they're not going to change their attitude.  So that's my take on what's going on. It doesn't have to be the only interpretation. I'm most curious to find out what parts of my argument you don't find persuasive. They may form the basis of a later article. :)"

But this doesn't explain why China would want to appeal to the US with their actions towards North Korea. I would also say their counter-proliferation motivations are dubious at best, considering their nuclear relations with Israel.    the U.S. currently holds the most power in the current international system   That's another debate for another time :P   If the U.S. is intent on sanctioning North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear program, it's soon going to start talking publicly about why we aren't doing the same to China   As I said, China are vehemently anti-proliferation, arguably moreso than any other signatory of the non-proliferation treaty. Bear in mind that China was the first nation to suggest opening a dialogue with North Korea via the six party talks to begin with and has been the biggest advocate in re-engaging them since North Korea's refusal to attend more of these talks in recent years.   The 2013 nuclear test also saw China act unilaterally by closing the North Korean Bank of China account, followed by the halting of the three largest banks in China halting their exchange accounts with North KOrea; this action was the first of it's kind to be undertaken independently of the UN Security Council resolutions and has shown China's willingness to act unilaterally.   I would hardly say this is a token response, considering that no other nation has acted taken unilateral policy steps towards North Korea so far. You could argue that China is the only nation in a position to implement these policies due their relationship, but that's a structural factor and I don't believe it diminishes the significance in any way.   I think we agree that China doesn't want the Kim regime to go away. We just disagree on whether China's opinion on the matter is changing.   I think we also place the different motivations for China's ongoing relationship with NK at different priorities. I'd argue it's far more out of necessity and for China's own wellbeing rather than any sort of loyalty to NK.   Also consider that China is the ONLY nation with regular access to the North Korean regime, and they do not want to compromise this with actions perceived as antagonistic, especially as their entire engagement strategy with North Korea revolves around discourse, discussion and diplomacy.    It doesn't have to be the only interpretation. I'm most curious to find out what parts of my argument you don't find persuasive.   Ultimately I think we have different views of how the North Korea situation should be handled. I believe that the US and their antagonistic policies towards North Korea are only escalating the situation, further pushing North Korean brinkmanship and in the eyes of the Kim regime, further legitimising their desire to obtain and possess nuclear weapons.   I believe the China view of engaging in discourse and opening channels of dialogue is at least the path with the best intentions, even if it bears little fruit presently.   I feel like i'm basically repeating my dissertation at this stage so please do read it if you get a chance :P It seems like it would be right up your street. I wrote it because there is/was no substantial analysis of the North Korea/Chinese relationship over time, specifically in regards to nuclearisation. There's tons of analysis on all these issues in isolation, but none I found that examine all 3 aspects.   If you don't get a chance to read the whole thing, the conclusion beginning on page 35 effectively sums it up quite succinctly.   I'm in the same boat in you that it's a fascinating topic and ultimately there is no correct solution, as you stated. It's an interesting one to speculate on because we can never know all of the facts and elements in play, due to the opaque nature of the NK government.

Israel is one of the most democratic countries in the world, in terms of directness and plurality of citizen representation. It is considerably closer to democracy than the United States, which has only 2 major parties and 1 representative per about every 565,000 citizens (as compared to Israel's many major parties and 1 seat per about every 66,000 citizens). If foreigners don't like and cannot understsnd the choices that that democracy makes, maybe they should try a bit harder to understand why the choices were made.   The occupied Palestinians are not citizens, therefore they don't vote in Israeli elections. They can vote in their own elections, to elect people to negotiate with Israel.

What HSBC did is not adequately investigate and report on some groups that were opening bank accounts.

They have to punish anyone who could be considered a ""drug trafficker"" and the punishment has to be commensurate to other drug crimes.  Logically: Despite the fact that many legal substances, habits, etc, are both addictive and destructive, illegal drugs are easy targets. They're great scapegoats and, thanks to years of media scare tactics and political focus, they're automatically viewed as ""bad"" by a large portion of the population. What we should be doing is making all addictive and destructive things subject to the same laws as drugs.  Morally: Up to the individual, but the US was founded as a bastion of free will and self-determination of her citizens. If you get addicted to drugs, someone else can help you, but it's not any government's job to do so.  They're not irreconcilable goals, it's just that few people are willing to take the responsibility of addressing all of these points - which is a problem when they're still willing to act simply on pragmatic goals."

worldevents,37rkcq,macnlz,2,Sat May 30 10:42:59 2015 UTC,"Did he really?  The way I read the article, he was charged with “soliciting murders”, but this sentence did not include that charge. I’ll consider him innocent regarding this charge until he’s proven guilty.  The six deaths also mentioned in the article are a separate thing: some people died due to drug overdoses, after taking drugs they bought on his site. He’s as guilty of those deaths as he is of the “collateral damage” due to violence in the drug producing nations. In my opinion, that maybe amounts to something like manslaughter, but certainly not murder."

And if Silk Road hadn't existed, the same exchanges would have been going on—perhaps to a lesser degree, but in more destructive ways, with gangs selling in alleys and street corners instead of civilized people dealing entirely within their own homes and the postal system."

It never stopped politicians judges prosecutors or cops from drinking, it just criminalized a common behavior. Other drugs are also fairly common, and the war on drugs created and funded organized crime as well as justified a surveillance state (think of the children!) So while drug dealers killing their competitors and breaking the bones of people that owe then money is very very very bad, I don't really think selling drugs itself is worthy of life in prison or the death sentence and I definitely don't want to pay 60k a year for decades to house somebody in max security because they made their own Ebay site for drugs. The market to buy drugs already existed; he didn't create a market. He didn't advertise to new potential clients, spamming them with ad banners. The market was there.

In 2009, he was the subject of a civil court case in the United States.[31] Another photo shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner.[31] Other photos show interrogators sexually assaulting prisoners with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube, and a female prisoner having her clothing forcibly removed to expose her breasts.[31] Taguba supported United States President Barack Obama's decision not to release the photos, stating, ""These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency.""[31] Obama, who initially agreed to release the photographs, later changed his mind, as he believed their release would put troops in danger and ""inflame anti-American public opinion"".[31]  In other instances of sexual abuse, soldiers were found to have raped female inmates, and senior U.S. officials admitted that rape had taken place at Abu Ghraib.[33][34] Some of the women who had been raped became pregnant, and in some cases, were later killed by their family members in what were thought to be instances of honor killing.[35] In addition, children were raped in front of their mothers.[36]   You're a stupid, ignorant fuck and you should feel like a stupid, ignorant fuck."

IS has a state run and state sanctioned program which undertakes the kidnapping, enslaving, raping, torture and murdering of civilians who were not enemy combatants, for the crime of their ethnic religion. This is a policy openly enacted throughout all of their controlled regions with the goal of ethnic cleansing and enforcing an extreme anti-woman state policy. By comparison the US had a much smaller, state run and sanctioned program at a small number of black sites which involved enemy combatants, and their goal was extracting pertinent information.  While the population of Abu Ghraib was large, the abuses were being carried out by a small number of guards, and likely did not involve more than a few detainees, perhaps in the order of hundreds. That is not easily comparable to the thousands of women enslaved by IS.  The simile above directly compares the events of Abu Ghraib with the events in IS controlled territory, and uses the one to mitigate the other. This argument is analogous to pointing out the murder of surrendered Japanese soldiers during the war in the pacific and using it to mitigate the atrocities during the rape of Nanking."

That kind of brute manipulation of the political process would be a serious mistake, further weakening the country’s battered democracy and tainting whatever victory might emerge.  After more than a decade of amassing power as Turkey’s leader, Mr. Erdogan could be on the verge of realizing his dream of changing the Constitution to make the president, rather than the prime minister, the leading political authority. His party, known as A.K.P., would have to win 330 seats in Parliament on June 7 — a three-fifths majority — to take a proposed constitutional change to a referendum.  The party won only 326 seats in the last election in 2011, and on Friday Reuters reported that the most recent poll by the research firm Konda suggests that support for A.K.P. has declined.  Photo  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey Credit Dado Ruvic/Reuters Mr. Erdogan has a long history of intimidating and co-opting the Turkish media, but new alarms were set off this week when criminal complaints were filed against editors of the Hurriyet Daily News and its website over a headline Mr. Erdogan had objected to. Referring to the verdict in the case of Mohamed Morsi, the deposed president of Egypt, it read: “The world is shocked! Death sentence for president who received 52 percent of the vote.”  Mr. Erdogan, according to Today’s Zaman, said the headline suggested that he could face the same penalty; Mr. Erdogan was also elected with 52 percent of the vote in 2014. Not only is the accusation distorted and absurd; it is a slap at the idea that Turkey is still a democracy.  A lawyer and A.K.P. supporter, Rahmi Kurt, had asked prosecutors to investigate the Hurriyet editors, accusing them of “inciting people to armed rebellion against the government” and requested their arrest. Since the complaints were made, there has been no arrest. In a statement, the Turkish Journalists’ Association faulted the government for equating journalism with terrorism and said the move against the newspaper was a “new blow to press freedom and free speech.”  On Monday the prosecutor in Ankara called for a ban on several opposition media outlets associated with the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Mr. Erdogan’s who is now in self-imposed exile in the United States, according to Reporters Without Borders. Ekrem Dumanli, the editor of Zaman,one of those media outlets, was arrested with scores of others last December and accused of leading a terrorist organization. Some journalists fear the government plans to use antiterrorism laws to shut down Hurriyet, Zaman and their parent companies — the two main independent media sources — ahead of the election and confiscate their assets.  Journalists aren’t the only ones who are worried. On Thursday, leading labor unions expressed concern about security for the June election, saying that in the quest for victory, the A.K.P. party had mobilized government institutions on its behalf and sought to depict the opposition as the “enemy” during campaign rallies and speeches.  While the country has faced tough political campaigns before, this one is especially vicious and the mood seems unusually dark and fearful. Mr. Erdogan appears increasingly hostile to truth-telling. The United States and Turkey’s other NATO allies should be urging him to turn away from this destructive path."

worldevents,36ol77,Truthbot,2,Wed May 20 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Israel begins separating Palestinians, Israelis on West Bank buses   Not exactly.  From the article --  ' According to the plan, Palestinians who entered Israel from to [sic] work via the Rayhan, Hala, Eliyahu and Eyal checkpoints may now only return to their homes via the same checkpoints through which they left the West Bank. They will also no longer be allowed to ride common buses with Israelis to the West Bank. The pilot is expected to last three months, after which it will be reviewed.  ' Until now, Palestinian workers who had entered Israel could have return to the territories any way they chose. ...  ' Over the last few years, the Samaria Settlers Committee, along with Ariel resident and newly minted Likud MK Oren Hazan, has conducted a campaign calling for separation on buses.  ' Previous GOC Central Command Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon rejected their claims that traveling on common buses constituted a security risk. Alon's position had been that as these workers were already in Israel, in the event any of them were dangerous and wanted to conduct an attack, they could do so anywhere inside Israel and not necessarily on a bus home in the West Bank.  Last October, Haaretz reported that [Defense Minister Moshe] Ya'alon accepted the settler committee's claims and ordered that all Palestinians who entered Israel at the Eyal checkpoint exit there as well.  ""You don't need to be a security expert to realize that 20 Arabs on a bus with a Jewish driver and two or three passengers and one soldier with a gun is a set-up for an attack,"" Ya'alon said in response to criticism.  ' Haaretz also revealed the minutes of a subcommittee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, in which Karnei Shomron council head Yigal Lahav said: ""Arab travel on buses is a victory over the Jewish occupier"" and that it gave them ""the experience of traveling with Jewish women."" ...  ' The program had been slated to take effect in late January, but it was delayed due to bureaucratic issues at the Civil Administration. The inclusion of three checkpoints in addition to Eyal was made for legal considerations, in order to protect the plan from possible High Court appeals.  ' The Defense Ministry was concerned that the state would have difficulty convincing judges that the separation was based on security and not ethnic grounds, due to the army's stance that there is no security risk on the buses in Samaria and in light of the racist remarks that accompanied the idea of separate buses.  ' The state can now argue that the plan, which includes four checkpoints at various geographical locations, is a security necessity and is slated to ensure that all workers return to their homes.  ' Human rights organizations plan to appeal to the High Court against the new directive. '    [My emphasis]: 'They will also no longer be allowed to ride common buses with Israelis to the West Bank.'  This is not about West Bank buses and it is not about buses traveling inside Israel.  This is about buses traveling from Israel to the West Bank. Palestinians who enter Israel at the Rayhan, Hala, Eliyahu and Eyal checkpoints may now only return via the same checkpoints through which they left. Time will tell whether this plan (which is expected to be reviewed in three months) is a good idea in reaction to security concerns or a terrible idea for terrible purposes, but the headline from Ha'Aretz is misleading (which is not all that unusual in the Ha'Aretz English edition).  A few years ago, a West Bank bus company introduced express buses that went directly to-and-from villages and larger places of work. This was met with cries of 'Apartheid!' despite the fact that no one had to use those buses and were free to chose buses that made more stops."

Once lifted the major powers will still have leverage against Iran's government as similar sanctions could be imposed if Iran goes too far in expanding it's influence & power through proxies or support of terror groups etc.   Naturally they are fearful that the US may disengage from the reason because, it would appear, they are incapable of defending themselves.

worldevents,35l14t,munkijuice,8,Wed May 13 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add to the section on ""What’s the political background to this?"".  During the last government (we just had an election which the Conservatives won with a narrow majority, 36.9% of the vote) our phone and internet surveillance powers were ruled a breach of human rights by the ECHR. In response to this the government passed emergency legislation to ensure they would continue to be enforced, although the Conservative coalition partner the liberal democrats forced certain controls such as an expiry date. The previous government also tried multiple times to pass the Communications Data Bill, dubbed the ""Snooper's Charter"" by opponents. The bill would massively extend the government's surveillance powers:   The original data communications bill required internet and phone companies, including those overseas, to retain for 12 months all traffic data tracking the internet and phone use of their customers, including weblogs. It also required them to make the data available to the police and security services.   The home secretary Theresa May promised to pass the CDB once it was clear the Conservatives were likely to have a majority, before the election results had even finished coming in. Clearly this would be completely against the ECHR. Other Conservative manifesto plans such as disenfranchising prisoners would also be against the ECHR.  In addition, thanks to the whistleblower Snowden our intelligence and security organisation GCHQ was recently ruled to have been breaking the law for several years. The human rights organisations from around the world who brought the case to court plan to appeal to the ECHR in Strasbourg later this year with hopes of an even stronger ruling."

If the Soviets were expecting that he would and felt they couldn't defend eastern europe alone (and that Britain and France would continue with appeasement) then sadly the pact makes sense in that from a Soviet perspective dividing Poland in two was better than fighting Germany alone or leaving all of Poland to the Nazis and the baltic nations as potential nazi allies (re.

worldevents,352nit,TheGhostOfTzvika,1 point,Wed May 6 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"From the article --  '  For civilians, drones are the safest form of war in modern history. As I’ve documented before, they’re more discriminating and more accurate. If you want to minimize civilian casualties, getting rid of drones—and steering warfare back to bombing and shelling—is the worst thing you could do.  ' Look at the record in Pakistan. The harshest tally of drone strikes, maintained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, says drones have killed 2,449 to 3,949 people there, including 423 to 962 civilians. If you work with the low-end figures, that’s a civilian casualty rate of 17 percent. If you use the high-end figures, it’s 24 percent. In Yemen, the bureau counts 436 to 646 deaths by drone, of whom 65 to 96 were civilians. That’s a rate of 15 percent. If you factor in other incidents classified as possible but unconfirmed drone strikes, the rate in Yemen drops to somewhere between 8 percent and 14 percent.  ' The New America Foundation keeps a different tally. Its figures imply a civilian casualty rate of 8 percent to 12 percent in Pakistan and 8 percent to 9 percent in Yemen. A third count, maintained by the Long War Journal, indicates a 5 percent civilian casualty rate in Pakistan (once Weinstein and Lo Porto are added to the tally) and 16 percent in Yemen.  ' Compare those numbers with any other method of warfare. Start with an apples-to-apples comparison: the Bureau of Investigative Journalism’s analysis of “other covert operations” in Yemen. According to BIJ’s methodology, this category consists of nondrone attacks by U.S. forces, “including airstrikes, missile attacks and ground operations.” BIJ counts 68 to 99 civilian deaths in these operations, among 156 to 365 total casualties. That’s a civilian casualty rate of 27 percent to 44 percent: three times worse than drone strikes in the same country. Or look at the bureau’s data from Somalia. For drones, the BIJ counts 23 to 105 casualties, of whom zero to five were civilian. For other covert operations, the BIJ counts 40 to 141 casualties, of whom seven to 47 were civilian. If you go with the low-end numbers, drones have a perfect record in Somalia. If you go with the high-end numbers, drones are seven times safer than the alternatives.  ' ...  ' Before the emergence of drones and other precise weapons, war was far more dangerous for ordinary people. In World War II, an estimated 40 to 67 percent of the dead were civilians. In Korea, the estimate was 70 percent. In Vietnam, it was about one civilian for every two enemy combatants. In the Persian Gulf War, it may have been no better. In Kosovo, it seems to have been worse. In Afghanistan, civilian deaths have been estimated at 60 to 150 percent of Taliban deaths. In Iraq, civilians account for more than 80 percent of the casualties. To be fair, these were full-blown wars. You can argue that the better alternative to drone strikes is diplomacy, not invasion. But you ought to credit drones, conversely, for providing a military alternative to all-out war.  ' Last summer, Israel took extraordinary measures to avoid killing innocent people in Gaza. But the results were still horrific. According to a postwar investigation by the Associated Press, Israel’s 247 airstrikes on residential buildings killed 844 people. Of these, 508 were women, children, or men aged 60 or older, “all presumed to be civilians.” If, in exchange for that presumption, you posit that every dead man between the ages of 16 and 59 was an enemy combatant, that’s still a 60 percent civilian casualty rate. A broader U.N. tally, counting 1,483 Palestinian civilians among 2,205 total casualties of the war, puts the rate at 66 percent. '"

About a quarter of those suffer from severe illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and the rest from less debilitating ones, such as mild depression or anxiety. But mental ailments are far less likely to receive treatment than physical ones. Over three-quarters of those suffering severe conditions, and over 90% of those with moderate ones, are treated by non-specialists or not at all (see chart 1). ...  . The resulting misery is huge. Put together, mental illnesses account for more suffering and premature death in rich countries than heart disease and strokes, or than cancer (see chart 2). One study estimates that depression is 50% more disabling than angina, asthma or arthritis, as measured by a health score that combines factors such as reduced mobility and pain. Men with mental-health problems die 20 years earlier than those without, according to the British Medical Association, mostly from causes other than suicide. That is partly because mental illnesses make physical ones tougher to treat, and because sufferers often live less healthily. Research has linked even moderate levels of stress to lower life-expectancy. ...  ' ...  ' ...  ' Over the past few decades some rich countries have moved away from housing patients with severe psychiatric conditions in asylums and started opening community centres and care homes, and hiring more social workers and mental-health nurses. Australia, Britain, Italy and the Nordics have largely completed the transition. Japan, Korea and most countries in eastern Europe have barely started.  ' Though the idea was sound, in some countries community-based care was not ready before institutions closed. America is perhaps the starkest example, and the consequences are visible in its criminal-justice system. In 44 states the biggest mental-health institution is a prison, and police spend much of their time dealing with the effects of untreated mental illness (see article). But it is not the only one. British police spend as much as two-fifths of their time dealing with cases that involve mental illness, though few have the necessary training. Across Europe, 40-70% of prison inmates are mentally ill. '"

Hamas and/or Islamic Jihad stored rockets in schools that were in active use by children. During the war, former PLO lawyer Diana Buttu famously said on Al Jazeera that “the rockets that were found in the schools in UNRWA were schools that are not being used by anybody—school is out, I’ll have you know.” However, in the UNRWA Gaza Beach Elementary Co-educational “B” School, on 16 July 2014, the UN Board of Inquiry notes that the school gate was unlocked during the period leading up to the incident “in order to allow children access to the schoolyard.” School was out, but UNRWA was inviting the children back in to play.  ' . Hamas and/or Islamic Jihad fired rockets from UNRWA schools. In the Jabalia school listed above, the board found that “it was highly likely that an unidentified Palestinian armed group could have used the school premises to launch attacks on or around 14 July.” Similarly, concerning weaponry stored at the UNRWA Nuseirat Preparatory Co- educational “B” School, the UN inquiry found that “the premises could have been used for an unknown period of time by members of a Palestinian armed group”  — and that “it was likely that such a group may have fired the mortar from within the premises of the school.” '"

worldevents,33zli7,TheGhostOfTzvika,5,Mon Apr 27 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"From the article --  ' “The central facts of the story are straightforward,” says Thomas de Waal, a Russophile scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank, in the introduction to his objective and meticulously researched account of the Armenian tragedy and how it has played out in modern times. “The Armenians were an ancient people, whose homeland was centred in what is now eastern Turkey.” In 1913, there were up to 2m of them in the Ottoman empire. At the start of the first world war, the Ottoman government ordered their mass deportation. A few years later, Mr de Waal writes, there was barely one-tenth of that number in Turkey. The rest had been exiled or killed.  ' A plethora of academic tomes, memoirs and novels about the genocide exist, including Turkish government-sponsored propaganda purporting to prove that most of the Armenians died of hunger and disease during their forced march to the Syrian desert in 1915.   Mr de Waal navigates through some of these. Yet, unlike many, he does not set about legislating history. Rather he offers the wider context in which what Armenians call Meds Yeghern, or the “great crime”, unfolded. (He uses the term “great catastrophe”, which has riled many.)  ' ...  '  Mr de Waal’s biggest contribution is his overview of the interlocking phases of Turkish and Armenian history after 1915.   ' ...  '  Mr de Waal reluctantly concludes that the killings do come under the United Nations Convention on Genocide. He believes the “G-word” (this last term was coined by a Turkish diplomat) has become “both legalistic and over-emotional”. It obstructs “the understanding of the historical rights and wrongs…as much as it illuminates them”. But according to Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor killed in 2007 by a young ultranationalist, Turkey’s main problem is not whether it should deny or acknowledge that what happened amounted to genocide, but what its people comprehend. That is true, but only up to a point. Turkey has recently begun making conciliatory gestures to the Armenians. That would never have happened had the world, and especially America’s Congress, not held the possible charge of “genocide” over it.  '"

The repercussions of the Chinese 'slowdown' will be felt globally while their economy adjusts from the freakish behemoth it has been for the last decade to something that seems in control and manageable. The major commodity exporters to China are facing huge changes as well, the boom for energy and raw materials has ended and will never rise to the same levels.  So who's next?

Notice all major news outlets report the same thing -driving the idea Russian economy is suffering, and the Russian people are blaming it on the root of all evil which is the Russian president. Russia is sending troops into a foreign country because it wants to take over the world. To live in Russia is now considered maybe only a little better than to live in the war torn Middle East. Soon, Russian people themselves will be stigmatized like Arabic people after 9/11. Russians are boorish, stupid, and soon enough, they are attacking American freedom.   So, what is the USA trying to justify? It's not weapons of mass destruction this time. We know the Russians have a shit ton of those. Who is profiting from this? I thought at first the USA was getting back at Russia for Syria, or that it was a move to gain geopolitical advantage via Ukraine, but it wouldn't last this long I think, if it were either of those. Follow the money. Notice Germany an France don't seem to get it, but the UK does. What in the flying fuck is so important, it's worth risking WWIII for?"

The Russians are way too far away from all of that for it to have any impact. They don't speak English and they don't know what we are saying.  What does have an impact is when they don't have any money.  Honestly, the Crimea thing is just a sign of a past trend where Russia tried to gobble up all sorts of European nations as soon as it had any power.  The logical thing to do is to take that power away from them so they don't start taking over all these little countries again. If that happens then you really will have world war III.  Even if Russia is completely isolated and broke they only have themselves to blame. They have the biggest and richest country in the world. How can they manage to starve when they have that? It's their own mismanagement.  Sorry the Russians have to pull up their socks and modernize. This will help them, now that they've had a taste of the future, they won't want to go back to the 80's USSR."

VZ didn't care, because we have such a loose trade system with each other. Then Iraq was invaded, and VZ dropped the idea all together.  That's one of the many things we don't like about VZ.

worldevents,338a2a,GiveYourBestEffort,6,Mon Apr 20 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Couldn't watch this. The texts people use to justify this will never disappear. It is code written into a religion, a kind of dormant mentality that can be taken up wherever people enter into certain basic assumptions and accept certain conditions and experiences. There is an unending stream of people who have ""what it takes"" to get into this in this way.  So what does it take? Can we start going deeper than the end result, the bullet in the air, the passport, the flight booked? Ca we get closer to the declaration of the inevitable ""need"" to kill and die for the cause? Can we start to develop handbooks for seeing the signs earlier on? Or for confronting the basic psychology here?   After the Holocaust, many philosophers took it upon themselves as a matter of urgent responsibility to talk about the origins of totalitarianism and fascism. Can we start to get more deeply into the origins of this, what is called ""extremism"" (a term I find inadequate)? Shouldn't there be more extensive anti-extremism projects, wikis, courses, even degrees? Shouldn't there be more in the schools to confront more deeply the kind of thinking involved here? While this can not be taken into the hermetically sealed heart of radical, violent extremism, the outer areas could be encroached upon with a more intensive and deeper dispelling of the enchantment that operates in the development of the staunch, faithful adherent.  The attempt to make war on these people seems doomed to failure, even while there is ""progress"" here and there. Leaving aside the fact that this probably wouldn't have happened without the military interventions in the area to begin with, interventions that have, unfortunately, showed the practical necessity of the iron fists that the dominant dictators and tribes always use, we at least must begin to accept that fighting this head on is like trying to stop bullets in the air rather than at their source. The source is not the supply of arms, it's the supply of hearts and minds as these are provided in the self-selected, as well as those whose resistance to the hopeless and often fatal allegiance has been whittled down to nothing by living in a war torn region that only grows with each military initiative.  This can not relieve us of the necessity of reckoning with the basic logics of deep nonviolence. I won't go into it here, aside from this one, crucial logic: we must accept that the greater urgency and weight must be seen in the soft. The greater mortal gravity, the kind of with which we currently are currently preoccupied only when there is blood, beheadings, gassings, bombings, etc., must be seen and felt in the soft realm of psychology, education, beginnings. It must be recognized because it is true and it is indeed of a mortal charge.   In the words of the poet, the best lack all conviction. Only when the best, the able, the moderate, the caring, those who know better and see beyond the extremists -- and we are legion -- grasp that beneath their feet is the very rumbling they insist only occurs in battlefields, only when they understand that the knives at the throats of the victims here are waving directly in front of them in the everyday things, in classes, in books, in attitudes, in the fateful steps of indoctrination, separation from family, dreams of battle and world domination, dreams of heaven and hell, of kingdoms and ascendence, only then will the work that must be undertaken be felt as pressing on us.   For those with the eyes to see, this single turning is the most important thing of all. This, in which the calm world realizes that it is charged. Here, where nothing is happening. Nothing at all."

From that position of weakness they were able to negotiate a favorable deal that allows them to continue with their nuclear program. It's little more than a speed bump.

I'm not sure what you mean by those terms, but the US is the only country to have used nuclear weapons and they chose to do so targeting civilians. I assume they were balanced and secure when they chose to do this? The US also has had tons of weapons and even nuclear fuel go missing, so evaluating what ""secure"" means and then evaluating which nation states are secure and which aren't seems like an impossible task.

Of course their air force will occasionally buy new jets. The French developed jets they currently fly were designed 40 years ago. Apparently the author has no interest in crunching the real data, because maintenance costs and the general age of the fleet are critical to an air force. Why even discuss the topic without these numbers?  Some of the arguments are just piss poor. Just because the author thinks the best way to fix relations with Pakistan is through increasing exports doesn't mean that defense can be ignored. The entire point of the military in most modern countries is to be ready to act in cases where other options have failed.

So if somebody says something bad about your country you a) feel directly attaced, in bad cases of patriotism even personally blamed (when objectively there is no connection and no personal attack/blame) and b) reject these bad things, because you and your country would never do something like that (even if they obviously do), you just won't belive it (Cognitie dissonance, that's a psychological thing).  There is a reason for everything - it's not that easy to just drop one's belives and move on; you have to have a certain level of self reflection. Example, assuming the reader is american: Just imagine the difficulty one has in admitting that the american forefathers ( are right there on that genocide list somewhere right next to Hitler.

worldevents,31lis7,hughk,2,Mon Apr 6 09:58:17 2015 UTC,"For those seeing the paywall:   ISTANBUL — A cold drizzle fell on Istanbul on the morning of Dec. 10, 2014, as Abdullah Bukhari made his way to teach his students at a madrasa nestled amid apartment blocks and hardware stores in the Zeytinburnu neighborhood. A white prayer cap on his head, Bukhari made two crucial departures from his daily routine, according to one of his students: He told his bodyguard to stay at home and he didn’t wear a bulletproof vest beneath his white ankle-length thobe.  Two security cameras captured what happened: As Bukhari waited for someone to let him into the madrasa, he glanced to his left, settling for a moment on a clean-shaven man in a black winter cap and blue jeans, both hands tucked inside the pockets of a black jacket.  Three months earlier, the 38-year-old Bukhari had been told he had a price on his head. Two former Chechen rebels living in Istanbul had learned that the Uzbek imam was on a list of assassination targets — men wanted for their opposition to Islam Karimov, the president of Uzbekistan. Bukhari took the news well. “If Allah wants me dead, I will die,” he told one of his students.  Bukhari looked away and the man in the black jacket got his chance, shoving the silencer of his 9 mm handgun between the imam’s shoulder blades. A puff of smoke appeared. The gunman bolted down the street as Bukhari stumbled into the madrasa, dying shortly thereafter.  The long arm of Islam Karimov had caught up with him.  Since settling in Turkey 12 years earlier, Bukhari had opened five madrasas across Istanbul and developed a sizable following among the city’s conservative Central Asian diaspora. His students numbered in the thousands, and included Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Chechens. Well-versed in Islamic law and theology, Bukhari used his sermons to extoll the virtues of jihad against Vladimir Putin in Chechnya and Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The imam welcomed the widows of Syrian rebels — Arabs and Central Asians alike — with open arms, offering them financial support and holding them up as an example for his students of sacrifice for jihad.  Bukhari also called for a movement to bring down Karimov. The 77-year-old former Communist Party boss is the only ruler Uzbekistan has known since gaining independence in 1991. Karimov has held onto power by imprisoning thousands of opponents, accusing many of being Islamic extremists. More recently, he has fingered his opponents as supporters of the Islamic State.  The Uzbek president’s unrelenting pursuit of his critics has pushed peaceful opposition out of the country. For a man known to boil his critics alive, a usurper lurks around every corner. He has even imprisoned his globe-trotting, pop-singer princess of a daughter, Gulnara Karimova. On March 29, Karimov was re-elected to a fourth term, the second time he violated a constitutional two-term limit. Western observers criticized the election, in which the president won more than 90 percent of the vote, with a turnout of 91 percent.  Pious old Uzbek dissidents pray for the president’s life to end, while others hone their skills as jihadis in conflicts across Asia and the Middle East. In the last decade, thousands have joined militant groups fighting in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and over the last few years, hundreds of battle-hardened Uzbeks have joined the Islamic State in its effort to establish a theocracy in Syria and Iraq. Many of the Uzbek jihadis have teamed up with Chechen rebels who hold Russian passports.  Bukhari fell somewhere in between. He expressed hope that the war in Syria would end with Islamist rule, but warned against infighting among the rebel factions and rarely mentioned the name of any particular group, either the Islamic State or the other al Qaeda affiliates.  As members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional political and security agreement, Moscow and Tashkent cooperate closely in tracking and countering militants. Member states readily extradite fugitives to other member countries and share intelligence on counterterrorism operations. Thousands of troops from Uzbekistan, Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan take part in annual “Peace Missions,” retaking towns under mock terrorist occupation. But Tashkent and Moscow have also used less official means of countering this threat — and silencing enemies of the state.  According to Istanbul police and investigators at the Turkish newspaper Yeni Safak, the man who killed Bukhari was Zelimkhan Makhtiev, an ethnic Chechen and Russian national who was part of a team of at least four being paid $250,000 and led by an Uzbek intelligence officer who goes by the code name Misha.  Last year, according to the Istanbul police, Misha ordered a Russian, Sobir Shukurov, to assemble a team to assassinate at least four Karimov critics — three Uzbeks and a sympathetic Kyrgyz imam. Makhtiev’s inquiries about the dissidents raised enough suspicion among Turkish police that he was deported last fall, but he obtained a forged Ukrainian passport, and on Nov. 4, 2014, he and Shukurov returned to Istanbul, according to Turkish police. Makhtiev, Shukurov, and another Russian national, Eldar Aslan, are now in police custody. Police recovered documents in Russian and a short biography of each target, along with pictures and their locations.  The Turkish Interior Ministry forwarded inquiries about Bukhari’s murder to the Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. The government of Uzbekistan refused repeated requests for comment for this article.    At a protest a month after Bukhari’s assassination, thousands of demonstrators held up the imam’s portrait alongside those of other assassinated dissidents from Uzbekistan and Chechnya. The crowd, composed mostly of Central Asian migrants, chanted, “Putin is a murderer, Karimov is a murderer!”  “Naturally, everyone is afraid,” says Adem Cevik, the president of the Turkistan Union, an advocacy and support group for the 140,000 or so Central Asian migrants living in Istanbul. “These kinds of things happen all the time, not just in Turkey, but in Russia, in European countries, too. We are not afraid for our own lives, but for the future of our movement.” Along with helping secure residence permits and providing medical care, the Turkistan Union lobbies for democratic reforms in Uzbekistan and other former Soviet countries.  “Karimov is behind all of this; he has the Russians take care of his problems,” says Muhammad Salih, 66, head of Uzbekistan’s outlawed Erk (“Freedom”) Party, once the country’s largest organized opposition. After Bukhari’s assassination, Turkish police contacted Salih and his son, Timur, 34, to inform them that their names were included in the list of targets obtained from the assassin.  Salih, who ran unsuccessfully for president against Karimov in Uzbekistan’s first post-Soviet presidential election, escaped an attempted assassination by Karimov’s men in 1993. He then fled the country and lived on the run in Western Europe. In 2000, Salih barely escaped another assassination attempt in Norway. On several occasions, European diplomats have intervened to keep him from being extradited to Uzbekistan. Salih now lives in Istanbul with his family.  “This threat is more direct and more dangerous than ever before,” Salih says. Bukhari’s killers were caught with photos of Salih’s son, and a satellite image of their Istanbul home. The usually media-friendly dissident has gone largely incommunicado, and now travels with a rotating team of plainclothes bodyguards. “They are professionals,” he says. “Basically, they [the assassins] kill us, or we are going to kill them. There is no other choice.”  Dilorom Iskhakova, 60, one of Uzbekistan’s leading human rights activists, knows how Salih feels. She fled her country last fall after her daughter was arrested. She now lives in a small seaside town in Turkey, where she was placed by U.N. asylum officials. But Karimov’s regime hasn’t left her alone, she says. She receives threats by phone from a man speaking in broken Turkish: “Lots of swear words, and threats to kill us, to rape us, describing the house where we were living. Sometimes in five minutes there were up to eight calls, starting at 2 a.m.”    According to Human Rights Watch, there are at least 10,000 political prisoners in Uzbekistan’s jails today, the largest number in any post-Soviet country. Around 9,500 of them stand convicted of violating regulations on religion. Simply being caught reading religious texts in public — whether the Quran or the Bible — can lead to terrorism charges, according to Steve Swerdlow, a researcher with the group.  “These are essential politically motivated charges — in the Soviet sense — against an individual seen to be disloyal,” Swerdlow says. Tashkent has denied requests for a visit by a U.N. special rapporteur on human rights since 2002, and the Red Cross stopped visiting prisoners in April 2013, calling the attempts “pointless.”  Meanwhile, Karimov has pursued his critics across Europe and Asia. Scores have been extradited under pressure from Tashkent. In 2011, a court in Almaty, Kazakhstan, extradited 29 devout Uzbeks back to their country, despite appeals from human rights groups. The Uzbeks were quickly convicted and handed prison sentences of up to 15 years each.   --->Continued in reply"
worldevents,31lis7,hughk,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"Part 2 of extract   In 1994, Kazakh authorities extradited Murod Juraev, a former Uzbek opposition parliament member, to Tashkent, where he was convicted of training militants. Juraev was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but his term has been extended four times, for offenses like “incorrectly peeling carrots.” Regular beatings have taken a heavy toll on Juraev’s health: He is missing most of his teeth, and has contracted tuberculosis, according to researchers at Human Rights Watch who interviewed his wife after she visited him in prison in October 2013.  Those who cannot be extradited are kidnapped, like Salih’s brother, Muhammad Bekjanov, one of the world’s longest-jailed journalists. In 1999, Bekjanov was kidnapped by Uzbek agents in Kiev, brought to a court in Tashkent, and promptly sentenced to 13 years in prison for “threatening the constitutional order.” In 2012, he was handed a five-year extension for violating unspecified prison rules.  Despite decades of near-absolute rule by Karimov, Salih says he continues to hope for a peaceful political transition in Uzbekistan. The March 29 elections, he says, could have been an opportunity for Karimov to step aside and allow such a transition, but because Western powers like the United States continue to offer Tashkent military aid and see it as an ally in combating Islamic extremism, no such development has taken place.  “The United States does not look at the long term,” says Salih. “In the long run, this will cause more harm to them.” The alliance between Washington and Karimov, Uzbek opposition leaders fear, will lead more young people to join militant movements with global ambitions.  Karimov has demonstrated how far he is willing to go to hold on to power. In May 2005, in the eastern city of Andijan, soldiers carried out what at the time was one of the bloodiest government massacres in modern history. After a handful of armed locals freed 23 businessmen from prison, soldiers opened fire on thousands of demonstrators, killing around 600 civilians.  In the wake of the massacre, Western countries cut off the bulk of their funding for Karimov’s military. Since 2003, the U.S. Congress has made direct military aid to Uzbekistan subject to annual reviews of its human rights record, standards that the Karimov regime failed to satisfy even before the Andijan massacre. But military-to-military cooperation, including training for the Uzbekistan military for counterterrorism and counternarcotics operations, continued, largely because Karimov had allowed American troops to operate out of the Karshi-Khanabad air base near the Afghanistan border.  After the Andijan massacre, the European Union halted military aid and slapped a visa ban on top Uzbekistan officials. The United States openly demanded that Tashkent allow an independent investigation into what happened at Andijan. Karimov responded by evicting U.S. troops from Uzbekistan.  But by 2011, when Pakistan shut down a major NATO supply route to Afghanistan, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was again meeting with Karimov in Tashkent. The Karshi-Khanabad base was still off-limits to American troops, but congressionally mandated restrictions on military funding were lifted. Tashkent received $5.3 million in U.S. military funding in 2012, $1.6 million in 2013, and $1.5 million in 2014.  This January, U.S. officials said Uzbekistan would receive 328 armored vehicles — worth, depending on their condition, up to $300 million dollars, making it one of the largest transfers of military aid to any former Soviet country in the region. The State Department has since defended the transfer, describing its relationship with Karimov as one of “strategic patience.”  “We believe that we can continue to cooperate with Uzbekistan on common threats like terrorism and narcotics smuggling while also pressing the government of Uzbekistan to make progress on human rights,” a State Department spokesperson told Foreign Policy in a statement late last month. “The government of Uzbekistan knows that our bilateral relationship cannot reach its full potential absent significant progress on human rights.”    Islam Karimov’s war on imams didn’t begin with Abdullah Bukhari. One of the few challenges Karimov faced in 1991 — after he rigged the presidential election and jailed or expelled most of his political opponents — was a nascent Islamist movement in the Ferghana Valley, one of the most conservative parts of Central Asia, spilling across Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Islamists there, some with combat experience in the war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, had been unabashedly calling for sharia law. A group of Islamists even shouted down Karimov during a public debate in December 1991.  Karimov moved quickly, banning opposition parties like the Islamist Renaissance Party and jailing clerics, forcing prominent Islamists to flee to Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The most violent among them formed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), and based themselves out of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where they found allies among the Taliban in the late 1990s.  While the IMU has been an active participant in combat in neighboring countries, Karimov’s zero tolerance for any Islamist movement inside Uzbekistan has meant that the group has been largely absent from its home. In fact, the IMU’s name is now more or less a misnomer — most of its members are thought to be Chechens and others from across Central Asia.  And yet Karimov has continued to use the group’s reputation to pursue his political opponents: Salih and Iskhakova have repeatedly been charged with being leaders in the group.  Uzbekistan’s campaign against an imaginary Islamist threat threatens to create a real underground Islamist movement, says Swerdlow. “The spectrum for Islamic thought and practice is narrowed to the point of strangling the religious community there, pushing it deeply underground and strengthening the position of organizations that are openly looking to overthrow the regime and even worse, committing terrorism,” he says.  Since 2011, hundreds of Uzbeks have joined thousands of others fleeing political and economic marginalization in Central Asia and seeking to establish a new state in Syria. Some support the Islamic State, while others have pledged allegiance to independent, Chechen-led factions. Most make their way to Syria through Turkey, where a network of supporters provide them with temporary housing and transportation, and even find them spouses.  Bukhari, the imam assassinated in Istanbul in December, had amassed thousands of Uzbek, Tajik, and Chechen students, including some who were actively part of that jihadi support network. In his lectures, Bukhari cited dozens of classical Islamic sources to argue for jihad.  But the imam didn’t support all jihadi movements equally. He occasionally criticized harsh tactics used by the Taliban and al Qaeda, and he walked a fine line when it came to the Islamic State: Last July, he produced a series of lectures refuting a much-heralded fatwa condemning the Islamic State by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, one of the world’s most influential Sunni scholars. After citing evidence showing that Qaradawi chose the “idolatrous” idea of democracy over an Islamic caliphate, Bukhari systematically picked apart the fatwa’s main contentions about whether or not a caliphate could be established in Syria, without ever concretely defending the Islamic State’s attempt to do so.    Lately, Karimov has attempted to rebrand his decades-long war on dissent as a war on terror. On Dec. 10, 2014, the same day Bukhari was gunned down in Istanbul, Karimov hosted Vladimir Putin in Tashkent. The Russian president announced that Russia would write off $865 million in Uzbek debt. At a press conference after the meeting, Karimov praised Russia’s leadership in regional security, and warned that “representatives of the Islamic State group have penetrated into Afghanistan from Iraq and Syria,” and that they would enter Central Asia next.  Many say this will increase opposition to the dictator and create more jihadis, rather than fewer. “In a context where [recruitment for the Islamic State] is actually on the rise, the Uzbek government is doing exactly what it should not be doing,” says Human Rights Watch’s Swerdlow.  Uzbek human rights activist Dilorom Iskhakova agrees. She says she knows of at least one case that proves it: Ruhiddin, whose name has been changed to protect his family in Uzbekistan, was in his mid-30s when he was killed in action late last year in Syria. He had left Uzbekistan for Turkey more than 15 years ago, Iskhakova says, hoping to start a new life. Despite being a graduate of a prestigious Tashkent technical university, he could not make a living.  When an Uzbek police officer was killed near Ruhiddin’s hometown in 2011, authorities detained hundreds of practicing Muslims from the area. “It’s very easy to find these people,” Iskhakova says, “because anyone going to a mosque, anyone praying, is on a list.” Among those arrested were two of Ruhiddin’s brothers, one of whom later died in prison, according to Iskhakova. In 2012, Kazakhstan extradited a suspect in the killing of the police officer to Tashkent. Ruhiddin, sensing he might be the next one to find himself in an Uzbek court, left for Syria.  “I don’t know exactly what pushed him [to join the Islamic State], but I understand his condition,” says Iskhakova. “[For] people who go [to Syria] and start fighting, for them it’s a choice to die in prison in Uzbekistan, because they never let you out, or do something different with your life.”"

The service sector (steadily growing, while manufacturing continues to decline) so much operates 7 days a week in the west nowadays that the expectation of a Monday-Friday presence followed by a Saturday-Sunday absence is no longer relevant for a great number of workers already.  As more and more people work Wednesday-Sunday workweeks (or whatever alternative, accommodating the need for Saturday/Sunday workers), the idea of a four day workweek becomes no less difficult to schedule than a five day workweek.  Because the ""everyone is here Monday-Friday, and everyone's off Saturday/Sunday"" model is something only to be found in the proportionally shrinking manufacturing sector, government, banks, and certain other non-service industry niches."

It is time for the southern countries to break free of German imperial exploitation while they still can."
worldevents,31574v,corathus59,4,Thu Apr 2 08:40:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in almost everything you wrote but the southern countries weren't saints, they aren't just victims.  EDIT: Also out of curiosity I went to check you number, I don't see where you got those 30B nor the 300B..  Debt rose sharply in 2008 and 2009, as did with all PIGS due to international financial crisis and huge budget deficits that were masked to look smaller than they were.  The first loan was of 110 B€, later because things were getting worse and worse they got another bailout of 109B€ + 48B€ to private loans to revitalize economy, while at the same time, 50% of the debt up to this point was counted as lost, lowered interest rates and extended the maturities.  So 209B€ + 48B€ have been loaned into their economy/government. The debt would be around 340B€ at that point but 100B€ were forgiven in order to keep debt around 120%.  It's true that Germany uses EU to fuel their economy, it's true that most EU regulations help mainly Germany, that even with these loans German Banks were profiting like bastards. But Greece hasn't been making the best policies to fix their budget issues unlike other PIGS countries."

worldevents,31574v,mors_videt,3,Thu Apr 2 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"Off hand, I can't.  Most of my information regarding my positions on this issue comes from personal experience.    The anti-austerity position is complicated...  For a long time in Greece, the politicians sold themselves to the people with entitlement programs and massive public spending.  Just like every where else, this was a very successful tactic, and Greece developed a de facto system of labor concessions in exchange for votes.  Unfortunately neither side looked very far forwards; labor was perfectly willing to make demands beyond the actual productive capacity of the nation, and the politicians were perfectly willing to give them what they asked for.  And when everyone was getting richer, it wasn't a problem because you could just pass the buck on to the next guy.  Not your problem.  Then comes 2008, and the good times ended.  Suddenly Greece is in really bad financial shape, and needs money.  The EU is willing to give us some money to save their own asses; but nothing comes free and there are conditions attached.  In not so many words, they consist of 'get your shit together'.  And the ruling parties in Greece say ok, and start getting their shit together.  But its not easy; Greeks have had the government holding their hand for the past 30 years.  People are set in their ways; they don't want to give up what by now the most certainly take for granted.  Add into this the idea that it wasn't the laziness and corruption of the general population that led to this but rather it was politicians who screwed it up, and the people don't feel like they have any responsibility in this.  They see no reason they should have to change.  It wasn't their fault, by their logic.    A smart politician sees this undercurrent of discontent, and harnesses it to rise to power. (cough cough Tsipiras)  He tells Greeks it was someone else who caused this, not us, and we love it.  After all who like taking blame."

worldevents,307nsl,corathus59,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"From the article --  ' It is Merkel, too, who oversees efforts to negotiate an end to the devastating war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels who have carved out an enclave in the east of the country bordering Russia. “She’s the only person [Russian President] Vladimir Putin takes really seriously. It’s not [U.S. President Barack] Obama. It’s no one else from the European Union. It’s Merkel who really matters to him as a powerful person in this conflict,” says Stefan Meister, an Eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, who advises the German chancellor and foreign ministry.  ' ...  ' Domestically, Merkel is unassailable. Polls put her approval rating around 70 per cent. She leads a “grand coalition” that combines her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) as a junior partner. Together, they hold more than 500 out of 631 seats in the German parliament, or Bundestag.  ' ...  ' ... Merkel has governed Germany and, increasingly, Europe, with the same pragmatic approach that won her victory in those Russian competitions. She recognizes what must be done and does it, whether it comes naturally to her or not. ...  ' Merkel was never hungry for the trappings of power: the wealth, the prestige and the deference. She doesn’t need adoration. She lives modestly and doesn’t look down on her colleagues in Europe, nor fellow citizens in Germany. And yet—and in part because of those qualities—she’s emerged as the one figure uniquely suited to deal with two of the biggest crises facing the West today.  ' ...  ' Exactly why Merkel chose to pursue politics is not clear, but her career took off once the wall fell. She joined the new Democratic Awakening party, which then merged with the East German Christian Democratic Union and, finally, with its West German counterpart following reunification. Merkel, at age 36, contested the first post-reunification federal election in 1990 and entered the Bundestag as a CDU member. She was quickly appointed to chancellor Helmut Kohl’s cabinet and remained one of his protégées until his defeat in the 1998 federal election.  ' When Kohl was implicated in a party-donations scandal, Merkel, whom Kohl had often patronizingly called “my girl,” showed strategic ruthlessness. She publicly criticized Kohl and advocated a new start for the party. She was elected CDU leader in 2000, paving the way for a failed run at the chancellorship in 2002, followed by a successful one in 2005.  ' ...  ' The personal lives of Merkel and Putin in many ways reflect the intertwined histories of their two countries. While Merkel studied Russian language and culture during the Cold War, Putin studied German. He was working for the KGB and was stationed in Dresden when the wall came down.  ' The two can converse in both Russian and German, and do so regularly. Last September, the Kremlin reported Putin had spoken with Merkel 35 times so far that year—more than three times the number of phone conversations he had had with Obama. “She has a deep understanding of the Russian mentality, the Russian language. I think she understands him,” says Thomas Stritzl, a CDU Bundestag member.  ' ...  ' [But the sheen of mutual respect and perhaps trust is] all gone now, because of Russian aggression in Ukraine, and Putin’s denials about it. “She was very disappointed that he lied to her several times, on some agreements, on the question of how Russia supports the separatists,” says Stefan Liebich, a Bundestag member and foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition, the Left party. Today, the senior official close to Merkel describes the chancellor’s relationship with Putin as one that is without illusions.  ' Yet Merkel never scaled back her diplomatic efforts with Putin, even as she must have felt the personal insult of betrayal. Indeed, she flew to Moscow in an effort to prepare the ground for a deal at a time when there was no guarantee she would be successful. Taking this sort of risk is uncharacteristic for Merkel, and it’s not obvious why she did it. Asked what motivates his boss, Peter Tauber, general secretary of the CDU, says, “peace.”  ' There may be some truth to that, but Merkel is not a reflexive pacifist. She has, with broad parliamentary support, kept German troops in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led training and advisory mission. Germany’s deployment was recently extended for another year.  ' What’s driving Merkel’s diplomacy on Ukraine may not be so much a desire for peace as fear of a much larger and bloodier war on Europe’s doorstep.  ' ...  ' ... There’s never been a whiff of corruption or scandal surrounding Merkel. ...  ' ...  ' In Merkel, Germans see traits they want to believe are their own: thrift, modesty, rationality, a willingness to work hard.   ' ...  ' That Merkel doesn’t project a sense of grandeur makes Germans more comfortable with their chancellor playing a bigger role internationally, including regarding the euro crisis. Outside Germany, it may also take some of the sting out of Germany dominating Europe again.  ...  ' ...  ' ... after three election victories and nearly a decade in office, Merkel’s chancellorship has acquired its own sizable weight and impact. She has governed longer than most of her peers in the world—with a notable exception in President Putin of Russia. Her accomplishments are less obviously demonstrative than those of some who came before her. '"
worldevents,304fj4,workerbotsuperhero,21,Tue Mar 24 11:58:59 2015 UTC,"Americans, the people who built six transcontinental railroads, Grand Coulee and Hoover dams and the Interstate Highway System among so much else, have lost their way.    We have. The article also mentions the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, which was huge for engineering history and technology. That was 145 years ago. Where is today's big, inspiring project?   Some politicians are opposed to rail projects on ideological grounds, even though they are more necessary than ever to address congestion and the automobile emissions that are helping cause climate change.   This. This right here. Cars, highways, suburban sprawl, and oil are doing nothing but chaining us to a built environment, an entire way of life, that is probably highly unsustainable. And doing a lot to jeopardize our future. Not to mention also contributing to epidemic health problems, and a lot of our social problems.   If you compare the US to most developed nations, our infrastructure and transportation system makes us look more like a developing country. Just ride a high speed train in Europe or Japan, and then come back here and drive down a congested highway for 4 hours to get to the next major city. We could do a lot better, if our priorities were smarter."
worldevents,304fj4,FreakySpook,4,Tue Mar 24 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"Australian here, don't worry our successive state and federal governments are all doing the same thing. The last 30 years our governments have only spent big on freeways and focused entirely on privatising any other infrastructure. Apparently modern government's can't build things, only private companies can.  The last big infrastructure project was our previous governments NBN which was to deploy fibre to over 90% of premises in Australia to create one network, but the new government changed the project to lease back the copper network from the monopoly operator it privatised 13 years ago who ran it into the ground."
worldevents,304fj4,OneSalientOversight,4,Tue Mar 24 20:34:56 2015 UTC,"Apparently modern government's can't build things, only private companies can.   This is neoliberalism, as well as conservatism. Only the market can do things. The government can't because only the profit motive creates an efficient allocation of economic resources.  But of course this is an ideology that has some truth to it. Mankind's progress since the agricultural revolution a few millennia ago has been linked to individual actors providing goods and services to those who need it.  The problem is that Government has been around for at least as long as private industry has, and is capable of emulating the free market in both its ability to efficiently determine the allocation of certain economic resources and its ability to stuff things up in ginormous fashion.  Infrastructure is one good example of the problem of the free market - they just aren't motivated to spend the money on it because the free market needs a direct profit motive to work. Creating, say, a massive underground rail network around Sydney that quadruples the amounts of rail stations would end up benefiting everyone who lives in Sydney but not necessarily the owners and operators of the lines and trains themselves. This is because profit, like cost, can exceed the boundaries of the two actors involved in a point of sale.  And because profit can be made indirectly, rather than directly by the maker/seller, the entity best suited to create these particular goods or services must be one which has a broad stake in the good of the community economy as a whole... namely government.  An example of this would be, say, the polio vaccine. Developed during the 50s (I think), the cost of research and production and administration of such a vaccine resulted in the healthy economic lives of people who would've once been dead or at least unable to work due to their disability. The economic activity by these people boosted the entire economy in turn, which meant that the economy as a whole benefited from the vaccine, while the researchers and makers saw very little of that benefit. The vaccine was then used overseas, allowing the economies and societies of multiple countries to be boosted and bettered. Again the original researchers and makers saw little of this financial gain, but the gain would not have been so great had the vaccine remained completely in private hands."

The whole shit-storm may have started off as a popular anti-authoritarian uprising, but that's clearly not what it is now. It's a sadly familiar narrative which people are just tired of hearing. Target audiences are worn out and are indifferent because these stories have become a given.  There's so many unimaginable, horrific atrocities happening there that all but the grizzliest and gruesome acts are considered newsworthy, and even then, it's just for the shock value.  Other than that, this is just another conflict in which Muslim brown people are blowing themselves up, decapitating each other, enslaving each other's women and children, and otherwise running wild in an unending tide of despoliation.   People care little because they know that unlike natural disaster relief (where assistance, public support and outreach are generally straightforward, unanimous and easily rendered into tangible efforts - where a real difference can be made), Syria is a situation in which there will be no winners, aside from probably that of the groups like ISIL, who don't even follow the law of nature and will piss on pretty much any outcome or effort, however nobly intended.  The West can't do anything to help; it's politically divisive, politically expensive and there's no perceptible payoff. The whole god-damned region really needs to either sort its own shit out, or stop complaining about Western intervention and indifference."

That seems somewhat unfair, given the history of colonization, occupation, political interference, and the creation of a network of arguably highly artificial states by Western powers.   Look at much of Africa. Many of the countries there were created by British and French leaders drawing arbitrary lines on maps.

worldevents,2zi562,lucidfucker,2,Thu Mar 19 13:11:52 2015 UTC,"Point taken; the Colonial era created a lot of problems.  But people forget that Europe (from the post-Roman Dark Ages all the way through to the end of WW2), a far younger collection of civilisations compared to Mesopotamia was, for over a thousand years, itself once an extended and continuous hotbed of natural disasters, vicious religious wars, ethnic conflict, territorial wars and succession disputes - all of which involved invasion, occupation, colonisation, and an institutionalised use of military tactics on civilian populations that would be described in modern times as heinous and horrific war crimes.  In my opinion, a lot of the Middle East needs to completely collapse under the weight of its own seething arbitrary tribal and religious divisions so that they can figure out for themselves how to conduct a sustainable, plural and non-destructive civil society. The conflict on the ground in Syria and Iraq is almost medieval/feudal, only the participants have 21st century weapons.  Any foreign intervention at this point is just palliative and prolonging the situation without actually addressing the deeper root causes. You can stop people from killing each other, temporarily, but you haven't stopped them from wanting to do so."

Plus, we have plenty of prior evidence as to how Putin deals with enemies; killing them is rather out of character for him.    Besides, the opposition in Russia is hardly what the US makes it out to be.  Putin's party, United Russia has a 53% majority in the Duma.  The next largest party is the communist party , which has a 20% share.  They have been quite critical of Putin- for not being more aggressive in Ukraine.  Hardly the left we seem to envision.  The next largest party is A Just Russia, a leftist party, with about 15% of the vote.  They are in a coalition with United Russia, and have not been criticizing Putin.  The remaining party is the Political Party LDPR, with 12%.  Finally, an opposition party that criticizes Putin!  Only they are right wing Russian nationalists, and want to revive the Russian empire for themselves.  Hmm.  So what about Nemetsov's party, a liberal pro-west party?  They do not occupy a single seat in the national legislature, only some regional seats.  Their party registration, as of 2011, was about 50,000.  In a country of about 150 million.  3 hundredths of a percent.    Why is this reality not reflected at all by western media?  I suspect the answer may be similar to that of the question 'why does Russia think the US is hell bent on destroying them?'  Well, the media has always painted our foes as less capable and more evil than they actually are.  I do believe its called propaganda.

Economically, oil is important, but Sweden's neighbor is the friendly oil-rich state of Norway. Oil is not an issue for Sweden. As far as arms sales go, that $39 million arms sale represents just 0.008% of Sweden's GDP. It's hardly much of a loss. Economically Sweden is hardly dependent on Saudi Arabia, which isn't true for most western countries.  Saudi Arabia is not a nice country.

Losing clarity on what is actually national security prevents us from acting quickly when those human rights abuses occur.    If Congress wants to sanction or declare war on some country, they should do so without needing a lie as pretext.  One way to take action would be to look at whatever law requires a ""national security"" declaration (citation needed), and change that to ""US national security or international human rights"".

These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend ""each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary"" back in 2013.   This paragraph is the most important. Something like 90% of Egypts population lives along the Nile. While hydroelectric is great for clean energy, its hell on rivers. Not only does the dam plug up the river and reduce its overall flowrate, but the lakes and reservoirs formed by the dams radically increase the evaporation of the water. All that total sup to a lot less water available to people downstream. Thats bad for the Egyptians, who otherwise live in a desert, and the Sudanese who use the water for farming (also extremely wasteful).   The Egyptians have had a history of being bellicose over any damning the Nile River, and even the British way back in the 19th century feared one of their enemies damming the river and depopulating Egypt.

' ... Mrs Merkel believes it is always better to keep talking than to stoke conflict. She was seven when the Berlin Wall was built, she told a security conference in Munich this month, glancing at American legislators who were urging her to arm Ukraine. The West did not react to the wall with escalation, but held firm for 28 years until it prevailed: that was the only way forward now, she suggested.  ' For all the new activism, German foreign policy still has distinctive features, mostly legacies of a culture of atonement. The first is insistence that Germany must never be isolated; it must act with partners and institutions. ...  ' ...   ' Another hallmark of German style is wariness of one basic tool of foreign policy: armed force. True, Germany does its bit for NATO and sent troops to Kosovo and Afghanistan; but those forces were mainly in a support role and tried to avoid firefights. It is now actively helping NATO’s efforts to react faster in eastern Europe. ... But outside its collaborative role in NATO, Germany still hews closely to its post-war pacifism. ...  ' ...  ' ... Does Germany have [a strategy]?  It certainly has a wish-list. One is to prevent crises surging into full-fledged war. ...  ' Another desire is moral clarity. This reflects the country’s trauma over its past, says Jan Techau of Carnegie Europe, a think-tank.

worldevents,2xv456,TheGhostOfTzvika,3,Wed Mar 4 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"From the article --  ' ... new measures in the countryside appear to sanction people farming for the market rather than for the state. It represents a tacit abandonment of state collectives in favour of family farming, and seems already to have had an effect. For the first time in decades, North Korea grew nearly enough to feed itself last year. Thanks to better harvests, the North Korean economy could grow by 7.5% this year, compared with annual growth of little more than 1% for a decade, reckons the Hyundai Research Institute, a think-tank in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Asia’s basket case could prove to be its fastest-growing economy.  ' Caveats abound. North Korea divulges little useful data, and last year the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) was not allowed in to conduct field checks. Many homes still have too little to eat—North Koreans on average consume a little over half the number of calories of their rich brethren in South Korea (for other comparisons, see chart). Still, anecdotal evidence suggests that change in this benighted country is under way.     ' The agricultural experiment seems to have been devised in secret after Kim Jong Un came to power just over three years ago following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. It was set in motion from 2013. Initially, it allowed groups of about a dozen labourers to register as agricultural work teams, effectively reorganising the big socialist collectives that have been a feature of North Korean agriculture since the 1950s. Farmers were also allowed to retain 30% of a new quota on production—a much bigger share than before. In addition, they could keep (ie, sell on the market) any excess harvest above the quota. Previously any surplus would have gone to the state.  ' Under a plan referred to as the May 30th measures, those teams were shrunk again last year, to the size of a typical family, while their share of the quota was enlarged to 60%. Even the permitted size of families’ kitchen gardens, which are far more productive patches than land tilled for the state, have been expanded dramatically, from 100 square metres to 3,300 square metres. For Andrei Lankov, a longtime watcher of North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul, the new measures, a quasi-privatisation of state land, are nothing short of revolutionary.  ' A second area of experimentation, in state industry, is equally striking. Under the May measures, state factory managers may appoint their own employees, set workers’ salaries, buy raw materials on the market and sell part of their production there too. Like farmers, managers will need to pay their dues to the state. Yet, says Mr Lankov, that is not so different from paying corporate taxes in a capitalist economy.  ' The regime is also promoting special economic zones (SEZs) with gusto, thanks to a new law on them. Andray Abrahamian of Choson Exchange, a non-profit group that organises business workshops in North Korea, describes a “palpable energy and excitement” among officials in charge of SEZs.  ' ...  ' ... the regime may not be leading change so much as responding to it. ... Today, three-quarters of what most people earn probably comes from an unregulated private economy. '"

This is the heart of the matter. If relations between the US and Iran ever normalized, Israel's importance in US foreign policy would diminish. Since Israel's abusive policies regarding the Palestinians have alienated most other major powers, Israeli foreign policy depends on guaranteed American support. Without that, they would have to be much more conciliatory, and probably have to allow the formation of a Palestinian state."

worldevents,2x4yog,BadgerRush,-9,Thu Feb 26 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"So ""the outbreak"" includes how many countries?  This seems very arbitrary to me and not exactly scientific.   And for the record, the vast majority of ""the third world"" have considerably better vaccination rates than West Europe (and the USA).   I doubt that very much.  As UNICEF says in their report, ""more must be done to target the 24 million children, mainly in developing countries, who are proving difficult to reach with vaccines.""   Myths such as the one you have fallen for are pretty typical of the current media hysteria over measles and vaccine-free children.  They love to lay out figures about how low the vaccination rates are in schools, but fail to mention that the reason the numbers are so low is because the immunization doesn't last very long.  If that was more widely known people might start to ask if vaccines really work, and we can't have that now can we?  Not if they want to sustain the trend noted in the same report:   Since the year 2000, the global vaccine market has almost tripled – reaching over US$ 17 billion in global revenue by mid-2008, and making the vaccine industry one of the fastest growing sectors of industry. Most of this expansion comes from sales in industrialized countries of newer, more costly vaccines, which account for more than half of the total value of vaccine sales worldwide."

There isn't enough data? isn't enough data!? There are entire fields and sub-fields dedicated to it. It has been studied for nigh 100 years. There are reams of data. Thousands of studies, probably tens of thousands. Exactly how much data are you looking for? What specific experiment would convince you that isn't horribly unethical? Name it, and I bet you it's been done 10 times over.  That link is worth a laugh or ten as well. It starts off reasonably by saying perhaps vaccinating the violently ill is a bad idea then veers off into left field like a drunken farmer. I'm afraid that Nephrologist has made the classic mistake of thinking that because they're a doctor (of kidneys) they understand how science works. They are wrong, at least if that page is anything to go by. That or they're just trying to sell a book. You don't disprove vaccinations by doing random correlative graphs of every town in history until you find one where the squiggle fits your story. You disprove them by vaccinating half a town and seeing which half dies quicker.  In one paragraph it says that Polio was never eradicated in the US and in the next that polio only comes from other countries. The ""proof"" it gives is the weakest most circumstantial stuff you can find. I could find equally strong evidence against a dozen true things because reality happens to have random variables.  Look, I'm sorry but that's just not how you go about finding the truth about things. If you want to prove whether vaccines work, you vaccinate some people and not others. Then you see who catches the disease most. According to this person they should get sick equally often. Show me that happening in a preponderance of all studies and I shall be instantly convinced. Problem is, you can't, because when they did that they found the opposite thing, that it reduced rates of infection by >90% in the vaccinated half."

There is plenty of data, the question is whether we have the right data or not.  For instance, we may have tons of data showing such-and-such vaccine results in antibody levels among the recipients.  But that is not telling us the whole story of immunity and yes I think that there is still a lot to learn about the immune system (and every other system in the body).  We are at the infancy of this science and we can't just assume that we have all the answers as the vaccine manufacturers like to claim.   You don't disprove vaccinations by doing random correlative graphs of every town in history until you find one where the squiggle fits your story. You disprove them by vaccinating half a town and seeing which half dies quicker.   Would you not consider that unethical?  If not, then I don't see that we disagree.

I don't think I'd call studies into immunity to be in their infancy, either. We've been working hard at it for almost a century now. Sports science is in it's infancy, they've been working on than for only a decade or two.  The way to get around it ethically is you offer the vaccine to everyone, and then some of them don't bother to show up or refuse to vaccinate. Then you track what happens to both populations. I'm not really sure why it being double blind is important though in this particular case. That only matters when subjective symptoms are being reported, not so much when counting mortality rates or when you can just do a culture to see if it's the right virus. All the same, ask and I shall answer:  Mortality for the 5274 children aged 0-6 months was lower in the group vaccinated with any vaccine compared with those not vaccinated, the mortality ratio being 0.74. There's a lovely graph below table 3 that shows the mortality rates of vaccinated vs vaccinated babies. Looks like it saves... 20 out of every 1000, cutting infant mortality by between 1/2 and 1/3rd at 6 months."
worldevents,2x4yog,macsenscam,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"Did I say we should throw our research out the window?  No, I'm just saying that we need to do more.  Maybe our research into the immune system isn't in ""infancy,"" maybe it's a toddler.  Anyhow, just reading the study you posted is enough to show that there are a lot more questions than there are answers.  For example:  ""Measles vaccine is strongly associated with better childhood survival in developing countries. 1 2 Since this effect cannot be explained by the specific prevention of measles, 1 3 4 standard measles vaccine may be associated with a non-specific beneficial activation of the immune system.""  So basically the measles vaccine gives good numbers, but they have no clue why.  This is why there is a need for a double-blind control study, to eliminate other factors so we can find out what the numbers mean.    Further: ""recipients of one dose of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis or polio vaccines had higher mortality than children who had received none of these vaccines .""  To me this means that we need to do more research and indeed the study concludes that as well:   ""Research on vaccines in developing countries recommended by the World Health Organization has emphasised serological responses and protection against specific diseases.1 The aim of the research has been to optimise vaccine schedules for control, elimination, or eradication of disease. In modelling exercises, vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio has been assumed to save 1.5-2.0% of the children in areas with high infant mortality.15 However, these assumptions are not supported by data, and few studies of the effect of routine vaccinations other than measles on mortality have been carried out in developing countries.""  So basically they are saying that the measles vaccine appears to be helpful (although no one knows why because the kids that weren't vaccinated aren't dying from measles), but other than that there has been pretty much no research done.  Thanks for proving my point for me!"
worldevents,2x4yog,FuguofAnotherWorld,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"There will never be a time when we do not need to do more research. We know, right now that the stuff improves infant mortality by 2%. The exact mechanism it does that, is a huge amount less important than carting the stuff out there to save those specific lives.   Your point was this ""As far as vaccine efficacy goes, I think there isn't enough data personally"". I have just given you data on vaccine efficacy, that shows that vaccines are effective. If that somehow proved your point then you must have invented a new one to move the goal posts while I wasn't looking.  You keep calling for a double-blind control study. I don't think you understand what it is. If you did, you would understand that it's irrelevant and horribly unethical in this case. Double blind control studies are not some mystic science ritual that spits out answers, it just means that neither the experimenter nor the patient actually knows whether a vaccine given to each person is real or not. You would have to give people fake vaccines and pretend that they were real. We are looking at mortality rates. Unless you are implying these people would choose whether or not to drop dead depending on if they knew the vaccine was real, a double blind study would do nothing."

I think it was Carl Sagan on the post-""The Day After"" movie panel on ABC who said that if the Soviet Union fired all its missiles, he hoped the west would have the humanity to not fire theirs back. And just as soon as he said that some of the foreign policy experts starting saying ""no no no shut up up don't say that of course we need to fire back! hey soviets we'll fire back don't listen to this guy!""

I think it was Carl Sagan on the post   The most disturbing part about nuclear war, is that the guys who plan for it really belive in what they are doing. That is to say, they fully intended to push the button if the Soviets made their launches. And then you get presidents like Reagan, who advocated hitting first, to make sure a Soviet counter-attack wouldnt destroy the US. Without an effective ABM defense, the only way to stop a Soviet attack on the US was to hit their missiles while they were still on the ground. If anything, that made the threat of a full scale nuclear war even more likely, especially when you realize that any Soviet offensive in Europe would be presaged by a massive strike against Bonn, Brussels, Paris, Antwerp, and Rammstein. A little tactical exchange might make sense to the Soviets, who generally relied on larger theater range missiles, but I could not envision a scenario in which a major European capital was nuked and the United States didnt respond in kind. But then you have to consider the road to escalation, what would the Soviets do if the US hit Prague and Warsaw? Better to devastate the Soviets in one massive early strike than to risk an escalation which allowed the Soviets to strike first. And of course the Soviets were thinking along the same lines.  Once you really look at nuclear war, you realize that it was designed to be completely unethical. And the planners realized this, and thus didnt really think about the ""humanity"" of the situation, or what would be the best outcome. They planned to win, whatever that meant.

So of course there's this new weapon on the block every kid is going to need to stock up.

This is the period when deterrent evolved from World War Two style bombing raids with a mix of conventional and nuclear bombs, towards the strategic nuclear triangle of ICBMs, Bombers, and Submarine Launched BMs. And from an early point, planners understood that large military bases and ""industrial"" facilities were the best targets for the inaccurate but massively destructive fission and fusion bombs.

Missile defense actually encourages a first-strike since it doesn't do much against a first strike assault but could help a lot if a good deal of Russia's missiles can be taken out in the first strike."

worldevents,2wmajc,NonZionist,2,Mon Feb 23 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"If the ""threats"" are ""secret"", then how am I supposed to know about them?!  I am limited to what I can read on the Internet.  I compare what I read with my own experience and come to my own conclusions.  Here is an excerpt from the first article I come to when I use Google to search for ""Vaca Muerta secret threats""   “There are no secret clauses, and only points of confidentiality” in the agreement between YPF and the Chevron corporation in Vaca Muerta, said Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich, who denied reports published by the newspapers La Nación and Clarín.  During his press round, the Cabinet Chief held that “everything that is on contract is what is normal on matters of transactions with multinational corporations.”  He attributed both Clarín and La Nación’s news to “the permanent press operations conducted by media concentrated groups that never get tired of trying to blackmail the Government.”   -- ""Capitanich denied “secret clauses” on Vaca Muerta YPF-Chevron agreement"", telam, 23 Feb 2015  I tend to distrust government, but I have an even lower opinion of the Establishment media, so tentatively I will side with Capitanich.  I favor the multipolar world of the BRICS to the unipolar world of the U.S. Empire.  I see this war-addicted Empire as an existential threat to the human race.  Kirchner seems to side with the BRICS, so I, in turn, side with her government.  ❧   the bomb that was activated by zionist, is a ridiculous theory from argentinian neonazis like Alejandro Biondini.   I will let the ""neonazis"" at the London Sunday Times answer in my behalf:   It reached its most intense point in July 1946, when the British headquarters at the King David hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by Jewish fighters dressed as Arabs with explosives contained in milk churns. Ninety-one people, 28 of them British, were killed.   -- ""Jewish plot to kill Bevin in London"", The Sunday Times, 05 Mar 2006  And 19 of the victims were Jews.  From this and many other examples, we conclude that the Zionists regard all human beings as expendable -- and ""all"" includes Jews.  Peaceable dovish non-Zionist Jews are especially expendable.  It is dishonest to suggest that ""argentinian neonazis like Alejandro Biondini"" are the only people who know about the Zionist involvement in terror and assassination.  ❧   Adrian Salbuchi thinks that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a true book about jewish world domination   I would rather let Salbuchi speak for himself than hear words that someone else puts in his mouth.    I notice that Zionists frequently use ad hominem attacks when they cannot argue with what a person has actually written.  The attacks are used to discredit and, in effect, censor people who have intelligent things to say that Zionists do not want us to hear.  A decade ago, I read a few passages from The Protocols.  As I recall, ""Jews"" were nowhere mentioned.  The book, as I dimly recall, explains how a cabal of rich and powerful individuals, using absolutely sinister methods, can come to dominate the world.  The book reminded me of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four and Machiavelli's The Prince.  Both are works of fiction, but both make true statements about our society."

worldevents,2w9rqa,TheGhostOfTzvika,3,Wed Feb 18 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"From the article --  ' Venezuela is suffering from the combination of years of mismanagement and corruption, and the collapse in the price of oil, which accounts for almost all of its exports. Chávez, an army officer, was the beneficiary of the greatest oil boom in history. From 2000 to 2012, Venezuela received around $800 billion in oil revenue, or two-and-a-half times as much in real terms as in the previous 13 years. He spent the money on “21st-century socialism”.  ' Some went on health care and low-cost housing for the poor, who hailed Chávez as a secular saint. Some has gone on infrastructure: a few new roads and metro lines were built, years behind schedule. Another chunk was given away in the form of cheap oil to Cuba and to other Caribbean countries, assuring Chávez loyal allies. Perhaps the biggest slice was frittered away or simply stolen. Filling a 60-litre tank with petrol costs less than a dollar at the strongest official exchange rate. Unsurprisingly, petrol worth $2.2 billion a year, according to an official estimate, is smuggled to Colombia and Brazil, with the complicity of the armed forces.  ' As well as rewarding supporters with state jobs (the public payroll has more than doubled in 16 years), Chávez expropriated or nationalised 1,200 companies, from steelworks to a maker of cleaning products. Most now lose money and require government loans just to meet their payroll, according to Víctor Álvarez, Chávez’s industry minister in 2005-06. The state subjugates the still-large private sector through price controls, which discourage investment and production. The result is that Venezuela imports much of the food and consumer goods it used to produce, though not enough to meet demand.  ' Under Mr Maduro the controls have become more draconian. Blaming retailers for the queues outside their shops, this month the government arrested the bosses of a big pharmacy chain and a supermarket company, both of which it has commandeered. ...  ' ...  ' The authoritarian state he commands is sliding towards totalitarianism. On January 27th the defence minister issued an unconstitutional decree allowing the armed forces to use their weapons against protests if these turn violent. Cuban intelligence agents police the armed forces and the ministries, alert for any sign of dissent. Chávez seized control of the judiciary and all the other constitutionally independent branches of the state. A group of lawyers studied more than 45,000 rulings issued in 2004-13 by the constitutional, administrative and electoral chambers of the supreme court and found that in no case did they rule against the government.  ' Under Mr Maduro, what the government calls its “media hegemony” is now all but complete. Regime insiders, acting through front men, have bought up opposition media after these were financially weakened by officially promoted advertising boycotts and government refusal to approve the import of newsprint. ...  ' ...  ' ... Mr Maduro himself draws a parallel between his government and that of Chile’s Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist toppled by General Pinochet’s CIA-supported coup in 1973.  ' The parallel is a false one. Allende may have governed badly, but he governed democratically, unlike Chávez or Mr Maduro. It is Venezuela’s opposition who are the democrats, unlike some of those who plotted against Allende. And the United States, apart from a recent congressional initiative to impose sanctions on officials identified as having committed abuses during last year’s protests, has kept well away from Venezuela. A survey by Datanálisis, a polling company, finds that only 22% of respondents still believe the government’s argument that it is the victim of an “economic war”. '"

Russia, by contrast, “has always been a state civilisation held together by the Russian people, the Russian language, Russian culture and the Russian Orthodox church.” The Donbas rebels are fighting not only the Ukrainian army, but against a corrupt Western way of life in order to defend Russia’s distinct world view.  ' ...  ' At home Russian media, which are mostly state-controlled, churn out lies and conspiracy theories. Abroad, the main conduit for the Kremlin’s world view is RT, a TV channel set up in 2005 to promote a positive view of Russia that now focuses on making the West look bad. It uses Western voices: far-left anti-globalists, far-right nationalists and disillusioned individuals. It broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and is planning German- and French-language channels. It claims to reach 700m people worldwide and 2.7m hotel rooms. Though it is not a complete farce, it has broadcast a string of false stories, such as one speculating that America was behind the Ebola epidemic in west Africa.  ' ...  ' Far-right groups are seduced by the idea of Moscow as a counterweight to the EU, and by its law-and-order policies. Its stance on homosexuality and promotion of “traditional” moral values appeal to religious conservatives. The far left likes the talk of fighting American hegemony. '"

It's very silly to attempt to make a manichean narrative of what is happening in the Ukraine.   At home Russian media, which are mostly state-controlled, churn out lies and conspiracy theories.   There is Dozhd', there is Ekho Moskvy, there is the Russian BBC service, there is Radio Liberty if you're in the mood for a Glenn Beck. If Kremlin media had as much influence Putin wouldn't have to commit electoral fraud.   I don't like when NATO patriotism gets so hard they start picturing the Russians themselves as mindless armies of slaves who can as well get nuked for their best.   Amongst the liberals, amongst those who agree that Putin has to go, the opinions on the Ukraine are evenly split. Even Strelkov, the former leader of the rebels, has previously been an anti-Putinist. He was replaced early on as a sign of goodwill towards the Russian Federation.   Though it is not a complete farce, it has broadcast a string of false stories, such as one speculating that America was behind the Ebola epidemic in west Africa.   Yes. It was a personal project of Margarita Simonyan. She is a laughing stock in the domestic public as but the kremlin seems to be glad with her work. They have more able and mature editors at disposal but what they want is a exactly FOXNews/CNN channel on LSD instead of something for the middle class. Simonyan herself claimed in an interview on Echo Moskvy (it's like Glenn Beck doing an interview for MSNBC) it's because the intellectuals Americans can think for themselves.

A new Atlantic Council report, written by eight former officials, proposes $3 billion of military supplies over the next three years, including anti-tank missiles. “Only if the Kremlin knows that the risks and costs of further military action are high will it seek to find an acceptable political solution,” the report argues. Barack Obama has resisted calls for military aid; Ashton Carter, his nominee as defence secretary, is in favour (see article). John Kerry, the secretary of state, flew to Kiev this week for peace talks. On February 5th Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s François Hollande announced that they too would go to Kiev and then to Moscow.  ' Opponents of military aid, including Germany, warn of a proxy war with Russia that the West cannot win. No NATO country is ready to send in troops, and Ukraine’s forces are underequipped, undertrained and poorly led. The suggested weapons are “needed, but will not be a game-changer,” argues Konrad Muzyka, a defence analyst at IHS Jane’s. Sending weapons could provoke a Russian response and play into Mr Putin’s claims that Ukraine’s army is a NATO foreign legion. Russia would just send more equipment to the rebels, says Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. If Mr Putin called in the full force of the Russian army, no amount of arms would save Ukraine, as even the most hawkish would admit. '"

The german left is (and actually the majority of the population), in general, against wars and thus has been pretty strongly against the american incursions to Afghanistan and Iraq. Also plenty of people are looking critically at the entire ukraine situation because it is a major clusterfuck down there and ""the west"" is not really helping in the situation. It's clear that russia is at least partially at fault and media does cover russia negatively, but it doesn't jump the gun and declares everything that happens down there russias fault (hence why the rebels are called separatists and not terrorists or russian troops or whatnot)  But saying germany is anti-american is a joke. I would say that germany is one of the biggest ""americanized"" countries in western europe. American culture, whether it's music, entertainment or general lifestyle is a lot bigger in germany then, let's say, france. A lot more people speak english than in plenty other countries.  Saying that 1000 people went to a ""demo"" is nothing. Germans love to go on the street for whatever cause. The entire ""Pegida"" (patriotic europeans against the islamisation of the west) thing, which this spun off of, had tens of thousands coming in the past months.  also some other stuff of the article:   it has leapt beyond the CSU’s beer tents to a young ultraconservative party,   So the CSU is a beer tent party, good to know. (the CSU is the third biggest germany party, even though it only exists in 1 out of 16 states)   Such mistrust now threatens the transatlantic free-trade deal. Most EU citizens back it. But support is lowest (at only 39%) in Germany and Austria, says one recent poll.   Oh come on. So the pretty complex and complicated subject of the trade deal, that would see a lot of german licensing go to shreds (things like ""black forest ham"" is protected in germany and can only come from the region, a thing the trade deal would remove), is reduced down to some loonies being against america?"

In doing so, Bibi had not only disrespected the current occupant of the White House, whose aides have called Bibi a “chickenshit,” but much more seriously—the institution of the Presidency itself.  ' ...  ' Only, now it turns out that—according to the Times—the story wasn’t true at all. In fact, Netanyahu had informed the White House of his visit before announcing it to anyone—a minor detail which means that the paper’s original reporting and all the huffing, puffing outrage that followed was dead wrong. And if Bibi had followed standard protocol, and given the White House the diplomatically-appropriate heads-up, as the Times‘ correction clearly and unequivocably stated, that meant that the Times‘ White House sources had been woefully and entirely misinformed about a key matter of protocol—or, more likely, had invented the tale of Bibi’s outrageous behavior out of whole cloth in order to blunt his unwelcome criticisms of the Administration’s Iran policy.  ' The decent thing to do would’ve been to write another piece altogether, contemplate why the paper of record got suckered so badly by the White House—which gained plenty from the manufactured story—and amend any and all implications of Bibi’s perfidy and bad manners that arose from the original report.  ' But hey, it’s only Bibi, a man whose villainy is so inherently assumed by the Times’ writers and readers alike that correcting the record with anything more than a footnote is hardly worth the trouble. There’s no reason to spoil The Narrative, the great story of a benighted Israel governed by hard and bad men and growing increasingly intransigent and soulless and mean—as evidenced by their opposition to Obama’s attempts to reach a mutually-beneficial nuclear deal with Iran. When it comes to Israel, it’s the only story the Times knows how to tell, even when the facts get in the way. For that, we’ll always have The Correction.

worldevents,2v43xv,macsenscam,1 point,Sun Feb 8 16:40:14 2015 UTC,There would be far fewer outbreaks of diseases like this if all that can be immunized would get immunized. We leave it up to the individual to see a doctor and get the vaccines. Some can't be immunized because of other factors like low immune systems and babies can't be immunized for the first 6 months. All the rest of the population can be immunized.  Immunized protection falls off over the years so older people that were immunized can still get these diseases though not as easily as the un-immunized. The real question tells us the the percentage of the population that is actively putting the rest of society at risk for diseases that we have preventions for. When this number gets high enough the government needs to step up and force them to get immunized or be locked up to protect the rest of us. The un-immunized are a severe hazard to the rest of society and their indifference cannot continue to be ignored as population density increases.
worldevents,2v43xv,meangrampa,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Some can't be immunized because of other factors like low immune systems and babies can't be immunized for the first 6 months.   Maybe you aren't talking about the US, but in this country both of those sectors of the population can and are immunized without any concern whatever.  This is why I am against mandatory vaccination, they don't give a crap about any actual existing medical conditions (such as being an infant, having autism in your family, or being very sick), they just want to immunize you as a matter of course even if it kills or maims you.  Giving a medical establishment like that the power to inject you with whatever they decide you should be injected with at will is just madness.  Quarantine I understand, but forced preventative medical procedures (or any invasive medical procedure against the patient's will) is unquestionably not something I want to be allowed.  History has shown too many times that that power will be abused.     Also, it should be noted that vaccination is the one medical procedure (in the US) that you are not allowed to sue for damages over if they harm you.  In any rational consideration of the risks, you are clearly at more risk of harm if those potentially harming you are without any fear of consequences for what they do.  Hell, I wouldn't even eat at McDonald's if I knew they were protected from all lawsuits by the federal government!  This principle is acknowledged in every single other case under US law, except vaccines.  Sure, protecting against disease outbreaks is important, but I still think you have to be a little naive to just give up one of the founding principles of our society because you are afraid of getting measles.  I mean, people used to get measles as a matter of course, they even brought their kids to specifically hang-out with infected kids to make sure they got it (if you get it young it's much less dangerous, like the chine-pox).  Now we are ready to give up the rights we have over our own bodies to avoid this ""plague?""  It all seems a bit hysterical to me."

That's not how it works. First officers and captains are held to exactly the same standards as far as flying ability is concerned. And, believe it or not, but the difference in stick-and-rudder flying ability between a 4000 hour first officer and a 20000 hour captain isn't all that significant, assuming such a difference even exists. The difference between being a captain and a first officer rests primarily in decision making and paperwork. Captains are responsible for making sure a flight is conducted safely and legally, and carry more ""big picture"" responsibility. And even there, safer airlines have come to realize that treating a captain as an unquestionable authority is extremely unwise, and now first officers are typically more involved in the decision making processes.   It's plain old ignorant to insinuate that the captain taking the controls from the first officer was this flight's last hope, and that it was somehow too late because he was out of his seat.

In such a system, legislation is formed protectively with protectively-minded collaborating voters, not for the purpose of punishment but with the purpose of protection.  With this objective, punishments are predetermined (with planned variation that recognizes humanitarian values and the elasticity necessary for case by case details) so that corruption does not create harsher sentences or cushion favorites.   Unless the actions under judgment are among those that are already core criminal actions--such as taking life or maiming a person/people or taking or destroying property, the focus is not on actions themselves but on whether there is freedom of choice--are humans allowed to voluntarily exercise free will, or are they forcefully coerced into certain behaviors?   The freedom to join and unjoin organizations protects the rights of private organizations to have their own standards and requirements for participating members.  Public organizations have the responsibility to allow the exercise of any noncriminal behavior, not the right to restrict any form of noncriminal behavior.

' The result is a newly reinforced left, which has also benefited from the uncommon restraint of its opponents. On security matters there is a spirit of national responsibility.

' Most astonishing has been the appropriation by the left of patriotic values and the flag, usually a preserve of the right. The French left has long shied away from concepts like authority and national pride, and is unfamiliar with the idea of combining them with toughness on security. But the mix matches today’s mood, as well as Mr Valls’s personal political brand, robbing the right of its old monopoly.  ' The left’s gains may not last, however. There is still no sign of an economic upturn, and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Even now, only 24% of poll respondents think Mr Hollande is doing a good job on the economy. ...

worldevents,2tokdp,SoDark,6,Mon Jan 26 07:44:18 2015 UTC,"While I completely support your statement, and do feel that the term ""radical"" is usually applied pejoratively when it comes to beliefs that don't agree with the dominant pan-national capitalist economic framework out world runs on. However, the term ""radical"" in and of itself is not necessarily pejorative.   (especially of change or action) relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something; far-reaching or thorough. characterized by departure from tradition; innovative or progressive.   By itself, those aren't bad things. In this sense, Greece needs radical change, because business as usual and slow chsnges in small measure aren't working for the Greeks.  The EMU has failed Greece, even the AP conceded that fact. So is it ""radical"" for Greece to consider strategies that including breaking promises to a foreign body that put Greece through so much suffering, rejecting the banking superstructure it is now beholden to? Yes, in the sense that it is a dramatic, transformative change from what came before, it is ""radical."" But is it ""wrong"" or ""bad?"" No. It is necessary.  However, by invoking the word ""radical,"" one positions oneself on a certain side of an argument, making a statement about what ""normal"" and ""conventional"" are. That, in my opinion, is bad journalism, and the AP knows exactly what they're doing. Don't fool yourself, the AP is clearly on one side of the Banks vs. Communists (or whoever) argument. The AP is technically nonprofit cooperative owned by  1,400 U.S. daily newspapers, but those newspapers are largely owned by banks, so it's no surprise which team the AP bats for."

Nothing could be further from the truth, the entire power structure of Rhodesia was upheld through violence against the people of the country. The use and threat of violence was the only thing that enabled the 5% of the population that was white to rule over everyone else. Today people live with poverty, which is also a terrible indignity but it's far from having a government that considers you sub-human. The country's problems aren't as simple as ""the blacks took over,"" (it's Africa, everybody's black, shouldn't everyone have a say in how they're governed?) clearly the UDI government had to go, and clearly the place has been misgoverned since, but that doesn't mean Mugabe ruling til he's 100 was historically inevitable or anything. Plenty of black Zimbabweans have lost their lives, been seriously injured or lived under the threat of violence from the state or their neighbors resisting the ZANU-PF government.

What role did the Roman Church have in Spanish colonization generally and the European colonization of the Philippines specifically? What role has the Roman Church played in the destruction of indigenous institutions and social structures around the world, including the Philippines?

The religion is used in the same way gasoline is used to instigate fast and caustic 'burning' (intense emotions) by tapping into religious zeal and spreading the political message to more followers.  The political message is predominantly about Iran's regional dominance.  They will use any means to create chaos so that they can fill the power vacuum that arises, including supporting both sides of the conflict.    For the most part, their current economic means to do this has been limited.  However, this may only mean that they utilize more desperate schemes to reach their goals.

Through the use of deception and lies or force, what ever works to undermine Western secular values and pluralistic ideals are seen as fair game by the pious Muslim.  That is the problem.  Any Muslim at anytime can become this pious Muslim.  So this battle with Islam must be called for what it is and the war of ideas must be waged as soon as possible. Western values and the appreciation of pluralism and secular law start in our hearts and minds and must be spread through rational means to the benighted masses in the Muslim world.
