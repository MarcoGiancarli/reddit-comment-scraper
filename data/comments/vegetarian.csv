No matter what you do or say you will be preachy in their mind. I've never had someone say to me ""oh wow it was great how you didn't pressure me to give up meat, that really caused me to reflect on my actions"" being passive and coddling isn't worth it to people who are upset by your very existence. I'm not saying to relentlessly bring it up but you should really call out ignorant things people be say and be firm. Facts are on your side, not their's. You may not ""win"" any arguments but you can plant seeds. There is a neat series of videos on youtube called ""why are you so angry"" that I suggest you watch. It really deconstructs the behavior of people like who you mentioned in the op."

I honestly think some people are just afraid that if they open themselves to other people's opinions and arguments on food and animals they will feel guilty and will have to reconsider their lifestyle.

He kept insisting that it was really good and I should at least try a piece, so after five minutes of saying ""no thanks,"" I finally just said ""I don't eat meat, man.  Thanks anyway.  No big deal.""    Homeboy lost his mind and starting screaming at me about how he and his dad have hunted together since he was a boy and if I have a problem with that I should move to France.

I just say something like if you're honestly interested I wouldn't mind talking about it some other time when were not eating.  There's no great way of handling it really. Sometimes I just sit there with a smile on my face and just say uhuh, yea I'm glad you enjoy eating meat, it's not for me thanks , and keep it really simple. but truth be told, that lady would have called you preachy no matter what, it's just her attitude about vegetarians it has nothing to do with  you.

I just told them that I thought that was in poor taste and that I don't find it very appropriate. They got very offended at me saying that but all of the support was on my end from anyone that happened to see it.  But when there's people that keep pressing the issue and want to know why I don't eat meat, and they don't accept morals as an answer, I just tell them I really hate plants. Passionately hate plants.  The only 100% effective solution I've found is to remain calm and don't let them realize they're bugging you because the really annoying ones will keep getting more and more vocally annoyed when everyone else can see you're not doing anything.

I've encountered people who took personal offense at me being vegetarian because they raised cows, as did their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grandparents, etc.  To them, ""I am a vegetarian"" equaled ""I think you and your ancestors are doing something deplorable.""

""Is that *all?""  ""Where's your protein?""  ""oh you have to eat some meat.""  Actually no, I friggin' don't.  and I've never preached to others about their diets. You'd think that that would deter a few people from nagging me into a quivering anxious puddle who skips out on a group meal rather than show up and get passive aggressive comments.  When they tell me about how I ""can't possibly be healthy,"" I point out that eating the amount of meat that they do (they eat like 95% meat every day) has increased health risks that are worse than vegetarianism.   Or, depending on the rudeness of the comment, I'll go  ""Ha, never heard that one before.""  But for the most part, I just roll my eyes. I've never been one for controntation.

They automatically think you are taking a position of superiority by condemning something they like, even though that's not the reality of it at all. Whether you are a jerk about it or not, their small mind feels threatened by thinking outside of the mainstream box that is the life they know and are comfortable with.

As for your experience, it's just an unfortunate thing vegetarians will always have to put up with, until the distant enlightened future where animal torture is outlawed and sentient beings are all treated with compassion not merely because of laws, but because people actually recognize them as thinking, feeling things deserving of life. History shows that the communal sense of empathy takes a long time to expand its  circle to a wider body of life than what immediately resembles said community. But it does eventually happen.  The kind of stuff you had to put up with seems to happen when you're dealing with insecure people who perceive your diet as some kind of potential personal attack. That sounds absurd, but it's true. You can read this unfortunately titled article on the phenomenon if you'd like more insight."

vegetarian,3e4dzs,HerpDerpBlake,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"Beans and rice    Fry beans of choice (I like black beans and pinto beans) with cooked rice, chopped veggies of choice (onions, peppers, mushrooms, greens, etc) garlic, and cumin. Serve with guacamole or salsa. This goes really well in a wrap.    Peanut butter stew    Mix together 1 1/2 cups salsa, 2 tbsp tomato paste, and 1/2 cup water in a medium pot. Throw in veggies of choice (mushrooms, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli, peppers, onions, tofu, and chick peas all work well). Once veggies are cooked, add 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Stir until combined, and serve over rice. For an even cheaper version, sub the salsa and tomato paste for one medium can of crushed tomatoes.    Breakfast burrito   Make a filling out of some combination of hash browns, beans, quinoa or rice, seasonings (cumin, oregano, turmeric, nutritional yeast, hot sauce, etc) avocados, and salsa.    Oatmeal    Cheapest and easiest breakfast ever. Cook oats in boiling water (or soak overnight in almond milk) and top with fruit, cinnamon, a splash of maple syrup, and flax/chia seeds. Bulk oats seem to be much cheaper than pre-packaged    Curry    Pretty much any combination of coconut milk, curry powder, and curry paste will be delicious. I like to put tofu, sweet potato, and chick peas in my curries.    Lunch wrap    I found ""vegetarian chicken strips"" by blue menu at my local grocery store for 10 bucks for a huge box. Throw a couple cooked strips in a wrap with lots of crisp lettuce, mayo, and some mustard.    Sandwich    like you used to make them, but with Yve's salami or bologna.    Veggie burgers    it's important to find your own groove with these. I use beans, sweet potatoes, or mushrooms as a main ingredient, flavour with spices, soy sauce, and fishless worchestershire, add nut meal and/or flax meal, a bit of fat/oil, and some vital wheat gluten to hold everything together. I like to experiment with making meatless meatballs too.    Seitan    It takes a bit of a learning curve, but once you figure out how to make seitan you can make homemade nuggets, meatballs, and all sorts of other things. Would make a really good sesame ""chicken"".    Stir fry   Find your favourite sauce, and serve it with stir fried vegetables and rice   Spring rolls   Vietnamese rice paper is super cheap. You can stuff the spring rolls with all kinds of veggies   Sushi    A bit harder to make, but so worth it. If you don't have time for sushi, try making sushi-flavoured spring rolls or make a deconstructed sushi bowl (sushi rice with avocado, sweet potato, seaweed, sesame seeds, soy sauce, ginger, etc)    Pasta    You can't go wrong with spaghetti in marinara with bean balls and garlic bread    Protein shake    Blend 2 frozen bananas chopped into pieces, 1 tbsp protein powder, a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter, and a spoonful of cocoa powder with enough coconut milk to thin the texture.    As for snacks, hummus and veggies, nuts and seeds, fruit, and smoothies should do the trick.   Lentils are absolutely fantastic for adding protein while still being cheap and easy to make. I try to sneak them in my meals as much as I can."

vegetarian,3e326d,downgraded,4,Tue Jul 21 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty apathetic about being vegetarian. I don't eat meat because I don't eat meat. I don't much like how it tastes, and it's more expensive than buying vegetables in my area (NE US). It's also easier to cook vegetarian meals, imo, because vegetables are easier to get (they're in the backyard, or available frozen with no defrosting time) and generally don't require any work to be cooked aside from cutting them into manageable sized chunks - even then, that's only if I eat something like squash or carrots; green beans, peas, and corn are already the right size."
vegetarian,3e326d,Cerealcomma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"That's sort of what it's beginning to be to me, except it's texture.

And then chicken breast-- I didn't like the texture. Now it's chicken thighs-- where the blood veins are kind of unnerving.   But when it comes to something like turkey sausage or venison-- no issues. Although I suppose the best explanation is because I don't eat it with regularity."

If more people were brave enough to stand up and say ""no"" to unsustainable farm practices, we could affect real change. That is the fatal flaw of the human race - systemic apathy.  A quote paraphrased from Obama after the gay marriage ruling around a month ago - ""Real change occurs as a result of countless small acts of courage."" Don't tell yourself that you don't matter - you are all that matters.  There is nothing stopping you from doing the right thing except the same apathy that is killing the planet. You can change that, you can be strong and change the world.  All that said, pescetarianism is just about the worst possible diet you can adhere to. The oceans are on the edge of no return in the first place, and if you think fish farms are the answer you're wrong, the vast majority of them rely on the fishing of smaller fish to feed the larger fish they are breeding. It's a dying system all around. Look up any source on overfishing and you will see.  I only bring this up because I care. I was like you for a long time."
vegetarian,3e326d,FacialClaire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"If I were to be pescatarian, it would focus mainly on fish that I get from my family (they own a shrimp boat)-- my complaints about meat prices here have nothing on seafood prices, as they are normally upwards of $15/lb for shrimp. I agree that overfishing is a definite issue, just as much as ocean dumping.   The first part of your post was oddly motivating. Thanks for the post."
vegetarian,3e326d,FacialClaire,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted to become a vegetarian since I learned where meat came from. I was unfortunate enough that my parents weren't exactly good cooks when I was a child, which made it hard for me to appreciate vegetables. Becoming a vegetarian would have lead to a diet that would only consist of bread, potatoes and an apple a day. In fact, I only learned to like vegetables in college, where I was exposed to other people's cooking skills.   There were multiple things that lead me to becoming a vegetarian (at least, I'm trying). The first thing was the fact that my grandmother died of colon cancer. She really died a horrible death, she became very dependent very quickly and during the last month of her life she was barely able to eat. It was horrible to watch. Then my mother told me that pretty much everyone in our family dies from colon cancer (we all live past 90, but it's still always the same struggle). I knew right away that this isn't the way I want to die and so I looked up what could cause colon cancer, besides genetics. Turns out that meat consumption could play a big role. Then I decided to reduce my meat consumption to a maximum of three times a week.   Now once I started eating less meat, I realized I started disliking it more and more. When I did happen to eat meat, I couldn't stop overanalyzing what I was doing and it all just became so surreal to me. I just kept thinking ""I'm eating a goddamn leg right now. Some creature used to be able to walk with this. My legs are edible too. This isn't normal, chewing on a piece of dead leg shouldn't feel this normal. What the fuck am I doing?"". It made eating meat become unenjoyable, so I decided to stop doing it.  The environment isn't my main motivation, but it's a nice bonus to me. The reason why I don't want to eat meat is the same as why I don't smoke: I'm trying to avoid cancer and it feels like a very strange habit."
vegetarian,3e326d,Trippinstarballs,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in the same boat as you were in your first paragraph-- to this day, my dad refuses to eat anything that is either a) green or b) has onions in it, while oven-roasted vegetables is now a staple of my diet and something I enjoy eating (just as long as it has salt on it).   I'm just missing out on a mindfulness, like you had (well, also the apathy thing, but yea); I never think of the animal as it was, only as it appears to be at that moment. Do you eat eggs? How does that thought apply there?"

When I was little I refused to eat eggs because I was convinced that there could be a baby chicken coming them of it any minute. Once I learned that this wasn't the case, I couldn't get over how bad they smell. The same thing kind of happened to my relationship with mushrooms, I didn't want to eat mushrooms because I thought there were gnomes living in them, but mushrooms don't smell bad, so I learned to eat those."

vegetarian,3e326d,ENTP,2,Tue Jul 21 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"There isn't one ""right"" answer to the question of why be a vegetarian. Vegetarianism is a diet, not a belief system. By contrast, veganism is an ethical commitment and not a diet.  There are of course several wrong reasons to take on any diet, so always be sure that you are not doing it for one of those wrong reasons (like rapid weight loss or self-punishment).  As for the rest of the discussion, all I'll say is that your views will evolve over time. Let that happen. Vegetarianism really helped me to be impartial while I deeply considered the question of what rights, if any, should animals have. I had thought about it when eating meat, but I let inertia cause me to dismiss the arguments in favour of animal rights too quickly. I was invested in an outcome and therefore was biased. I believe most omnivores, and many vegetarians, are in a similar place."

One way you can always ask some quick questions at a resteraunt is to use SLACR (slacker).  Stock, lard, anchovies (or any fish), cross contamination, and rennet.  It's an easy way to remember what to look out for.  Products that say ""natural flavors,"" may or may not be vegetarian.  Always ask if the soups or sauces (I'm talking to u alfredo) are vegetarian, because at a resteraunt it's very likely made w chicken stock.  Beans, tapas, tortillas use lard often; often many asian dishes cross contaminate w fish/prawns.  If u eat fried foods or eggs (god I miss Fried eggs in the netherlands) there is often cross contam.  Usually dutch cheeses do not have rennet if actually done traditionally w whole milk.  Something else I learned in my time in the Netherlands: PARMAHAM is not PARMESEAN :D Best of luck!

I haven't vomited but it's bad at the other end.   I mainly eat rice currently. I make a huge batch of it and reheat it as I feel up to it. It's not great for you but it is extremely easy on your stomach.   If you can handle eggs, an omlette over rice makes a great meal. Eggs tend to ""stop things up"" so they're a great addition if you are having problems there. I learned that from constant lurking in /r/IBS and /r/CrohnsDisease.   If you're worried about not getting enough calories, I recommend switching to Ritz crackers or similar. They have more calories per serving than saltines and are slightly more nutritious.   I can also recommend drinking sweetened iced tea, if that's manageable. It makes throwing up slightly less awful.   Other than that, hmm. Avoid cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage and broccoli. Avoid legumes. Avoid acidic fruit and vegetables.   Gatorade has been an absolute lifesaver, literally. It hydrates you extremely well when you can't manage food. One of the doctors I saw mentioned that if I hadn't been drinking that, I would probably have needed to be in the hospital to get hydrated. So obviously that's a good choice if you can keep it down. Either find a place that has it on sale and stock up, or buy one of the powdered varieties and mix your own.     I hope you get better soon - that's an awful long time to be sick. What do the doctors think? Might an anti-emetic help? I've constantly had diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea since March or so, and I feel like I've had every single test under the sun - liver function, Celiac, pregnancy, and even malaria.

The coconut I find tends to be thicker and a bit creamier with more of a ""real milk"" taste if that makes any sense? It kinda has that tang of cow's milk (yeah that sounds gross lol).  Almond milk is more similar to soy milk but you should try the coconut too. I think Silk makes it.  Milk."

It went from like one per week (that take 5 days to heal...they're the worst!) to maybe one or two per year.  As for the coconut milk...I use it mainly in cereal. I don't like the it so much in coffee or tea, but I have recently been using a coconut creamer specifically made for coffee to imitate half and half.

It's possible you're allergic to something that is added to the packaged milks for thickening or sweetening or whatever. Making almond milk is super easy, just soak 1 cup almonds overnight, then rinse and blend with 2 cups fresh water, then strain with something fine enough to get the ground almonds out. You can add honey, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa powder, whatever you want to flavor it. It doesn't have as long of a shelf life as the store-bought cartons so I make it in smaller batches."

You can make coconut milk as well from unsweetened shredded coconut, which is less soak time. Definitely give it a quick google search, different nuts have different soaking times. Usually a 2-1 ratio of water to nuts makes a nice milk consistency, but you could always use more or less water to make it thicker or thinner."

Also, that almond one will taste alright, but not great.

It's awesome that you have made a big commitment for your own consumption! That's powerful, but actually not the biggest influence you can have. We are going to make the world vegan, and the way we spread that message and those ideas is through friends. When your friends who love and respect you see that you are so committed to the idea that animals aren't ours to abuse and slaughter for pleasure that you are willing to do it even if it's awkward and inconvenient - they will know it's a serious issue to you. And because they love and respect you, they will show the issue some respect as well.

I have very very few vegan friends and it's never an issue. I may be a little spoiled because I live in an area where I have lots of food options but you can normally adjust most menu items to fit within a vegan diet. If you're concerned call the restaurant ahead of time or speak to the waiter away from the table.   I eat vegan 90% of the time but am flexible in order to still take pleasure in eating with others (not examining everything) and have them take pleasure in my company.

They chose to accommodate to my choices rather than wherever they wanted to eat. Frankly, I don't like having my choices dictate how other people live their life. It's a weird social pressure that I don't like to participate in personally.   I've helped some family and friends cut back on their meat consumption a bit and shared simple recipes, mainly for health concerns, but some environmental and ethical concerns too. To me, that's the type of impact I want on the people that I care about, and the step in the right direction I'd want more people to take. I honestly never expect nearly any of them to become a full vegetarian or vegan, but say they eat meat 1 or 3 days less per week, I'd consider that victory enough.

vegetarian,3dz3i2,marvinandpercy,7,Mon Jul 20 21:54:01 2015 UTC,"Philosophically speaking though, isn't the argument of normativity irrespective of valuing ethics? Obviously society plays a part in sculpting the ethical frameworks of citizens (e.g. in the US and Canada, we may suggest that the idea of eating a dog would be immoral, but eating a cow would not. In India [not all regions, but moreso the Hindu-heavy regions] it may be argued that eating a cow would not be moral).  I hate using the slavery parallel, but it works here. Here in the US, slavery was a normal thing for a long time. However there were some that said it was not. When enough people argued that it was not ethical, we fought a war and eventually added into legality that slavery was illegal (legality is not an indicator of morality either, as many laws can be immoral, but much of the law is sculpted upon ethics).  I didn't major in philosophy, so I am not all too familiar with metaethics. But it seems a bit...fallacious to suggest that ""what would be considered normal in modern day society"" is a valid argument for not adopting an ethical viewpoint (be it veganism, buying fair trade, supporting LGBT rights, or any number of ethical viewpoints). Sorry if that last bit comes across as a bit dickish, I couldn't figure out a more eloquent way of putting it."

You mean subjectively arrogant, I guess? If subjectivism is true, you could assert his statement was arrogant, and I could assert that it was featherless. Are either of us actually right about it?"

vegetarian,3dz3i2,MusicalSavage,3,Tue Jul 21 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"Vegetarianism is not exercised exclusively due to ethical concerns regarding the treatment of animals.

I did not mean the moral principle is absolute hence the usage of the phrase 'something like'...I meant that whatever moral principle one chooses should be consistent across their beliefs. Replace   Mistreating animals for human consumption is wrong   with any other ethical concerns (health is hardly ethics in the sense vegetarians and vegans discuss it), and veganism is still the logical conclusion. If one thinks mistreating animals is okay and trashing the environment is okay, that's subjective ethics. It is another beast entirely to acknowledge those principles as unethical, and then sidestep acting upon them when it's convenient."

Ethically minded people, such as myself, consider the consequences of eliminating animals from the formal economy altogether (the end goal of veganism). Eliminating the need for these animals would cause them to become extinct, which most people would argue is worse than fixing the system to accommodate the animal's individual needs and well being. I would encourage you to read Peter Singer. He is a huge voice in the field of animal rights and actually advocates for vegetarianism over veganism."

The little bit of dairy and egg that I consume is akin to the bottles I forget to recycle, or the lights I accidentally leave on over night.

Things like whey are in so many items only because it is so ridiculously cheap due to the excess amounts generated by cheesemaking.  I'd rather people just settle on cutting out the big stuff than to go over every little detail and ensure it is vegan. Not to mention at times it can be difficult or even outright impossible to truly verify if something is vegan/vegetarian or not (to expand on that last note: The FDA mandates under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations that items may forego labeling and replace it with ""natural flavorings"" or similar categories [e.g. artificial flavourings] if it meets the criteria of the subsections in the linked clause. This does not factor in common allergens [so things like dairy or eggs must still be labeled], but does allow some elements of meat/fish/poultry to not be labeled. Outside of a subpoena, a company can have legal right to forego answering whether an item contains remnants of meat/fish/poultry inside of it. The amounts must be incredibly small [generally less than 2%], but if it meets that criteria and falls under one of the ingredients that may be protected under subsection 3(a) of CFR Title 21, it may forego true labeling of the ingredients. This is done primarily to protect trade secrets, as recipes cannot be copyrighted under federal law [techniques or steps may, but the actual recipe itself may not].)"

There's another brand at Whole Foods (I'm so sorry, I can't remember the name) that is awesome and I love to have it with pasta.   If you have a high powered blender there are some great recipes for making your own nut cheeses (normally using cashews). If you buy nuts in bulk it could be a fun cooking experiment."

I hate cooking, and it is easier/quicker/less frequent to cook vegetarian than vegan.  I also now have a husband who is a meat-eater, and while he tolerates good-naturedly the vegetarian cooking, he wouldn't be ok w/ vegan (hates beans/lentils/tofu).    Long Story:   When I first stopped eating meat 5 years ago, I went completely vegan overnight.   I did it for ethical reasons b/c (animal cruelty and cost to the planet of raising herbivores for food).    I was living in west Texas at the time and it was almost impossible but I never ate out and spent an inconceivable amount of my time outside of work procuring or making food, which I don't enjoy.  I eventually stopped getting invited out to things b/c I always said 'no' to dinner invitations b/c I didn't want to be the vegan that made everyone else uncomfortable when out to dinner by sitting there not eating or getting lettuce.  I was also working 12-hour days 6x days a week and had no interest or energy in cooking when I got home, and most vegan food that I could get ingredients for didn't keep well enough for me to cook on Sunday and freeze it for the rest of the week.  I'm sure it would have been technically edible but it was not palatable.   If I'm ever rich as fuck and have a personal chef/cook, I would be vegan.  Until then, vegetarianism it is."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:29 2015 UTC,"How is your vegetarian cooking so different from vegan cooking? Not being rude, just genuinely curious. Even when I was vegetarian I'd eat a lot of beans/lentils/tofu. I guess I couldn't have breaded cheese with potatoes dauphinoise anymore, but I feel like that is not what most vegetarians eat on a regular basis. Do you have any examples?"
vegetarian,3dz3i2,marvinandpercy,6,Tue Jul 21 02:31:24 2015 UTC,"The number one reason I don't eat a lot of beans, lentils, seitan, 'fake meat' items, quinoa salads, millet/buckwheat/chickpeas, and tofu is because my husband hates those things, and I'm not willing to spend more time cooking to make us separate dishes.  That also makes it more difficult to get enough protein without eggs .  Not impossible, but I'm also not going to put in a ton of extra time to get it done.    I have a two-week menu calendar, and one of those days is scalloped potatoes and salad.  Another day is cheese pizza b/c he can't cook and I work super late on Tuesday nights.  Another night is couscous w/ a hard-fried egg and sriracha sauce (which isn't substantial enough w/out the egg).  Another night is mushroom risotto, which is pretty terrible tasting without a little cheese.  Those are the worst offenders.  The meals we eat are probably not what many vegetarians will eat.    I make a lot of casseroles b/c they're easy for me to make ahead of time and freeze.  I'd say half of them have milk or cheese in them, and they are NOT good without that ingredient. There are 2 reasons I don't veganize them: 1) I have tried every single kind of vegan cheese I have come across in a grocery store.  (I look ridiculous checking out but I seriously try each new one I come across when I move) I have never found one that doesn't taste like chemicals to me.  2) I'm not going to make Vegan Cream of XYZ soup that goes into it from scratch, and Vegan Cream of Anything is hard to find in my area.  3)Also, eggs in lots of those things that reheat well.    I'm also wildly picky, as is my husband, so I have to find things that go with both our pickiness.  I acknowledge that there are ways for me to veganize things, or to substitute out meals that are inherently not vegan, but then I end up taking us down the road of 'didn't grow up knowing this plant/grain existed, it's weird, and I don't like it' and one or the other of us will hate it.  That's what happened with the kale salad experiment last week.    Dinners are actually relatively easier vegan-wise, because I am going to throw some veggies on the grill right away anyway.  But leftover grilled asparagus (insert whatever vegetable you like there) the next day just isn't something I like.  Which leads me to the cafeteria where I eat something unhealthy like cheese pizza.  I know myself, I know I won't like the leftovers, and if I'm not happy with my lunch I'm going to go buy something unhealthy, so it is just easier to make things that aren't vegan that I will eat in the first place.    Plus, a good part of it is not being willing to spend hours in the grocery store looking at labels.  I'll make sure I buy non-rennet cheese (the grocery store I live near labels their cheeses w/ vegetarian rennet very well/consistently).  I buy vegan butter and vegan mayonnaise.  But I won't make 2 separate dishes so I can make one with almond/soy milk and one without, and while egg substitutes work well in baking, not so much in cooking.  I always make sure I don't buy things with gelatin but I'm not going to search for vegan sugar, or wine, or.... take your pick on any of the things that aren't regularly labeled as such.    Also, I have to wear leather (actually suede).  There is no way around that.  We have a Congressionally mandated uniform, suede boots are part of it, and I either have to get out of the military or wear the suede.  I wear the suede."

I just do the best I can.  When I know, I can make decent arrangements ahead of time.  If there is anything vegan/vegetarian, I eat it even if I don't like it.

If my H&H are even on the low end of normal, my asthma gets exacerbated, but I also frequently donate blood to nonprofits.  So for my health and my ability to donate, I'm not switching to vegan.  I'm also worried that I would miss out on social and cultural experiences.

vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,0,Mon Jul 20 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"Are these deficiencies that you have seen in a blood test or you just think you are deficient?  I will say that I have been chronically iron deficient (even as a meat eater) and my iron levels have been best on a vegan diet. There is some evidence that you are more likely to be iron deficient on a vegetarian diet as opposed to a vegan diet.   Why do you think you have trouble meeting those other micronutrients? Do you not eat a lot of fruit and veg (not a judgement, just a question). I start my day with a big green smoothie and add hemp seed, chia seed, and spirulina.   I am also a blood donor! Good for you!  As far as the social and cultural experiences, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Occasionally I have to pre-eat before going to an event because I am unsure of the food options but cocktails are (normally) always vegan so it's all good!"
vegetarian,3dz3i2,nursingstudent77,9,Mon Jul 20 20:35:57 2015 UTC,"I am 24 and I have osteopenia, which was diagnosed via imaging tests.  My last several blood tests have shown my H&H to be borderline low, which also correlated with an exacerbation of my asthma.  I think I have trouble meeting those other micronutrients because I'm not willing to get into further debt (just completed college in May) by making expensive smoothies with a blender I don't own.  And I know I have trouble meeting those requirements by using supertracker.gov periodically to evaluate how I'm doing nutritionally.  While you may not feel you are missing out on anything, I already do as a vegetarian.    I don't understand why you feel the need to tell me how great your experience is as a vegan as though it somehow makes my experiences invalid.  It doesn't.  I respect your experiences, please respect mine and my health.  Your reply to my post reminds me of how meateaters questioned me when I became a vegetarian.  The OP's original question was polite because it was directed towards vegetarians, not one person in particular.  My personal diet is not up for public debate.  If you are trying to convince me to become a vegan, you are doing a terrible job of it."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, you obviously came into this subreddit excepting judgement and debate.   My post was not confrontational or rude. It was conversational and I asked you a couple of questions. You are welcome to ask me whatever question you would like.   I don't understand why you feel the need to tell me how great your experience is as a vegan as though it somehow makes my experiences invalid.   I didn't invalidate any of your experiences. I think you are projecting.   I think I have trouble meeting those other micronutrients because I'm not willing to get into further debt (just completed college in May) by making expensive smoothies with a blender I don't own.    Another clear example of projection. Why do you assume I spend a lot of money on my smoothies? I buy chia and hemp in bulk. I am in grad school so I understand money woes. My smoothie was meant to give you an example of the foods I eat to help meet my micronutrient requirements, not a dictation of what you need to be doing.  If you can't have a conversation without taking everything personally (especially when I in no way attacked you) perhaps you need to take a break from the internet.   I'm sorry you think that I was being confrontational but I wasn't. If you read the rest of my responses to people on this thread you will see I have been nothing but kind and genuinely interested in people's responses. If you take a step back and read my response to you again you will see that I was genuinely interested in your experience too."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,marvinandpercy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"Are these deficiencies that you have seen in a blood test or you just think you are deficient?   That was very rude. I actually came into thread because I was genuinely interested in the variety of reasons vegetarians are not vegans.  I just looked at your other responses, as you requested.  You seem more interested in why vegetarians should be vegans than hearing what they have to say."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:35 2015 UTC,I don't understand how that was rude? It was an honest question. I have assumed I was deficient in things before but blood tests have confirmed the opposite to be true. My responses to what you have to say can be very much dependent on if you are actually deficient or if you are just worried about being deficient.   This is where the projection issue you are having is coming through. Asking a question is not a judgement.    You seem more interested in why vegetarians should be vegans than hearing what they have to say.   Well obviously I am interested in people being vegans but I am pretty sure you are the only one who perceives me as not being interested in hearing people out as I have had several pleasant conversations. You're the only person who has lashed out.
vegetarian,3dz3i2,nursingstudent77,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:36 2015 UTC,"Concur w/ /u/nursingstudent77.  Both you and the other combative/invasive/judgy person I just responded to either need to be honest with yourselves (not me, I don't give a fuck) and admit you want to be the preachy/invasive/debate-y/judgy kind of veg*n or you need to learn how to rephrase things and not ask certain questions.  You both act like you're shocked when people take offense but always assume that it is their over-sensitivity, instead of you being preachy/invasive/debate-y/judgy.    There is a reason why I have subscribed/unsubscribed from this subreddit half a dozen times, and it is because I have come to expect this kind of masked 'I'm just trying to inspire debate' rudeness.  People subscribe to this subreddit looking for support/info for their particular brand/version of veg&n, not to be preached at.  You can call your line of questioning not preachy, but just know that a lot of other people then think you're both preachy and lack a stunning amount of self-awareness or social understanding."

I'm honestly surprised that people would respond to this post and then be upset about people asking questions or making suggestions. The entire premise of the thread set itself up for such a conversation. I like to talk to people about veganism and have never denied that. I have not, however, been rude or confrontational."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,marvinandpercy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that I'm not the only person who views your questions this way- just the only person willing to call you out on it?  After all, by calling you out I am ""projecting""  ""expecting judgment and debate"" ""taking things personally""  ""the only one who perceives xyz""  ""lashing out"" and ""need to take a break from the internet.""  You are the vegan making unasked for suggestions to individual vegetarians on how to be vegan."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,4,Mon Jul 20 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"This is why I have subscribed/unsubscribed from this subreddit multiple times.  People are too preachy and judgmental, which, I have no problem with in appropriate situations, but which is not appropriate when unsolicited.  They have every right to be preachy and judgmental, but they also need to expect that people will call them out on it, and the old 'projecting' attack is getting old.  I will likely unsubscribe again today because I feel like you and I are the only veg&ns who will call people out in this sub-most others enable them.  (Non-veg&ns call people out regularly, but most veg&ns here won't)."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,5,Mon Jul 20 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry you've had a bad experience. There are post flair tags on the sidebar where you can filter only through content you want to see. As of now, we haven't figured out a way to reduce this sort of hostility. I honestly don't think it's possible, given that veg*nism is an ethical and moral position for many and therefore people will inherently take these discussions personally."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,marvinandpercy,6,Mon Jul 20 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  I think there is a ton of goodness in this sub- there are a lot of people like me who come here just to feel like a regular human-being.     I am in the military, and those folks don't trend towards veg&n lifestyles.  I know ZERO other veg&ns in real life and we also tend to get stationed out West or in the Southeast, so just being vegetarian takes an outrageous amount of effort.   I can appreciate people feel strongly and why.   I also don't think that being judgmental and preachy is necessarily a terrible thing (this is the internet, and it lets people speak more freely b/c of anonymity), but I also think people need to recognize the time/place.  If there was a thread titled ""Vegans, what are some of the most BS excuses you've heard from vegetarians about why they aren't vegan?"" I would either skip it or expect to hear preachiness/judgmental answers.  But OP's wording in this particular thread didn't give that vibe so people came to give their honest answers and got shamed.    Thanks for all the great things about this sub.  It is what keeps people coming back.  Sometimes you get bad w/ good, but nothing is perfect."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,deeepseadiver,3,Mon Jul 20 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"Since you are replying, in your opinion have my replies come off as rude or judgmental? I have been trying to have a conversation with people who I thought were open to having a conversation (which should have been a safe assumption as they replied to the thread)."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,nursingstudent77,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"No part of my reply was judgemental. I really am honestly confused as to why people would be upset about asking questions based on their reply. I also do not understand how offering suggestions that have worked for me is ""preachy"". The only thing I know how to do is offer helped based on my personal experiences.   My question about her nutritional deficiencies was not out of a place of malice. I was asking honestly and genuinely and unfortunately reading through text can mask that. I have had concerns with nutritional deficiencies and thankfully (besides my issues with iron) they have been unfounded.   Her post resonated with me because I am also a blood donor and being able to donate blood is a primary concern and I get very upset when I am unable to.   So, without downvoting me because you disagree, can we come to an understanding that I am not preachy or judgemental and perhaps point out ways in which I could have phrased things more appropriately. The internet is not the perfect medium for these conversations because you lose my tone of voice and facial expressions. I am a very sweet person and I guarantee if I said these things in person you would be happy to have a conversation with me.  I think part of the other users responsibility is to recognize that tone and facial expressions are lost over the internet and to just read things as they are."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,whispers21,4,Mon Jul 20 23:47:51 2015 UTC,"Ok.    I think the key is understanding solicitation and vibe of the thread.   As to solicitation, if someone solicits your advice, you give it.  You don't have to coddle them or word it perfectly or sugarcoat it because they are soliciting your feedback.  They're expecting to hear some things they might not agree with because they're asking the question, and because they initiate the question, they open themselves to criticism.  Of course, feel free to be honest w/your feelings/advice even when unsolicited but expect that people will bristle at it.    As to vibe, I (and it would seem a lot of the people answering his/her question) found OP's tone to be pretty positive.  By that, I mean, I found the original post to be open/accepting to people who are just vegetarian.  That means that respondents are responding to a question that they know is controversial (for this sub), but which they are willing to answer because of the tone that OP set, which OP then reiterated to someone (ironically who is one of the most judgmental people here) further down the comments.  If the title of the post had been ""Vegetarians, what are your excuses for contributing to the pain and suffering of laying hens and dairy cows"" then respondents should expect to be engaged in a judgmental/preachy manner (I recognize that is an exaggerated example, but it serves the purpose).  Of course, people are free to comment as they like regardless of tone/vibe, but can't then claim victimhood when they're called out for being preachy/judgmental.  I honestly truly don't care about people being preachy or judgmental, but I really hate when people aren't aware (and/or insist they aren't even though they know they are) of how judgmental/preachy they come off (in part b/c I am not militant in my demands of others but I am affected b/c veg&ns have a well-deserved stereotype because some veg&ns don't realize how preachy/judgmental they come off).    Full disclaimer: I do have conflicting feelings about my own choices b/c I am vegetarian and not vegan, and the reason really boils down to convenience, so there is a certain amount of personal conflict inherent in my response/reactions to the controversy.  I really see both sides of the story b/c I have lived/am living both sides, but I just absolutely hate that there is conflict b/w some vegetarians and some vegans when we would have a lot more influence if we could all get along."
vegetarian,3dz3i2,yourlycantbsrs,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that you are taking things way too personally and I am trying to be nothing but friendly and helpful?  If someone wanted to ""call me out on it"" as you say, they would have done it as this is the internet and there's no consequence in doing so. Instead people have responded to me in kind and we have had good conversations.   You're acting like I have no idea what it is like to be a vegetarian. I've been on both sides. Some people really are unaware of vegan alternatives and it's not wrong to let people know about them.   You clearly are lashing out and projecting if you're getting this worked up over suggestions. I have said nothing rude and have not instituted any personal attacks.  Have a pleasant day."

That is a real thing. I didn't question the legitimacy of European vegans, nor did I insult them in any way. And being European doesn't mean you are part of that culture, first of. Where you are born and which culture you come from are two very different things. Second of all, for me to take the meat out of pelmeni makes them dumplings. Take the salt pork out of kroppkakor makes them basically boiled mashed potatoes. I give those and others up, I don't eat those with my family. But who are you to tell me that I should give up the Swedish pancakes, kringle, and krumkake cookies and then dare to say that it won't affect my relationship with my heritage. You didn't offer a solution because you didn't listen to the problem. And you were rude.   As for the Polish woman, she's allowed to decide on her own how she is and is not going to express her culture. You and I don't get a say in that."

You're making the assumption that either you can only care about one thing at a time or that we don't care about those things - both of which are not true.

I've lost quite a bit of weight, I've never felt healthier and I have more money than I used to when I ate a lot of meat meals. That's three very big wins. Also, as my vegetarianism has no direct connections to animal issues, that isn't really a factor for me.  I simply see no added benefit to being a vegan from where I am now. I certainly don't see veganism as 'going all the way' either. It's a different diet to vegetarianism that people adopt for similar, but often somewhat different reasons. It doesn't interest me in the slightest and unless I become intolerant to dairy at some stage I won't consider adopting it."
vegetarian,3dyipz,shuddertostink,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, there's good reason squash is usually small in stores. The larger it gets, the more bitter and tough the flesh becomes :(   I usually end up with a lot of squash that are just way too big to saute and eat normally. It's like... I'll go out in the morning and it'll be juuuust too small to pick, and when I go back in the evening suddenly it's bigger than my leg.   I have a few favorite recipes for this, though.  Zucchini bread, which I usually add chocolate chips to and omit walnuts because of allergy concerns.  Zucchini breakfast cookies - CAUTION HIGH FIBER CAUTION DON'T EAT A MILLION OF THESE OR YOU'LL POOP A LOT  Zucchini cookies  Also, if you're into preserving food, shredding squash or zucchini and then drying it in a dehydrator produces a delicious soup base that can be used through the year."

There is no inherent morality to nature, as this picture suggests. Also its tone is insufferably preachy and accusatory.  Ethical vegetarianism is a voluntary decision to impose restrictions on yourself for personal reasons. It is not a human duty that everyone else is failing at. Like someone posted already, it isn't the lion's duty to take care of the gazelle, or the bear's duty to take care of the fish. The world is not a Disney film.  If you want to have mercy on the lives of animals, that's your choice and your reward. You can educate others, but don't force your views on them."
vegetarian,3dtzl3,cyrux,5,Sun Jul 19 23:30:15 2015 UTC,To say animals are individuals doesn't mean we have a duty to take care of them (my neighbor is an individual and I have no duty to take care of him).

I'd like to think that's practically everyone, so I feel fairly comfortable calling it a human duty. We're not lions nor bears, and we can empathize with and thrive without murdering other creatures. We're moral and should act upon that.  And you're absolutely right, the world isn't a Disney film: that is why we need to be serious and actually deal with issues, instead of brushing them under the rug for the sake of some bullshit ""solution"". We need to make the world a better place instead of saying, ""Huh, this all sucks, but I gotta deal with it I guess!""  Oh, and do you mean we shouldn't force our views on others like they force theirs on the animals abused and killed in their name every day? You're equating advocating against mass murder with... advocating for it. Now 'scuse me if I seem a little narrow-minded here, but I feel like that first one has way more merit somehow!

It makes both sides uncomfortable at any gathering where there is food, but that's all that gets accomplished, here.  Humans have been hunters as well as gatherers for the whole of our existence, and now our bodies have physically contoured to better suit those tasks. Only now (most people) have the luxury of making decisions to remove meat from our diets, because we're not struggling to survive on whatever food we can find. We have that individual decision to make, whether or not we want to eat it.  It nears religious territory to argue that animals are on the same tier of sentience and importance as humans.

You're always gonna make people uncomfortable or even angry when you hold up a mirror to their face and show them how what they're doing is awful. No two ways about it.  And again, it's not just an individual decision. There's a third party involved, and that party is animals. Your decision directly affects them. Sure, you can decide to keep eating animal products, but then you have to live with that. And I won't not tell you what you're doing, because animals have a right to live. You don't have a right to be ignorant.   It nears religious territory to argue that animals are on the same tier of sentience and importance as humans.   That's interesting to me. Same tier of sentience is probably easily disproved scientifically. A mealworm doesn't have the same awareness as a human, sure. But importance is so purely subjective, I'd really like to know how you justify that humans are more important.  And to your last sentence: I'm not forcing anything on anyone. I am literally only telling them what I think. And I'm gonna reiterate my previous comment again, but they are forcing something on others.

That can at times be an issue of you not getting enough vitamin C in your diet. See this study to know I'm not BSing you.  So next time you have some lentils or some beans, add some lemon to the mix or add it in to some water whilst drinking meals.  Also try your best to avoid coffee, alcohol, and similar beverages whilst eating. Coffee and many alcohols are loaded in tannins, which act as an absorption inhibitor for minerals such as iron. Also for foods conventionally looked at for iron (read: spinach), make sure to either eat young leaves (baby spinach) if you want it raw, or cook the leaves if you have older/matured leaves. In the case of spinach and some other dark, leafy greens, they hold other absorption inhibitors such as oxalates, which also disrupt iron absorption.

Sesame seeds can be added to a ton of other things to increase iron content. Tofu also has a pretty good amount of iron.  When you do cook, using an iron skillet would increase your intake.  Eating vitamin C containing foods will help increase your iron absorption.  May I ask, how has your consumption of B12 been?  I  ask because it is involved in the production of red blood cells, is found mainly in animal products, and is pretty high in seafood. A lack of B12 results in anemia.  Also you mention you've been purposefully watching your iron intake, so you may very well be getting enough iron.  If this is something you've already considered, I apologize for sidetracking.

vegetarian,3dwjj2,razuku,2,Mon Jul 20 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"Have you tried adding cold or marinated chickpeas to your salads? Also tahini based salad dressings or peanut butter based salad dressings could really fill out salad flavor variety and give more sources of lasting energy.   I think combining sources of vitamin c with high iron foods helps with iron absorption, for example added tomato pieces or citrus in the dressing. Also, if you drink coffee or tea those both make it harder to absorb iron, if so try to keep those at least an hour away from your iron rich foods.  For some salad variety have you considered Tabouli a salad made of unrefined cracked wheat, tomatoes, mint or parsley, onion and/or garlic and dressed with olive oil, lemon juice and salt? Here's a recipe with nutritional info Mediterranean Tabouli Salad. Basically the precooked cracked wheat just sits in very hot water like from a kettle or microwave for about 10 minutes and then you toss it with all the other chopped vegetables and herbs. It's easy to make the night before and it stores well for several days in the refrigerator. Or in a rush, while it was absorbing the hot water you could chop everything else and then put it all the the same container and shake as you leave.  Have you tried making your own hummus? It's easy to make a big batch in advance, it also stores well in the refrigerator and if you eat some with sliced vegetables it would be a really fast, healthy meal that is a nice alternative to cereal, but just as easy to eat when you don't feel like cooking or are very busy. Hummus recipe, and here's a chart of hummus variations for new flavor ideas too. Also if you get some snack sized bags of dried fruit and nuts like trail mix that is an excellent snack for energy on a long day and easy to keep in a purse or other day bag.

Also eggplants contain a natural form of nicotine a little like how peppers have capsaicin, and I'm sure that adds to them being more of an acquired taste than some vegetables. The Chinese/Japanese eggplants seem milder that way. Also they are great very lightly battered, deep fried and served in a soy, garlic, ginger, and sugar sauce on rice."

I am ethically opposed to the meat industry and how the animals are treated, not the actual eating of meat. I don't want to support those businesses and encourage their behavior so not a dime of mine will go toward meat that I believe was sourced unethically.

Responsible hunting is much different than most people imagine, and drastically different from the meat industry."

You clearly don't care what I have to say, you just want to criticize me.  Hunting isn't killing for no reason, as convenient as it would be for you to believe that. There is often a net positive effect for the population, and the meat is being eaten. Meat that replaced grocery store meat which comes from much more horrible conditions than an animal who lived a happy natural life and died in frankly the most humane way it could. Of all the ways for a deer to die in the woods, a quick bullet through the heart is the best by far."

vegetarian,3dtfe1,janewashington,5,Sun Jul 19 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it is ideal.  It's similar to the gluten free fad.  I'm sure it's mildly annoying for someone who is legitimately gluten intolerant that so many people pretend to be nowadays, but it's far outweighed by the fact that it make being gluten-free much, much easier.  Vegetarians, vegans, pescaterians, flexitarians, people who only occasionally eat meat are:  1) All reducing the amount of animals that are killed for food.  The number one goal for most vegans and vegetarians.  2) Making the availability of vegetarian food much more common at restaurants, grocery stores, etc.  and making it much more socially acceptable to be vegetarian.  This in turn, makes it easier for more people to become vegetarian, vegan, pesca, flexi, etc., reducing animal consumption more.  This far outweighs the minuscule inconvenience it creates for you to sometimes have to say that no, you don't eat fish."
vegetarian,3dtfe1,fastpaul,2,Sun Jul 19 21:27:52 2015 UTC,Those benefits can be realized if flexitarians accurately describe themselves too.   It's not like they're required to call themselves vegetarians to make those things happen.

vegetarian,3dtfe1,PopeSaintHilarius,12,Sun Jul 19 09:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yes this is much better. Flexitarians still save a lot of animals, are far healthier and have a smaller environmental impact than someone who eats a lot of meat."

Nonetheless, if, say, someone cooked you meat daily you'd eat it.  It's perfectly fine to be a meat-eater, seriously. Just don't tarnish vegetarian's cause with your pseudo-valiance."
vegetarian,3dtfe1,birdy111,3,Sun Jul 19 09:43:52 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting point. I normally hate labels. But I have a friend who is a ""vegtarian"" and in the 2 years that I've known her I've only seen her eat vegetarian once and it was a veggie burger. Everytime we eat in a restaurant she orders meat and every time we eat at her place she's cooking meat. It's like as  a society we place so much value on labels but not our behavior. I asked her once, why don't you tell peopl you don't eat much meat, or something to that effect. And she jus says how she hardly ever eats meat and she's basically a vegetarian anyways so why bother. It is so important to her to call herself a vegetarian although it no way reflects her Actions or behaviors. But I don't see a problem with people who say they only eat meat on occasion, or eat a flexitarian diet. I encourage any form of reducing animal intake but this is one area where I do kinda like labels."

vegetarian,3dslhk,iamsoupercool,10,Sun Jul 19 01:34:54 2015 UTC,"Your protein requirements will vary based on your activity levels.  Athletes and weight lifters often go for around 1g per pound of body weight (or more), but if you're not in those groups, the MFP recommendation is probably about right (note that it increases when you add exercise).  As for getting protein, you'll surely receive lots of good advice here, I'll throw in my two cents as well.  Vegans will hate this list, but dairy is a great place to start.  Here's my usual stuff, values are per-serving...  Dairy: * Fat Free Cottage Cheese (5g carbs / 15g protein) * Greek Yogurt (5g carbs / 11g protein) * Hard Cheeses (varies, but a good ratio) * Eggs -don't hurt me! (2g carbs / 31g protein)    Nut/Veggie: * Edamame (16g carbs / 17g protein) * Hummus (31g carbs / 19g protein) * Black Beans (41g carbs / 15g protein) * Chickpeas (45g carbs / 15g protein) * Almonds (21g carbs / 20g protein) * Walnuts (16g carbs / 18g protein) * Tofu (2g carbs / 10g protein)   <----awesome! * Lentils (40g carbs / 18g protein)    On days that I strength train and need an extra boost, I drink a couple of whey isolate shakes (3g carbs, 28g protein, tons of amino acids).  There are quite a few non-dairy options with protein shakes (rice/hemp/pea/soy), just do your homework on them first.  Also, don't overlook packaged ""fake"" meat, they really jam that stuff with protein (and carbs, unfortunately).  They're pricey, but it's nice to have a go-to brat or burger to bring to barbecues or for lazy meals, and there are some great products on the shelves these days.  As soon as I hit save I'll remember five more, but hopefully that little list gives you some ideas  :]"

But some people think ""more is always better"" when it comes to protein, which can get ridiculous.   For example, they'd be eating 175 grams of protein if they weighed 175 pounds (and many weight lifters weigh more than that). Well, that sells protein shakes, but is probably way more than they need. According to this: http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/protein#ath the HIGH recommendation is 1.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. 175 pounds is 80 kilograms. So that ends up being about 144 grams of protein - more than 30 grams difference."

vegetarian,3dqz6a,GoGoBamBam,9,Sat Jul 18 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"The article is really asking if meat can be sustainable, not a benefit to the environment, but I can think of a few areas where it is.    Aquaponics comes to mind and Mussel farming can have a net positive on the environment because of their water pollution cleaning abilities.  Raising your own chickens also has a lot of benefits, lost in factory farming settings, like environmentally friendly fertilizer and pest control.  I have a vegan friend who raises urban chickens, mostly for the fertilizer and to control garden pests.  Their eggs go to his dogs and neighbors.  They only require chicken feed for a few months a year."
vegetarian,3dqz6a,freethis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"Eating mussels because they filter out water pollution doesn't sound very appetizing. More like a reason to avoid them considering all the crap we dump downstream.    Also, I've had chickens.  Their poop attracted more bugs than they ate as far as I could tell. And compost was easier to use and cheaper than raising them for their poop. Ours certainly needed feed year round.  And calcium supplements because they laid eggs."

Yet they get subsidized and citizens get taxed."
vegetarian,3dqz6a,SnaquilleOatmeal,10,Sat Jul 18 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"The second, issue, Mitloehner said, is that what I’d been thinking of as the ""waste products"" of animal agriculture are actually valuable resources. The manure animals produce is vital for agriculture (especially organic agriculture). ""If we were to reduce the fertilizer animals produce by 100 percent, we would have to double or triple the amount of chemical fertilizer we apply, and we just don’t have that,"" Mitloehner said.   Wow, you'd think that there wouldn't be life on earth without cow shit or petroleum based fertilizers! They need to read The Humanure Handbook, for starters. We can't just keep taking from the earth and not putting back, but we don't have to rely on domesticated animals. There is also composting, especially now as more cities offer municipal composting. Veganic farming methods can work! But it feels like some farmers have gotten so used to using cow shit because it's a cheap ""waste"" product that they forgot that there are other options."

vegetarian,3dqz6a,peteftw,5,Sat Jul 18 18:42:07 2015 UTC,I think the biggest counterpoint is: how much less fertilizer will we need when we don't have to feed animals? That's almost a 12:1 loss of energy. 1/12th the agriculture in a meat free system? We should be able to come up with enough fertilizer.

vegetarian,3dqz6a,IjsKind,5,Sat Jul 18 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"Depends what's in it and how you do it, but yeah, the whole point is to return nutrients back to the soil. If you feed stuff to the cow, she is going to take out further nutrients to live. Yeah, she's going to break the stuff down quicker than just leaving it in a pile somewhere, but you can do compost pretty quickly when you take care to build an ecosystem of beneficial bacteria and fungus and even wild animals that can come and go freely (like worms and insects).  But again, we're going to end up needing more if we keep taking nutrients out of the system and shitting them into perfectly good drinking water and then shipping that elsewhere to be treated and disposed of. This isn't solved by adding in cows that still take, take, take. That's why humanure, as crazy as it might sound, needs to be a part of the plan for a sustainable future and why I highly encourage people to read The Humanure Handbook (online for free and it does a good job of explaining the difference between properly treated humanure vs. fresh night soil)."
vegetarian,3dqz6a,AdrianBlake,4,Sat Jul 18 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I don't consider myself very knowledgeable on the subject, but I did want to just make one comment on this.  My uncle has been composting for about twenty years or so and his garden is absolutely gorgeous.  He doesn't use any type of fertilizer at all and he continuously has the biggest tomatoes, cucumbers, and the most potatoes x beans, peas, etc... He's grown 100lb pumpkins and even grew watermelons one year (hard to do in NW Montana without a temperature controlled greenhouse).  So I guess you could say it could be done without fertilizer."

In fact, the population could do with quite a bit of culling-- That would help the environment. Is the wolf immoral for killing and eating a deer? No, of course not. Why would we hold humans to a different standard? Especially when dying of a gun shot wound is a lot less painful and being eaten alive. (Because wolves don't wait for their meal to stop breathing before starting on it's hind quarters.)"

You might be surprised the demand for meat in your area. Go and crunch the numbers -- how many people are in your area, how many pounds of meat they eat on average. You honestly think there are that many deer around?   And what do you base 'that would help the environment' on? Because some deer ate your roses or something?   And why do we hold wolves and humans to different ethical standards? Are you for real?! Maybe because we have choices and can understand our choices? You want to argue morality with a wolf and tell them to go buy some beans instead? If a wolf rapes another wolf, does that mean we get to hold humans by that standard? Yeah, pretty bad logic."
vegetarian,3dqz6a,comfortablytrev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"We are talking about making meat environmentally friendly. That was the question. Not whether or not it is moral to eat meat in the first place. The question was asked, I answered it, and I'm oh so very sorry that you do not like the answer, but there it is. Meat is environmentally friendly when it is hunted (for the most part). When hunting is done right, in proportion to the community being hunted, across the ages and sexes of the species, it is environmentally friendly way to eat meat. (I'm ignoring most of your response because you are obviously emotional and there is nothing to gain when arguing with overly emotional people.)"

The conversion of sunlight to energy for plants is terribly inefficient - somewhere in the area of 3 to 6 percent of total solar radiation - and eating meat adds another step to the process before it gets to us.  Under optimal conditions, in ""factory farms,"" it takes 17 lbs of plant matter as feed to produce 1 lb of ground beef.  So already that's a ton of energy - literally a 17-fold increase - because you had to have a ground beef hamburger instead of a portabello mushroom burger.  Add in the 97% wasted bio-energy that's lost in the first step, and if you care at all about the environment, rather than just pretend like you do, you will become vegetarian immediately and vegan eventually"

I wouldn't expect him to cook me something that he doesn't like, and vice versa. A lot of the time we make something where the meat can be added in. If the issue is that your SO doesn't have the time, he could always make a big batch ahead of time, like baking a couple chicken breasts, storing them in the fridge, and removing as needed to add. But honestly, the longer you stick with it, the less he's going to be adding in meat. When I first switched what I ate, my SO was constantly adding in extra animal products.

We'll do stir fry and he'll add whatever meat he wants. In the winter, I tend to make one pot meals of rice, lentils and veggies and we'll sometimes put a fried egg on top, or he'll add chicken on top.  He's recently become more invested in his diet and has noticed that his body responds well to eating a lot of protein and veggies, so he's more insistent on including meat for himself. We've been together for a year now, and my vegetarianism has never been an issue for us, so I'm excited to see how this will improve my creativity in the kitchen.

And my husband and all boyfriends have always completely backed that, as it was their opinion too that it was not OK to make a vegetarian cook meat. If my husband wants meat in the house, he buys it.   Currently in our house, my husband and I often eat separate meals because we have different schedules, so that is easy. But when we cook together it's vegetarian. Sometimes we'll make something meat can be added to for his portion (like separately topped pizzas), but usually if he wants meat he just makes it as a separate snack outside of meal time, like he'll have a piece of chicken before bed, or eat some crackers and summer sausage. But he probably only has meat once or twice a week, and he's perfectly fine with that. Even when we make separate meals, his are often veg. We are both good cooks and well versed in nutrition, so there's no ""I need meat"" because everything we eat is nutritionally balanced and tasty, and I introduce new recipes often to keep things interesting. If you make sure you're hitting all the right nutritional notes in your veg dishes, I bet your SO will find he can eat that way more than twice a week! He may not even notice...  One thing that helps is colored cutting boards. We have a set that are color coded so only 2 of them are allowed for meat. That way I also never have to cross contaminate during prep. You can also have your SO cook off a whole bunch of meat at once not during a meal time, and then freeze it in portions, so when he wants to add meat to something, he just has to thaw a bag and toss it in, or microwave it. Then you are not trying to cook different things at once and making a mess. And you can pre-buy some meat options too if you need them but don't want to cook them, like pepperoni, canned meat chili, cooked chicken, etc.  P.S. Welcome to vegetarianhood! I'm glad you like it so far. I too felt like I was finally myself when I switched. 18 years later I've never gone back. :)  P.P.S. A note on gatherings and parties. When we throw a party, my friends know they are BYOM (bring your own meat). Most people don't, though, so most of our parties are 100% veg too, unless it's a barbecue. And then a meat-eater friend is assigned to the meat side of the grill. If you are not fully willing to do vegetarian for gatherings, ""bars"" work really well. Baked potato bars, burrito bars, pasta bars, personal pizzas, etc. You can cook the veggie toppings/options and your SO can make a couple meat ones, or you can buy the meat premade. This is how my work functions are done, and holidays with my in-laws, because you can accommodate vegetarians, allergies, all that by making every plate custom without a lot of mess."

Serum is relatively cheap and easy to get, however, because it's a byproduct of the meat industry, so there isn't really any funding for research to create serum alternatives, which means it doesn't get done. Unfortunately until that happens a lot of critical research will rely on serum."

It went like this:  Me: Eating meat is unnecessary for humans.  Guy 1: Are you talking on a global scale?  Me: Legitimate hunter-gatherer societies might actually need to eat meat in order to survive, which is why I'm addressing people who live in industrial nations.  Guy 2: So you're saying it's okay for some people to eat meat and not others?  Basically, he thinks being ideologically inconsistent is worse than animal abuse."

Thai and other asian restaurants are usually good about options.  As far as steak heavy restaurants, I far prefer these to fish places.  Why?  Well they usually have an off menu veggie plate which has tons of great vegetables (definitely true at Ruths Chris and similar chains) but, even besides that, they usually have the BEST sides ever and will often make a plate of 3-4 sides if you don't feel like sharing.  18 years in and my favorite nice dinner out is a steak place where we live because their sides are amazing.  Fish places I find to be the worst because they tend to put fish is just about everything.  If they have a salad (which I'm not a fan of ordering) it's usually Caesar and true Caesar either has anchovies on it or in the dressing.  Obviously some places cook their veggies in meat stock (like with greens) but a quick call ahead of time can usually clear that up. I hope I'm helping, if not clarify how I can be more helpful.

As for social occasions like barbecues and picnics, take your own veggie burgers or tofu dogs, and offer to bring the sides.  Southern style vegetables can be vegetarianized easily by replacing the traditional bacon or ham hocks with a dash of liquid smoke, or the bacon grease with vegetable oil or Crisco, and Bush's makes a vegetarian version of their baked beans that comes in a single serving can.  Also, chicken fried portabello mushroom caps are delicious enough to tempt the omnivores.

Even in my rural town, we have fast food options like Burger King (which has a veggie burger - on the ""salads"" menu), Taco Bell (where you can substitute beef for beans on every menu item), or Chipotle (where you can get a burrito/bowl with veggies and free guac or the sofritas). Aside from that a lot of places sell black bean burgers or portobello burgers. There's fallafel. There's also always pizza and pasta.   You really have a ton of options if you just know what to look for and stop looking at meat as a food option."
vegetarian,3dndt6,swrebelette,3,Sun Jul 19 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"Deep south Mississippi. Not the most ideal place... I can usually get by on a plate of ""veggies"" when eating out: Mac and cheese, beans (most beans are made with bacon or fat, so ask first before you order any beans), fried okra or eggplant... Not the healthiest choices of course, but when you're out with friends or family, it's definitely a go to. Local farmers markets are a good place to go if you have one near by, much cheaper than the store which imports most produce and costs more than average. You might have to travel out to the county to find one, but there's bound to be local farmers somewhere. Asian restaurants usually have vegetarian options and you can always find something at a Mexican restaurant. You will probably end up making most of your meals though, so make in advance and freeze things when you're tired of cooking."

Dont go vegan. Just learn new recipes and stuff like that. Make little changes like that, you do not have to do this perfectly.

vegetarian,3dk39m,ssdivot,3,Thu Jul 16 22:48:01 2015 UTC,Man I'm right here with you. I've totally cut out the eggs because I can clearly see that shit is just unconscionable but although I see the cheese is just as bad its harder for me to totally delete it. And I feel like shit for not eliminating it.  Butter and milk no  problem it is really just the cheese keeping me from being totally plant based in diet.  Damn me.
vegetarian,3dk39m,deeepseadiver,2,Fri Jul 17 06:33:44 2015 UTC,"What do you eat most often that has cheese in it?   I've always been a really healthy eater but cutting out cheese (along with other dairy) has made healthy eating even easier because I can't eat a lot of the junk food out there by default.  Vegan cheeses are improving everyday. Honestly, the only thing I sometimes miss is a good Alfredo sauce but I think that's more to do with the fact that I haven't tried to find a good recipe yet.   I like to make tacos a lot and I've found sprinkling some nutritional yeast gets the cheesy taste I want."
vegetarian,3dk39m,SixShadesOfBlack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:21:52 2015 UTC,"Well at first I was all cheese all the time, as in pizza, grilled cheese, cheese in burritos etc. But now I'm down to really my favorite recipe. It is vegetarian lasagna and is using cottage cheese and some mozzarella.  I've got rid of all the other dairy, at first I thought I'd not be able to live without sour cream etc but that wasn't a problem. I really need to check out some of these cheese replacements. I did finally try some ""fake"" chicken nuggets a couple weeks ago and was kinda amazed at how I wouldn't have known the difference if no one had told me.  I don't get into a larger town very often where they these items available so I'd really rather just learn to not want the cheese at all but dang. Ok I'm going to try to see if there is something you can use other than cheese in lasagna, like an avocado or something,maybe someone has come up with something LOL!"

If you buy your nuts (typically cashews) in bulk you wouldn't have to worry about having to pick up the ingredients from the store. :)  There are a lot of vegan lasgna recipes out there but I can't recommend any as I haven't tried them!

I still eat cheese but I've dropped milk for almond milk and ice cream for other sweets.  I recommend trying each type of milk substitute (soy, almond, cashew) one carton at a time and seeing if any of them catch your fancy.  I have found that almond milk works fine when using it as a substitute in cooking as well.     But am I really making a difference? I don't feel like it.   Of course you are!  We are all making a difference together.  Googlefu says there are ~8 million people in the United States who categorize themselves as vegetarians and this article (which is a good read btw) estimates that each vegetarian saves ~25 land animals per year.  That equates to 200 million fewer animals slaughtered per year in the US alone.  The dairy industry is the ugly wife off the beef industry so any amount of money you can prevent going into their pockets is a win for our side."

That doesn't mean we can't live off of plants. It just gave us a denser calorie source at a time when grazing on berries and fruits and nuts was the reality, and that took all day to reach our caloric needs. But with modern agriculture, we can produce enough plant foods in abundance for humans to live off of. In the developed world, there is no shortage of plant calories anymore.

If, personally, you can stomach that, then that is your decision to make. What irritates me is when people turn their nose up at killing but don't have a problem eating a steak. I'm always a little confused at their ability to draw conclusions. But I'm not someone who thinks that killing an animal for food is against it's 'rights'. I don't eat meat because of my issues with the industrial agriculture system and what that is doing to our overall environment.   I took a very interesting class in college that talked about what rights do we have in reference to other species. It was a philosophy class, so there were a lot of differing opinions. What struck me, is that if you look at the cruelty that exists in nature, do humans have any obligation to do less than that? You can argue from there, but what it really came down to is, not really. Now, everyone is allowed to their own opinions, and, frankly, I don't care why someone isn't eating meat, because it benefits me regardless. But I think there is nothing wrong with hunting for your own meat. Farming it? Eh... Probably not. Regardless of how 'humane' the farm is."

Before going veggie I was the biggest meat eater but also considered myself an animal lover (talk about cognitive dissonance).

vegetarian,3dingt,bird_person19,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:19 2015 UTC,Honestly I think people would get used to killing animals pretty quickly. The only reason consumption would decrease would be from laziness.

I don't think I or anyone else has the right to end something else's one chance at life simply for the very fleeting chance to taste it and receive some nutrients. It's different if you're another animal, whose only source of sustenance is participating in the food chain. Humans in first world civilizations have come a long way from reliance on the food chain. If there are alternatives (and everywhere in the first world there are alternatives) then killing animals to eat them is, to me, immoral. Doesn't really matter how it's done.

I was actually traumatized by living on a farm as a child as were several other veg's I know so for those of us who don't want to eat animalm products no matter how they were raised we will continue to abstain.  It's the fact that it's dead and was slaughtered and we don't want anything to do with that.  It's actually hard being vegan in an area with so mamy small farms sometimes bc I tell people "" I dont eat eggs thanks"" and then they'll try to put it on my plate anyways ""oh these are happy eggs."" ""Thanks.I don't eat those."" I get shit like that all the time. ""Oh this is organic humanely raised chicken, you eat this don't you?"" ""No."" I get that hunting is the on,y way to truly get organic and yes I 100% think every meat Eater should have to kill, clean, and gut an entire animal at least once just so they know what the process is really like.

While I believe it is better to be less removed from where one's food comes from (i.e. accepting the fact that when you eat meat you are killing a living, breathing, sentient being) I still don't think that is good enough. When someone eats meat, from any source, it is necessary that a conscious, sentient being must die, a being who was living his/her own life, yet had it forcibly ended so another organism could tear their carcass apart and devour their remains. Considering this is completely unnecessary and is based solely on one's individual choice, not necessity, I don't see it as moral."

Some say it's a full protein with lots of lysine, others say it's lacking in lysine amino acid. Any ideas? I've been eating the powder, not bothering with adding water or cooking, just needing protein while driving."

vegetarian,3dfss8,king_of_the_ayleids,0,Thu Jul 16 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"5x is completely off.  You're usually looking at about a 10/1 calorie to protein ration for eggs, and 10/1.5 or 1.8 for seitan.  Still great, but at the most it's 2x per calorie compared to eggs, not 5x."

Three days without and I start getting dumb forgetful, four days and am grumpy, six days and I start dropping stuff and tripping over whatever. Preferring to be vegan, I've looked for a replacement twenty years without success, and am now hoping seitan may serve the purpose. So as I drive long distance these next ten days, instead of a daily egg I will eat roughly a quarter of an egg's volume in dry powder seitan and see what happens. Seitan will also travel safely easier than cooking eggs while driving day after day, this route being ~8550km/5300miles.  I've never counted calories, am quite fit just generally trying to avoid empty ones, so measuring by weight (250kg seitan package = 29 eggs worth of protein) is practical, also when figuring relative cost."

Both can be present in good vegetarian or vegan diets. You could visit a licensed dietitian to help you with that. If you're a bit lax or lazy like I am, you can also easily supplement with a vitamin/mineral supplement containing iron and/or B12.   Being tired also has many other causes besides anemia. The doc can check for some of them with blood work. And sometimes you also just know that you're tired because you're too busy or you don't sleep enough (in other words: lifestyle also influences how tired you are)."

vegetarian,3dijeb,AdrianBlake,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"It would make the picture harder to understand for the doctor.  If you've got anemia, your hemoglobin levels will be low. If hemoglobin is low, the doc will look at iron levels and vitamin B12 levels. If one of them is low, then that's (very likely) the culprit.  If you're taking supplements, the doc may still see a low hemoglobin (because building hemoglobin takes some time), but for example iron levels may be low-normal. Then the question is: are they low-normal because you're taking supplements, or are they low-normal because they were never abnormal to begin with?   If at all possible, I would get the blood work done before getting supplements, in the next two weeks or so. But if you can't get the blood work done in that time frame for a reasonable price, then I guess I would start supplementing, and tell it to the doctor (""doctor, I've already taken these pills for the last two weeks, one per day, here is the bottle so you can see what's in them.""). At least that way the doc can try to estimate how much the supplements have influenced your blood work."
vegetarian,3dijeb,PumpkinMomma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"If you're anaemic it isn't from not eating meat, eating meat is just one way to cover a mild case of anaemia. If you're anaemic it's because your body isn't absorbing stuff properly.... I mean unless you literally just eat noodles or something daft.  As for the article, here is a pdf.  It really only looks at cholesterol effects of lean meat, and then goes off on a weird tangent about how humans ate meat in the past and they survived so it must be ok.   There are other disadvantages to eating a lot of meat (And a LOT is the key, meat consumption has never been as high as it is now) but that's not really the point. The point is you can eat no meat and still be perfectly healthy. The Jains are a civilization who have been Veggie since before 500BC, and they're all fine. They don't take iron tablets, they don't need special seaweed or seeds to get whatever people think we are missing. They eat normal veg, make normal foods, and it has enough in. Because shocker, we don't need meat to live. It makes as much sense to say we should all be veggie because they are alive as it does to say we should eat meat because other people ate meat."

vegetarian,3dcr3b,TheAlchemist333,10,Wed Jul 15 06:35:22 2015 UTC,"This does sound tough. Do you like beans very much? That's pretty much your best source of affordable protein. Nuts can get expensive, but peanut butter is good and you can get versions that are less sugary if you're concerned about junk food. Dried beans are cheaper but canned beans are still very cheap and fast. Two sample meals:    Chickpea curry: fry up some curry powder in oil, add spinach or other dark leafy green like kale. After a minute or two add a can of rinsed chickpeas and if you want a tablespoon or so of coconut cream. Very tasty. Mango black bean salad: Rinse up a can of black beans and toss with mango, avocado, some chili powder and lime juice.   How do you feel about flax and oats? Oatmeal and oat bran are pretty decently high in protein.  Edit: Another option for quick prepared meals to help avoid junk food is making your own veggie burger patties and then keeping them in the freezer. You can eat them on gluten free buns or treat them like burger crumbles over a salad. Here is a recipe. I can't personally vouch for it but it is highly rated. I've looked over that blog before, though, and it could be a generally good resource for you. A lot of the recipes there are gluten free and vegan. All you're missing is soy and corn free."

I basically avoided all breads (anything processed) because even though I am not allergic to gluten I am basically allergic to everything else in bread ha
vegetarian,3dcr3b,adounia,0,Wed Jul 15 14:28:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't do sugar either. If I try the vegetarian thing I will incorporate fruit but I'm gonna steer clear of table sugar.
vegetarian,3dcr3b,Voycontigo,2,Wed Jul 15 15:29:34 2015 UTC,I ate fruit and lots of stevia for sweetener. I'd like to go back to that - white sugar really messes with me

It's a perfect breakfast for me.buckwheat is somthing you can use for baking. Maybe spelt and green spelt is still an option for you too.It's an very old form of corn. I just found rice-Pasta in the store a couple of days ago.So even noodles is something you can eat.  I think it's difficult,but not impossible.Just you have to think a lot about your nutrition.

vegetarian,3dc862,anEnglishOpiumEater,3,Wed Jul 15 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"I was recently gifted ""Plenty More"" by Ottolenghi, which is full of mostly Mediterranean high-style recipes, and it's organized by cooking method, which is really unique. I can't testify to most of them because I don't usually have some of the ingredients on hand, but the recipes make me drool.  http://www.amazon.com/Plenty-More-Vibrant-Vegetable-Ottolenghi/dp/1607746212  And my #1 go-to recipe book is Mark Bittman's ""How to Cook Everything Vegetarian"", which has simple recipes as well as step by step instructions on how to make almost every style of food from scratch, including pasta, stuck pot rice, seitan, homemade bread, desserts, every type of vegetable, bean, cheese, eggs, and vegan recipes. Every time I have an idea for dinner, I generally consult the book for recommended cooking methods and times, and pairings. The book also includes food profiles, menus, substitutions, and recommendations for staples to have on hand. What I appreciate about Mark Bittman is that he is an omnivorous chef who understands that vegetarians are normal people like everyone else who like the same types of classic foods that are always good, and never panders to the cliche of a kale and hemp seed obsessed veg hippy (not that there's anything wrong with that, of course, if that's what you like).  http://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Vegetarian-Meatless/dp/0764524836  Cooking technically complicated dishes is one of my favorite things to do. I'm glad to see someone as excited as me. I had always wanted to be a chef but being a lifelong vegetarian made it relatively impossible to go to cooking school. Now I'm satisfied by impressing all of my friends and husband when I really pull something off :)"
vegetarian,3dc862,standard_candles,3,Wed Jul 15 03:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'm seconding Plenty and Plenty More (I would buy the original Plenty cookbook first).   I've made several dishes out of both - they use fairly obscure ingredients but if you live in a big city you shouldn't have much trouble finding everything. One of my favourites is the black pepper tofu from Plenty. It's hilariously rich with 10 tablespoons of butter, heaps of black pepper, and if I recall correctly it uses 2 types of soy sauce/tamari. But it's so f'ing good!The flavours are excellent in everything I've made from those books, and now that I've been using them for a few years I find the recipes easy to execute.    The Veganomicon is also good at getting some of the more complex vegetarian recipes for home made ingredients like seitan, vegetarian sausages, soy milk etc... These things are always better when you make them yourself. And it adds a bit of 'haute' to any dish if you can claim ownership over every ingredient. The sausage recipes are great because you can customize the flavours as much as you want once you get the idea down. You can also use these kinds of items in other meat-based recipes by swapping out the meat for a carefully crafted alternative.   If you are looking for plating techniques, look at any haute cuisine book and just adapt the recipes for vegetarian. A lot of fancy foods are executed well but also a lot of care goes into plating which elevates the food further."

It was a reaction to hypocrisy (or perceived hypocrisy); shutting some subs down in the name of free speech, but allowing others to remain open, presumably because she agreed with their agendas.  FWIW there was a massive hubbub when jailbait was shut down, that whole thing with /u/violentacrez for starters.  There was plenty of hate kicking around.  Not that I agree with subs like jailbait etc. but you can't get on your soapbox about censorship then not apply it equally; at least you can't if don't want people to get upset."

Not only did these new subreddits get banned but in many cases the whole modlist got shadowbanned for no apparent reason.  And later when the blackout happens she claims that the mods are upset because of poor moderation tools and not enough support - which was not even close to the truth.

Top with hot chili of your choice.  (I've used both the frozen veggie burger crumbles/TVP kind, as well as all beans.  Saucier chili is best, you want it to soak into the Fritos a bit.) Top with shredded Cheddar cheese.  (Omit if you're vegan.  The non-dairy cheese really doesn't melt right for this.) Top with finely chopped white onions. Consume with a spork.   If you want to get all fancy about it:   Place Fritos in a soup bowl. Top with chili, cheese, and onions as above. Add sliced jalapeno peppers and diced tomatoes if you like.

vegetarian,3db60y,heterosis,4,Tue Jul 14 23:41:53 2015 UTC,"Before I was a vegetarian, I confess, I was never particularly fond of meat's taste anyway. But if that's you're thing, there are plenty of great meat substitutes out there. Some of these are quite convincing and others are not, but tasty in their own way. For convincing texture and taste, I recommend Tofurky products and especially their Tempeh line. My favourite meat substitute brand is Gardein, and while their products aren't particularly authentic tasting, they have their own very enjoyable taste. Morning Star products, to me, taste like inferior Gardein products, but I know a lot of people love them.  For me, a lot of the appeal of meat comes from the fact that it's fatty, ""proteiny"", thick, and filling. It doesn't taste like I'm eating clouds and getting no sustenance. Substitute brands like Gardein, Tofurkey, and Morning Star offer that satisfying ""heaviness"" without meat and I highly recommend giving them a shot!"
vegetarian,3db60y,CosmicBadger,3,Tue Jul 14 23:19:56 2015 UTC,"When you're just starting out, there are some great, simple meat alternatives that can be found almost anywhere (even Walmart!). It's easy to find Boca Burgers, Morning Star meat alternatives, and Amy's instant meals. Right now, I have vegetarian burgers, bacon, sausages, burritos, taco crumbles, chicken-like grilling strips, and falafel mix (although, admittedly, I still prefer real cats to cat alternatives).  After getting meat alternatives, look into vegetarian recipes. Find out what you can and can't eat. Find a couple of cookbooks. Watch seitanic cooking videos. After a while, you'll get the hang of vegetarian cooking and won't need to rely on the meat alternatives."

Great for OP if they work out for them, definitely give them a shot - but don't get discouraged if they don't work out.

I admit I still eat meat from time to time if the situation is hard to avoid and I believe that this occasional consumption of meat helps me not want to throw in the towel and give up.

I didnt bother with meat alternatives at all. In the beginning it was too weird. I dedicated a weekend to get some days under my belt ans I stocked up on fresh vegetables and dips, pretzels and cheese. By Monday, I wasnt tempted by any food at work  Just find food you are excited about that doesn't have meat  Beans, corn, onions, salsa, cheese and rice are staples - good on salads, quesadillas. Good luck and I'd be happy to send recipes!"
vegetarian,3db60y,Ahedge,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"I've recently in the last 4-5 months started transitioning into being a vegetarian. I started off just trying to pick vegetarian alternatives for meals... So say I went to jimmy johns... Instead of getting the turkey Tom, I'd get a veggie sub... This was sort of a nice pressure free way of seeing what was out their beyond meaty meals...Eventually, meals turned into days at a time where I didn't eat meat. I found myself not eating meat during weekdays and eating it on weekends. Then I eventually found myself not wanting it on the weekends. I haven't eating meat in 2 months, which isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, but as of right now I'm happy with how things are going, so that's my advice. Just take it slow. You don't have to stop cold turkey. I feel like that's where people tend to give up. I know people can do it... I not saying it's not possible to stop all at once, but I just think it's easier to make major life changes if you do it in steps. This subreddit has a lot of great recipes, and YouTube is a great source for learning how to make things like tofu and whatnot! Best of luck!!! :D"
vegetarian,3db60y,Abisoccer1,2,Wed Jul 15 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of folks start off replacing meat with animal proteins intended to play the same role as meat in their food. I don't think this works. I eat these sometimes too, but they're never going to be as satisfying as meat was.  Instead, the task is to discover the unique charm of vegetable protein and to cook and eat in ways that highlight that. A good veggie burger isn't one that imitates ground beef; it's one that takes advantage of the texture of beans and grains and other ingredients. Similarly, tofu is not simply something you eat instead of meat; it's an ingredient with an elaborate history in a variety of Asian cuisines, both in vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. It's got its own role in food and there are tons of ways to cook it.  The same goes for all the beans, legumes, etc. Have you ever had a good Indian lentil curry? If not, make it a priority.  If you approach vegetarian food this way, it will hopefully feel less like, ""Here's this dissatisfying thing I'm eating instead of meat,"" and more like, ""Here's a really great vegetarian meal I'm enjoying on its own merits."""

vegetarian,3d5jpf,OmniaMors,8,Mon Jul 13 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't just that they can kill us — we genetically engineered these dogs to kill. Pit bulls make up a large majority of fatal dog attacks but less than 10% of the dog population in the US. If there were a particular model of airplane that were 20 times more likely to kill you than almost any other, people would consider that pretty dangerous as well.  I'm not suggesting anybody get rid of their animal friends or do anything mean to pit bulls just because we made them good at killing — they aren't machines, and they can love and be loved just like any other dog. But I don't think we're doing anyone favors to overstate our case when the numbers clearly show that, while most pit bulls are nice and well-mannered, the breed's capability for viciousness is much greater than any other."
vegetarian,3d5jpf,PaintItPurple,3,Mon Jul 13 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"The main problem with pit bulls isn't that they have a genetic disposition for viciousness, it's that when they bite, they can do more damage than many other breeds because they have very powerful jaws.  That's why they're involved in the most fatal bites.  (Followed by other big, strong dogs like Rottweillers, German Shepherds. and Chows.)  I believe that the #1 breed for biting in general is the chihuahua, followed by cocker spaniels and poodles.  But those dogs seldom, if ever, cause serious injury."
vegetarian,3d5jpf,DkPhoenix,3,Tue Jul 14 00:16:59 2015 UTC,"To say they are ""genetically engineered"" to kill is an unhelpful hyperbole. They have been bred to kill animals, sometimes including other dogs, but not humans, as have many other hunting breeds. Pit bulls are also by far the most abused type of dog, which is probably related to the high incidence of fatal bites. Additionally, the vast majority of fatal dog bites are caused by unneutered animals, indicating a probable lack of responsible ownership.  Consider this infographic for more."
vegetarian,3d5jpf,surlier,-4,Tue Jul 14 03:11:56 2015 UTC,That's horrible logic.  Black people (a breed of human) also commits a disproportionately large percentage of violent crime. So are black people also just naturally violent?  It's a circular self fulfilling prophecy. People think pitbulls are violent. So violent people buy pitbulls. So pitbulls are poorly trained. So people think pitbulls are violent.  Pitbulls are not genetically predisposed to violence any more than any other dog.

Not ""what your brain looks like when you give up meat"". It also still does not explain why OP would be feeling the way (s)he is after giving up meat.  Logically what would make more sense is that the gut flora is changing up. And/or the intestines are changing up the speed of ingestion based off of higher quantities of fiber.  Do you know why you can get addicted to certain habits such as gambling? It isn't because of the act of gambling itself. It's because of what gambling does to your brain. It sets off dopamine receptors and you get addicted to that rush of pleasure running through you as your brain lights up from excitement.   Perhaps to some degree dopamine or serotonin or any number of neural chemicals might be going off when one is around meat. Maybe that's a reason it's hard to give up meat! But realistically, it's going to happen because of changes in the intestines.  It's pertinent not to make baseless speculation, which the change in neuro pathways and so forth is.

Animal products tend to be calorie dense, as in they contain more calories per gram than most fruits and vegetables.  Try adding some healthy snacks to your daily routine, like nuts or nuts mixed with dried fruit (or even nuts and chocolate chips).  Drink a glass or two of fortified almond/soy/rice/coconut milk (whichever variety you prefer) every day.

After going to the beach with friends one Sunday, and admittedly after a few beers, we all went to a seafood restaurant. I've sworn off seafood  for about 6 years now, have been a vegetarian otherwise for about 10. But there was something about watching my friends all eat these baked clams that made me want to try one. Ok I thought, they're bottom dwellers, they don't have brains, they don't have hearts, if there's anything I can feel less guilty about eating its these stupid clams. So I tried one, and honestly, it was so delicious. But for like a week afterward I had these awful feelings of guilt, like I had somehow betrayed someone (myself) and I was really truly genuinely upset about it. I think that's really what it comes down to, feeling just upset about going back on your own morals and principles.

It took me quite a while to stop feeling like I was being disobedient by eating or buying meat. I had to retrain my brain to classify it as a food again, if that makes sense.  Also I returned to allowing meat in my diet bevause my initial reason for going vegetarian was based in an eating disorder, and I feel like letting go of the comfort-zone feeling having dietary ""rules"" gave me was a crucial part of my recovery.

vegetarian,3d69mn,Lynac,4,Mon Jul 13 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"Really the only thing that's changed is people like to ask me a million questions when we eat together but the actual eating part isn't difficult for me. by the way, what you are doing now, eating 3-4 no meat meals a week already has a huge impact. There are a lot of people who eat vegetarian at home etc. But will eat meat at restaurants or parties or whatever. This is still really good and has a big impact, I think it's better to do this for the long term then to go vegetarian for a month and then give up if they think it's too difficult.  as for meat cravings, I usually just eat something salty (dont know why that works)  as for life changes, I've discovered new foods I never would have heard of if I wasnt vegan. My plate looks much more colorful. I've met other amazing animal activists and have gotten involved with a couple different organizations . My body feels 100% better. My pms and cramps have significantly decreased (especially when I gave up dairy too). I have more energy, and my skin is clearer.  Sometimes I feel like I'm being a nuisances or a burden to my friends whend we eat out. I have the fortune of living in an area with vegetarian restaurants so my friends are always will ing to compromise but I'm surprised at how accommodating they can be. I've had ppl tell me ""I've never cooked for a vegetarian before! How exciting!"" Which is a huge relief because st the other end of that spectrum are peopl who are REALLY not excited to accommodate a vegetarian and I have to be respectful of that. If I speak clearly and non confrontationally about my choices it usually winds up okay"
vegetarian,3d69mn,Elliotrosemary,4,Mon Jul 13 23:57:08 2015 UTC,"For me, it was an easy switch at first. I started out by just not eating things that I knew had meat in them. I spent time on Veggit and other veg*n websites. Then I started to learn about the hidden animal products. I started to read labels and avoid things like gelatin and lard and beef/chicken broth. The important thing is to never stop learning. I was probably a vegetarian (or thought I was, depending on how you look at it) for a whole year before I learned what rennet was and that it is found in most cheeses even if it isn't specifically stated on the label.  I had meat cravings for the first two weeks. After that, I just lost interest in meat. I started to be put off by the smell of it within a couple months.  How much it changes your life depends on what/who is around you. External challenges were the only hard part for me. I made the switch when I was living with my parents in Mississippi. Living with people who weren't supportive made it a challenge. Another challenge was that my options at most restaurants were limited. The only time I absolutely couldn't find anything to eat was when I was taken to a restaurant in Memphis that specialized in frying catfish. Apart from that, I was able to eat anywhere. I even ate at Outback Steakhouse once (although I did have to order a grilled chicken salad without chicken). For the first week or so after I made the switch, I felt pretty bad. I was only eating salad and hard-boiled eggs, so I wasn't getting the nutrition I needed. I did more research into vegetarian diets and improved how I was eating. Once I found out how to eat right, I felt much better than I did when I was eating meat. I got down to a more healthy weight. I had more energy for things like marching and cycling. My mood was better at first, though that bit sort of wore off after a while.  TL;DR   The transition was easy once I put a little effort into it. I didn't crave meat for long. Most places will serve vegetarian food, but you may have to order creatively (i.e. a chicken-less chicken salad). If you are in a place that isn't accepting of vegetarians, it can be challenging. I noticed positive changes in my health once I switched."
vegetarian,3d69mn,HowCanYouBuyTheSky,4,Tue Jul 14 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"My experience was that it's easier than it feels at first, and in fact my food became more varied and interesting when I stopped just going for meat as a default savory ingredient.  I deal with meat cravings (specifically for lamb-over-rice street cart food) by learning how to cook a vegetarian analogue.    The funniest thing that happened so far was that I became convinced that I had all manner of incredibly unlikely vitamin deficiencies, but realistically meatless complete nutrition isn't a huge challenge."

vegetarian,3d69mn,AU___NATUREL,3,Mon Jul 13 23:52:10 2015 UTC,"Most functions have a vegetarian option or an option that can easily be made vegetarian. I’m vegan and I’m rarely ever in a situation where I can’t eat anything at the place. The options might be minimal, but I still eat.  If you have reason to believe that there will be absolutely no vegetarian option at a function, treat is as if the function has no food whatsoever. This might mean eating just before, or taking a break in the middle to go munch on some snacks in the car.  Your best bet is to call ahead whenever possible to see if you can be accommodated. If it’s a restaurant let them know you’ll be with a big party. When you get there, try to pull aside the server in private, or just mention it when ordering. Even the most steakhouse of steakhouses can at least do a pasta dish or a salad of some sort."

The most annoying part is when people try to get all up in your business. The food part is amazing once you get the hang of cooking differently (plants can do some pretty amazing things!) I only had cravings for the first 1-3 months or so, and only when I was really hungry and other people were eating around me. I think it depends on how strong your motivations are. Advice: eat up those beans! They're high protein, filling, and healthy."
vegetarian,3d69mn,bird_person19,2,Mon Jul 13 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"I went vegan about five years ago from meat-eating. I didn't really have a lot of cravings for meat. I had cravings for certain flavors, but none that I couldn't replicate since those flavors were mostly about what seasonings I put on meat before that. Or sometimes I just wanted something salty, or sweet, or savory, and that's pretty easy to figure out.   When I have to attend events, I bring my own stuff usually, even if it's just a few ClifBars or something similar. If it's a potluck-style dinner, I bring enough stuff to share, but make sure I have enough reserved for myself. As more people found out I was vegan, I did have more and more options, but I never count on others catering to me that way. And eating some stuff beforehand is also a good idea so that you don't feel so hungry. But if you have to go a few hours without eating, so what? Barring some specific health issue, you will be fine till later.   Life changes and yet it doesn't. Personally, I have had some great health changes since going vegan (especially cutting out dairy). That was unexpected but awesome. Granted, plenty of people are healthy before and healthy after and so don't experience a great change. I do feel like I've had a lot better food since going vegan. It's less convenient at times, but it did get me out of my rut of just eating whatever I was used to. Eating seems a bit more intentional now. There is also the peace of mind of knowing that I'm putting my ethics into practice when it comes to animal exploitation and the environment. But I still live a pretty normal life and I'm not some weird ascetic or anything."

Once I'd gotten the hang of a couple of dishes, I was starting to love the feeling of cooking for myself, but it was tough growing up in a family of all meat eaters. I caved a couple of times in the earlier days; the first was a week into my vegetarianism. It was a chicken sandwich that I bit into, forgetting that I no longer did that. My main cravings are doner kebabs, battered cod & KFC. There are a hell of a lot of good substitutes though. Linda McCartney's range of products has gotten me through some rough meatless days, but 3 years on I don't feel the need anymore. It has essentially been totally dismissed by my mind, I don't even register it anymore if someone offers me chicken or something. In regard to occasions, there will generally be something to eat other than meat dishes, but as monsus said, they can be underwhelming some of the time, as vegetable dishes aren't the focal platter for most people. It's very much mind over matter, if you want to stay away from it enough, you can do it.

It cut out a whole section or two of the grocery store I had to wander through, and eventually those sections started to gross me out more.  I ate a lot of processed, frozen, and canned shit.  I never was much of a cook but all I was used to was meat-based, so I scrambled my way through a few years before I had some experience working in a kitchen and learned skills I could use to feed myself like a grown man.

But I swear I'm not the one ever bringing it up. It's always somebody else asking ME why I don't eat meat, or him noticing and saying something.    But yes... I am looking for data that I can use to both clarify my own positions and to give him every time he brings it up (I have zero expectations that he'll ever change his mind about ANYTHING - I once got in a fight with him because I said that 'Sushi' referred to the rice and he said it was the 'fish' and even when I showed him 5 sources, including my Japanese-speaking friend, he still wasn't going to change his mind...

If you don't have animals defecating on land and enriching the soil, the land, which evolved in conjunction with animals, doesn't yield what it should.  Wheat and corn farming degrade the land.  They are unsustainable crops.  We need to grow crops which do not harm the land and we need to not have monocultures (large fields with single crops), which damage the land and spread & create diseases.   When agriculture fields replace natural vegetation, topsoil is exposed and can dry out. The diversity and quantity of microorganisms that help to keep the soil fertile can decrease, and nutrients may wash out. Soil can be blown away by the winds or washed away by rains.   https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/soil-erosion-and-degradation  If you can't grow food on certain pieces of land without ruining the soil, there aren't many alternatives."

vegetarian,3d5g80,bird_person19,2,Thu Jul 16 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"Ok so I finally got around to making it, and I think it was mostly a success. I followed the guide I posted before, using cashew milk.    Bring 2 cups cashew milk to a light boil Add 1/4 tsp soy lecithin, whisk, and bring to a boil again  Remove from heat and wait until the milk drops to below 110 degrees F, but not below 100 degrees F Add a pinch of sugar and 2 tbsp starter yogurt (I used an almond cashew yogurt from whole foods)  -mix together and keep at around 100 degrees fahrenheit for 8-9 hours   The hardest part was trying to make sure it didn't get too hot or too cold. I don't think my oven was cool enough. I kept it in there for the first hour but then moved it to the cupboard above my fridge and left it there overnight. The end result tasted pretty good. It was fairly thick and creamy, but didn't taste much like the original yogurt so I'm a little worried that I killed the culture. I'd recommend getting a yogurt maker to have a bit more control over the temperature."

The cultures thrive at not much over body temperature (~108 F) so I mix the culture into the soy milk in a pot and put it in the oven. Then I turn it on until it gets to 110 F and shut it off right away. A few hours later it's done. If you let it culture too long it gets watery, so you want to do it on a day when you'll be around to put it in the fridge when it gets to the sweet spot.  No, it's not as thick as greek yogurt. I've added agar to it, but that came out way too rubbery. I mostly use it in smoothies or turn it into tzatziki.  Culturing's fun and kind of a hobby for me. I also make cashew based cheese with rejuvelac that is awesome."

vegetarian,3d5kim,datTrapezius,5,Mon Jul 13 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"I stick to whole foods and the more color the better. If I am making something simple I try to always add more veggies - so if I'm eating Mac and cheese or spaghetti I add peas and spinach and zucchini or something.  For breakfast I like tofu scrambles with beans and onions and peppers - I make a big batch for the week and then just grab a bit every morning. For lunch and dinner I usually make 2 meals (this week is sweet potatoes with black beans and tomato and ginger broccoli with seitan) I find if I try to eat something different every day I waste a ton of food and end up with not enough time to actually cook.  I would grab the Forks Over Knives cookbook - really simple and heathy recipes if you need inspiration.  Also, get your blood tested if you feel ""off."" You could have an iron or vitamin deficiency - I take B and D supplements because I find I am naturally low on them and its harder to get without eating meat. When I forget for a few days my energy and concentration levels naturally drop."
vegetarian,3d5kim,jammbin,5,Mon Jul 13 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"Here's what I usually do! Breakfast:   Smoothie: frozen fruit blended with watermelon and topped with flax and chia seeds   Milkshake: frozen bananas blended with peanut butter, almond milk (or soy for higher protein) and either cocoa powder or vanilla  Oatmeal: oats soaked in almond milk overnight or cooked in water, cinnamon, lots of fruit, seeds/chopped nuts, and a touch of maple syrup   Chia pudding: chia seeds soaked in almond/coconut milk to give a pudding-like texture, topped with lots of fresh fruit (mango's my favourite)   Breakfast wrap: lots of beans and hash browns with quinoa, salsa, avocado, and spices.   Lunch:  Sandwich: yve's bologna or salami with lots of crisp lettuce, tomato, avocado, and a touch of mustard.   Or I have leftovers   Dinner: This one's different all the time.  Often I combine legumes (or tofu), whole grains, and veggies in some sort of sauce, like guacamole, sesame sauce, peanut sauce, tomato sauce, teriyaki sauce.  Snacks: nuts, seeds, veggies and hummus, fruit, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, apples and almond butter, etc   Mushrooms and sea vegetables are my favourite foods right now. They're so healthy and fun to experiment with. I always make sure to drink a fortified almond milk for vitamin B12, and vitamin D in the winter."
vegetarian,3d5kim,bird_person19,3,Mon Jul 13 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"I eat bran flakes almost every morning for breakfast, and I always put at least one kind of fruit in the bowl (strawberries and bananas, usually). Coffee and tea are also both staples. In the wintertime, I switch from bran flakes to porridge.  I track what I eat via MyFitnessPal, but I often don't hit all my nutrient goals because I'm eating a low-calorie diet. Some things I find really difficult (iron, for example), other things I kind of know what I can add to hit my goals. I do use protein shakes when I exercise... I kind of like them, anyway. I would have a smoothie out of choice, so adding the powder doesn't change much for me.  I find it hard to eat the same thing every day for lunches and dinners, but making sure there's enough fruit and veg in my diet means I do a variety of salads, grain salads, curries, etc. I like to prepare food in advance and have it ready in the fridge or freezer, but I still need to mix it up to feel satisfied.   If you're worried about nutrition, try a calorie tracker. Even if you aren't trying to lose weight, it will help you to look at your nutrition goals and track what you might low on. You can then try adding extra good foods into your diet, taking a vitamin or supplement, or checking with a doctor to make sure everything is good if you're worried."

No dressing, just lemon juice, s&p.  Dinner: varies the most.  I like to make a baked potato, quinoa, pasta, or some type of sandwich.  Snacks: I eat nuts, berries, and veggies whenever I feel like it.  Hummus is great,too.  Vitamins:  I take a multi vitamin when I remember, maybe twice a week.  I feel fine without them."

Breakfast: I use this recipe for oatmeal pancakes. I add two tablespoons of peanut butter, 2 tablespoons of chia seeds, and a few dashes of cinnamon. Chop up whatever fruit I have on hand and throw it on top. Bananas are good, so are tangerines or peaches.   Lunch & dinner: I pick up a selection of veggies and pair them with a starch, be it brown rice, whatever asian noodles I found interesting at the market, or some sort of beans.   I cook everything once a week and then just pretty much eat leftovers. I also work at a restaurant so I can usually get a couple free meals a week to up the variety."

vegetarian,3d2fr6,Kingcrowing,0,Mon Jul 13 13:31:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but they actually are if you look at cost per calorie as compared to processed food. If you want 2,000 calories of fresh fruit and vegetables (and even more so if you try and eat local & organic), and you look at the cost of 2,000 calories of processed snack food, you'll realize how comparatively expensive they are.   Just for example, a normal 15.5oz bag of Doritos can be had for $1.99 on sale pretty regularly, at 140 calories per 1oz serving, that's 770 calories. To get that many calories from carrots you'd need to buy 31 ""medium"" (61g) carrots, and I don't know where you could get that many for anywhere near $2.  The fact of the matter is processed food for the average American is so crazy cheap that it has made fresh produce comparatively expensive.

vegetarian,3d2fr6,Kingcrowing,2,Mon Jul 13 14:07:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. But that being said, you still need some number of calories to sustain yourself each day, and if all you care about is cost, then fresh fruit and vegetables are not going to be the cheapest route.   In my opinion your health is the greatest asset anyone has, so spending money on good quality healthy food is the best thing any of us can do (vegetarian or otherwise), so if you just think about cost you're never going to be as healthy as possible. That being said though, if you can be smart and aren't afraid to cook you can eat exceptionally well without breaking the bank!"
vegetarian,3d2fr6,jay76,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'm always surprised when people say that fresh produce is an expensive option. I don't live in the US, so I'm guessing we aren't being exposed to the cheap calorie-rich foods you mention, which is in turn shaping my perception of what ""cheap"" means.  A person on a budget here would be silly to buy processed foods vs things like rice, beans, frozen vegies and cheap vegies like potatoes, pumpkin, carrots etc. I'd consider other options expensive, even factoring in the calorie load.  Also, being vegetarian I don't factor in the cost of meat, which would add quite a bit to my weekly food bill I suppose. Cheaper sources of food might seem more appealing if i was after a meat fix."
vegetarian,3d2fr6,Kingcrowing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"You're right it isn't that they're absolutely expensive, it's that they're relatively expensive compared to the cheap processed crap we have everywhere in America. You can get  cheese burger, a chicken sandwich, fries and a coke for $5 at McDonalds...  Since the only pre-made food I generally buy is bread and pasta, it's not really even a concern for me personally, but Americans spend less of their budget on food than any other country, and we eat more calories than just about any country all while spending about the least amount of time preparing our food."

vegetarian,3d2fr6,brickandtree,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:48:29 2015 UTC,Remember too that many fresh vegetables (and fruits) can be frozen before they go bad to save them for longer. Like if you have some fresh broccoli or squash and you only used half of it and now the rest is getting in the way of your other cooking urges or seeming like it might start going soft. Just chop it up quick into big pieces and toss it in a plastic bag or reusable container and put it in your freezer. They are easy to pull out later for a stir fry or to enhance a soup or stew or other dish especially if you thought you were out of vegetables. And frozen berries or slices of melon make great summer treats or can go in your iced summer drinks too.

Lentils, hemp seeds, quinoa, flax/chia/sunflower/pumpkin seeds, soy milk, nutritional yeast, black beans, chick peas, tofu, tempeh, seitan, peanuts, wheat germ/oat bran and almonds/nuts all have quite a bit of protein. Mushrooms, sea vegetables, and sprouted beans/seeds are fairly high protein vegetables.   The easiest thing to do for meals is probably mix a legume with a whole grain, and combine with mushrooms/veggies and seasonings. So for example a good meal would be quinoa and lentils with salsa, avocado, nutritional yeast, and hot sauce, or black beans and brown rice with guacamole, onions and garlic. In addition you can snack on nuts and seeds throughout the day, and maybe throw in some tofu here and there.  I love making bean balls as a high protein snack. I just knead together whatever I have on hand, which could include beans, lentils, hemp seeds, flax seeds, TVP or tempeh, diced mushrooms, onions, garlic, and spices, and a bit of vital wheat gluten. Add a touch of veggie broth or sauce if it's too dry. Then roll them into small spheres and stick them in the oven until they're meatball-y."
vegetarian,3d5h1x,bird_person19,2,Mon Jul 13 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna back everyone up in this thread - it is totally a misconception that people don't get enough protein from vegetarian diets. A normal person only needs 40 - 50 grams per day.  Weight training as a vegetarian can be a little tricky, though. Here's some rough math (my SO is a dietitian). Weighing 93kg and being an athlete, your body could probably use between 135-180 grams of protein per day. That's not easy to come by, regardless of whether you eat meat. Your body can really only process about 20 grams of protein at a time, so you need to spread it out throughout the day. Eating a protein shake an hour or two after a meal is a good way to pack an extra 60 grams into your day. You'll also need to go out of your way to eat high-protein vegetarian foods with your meals (eggs, other dairy, quinoa, greek yogurt, nuts, seitan, etc.).  In short, for someone who lifts 3-4 times per week and plays sports, you probably weren't getting as much protein as you could use when you were eating meat, unless you were consciously doing so or have someone to make you a meal plan on a college sports team. My advice: add the protein shakes in for sure, but make sure that you're getting a lot of veggie protein sources from the meals that you eat as well. You don't have to get up to the numbers above in order to stay healthy by any means, but they will help you maximize your gains.  Hope that helps, and glad you're not eating animals any longer!"

I think there is nothing wrong supplementing your diet with protein powders. But that's all they should be. A supplement. Majority of your protein should be food. If you want to put on real size get used to eating some tofu and wheat gluten. Some processed fake meat should also help get your protein numbers up too but try to limit it because gains are nice and all but you want to be healthy too. But hey that's up to you. Check out vegan fitness sub too.   Edit: I eat 2000-2200 calories. I can get around 160 -180g of protein on a cut. I'm 230lbs. I've never seriously lifted before but I'm going to start. But I dont care about putting on a lot of size.
vegetarian,3d5lvs,Slushij,4,Mon Jul 13 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Since peas and rice aren't complete on their own when it comes to biological value, I wanted to find a blend but I had no luck so far.    The idea that you have to combine protein sources to make a ""complete"" protein is an outdated nutrition myth. So long as you get enough lysine, you're just about guaranteed to get enough of the other essential amino acids. Legumes like peas are high sources of lysine (though not the only ones). They are lower in methionine than grains, but that may actually be beneficial. The old values were based on the amino acid ratios of an egg being the ""perfect"" protein standard but now we know that that's not the case.   Protein powder isn't a replacement for good nutrition built around more whole foods, and a lot of people who use it probably are at no risk of actual protein deficiency anyhow, but if you want to use it then a simple pea protein should be fine as is without combining it further."

I wish I could give you something more specific, but I just dump chia seeds in some plant milk, let it set, and eat.   You can make homemade hemp milk really easy, too, fyi and that also adds good omega-3s and protein. Just hemp seeds and water blended together. Much easier than nut milks since you don't need a high power blender or a strainer. Add sweetener as desired.   I need to make more variety of chia puddings. A friend brought some over that had some pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice in it. She served them with Biscoff cookies. That was absolutely decadent.   I have made it with more like a tea than a nut milk, too, in which case it's more like jelly, I guess. I used it with hibiscus tea and sweetened it with stevia. That was pretty good, actually."

Since it's not practical to keep pastured birds safe from all predators (at least I can't think of any way but if you know how to, I know a lot of people who would love having that knowledge so please share), I would be willing to bet that they lose a decent percentage of their birds to predators."

Out of curiosity, where do you live? My parents and their neighbours all have the same problem where they can lose multiple chickens a day if they let them be free range. That makes it pretty necessary that they keep them in a covered run or the neighbors just lock the chickens in a coop all day since they can't afford having a run like my parents. Even with that, raccoons and coyotes will still manage to dig their way in or find out how to open latches. This is all in the foothills of NC so it's definitely possible you live in an area with less predators. I've also heard that if you keep roosters with the chickens, they are much larger and more aggressive so they do a better job and keeping predators away. Not sure if you do that or not but my parents say they are uncomfortable eating possible fertilized eggs so they don't (it's weird to me that they are comfortable killing and eating the roosters just so they don't accidentally kill and eat an embryo but that's their opinion)."

Freegans and freeganism are often seen as part of a wider anti-consumerist ideology, and freegans often employ a range of alternative living strategies based on limited participation in the conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources.  The word ""freegan"" is a coinage derived from ""free"" and ""vegan"".  Freeganism started in the mid-1990s, out of the antiglobalization and environmentalist movements. The movement also has elements of Diggers, an anarchist street theater group based in Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco in the 1960s, that gave away rescued food.

I buy soy milk instead of cows'; I eat eggs only from my mother-in-law's chooks; if there's a vegan option at a cafe', I'll take it over the vego option; I still use cheese and sour cream when I cook.

Ya know, something that is actually relevant to life."

You see where everything is in relation to other organs. It is like using a globe vs. using a map. The experience is important and I don't understand why people wish to remove the practice. I do agree however that we should also be taking apart motors and computers. Obviously a 3D ""rat"" would be better as it does not require killing an animal but they should definitely keep dissections."

And that knowledge is extremely unimportant for 99% of students so who cares if you only get the book version? The computer version was much better at showing where everything actually was than books or dissection anyway.  Besides, look, the value of a globe is that it sits there in the classroom so it can be used as a reference whenever a student feels like it.  The dead baby pig guts?  Even if I had been able to make any sense of them I would have forgotten a day later unless I hacked up another pig.    Scientific experimentation on animals is sometimes necessary.  High school students performing amateur autopsies on them does not qualify."

Entirely removing the practice would hurt many students with an interest in biology. I know for many people in my class it was an interesting, and exciting even, experience and by eliminating the practice we are depriving them of this great opportunity. Also I do not agree that the online dissection is on par with real dissections. When you are seeing the inside the animal you are getting an entirely unique experience. You are feeling how stiff the bones are, the texture of the small intestine, the thickness and strength of the tiny heart, that while being so small is strong enough to supply blood to the entire body. To experience this kind of learning you need to use your hands a computer screen can not suffice."

For some people seeing the internal workings of an organism first hand is the spark that gets them curious enough in the field that they pursue it into a career which can lead to actual contributions. For the most part our education system is about providing a baseline of information in as wide of a range as possible so our kids will become well rounded and have knowledge of many things. Also dissection is a very very common activity in a lot of fields and it's important to teach technique and how to work with different tissues and how to properly cut them, which can be useful in situations outside of academia. Like if you get stranded on an island/in the mountains. Or if you get your arm caught in a rock and have to cut it off, knowing what a nerve looks like vs just muscle can help you decide on how to cut it off. Sure it's not useful for 99% of people but like I said neither is algebra or calculus, or art, or history. Hell we could probably make the argument that the only really useful class is english and that's only useful up to the point of teaching people how to read/write. And with that being said every school gives the option to sit out on dissections to students, in fact at many schools it's opt-in now."

vegetarian,3cxg5t,furiousxgeorge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point being more that it can teach a useful skill, it's just that most teachers don't even know how to teach it correctly. When taught correctly it can provide valuable skills. I also thought that a lot of the specimens came from natural deaths, although I could be wrong about that. Realistically they could just show a video of someone doing it but there is the whole hands on lab thing that science likes to do for everything. I can see the point in chemistry, but poorly instructed autopsies isn't exactly that useful in most scenarios. There are certainly schools and students that would find a value from it, but that speaks more to the disparity in our school system than whether or not dissection is useful."

Have you been okay with soy? Are leafy green vegetables okay (those don't bother mine at all, raw or cooked)?   Also, can you have pickled vegetables? Some people with OIS can, some cannot."
vegetarian,3cz6v3,Cerealcomma,2,Sun Jul 12 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"I am allergic to several kinds of fruit myself.  Avoiding fruit shouldn't be a problem for you at all.  Peanuts and tree nuts could be a little more of an issue, since you find oils and other derivatives from them in some prepared meat substitutes.  Is your allergy so severe that you have to avoid products that may be cross-contaminated?  Or are you fine with small amounts, or nut products that have been cooked and processed?  There's such a range of foods that can substitute for meat in cooking that a rundown would be at least a novella.  Basically, you've got those things which require more preparation by you (Tofu, tempeh, seitan, and the various concoctions using chickpeas, beans, lentils, jackfruit, etc.) and the commercially prepared meat analogues (Veggie burgers, ground ""hamburger meat"", chickenless strips, etc.).  All of it is totally dependent on your personal taste.  Just as a quick, general guide, Boca and Quorn brand veggie burgers have the reputation of being more ""meaty"" in texture than other brands, which may or may not appeal to you.  Quorn and Gardein brand ""chicken"" strips, patties, and nuggets get good reviews, and anything that comes already highly flavored, like veggie breakfast sausage, bacon, pepperoni, etc, is usually pretty close in flavor to the carnivorous versions.  The veggie burger crumbles are pretty darn versatile, and are almost indistinguishable from ground beef in most dishes.  If you have questions about a specific product or type of meat substitute, ask, and someone here will be happy to give you their opinions."

I wouldn't worry about malnutrition unless you start showing symptoms of malnutrition.

Instead of snacking on nuts and fruit, you could snack on seeds like pumpkin, sunflower, flax, or chia, and eat vegetables with hummus.   As for meat substitutes, my favourite brand is Gardein. They make really good black bean burgers, crispy ""chicken"" tenders, and fishless fillets. I've also heard good things about field roast products, but we don't have many of them in my country.

Most of the time, the food you'd be feeding them is terrible nutritionally, like bread, and can end up making them sick. Bread can be exceptionally bad because uneaten pieces become moldy and cause disease outbreaks.   Anytime you're feeding a wild animal, you're decreasing its natural abilities and increasing its reliance on humans. There's reasons why most parks and other places have signs asking you to not feed the animals. It doesn't take much for an animal to be comfortable with people, and although you might treat it with kindness, the next person it approaches may not.   Your intentions are great and it's awesome to try and keep having good experiences with wildlife though! I'f you're looking for something relaxing and easy to do, I'd consider birdwatching!"

vegetarian,3cza3w,KerSan,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"To address your question directly, you can indeed get some vegan lures (in a purely material sense, not in their ethical worldview sense). Most vegans would say (and I agree) that the lure probably still wouldn't be vegan because of how you're using it if you hook them.  That aside, there are tons of lures that you can get that aren't live bait or cut bait. Try spoons, spinners, artificial worms, and a whole host of flies that you can use. I don't know of any baits that are specifically vegan though. It would be hard to get most species of fish to bite on plant matter like that (unless it mimicked the smell/taste of something they like). They make peanut butter punch bait for catfish, but I think it's still cheese based.   If you don't want to hook them at all, and just want the show, you can take the hook off of a spoon or other lure and dangle the hookless spoon around in near-shore rocks. Panfish like the green sunfish will strike out of instinct, so you'll get a nice look at it as it darts up, ""kisses your lure"", and then darts back into its hole.  If you're in a boat you could possibly cut the curve of a carp fly's hook off (so it can't hook it) and try to get him to gobble it (thus giving you a good look) before he spits it out. You may also notice that a lot of fish will follow patterned lures, spinners, etc out of instinct, so that's a good fish watching technique (keep it near-surface so you can see)."

A recent report by the Zoological Society of London, in concert with WWF International,8 claims that in the past 40 years 52% of all the world's wildlife has disappeared, with agriculture, urban development, and food energy production identified as the major threats.      Overall, diets with a high share of animal products (including meat and dairy products and eggs) can lead to overweight and obesity, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, gout, and cancer. Additionally, the consumption of meat from intensive livestock farming (more than 99%) results in antibiotic resistance and in the intake of pharmaceutical residues and stress hormones. Many scientific studies show that vegan and vegetarian diets not only contribute preventively to a healthy and longer life but also have a curative impact on many diseases.43 Tilman and Clark17 (p. 3) summarize dietary comparisons between meat eating and non-meat eating. They conclude that switching to a non-meat diet can lead to a reduction in type 2 diabetes from 16 to 41%; in cancer from 7 to 13%; in coronary heart disease from 20 to 21%; and in overall illness from 0 to 18%."

vegetarian,3crm4c,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:43:16 2015 UTC,"Section 19. Animal welfare of article  Dairy farming:       The practice of dairy production in a factory farm environment has been criticized by animal welfare activists.   Some of the ethical complaints regarding dairy production cited include how often the dairy cattle must remain pregnant, the separation of calves from their mothers, how dairy cattle are housed and environmental concerns regarding dairy production.  The production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation, followed by a ""dry"" period of about two months of forty-five to fifty days, before calving which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frames can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.  Dairy operations therefore include both the production of milk and the production of calves. Bull calves are either castrated and raised as steers for beef production or veal.  An important part of the dairy industry is the removal of the calves off the mother’s milk after the three days of needed colostrum,  allowing for the collection of the milk produced. In order for this to take place, the calves are fed milk replacer, a substitute for the whole milk produced by the cow.  Milk replacer is generally a powder, which comes in large bags, and is added to precise amounts of water, and then fed to the calf via bucket or bottle.

They could do yes, they have no motivation to do so. Why would you? What are you going to do with all those animals that are now worthless to you but still cost you money to live?   RESULTS: Results showed a significant time effect for biceps brachii muscle thickness (P < 0.0001). Thickness increased from 24.9 ± 3.8 mm to 26.9 ± 4.1 mm and 27.3 ± 4.4 mm at D0, D42 and D84, respectively, with only a trend toward significant differences between groups (P = 0.09). Performing a sensitivity study on the weakest participants (with regards to strength at inclusion), thickness increases were significantly different between groups (+20.2 ± 12.3%, +15.6 ± 13.5% and +8.6 ± 7.3% for Pea, Whey and Placebo, respectively; P < 0.05). Increases in thickness were significantly greater in the Pea group as compared to Placebo whereas there was no difference between Whey and the two other conditions. Muscle strength also increased with time with no statistical difference between groups.  CONCLUSIONS: In addition to an appropriate training, the supplementation with pea protein promoted a greater increase of muscle thickness as compared to Placebo and especially for people starting or returning to a muscular strengthening. Since no difference was obtained between the two protein groups, vegetable pea proteins could be used as an alternative to Whey-based dietary products.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628520"

There may be some very small scale operations that practice this,  but people who buy dairy are supporting a very different reality.   Defending the ""good ones"" often edges into an overall defense of animal exploitation and people will point to these very small,  isolated farms as if they tell us something meaningful about how cows are treated by dairy farmers.   It's hard for me to imagine a farming community that has lots of farmers that care about animal rights.  Do you mind sharing what part of the world you live in? How do these farmers oppose  their neighbors that do practice culling and slaughtering? Are they vegan except for the dairy produced by the cows in their care? Are there tensions in the community?"

The Human Slaughter Act does not extend to non-mammals, including chicken and fish. The EFSA Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare [PDF] concluded in 2004 that:   Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time. For some species, existing methods, whilst capable of killing fish humanely, are not doing so because operators don’t have the knowledge to evaluate them.   I have seen no indication that anything has seriously improved in the last ten years.  As for your suggestion that it is good for ""humanely raised"" cows and ""free range"" chickens to be killed, I honestly can't understand how you arrive at the conclusion that killing an innocent animal in the prime of its life is in any sense ""good"" for the animal."

Green take a little longer, but have more substance to them.  Both of these are super cheap; lentils are usually the cheapest protein source per gram available. Perfect for students. Browse around the internet and you'll be able to find a ton of recipes  Edited to add that I was incorrect - you'll find all the essential AAs in a lot of pulses and legumes.

Cabbage similarly works on tacos. Or boil up a green cabbage (super cheap, so my household does it once a week) with some salt and pepper or a red cabbage with some apples and ACV.  There are a wealth of dishes that involve lentils and rice. Toss in some Labneh (yogurt cheese) if you like.   Polenta is also pretty versatile. Just add in what you like.

Take a basic risotto and you can mix in what you like.   We also get seasonal veggies that we'll often cook/roast up and include where it makes sense.

Or in Brittany where it is seafood, same for the south. You just need to adapt I suppose.  My family in law had never met a vegetarian before and they are very accommodating. My mother-in-law actually has found a veggie shop in their small town, which surprised her! Vegetarianism is growing in France and is no longer seen as weird. I think you just got unlucky with the people you ate with :( . French people are very proud of their cuisine so it is seen as rude to refuse to eat something. Even though, you stated you were a vegetarian, so it does seem kind of a faux pas on their part.  There are shops like 'Naturalia' or 'Bio C Bon' which have a very wide selection of veggie products and are not at all uncommon. Even when going out to eat, if there is no vegetarian dish on the menu, I just ask them for a vegetarian option and there have never been any problems."

Yes there are occasional options, but most salads have dead animals in them, and a main course is almost always either fish or meat. I've always been able to ask for special treatment however, and the people of Lille are so friendly they sometimes even make your meal free because all you ate was vegetables.

And we also stayed fairly close to the conference area (Grand Palais).  Pretty much every place we went to had something full of cheese or plain salad as the only veggie main. One place had 'vegetarian burger' on the menu, but it contained salmon. The fast food places (e.g. Burger King and Quick) had no veggie option.  Literally none of the restaurants mark vegetarian options on the menu, and most of them don't have English translation, so that made it just a little worse.  I finally went to the first 'veggie-friendly' place mentioned on Happy Cow today. There were two options on the menu. Neither were great.  Anyway, maybe I've been unlucky so far.

I know when I was in Europe (with the exception of Italy), if I wanted to have a vegetarian entree, it would have to be something American-ish like a veggie burger, or otherwise non-traditional and disconnected from the country's culinary tradition.  Whereas in the US, every restaurant is going to have at least one veggie option that's in keeping with the theme and quality of the other entrees."
vegetarian,3cjpg7,Kingcrowing,5,Thu Jul 9 02:52:06 2015 UTC,"That's really a matter of preference. Personally I don't think French food is that great. Perhaps you are confusing French fine dining and French food? Day to day the French eat rather basic things: boiled eggs, pastries, bread, and of course they do have lovely cheeses. French fine dining isn't something that's eaten everyday. Just like Americans don't go around eating apple pie everyday, the Scots don't eat haggis all the time, and Australians don't eat BBQ for every meal."
vegetarian,3cjpg7,jesst,3,Thu Jul 9 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"French people on average eat much better than Americans, yes even day to day.

vegetarian,3cjpg7,Kingcrowing,3,Thu Jul 9 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"The same can be said about all European countries when compared to America. I live in the UK and while we probably eat more processed foods then the French we certainly eat less then Americans. We get weekly deliveries of fresh organic veggies, milk, and eggs from local farms.   My parents live in America and my husband and I are always shocked at how crap we feel when we come home. We have issues with going to the toilet while we're there and we sleep horribly. We can't wait to get home and eat a normal home cooked meal."

I'm lucky to live in one of the healthiest cities in the country with the biggest co-op and one of the biggest farmers markets in the country (along with a handful of veg/vegan only restaurants to boot!), but I've traveled a lot in the US and it's a rarity sadly... but I think people are learning, slowly."

Pizza is a good option if you're going with meat-eating friends.  There's a really big price range in pizza, and you can go to some really nice gourmet places.  For a cheaper meal, go to those places that either advertise doner or super American food.  They typically have falafel and Pakistani food, depending on the proprietors.  Basque country was harder, because while there are vegetarian pintxos, they're not nearly as good.  But the other commenter said they were successful, so...  I had one difficult meal in Lisbon, but the rest of the time I got along fine on soup, pasta, and pizza.  And PASTRIES."

In Japan it's all fish and meat - no sides of vegetables, and of course no cheese.  Luckily the 7/11's in Japan have packaged salads, and vegetables to take-out, but they are expensive.

vegetarian,3clmbp,yodase99,2,Sun Jul 12 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not religious but I find this very interesting.  If religious text is any kind of basis for these decisions there are plenty that promote meat, it's pretty open to interpretation: ""When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised you, and you say, ‘I will eat meat,’ because you crave meat, you may eat meat whenever you desire.""    ""These are the living things that you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth. Whatever parts the hoof and is cloven-footed and chews the cud, among the animals, you may eat.""  ""Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you."" Etc etc.    Personally I think if Christians believe in striving to emulate Jesus' behaviour, at the very minimum things like factory farming should be obviously abhorrent. I get the feeling that the bible promotes attitudes of dominion over animals and nature, and a certain sense of entitlement for special little humankind, which gives rise to certain really harmful, greedy behaviour.    But with verses like ""And the angel of the Lord said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you because your way is perverse before me."" surely even very pro-meat Christians should oppose cruel farming practices.   And on the other end of the spectrum from things like ""Rise, Peter, kill, and eat"", we've got stuff like: ""And I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts. For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity."

I am not Christian, but I write (and think about this) as though it's all true. I have no idea whether it is or not, but in this situation I just assume it is."
vegetarian,3clmbp,yodase99,2,Sun Jul 12 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"Vegetarian Christian here. I am not of the opinion that the bible teaches vegetarianism/veganism. My perception is that the original food for humans were indeed plants and fruits. After the fall into sin, the humans started eating animals which was not the original purpose of animals. Nonetheless God let them do it because he exposed humans to their sinful nature. Now I also don't say that eating animals is a sin. But it was not the original purpose of them to be eaten by humans.   However God wished animals as a sacrifice for the sins of Isreal.    10 Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering for the generations to come. It is most holy to the Lord.”    Exodus 30:10 (NIV)  But Jesus was then the ulimate sacrifice for our sins.  Interesting verses are also:   14 I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. [...] 23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.   Romans 14:14+23 (NIV)  So it's ultimately up to you again. What does your conscience tell you as a Christian? It can be both, you may eat or not eat animals. If eating animals would burden your conscience, then doing so would be sin. But if you don't have any hard feelings, you are free to do so.   So I abstain from eating animals because I couldn't handle the guilty feeling of killing an animal for my food. Additionally I am of the opinion that the way we treat animals in the food industry (mass food production, very bad conditions for animals, etc.) is not how God has meant it.  Well, that was my Christian answer, my opinion naturally will differ from the ones of other (vegetarian) Christians. :)  There are also other interesting verses to this topic in Romans 14, I would recommend any Christian and Non-Christian which are interested to read it. :)"
vegetarian,3clmbp,RagingMayo,2,Sun Jul 12 16:51:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting anwser, thank you.  This is also a thing for every individual to decide, but you could try to live the way God would have wanted it in the world before there was sin. Meaning that you shouldn't be ashamed, and also shouldn't eat animals.  But as I've said, that's all a individual's decision to make.  Also: why would God want someone to sacrifice another being? What's your view on that?"
vegetarian,3clmbp,yodase99,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"It's my pleasure. Regarding your question - I could try. So all of mankind fell into sin. God naturally didn't like sin, because it meant ignoring what he meant for us. The connection between God and us was broken. So God thought that this had to be fixed. He made this rule that there has to flow blood for forgiveness. I think He wanted to show how significant and extreme the consequence of sin is which is eternal death itself.     This annual atonement must be made with the blood of the atoning sin offering for the generations to come.""   (Part of Exodus 30:10)   23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.    Romans 6:23 (NIV)  The animal itself was innocent, but only blood of an innocent being could satisfy the wrath of God. In a way, the animal died in our place, however the annual sacrifice of animals wasn't a permanent solution. No man or woman could be safed by following the commandments which He gave Moses. So God (in His unending love for us!) has sent His son Jesus so that He may be the ultimate innocent sacrifice. Only his death could really satisfy the wrath and at the same time build a connection between us and Him.   3 For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,   Romans 8:3 (NIV)  So, luckily, we no longer have to sacrifice animals or whatever for receiving forgiveness, but it is all already ""paid"" by Jesus (yay) and we can have eternal life by asking for forgiveness and loving God (= faith).

A few years ago I was the kinda guy to eat a lot of meat (and few vegetables), even several kinds in the same meal. Once I became increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the meat industry, I made a conscious effort to bring down my meat eating, starting with a few veg days a week.   As time went by I ate meat increasingly seldom, and after a while I found that I didn't really enjoy it anymore, and only really ate it at work when the veg option wasn't to my liking.  Especially beef and pork  tasted weird, and even meats I had previously loved, like serrano ham or charcoal grilled steaks became mediocre or downright dislikable. I realised you only like meat because you're used to it.  As for the weight thing, I can't really relate, but I'll give you these general tips: Eat fat and fibre + drink water and you'll stay full forlonger, and don't eat anything within a couple hours before going to sleep.

A lot of the vegan people who like to argue ethics on this subreddit will probably have some of their arguments for you, and I see from their responses that you've already seen them, so I won't go into the details of those.  If you're not grossed out by touching meat, and you don't care (and managed to get a job at a young age) then go for it! People will always find some reason to say that what you're doing is wrong (your shoes aren't vegan - therefore you are literally hitler), so you should really just try to focus on what you think is right. You indirectly help create demand for meat by working there, but depending on your moral system that may or may not matter, since you aren't directly culpable for the production/consumption of that meat (someone else will do it). Even if you stopped, you'll be poorer and the average cow on a factory farm won't know the difference.  Whether you do catch and release or not, fish aren't all that developed. There are a few shaky papers/blogs/abolitionist sources floating around saying that we should care (and they're probably right on the pain front), but ultimately it's up to you. If you feel bad about harvesting them, most fish can be fairly quickly immobilized and rendered essentially dead with a forceful insertion of your fillet knife into their head at the right spot and forward of said spot (usually on the top of the fish just behind their eyes or equal with them). I notice no reaction to external stimuli after they've been killed in such a way. Just don't miss - they may struggle when you go to open their belly and you might cut yourself (and are being cruel by cutting into a live fish). It helps to ice 'em before you spear their brain, since they'll be partially dormant due to the temperature.  There are no clear benefits to pescatarianism over vegetarianism - you can have a balanced diet on either end of the spectrum. In the end, there are a ton of different views here, and a lot of people's jimmies get rustled if an animal so much as gets constipation on a farm. If you can cut out some meat products, and try to make choices that are good for you and the environment, you're doing better than a lot of people. And that's a good thing.  TL;DR: Live your own life and make your own choices. People here have a variety of backgrounds, and everyone makes compromises (even those sacred vegans) and employs cognitive dissonance to make their choices seem like the logical conclusion. So, just do what you think is right and it'll probably all work out."

vegetarian,3clkri,TheIronMark,2,Thu Jul 9 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"Well, your reasons for considering a pescetarian diet are health and environment, correct? So the issue is whether working in a butcher shop would be in line with those values or not.   As for your health, there isn't a huge difference between working at a butcher shop and working in other jobs that someone your age would have access to. Sure, you work with customers, who are gross and carry disease, and you handle money, and there are knives, but there will be such risks anywhere you work.   As for the environment, meat is pretty awful for it. However, you know better than I do how the meat from your butcher shop is sourced. If it's something you can be proud of - or at least, not ashamed of - then go for it.  It's also important to remember that you're a teenager trying to work a summer/after school job. You're not going to be working in a lab synthesizing a cure for cancer; your options - unless you are incredibly lucky - are pretty much retail, food service, and camp counselor. At your point in life, a job is where you make money to spend on movie tickets and ice cream, not a career you devote yourself to. I wouldn't sweat it too much.   As for the ethics of catching fish to eat, I have no issue with it. I get that fish are sentient beings - I am pretty familiar with them and care for several as pets - but it does not bother me to kill them for food. I don't, because I don't like how they taste and I think it's too much work to actually go out and fish them, but if it's your thing then go for it."

Cows, chickens, pigs, fish - they are all living creatures and as such should all be treated with respect. One life is not more important than another (ex: cow red meat vs fish meat).

If you want to stop supporting factory farming, you may want to consider cutting out eggs and dairy as well as only eating the fish you catch.    I never intended to go vegan, but over time I got more and more used to eating plant-based meals and preferring the taste. I went from eating fish a few times per week, to a few times per month, to only eating sushi every once in a while and never having it in the house. At the same time I was eating it less and less frequently I started to think more about how fish must feel while 'drowning' in air.     I absolutely do see an ethical distinction between hunting/fishing yourself versus consuming factory-farmed meat, dairy, and eggs. To me, it's basically the difference between shooting an animal in the head and torturing it for months before killing it. After a while I became uncomfortable with the killing at all.    The only reason I think this post is being criticized so much is because you essentially asked whether killing is ethical on a vegetarian sub. What would you expect?

If you're the only one who is a vegetarian going, I suggest you get involved in the meal planning and don't rely on the other people going to guess what you can and can't eat. You really can't fault other people for not bringing food for you to eat if you're not a part of the process.   As far as food for you to bring is concerned, anything that doesn't need to be refrigerated is fair game. I camp several times a month during the summer and I never understand why people eat such crazy food camping. Canned foods, TVP, macaroni & cheese, spaghetti, falafel, fresh fruits and vegetables and anything else that you normally eat that doesn't need refrigeration are all fine. If you're bringing a cooler, bring tofu or whatever other proteins you normally eat. Like I said, I'll never get why people punish themselves with eating nuts and berries while they're camping.

vegetarian,3ci8w4,saucercrab,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"I think this thread goes to show that for many people, ethical vegetarianism can extend beyond diet. Wikipedia agrees. As does Google.   I've also seen many semantic discussions revolving around the use of the word ""vegan"" to describe people who couldn't care less about ethics and simply maintaining a plant-based diet. (I agree that veganism is more than a diet, but it goes to show that the definitions of each word are in flux, as far as a societal-definition is concerned.)  So you can make arguments this way or that, but to lay down ""facts,"" claiming literally this or literally that is ""simply false."""
vegetarian,3ci8w4,SolomonKull,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"Ethical vegetarianism is a philosophy that dictates your actions, but not a diet that dictates your philosophy.  Being a vegetarian for ethical reasons has literally nothing to do with the fact that vegetarianism is strictly a diet.  The links you posted don't say what you think they do, and I believe you misunderstood what you read.  Wikipedia:    Vegetarianism /ˈvɛdʒətɛəriənɪzəm/ is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.   Literally nothing to do with ethical reasoning for the choice of diet until this part:   Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, along with animal rights. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic or economic.   Notice that it says these are ethical reasons for being a vegetarian, but it doesn't say or even suggest that vegetarianism is anything more than a diet.  It simply says that these are common reasons why somebody might choose to eat a vegetarian diet.   I've also seen many semantic discussions revolving around the use of the word ""vegan"" to describe people who couldn't care less about ethics and simply maintaining a plant-based diet.   Those people are literally not vegans. Veganism is an ethical philosophy that includes strict, non-diary, non-ovo-lacto-vegetarianism. Vegans must be ethical to be vegans, otherwise they are just strict vegetarians.  There's a huge difference between these terms, and it would seem you don't understand that difference.   Let's take a look at Google's definition:   a person who does not eat meat, and sometimes other animal products, especially for moral, religious, or health reasons.   Let's start at the beginning... ""a person who does not eat meat, and sometimes other animal products"".  This is vegetarianism.  This is the definition of vegetarianism.  The second half of this sentence ""especially for moral, religious, or health reasons"" is explaining the causes for the vegetarianism, and are not requisites for vegetarianism.  This is very basic, simple stuff to comprehend, and I don't know why you're trying to twist the definition to include things that it does not include.     So you can make arguments this way or that, but to lay down ""facts,"" claiming literally this or literally that is ""simply false.""   You're wrong. You're allowed to be wrong, that's your right, but know that you are, in fact, wrong.  It's not an argument of semantics.  It's an argument of fact, and the fact is that vegetarianism doesn't include an inherent moral or ethical philosophy, because it's diet and only a diet. Anything else you tack onto that definition is not ""vegetarianism"", it's vegetarianism+something else."
vegetarian,3ci8w4,saucercrab,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"What exactly am I ""wrong"" about? This is semantics - and just like other subjective arguments, there really is no black and white.    and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.   I interpret this to mean within one's lifestyle as well as consumption. For example, leather or fur. I'm sorry that you apparently think I'm mentally challenged for looking at things in a different light. Gasp! Someone has a different opinion than me! But the reason I mentioned the varying definitions of veganism is because I've been on the other side of THAT argument as well. (I did mention - as you seemed to overlook - that I do completely agree that being vegan is more than just a diet.) Because, like it or not, there are probably thousands of people who consider themselves or recognize the term ""vegan"" as pertaining to diet and diet alone. I.E., vegan athletes, vegan bodybuilders, vegan celebrities, vegan health nuts, vegan anorexics. I guess they're all wrong as well, huh? You're the self-appointed king of vocabulary? A dynamic, every-evolving form of congruent communication? (It is actually pretty ironic I'm having this conversation, as I've been involved in many arguments over the definition of the word ""literally,"" a word that you seem quite fond of.)  Just because it says ""may"" doesn't mean that one cannot live a ""vegetarian lifestyle."" That's not for you to decide. Can I not identify as a vegetarian when I'm not in the act of eating? Am I not allowed to speak up for animals or choose not to support the circus because I'm adhering to a diet and nothing more? Is a Christian not actually a Christian when they are not within the doors of a church, or reading the Bible? With such logic, do you feel that homosexuals can only identify as gay when they're actively having intercourse?  Look, the definition of both words vary, but the simple fact that people within this sub, within this thread, and myself included have decided to eat a vegetarian diet AND ""abstain from the by-products of animal slaughter"" for ethical reasons means that it is more than a diet. It IS part of who I am. I have a ""vegetarian lifestyle"" in that I make conscious choices to lessen my impact on the planet, on the animals, and on my health. I speak up for animals when I feel it's appropriate, I have designed clothing pertaining to animal advocacy and I ran a fucking vegan catering business for three years. Vegetarianism is more than a diet to me. Period. You might not agree, dictionary.com might not agree, but it's not your choice - it's mine.  And here's the kicker...  In trying to shove my error down my throat you have placed your foot firmly within your own mouth. (Is that vegan?)   Anything else you tack onto that definition is not ""vegetarianism"", it's vegetarianism+something else.   The very suffix of -ism denotes a philosophy or ideology. The same could be said for -ian. So the words ""vegetarian"" and ""vegetarianism"" are more than just a diet, according the to rules of the language we communicate with, in much the same way that ""veganism"" is more than just being an herbivore and being a Christian (should) mean more than simply attending church.  /Throws down mic.  Now I know where this will go, as conversations with most vegans eventually do:   1.) I am a hypocrite for claiming an ethical lifestyle while eating cheese and/or eggs.  2.) I cannot make ethical arguments while still supporting animal exploitation.   Even though this is a HUGE, unending argument (that I will not have right now) I live my life the best that I can and in the best way that I choose. We are all hypocrites, we are all pieces of shit. But something is better than nothing, and - in my eyes - eating a little cheese is no different than shopping at a store that profits from meat, eating a restaurant that profits from meat, supporting unsustainable energy, purchasing vegetables grown on different continents, etc. Just because the choices I make might not seem as important as those that other people make, does not mean I am not trying and certainly does not negate the effort that I do put forth."

That word's definition was to include all non-ovo-lacto-vegetarians, ie; strict vegetarianism who follow an ethical ideology that is defined by the Vegan Society.  People who call themselves vegans but do not adhere to the ethical philosophy as layed out by the Vegan Society are literally not vegans.  Don Watson defined veganism, and literally 100% of the people who do not follow that definition of veganism are not vegans. Strict vegetarianism is not veganism. Strict vegetarianism is vegetarianism. Vegetarians are not inherently vegans, but vegans are inherently vegetarians. This is simple.

Ethics aside, imo leather is just fucking gross and barbaric. It's 2015 and we're still skinning animals and wearing them. WTF.    Concerning ethics, however, what REALLY blows my mind is that, by and large, leather is NOT a ""byproduct"" of the meat industry, as I thought it was for many years. The vast majority of leather (and obviously, fur) is sourced from completely separate animals, who are raised exclusively for their hides. The chemicals used to treat and tan are atrociously destructive to human health and the environment, and the entire business model is just as exploitative of poor people as factory-level slaughtering. The only time I've come close to ""needing"" leather is while shopping for some good hiking boots. Luckily, you can find just about anything online these days...  I also try to avoid products tested on animals, but it falls a bit more in line with my lazy consumption of cheese and eggs. For example, I name-brand toothpaste because it's easier to find, more affordable, and more effective than a brand like Tom's."

vegetarian,3cfos9,IndigoBlue14,10,Tue Jul 7 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Low calorie density, high fiber, high water content foods. You feel fuller longer and eat less as a result. There's also the interestingly low rates of de novo lipogenesis from carbohydrate sources which plays a role as well."

The only food that really doesn't leave you feeling full for long is high sugar food and breads. Meat is satiating for a long time as are eggs on a keto diet. I was doing IF on keto and it was super easy to just completely forget about eating some days. So I don't think it's 100% that. With that being said after going from keto to vegetarian (after going from 335 to 185ish) I dropped another 10lbs and went down 2-3 belt holes which I had been stuck at for a while. I'm also getting back into eating more carbs and not feeling as guilty about it. But yeah it's an interesting transition. I'm still not always sure what to make I default to throwing a bunch of vegetables in a pot with a bunch of beans and maybe some avacados, or a salad with a bunch of vegetables, or tofu + vegetables."
vegetarian,3cfos9,itguyy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to acknowledge that fasting as well as ketosis are physiologically abnormal situations. You're telling me outside of ketogenic intermittent fasting, you regularly felt sated after eating a couple chicken thighs or a portion of ribs <500 calories? I also ketod my way down from 315 to 215 a long long time ago, so I know the difference between being stuffed in ketosis and normal life meat and egg consumption."

I was probably eating like 6k calories a day, most of those calories from breads and sugary shit that didn't fill me up, when I ate meat I was good for a few hours. I would say that in general proteins, good fats, and slow carbs are filling. I can't compare my old diet to my keto dieting because the breads really really throw off my ability to feel full and largely still do. It's like they fill me up super fast then deplete super fast and that leaves you hungry. But yeah 500 calories from a chicken salad and I would be great for hours. Sometimes I'd only eat like 500 calories in a day if I was just gaming and not doing anything (I still do close to that anyway)."
vegetarian,3cfos9,itguyy,3,Wed Jul 15 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"But they are also quite filling, at least meat and eggs. So if you eat whenever you are hungry until you are not hungry, they might help you lose weight cause you need less food and less often. You could eat the same amount of calories in bread for example, but I think that leaves you more hungry. Not sure, but just to point out that caloriedensity is not the only factor, the other is how much you eat.  And I thought that nuts are quite high in calories?"
vegetarian,3cfos9,Arthellia,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Every diet ever is just calorie control under a different name; there are biological mechanisms that can enhance or retard the process but at the end of the day calorie control is the the massively dominant factor. What makes this funny is that low carb diets like Atkins and keto often pride themselves on advertising to potential dieters how they can lose weight whilst eating a shedload of meat, because it's low in carbohydrates, so you get all this bacon circlejerking and whatnot. But they always advise that you still have to keep a caloric deficit. So basically all they're doing is a normal caloric deficit diet but in a fairly unhealthy manner. (Yes ketosis has been shown to speed up the process but it's a pretty weak effect in comparison to calorie deficit). It's nice to see a study that exposes these diets as the gimmicky nonsense that they are."

Once you find all the premade junk vegan food you're right back where you started, anyway.  I'm really not a fan of touting a plant-based diet as a weight-loss diet because it implies that it's a miracle diet, and if it doesn't ""work"" then people get really upset at the diet and by extension the whole movement. Plus I'm a strong advocate of animal welfare, and treating it as a diet says nothing about the animals. The latter point, however, I realize is a personal hang-up and really I should be happy that people want to explore a plant-based diet, no matter where they're coming from (especially given that I didn't initially try  vegetarianism because of the animals, so I'm not really one to talk haha)."
vegetarian,3cfos9,purple_potatoes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the point.  People can lose weight on anything, even ultra high fat, low carb /r/keto and /r/vegetarianketo diets.  I think it really comes down to the percentage of healthy vs. processed food  (and yes I think high fat foods can be healthy and I also think high carb foods can be healthy) that your body can handle, which I very much believes changes as people age.  I can eat the same amount as when I was 15 years younger.  That's not the case as for many of my friends.  If you make it from scratch, there's a good chance it's healthy.  If it's premade at the store, there's a good chance it's not."
vegetarian,3cfos9,billsil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:07:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's calories in vs calories out for weight. For general health you're probably right, as long as you continue to keep in mind calorie amounts. It's very possible to overeat healthy food."
vegetarian,3cfos9,purple_potatoes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's calories in vs calories out for weight.   I agree, but there are foods that make you hungrier than others (e.g. refined carbs).  I'm 32 and manage my weight just fine and I haven't counted calories a day in my life.  That's not the case for many people.   It's very possible to overeat healthy food.   Yes, you certainly can, but then you can find you aren't hungry for a day.  The body's pretty good at telling many people when they've had enough.  To gain 1 pound per year or 10 pounds per decade (roughly the average), you need to overeat ~9.5 calories per day.  9.5 calories on say 2500 calories (I'm a guy) is eating 0.38% more than they need (100.38%), which is an A in my book.  That's better than the best calorie counter in the world can do.  I'm ~2 pounds lighter than I was 15 years ago, so that means I'm short 1.27 calories per day on average or 99.95% of my target.  I'm not even that accurate by willpower.  I gorge and then I might not eat for a day or two.  tldr; Calories matter, but counting them probably doesn't."

I've lost most of that weight, but all that is to say that there are a lot of bad choices you can make as a vegetarian or vegan. Pasta and carbs are a delicious replacement for meat but much easier to pack on pounds. Pizza with diaya and tofurkey sausage is still vegan. So is spaghetti and ""meat""balls. Mac and ""cheese"", too.   It's also easier to make healthy decisions, but you have to be aware of what you're eating."
vegetarian,3cfos9,Cornelius_Rooster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"While I totally agree that it's easy to be an unhealthy vegan, not all carbs and processed foods automatically cause weight gain.

vegetarian,3cfos9,madjoy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"Finding one or two delicious options for dinner that aren't high cal is all well and good, but you know how many calories are in it, meaning you're monitoring your intake. Simply switching to being vegetarian isn't a magic weight-loss plan. It still takes measuring and monitoring your intake. A lot of vegetarians I know replaced meat (protein) with carbs like pasta and bread. Sure, more veggies, too, but a significant increase in carbs and calories will indeed cause you to gain weight."

Therefore every time a riled up vegetarian shares this ad indignantly (like OP has just done) all they're really doing is helping to push the ad out to Arby's actual target market who get an easy chuckle and an eye full of bacon.

vegetarian,3cdo65,MadeUpInOhio,6,Tue Jul 7 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"I was, for a few years, what I termed a ""weak willed vegan."" What I meant by that, was that if I was choosing what to buy or prepare it would be vegan. I was, of course, strictly vegetarian. I did this because my eyes had finally been opened to just how horrible the egg and dairy industries actually are- before that, I whimsically thought that dairy cows and egg laying hens had basically decent lives. The only times I would eat egg or dairy were in social situations or at restaurants where there was an ova-lacto vegetarian option but not really a vegan option.  The thing I eventually found was that my egg and dairy eating became so infrequent that my body, just like it has with animal flesh, responded very uncomfortably when I did eat them. It got to be just like with meat in that I could no longer view egg or dairy items as food. It wasn't an abrupt or difficult transition. I didn't immediately just go vegan one day and I can't point to a ""veganniversary"" like some people can.  So, I guess what I'm saying is, maybe try cutting back on egg and dairy where you can. Once you start doing that maybe you'll find that you enjoy cutting down even more on suffering. You may even end up like I have where you don't miss eggs or dairy at all and are glad that you finally gave them up.  Anyway, thanks for doing what you can and sorry about my long winded reply."
vegetarian,3cdo65,tonedeath,2,Tue Jul 7 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think in my case, and in a lot of ours, cutting out eggs is easy enough, there are alternatives to milk, but find it difficult to ditch cheese.    Cheese is still my bane."
vegetarian,3cdo65,slappymcnutface,2,Tue Jul 7 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"Cheese is still my bane.   And now I'm picturing the Laughing Cow with a bane mask on.  Anyways, I'd recommend just making a lot of recipes without cheese for about two to three weeks. When those cheese cravings hit hard, try using hummus as a replacement (I'd recommend making it versus buying it; cheaper and tastier). As Frumpiii stated, there's also a lot of good vegan-friendly cheeses out there.  Chao gets a lot of good reviews from some of the other vegans I've talked to. Daiya can be hit or miss for people. It's a miss in my book. Follow Your Heart also gets a lot of good reviews. Go Veggie sometimes gets good reviews too, but they've got a fair amount that are lactose-free but not dairy-free, so just watch out with them."

vegetarian,3cdo65,Frumpiii,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. I actually spent 2 years as a pretty strict vegan but I lived in a college town with few vegan options on campus, etc. I emded up going back to dairy. That was over ten years ago, I guess. But I am lucky that people in my neighborhood raise chickens so I've been able to buy eggs from friemds at least some of the time."

vegetarian,3cgio5,missingmarkerlids,11,Tue Jul 7 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Talk to him about it. If it's important to you (and your kids), he would hopefully understand. You could make simpler meals for him (like a helping of chicken on the side), and focus your effort on the vegetarian portion of the meal. Most people eat way too much meat in a meal anyways, so making the meat an afterthought rather than the focus of the meal makes sense.  It would seem really strange to me that a grown man would be so picky that he would complain about eating his veggies!"
vegetarian,3cgio5,Engi_Queer,5,Tue Jul 7 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"(like a helping of chicken on the side),   Maybe get like a rotisserie chicken from the store?

vegetarian,3cgio5,sunny_bell,5,Wed Jul 8 00:29:35 2015 UTC,I work at subway and my god you would be stunned how many grown ass adults just want turkey and lettuce on bread. It's even worse with kids. Probably over half of them get plain sandwiches. I always congratulate the ones who get more than just lettuce so that hopefully they grow up still liking veggies.
vegetarian,3cgio5,PhAnToM444,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:32:01 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised. I was on holidays with my friends (pre-vegetarian days) and while they ate their burgers/chicken etc. most of them didn't eat the salads. Two of them despise vegetables.

vegetarian,3cgio5,breakplans,4,Wed Jul 8 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"The trick is not to emphasize plain veggies and legumes in a dish, but sneak them in under lots of sauces and spices. I was never really a big veggie fan until I went vegan and learned to incorporate them into meals much more creatively. I find the taste for meaty things like ribs and steak fades pretty quickly after eating more plant-based for a while, so maybe you could ask your husband to do a trial period of your dinners for a week or two and see if anything changes? Good transitioning meals include spaghetti and bean balls, burritos, chillies, curries, and stews.   This pasta sauce is really good:  http://eatwithinyourmeans.com/vegetable-bolognese/  And here's one of my favourite veggie burger recipes:   http://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-burger/#_a5y_p=3257721  Both these recipes are packed with veggies but you can't really tell!   For the record, my heavy-meat-eating SO decided to go fully vegetarian after a few weeks of me cooking him tasty, satisfying plant-based meals.   Good luck!"
vegetarian,3cgio5,bird_person19,3,Thu Jul 9 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"I would consider myself a fairly adept vegetarian cook. I've made all kinds of things which have loads of flavour. This week I'm making burritos, sushi, omlettes, and thyme scented white bean cassoulet. And he won't eat any of it :( aside from a plain cheese omlette. I made a delicious tomato lentil pasta stew and black bean curry that all the kids love and he won't touch it. I get not being adventurous enough for something like southwest spaghetti squash... but he even picks out the beans from my minestrone!"
vegetarian,3cgio5,sunny_bell,5,Thu Jul 9 13:21:56 2015 UTC,Your husband sounds like my ex (we did not break up over this).  If he is that picky he can put on his big boy panties and cook his own meat (that's what worked for me and my ex).
vegetarian,3cgio5,bird_person19,2,Tue Jul 7 20:00:39 2015 UTC,"Hah, he sounds exactly like my dad. He's always going on about how he should cut back on meat for health reasons, but claims it's ""too hard"" (even though I always offer to cook him food!). He doesn't like anything to do with legumes or vegetables. The only think I've made so far that he's really enjoyed has been the stuffing, mashed potatoes, and gravy that I made for Easter dinner. There have been some pasta attempts that he was ok with too. He sneers at fake meats but I bet if I snuck some in a chilli he wouldn't even notice!"

vegetarian,3cgio5,guaca_molly,2,Tue Jul 7 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not. No kids yet. But one thing I like to do is make a meal that can be easily divided into meat and meatless at a certain point in the preparations. For example......Shepard pie. I make the veggies (mashed potatoes, carrots, peas, and corn). Then the only thing separate is the protein. So the real pain in the ass is the dishes because you have one meat pan, one meatless protein (whatever you use, tofu, tvp, already prepared ""meatless crumbles"") and then you also have one baking dish each. BUT, the prep is the same except for the protein. You can also do this with pretty much any pasta dish. Pasta + sauce+meatballs+veggie balls. Make it so half of the meal is something you both will eat. Sandwiches are a good example too."

vegetarian,3cgio5,PM_ME_UR_TARANTULA,3,Wed Jul 8 01:34:41 2015 UTC,"I don't mind cooking meat for people but I just don't trust myself to do it right. What you should do is make items such as burritos, pastas, etc and buy precooked meat from a local deli or Mexican restaurant (you can buy the meat alone) and put it in at the last minute. That way you have the same meal and everyone can eat it!  Edit: What's with the downvotes? Seems like a good idea to me."

vegetarian,3cgio5,wlkngcntrdctn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"My household is an nontraditional where my daughter, my mom, and I live together instead of the ""normal"" family unit. That said, I'm the only full time vegetarian in my house and I also don't mind cooking meat for my family (or friends) whenever they want me to. Maybe it has to do with me loving to cook (?) However, since I've been a vegetarian for a couple of years now, both my mom and daughter have pretty much switched their diets to plant-based. Neither of them eat meat more than 3-5 X's/ month. So, whenever my daughter does ask me to cook her a meal with meat, I don't mind because my reason for not eating meat is health related (I can't process animal protein). Since I've always liked to cook, she has several meat-filled meals that she misses--that's why I cook meat with no hesitation when she asks.   I'll admit, there's a bit more to it than that. I just made sushi for my bf and daughter last week (I don't like sushi at all) because it was his birthday. I do like to bring pleasure to my family (and friends) through food and I do love to learn how to cook different things from scratch. I cooked fried rice for myself. They liked it, and he appreciated it. I don't mind having to do it 3-7 X's/month, but I'm not sure if I could keep it up every single meal just because of the preparation it takes since I cook every single thing from scratch--that's my fault, however."
vegetarian,3cjaw7,sanchit_khera,6,Wed Jul 8 10:26:09 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you about microorganisms   Vegetarians and vegans don't eat animals, not we don't eat life at all. Also the issue isn't death, the issue is us raising animals to kill for food. Animals that never get to experience nature at all. Not anything outside of human nature, that is.  The fact is virtually all other species on this planet do not breed other creatures in captivity, by the hundreds of millions to billions, to feed people. Other species do not create arbitrary lines in different cultures that says ""let's eat cows, but not dogs"" or ""let's eat chickens, but not cows"".  Also as for the ""we should kill ourselves"" line, the better option would be trying to convince others to be vegetarian/vegan too. It is more impactful than a bullet to the brain and gets around that pesky ""fear of death"" about 99.99999% of us have. It's incredibly ridiculous to suggest that's what should be done to be moralistic. You'd have far more impact on the world convincing two people to go vegetarian/vegan than to simply remove one mouth to feed (yours).  Nutrients can easily be gotten through commercial means. That nice thing called technology that is letting us communicate also allows us to easily produce B12 via bacteria colonies. Don't give me that ""but you have to supplement"" line, because the animals we'd be eating are getting B12 supplemented too. Why? Because we wash our crops and our animals are being fed cheap grains instead of soil-covered grass. We also live in societies; they're not the wild. We don't need to worry about living off the land since most of us aren't living off the land.  If tigers didn't eat deer, the deer would overpopulate? Why can't we leave that job to the lions, tigers, and bears, oh my? Also if the deer start eating up all the vegetation, the does are going to eventually lose their ability to ovulate/ovulation will slow down, which is going to result in them being unable to repopulate. It's a natural, built-in birth control. Isn't it amazing how these issues can be worked around naturally, since life isn't a perfect vacuum? Most deer overpopulation issues are the result of man-caused deforestation and hunting practices that kill off the fittest male deer.  Rather than making baseline assumptions, do some further research in the future. All your comments and concerns can easily be addressed via a simple Google search. I'm sure you spent a lot of time thinking and writing this up. In the future, take more time and research any position you might want to make a claim on, both so you understand the audience you are addressing and you can see if you can back up your claims with facts and sources."

If you can't handle the thought of other people being happy, because you're unhappy, then it sounds like you have some personal issues to work through (which might even be contributing to the reasons why you're single).    I mean, take a look at your satirical post ""Hey guys, my girlfriend sent me this picture, therefore, it's funny. BTW, I have a girlfriend.""  Is it really that upsetting that people are in relationships?  If you're unhappy with your life, you need to make changes to live the type of life you want.  Life's too short to be jealous of people online for simply being in a romantic relationship.    If you want to be in a relationship, improve the value that you offer.  You're the product you're trying to sell, and no one owes you anything.  You don't ""deserve"" to be in a romantic relationship.  You have to work to be someone that someone else wants to be with, and very few people want to be with someone who can't stand other people being happy."

No offense - I know it probably seems like an epiphany to you, and certainly I'm glad that you're going to stop eating animals! It's just crazy to me because anyone would be appalled by shooting a cat with an arrow, but there's some kind of short circuit that happens preventing them from realizing what must have happened to the animals that they eat on a daily basis. And if they do even start to put the train of thought together, these mental gymnastics these mental gymnastics start in to try and justify a lifetime of unrealized cognitive dissonance.  One of those mental backflips is that people convince themselves there's some kind of innate difference between their pets and the animals they eat for food, so I guess realizing the similarity of those animals is where being a vet comes in.  Anyway, glad to have you on team veg! I'm from a family of hunters, and I've been going strong for nearly a decade :)"
vegetarian,3cbdsf,commissionerofwine,11,Mon Jul 6 17:48:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome, congrats on the first and hardest hurdle :)  It's tough - really tough - to realize that what is normal, what is touted as natural and necessary, may not be any of those things.  There were lots of us who were brought to vegetarianism (myself included) for very similar reasons as you've talked about, and there are two really good pieces of news.  One, it's going to be easier than you're expecting.  For a week it might seem a little difficult, but after that you're going to be amazed at how easy it is to eat without eating animals anymore.  Second, you're going to feel a lot better about yourself and your actions.  Trust me on this one, it's nice.  Please query here if you have any further questions.  I'd suggest trying to get into a plant-based diet as far as possible, because substituting eggs and cheese for the meat products (which I did for a time) is not any better for your health or for the health of the animals.  Take care and good luck :)"
vegetarian,3cbdsf,comfortablytrev,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"Cheese could be argued against, but I believe eggs are nutritional powerhouses... especially as a vegetarian with little-to-know worries over cholesterol. They're like animal seeds! Rich in all the nutrients necessary to launch a new life.   It is a shame that the industry is so abysmally cruel, but if you can buy better eggs or find the from a local source, it's at least doing more to help things than 99% of the population."

For every food you give up, you'll discover a new one you never even thought about before.  Edit: Also, welcome to the sometimes controversial world of r/vegetarian and vegan. The vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are NOT militant — but of course it's the vocal minority that's usually heard. Please don't get turned off from a very rewarding, healthy, happy step by fears of extremism! We're normal and unassuming members of society, I swear.  Yes, veganism is better people.

There is no humane milk, and eggs are fairly rare."

vegetarian,3cbdsf,Life-in-Death,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:44:33 2015 UTC,First hens we got from some people who had been keeping them for several years in their backyard much the same way we keep ours. They were old and I'm not sure where they got them from before that. We later got a few from a farm/ranch nearby. I'm honestly curious to hear how you could think where we got them from as being inhumane. I don't see it as being any different than having a dog or cat at home.
vegetarian,3cbdsf,Cbbcbail,-3,Tue Jul 7 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you are missing what I said in the original comment, and when I re-quoted it.    HERE IT IS AGAIN:   Okay, if you get a rescued laying hen, and take care of it and let it lay eggs, fine     Are your hens rescued or adopted?  THEN NO PROBLEM.  Were they hatched for you?  THEN THERE IS A PROBLEM."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,Life-in-Death,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:37:14 2015 UTC,I obviously got your main point ages ago. That's why I keep asking the same thing. What does get them hatched mean? What does rescue mean? What's immoral about the first one?
vegetarian,3cbdsf,Cbbcbail,0,Tue Jul 7 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"If you are buying chickens, if they are getting hatched for you, then all the male chicks are being killed, or disposed of later on.    It is the same difference between adopting a kitten from a shelter and buying one from the pet store, adding on if half of the kittens from the pet store were killed.    Breeding animals for our use is pretty much always harmful to them, especially in the case of laying hens, as the males are useless."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,Life-in-Death,2,Tue Jul 7 19:41:02 2015 UTC,"It is very hard to do either humanely. If you had a farm and can handle breeding your cow yearly and taking care of its offspring which come along every year or so, or have a relative which can, that's great. Also, they will need to keep the cow and calves even when the mother reaches an age where she cannot produce offspring. And chickens, while they will produce eggs without fertilization, which is great, will stop producing them after awhile. You will need to keep these chickens, as many who advertise eggs at farmers markets and roadside stands will butcher their laying hens after their egg productions ceases. You can see how difficult this would be."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,mustloverats,4,Tue Jul 7 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"I have kept chickens for years now in my backyard. Four of them, they roam the whole backyard in the day and a large pen to keep them safe at night. They have always been extremely happy and it is very rare for them to stop laying. We got an old one as an adult that had nowhere to go. She did not stop laying until she was on deaths door."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,Cbbcbail,0,Tue Jul 7 05:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, rescue hens are fine. But if they're not rescues, you can only do eggs humanely if for every egg-layer you have you give a rooster a home. And home them for years after they stop laying.  You can't do milk humanely unless you have your own farm. Milk = baby. And you'd have to plan on giving a home to a grown cow (including males) for every year you get milk. And homing the mother for years after she stops producing. If you do that, it's humane. But even the most local businesses don't do that because they'd go out of business. So it's not that milk/eggs are always terrible. It's that you can't buy good ones, and most of us don't have the land to do it ourselves."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,birdy111,6,Tue Jul 7 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"Woohoo! I say go for it - it's really not that hard :) Once I started to learn more about animal agriculture, meat stopped looking appetizing pretty quickly. Beans and other legumes (lentils, soy, peanuts) are a great protein source and are very cheap and filling so I ate lots of those at first. It took about a month or so to adjust to the extra fibre, if you know what I mean, but after that I felt fantastic! If you're looking for a bit of a slower transition I would suggest shifting your home meals first (either make substitutions to your old favourite meals or look up some new veg recipes to try), and then making sure you're completely vegetarian when out to eat when you're ready. Good luck!"

I made friends with some Gujarat people from India who had never eaten meat, and I just said ""That's it, no more""."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,defiantnoodle,3,Mon Jul 6 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on making the connection. Going vegetarian is not hard at all once you make your mind to do it. The reason can really be as simple as ""animals are friends, not food""."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,findsomelight,3,Mon Jul 6 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"First do no harm :-)  (I know, not part of the veterinary oath -- someday!)  It's really awesome that that was the event which resonated with you, since the origins of the event are quite the opposite. It shows that the direct effect of our actions isn't always the strongest, because that vet brought animal rights into view in a jarring way, fewer animals might be killed.   Check out the advice from the vegan vet. Not everything you are asked to do in vet school will be animal friendly, up to you how you want to navigate that but there are people who have travelled that path before if you want to look them up. In the end, I'm just really glad that there will be another vet who cares for all animals, and who can be a voice for them. The meat, egg and dairy industries are horrors but things are changing and those industries won't be with us forever!"
vegetarian,3cbdsf,llieaay,2,Tue Jul 7 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"Good for you. I came to this same conclusion 3 years ago when I started working with animals for a career, it really brings it into better perspective when you work with them everyday and form bonds with them. It was incredibly easy, and I'm sure you'll have no trouble. I quit meat cold turkey, and it was easier than I expected. But everyone takes steps, so don't feel discouraged if it takes a minute to completely transition. And don't worry about the vegan thing right now, even though some are already bringing it up. Transitioning your entire diet takes time, and no logical person expects you to become veggie overnight, and especially not vegan (if you were even considering that, I think you made it clear you are not. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about that.)"
vegetarian,3cbdsf,MsInternet,5,Tue Jul 7 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think if you go vegetarian for animal welfare reasons, all the same reasons apply for veganism, too and its the only logical choice, though considerably more challenging."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,rangda,0,Mon Jul 6 19:59:13 2015 UTC,I would disagree. Eggs and dairy can be done humanely. You just need to be careful about where you buy from.
vegetarian,3cbdsf,rangda,3,Mon Jul 6 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of humane.    I think that's not true, because of the male chicks not being useful, the necessity to breed and remove calves from the mother cows each year, and the fates of those animals.    Even if the laying hens and dairy cows are mostly content and looked after well like in many very small operations, there's unavoidably plenty of fairly vile stuff that is intrinsically tied in, and once the animals stop producing enough it's just the meat industry, still. They are one and the same."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,comfortablytrev,4,Mon Jul 6 19:04:35 2015 UTC,"Aw man, sorry to reply here OP.  I had initially written up a reply to the comment above, saying that those techniques used might not be the best way to bring compassionate people who are concerned about animal welfare to the discussion, and now I'm going to talk about this.  There is literally no way to get eggs and cow milk humanely.  Sure, every other commenter on reddit seems to live next door to an elderly couple that has raised the most beloved cattle and chickens possible and sell these products at insanely reasonable prices, but the reality of even these groups are that cows have to be pregnant or recently delivered to have a baby, and if that baby was male it might be killed for veal immediately (since most males don't excrete enough milk to be useful) and if they're female kept in a cycle of pregnancy for as long as economically viable (four to five years, so still almost a toddler).  Then the slaughter that all vegetarians myself included hate, and then ground beef or whatever.  Male chicks are killed almost immediately as well.  Plus if you have the stomach for it look in a little to how laying hens are treated, if you like horror movies :(  Anyone who raises their own chickens has bought females only from an operation that already factored in the cost of the unnecessary males that were killed.  So each egg you're paying a small percentage of as a ""slaughter fee,"" for however much it cost to probably grind up all those sweet male chicks alive.  Anyway though, seriously welcome to the group, I didn't want to get into any of this in my first post because you'll find these things out eventually and make your decision from there.  It took me a very long time to see the truths about these industries and I wish someone had taken the time to show me earlier :)  Please feel free to query the community at r/vegan anytime, or send me a PM with any questions"
vegetarian,3cbdsf,littlebratinsocal,-1,Tue Jul 7 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is one hell of a stretch you're making there.  So you can't even buy female chickens because male chicks will be killed?  That's like saying you shouldn't rescue a dog from a pound, because of the others that will be put to sleep.  I totally disagree.  I plan to own my own chickens some day.  And they will be my pets, and they will produce eggs that I will eat.  And it will be wonderful for all involved.    I am not vegan, and I don't think I ever will be.  I do my best.  If my best is not good enough for some vegans, that's their problem, not mine.  I have already helped a handful of people realize the errors of their ways and stop eating meat.  Progress is progress, you can't be so black and white about negative about it.  (this part is not to you specifically, but to the other hardcore vegans criticizing those who aren't going vegan)"

vegetarian,3cbdsf,bird_person19,8,Mon Jul 6 21:53:20 2015 UTC,I think it's a great idea to rescue hens. I'm planning on rescuing hens when I have the space as well. I think there's a difference between adopting the birds and giving them a lovely home and occasionally eating some extra eggs and getting hens for the sole purpose of exploiting them for eggs. That being said I don't really miss eggs at all so I'd rather feed them back to the hens or give them to the dogs than eat them myself.
vegetarian,3cbdsf,littlebratinsocal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I definitely never implied anywhere I'd be exploiting any hens for their eggs.  I'm sure with a couple hens I will have more eggs than I would even be able to use myself, and I would probably end up giving some away.  My plan would be to have them as pets, and enjoy the eggs they naturally produce anyway.  I don't see any exploitation there.  It's a mutually beneficial relationship, just like that with any other pet."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,bird_person19,3,Mon Jul 6 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"I phrased that poorly. I didn't mean to imply that I thought you were going to be exploiting the hens for eggs, just that it does happen and that is mostly what vegans are against."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,littlebratinsocal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:31:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think that's what makes the most sense... that they are against the exploitation.  But a lot of them seem a little more hardcore and more irrational than that.  I think some of them would never ever agree that it's okay to eat eggs, and I just can't really understand why.  I think there is an ideal circumstance where it's fine."
vegetarian,3cbdsf,janewashington,0,Mon Jul 6 22:45:31 2015 UTC,It's actually not a problem for vegans at all if your decisions support animal exploitation.  It's a problem for the animals impacted. Will you be buying chicks?

It might not be possible to provide a population of millions with harmless commodities, but I ate eggs for years from a friend who ran an animal sanctuary. Every single chicken on his land was donated or rescued, and lived openly and freely within his pens. (He is a vegan btw, very active in local animal advocacy.) It's tough, it's rare, but it can be done... so there's really no need to throw in LITERALLY (a word that doesn't even really apply here) when it comes to a farming practice that was humane for hundreds, if not thousands of years."

It's often more sustainable to take small steps and maybe become vegan later in life. Switching to veganism is a huge change from the average omnivore diet, and it's good to support people who choose to become vegetarians too."

I was DESTROYED by vegans saying vegetarians aren't doing enough, I'm supporting animal abuse, I'm stupid. The thread got deleted it seems... It was really a clusterfuck.   The reason I posted the thread was because I got insulted on /r/vegan when I responded to a comment about Paul McCartney ONLY being vegetarian and not vegan. I suggested that being vegetarian is a great start and we should be thankful that people are giving up meat.   If I can make one suggestion to OP it would be to not expect support on Reddit.

vegetarian,3cee4u,Stranglerfish,5,Tue Jul 7 06:55:50 2015 UTC,"One fairly easy way to gain weight (no matter what your food preferences) is to plan snacks into your day. Not junk food, but calorie dense snacks like nuts/seeds, cheese, or dried fruits. Eat three meals a day and two or three snacks per day and make sure you exercise to prevent the weight gain from being stored as fat.  Learn to cook! Let that be your driving force; it is a skill that will hold you in good stead through your entire life. Start with dishes you love to eat. Or begin with breakfasts - learn five ways to cook eggs, a pancake recipe, and how to make a nice fruit salad or a smoothie.  Set aside an hour a day to spend in the kitchen - from prepping to cooking to cleaning up - and you will be a fine cook in a few months."

For dinners you can do curries, chillies, stir fries, beans and rice, burritos, spaghetti and bean balls etc. Avocado and coconut milk are also good sources of fat. Tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, beans, and quinoa are all good sources of protein, so try to base some of your meals around those.

I'm vegetarian and recovering from an eating disorder, and smoothies made of spinach+blueberries+banana+whole greek yogurt+ almond butter are awesome. Almond butter is a tad expensive but goes a long way.   Also, here are some links to high calorie (but low cost) vegetarian snacks (all but the tuna are vegetarian): http://www.gainingweight101.com/healthy-cheap-foods-to-gain-weight/  I think drizzling olive oil over some rice and beans, with mixed veggies in there, would be super good.

It can be orange, yellow, or white in color, is mild, salty, and faintly sweet in flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a very low melting point.""

It is SO nice on its own!!).  Vegan Eggplant Mushroom Curry  Ingredients   15g minced garlic (or 3 cloves fresh) 10g grated ginger 2 tsp oil (I used extra virgin olive oil) 200g brown onions 600g eggplant 400g cup (white) mushrooms 1 x 400g can crushed tomatoes (in the U.S. probably a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce) 300mL light coconut milk 2 tbsp curry powder 1/2 tsp turmeric salt, to taste   Method   Chop 200g of brown onions as you prefer for curry. I did ~1cm². Dice 600g of eggplant. About 1.5-2cm² worked well for my version. Chop 400g of cup (white) mushrooms into quarters. If using fresh ginger, grate about 10-15g. If using fresh garlic, mince 3 cloves. Heat 2 tsp oil in a large pan or pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger, and sauté until soft and translucent (about 5-7 minutes). Add the eggplant and mushrooms to your pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until the eggplant is soft and the mushrooms have released all their moisture and cooked down. The pan I was using was a bit small for the sheer volume of veg, so I had to cook it (stirring constantly) for just over 20 minutes. Your experience may vary depending on the size of the pan you use. Add 1/2 tsp turmeric, 2 - 2.5 tbsp curry powder, and salt to taste. Stir through and sauté a minute more until spices are very fragrant. Pour in a 400g can of crushed tomatoes and mix well. Add 300mL of light coconut milk. Mix thoroughly. Test for balance of spices, and once the mixture is heated through, serve immediately!    Makes 3 enormous or 4 normal servings (but at 250kcal for an enormous serving...why wouldn't you?). This curry is delicious on its own, over rice, or over naan/chapati."

vegetarian,3cb0pz,Cerealcomma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"Fresh Garden Veggies in Peanut Sauce, aka Food Pantry Leftover Supreme.  This is what my meals tend to look like near the end of the month or at the beginning of the month before I've had a chance to go to the food pantry. For those unfamiliar, some food pantries work on a month-by-month basis where individuals or families can take a designated amount of food each month. When I first go, I eat up all the perishable things quickly (fresh vegetables, cheese, etc) and by the end I'm left scraping containers of USDA rice and peanut butter :P   The food pantry near me is fantastic! Normally I don't go, but I've been very ill the last few months and unable to work as much as I normally would. The food is a great supplement to what I harvest from the garden and eggs from my chickens. This recipe uses Swiss chard and carrots, because that's what I had on hand, but you can probably use whatever you want. I think it would be good with tomatoes, but mine need another 2 or 3 days.     Ingredients   Rice 1 egg (optional for delicious extra protein) Oil (I use coconut because it happened to be near the stove, but most oil should be fine) Vegetables suitable for stir-frying - I used Swiss chard, onions, and carrots, but in the past I've also used radishes, beets, spinach, kale, squash, and whatever else the garden has.    Onions should be sliced into thin strips.  Root vegetables such as carrots, radishes, and beets should be made into matchsticks.  Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, or Swiss chard should be separated from the stalks and chiffonade(d?). If you wish, you can also chop the stems and add them early.  Squashes such as zucchini, summer squash, and eggplant should be sliced and halved.  Tomatoes should be quartered, though I guess if you prefer smaller chunks they'll be just fine that way.  For the sauce:   1/2 cup peanut butter 1/4 cup very hot water Few dashes of rice vinegar Few dashes of soy sauce A dollop of honey (I skipped this out of laziness, we keep honey on a high shelf and I'm short) A drizzle of sesame oil (again, high shelf so I skipped it) Red pepper flakes to taste   Directions   Cook rice according to your preference. I like it kind of sticky with this recipe.  Make the sauce in advance so you're not panicking at the end to add it in on time. Combine peanut butter and water and whisk until emulsified. Add other ingredients to taste until a smooth consistency is achieved.  Begin to saute onions in oil over medium heat until clear. Add any root vegetables, and cook for several minutes, then squash, then stalks of green vegetables. Allow this to cook for several minutes until almost done. Pour the peanut sauce over the vegetables and reduce heat to low.  Add the leafy green parts and cook until done. Serve over rice. Especially delicious with a fried egg, as seen in my photo."

Breakfast: overnight oatmeal with soy milk, blueberries, almonds, and a piece of fruit Snack: Kale/Cucumber/Ginger smoothie Lunch: Lots of legumes, veggies, and greens. Snack 2: Toast (bread made w/o eggs) with nut butter and fruit, flax oil, and wheat germ Small dinner: usually celery and nut butter, hummus and veggies, or something else higher protein and low sugar.  Its entirely possible to go without processed foods. In fact, if you hit up the bulk section, shop smartly for your produce, and know how to cook, it is extremely cheap and delicious. I also garden to stay motivated!"

vegetarian,3cd1bm,janewashington,6,Tue Jul 7 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"If you want to eat foods with as little processing as possible, a plate of your favorite veggies, raw or cooked, does the trick. I'm legitimately offering that as advice, because I myself often just eat whatever fresh vegetables and fruit I so happen to have. Any recipes I have to offer include foods that are processed in some manner, so I went with the basics."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,sweet__leaf,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This is what I have been doing, but I'm burning out on my go-to's and looking for a little inspiration."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,thetimeisnow,8,Tue Jul 7 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"Well,  I think it's kinda rude to call what people eat ""gross,"" but why don't you just eat fruits,  vegetables,  grains (if the processing they undergo meets your standards), and beans (if drying a food is unacceptable processing,  you can get fresh beans sometimes)?"
vegetarian,3cd1bm,janewashington,11,Mon Jul 6 23:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not really sure what OP means by processed, since it's really a flexible term.   Also it's not too cool to ask someone for advice while calling the food they eat gross... So I totally agree with you on that."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,thetimeisnow,3,Tue Jul 7 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"I think OP is more talking about they personally think these foods are gross. Its kinda like how some foods are acceptable until you eat a better prepared meal and realize how much better food can be. I don't think they should be condemned for sharing their personal feelings. I think you are misinterpreting the tone they are speaking with. I know I have shared similar sentiment and not been understood , so let me explain further . There is a vast difference in how one can feel when eating these processed foods versus meals made with whole food. Many of these foods that are being targeted to veg*ns are cheaply made as they are made with byproducts from other industries and simply do not sit well in comparison with meals made with whole foods. This is not a attack on people that eat them but rather a valid and personal experience that is shared by many people."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,janewashington,5,Tue Jul 7 11:30:14 2015 UTC,"I don't condemn anyone for wanting to eat unprocessed food.  I would love it if those people would extend the same courtesy to others.  So I enjoy seitan,  frozen vegetables,  canned tomatoes,  miso,  and peanut butter.  So what? I know I feel good and perform well.  I think food processing can be an amazing thing. This is also a valid personal experience.   The ""gross"" was unnecessary.  I would think the same thing if someone made a post about vegetables being ""gross."" It's unnecessarily antagonistic."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,thetimeisnow,-2,Tue Jul 7 11:36:58 2015 UTC,"As i stated i think you are misinterpreting this and OP lists what they are referring to. They do not list frozen or canned  vegetables , peanut butter ( which comes in many forms, some more processed than others) or miso.  If someone said vegetables are gross  I certainly would not be offended or think they are being antagonistic because improperly prepared vegetables are gross. Raw and lightly steamed vegetables on the other hand can give me shivers down my spine they are so good. and others factors such as how they are grown can also affect their flavor, Ive had vegetables that taste like chemicals or whatever it is. Processed food is a bit of a broad term , but OP gave examples of what food they feel is gross in comparison with meals made with whole foods. They just want help finding recipes made with whole foods because obviously they have had a bad experience with the foods they have listed and they are not alone at all in this as many people feel the same. For me its digestive , I do much much better when my meals are made with whole foods, its a real issue."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,janewashington,4,Tue Jul 7 12:09:47 2015 UTC,"The foods I listed are all processed.    I understand your POV.  If you don't think it is rude to say what others choose to eat is ""gross,"" I doubt I will be able to persuade you otherwise."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,thetimeisnow,-2,Tue Jul 7 12:35:25 2015 UTC,"The foods you listed are not AT ALL processed in the way the foods listed are. I think the main issue is that they are made with byproducts and plus the additives that are added to make the faux foods. We dont know what protein powders they are referring to but  again OP is entitled to their opinion and I feel some of those are gross as well, especially those made with byproducts. These all come in many forms too. Again, i think OP is referring to their experience with these foods and its not a uncommon sentiment.   everyone is a people and entitled to their opinion in fact i find peoples opinions valuable and helpful in learning other peoples experiences. Ive had severe digestive issues from using the faux foods as staple foods. Unless they are made with whole foods they are considered junk foods to me. This is a serious issues and much more than just '' eww gross"""
vegetarian,3cd1bm,janewashington,2,Tue Jul 7 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"The way you have expressed it is more than just ""gross."" You are projecting your objections to certain foods on OP.    And I am sorry I don't have the list of okay processed foods and ""gross"" ones.  I thought OP meant ""processed"" and that is why they chose the word.  If another word was meant,  I would recommend actually using it. Canning is processing.  Freezing is processing.  Grinding is processing."
vegetarian,3cd1bm,Volundarkvioa,-3,Tue Jul 7 13:01:47 2015 UTC,They specifically say heavily processed foods and then list the examples.
vegetarian,3cd1bm,thetimeisnow,4,Tue Jul 7 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"Apparently the two of you are on the same wavelength.  Since you know what OP means by by ""heavily processed"" and how that includes,  say,  wheat gluten but not miso,  maybe you could suggest some non-gross recipes."

vegetarian,3c8tx1,jitspadawan,13,Sun Jul 5 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Burger King uses the Morningstar burgers (the garden veggie). You can buy a pack and make a real burger out of it at home.    Here's what I do:   Fry the burger in a pan. When it's almost done, sprinkle your favorite cheese on top (soy, vegan, regular, whatever you like) and let it melt.    In a separate pan, fry up some veggies, I like: mushrooms onions red/yellow/orange sweet peppers zucchinis add salt to taste    Now, here's where you get creative, you add some spices to the veggies depending on what flavor you like, your options are endless:    1) Basil Paprika Oregano ""Italian"" spice Mix in some sauce (marinara, pasta, alfredo, pesto, whatever you like)    2) Curry    3) Teriyaki    4) BBQ  If you like lettuce or fresh tomatoes or mayo or something like that on your burgers, you can add those too. But you don't really need any of them.  Once the veggies have had time to cook with the spices and sauce, put them on top of the burger.   Use your favorite hamburger bun (I like to toast mine with a light Smart Balance butter coating), and voilà, you have an awesome veggie burger that is way better than Burger King's, and you truly have it your way."

vegetarian,3c87dt,comfortablytrev,3,Sun Jul 5 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that, in theory, discussions around the ethical position of veganism should stay in /r/vegan and discussions strictly about dietary matters should stay in /r/vegetarian.  This becomes a problem because there are a lot of people who don't consider eggs or dairy products to be vegetarian, which leads to ethical matters to be drawn into dietary discussions from both sides.     And I mean ""from both sides"" quite genuinely, as for every unprovoked ""eggs and dairy cause suffering"" post I see, I see at least one post arguing, apropos of nothing, that you shouldn't be guilted for eating cheese on /r/vegetarian.    I think what people need to realize is that this shit is going to happen.  The word ""vegetarian"" means too many different things to too many people or there to be a clear agreement on what belongs where.  Vegans should just come to terms with the fact that there will be non-vegan recipes here from time to time and non-vegans should just come to terms with the fact that some people here will get into the ethics about eggs and dairy in conversation, and that it belongs here just as much as it belongs in /r/vegan.    No group of people who doesn't eat meat, whether ""vegan"" or ""non-vegan"" has more of a claim to the word ""vegetarian"" than the other.  You can make extensive, factually correct, and indisputably compelling arguments for both.  We need to stop pretending that the word is slightly more biased to one side or the other and just fucking live and let live here."
vegetarian,3c87dt,bingosherlock,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:55:32 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. Of course, OP’s post wasn’t about whether they should be allowed to promote their vegan views on this subreddit (they are, otherwise the mods would’ve removed those comments), it was to ask why some members of this subreddit take issue with OP promoting those views here. The answer seems to be that if you voice an opinion that you know is not shared by everyone in the group and you repeat it often enough, some people will grow tired of it. You can then choose to not to be bothered by that or you take it to a subreddit where there are more people receptive to your message.  Personally, I know that many of my views on vegetarianism are not shared by a large portion of the userbase of /r/vegetarian, and I’m fine with that. If I were to post on /r/vegan, I would receive even less love. Which is fine, it’s just not my crowd, I don’t subscribe to vegan philosophy."
vegetarian,3c87dt,sumpuran,24,Mon Jul 6 21:20:54 2015 UTC,"I only post here sporadically and I don’t know anything about the drama you speak of, but because your comment piqued my interest I just had a look at your recent comment history. In an effort to shed some light on why some commenters on /r/vegetarian might take issue with how you express yourself on this subreddit, here are a few quotes:   I ate meat for over 20 years, and was vegetarian for 8 years before becoming vegan. I understand that we go at our own pace for sure.   That suggests you believe veganism is a logical progression after adopting a vegetarian diet, and even that veganism is better than vegetarianism.   If you want to know why [vegetarians] might sometimes feel disapproved of by vegans, there's your answer. You're doing what we all want to eliminate, and you're looking for support for doing it because ""it's so hard.""   Most vegetarians just don’t subscribe to the vegan ideology. The reason they don’t become vegans has nothing to do with it “being too hard”.   if we can do it (and r/vegan has 50k subbed, not all of whom are going to be vegan but not all vegans in the world are subscribed there either) then why the fuck can't you?   Most people could go vegan, but they don’t want to. That’s something for you to come to terms with, not them. Vegetarians are not incomplete vegans, we don’t need to be fixed.   ""Vegans were mean to me, so I'm going to keep hurting animals.""   Unnecessarily inflammatory and incorrect.   We are all doing our best, as much as we reasonably can, to reduce animal suffering.   Unlike in veganism, vegetarians can have many different reasons to adhere to a plant-based diet. Worldwide, the vast majority of vegetarians choose the diet because of their religious and cultural identity (most vegetarians live on the Indian subcontinent or follow a philosophy that has its roots there). Others choose vegetarianism because of health reasons, yet others eat vegetarian because they cannot afford animal-based foods or it is not part of their local cuisine. Suffice it to say, vegans and vegetarians generally do not have the same goals.  Previous quotes were from comments you posted on /r/vegetarian, here’s one you posted on /r/vegan:   Vegetarianism is just a first step, though. A lot of people stop there [...] but at some point a vegetarian is going to be faced with some pretty horrible truths about the dairy and egg industries [...] and then that person is going to have to make some of the same decisions again (is suffering of animals important to me, is it important enough to me that I'm going to make a change in my lifestyle, etc.).   Never mind that most of the world’s vegetarians do not eat eggs, the quote shows your bias. Vegetarianism is not all about animal welfare – most of us are fine with eating honey, wearing leather shoes, and keeping pets."

Well, it seems obvious that vegans think ""veganism is better than vegetarianism"". If they didn't think that, why would they bother to go vegan?   Most vegetarians just don’t subscribe to the vegan ideology. The reason they don’t become vegans has nothing to do with it “being too hard”.   People say this kind of thing all the time: ""it's too hard/expensive/inconvenient/etc"" ""I love cheese too much."" I hear this kind of thing constantly. Usually it's unprovoked too...it's not like I walk around asking people why they aren't vegan.

I think this is a misunderstanding of what such an appeal actually is. It's not about not accepting you for who you are.  My brother, for example, smokes. I wish he didn't. I love him unconditionally for who he is, but if I get the opportunity to make a compelling case against his smoking, I take it.

You don't seem to have a suggestion of an alternative way to convey the same information, and you seem to be saying that you don't even know people that would use the term — implying there's no conflict/ambiguity in doing so. Am I wrong?  Anyway, for our conversation at least I don't see a reason to change terminology. I think you understand what I mean by that expression and a less verbose way of conveying the same information doesn't seem available.   As I’m not an ‘ethical vegetarian’, I’m not in a position to judge.   You wouldn't need to be an ethical vegetarian to have an opinion on this subject, you'd just have to be aware of what ethical vegetarianism entailed. For example, you don't have to be a pacifist to conclude that running around punching people in the face isn't pacifist behavior.   I would say it depends on what a person views as “immoral or unjustified harm to animals”.   I'm not sure that's the case. I think there's a pretty strong argument to be made that demand for eggs/dairy in the general case leads to the same results for animals as consuming meat. If you are skeptical about that, I'd certainly be happy to provide evidence to back up that claim.  Anyway, assuming eggs/dairy produce the same effect on animals, I don't see a cogent way to argue that consuming eggs/dairy is okay but consuming meat is wrong.    In the vegan ideology, any benefit derived from animals is unacceptable, be it from their byproducts, their bodies, or their labor. I can imagine ‘ethical vegetarians’ not wanting to go that far – many people who label themselves ‘vegan’ don’t go that far either.   The definition from The Vegan Society which was founded by the man that coined the term: Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.  Only the broadest possible interpretation of the word ""exploit"" would prohibit deriving any benefit. It's certainly true that there are vegans who would argue for this extremely broad interpretation, but I don't really think it's all or even most of them. I don't subscribe to that interpretation myself.   I think using the word ""exploit"" with a negative connotation requires some observable negative effect on the exploited individual. Cruelty, of course also requires a similar effect. I think a reasonable interpretation of veganism is rather less extreme than your current perception."

Can you substantiate this assertion? I wasn't aware of that, and as far as I can see there isn't evidence that this is the case. For example:   The definition they link from their main page doesn't stress that point: https://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/definition-veganism Their ""why go vegan"" section doesn't stress that point: https://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/why-go-vegan Their detailed explanation of rationale doesn't stress that point (PDF): http://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/CompassionForAnimalsedited.pdf   As far as I can see, they generally refer to the practical negative effects that people cause rather than the principle of not deriving benefit from animals alone.   Bees don’t suffer by us taking the honey they create, yet in vegan ideology it is not considered ethical to take it.   Human honey production isn't very good from the perspective of individual bees. In honey production, the queen is replaced every couple years even though queens can live longer than that. Replacement, of course, requires killing the old queen. In some cases the whole hive is killed off in the winter. Often a substantial amount of bees are lost over winter due to practices that beekeepers use — sometimes beekeepers just kill off the colony rather than keep it over the winter. Generally honey is a better food for the bee health than what humans supply (essentially sugar water). So there are definitely practical negative effects to individual bees as a result of producing honey.  I don't think it's especially likely that bees are sentient so I don't really see avoiding honey as an imperative, but it's pretty easy to do so and if I'm wrong then consuming honey is something that could be causing considerable wrong. I avoid the consumption of honey personally.   I will say that where I live, milk farming is done on a much smaller scale than is common in the West (here, farmers often have 2-3 cows or buffalos, which they treat better than they treat themselves).   I'm sure it's better than the factory farm status quo, but treating better than they treat themselves? I doubt that.   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-indias-sacred-cows-are-beaten-abused-and-poisoned-to-make-leather-for-high-street-shops-724696.html http://freefromharm.org/animal-cruelty-investigation/no-sacred-cows-the-dark-side-of-the-dairy-industry-in-india/ http://holycowvegan.net/2010/05/indias-horrific-dairy-farms-can-you.html http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/the-sorry-tale-of-the-milch-animals/article6578663.ece http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/whats-behind-that-glass-of-milk/article4675921.ece   Please at least skim that first link.  Cows must become pregnant regularly to keep milk production high. Roughly half of the calves are going to be male, and males don't produce milk. Also, milk production drops off pretty steeply as a factor of age. It really just isn't economically viable to keep male calves and females that don't produce around, and in India and elsewhere those animals usually end up being killed or placed in a situation where they die — tying a calf to a fence and leaving it until it dies of dehydration isn't meaningfully different from simply killing the calf."

Here, it’s just accepted that’s what you do if you want cows to give you milk.   I'm sure it's better than the factory farm status quo, but treating better than they treat themselves? I doubt that.   By which I meant that, in my experience, a farmer will sooner forego a meal than letting their cows go hungry. Here, cows are part of the family – in a typical situation, the cows’ quarters are attached to the farmer’s home. Those homes are in the middle of the village, next to regular houses. Several times a day, the farmer takes the cows or buffalos for a walk, through the village, to the watering hole or river. Oftentimes, I see the farmer taking a bath alongside his cattle."

It's basically impossible to counter an anecdote, since there's no burden of proof. It's also possible to come up with a custom-made anecdote to counter any argument if anecdotes are permissible as a rebuttal. That would be dishonest, and I'm not accusing you of doing this but there's no real way for me to verify that you aren't. This is an anonymous internet forum, so neither of us can really appeal to our authority or credibility as individuals. Because of this, it is my policy not to accept anecdotes as rebuttals.  That said, I'm also pretty skeptical of the anecdote. Cattle can live to be 20, but let's say they can live to be about 15 on average. How many calves would a cow giving milk have in that time period? If it's any greater than 2 then you are producing calves at greater than the replacement rate which means your population of cattle will continue growing without limit which is obviously not sustainable.  Additionally, your cattle population would have to include an equal number of males. The population would also have to include a substantial amount of non-producing females. Also, since milk production drops off after pregnancy and with age, each female of the minority that did produce milk would be producing it at a pretty low level.  To produce a convincing argument, you would have find a way to back up your assertion with facts, not anecdotes. Additionally, if you wanted to do more than prove that your own specific village followed that policy then more factual evidence would be required to make that case. I have an open mind and am willing to change it if compelling evidence is provided, but I hope you will understand why I don't change it based on anecdotal testimony in an anonymous forum.  It occurs to me that possibly you might want to prove a more narrow version of the argument — that it's conceptually possible to produce eggs/dairy (or even meat) in a way that is compatible with vegan ideals of avoiding exploitation/cruelty. If that's the case, then sure, I will acknowledge that it's conceptually possible but extremely impractical and certainly not the status quo for consumption of those products if it exists in the real world at all."

I just get annoyed when people try to equate the level of difficulty between food allergies and being vegetarian.  Take a few ambiguous food ingredients for example: modified food starch, and natural flavors. Modified food starch might be derived from gluten-containing ingredients. Or maybe a knife that was used to cut wheat bread was also used on their food. In that case someone with celiac can become ill for weeks (aka they keep eating, but the villi in their intestines are damaged for a while so they can't absorb nutrients well and are constantly hungry and tired no matter how much they eat). This damage done over and over again can also increase a person's risk for cancers of the digestive system.  A vegan or vegetarian accidentally eats something with natural flavors that turn out to be animal-derived. Guess what happens? Maybe they feel badly about it for a while and don't eat that food again, but there aren't long-term effects."

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations. Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter.

vegetarian,3c424f,coloredwords,6,Sat Jul 4 20:38:45 2015 UTC,You should search /r/vegan - I remember a few threads with plenty of info.
vegetarian,3c424f,Voerendaalse,11,Sat Jul 4 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yup.   When I was doing a placement at the children's hospital, there was a child brought in who was also malnourished. In this case, the parents weren't vegan, but they were feeding their child too little fat ""because fat is bad"". So they fed the child skimmed milk and diet margarine and stuff like that.   Anyway: make sure you know what nutrients your child needs at specific ages, I would say..."
vegetarian,3c424f,sweet__leaf,15,Sat Jul 4 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"This is totally misleading:   ""But the little boy refused to eat the vegetables they were giving him,"" he said. ""And so the parents returned to giving him just breastmilk, which is totally inadequate by six months.""  The parents literally only fed the kid breastmilk. No shit he's going to starve. This isn't about veganism. It's about stupid parents and bad parenting.  But it's easy for others to see the headline and say, ""Look what the crazy vegan parents did! Veganism is bad!"""
vegetarian,3c424f,purple_potatoes,9,Sun Jul 5 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"But breast milk is perfectly acceptable food for a 6 month baby....

Looks like they fucked him up when they fed him improperly."
vegetarian,3c424f,sweet__leaf,2,Sun Jul 5 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"He was 11 months not six. And if ""any food before a year is play"" then meat/cheese would qualify as well."
vegetarian,3c424f,purple_potatoes,2,Sun Jul 5 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"Exclusively breast fed is perfectly acceptable for 11 months. Meat and cheese would also be play.  The problem in this case is they tried to feed him solely solid food, and that was unlikely to be balanced. In addition, the mother's diet was not balanced, causing her to have a B12 deficiency and thus her child to have one as well.  A vegan diet is perfectly doable at any age. A shame these parents sucked at it."

vegetarian,3c424f,skulloflugosi,4,Sun Jul 5 11:26:41 2015 UTC,"This doesn't reflect poorly on veganism it reflects poorly on these parents. One of my good friends has been raw vegan for years and she has two kids who have been raw vegan since birth and are really healthy, one is 3 and the other is just a few months old. They are both glowing with chubby cheeks so it's definitely possible to raise healthy vegan kids."

vegetarian,3c424f,takingabreaknow,3,Sat Jul 4 22:25:36 2015 UTC,"I think there is more to the story here,  my son who was born lactose intolerant is on a 95% vegan diet.  (The only time he has dairy is at parties but only after eating a lactose pill).  He's healthy and growing but the soy milk I buy is fully fortified so he gets his daily b12 amount.  But even when breastfeed (while on a 100% vegan diet) and he wasn't able to digest the lactose from my milk he still thrived as his doctor failed to identify his lactose intolerance as an infant.  So even though I'm still concerned that his lack of breast milk lactose/sugar digestion as an infant may have had an unknown impact on his development nothing so far has shown that to be the case to date --3 years later."

A quick google search seemed to agree with me."
vegetarian,3c568r,freeze4576,5,Sun Jul 5 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"The gut microbiome changes with diet, so it is entirely possible that after a long time of not being exposed to meat the bacteria in the gut are not equipped to completely digest the meat products. Most likely symptoms should include stomach pains and/or diarrhoea.   That being said, can quite possibly be a mental block."

I didn't feel sick, it was an honest mistake and things like that will happen when you're a vegetarian, but it is sad that your father would laugh about it. A lot of people can't grasp the way we see animal products. Like people constantly asking you if you miss meat. It'll happen and maybe after seeing your reaction, your Dad will understand your vegetarianism better because of it."

I've yet to have the experience of eating a significant amount of meat accidentally. The though of flesh in my mouth makes me feel ill so I'd probably have a psychosomatic reaction more than anything

vegetarian,3c4p9d,bingosherlock,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"the reality is that if you rely on frozen fake meat substitutes, you're putting yourself in the same dietary shitbox as relying on any kind of prepackaged junk food, which is what the vast majority of frozen / prepackaged meat substitutes are.  you can make it work if you pay attention to what you're eating if most of your diet comes from  ""center of the store"" products or frozen processed food, but if you're worried about nutritional value, it's easier to hit that by making your own food (and it's usually cheaper, too).   this isn't judgmental or anything, I ate like my weight in prepackaged veggie dogs and veggie burgers yesterday.  I'm just saying that you need to look at pretty much any heavily processed frozen meat substitute as being pretty much the same as the rest of the overwrought horseshit they keep in the freezer section:  alright here and there, but probably nothing you want to live off of (especially after you get out of your early twenties and find it harder and harder to justify a junk food diet)"

Cons:   does not taste as good as any well made burger or cutlet. more salt than needed, usually. ( and depending on the product, more fat... Not that fst OR salt are automatically bad, humans need both...)    some thoughts:  You won't die eating lots of soy products. It is not as if soy is sonething that just recently became food people ate. It is tried and tested, basically.   But, it never hurts eating a wide variety of food, in which one might include ones protein sources. (If not for health reasons than simply to keep boredom at bay). If you want something else simple to start with, you might be able to find pretty good falafel mixes in the supermarket. Just a bit more work than pre made patties, but good and something different. :)   Oh, and Quorn is not soy based, it's some form of fungi."

I don't like it, but the alternative (watching an entire mob starve to death because there's no more grass) is objectively more horrific. If we have to take such action then it's only logical to use the byproducts as best as we can to avoid wastage.   I do really sit on the fence though about what impact a change to 'kangatarianism' would really foster. On an individual level it seems semi-sensible and somewhat sustainable. But it's only sustainable and easy to control while the overall demand remains quite low. If demand for kangaroo meat increased significantly the overall animal population simply wouldn't be large enough to sustain it without intervention. Enter a new farming industry from stage left, and an issue with over-hunting on stage right and you'd be back at square one."
vegetarian,3c58v2,shannonsnow,7,Sun Jul 5 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"The craziest thing to me about ""overpopulation"" complaints is that the overpopulation of humans is the biggest threat to ourselves and to the world we face today and causes MOST of the problems on the planet, but I have never heard of anyone suggesting we attempt to control this species' population. Meanwhile, kangaroos? Deer? Kill them all."
vegetarian,3c58v2,neshynesh,3,Sun Jul 5 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"China has had a one child policy for a while and a bunch of countries have educational/outreach programs about overpopulation and the need for birth control. So I feel your concerns are overstated.   While I agree with your sentiment, society places different weight on the lives of humans vs any other animal. I have to say I agree with the majority. Killing off humans is not a palatable idea for most people. In addition to that, animals such as kangaroos can be seen as pests, humans cannot be treated as such."
vegetarian,3c58v2,shannonsnow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:42:02 2015 UTC,"I think your belief in speciesism is also the reason the majority of people will never go vegetarian or vegan - most people don't believe animals' lives are worth anything so they simply don't care about their suffering. I agree that this is the most popular opinion, but ""common sense"" beliefs such as this that have been force fed to us are often wrong, however hard they may be to break free of.  And while China may have a 1 child policy, there isn't nearly enough lawmaking regarding overpopulation going on around the world to make any tangible difference whatsoever.

I think most people aren't vegan/vegetarian because they don't really comprehend/are actively aware of the suffering of the animals they are consuming as opposed to not caring about animals at all.   I don't see how valuing a human life more is ""wrong"". It makes sense evolutionarily, we are programmed to care more about our own species. If you were on an island with nothing else to eat other than fish/other animals, would you not do so? Self preservation is the most basic instinct and this concept can be extended to a whole species too. I, personally, see no need to cause animals suffering while there are better alternatives so I don't eat meat.   I also think you are making sweeping generalisations by stating that as a fact. That documentary posted seems like a pretty decent resource and it should reduce since of your qualms with human overpopulation and the perceived lack of legislation to deal with it."
vegetarian,3c58v2,IPYF,3,Sun Jul 5 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"I can't stress enough how unhappy it makes me that we have to conduct culls, but without population management we'd just disrupt the ecological table worse than we already have. It's fine to hate it, and hate humans for their role in it both past and present, and to bite against anyone who advocates killing anything but I'm yet to see anyone in opposition to animal population control come up with a viable alternative that isn't an adventure into fantasy land or based in simple indignation. We've fucked up way too much to just adopt a hands-off approach. It's triage, plain and simple and we're responsible for the maintenance of what we still have left."

I think I'm only going to eat it at home myself and when I go out for dinner I'm going to always order vegetarian. I think if all non-vegetarians switched then there wouldn't be enough kangaroos to sustain that demand and they would need to be farmed and if that happened I would have to stop eating it. That's why I can't eat beef, pork and chicken. I hate the idea of an animal being cooped up in a cage and mistreated just for our appetite. Animals should be out in the open and free."
vegetarian,3c58v2,Australianbigbrother,2,Sun Jul 5 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"I have no illusions that all non-vegetarians would switch, but any time a meat eater chooses hunted meat over factory farmed meat I consider it a lesser evil. Since you wouldn't otherwise eat a chicken, pig or cow in place of the kangaroo, I don't see that it's in any way a positive.    After I initially cut out meat, eggs, and dairy from my diet it was mostly because factory farming horrified me and I decided that I didn't have a problem with hunted animals. But still didn't eat deer meat because I thought it would make giving up other meat more difficult and keep me wanting meat in general. It would have sucked to give up the progress I'd made in changing my taste preferences and getting used to eating plant-based meals. Have you thought that it might be a slippery slope from kangaroo into gradually eating all meat?    Ultimately no one can stop you if that's what you choose to do. I do see an ethical difference between factory-farmed vs hunted meat, but still don't think my desire to eat meat is more important than a wild animal's life. Just try to consider it from as many angles as possible. There's the strong possibility that it might not taste very good to you anyway, since you've been vegetarian for several years. When I slipped up once and ate cheese after two months without eating dairy, it tasted nothing like I remembered, and cheese used to be my absolute favorite food."

As far as tofu goes, I'm not a big fan either. It's a texture thing. The extra firm is ok. I recently had some that was marinated in sweet and sour sauce and done on the grill. It was pretty good.   You can make your own meat substitutes too. Seitan is really easy to make. Add some liquid smoke and you have seitan bacon!

vegetarian,3c1m26,I_want_hard_work,10,Sat Jul 4 18:38:24 2015 UTC,It's nice if someone remembers my dietary preferences but I would never expect it. I made the choice to go against society so I don't expect everyone to cater to me.  When you say you have no preference you could say you have no preference as long as there are some vegetarian options.  Most meat eaters don't even look at menus before going to restaurants because they know they will find something to try.  They just don't even think about it.   I am also from the Midwest and there are very few vegetarian options so I usually just have side dishes. I have actually found that most non vegetarians don't even know what it means to be vegetarian.  They're so surprised when they recommend French onion soup and I have to explain I don't eat beef broth.

Because even if my friend knows I'm a vegetarian, they don't necessarily know what I like to eat and what I don't like to eat. I do think, since becoming a vegetarian, I've had to take a little more initiative with suggesting dinner options rather than just saying ""I don't have a preference where.""   Nobody's in the wrong, I think, but it's a thing where communication could be improved on both sides. For me, it tends to work out best if I let my friend tell me the relevant parameters (I feel like eating Chinese food, let's eat near the East Village so we can go to the movie theater from there...) and then I do the research to come up with a restaurant that fits those parameters and has something I want to eat."
vegetarian,3c1m26,janewashington,5,Fri Jul 3 22:55:29 2015 UTC,I expect my friends to be open to my preferences and opinion.  I don't expect them to research the menu for me.
vegetarian,3c1m26,mcac,3,Sat Jul 4 00:08:22 2015 UTC,If it's a one on one meal I would expect them to be willing to work with me but scouring menus to find something I can eat is my responsibility. Since I am the one with the more restrictive diet I usually try to come up with suggestions that I know work for me. If it's a large group I don't really expect anyone to plan everything around one person.
vegetarian,3c1m26,latrom,2,Sat Jul 4 09:07:57 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you do have a preference as to which restaurant you guys go to, it's just more broad than a single place. If you have dietary requirements you should bring them up when discussing where to eat."

vegetarian,3bya02,breakplans,2,Fri Jul 3 12:49:43 2015 UTC,I just coat each side with some cooking oil and have the grill set to medium high. It doesn't take long. A few minutes on each side. Maybe a little longer. The two best are Boca and the new Beast Burger from Beyond Meat. Both taste great and grill great.
vegetarian,3bya02,lunargrover,2,Fri Jul 3 13:50:01 2015 UTC,This great recipe by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt recommends oiling both your grill grate and the burgers.
vegetarian,3bya02,pipkin42,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would use a cookie sheet underneath them so they aren't directly on the grill. My guess it that you want to put them directly on the grill, but if you're anything like me, the burgers will turn into a crumbly mess. Especially since you're grilling for a fair amount of people, you probably shouldn't test putting the patties on there, but use a baking sheet instead. Sorry if this isn't the answer you were looking for. It's just that when I make black bean burgers, they usually aren't as dense as store-bought alternatives."

Most meat industries are not the way that they were saying and this common thought comes from media that cherry picks a very complex issue. Areas with little resources are the places that factory farm, especially places like New England. The thing is, everywhere else is not like that. Most farms are similar to this one in my area, with only one factory farming complex that none of the local farmers like. Even our big chain dairy/egg refuses to contract farms that put hormones in their animals and have very high standards when contracting them, because they're farmer owned."

vegetarian,3bvaaj,Bareback_Rhombus,3,Thu Jul 2 23:06:00 2015 UTC,"No one said they aren't cruel in a way, but they do live good lives until that point. Do you really want the animals to be treated badly because one day they're going to be killed? Because that's how your theoretic sounds. Also, animals on small scale farms aren't killed for ""not being productive"" very frequently, usually fees are more expensive than letting them live their days out if they are no longer productive. Factory farms, on the other hand need every inch of space and so it costs them less to slaughter the animal. Even if you don't agree with certain aspects, supporting the small scale farms is still a step in the right direction, to the end goal we all want as vegetarians."

You'll always get some push-back or just plain curiosity/perplexity from others that don't get the reasoning behind the switch.  What matters is that you made the choice for your own good.  I always try to educate others or best describe the reasoning behind the choice that I've made, but never with an air of superiority or animosity toward those that might belittle your decision.    As far as what you are dealing with between you and your parents, I would suggest try to educate them as well.  They're your parents; you have an inside track with them. If they back you up being that they're your support group, overtime they will understand and maybe even agree with your point of view.    As far as college student meals that are easy, sandwiches and wraps are ideal since they don't require much cooking and/or are easy to carry on the go.  Try getting some whole wheat wraps and fill them with shredded carrots, spinach, tomato slices, cucumbers, red bell peppers and a filling of hummus and Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream that might contain gelatin), a drizzle of olive oil or sesame seed oil, salt and chia seeds (the chia will make a paste) and voila, hearty meal with protein, fiber and omega-3s.

Telling people you're  veg isn't always the easiest thing, my family wasn't jumping for joy when I made the decision. However, they did quickly notice that we were eating healthier at home after I made the switch. Maybe you can make it about them a little bit, ""we'll all ended up eating more vegetables and trying new things together"". Maybe throw in that they're welcome to eat meat around you (if you're cool with that). Tell them you're not eating less, just replacing your meat with other foods like beans. As far as going over other people's houses, I just let them know ahead of time and offer to bring some veggie burgers for myself or something like that. Once my friends knew they kept it in mind when choosing meals, sometimes I made the sacrifice of getting sides at a steakhouse since it's only fair if they're keeping me in mind :) quick go to recipes for me are a stir fry or fried rice with leftover veggies, pastas, beans and rice (many variations and super cheap), fake chicken nuggets (rare treat!), chickpea ""chicken"" salad, veggie wrap or sub, and some potatoes here and there. I hope I helped a little bit, and most importantly congrats on your recovery!! Love yourself as much as you love all the cute animals we're saving :)"

vegetarian,3bxn73,meh89,5,Thu Jul 16 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"As someone who also used to be anorexic, I resisted going vegan for a long time because I was scared it would trigger unhealthy behaviours in me, so I know what you're talking about! I think that if you tell your parents you have been eating meat-free since february with no ill effects and that you aren't feeling any negative mental effects (or physical, but those would be less important in this case), they should be able to listen to you. Allow them to ask as many questions as they want, even if you feel that the questions they're asking are stupid; it will likely go a long way towards easing their minds."

You can get these at basically any grocery store, so if you're not comfortable supporting BK and the like, you can make them super easily at home!  Of course they're processed and not great for you but I agree that they're delicious. (PS I realize you're not vegan ((neither am I)), but those burgers have egg whites in them. Just goes to show how you can find animal products in the tiniest of amounts in the strangest of places.)"

I know that being a vegan logically follows from the reasoning that made me vegetarian in the first place, and probably also being careful about what I support and all that, but it is very hard for me to make that switch now. When I finally turned vegetarian it didn't feel hard at all because I reached the point where it made perfect sense to me in every way. Rationally, so does veganism, but I can't yet start implementing the lifestyle."
vegetarian,3bvjj8,raptorcorn,2,Thu Jul 2 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, being veggie at all is an amazing help! If you're considering making the transition to veganism at some point in your life, you could think about phasing it in. No eggs or dairy at breakfast for awhile, then also at lunch, etc. Or do vegan one day a week, etc. If it's already in line with your ethical principles, it follows pretty naturally. In any case, it's your food journey, and you have every right to take your time and make it work for you :)"
vegetarian,3bvjj8,raptorcorn,3,Thu Jul 2 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it s really bothering me a lot. I am trying to make small changes. I am for instance ok using almond milk and trying other types as well when it comes to substituting milk itself. But then we get to cheese, ice cream, chocolate, and it becomes overwhelming. Similarly, I like eggs but I can imagine dropping them out of my menu as such. But considering how many foods contain milk and eggs, it is a huge huge change. It requires a great lifestyle change. Now I can go about everything normally and just throw out meat, but as a vegan I would have to really get into what things are made from, where to go out to, and so on. Right now, I am really easy about food and can easily adapt to circumstance, but that would definitely change if I became a vegan.   Having said all this, I am annoyed at myself that this is my mentality. What is my personal convenience and habit compared to the reality of where that food comes from? I thought being a vegetarian was a big change before I did it, now it seems like an arbitrary line and like I am still putting my own comfort first. I don't want to be like that.   For instance, now I would never think to myself that I can have just a little meat as a treat because I didn't have it in so long - I honestly have no urge to have it because I am not rationalizing it anymore, and that is all it took. But I still have that distance with animal products despite the fact I started learning more about it and knowing better. i still look at good cheese as something precious to me and choose to be willingly ignorant, and I don't think that is a mentality I want to be stuck in. It's just not all coming together in my head as yet."
vegetarian,3bvjj8,needlecream,3,Thu Jul 2 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"You've got the right mentality! I had very similar thought processes to you, but I found that once I'd made my mind up about it, it wasn't half as bad as I'd thought (just like going veg). I've had awesome luck with coconut milk ice cream and yogurt (soy yogurt can be good too!), and I make a really simple vegan parm that even my omni friends swear by.  Taste is actually pretty easy to substitute, with the right recipes.   As far as eating out, check out the app Happy Cow, if you haven't already. It gives a list of veg-friendly restaurants and stores in your area, and I've actually managed to convince friends and family to try new spots with me. Another option is a quick Google search of ""(chosen restaurant) vegan option"" even for regular old places. You'd be surprised with how many places can just leave the cheese out, or use oil instead of butter, making your meal vegan.     /r/vegan has been an invaluable resource for me, throughout my transitioning period. The biggest benefit to me (aside from lower grocery bills and better skin) has been the gradual disappearing of dissonance in my life. Knowing what happens to the animals who provide your food isn't a pleasant feeling, and abstaining from those foods feels like a weight off the shoulders. Once again, do what feels right for you, and don't be afraid to ask others for help. Folks on these subs are really kind and helpful, and a big source of support for anyone looking to change their dietary habits to be more in line with their values."

You're also a bit low on iron and vitamin C. You could sub the yogurt for oatmeal for a bit more iron, and make sure you have lots of cooked leafy greens, beans, and lentils. Personally I like eating oatmeal with almond milk and lots of fresh fruit for breakfast as it keeps me way more energized and feeling lighter. Maybe also add a glass of fortified almond milk for calcium and vitamins D and B12.  Edit: and tofu has iron and calcium as well! You could add some to your dinners or make tofu scramble"

As for your diet, my doctor has cautioned me that eating a lot of veggies can actually make diarrhea worse, so I'd say look into grains that won't bother your stomach.

vegetarian,3br761,codeQueen,4,Wed Jul 1 14:22:55 2015 UTC,Why? Just get your crappy coffee and overpriced paninis somewhere else. Somewhere else that doesn't dodge taxes for instance.
vegetarian,3br761,OversizedSandwich,8,Wed Jul 1 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Devils advocate here - if Starbucks started offering more vegan food then they would be purchasing a lot less animal based product to stock their stores. Whether or not you get your coffee there would not really be the point, since the main goal would be getting a massive company to move away from purchasing animal based products. If they replaced just one of their food items with a vegan version, with the amount of business that they do it could have a pretty big impact on reducing the use of animal products."
vegetarian,3br761,jammbin,5,Wed Jul 1 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't be ordering less meat at all- the whole point of it is to entice vegans who wouldn't normally buy their food. A tiny minority may choose the vegan option over the meat one.  I see what you're getting at, but even if they did end up supplying less animal products they're still crap at paying their taxes in the UK so I'll just shop elsewhere for my coffee and £5 sandwiches. As far as I'm concerned vegan/veg lifestyle is linked to ethics and anticonsumption. Starbucks are shitbags so fuck em."

I do understand it from the point of view of ""gross"", but not the ""not vegetarian anymore"".

vegetarian,3bo9vw,pandalolz,5,Tue Jun 30 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"The issue it seems to me you are having is planning. Running to the store every meal you make is of course a pain in the ass. Plan out a few things you want to eat for the week, and buy all the ingredients you don't have at the store when you go. That will save you a lot of the time that you are wasting.  Also, general cooking tips:  Taste things as you go when you can. Don't wait until things are on your plate to figure out it could have used some onion.  If your food feels like it ""needs something"" it's probably salt.  Get good knives. It's safer to have sharp and quality knives and makes cutting things way easier.  Turn your stove down. High heat is for searing things and boiling water. Too many people use high heat for everything and you will burn the food on the outside but leave it raw on the inside.  Don't worry too much about the recipe. If you don't have one little thing it's no big deal as long as it's not integral to the whole thing working.  Baking soda and powder are *not * the same (personal experience on that one).  Read the comments in recipes you find online. They are usually packed with creative changes and additions to it you never thought of. Also, they let others be the guinea pig so you know if there were any issues (too watery, not enough of something, bland, etc.) and how to fix them.  Last but not least, start simple. Pasta and Grains go a long way. Once you get good at spaghetti, then you can move on to that 17 ingredient veggie burger with arugula and sweet potato fries you saw. Starting with that means you are bound to get discouraged."

Chia pudding: soak chia seeds in low fat coconut milk for 10 minutes or until gel-like. Add lots of fresh fruit like mangoes, strawberries, orange, etc.   Lunch:  I usually have a sandwich with avocados, tomatoes, lettuce, and different yve's sandwich meat.   Dinner:   Beans and rice:   Add drained canned beans (black, pinto, mixed, garbanzo) to cooked rice in a large pot. Add a couple teaspoons of cumin to taste, and maybe a tsp of turmeric, paprika, or oregano. Add a few splashes of hot sauce, and stir until heated. Serve with salsa, avocados, or tortillas.   Sushi bowl:  Combine cooked strips of sweet potato, warm cooked rice, lots of sea vegetables, chopped avocados, and some cucumber or carrot. Add soy sauce and sesame seeds to taste.   Peanut butter stew:   Combine 3 cups salsa, 1 cup water, 4 tbsp tomato paste and veggies/proteins of choice in a big pot or slow cooker. (I use some combination of mushrooms, cauliflower, tofu, Chinese broccoli, red peppers, kale/spinach, onion, etc). Cook until everything is soft, then fold in 1 cup peanut butter (or almond butter). Serve over rice.   I often do huge batches or risotto or pasta with lots of chopped veggies in them and snack on that for about a week as well :)"

I basically learned how to cook by doing recipes on this blog. The author posts pictures of every single step and explains WHY she does certain things and what you could do differently. Her whole goal is to make good food cheaply and easily. She also has breakdown posts about pantry staples, cooking equipment, and meal planning. I have learned so much and saved so much money thanks to her."

vegetarian,3bo9vw,lgcurry,2,Tue Jun 30 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Hey!! It is awesome that you are interested in learning to cook. I started out a lot like you, I moved out of my parents house at a young age and spent years living off of chicken fingers, and mini pizzas. Learning to cook is amazing, it not only feels great, and give you much better food, but the more you play around with it the more fun it gets.   Vegetarian and vegan cooking is even more fun because it forces you to be creative.   I started a vegan food blog with my wife this year that you can check out.  www.vegandaydream.com  Many of the recipes are fairly simple and use common ingredients. If you eat eggs and dairy you can easily replace the vegan version with those. If you have any questions about anything you can send us an email  goodfood@vegandaydream.com or talk to us on Twitter @vegandaydream.  As far as advice goes PhAnToM did a pretty god job, but here is what I will add  Always have flour, sugar and yeast. This means that even if you are super poor with a few other ingredients you can make something.   Buy things that last in larger quantities (potatoes, and sweet potatoes, rice, flour, beans ect.) then they are on hand.  Figure out your favorite produce to cook with, mine are red peppers, cauliflower, carrots, and shallots (small kind of onion with a milder taste).  Buy your favorites each week and use them.  Try something new each week it is fun!  Start with a couple of recipes that you really want to make and get good at them, and then start adding to it. Also don't get attached to a recipe if your pasta does not taste great it does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong, maybe that recipe just is not for you, find a new one and try again.  Nutritional yeast is amazing (Not bakers yeast that is yuck!)  Herbs and spices, again find a few that you love and then expand.  My favorites are cumin, garlic, thyme, paprika. I use fresh garlic a lot, but sometimes powdered is easier.  Most of all have fun, and don't be scared to screw up, I do it all the time. Cooking is awesome and food is amazing!"

vegetarian,3bo9vw,Gumderwear,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"Hi, that's great that you want to start cooking. I'm the same age and a student, so I try to eat cheap and healthy meals. Seriously, cooking is not that hard and once you know a few basics, you'll be able to improvise and come up with your own combinations, using whatever you have in your fridge at the moment.   For my pantry I usually buy in bulk and have: * lentils (red and brown), beans (kidney and white beans) and chickpeas. you can buy these either dried and then cook them yourself after you soak them overnight (cheap version) or already in cans (quick and easy) * brown rice, quinoa, couscous, pasta, bulgur * canned tomatoes * herbs and spices * tomato puree, curry paste  * onions, garlic * potatoes * nuts and dried fruit   Then I buy fresh things for my fridge on a weekly basis:  * vegetables (broccoli, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers etc.)  * frozen vegetables such as peas and beans * eggs, milk, cheese (feta, hard cheeses)  * fruit (apples, bananas or whatever else is in season)   My go to meals can all be made easily with these things. I also love cereal in the morning and I usually put some nuts or fruit in it to make it a bit more substantial. For lunch I usually make a packed lunch and make a salad with one of the grains and throw in vegetables, herbs and some protein (beans or feta) - this can easily be prepared in advance. For quick dinners I like soups (tomato soup: chop an onion, sautee, put in a can of chopped tomatoes, puree, put in a bit or cream and basil), pasta (homemade pasta sauce: chop an onion and garlic, sautee, thow in the canned tomatoes, put in some veggies like courgettes, carrots, peas, sweetcorn), or just chop up some peppers, courgettes, broccoli and sweet potatoes, put a bit of oil and lots of spices and throw them in the oven. Dips for snacks are also very easy such as hummus, guacamole or a plain joghurt dip with grated cucumber, salt, pepper and lemon juice.   What kind of food do you particularily like? I'd be happy to give you a few tips!"
vegetarian,3bo9vw,treelific_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"One thing that will actually help is knowing what cooking hardware you have at your disposal?  Knowing that we can actually tell you what you can cook that makes sense.  If all you have is a George Forman grill then it might be hard to suggest some recipes due to requiring hardware.  You can get by with a pot and pan, but I've found having a food processor and a good blender makes a world of difference in the types of stuff you can cook.  Even a slow cooker will make things easier when cooking chick peas, beans and certain roots.    Go to a place like Home Goods and you'll find some great deals on kitchen wear (if you live in the US). That, and a good set of kitchen knives."
vegetarian,3bo9vw,DarCam7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"When I learned to cook (which was also about the time I stopped eating meat), the learning curve was not around particular recipes so much as around basic techniques. That is, how to cut a particular vegetable, how to sautee properly, how to tell when different vegetables are ""done.""  The way I got comfortable with this was to hang out with friends and to cook with them. If you have friends who like to cook, chances are that they will teach you.  If you want an easy recipe to try now... well, since it's summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, it's time to make ratatouille. All you really need is a large pot, a cutting board, and a knife. This recipe is pretty forgiving; you are just getting a bunch of vegetables, chopping them up, and cooking them for a long time. Get a loaf of good French bread to go with this and you'll be very happy."

vegetarian,3bo7ue,Cerealcomma,5,Wed Jul 1 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"All of my meals are basically starch + vegetable + egg/dairy, so your recipe actually translates really well to a vegetarian diet.   Vitamin A can be found in most vegetables, but it's concentrated most highly in things that are red or orange (peppers, carrots, etc) or leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach, chard). Eggs also have it, I believe.   B1 can be found in seeds, kale, potatoes, and grains.   B2 is actually mainly found in veggie sources. Stuff like spinach, soybeans, and mushrooms.   B6 is found in grains (not white flour though) and in chickpeas and potatoes.   B12 is mostly found in eggs and dairy sources, for me anyway. I know that some types of nutritional yeast can also be fortified with it.  I've never had an issue getting iron - in fact, I recently had to reduce my intake drastically in order to get a medical test done, even as a vegetarian. Beans have a TON of iron - white beans have more than most meat, in fact - and spinach also has a decent amount, as well as cheese. An important thing to remember with iron, of course, is that vitamin C is just as important because it allows your body to absorb iron.   As for calcium, aside from the obvious dairy products, leafy greens and legumes have a good amount of it.     An example of a typical dinner for me, which is probably pretty similar to what you eat, is to saute some onions, peppers, and green beans, add some rice from the fridge (works better for frying if you keep it in the fridge for a day or so first), add an egg scrambled and some soy sauce, and then add kale or swiss chard at the very end (I grow this crap in my garden so I always have a stupid amount of it on hand) so that it wilts. This is a pretty nutritious, easy meal and you only end up with one pan to clean."

I already assumed my ""stir fry"" is easy to adapt, after all it's not much more than heating up stuff in a pan and adding rice.  From what I've understood, I won't a problem with the vitamins, and by simply replacing the non-vegetarian stuff with more plants I automatically get more vitamins. Since I already love vegetables, legumes, salad and all that stuff, it should be easy to throw something together.  The recipe sounds great!

vegetarian,3bo7ue,that_one_bastard,2,Wed Jul 1 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"Fellow German here. So I know what type of alternatives are available to you. :)  Rice is delicious, but doesn't have a lot of protein. You should try some high protein grains that are not too expensive in Germany. Bulgur, couscous, spelt grain (Grünkern), sorghum (Hirse) and of course quinoa.   The meat can be replaced with beans, lentils, peas, green beans and --- if you like --- tofu.  If you combine these two components with different vegetables, you will get most of the vitamins you need. Except for B12."
vegetarian,3bo7ue,amazonbiz,2,Thu Jul 2 07:27:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I really like rice - especially since I own a rice cooker - but maybe I should give those other grains a shot, since it's mostly carbohydrates with white rice. Maybe they turn out delicious in the rice cooker, who knows. If not, they're a great alternative to mix things up (no pun intended).  Today I had some great vegetarian curry for lunch, it was something with a lot of chickpeas. Looked easy enough to try at home ... :) From what I've already read, I should be able to get vitamin B12 from milk and eggs - since especially the latter fit into my food plan, I hope this won't be much of a problem.

Vegetarianism didn't seem like a common thing in China, and often when I told waiters that I couldn't eat meat, they responded with ""is chicken meat ok?"" What I eventually realized is that to the Chinese, having meat by itself, like steak, is super uncommon (unless you're going to KFC or McDonald's, which are everywhere). Most of the time it's mixed in with a bunch of other things. In that way meat seems to be understood as a flavorful addition more than a protein, so rather than just ""losing the protein"" when dropping the meat, they were cutting out a critical flavor to the dish.   There I'm sure are other cultural reasons explaining why vegetarianism isn't prominent, but I'd be talking out of my ass if I tried to identify them. This is just what I observed."
vegetarian,3bl7kx,Exexexpat,2,Tue Jun 30 12:48:59 2015 UTC,"Very true, so many times I'd order something without meat and they'd make a comment about no flavour, sadly they weren't always wrong as Chinese food often relies on the strong meat flavour to make soups and such more flavourful.  The main reason vegetarianism isn't prominent is actually that it use to be VERY prominent as no one had money. China is currently going through the ""OMG! MEAT!!!"" phase of development which we went through in the early 20th century when farming techniques took off and the middle class became so strong people could afford steak every night if they wanted. Give China another 10 years or so to see their people ballooning in weight (already happening) and diseases and they'll start promoting healthier living again.

vegetarian,3bl7kx,FurriesRuinEverythin,4,Tue Jun 30 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly a cultural misunderstanding.  Vegetarian means 'no meat', and their understanding of meat is just stuff like cow and pork meat.  Chicken isn't meat (it's poultry), broth isn't meat (it's broth), and fish is just fish.    It's kinda like my neighbor once telling me that jello or chicken bouillon 'isn't real meat', so I should be able to eat it."

I bought some vegetarian fish sauce, because I couldn't find it at home. Ingredients: soy beans, water, sugar, salt and ""flavor"" (glutamat, E950, E951 and E211).

I've been vegetarian for almost 8 years now, and I'm rarely hungry after I finish a meal since I know my body and what foods to choose.   That being said, foods that are rich in carbs, fiber, and protein tend to make us feel full and leave us satisfied after a meal. Good luck on your journey, it gets easier with time :)"

They aren't great for you but they are a good intermediate substitute as you adjust.  Give this Chilli a try as well with some nice corn bread.  Also you can still eat pizza, you can add some veggie you like to fill it out, mushrooms will become your best friend for a while.  Pasta with some breaded and broiled egg plant is a good one as well, or vegetarian lasagna.  Good luck!"

vegetarian,3bm9g5,bird_person19,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"The combination of beans, rice and avocado with salsas, sour cream and cheese or vegan alternatives in a tortilla is hard to beat for having a big filling meal. The beans and rice together with a source of nutritious fats is what does it. I'm not sure what those bean rolls and puff pastry are like, but were they as big a Mission style burrito, which can often be a pound or two in weight? Puff pastry can be fun, but it also takes up space with air that might make food look like there's more than there really is. It often takes a while for people to get used to the larger amount of food they can eat as a vegetarian, it can be something beginners can miss if a person started cooking as if beans were a 1 to 1 replacement for meat. Really they are their own (more delicious) thing. Maybe you'd need to eat three or four of those bean pastries, or serve your beans on rice or noodles, or some other grain or alternative, or add a second course to your meal like soup, salad, pasta or some other dish if you don't want to be eating four bean pastry rolls."
vegetarian,3bm9g5,brickandtree,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"Most vegetarian food tends to be lower calorie, especially if you're trying to eat healthy. It's very common for people to accidentally undereat when they first go vegetarian so you're not alone.   There are plenty of vegetarian things that can make you feel ""stuffed"" but it's not necessarily good for you, for instance I doubt you'd still feel really hungry after eating a whole bunch of cheese pizza or french fries.   The healthier way to feel full eating vegetarian is to either eat bigger portions and more snacks or to eat foods that are higher in healthy fats like nut butters, avocado, olive oil, etc.   Like any big change it just takes time to adjust and over time it becomes second nature. Once you get used to the diet change and increase your calorie intake you'll be on the right track. :)"

Indeed of my favorite filling meals is black bean enchilada casserole. I make it with beans, peppers, onions, corn tortillas, cheese and enchilada sauce; sometimes I use meatless crumbles if I have them on hand. Then I top it with sour cream, hot sauce and cilantro. Also, pizza always fills me up quickly."

vegetarian,3bmxoo,sweet__leaf,2,Thu Jul 2 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"I have love over diet.  When I cook, there is no meat involved (and I do most of the cooking, so he will do up a batch of something and add it into his meals all week), and when I go to the grocery store, I will not buy meat or even walk by the meat section after I saw tripe and just about had a panic attack in the store - tears included.  we don't have any vegan restaurants, so that's not an option here, but we do have trouble finding a breakfast place where i can get a smoothie and he can get his eggs and bacon, since we both can't eat toast. We found a place where I can get essentially a refried bean taco, hold the sunny eggs, and he can have his usual.  We have lots of conversations about meat ethics, sustainable living, etc.  I would love to convert him, but both he and I have so many dietary needs that all the mock meats wouldnt' work at all. I am content that he buys ""happy"" eggs, no milk or yogurt, very little cheese (and will throw diaya on there if I have some) and tries to get  more ethically raised meats at our market for now, and fish he caught and dressed himself.  Perhaps one day I will succeed in cooking enough awesome things without meats that he won't even notice, but as we just started living together, I'm not there yet. He's not pro-meat so much as doesn't know how to avoid it AND everything else he can't eat and still eat ANYTHING of substance (no, he can't have beans, much soy at all, wheat gluten, pretty much carbs of any kind, tempeh, seitan, or coconut, so short of nuts, we're kinda SOL)"

I just can't imagine a world without my fruit.
vegetarian,3bmxoo,breakplans,2,Thu Jul 2 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Explains why he's pretty lean.  Eggs, quinoa, kale for breakfast, or quinoa, banana or apple with peanut butter and almond milk, and lunch and dinner include meat and veggies, sometimes potato, roasted, curried, stewed, grilled, steamed, or turned into soup.  Some mexican, occasional pad thai or Indian take-out, some tuna salad, some salads and slaws (not enough, in my opinion)  I want chickens soonish, and he agreed to eat eggs and give away some, though I can't and don't eat eggs - I just think self-sufficiency and hyper-local, happy food trumps large-scale environmental concerns about the food system and average diet that led me to veggie life"
vegetarian,3bljt5,CemeteryCat17,2,Tue Jun 30 05:04:47 2015 UTC,"Hey!   Instead of worrying about all the things you can't eat, try making a list of all the things you can eat on a vegetarian diet and the foods you enjoy the most. If some of your favorite dishes include meat, try substituting this with mock 'meats' when cooking at home (although I wouldn't recommend relying on mock 'meats' all the time). Try spending more time in the supermarket in the veg section and be inspired to try out new vegetables to use in your cooking. Have you tried cooking grains such as quinoa bulgur and couscous? They're really healthy and delicious with veg. You can order a free vegetarian starter kit here to help you out. The booklet is super useful and will give you lots of tips :)  I found it useful to get into a habit of checking ingredients on items just to be sure they're vegetarian. (Rennet, gelatin and cochine, for example, are not vegetarian ingredients). Also, I used to get worried about eating out with non-vegetarian friends, but it's not so bad! You can speak with waiters and chefs if you have any concerns and they'll be able to assist you. My favorite eating out guide is happycow.net. As vegetarianism is growing in popularity every day, you'll be surprised at the amount of veg options restaurants offer these days.  It can be annoying not having vegetarian friends around to support you, but remember to stay positive! Just do the best you can and don't give up! ;)"

I have not tried the quinoa bulgur or couscous but I have a friend who actually posts about them both a lot (she isn't vegetarian) so maybe I'll shoot her a message get some feedback from her!

For lunch I either have leftovers or a sandwich. Easy sandwich ideas include chick pea salad sandwich, or a classic sandwich with tomato, avocado, lettuce and optional some yve's or tofurkey slices, or some fried tofu/tempeh or a marinated portobello or something. For dinner I make curries, pastas, chillies, stir fries, stews, or some variation of beans and rice with hot sauce and guac.

Part of the fun of switching for me was to learn about all kinds of new-to-me ingredients and recipes.  It also helped that my partner and I decided to make the switch together, so we have each other for support here.  Try to keep your diet balanced and don't rely an any one thing for too much of your food: e.g. pasta is great and easy to make vegetarian, but you probably shouldn't be eating only pasta.  Meat substitutes are great, but they can be expensive and it's good to also incorporate other  protein rich food sources: e.g. nuts, beans, lentils, quinoa, etc.  Depending on where you live, eating in restaurants can vary greatly.  But you should be able to get something at most restaurants, even if you have to ask that the meat be left out of a dish.  Keep an open mind and explore new foods.  I've also noticed that my tastes have changed since becoming a vegetarian.  I used to not be able to stand celery, and now I'm happy to eat it raw as a snack or cooked in meals."

You will need to do proper research into how to counteract these things. However ultimately comes down to your preferences. An investment I would consider is buying a good vegetarian cookbook such as ""Plenty"". This gives you a wide range of incredibly delicious meals making the such somewhat easier. A final word of advise is be adventurous. Being a vegetarian will allow you to discover some... Let's say interesting flavour combinations such as tofu and broccoli pizza (a favourite of mine).If you need further advise just message me I am always happy to help people during the transition."

It's been a little tough to go veg with him, but I don't expect him to change his behavior, I'll just be a little more active in where we're eating.    Chef culture is doing a lot more interesting things with stuff other than meat than it used to, so depending on where he's at with that he may be more excited about meatless cooking than you expect.  Just tell him that you love and appreciate his cooking and you want to encourage him to find creative ways to cook for you without meat, that you want to be an active part of that, and that you don't expect him to stop cooking and eating meat himself."

He still loves good, well-prepared meats and enjoys preparing them, but he's also more than happy to make vegetarian food and it let's us get creative together coming up with new recipes or ideas. I think he likes experimenting and coming up with riffs on meat dishes he likes and so on. The best part of cooking is coming up with things that YOU like and applying all that chef-knowledge in  tasty new ways. I'd be willing to bet your boyfriend would have fun trying out some new vegetarian dishes, or figuring out how to veggie-fy old favourites."

Maybe he'll enjoy trying out tons of fun new recipes like cauliflower 'chicken wings' or making veggie burgers from scratch. My husband ended up going veg with me, because he said he was too lazy to make his own food but he ended up loving it so much he stayed that way. The great thing about going vegetarian is your palate will expand like crazy. I would have never ate the number of vegetables I eat now that I would have before."

We always bring canned beans, lentils or fresh vegetables with us if necessary too.  We end up eating random things. Like this.  Boiled potatoes (with skin) and rice, steamed broccoli, beets and green beans; fresh sliced tomatoes and cucumber. Lemon juice and olive oil.  Lentils (for 2)  1 can cooked green lentils (or 1/3 cup dried lentils)  1 chopped red bell pepper  1 chopped onion (small or medium)  2 garlic cloves  2 chopped carrots (medium)  Cook everything in a pan with a cup of water or vegetable stock. Season to taste with salt, pepper and thyme. Turn off the heat when the carrots are tender. If you're using dried lentils, then cook for at least 25-30 min or until tender.  Mushrooms  Sauté 2 cups of sliced mushrooms and 1 chopped onion in olive oil with 1 tsp of dried thyme."

vegetarian,3bepo8,sweet__leaf,4,Sun Jun 28 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"On one side of the argument, gene regulation, expression, and interaction between genes isn't fully understood source. How do we know that the gene we pull out of a fish and put in a strawberry to protect it from freezing will only do that one thing?  On the other hand, you have foreign governments that want to protect their farmers from cheap American corn. US corn is so cheap it ends up being put in everything, and competes with the production of sugar and other grains. 90 percent of US corn is genetically modified. The easiest way to keep US corn from undercutting the local economy is to ban GMOs."
vegetarian,3bepo8,lotsoluck,2,Sun Jun 28 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"Not enough long term effect data. Scientists who play God. Etc...  Are GMOs bad for us? The effects of eating genetically engineered (GE) foods are still largely unknown. The studies that led to the market release of certain genetically modified seeds were conducted by the same companies that manufacture the seeds themselves, and the raw data for these tests have not been released for the public to see. There have been independent, peer-reviewed studies that suggest that there could be harmful effects to human health caused by the use of GMOs and the chemical pesticides and herbicides that go along with them, but again, there has not been enough research done and the jury is still out. Also, without labeling GE foods, we cannot associate any health problems with people who ate them — because we do not know who ate them. Since the FDA has no way to track adverse health effects in people consuming GE foods, and because there is no requirement that food containing GE ingredients be labeled, there is no effective way to gather data on health problems that may be happening."

The impact on the environment, whether catastrophic or negligible is not known. I oppose GMOs because unlike vaccinations and public services, they are not being created for the common good, but to increase profits. The motivation behind this means that you can't trust the researchers paid to create a study that shows these as ""safe.""   As it stands, there is an abundance of food available on Earth to support all human life. We do not need GMOs."
vegetarian,3bepo8,luthis,-11,Sun Jun 28 23:18:33 2015 UTC,Tell me more about how democrats are not doing the same.  Tell me how more taxation from democrats will fix everything that science dictates.  Tell me how science is 100% accurate all the time.   Not almost everything is GMO and that's why we need a better labeling and control.
vegetarian,3bepo8,zeeshopper,5,Sun Jun 28 23:55:59 2015 UTC,"That corn you buy in the store wasn't always that huge, the fruit not always that sweet, plants haven't always been able to grow in dryer areas, they have been selected and modified to grow better and taste better.    Are you serious?  What you are describing isn't a GMO, it's selective breeding. Most of the various products we eat are not GMO. Selective breeding and genetic modification are two entirely separate things. I've never seen anyone that has a problem with selective breeding."
vegetarian,3bepo8,gay_unicorn666,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you're for GMO and that's completely fine with me.  But everybody has a right to know that they are eating GMO or not.   Off topic, but no one says taxation will fix everything, but cutting taxes and spending certainly isn't the way to improve either. Just because you are well off and doing okay doesn't mean that others in society are, and being a part of that society means having to help out those that aren't as privileged.    I agree to a certain point.  It's our duty as human being to help each other, but it has never been the intent to give that role to the government.  If the government can give you something, it can take it from you as well.  Cutting wasteful spending and unnecessary taxation would be a good start."

The egg and dairy industries are arguably far less ethical than the meat industry, and becoming a vegetarian in many cases shifts to a higher reliance on these industries, which are incredibly cruel and unsustainable."

vegetarian,3be8bq,breakplans,4,Mon Jun 29 17:05:19 2015 UTC,I agree but I think it has more to do with a persons personality than anything.  I've been a vegetarian for 20 yrs and barely anyone knows.  I actively try not to draw attention to it because I'm not interested in the conversations that always follow.  My sister though changes her diet constantly and is very vocal about it.  She switches from omni/veggie/glutan free/local foods only/pescetarian/etc every few years.  I think she genuinely enjoys talking about it.
vegetarian,3be8bq,ganlet20,46,Sun Jun 28 20:58:31 2015 UTC,Part of the entire reason that meat consumption is so tied into our national identity is because of marketing and lobbying efforts launched by the meat producing industry.
vegetarian,3be8bq,MrMariohead,18,Sun Jun 28 13:20:11 2015 UTC,"Originally from London, I live in Bristol in the UK which is one of the best places in the country to live as a vegetarian. Most people, even if they don't share my point of view or life choice, with regards to not eating meat, at the very least understand and appreciate why I am vegetarian.  Despite that, I still regularly end up in conversations such as this and I find myself almost wincing when I tell people I'm vegetarian, preemptively expecting either an aggressively defensive retourt, or the age old question, ""oh right, but why??"".  However, oddly enough, I was in America for work last year filming a wildlife doc. Unfortunately we ended up having to stay for a week in a bear lodge in Wisconsin due to them owning the land we needed to film on. It was inhabited solely by bear hunters who spend their year bateing bears then charge people to take the shot during shooting season.  This isn't somewhere that usually takes on guests and certainly not somewhere that would usually cater for people.  They were catering for us and I was dreading their reaction to my vegetarianism. They greeted us politely and proceeded to show us around, including very proudly showing off their  ""trophy"" photos etc.  They said early on that they were doing a BBQ for dinner and I told them that I was vegetarian. They didn't even flinch, and for a while I wasn't sure they'd even heard me correctly. However, when it came to eating later that evening, they put on a massive spread including some great vegetarian foods.  This was an extremely suprising and surreal experience, but through my whole time then, they never brought it up, never questioned or commented, and continued to cook a fantastic and uncompromised array of foods for me during our stay there.  TL/DR: I stayed with bear hunters in America whilst on work and they supprisingly were very understanding and catered to my needs superbely.   I guess there's such a massive diversity of oppinions in this world you never know how someone may react to yours."

We have ""peasant foods"" and ""wealthy people foods"" and what they are is starting to change, but for a long time, meat was a luxury item, so this is a cultural thing. The average person in the US views vegetables as something their mom tried to force them to eat and that they feel guilty for not liking, and meat as a delicious indulgence.   You're right that ads could help to change this, but the ads are just reinforcing an existing prejudice and helping to take it to 11 in things like the bacon obsession."

She also offered me pizza multiple times by insisting that I just pick off the ham, all in the same conversation.  I basically use the same tactic you mentioned above, but I'm just sharing the one experience where it backfired.

It did take me 50 years to come to the conclusion so I can hardly turn around and start judging everyone else harshly. I think the world is headed the in the right direction in this regard pretty rapidly.

It's morally wrong to eat meat, but I also know that it's difficult to go vegetarian and vegan in the current world we live in, and not everyone can do it. And I recognize that making people feel bad isn't going to help them support my choices, and that I can't force them to stop eating animal products. So we all have to do what we can do to be a more moral person. Instead of showing people footage of cows in slaughterhouses, or statistics on cattle farming and global warming, I cook for them. And they like what I cook, and they want to eat it again. And then they are eating less meat. And maybe that will convince people, too."

Every now and then I'll hear someone bragging about being ""flexitarian"" because they eat a meatless meal once a week or something, and it can be annoying but I try to think of it as maybe they're new to this and excited, it could be the beginning of a journey.   I just don't specifically tell people I'm vegetarian because it's simply not true. I prioritize a plant based diet and am easily vegetarian when I'm shopping and cooking for myself, it's not something I even actively think about. However, I'd sooner eat meat than have it be thrown away because it didn't get eaten by anyone, which is something that happens fairly often in my family. It all depends on where and whom with I'm living at the time. (Also, most the meat my family eats is hunted rather than farmed.)  For a little while I struggled with what title that would be. I was talking about this with my friend (who's been vegetarian for 10+ years), and she said, ""You know what that's called? Responsible."" Since then I haven't cared too much about titles."

Yes I know it's a bit hypocritical.). I eat fish for some reasons. First of all, it's much harder for me to skip fish culturally - we eat quite a lot of fish and my parents, who I rely on much, wouldn't support that in the same way the support me not eating other meat.   Second of all, I differ a fish from a cow or pig in the sense that fish can't comprehend their existence to the same extent as a cow or pig can. Everyone has to draw a line, including vegans (insects gets killed growing crops for example. Also I am not blaming anyone for the insects dying, nor do I blame vegans; my point is simply that at some point it becomes to hard to abstain from something, in this example insects.) and I draw mine at fish. I do, however, realize that fish can feel pain and that they're at least slightly aware of their existence, which is why I aim to cut it out of my diet when I move out from home.   I am also only eating fish that has been sustainably fished and that doesn't suffer too much.  Please note that these are just my thoughts and reasoning. I know I am a bit of a hypocrite, but I just wanted to give my point of view."

Killing is wrong except in exceptional circumstances where it is acceptable. So we agree to enforce laws against murder -- except in those exceptional circumstances.   Similarly, murdering animals is wrong. I will fight until society protects them from being murdered for no reason. Does that mean that someone who killed an animal because otherwise they would starve would be punished? Of course not. That person would get a pass just like someone who killed in self defense.  But that does not mean I stay silent while we abuse and kill billions of defenseless animals a year in what is almost never self defense or starvation or necessary. I will fight for them, just like I would for human victims, and make exceptions in analogous cases."

vegetarian,3be8bq,comfortablytrev,7,Mon Jun 29 01:42:58 2015 UTC,Well I made the switch because I decided that it is an objectively more moral lifestyle. So how could I not think that I am a more moral person when it comes to that subject?
vegetarian,3be8bq,pandalolz,3,Sun Jun 28 19:49:00 2015 UTC,There's a difference between believing (silently) that you're right and telling others outright that they're wrong.
vegetarian,3be8bq,breakplans,3,Sun Jun 28 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"There's also a difference between saying that a person is wrong and saying that certain actions are wrong. Actions should definitely be judged and we should discourage those that harm others. If you saw a four-year-old kick a puppy and laugh, you would hopefully go and tell them that kicking puppies is wrong. You don't have to tell the kid that he is a horrible person. But you should definitely speak out for the puppy's well-being. Wouldn't you agree?"
vegetarian,3be8bq,felinebeeline,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yep I definitely would. I was over-simplifying things for the sake of the comment. But in the case of meat eating, if you just go up to someone while they're eating a burger and tell them how horrible that action is, and how they shouldn't do that for the cow's well-being... well, they're not a child. Adults don't react super well to that. They need subtler nudges to realize the issues with the meat industry.  I've known for ages how terrible it is, was a veg on and off for a while since high school, but would always go back to the chicken wings and cheeseburgers because everyone else was eating it and it was delicious, you know? But I finally made myself sit down and think about it for real, and cold turkey dropped all meat about 6 weeks ago. If someone had come up and told me, hey you shouldn't eat that, you're a bad person, I probably would've been offended. It's something we have to tread lightly on."

I was using that as an argument against your previous statement regarding the kid who kicks a puppy. I just thought the analogy didn't work because of course you'd tell a kid not to kick a puppy. But you wouldn't just ""of course"" tell an adult they're being a dick if you want to be taken seriously. You need to play the slow con with omni adults if you want to change their mind.  My original point was just that while you may know you're being more moral for being vegan or vegetarian, it's not something that should be shouted from the rooftops lest you enjoy proliferating shitty veg stereotypes. (But I realize you agree with that.)"

But I've seen it enough to be able to say that it's not a one off person.  And any time I bring it up, other people from /r/vegan downvote me to try to shut me up or because they think it's OK to kill humans but not to kill animals."

I mean, I can understand not being a dick about it, but I think everyone in this sub would agree that there are a lot of unethical things about animal agriculture.

vegetarian,3beo64,bewareofduck,3,Sun Jun 28 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"The best thing I ever learnt about building mass as a ovo-lacto vegetarian is this. For breakfast everyday if your cholesterol is normal eat this: 2 whole eggs, 5 eggwhites, 125g low-fat cottage cheese (Scrambled fat-free adding your choice of veggies/herbs) followed by 200g of Greek Low-fat yoghurt. That breakfast is a staggering 60-70 grams of protein depending on the size of your eggs. It has approximately 500 cals. It keeps you so full and is more than half the protein most people need in a day. So before your day even starts you have had a huge amount of really easily digested protein. Hope it helps you like it did me!  Edit: Just re-reading your post and obviously you would be much better off using full fat dairy products. Add calories in wherever you can. Like hard cheese in the eggs, cooking the eggs in a bit of butter, toast with your eggs, fruit and granola in your yoghurt."

I'm not going to offer caloric advice, because information is readily available regarding how much intake you should have ( /r/fitness ) and it's very specific to the individual, so only you will really be able to figure it out.   Diet-wise, I try to pack protein into whatever I eat, because it's definitely harder as a vegetarian, so, lots of whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread for carb sources. Other than that, I eat a lot of nuts (be careful, fast calories), Greek yogurt, and eggs.   Whey concentrate can also be a great cheap source of protein if you get it at the right place. The whey I buy at Costco is $40 for something like 2,000 grams of protein.   Hope this helps! Veggie athletes unite!"

That's because it's American and they don't have to stick to the PDO doesn't extend there. Inside the EU parmesan cheese typically comes like this. The grated varieties have a much much courser texture and a lot stronger of a flavour. Because of the DPO we aren't allowed to call the vegetarian stuff ""parmesan"" because, well, it's not. It's called Italian Hard Cheese so it's pretty easy to spot the difference. This is one example. It's from a grocery store chain's own line. There are a few others out there as well which are pretty easy to spot because they are called ""Italian Hard Cheese"" and never mention the word parmesan.  edit: As far as I can tell from when I've been in America a lot of cheeses don't use animal rennet, because it's more expensive and you aren't stuck to the rules the EU imposes on cheeses."

All you need to do is read the damn label, and trust me, I've spent over a decade reading the labels of Parmesan cheese products.  True Parmesans have rennet, and anyone claiming otherwise isn't talking about Parmesan cheese, they're talking about something that is similar.    we aren't allowed to call the vegetarian stuff ""parmesan"" because, well, it's not.    Exactly.   No rennet = not Parmesan.  Literally 100% of Parmesan cheeses have rennet. Americans don't get to define Parmesan cheese."
vegetarian,3bbct7,SolomonKull,-1,Sun Jun 28 17:46:54 2015 UTC,Well it's a good thing I didn't mention Canada then at all. I mentioned the EU and America. Canada is neither of those.   You need to take it down a notch. Your reply is a bit hostile.
vegetarian,3bbct7,Snoron,0,Sun Jun 28 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you would mention the EU or America when I never mentioned it. I mentioned Parmesan cheese.  Literally 100% of Parmesan cheese is non-vegetarian, no matter how many stupid anecdotes or European laws you cite."
vegetarian,3bbct7,yourcaribou,3,Sun Jun 28 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately what you are saying only applies to ""Parmigiano-Reggiano"", which has a strict definition and has to be made a certain way (in the way that you've defined, with rennet) - but more importantly, under that name it is widely understood to be so, which is how definitions of words work.  ""Parmesan"" however does not have a strict definition, and is also not widely understood to be a strict definition. You are not even totally right that ""Americans don't get to define Parmesan cheese."" In general that's not how definitions work - if a word is used in a certain way by enough people then yes they do get to define it. That's basically how the definitions of all words came about, and parmesan is no exception.  Parmesan is a pretty generic term for a cheese, and if you had any clue about cheese terminology at all you wouldn't have even used that word to refer to this type of cheese in the first place, but instead Parmigiano-Reggiano.  As Wikipedia says, for example:   Outside Europe, the name ""Parmesan"" has become genericized, and may denote any of a number of hard Italian-style grating cheeses   For some reason you think that you get to define the word parmesan, and you have personally decided that it can't be made without rennet. Unfortunately the rest of the world disagrees with you, and it's the rest of the world that gets to define it collectively.  At the heart of it, you're trying to argue semantics without even understanding the semantics. You're not even technically correct."
vegetarian,3bbct7,SolomonKull,2,Sun Jun 28 21:10:44 2015 UTC,What!?! How have I never heard about rennet in the last 8 years? I love(d) parmesan. Heartbroken...
vegetarian,3bbct7,omegaman1111,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:09:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for being the barer of bad news. I know what it's like to learn about rennet, and it's heartbreaking. It's used in the production of many cheeses."
vegetarian,3bbct7,omegaman1111,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"If you eat dairy products, you're supporting meat products anyway. Rennet mostly comes from veal calves.  Veal calves come from dairy cows.  The motivation behind worrying about rennet in your cheese is mysterious to me.  I know, vegetarians don't usually want to think that hard about it because dairy products seem indispensable."
vegetarian,3bbct7,Slushij,6,Sun Jun 28 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"As a strict no meat ovo-lacto vegetarian for several years in the past, I understand there's a psychological rationalization involving not putting actual meat in your mouth, but if you're connecting the dots and being intellectually honest, it's hard to maintain the belief that no harm comes to animals from the dairy industry.  Dairy cows exist to become impregnated - until they are too old and worn out - then they become meat.  Male dairy calves are separated at birth and become meat.  Even the most warm and fuzzy old fashioned organic artisan dairy farms don't have any petting zoos for male livestock as far as I can tell.  I sometimes see cute photos of calves being cared for as apparent PR campaigns, but I believe that's about as far as it goes for male calves.  Anyway, it wasn't my intention to argue for veganism at this time, I was just responding to the discussion about rennet, because as I see it there's a lot of blurry lines in the ovo-lacto diet as it is."
vegetarian,3bbct7,repofangirlie,3,Sun Jun 28 19:50:19 2015 UTC,"Aaah now I get what you meant. I misinterpreted you're post quite a bit. I think you're right, vegetarianism is kinda ""inconsequent"" and every vegetarian has to know for himself where he draws the line. For me as a new vegetarian it's milk and dairy products = ok (even though I know animals still have to suffer and animals are still dying because the milk industry is fucked up), rennet = not ok. Maybe this will change in the future, maybe at some point I'm even ready to go vegan, but I don't know that right now."

(The recipe I adapted this from doesn't mention this, but I like to firm them up on a skillet with a touch of olive oil so they nice and firm on the outside.  I think this helps a lot with the texture for those new to tofu.  Then you can just set the firmed tofu aside until later). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute the onion and garlic for 2 minutes.  Add the tomato paste, broth, tomatoes, wine, herbs, salt, and spices and stir until thoroughly blended.  Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 20 minutes, stirring often. Add the tofu squares and continue to simmer until the tofu is heated through.  Serve the caccciatore with pasta of your choice (I prefer bowtie).   This is a fun recipe that tolerates a lot of winging it.  So be creative."

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a deep sauce pan, add the garlic and dried herbs (if using) and cook for 3 minutes before adding the onion and mushrooms.  Continue to cook for 7-10minutes, or until onion becomes translucent and garlic starts to turn golden.  Add the tomatoes along with fresh herbs (if using) and bring to a boil.  Cover, turn heat to simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.   Preheat oven to 400F.  Use 1/4 cup of the sauce to ""grease"" all sides of a 2 qt casserole dish.  Place 1/3 of the pasta down in the casserole dish then cover with half of the soft mozzarella, half of the ricotta, and 1/3 of the provolone. Cover with 1/3 of the sauce and Repeat x2 topping the last layer with the last of the sauce, provolone, and the shredded mozzarella cheese.  Cover with foil (or lid) and bake for 20 minutes, then remove lid and bake for a final 30 minutes.  Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.

Earlier we said that going meatless makes a bigger impact than any other action you can take. Here's an example: If you gave up showering, you'd save less water than what's required to make a single pound of beef. Not beef for a whole year, just one miserable pound. A whole year's worth of showers takes about 5,200 gallons, but it takes 5,214 gallons to produce a single pound of beef.  If you gave up beef, you'd save over 300,000 gallons a year. A whole lot more than you could save by never showering.""  From http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/water-conservation-tips/  ""That quarter pounder is worth more than 30 average American showers. One of the easiest ways to SLIM your water footprint is to eat less meat and dairy. Another way is to choose grass-fed, rather than grain-fed, since it can take a lot of water to grow corn and other feed crops."""

I tried to stop being vegetarian and it didn't work either - I didn't like the taste of meat, or the feeling of eating anything that wasn't vegetarian.

Animals shouldn't be exploited and/or killed because they taste good to us and we have done it for a trillion years.  If you eat the fish your sister brings home, then she'll bring home more fish, and you will have in some way increased the demand for fish, at least for the leftover fish.

I hate the idea of wasting something as well, and I would have no problems with eating meat that would be thrown away otherwise.   If you feel comfortable eating the leftover fish, then you should definitely eat it. You're not doing any less harm than you would by not eating it.

A lot of my vegetarianism stems from having a respect for animals. To me,  killing an animal and then throwing it in the garbage is more disrespectful than killing an animal and eating it for fuel. Of course, the least disrespectful thing is just not killing the animal but if you have no control over that part of the situation you can mitigate the wrong."

The meat thrown in the dumpster is miniscule compared to the the mass of the dead fish/marine animals who were also killed to produce it.  Relevant facts:    3/4 of the world’s fisheries are exploited 90 million tons of fish are pulled from our oceans each year As many as 2.7 trillion animals are pulled from the ocean each year For every 1 pound of fish caught, up to 5 pounds of unintended marine species are caught and discarded as by-kill As many as 40% (63 billion pounds) of fish caught globally every year are discarded Scientists estimate as many as 650,000 whales, dolphins and seals are killed every year by fishing vessels  100 million tons of fish are caught annually Fish catch peaks at 85 million tons 40-50 million sharks killed in fishing lines and nets   It's extreme and the safest way to not promote it is to boycott."

If it is NECESSARY that myself or another being must suffer for one of us to live, is one of us MUST perish, I will choose myself over all non-humans and many humans.

vegetarian,3bbugx,jabels,7,Sat Jun 27 19:04:22 2015 UTC,I was reading some anti-vegetarian points and one of them said plants feel pain/fear and it's unreasonable to put animal life above plant life.
vegetarian,3bbugx,jabels,12,Sat Jun 27 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"Firstly, everyone else, don't downvote this person. If you disagree, explain why!  There's a couple of things that I would point out here. Firstly, there is no scientific underpinning of the claim that plants ""feel"" anything. Animals feel pain through the action of their nervous system, which plants lack. Animals are (generally) motile, and pain serves as a cue to get out of there, or to avoid a stimulus. Plants can't really do either of those things so the evolution of a pain response would not be adaptive.  Secondly, even if plants do feel pain, which might be impossible to prove philosophically (even though there is no reason to believe this is the case!) growing food animals requires more plants to die for THEM to eat, so this is actually STILL a bad argument from carnists, even though it is not true.  So rest easy. You don't have to not exist to minimize suffering. Eating a vegan diet will completely eliminate your suffering footprint in this regard, and a vegetarian diet will greatly reduce it. Furthermore, your continued existence as a veg*n helps the shifting trend in modern times towards less animal cruelty. So go out there and (without preaching, because that is certainly not effective) be a role model and a patient example that the arguments in support of the status quo are wrong. =)"

vegetarian,3bbugx,Flewtea,4,Wed Jul 1 06:28:48 2015 UTC,"I would add to jabels' very good post that many plants literally want you to eat them. That's the entire point of fruits and seeds. The only thing you can arguably say isn't intended for eating is leaves, like lettuce and kale. The plant's entire goal is to create seeds and then get other, more mobile, creatures to spread them.   Also, plants are, almost by definition, very regenerative. You pick an apple, there are 50 more. You pick a leaf, it grows another--and in many cases, trimming helps the plant stay alive longer and healthier. Very few animals have such capability and I'm not aware of any that actually seek it out."

vegetarian,3bbugx,Volundarkvioa,5,Sat Jun 27 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"If plants feel pain (keep in mind they do not, but let's hypothetically say they did), there would be less plant suffering by eating only plants and not animals as well. In order for us to consume animals, they must eat as well, otherwise they will starve to death. They need nutrients as much as we do, in order to build their own muscle mass (which is what ""meat"" generally refers to: skeletal muscle mass, especially mammalian tissue).  There's also the issue of deforestation. As more humans are born and as more food is required, we need to make room for more pastures and farmlands. That can be either for the crops we grow or for the animals we raise, we've got to level parts of forests.  By switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can use less plants and therefore if plants felt pain, this would contribute to less suffering.  Now in terms of you justifying your existence, all creatures did not choose to be born. Life itself was forced unto you. Because you did not actively choose to be a part of life, there is no reason you should have to justify your existence any more-so than any other human or any other creature should have to justify their existence. Justification is a valid tool of consideration for when choice creates a problem. When choice is not a power bestowed upon us, there is no reason to argue justification because there was no justification to be made. There was no choice to participate or to not participate."

Look at your own response, which ignores the point I'm trying to make because you are so focussed on the ""correct"" definition of the word as it applies to a person's identity.  My point is that everyone should EAT as vegetarian as they feel they want to, and hopefully everyone will EAT more vegetarian as they become aware of the various good reasons to do so.  ""Being"" vegetarian is a red herring, and the identity politics surround the concept of ""being"" this or that are divisive and self-defeating.

The problem is ""meat"" refers to one category of skeletal muscle mass, it does not all encompass every type of skeletal muscle mass (and to be fair, even my term I am using is not looking into organ meats, generally known as ""offal""). So we end up with some people whom are not vegetarians in the sense of the word ""one whom does not consume animals"".  As for the food additives one, some people have been lead to believe that going vegetarian or going vegan is a healthy choice. In the proper ways, it can be. But our culture is one built on making things more convenient, so that leads people to believe the kale chips and vegetarian chili are going to be healthy for you (or at least healthier than the non-vegetarian options).

Eating meat after it has died out will cause the body to reject it.  I think I read that on this sub somewhere but I can't find it so I might be completely wrong.  EDIT:    ""Also, your gut flora (bacteria & enzymes) becomes accustomed to what you eat. So if you eat mostly vegetarian for years and you all the sudden eat meat, your system is too alkaline and your gut flora not equipped to properly digest the meat."""

It wasn't a whole lot the ""chili"", but it was enough to have to throw away the fries if I wanted to avoid it completely, and I was a bit intoxicated at the moment so I figured why waste it.

I looked at what I just pulled out of my mouth and saw a pair of eyes. I inspected the noodles and realized it was full of tiny, almost translucent, shrimp-like animals. They were so hard to see that I hadn't noticed them at first.   It was very strange to go from not eating any meat for nearly 2 years, to eating an entire animal whole...eyes, legs and all.

I had some potato salad, which ended up having pieces of bacon in it that I couldn't really see. The taste, however, is unmistakable. I spit it out as soon as I realized, though I may have swallowed some.  I don't let it bother me. It's going to happen every once in a while when you eat out, and it's not intentional on my part.

I was about 13 years old and my oldest brother worked at a slaughterhouse at the time. It was a very tense household. It didn't really get better until almost I was around your age and I moved out for college.   There's a statistic that 84% of all vegetarians go back to eating meat after a few years. I think a lot of the reasoning behind it is because of the amount of crap we get from our friends and family. Yes, you can engage them in a debate, but if you're outnumbered, you'll never win. It's just easier to ignore them and do your own thing. I know it sounds trite, but don't let them get to you. If they know they're upsetting you, it probably just makes it more fun for them.  All of that said, I was at Sunday breakfast with my family this past week and somebody passed the bacon to me and asked me if I wanted any. 25 years and it still happens to me. At some point, you just have to let it roll off your back and don't get too upset about it. People are jerks and there's not much you can do to change that.

I can provide sources later if desired, but for example: Vegetarians on average live ten years longer, are 32% less likely to get heart disease, lowers your risk for diabetes,  lowers your risk for cancer, and honestly a lot more. All that is true of course if you're being healthy (making sure to get all your nutrients and needs). I mainly became veg for moral side so I would defend a lot with that and usually get less of a response.

For some it's phase, for some it's difficult especially when you want to eat out and there's not a lot of choice or everyone wants to go to KFC.

And then there's meals where it's easy to omit the meat or substitute it for something else - stir fry, pasta bolognese, curry and paella  My girlfriend isn't vegetarian so I tend to do what my mum used to do when cooking and cook us dishes we can both eat, sometimes she'll have a vegetarian meal sometimes I'll cook us the same thing but in 2 pans so I can do a meat dish and one without."

My suggestions for high cal foods: Juice or other sugary drinks, mac and cheese (other full fat dairy products are also good), protein powder, oils and nuts (add an extra tablespoon of olive oil to your meals for instance).  I think it also helps to snack throughout the day.  Have a cup of granola and some yogurt, or an apple with nut butter, or some cheese and crackers between meals.

vegetarian,3b5486,IDGAFsorry,20,Fri Jun 26 09:12:16 2015 UTC,"A) seitan/tofu/quorn/morningstar etc. I can't convince you of the taste but I find that people often write this stuff off because they expect it to be an exact replica of bacon, etc - it's not, it has its own flavors but they are really delicious. I find meat tastes pretty blah unless you season it - which is basically the same thing you would do if you made a veggie burger, you are just subbing beans/quinoa for the base as opposed to beef.  b. I've seen tofu, seitan, tempeh, quorn, morningstar etc at basically every major grocery store. It's harder to find at restaurants, but in those cases you just get a vegetarian dish. You aren't going to fall over and die because you had a humid sandwich or salad for lunch and it didn't have a meat substitute.  c. Beans, lentils, quinoa, quorn and especially seitan all have a ton of protein. There are plenty of active vegans and vegan body builders so this is just you making an excuse.  e.) The 'soy causes extra estrogen production' is also false. You would have to ingest so much extra for it to remotely affect your body - just look for some scientific studies about it. You are probably getting more estrogen from plastic than you would from soy. If it scares you that much seitan and quorn are completely soy free.  e.) I cook almost all of my meals in under 30 minutes. In fact usually this stuff takes way less time to prepare because it doesn't actually need to be cooked, just heated. With the exceptions of homemade veggie burgers and tofu dishes which take slightly longer to prep but can easily be cooked in <10 minutes.  You don't have to go completely vegetarian, but just cutting sheen on your level of meat consumption helps. Usually I find when people say ""oh I can't because X,Y,Z"" it actually means ""I won't."" Is it easy to do? No. It takes a lot of thought and conscientious effort to plan your meals and think about what you are doing. It's much easier to say "" screw it that sounds hard"" and just make up excuses as to why it's not possible. It's completely possible, you just don't want to.    Edit: I'm disappointed that the OP deleted their comment because of downvotes - it was applicable to the conversation and people shouldn't be downvoted for having a different opinion. My intention wasn't too harass them for their choice to eat meat but just to point out that sometimes we say that things can't be done when really we are trying to justify it excuses for doing them. It should just be a lesson to people to really try and research something before you say ""I can't because X, Y, Z"" and if you choose to keep doing it, that's fine, just know that it's your choice and completely within your control."

vegetarian,3b616l,owninobrien,10,Fri Jun 26 06:52:05 2015 UTC,"You're going to be fine.   Every vegetable has protein along with a range of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, so eat a wide variety of them daily and you will have good nutrition. If you're going lacto-ovo vegetarian, you can eat dairy and eggs, so you won't need to worry about protein sources at all.  The main challenge is going to be the intense focus you will put into your food choices at first. It's going to seem like you are spending so much time on your meal planning. But after a while, it gets easier and you'll put together nicely balanced vegetarian meals with minimal effort.  A easy to remember guide is to eat only the side dishes of a meat & potatoes meal: salad, soup, bread and butter, cooked vegetables, potatoes. Just skip the meat.  Pasta dinners are great for vegetarians. Spaghetti without meatballs, garlic bread, salad.   Make sure your meals have enough fat in them. Fat adds flavor and helps you feel full. If you're going from bbq chicken and french fries to steamed vegetables and salads, you are going to hate being vegetarian. Try vegetables in cream sauce and salads that have nuts or cheese in them.  Enjoy your experiment."

vegetarian,3b616l,mannyfresh79,2,Fri Jun 26 12:12:03 2015 UTC,"Whole grains are an excellent source of protein. Instead of white bread, eat whole wheat bread. Instead of regular pasta, eat whole wheat pasta. Seitan is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten which is very high in protein. If you're only allergic to peanuts, other nuts and seeds are good sources of protein. And of course, if you're not going vegan, eggs and dairy have tons of protein (though if you decide to pursue this long-term and are concerned about animal cruelty, I encourage you to learn about the egg and dairy industries)."

There are so many different plant foods available, and even if you don't like them raw or plain, all they really need is the right sauce to take them from boring to amazing. Whole grains, nuts (use almond butter instead of peanut butter), and some vegetables like mushrooms and broccoli are a good source of protein.

Sometimes these things start as an experiment, and it sounds like you have some strong foundational beliefs to work with, which will help you maintain your focus and determination.  Animals are very poorly treated, and if you're feeling like it's a little overwhelming at any point, check out other resources that are going to help you strengthen your resolve to stick with the diet and possibly lifestyle for as long as you choose to (which I hope is a long time) :)  Be careful about just substituting cheese into every meal or relying on dairy when you're cooking, because this could pose health risks and the industry is really not better than the ones that put steaks and burgers on your table.  There are plenty of tasty non-dairy milks out there, I personally like almond milk, and it has the added bonus of not having some pretty gross stuff in it that is inherent in the production of cow milk and cheese (in case you're still drinking cow milk, I'm not going to explicitly say what this is, but if you want to know Google will show you pretty quickly).  A great way to start is to choose a meal you want to eat - say shepherds pie - and search for ""vegetarian shepherds pie recipe.""  There's a vegetarian/vegan version of probably nearly everything you're looking for, and they're pretty tasty.  Have fun!

Some people are allergic to only one type, e.g. lima beans, but no other types.  Maybe there are some you can handle.  The other point pertains to protein.  The body has a way to save carbohydrates and fats but not proteins.  There's a reason for that, which is that if you are eating, you are probably eating protein (unless you are eating highly processed food like white bread).  I believe that the marketing of the protein (mostly meat) industry has cause us to be obsessed with protein.  Don't sweat it, you're probably getting plenty.  Ask your doctor if she/he has ever seen or heard of someone suffering from protein deficiency.  I promise you she/he has not.  It is unheard of in this country."

vegetarian,3aznhc,squeek502,26,Wed Jun 24 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"It's using U.S. numbers only. 9.5 billion land animals were slaughtered in 2007, and 9.1 billion were slaughtered in 2014. Unfortunately, it seems possible that this decrease is due to increased efficiency in the meat industry and not due to a decrease in the demand for meat. For example, the number of cattle has been going down steadily but the amount of beef produced has increased.  EDIT: I just checked, and it is down to efficiency. In 2007, ~9 billion chickens were slaughtered for a total live weight of 49 billion pounds. In 2014, 8.66 billion chickens were slaughtered for a total live weight of 59 billion pounds.

Gonna use it all for tofu.    You could probably toss some crispy tofu in with any pasta dishes you do. Sandwiches or tex-mex type things like Burritos are an option too. It's a pretty versatile ingredient,  it may be better to think of any recipes you like and then imagining how you can add in tofu.

Eat on a sandwich or just as they are with some veg and potatoes.  Also find a marinade you like for the tofu, and then once it is ready dip in vegan mayo and coat with bread crumbs (I use cornflake crumbs for this actually) and then cook in the oven for 10-15min.

I would say that treatment of animals with clear capacities for empathy, etc., should be held to a higher standard above say locusts, and that is not a matter of cultural taste."
vegetarian,3ayury,ColdShoulder,19,Wed Jun 24 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think empathy is the metric we should be using to determine ethical consideration.  I think it really comes down to capacity to suffer.  We should have more consideration for animals that are capable of greater suffering.  That's why we should have more consideration for dogs, cows, and pigs than we should for insects.    While this position is arrived at logically, it's definitely affected, in part, by ""cultural taste.""  For instance, the notion that non-human animals are deserving of moral consideration is a position that many cultures don't have.  I personally hold this view, because of the culture and ideas I've been exposed to, but admitting this doesn't change the strength of the argument.  It just stresses the importance of normalizing ethical values in culture and society so the children of tomorrow are raised believing that non-human animals deserve ethical consideration."

First things first, the sidebar can help with what was my biggest concern with not eating meat (protein), so you might wanna look into that. (If you're ok with eating eggs, this should be a no-brainer though)  Regarding cooking recipes, there are a ton of easy ones, I usually watch Youtube Videos for recipes just to take ideas and then make my own dishes, that would probably be the best start for you, but just some basic recipes:   Grilled veggies - Slice a bunch of different veggies with different properties, put them on a pan on high heat with very little oil and a bit of salt. Easy peasy. Just season them and it's delicious. Pasta with whatever - Cook pasta, make a sauce (tomato, veggie pesto, mushrooms&onions are my favourites), mash them together, don't forget garlic. Get some nuts - Put nuts in your dishes, they're all pretty great. They also help make some great sauces. Non-sugary peanut butter is an awesome comfort spread too and it's healthy. Nuts can also make for great snacks. Tacos - If you make a veggie sauté with mushrooms in it and put it in a taco, I guarantee you won't even remember it doesn't have meat.

I did notice a vegetarian MRE pack (meal-ready-to-eat) towards the end. However, I guess I was still ""old Army"" - ""new Army"" now, people get to keep their cell phones during Basic Training, hold up some kind of orange card if they get under too much stress and they get to go cool off. Which I think is not good for the Army overall, particularly Basic, but I guess that's beside the point. If they make a mistake like keeping a live round in their rifle unknowingly, they don't exercise until failure/puke/pass out on top of a fire ant hill, that's for sure. Never really liked seeing somebody get physically assaulted, but for certain things like that which can kill another person, it used to happen.  During my advanced training (the second phase after Basic) for 37F, in Fort Bragg, we were starved for about a week, then given live chickens and rabbits to kill. I remember they made the one vegetarian person kill two on purpose. I doubt the military is going to be vegan friendly, particularly this fellow's job as infantry, where the sole purpose of the job is to kill human beings on the whim of the elite rich/politicians. Maybe I'll be proven wrong though. I'm glad to see that he is proving it is possible on his own."

They're made out of mycoprotein rather than soy (if you're trying to cut out allergens, wheat soy milk and eggs are big ones, but easily tested for).  Two of my favorite easy meals to make are both bean based. The first is super easy, can of chickpeas and a can of white beans (cannelini works), pour in some tahinini, some dill, and juice of two limes. Makes a tasty zingy healthy Mediterranean style meal.  The second involves mixing black beans, corn, chipotle pepper sauce onions and cilantro. Cook for a bit to get the flavor worked in (you can sub the sauce for a mix of cumin/paprika/and chili powder).  Either of these can be thrown in a tortilla with rice, the first can be beefed up with hummus and veggies, the second with grilled peppers and sour cream and cheese if you so desire.   In a pinch, you can cut up a Boca burger, throw it in a tortilla with veggies and some sauce (BBQ or ketchup/mustard, teriyake marinade, etc).

vegetarian,3axja0,-Jaglavak-,2,Wed Jun 24 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"I stopped eating meats cold turkey about 3 months ago. I grew up eating meat as it was served daily for all three meals of the day. My bowel movements were so irregular that I nearly gave myself an enema 2 times a month. I took exlax almost all the time and i was getting sick and tired of it. After learning about all the harsh consequences of eating meats and all the lives im killing, I promised to change my eating habit for good. Ever since i gave up meat and poultry my life couldn't be any better. I move my bowels EVERYDAY now. It may not sound like a big thing but it's a huge deal to me. I feel so great knowing im not harming my body. Mushrooms and lentils are my new faves and they taste so good. I completely can't live without hummus. It's by far the best choice I made."
vegetarian,3axja0,-Jaglavak-,3,Thu Jun 25 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"I ate a lot of yellow rice when I started but I've now switched over to quinoa. It's got protein in it. It lacks flavor though. So when I cook it, I either put taco seasoning in the water or use vegetable stock instead of water. I tried cooking it with a few slices of lime and cilantro but that still wasn't enough flavor. But this last time I forgot so I've just been eating it with salsa and black beans mixed in."

vegetarian,3axja0,llieaay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"If you want to try out getting flavors and sides down, I find that a rice cooker can really help with getting a lot of the other cooking out of the way, so it's good you're thinking of getting one. Try to grab one that comes with a steamer tray too! You can get some white rice, brown rice, or quinoa going and then deal with the sides while it cooks and steams some veggies all at the same time.  To spice up the rice you can throw spices like turmeric or garlic into it, and it tastes pretty good with butter and soy sauce too. There are a lot of recipes for sides that use the three popular meat replacers: tofu, seitan, and tempeh that are pretty good. Try allrecipes as a decent starting place. I typically get canned beans and give them a thorough rinse (to lessen gas) and then put them into a sauce or something to go with the rice. If you're getting a good amount of rice & beans and a varied set of other things like tree nuts you'll get a good protein base going.  For added protein you can eat eggs in the morning (hard boiling takes a lot of the effort out of cooking every morning) with oats. I know that a lot of /r/fitness threads talk about vegetarian protein when trying to bulk, so you could always search there. Milk, cottage cheese, and other dairy sources will also be good protein sources.  Also, since you've expressed some interest in eliminating dairy and eggs later, the easier half of that is dairy in my opinion. If it's within your means, I'd recommend you grab a quart of soymilk, almondmilk, and ricemilk and give each one a try to see if you like any of them. If you find one you like it is a really easy way to stamp out your use of milk. Cheese is another issue - I dislike vegan cheese, but you can try Daiya whenever you feel like you want to make that jump (people say nice things about it).  As far as general advice goes, I think you should just take it easy and make sure you don't over-judge yourself. A lot of people here seem like they spin their wheels over mistaken ingestion of meat, and get very upset about the way the world is. I'm sure you've got some perspective given your experiences in life, so hopefully you can approach it compassionately (both for yourself, and for the animals if ethics are a factor). Just avoid pork though - in many traditions it's said that Gautama died from eating bad pork (that may have been poisoned)! :)  Try /r/Buddhism too if you're interested in Buddhism. They span tons of traditions, so it's not always homogenous, but that's a good thing I think. They also have vegetarian discussion threads, so you can see where your views fit into different sects of Buddhism (some of them do consume meat).   Sorry if all that is jumbled, but hopefully it's helpful  http://allrecipes.com/recipes/everyday-cooking/vegetarian/"

I have one with a steamer insert to cook veggies at the same time, which is really helpful - definitely recommend that! I think you can also cook fish in there as well, as long as you're sure it's cooked through.  You can also do steel-cut oats and such in a rice cooker if you want, which is pretty good for breakfast! I've also done quinoa for breakfast with milk and cinnamon, and that's good too (and it gives me energy throughout the day).  I eat a ton of eggs for protein, and nuts are really good too (especially as a snack - they're so easy to eat on the go). I haven't had any protein problems, and I stopped eating red meat/poultry/land animals about 8 years ago.  Good luck!"

I haven't eaten fish for six months or so; it shouldn't be too bad to make the change. Honestly as far as fish and chickens go... for cows, pigs (mammals, basically), I feel the compulsion to not eat them. A real moral pull saying ""don't do that"". Maybe just because they're a more recent ancestor or something. idk, they seem like they have personalities and all that shit.  Whereas for fish and chickens it's more logically reasoned out. As in, I don't really feel that emotional tug and probably wouldn't feel bad beheading a chicken, in my gut, for food. It's more something I've convinced myself, logically, is wrong.  But yeah, I think I'm going to quit the fish entirely. Honestly they just give me the shits at this point anyway."

vegetarian,3avi8a,Namaste_Bitchez,16,Tue Jun 23 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"I've been married for ten years and we still each have our own finances. I think that it's healthy to only have partially-merged finances -- each person has some money to spend on whatever they like. To use a stereotype (that happens to be true in this case), my wife doesn't complain when I spend my discretionary income on video games and I don't complain when she spends hers on fancy soaps.   That said, we have shared expenses -- a mortgage, bills, etc. That's where the finances are merged; we each pay a share of it. It doesn't really matter how you decide what the shares look like as long as you both think the division is fair.  Using this model, it sounds like meat is not a shared expense. If he wants it, he can chose to spend discretionary income on it. This works even better if you're the best cook in the house. My wife would much rather eat my vegetarian cooking at home than her own; when we go out, she orders meat."

vegetarian,3avi8a,dankney,2,Tue Jun 23 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"I should add that this also works with single-income families where one partner stays home with the kids. Both partners should still have discretionary income even if it's all from the same source.  If you don't have some money that's yours to spend as you please, it eventually leads to arguments about really stupid things, like complaining that the other partner spent money on a present for you. I've seen it happen.  I love buying presents for my wife and making her feel special, but it comes out of my discretionary money and not the merged budget."

I buy and make delicious meatless food and so far nobody has had a problem with it.    I would never dream of forcing my boyfriend to change his eating habits.   I wouldn't consider not buying certain things that you disagree with to be forcing your boyfriend to change his eating habits. Have a conversation with him about your reasons for not wanting to buy certain products and tell him that it would make you really happy to not have to purchase meat.

We are already on board with the partially shared finances: planning to get a joint account going for rent, bills, and an eating out/date night fund, but keep other accounts separate. He'll buy meat * and video games and puppy food. I'll get expensive tea and lattes and concert tickets. Everyone is happy!    though the idea of spending money on meat doesn't bother me (I already do, when we go out for food he'll usually order meat and we take turns paying for meals, so). More the thought of having to select which to buy at the supermarket, or having to prepare it once home (touching raw chicken, I just... shudders). But if we went shopping together and he picked the meat, I don't know of I'd mind if we paid from the joint account. However I also wouldn't expect to buy the fancy loose leaf tea I like from the joint account, since he doesn't drink tea, so. Will have to give this more thought."
vegetarian,3avi8a,TheIronMark,2,Tue Jun 23 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend is a meat eater, I have very specific dietary needs, including being vegetarian. We have partially shared funds, basically anything we both use or any category we both use. Generally I think that our budgets even out financially. If he wants ice cream or fancy shampoo then he can buy it in our fund because we both have the option of using it. I may not be interested in using the shampoo, but that's my choice. Similarly, I usually opt for vegan ice cream, which comes from the general fund because he can eat it too, although he usually opts for dairy I've cream. Ultimately, consuming meat is an option everyday for us.          If he wants meat when we are grocery shopping I feel that making him buy the meat separate is shaming and is unlikely to make him change it to help him see how I feel about meat consumption. Yes, realistically it would be nice if he were a vegetarian, but that's not my choice, it's his. He has greatly decreased his meat consumption since we started dating and that's great just as is!"

vegetarian,3avi8a,phubans,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:59:38 2015 UTC,"I do the vast majority of the cooking / grocery shopping and as a result, our groceries are pretty damn close to purely vegan.  The only real exception is string cheese and similar kid-friendly snack foods I buy since the kids are cheese-friendly.    I used to buy meat every so often and cook for my wife because I'm a really nice guy, but eventually I got to a point where I couldn't stomach it.  There are few grosser things than the smell of bacon or raw beef as far as I'm concerned.    It seems you're more worried about joint finances going towards things you don't agree with, and that's something you're going to have to come to think long and hard on.  You can try to play semantics games with yourself by keeping your money separate, but once you're married, that sort of thing is largely just for show - It's really hard to say ""this is my money / this is your money"" when you're married unless you're both bringing in equal amounts or you're both okay with financial inequality within the confines of a marriage, which sounds pretty bizarre.  What you need to decide is whether your money supporting the meat industry is a relationship deal-breaker, because if you are married to a meat eater, your money will end up supporting the meat industry in one way or another.    (Please do not read this as ""fuck your relationship"" because, as mentioned, I am married to somebody who has never even flirted with veg*nish diets or ethical stances, and I am in this for the ethics.  You can make it work, but it's mostly dependent on how you look at your relationship and the world around you.)"

Once it's boiling, you can also throw in a big handful of TVP (you can get it in bulk at Whole Foods in the US). The TVP will take on the flavor of the seasonings and be ""meaty."" It does absorb a lot of liquid though - I make sure I have a really soupy chili before I add it.

The enchiladas get a bit mushy, but I like them that way.  I wouldn't recommend using a lot of sauce or it might all disintegrate.  I also recommend getting a light timer to use with your crock pot.

I take after her in that we have quite a bit of empathy for our 4 legged friends, I think she just chooses to ignore meat production issues as it's easier then giving up meat and it's byproducts.  Also, I live in the UK where it's incredibly easy to be a vegetarian (a nurse at the hospital told me the other day that they get more and more requests for vegetarian meals and its starting to feel like the meat eaters are getting out numbered).

Restaurant menus are clearly labelled. They're working to pass laws to make vegetarian a protected food status so that if a restaurant menu says a food is vegetarian and then they fry some chips in the same batter as fish they can get huge fines.

It's not that they don't see the truth in it, but they'd rather not confront their own habits that may be directly linked to abuse because that makes them uncomfortable, makes them feel like the bad guy, and honestly addressing the issue would require a big dietary change for them that they're not willing to go through.   Sharing pictures of abused puppies, on the other hand, doesn't require anything of them except to share the picture.   It's something I'm sure we all went through at some point before becoming vegetarian. It's a willing blindness or denial that we allow because somehow our own convenience and pleasure are more important than the well being of living things.   And then there are the other kind of people. The people who try really hard to justify it and grasp for straws to illustrate why man must eat beast, even if it means torture and pain."

Given that most people don't care about animals at all I am absolutely thrilled whenever I encounter someone who gives a shit even if just a little bit. Even if it's just dogs, cats or dolphins.

If their logic is correct, then they would be okay with eating dogs if they were treated like pigs are supposedly treated.

Being vegan is about minimizing intentional harm. Just because we can never be 100% sure that our choices and actions don't cause harm to others doesn't mean we should deliberately kill animals when we don't need to.    The people who have to package the vegan food, or harvest it, basically slaves working for nothing, but yet that goes overlooked.   People have to package and harvest non vegan food as well. In fact most non-vegan food is more resource intensive than vegan food. What are you doing to help underpaid workers and how would being vegan prevent someone else from doing the same?   Ya know we have a delivery system for vegan food in Toronto - Mama Earth. They drive around all day to deliver food. No one sees the error in this. That's a full day of pollution 7 days a week, to a driver who is under paid.   What do you suppose people do instead? Grow all their own food? That would be nice but it's definitely not practicable for most. Eating non vegan food and eating vegan food both can negative consequences for people and the environment, but non-vegan food requires additional unnecessary animal deaths. It just so happens that livestock are a huge contributor to GHG emissions, so raising cattle for food is actually usually much more polluting than delivering vegetables."

Just try to be aware of the possibility of coming off as too mean sometimes though - people often get turned off by activists being too caustic toward them, since they usually already don't want to listen even when approached nicely.  If you're in it for the ethical reasons you can read up on taking eggs and dairy out of your diet by using replacements, because being a dairy cow or egg hen is rough.

vegetarian,3aqwx7,gazork_chumble_spuzz,8,Mon Jun 22 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. People here in the US usually react poorly when they see ""above and beyond"" abuse to farm animals too (which happens far too often unfortunately). The video of pigs still kicking as they were lowered in boiling water got to me when I was still a meat eater. That In N Out provider that was really abusing cows started a social media storm too. Not much changed, but at least there's some sentiment there from the people."
vegetarian,3aqwx7,koalaphysics,3,Mon Jun 22 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"This was my thought too. My initial reaction was anger that they couldn't see the connection  to factory farming but I've changed my mind. If the dogs were just being eaten for meat it honestly would be the same but this festival has a whole different level of cruelty.  I saw one picture where the dogs arms were tied behind his back and I don't think it will ever leave me.  I know this stuff happens here but as you said, it's not the norm."
vegetarian,3aqwx7,jacquiep,-1,Tue Jun 23 02:24:12 2015 UTC,Yup I get people need to eat but what they are doing is cruel and pretty sick.
vegetarian,3aqwx7,brokenangelwings,6,Tue Jun 23 02:38:43 2015 UTC,What is the point of these posts? Why is a subreddit for vegetarians showing animal abuse to other vegetarians.   It's like the bizarre tactics of Peta posting animal abuse pictures and stories to people who are following them. It just makes me want to unsubscribe.
vegetarian,3aqwx7,theyetithe,5,Tue Jun 23 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"I think posts like this are okay every now and then, just so long as they're part of a spectrum of different kinds of posts, discussion and more measured intellectual discourse. If the sub were to be all memes then it'd obviously be a low effort circlejerk, but the odd post here and there is healthy imo. I think on the whole this sub is pretty good about discussing vegetarianism in a measured way that doesn't become a self-congratulatory circlejerk, but every now and then it's nice to bust loose. The majority of us did make this choice for ethical reasons, and there is a huge cognitive dissonance amongst the general public around animal consumption. Sometimes it's good to be able to point such mindsets out, discuss them bluntly, and yes even mock them if they are deserving of mockery, instead of constantly having to find the best ways to discuss them mildly in an educational way without offending or patronising anyone."
vegetarian,3aqwx7,roobens,2,Tue Jun 23 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Now this one in particular is meant in a humorous way, but all the 'Footage from slaughterhouse shows pigs are horribly abused' links on here smell so self-congratulatory. Best case scenario it's an attempt to relate to the community, but we don't need graphic pictures or videos for that. I don't support that industry, that's why I'm here on /r/vegetarian, what else do you expect me to do?"
vegetarian,3aqwx7,arostganomo,5,Tue Jun 23 08:02:35 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I belong to a few vegetarian/vegan groups on facebook and they are constantly posting images of animal abuse. It's like... yes I know animals are abused.. that's why I'm vegetarian. I don't need to see this stuff. It just makes me really sad. I'd understand more if it was something we could actually do something about.. like donating to a local shelter when they need help. But I don't think that us signing a petition (for example) is going to do anything for the dog meat festival. And that just makes me even MORE sad because I can't do anything about it! At least donating to something makes me feel a little better! Sorry this got a little off topic. Lol. Guess I just wanted to rant!

But, much like how I feel the veg*n community needs to be sensitive in how it approaches the meat eating world, being combative does not help, nor does commenting about eggs and dairy on every post.   At this point it really isn't about trying to change minds or having honest discussion. It's about I'm right and you're wrong.  Your post and the posts about egg and dairy production are of course not against the new rules. But I don't believe for a second that they are honest attempts to provoke meaningful discussion in a caring and welcoming way. They are just repetitions of the same angry shouting match that has been going on here already.

In the context of this drama though, it seems like the vegan argument is ""we don't like seeing hypocrisy and we actually want to change minds because we care about the evils of egg and milk production as well as the evils of meat production.""  That's not how anybody is acting though, and to me, that is not at all what this reaction macro is seeking to do. I just don't at all see the way that many vegans are approaching this argument as a sincere attempt at changing minds and having dialogue.  I've never met a preachy or annoying veg*n as the stereotype goes, but honestly with the people coming out of the woodwork during this controversy, I no longer doubt that they exist.  I say this all as a vegan myself."

Which is why my image macro was intended much for the same purpose. Sure, it's controversial, but it is also humorous to me.

So I don't really care if what I say is controversial."

It's not a fucking competition, we each draw our own lines in the sand, but we're all doing a lot more than the average person. I think to a large extent this sort of attitude has to do with typical reddit demographics. Late teen/early 20s vegans are likely to be a hell of a lot more fire and brimstone intolerance, pushing their choices out there instead of the more measured approach you learn to adopt as you get older.

You still might not approve of that choice, but you can't deny those pictures have very little relevance when applied to this subreddit.  When the subject comes up, most vegetarians indicate they avoid caged eggs. Since many of us became vegetarian for ethical reasons, this makes sense. Those eggs are also banned in the European Union. Maybe we can have a poll here one day when the toxic atmosphere clears up a bit."
vegetarian,3aqwx7,mithrasinvictus,4,Tue Jun 23 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"Some lacto-ovos indicate that they avoid caged eggs.  Some say they try to, which has an unclear meaning.  Others don't say.  I don't think we have sufficient evidence to say that pretty much all lacto-ovos avoid eggs from caged chickens,  operations that don't cull,  and operations that don't slaughter chickens when they are no longer productive.   In my country (the US), it can be difficult to source eggs that don't involve battery conditions.  95 to 98% of eggs here come from factory farms.  Investigations have shown distressing conditions and abuse at ""certified humane"" facilities.    In this context,  it would be enlightening to know what ""trying to research"" means.  Since many lacto-ovo vegetarians use convenience,  being able to eat out, cost,  and wanting to avoid social complications as a reason for consuming eggs,  it makes me wonder how these lacto-ovos are meeting these goals and simultaneously only eating eggs from operations they have researched and know to be humane.   Of course,  not every lacto-ovo gives these reasons.  They're individuals.  But I am skeptical about your conclusion.  I think we have some lacto-ovos here who are very particular about the sourcing of their eggs and I think we have some who probably aren't.  We are just less likely to hear from the latter group when egg sourcing is being discussed. And there is probably also another group,  people who try to research,  but are also willing to relax their standards when in a restaurant or offered food with eggs in it."

It was fairly risky walking around bare foot as you'd often get chicken poo between your toes, but we had absolutely no snails or slugs while they were there.  They gave us about 7 eggs per week between the three of them. One of them just didn't lay, another laid fairly infrequently, and the other dropped almost an egg per day.

And our way of killing an elk is way more humane than what a wolf will do to it.  However. It's the unethical treatment of the animals we domesticate I have a difficult time with. And the impact convinent meat is having on earth. So I'm probably going to cut down on meat even more (I already eat very little) in the near future.

vegetarian,3auq0t,tbeysquirrel,2,Wed Jun 24 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"Because people object to eating meat and don't want to eat any traces of it, it's a slightly tenuous analogy but imagine you were suddenly in a world where cannibalism was the social norm, would you want to eat a pizza that was cut with the same cutter that had cut through human flesh?"
vegetarian,3auq0t,TheRotundHobo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"For me, I am a vegetarian due to dietary restrictions (I have gout). Too much cross contamination can give me a flare up that lasts weeks. I have found that most places don't cross contaminate much, and are safe, but I used to get Egg & Cheese sandwiches from a local butcher shop and had to quit eating there because they cooked the eggs on the same grill that they cook meat on all day long."
vegetarian,3auq0t,kegonomics,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:30:52 2015 UTC,I just wouldn't be happy to eat a veggie burger if it had meat oils all over it.

Decided on my own to be the only one in my family to take on this diet.   I honestly think that keeping everything you eat completely separate from meat items is crazy. Taking a piece of pepperoni off pizza and calling it a slice of cheese ain't gonna kill ya. Grow a pair of balls everyone. This sub makes vegetarians look like a bunch of little bitches. I'm sorry I ever came on here. Bye bye.
vegetarian,3auq0t,galvinb1,3,Wed Jun 24 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"When I was cooking I'd always run a 1/3rd of my grill as the 'vegetarian area' and keep that section as far away from the meat as I could, which was all you could really do in a venue with only one grill. In the real world of cooking there is inevitably going to be some overlap even if you're respectful and work your hardest to keep things apart.  That's why I choose to trust that people will do the right thing with the vegetarian options on the menu. Having spent nearly a decade cooking professionally I can tell you that more often than not you don't want to know what's going on in the kitchen, and if I let myself get hung up on the things I know that happen I'd never be able to bear eating out at all."

vegetarian,3auq0t,charlietakethetrench,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:41:27 2015 UTC,I think it depends on the place. I used to work in a place near a university. The place only hired students. We had separate tools with a different handle to use for veggie things and we took it very seriously to not cross-contaminate the food. This was from a crappy place and the people working there were normally hangover and didn't care about the job.    The veggie burgers where not cooked on the grill but we used special ones that tasted better if cooked in the deep fryer. The deep fryer and the area around it was a vegetarian friendly designated zone.

vegetarian,3ath89,Frank_IV,3,Tue Jun 23 11:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm cooking it so often.  Here's what it looks like : https://keep.google.com/media/1ANvcNX5ySKyqeIcOHDJytPIiRKHjBg  Let me give you my own recipe:  Intregents: (doses up to you)   Rice Onion Garlic Green,Yellow and Red Peppers Tomatoes Tomato Paste Mushrooms Green Peas Vegetable Stock Saffron or Turmeric   How to:  First you gotta soak your rices (on a slightly warm water about 15mins). Then put about 3 or 4 tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan. Chop the onions (one or two, depends on how many people you cook for) as small dices and mash the garlic (3 or 4 pieces).  You can put the onions and garlic into the pan after the oil gets hot. Wait until them gets pinker then put the peppers. More colors of peppers makes your paella look much more beautiful.  Fill a small glass with hot water o put your saffron/turmeric innit (both works aight) Now it's turn of tomatoes! You can put a lil bit of hot water into the paste and mix it and put it into the pan. Slice the tomatoes into small cubes and put them into too.   Dry your rices. They go in. About 5 mins later your little glass of saffron goes in. You need to put about 3 glass of vegetable stock into the pan and start boiling all of them until the water evaporate.  After water get evaporated, lower the heat a little bit and put shrooms and peas into your paella. You need the check it until the latest intregents gets cooked.  My advise is eat it with garlic yoghurt. Enjoy it!"

vegetarian,3ath89,Cholgar,2,Tue Jun 23 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"Hi there, first of all, Paella is a dish name not a category. Valencian people can get really mad if you call Paella a dish like this:  http://hotelvalonsadero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/paella-2.jpg  The original recipe of the ""Paella TM"" looks like this: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1QpvPXWSu90/maxresdefault.jpg  and its recipe is like this: http://www.lapaella.net/receta-paella-valenciana/  It has rabbit, chicken, rice, safron, beans, big beans (garrofon), and runner beans, tomato sauce.... For details check the links.  So with this seatled, you just have to remove rabbit and chicken from the recipe and you are set.   If you want to add some umami flavor you can swap the water for a veggie broth with shrooms or soy sauce or even add some shrooms to the recipe.  A good broth to add is a variation of mirepox with soy sauce and parmigiano crust cooked in the pot and strained.  Hope that helps and sorry for my english im spanish :)"

The meat and bread do sometimes touch the same surfaces, so be sure to ask for a new knife to have it cut in half and ask if the person making it can put on new gloves if that bothers you. Unless it is really busy they shouldn't mind.  Subway provides no information regarding the source of their cheese as far as I can tell, so wether it has rennet is a gamble.  But the veggies are all safe. No real skeletons in the closet. The cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions are all even cut in store. Everything else you see comes in a bag in the same form you see it out on the line. Everything is clean and rotated regularly, at least at the good stores.  Subway is pretty safe, but depending on how sensitive you are there are precautions to take."

This is what drove everybody bonkers, because the original thread was ostensibly intended to be about the ethics of non-vegetarians.  This isn't how it played out, and OP apparently didn't want to humor any other perspectives (read: vegan / strict-vegetarian) introduced into that conversation.   (It immediately went to ""this is not the place for that discussion"" before any arguments were made.)   Can we all agree that if you start an ethical conversation in this sub, you should expect that people with different perspectives might disagree with you, and that's not necessarily a problem with the sub or the people disagreeing?    Or (and this is where the question really is) is the new rule that people have to come specifically looking for input on ethics before talking ethics is free game?"

Snaquille mentioned this in an earlier comment:   I'm fine with you posing the question ""are you interested in the ethical concerns of eggs?"" If OP asks for more info, then by all means, share whatever you want to say on the topic. If they say no, then leave it be.   So I would put up a disclaimer like ""are you just asking about diet-wise, like foods to watch out for because they might still contain gelatin or similar animal products, or are you curious about some of the other ethical issues of animal agriculture?"" or something to that effect."

Also, as a mod you can edit people's post flairs, in case someone writes something inappropriate or whatever. I don't think this allows users to sort by flair, but it might be a good solution in the interim while the tag/flair filtering system is being set up.  Also, BTW...you're doing a great job.

If it's ""I just have so much trouble giving up cheese"" that's fine, because it's honest and presumably true.   Dismissing veganism and telling people to go to /r/vegan will hopefully be reduced with this change, as the environment that creates that sort of dismissal will hopefully be reduced.

Veganism is not just a variant, like triangles and squares are both polygons, but a subset--like how a square is a very specific type of quadrilateral. Being vegetarian in the US, where most of the subscribers here are from, implies you eat eggs and milk (and as a non egg-eating vegetarian, that causes some issues for me but that doesn't change the accepted definition) and if you want people to default to accepting  something more specific...well, that's why there's /r/vegan. To me ""variant"" would be if you could equally say that vegetarianism is a variant of veganism and I could go into /r/vegan saying that milk are honey are just fine all the time and expecting everyone to just be fine with it. If this were /r/plantbaseddiets I'd agree with veganism and vegetarian both being variants of that."

Eating a high calorie meal late at night could help to make sure your body won’t be able to burn the calories off so quickly.  Foods like nuts (and nut butter!) avocados, bananas, hummus are really good for you but also contain healthy fats which might help with the weight gain. Oils are fatty too. It might also help to consume more beans and grains, such as rice, oatmeal and bread.  Try drinking smoothies, such as this one that is around 1000 calories containing lots of fats and protein.

vegetarian,3as4o0,Energy-Dragon,3,Tue Jun 23 12:20:45 2015 UTC,"Gaining weight is just all about getting the extra calories in. Fats have the highest calories, so upping the intake of fat would help gain weight in a small amount of mass. Next to that would be carbohydrates, then proteins. Breads, pasta, potatoes, beans, nuts, seeds. These kinds of foods will help out quite a bit.  If you've got a hard time just eating enough food, like just eating more pasta or bread would be difficult, you could look into smoothies or juicing. You can pack a LOT of calories into a smoothie. Just take some bananas (each one has about 100 kcal), some other fruits like oranges or strawberries, maybe some veggies to get the minerals in (although if you use spinach, use baby leaf spinach. As spinach matures, it generates more oxalates, which are an absorption inhibitor. In layman's terms, it lowers the amount of minerals like iron you can absorb from the spinach). Blend that all up and either chug it down, or drink it slowly like you would coffee or tea."

It has recipes for every occasion, mood and season; diverse cuisines too. Often, I use the book for ideas and just replace things that I can't get hold of/ adapt to fit my preference.  Something I found when going vegetarian and vegan: meat substitutes never lived up to the real thing and that discouraged me at first. Instead I look for cuisines and recipes that were always intended to be veg*n, they always end up tasting better."

The soil in your backyard doesn't have B12.    You can actually get enough B12 to cure deficiency if you extract it from the feces of people who eat high fiber diets and ingest it.  The problem is absorption.  You can't absorb B12 in the large intestines (it's absorbed in the small intestines), but that's where it's produced.   it occurred to me that the B12 is created bacteria from animals internal organs.    What?  No.  Bacteria live in the rumen (basically a large fermentation vat) in ruminants (cows, sheep, goats, bison; animals with a rumen).  They ferment fiber into short chain saturated fatty acids (what a cow actually absorbs for it's calories), B12 and various other nutrients.  Humans have a very different digestive system and therefore need to ingest Vitamin B12 (or have a shot)."
vegetarian,3aqkh7,billsil,4,Mon Jun 22 19:33:04 2015 UTC,Here is a site that sells injectable B vitamins for livestock: https://www.valleyvet.com/c/livestock-supplies/cattle-health/cattle-injectable-vitamins.html  And an article about mineral deficiencies in sheep and cattle by a livestock group: http://www.vff.org.au/vff/documents/factsheet_livestock_traceminerals.pdf  If you google manuals about mineral supplementation of livestock from farming sites you find some pretty good information. Not exactly an exciting read but informative.
vegetarian,3aqkh7,skulloflugosi,2,Mon Jun 22 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Here's a lot of info on B12: http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vitaminb12  But, in short, even many meat eaters get B12 deficiency (I know at least two personally and it's nothing you want to go through). B12 supplements are generally recommended for people over 50, those who drink alcohol heavily, people with digestive issues, and those who eat plant-based diets. There is some B12 in dairy and eggs, so vegetarians who include these in their diets will still get some from that and whatever fortified foods they eat, but I suspect in many cases that that only slows down deficiency and for many people isn't enough to keep B12 levels from dropping. The body can store B12 for years, so IF you start with high levels, you might not have a problem for a very long time. But, unless you're tested regularly, you may not know when you become deficient. Some of the symptoms may not be obvious, either. In the case of the people I knew, they had memory issues that were first dismissed as just being overtired or overstressed, or then ""getting older"". It also raises the risk of heart problems, depression, and permanent nerve damage.    As for other species, different species have different habits and digestive systems. We do have the bacteria that make B12, but they are too far down our digestive system. It's made past the point where we absorb it. Some species engage in coprophagia. They literally eat their poop. Many animals orally clean themselves or otherwise ingest a decent amount of feces. Others have different digestive systems. Or they eat animals, including insects (whether as a main part of their diet or through accidental ingestion). There may also be at least some B12 in the environment, such as in unfiltered water where animals like fish poop.   We humans tend to live much more sanitary lifestyles and eating a little bit of dirt on our food isn't going to compensate for the lack of poo in our diet. Nor should we sacrifice hygiene for B12. Our species evolved the have large brains and for me taking a B12 supplement is a ""natural"" choice in the same way that it is natural for our species to wear clothes and make fires.       Disclaimer: not a doc."

The idea that cows are naturally deficient in vitamin B12 seems odd.   I think maybe the source of this idea is that B12 is added to many food items. This can be trivially confirmed by, say, looking at the side of a Cheerios or Lucky Charms box."

vegetarian,3aqkh7,Arthellia,4,Mon Jun 22 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, it's added as a supplement to lots of things. It's not like vitamin B12 naturally occurs in sugar water."

vegetarian,3amds8,janewashington,3,Mon Jun 22 10:49:56 2015 UTC,"They're not ""our"" standards.  I honestly think the vast majority of vegetarians would agree that milk & eggs are abusive and exploitative if they visited a factory farm producing dairy and eggs and saw the conditions with their own 2 eyes.  I mean... how is it not considered abusive & exploitative to grind up male chicks alive, and sell off male calves for veal... not to mention all the other shady stuff going on like keeping hens in battery cages?"
vegetarian,3amds8,steeltownsoliloquy,2,Mon Jun 22 15:45:42 2015 UTC,That isn't what I am saying at all.  Do you think vegetarians can't make posts without justifications for animal exploitation being involved?
vegetarian,3amds8,NatasEvoli,8,Mon Jun 22 02:41:11 2015 UTC,You're literally being down voted in a veg sub for saying we should criticize animal exploitation...
vegetarian,3amds8,veggiter,2,Mon Jun 22 05:18:21 2015 UTC,There's a difference between criticising and criticising constantly to the point where people can't take it any more and leave.
vegetarian,3amds8,jamecquo,2,Mon Jun 22 11:24:56 2015 UTC,"No, they're being down voted for saying that vegetarians exploit animals by choosing to consume dairy and eggs when that isn't necessarily the case.   I'm very careful about where I obtain mine from, and support local farms and businesses because if an animal isn't being mistreated to procure the product, I don't see the issue. And I'm sure this is the case for the vast majority of people on here."
vegetarian,3amds8,wakalixes,3,Mon Jun 22 07:27:09 2015 UTC,"I did?   I said I think we should critique animal exploitation.  Full stop. If the farms you purchase eggs and dairy from don't involve animal exploitation,  why would you assume anything I say is about you?   Given the difficulties in sourcing eggs and dairy that don't involve exploitation,  I am not sure I accept the claim that the vast majority of lacto-ovos are doing the same.  It's hard to find farms that don't buy animals from companies that sell for meat or cull males,  it's expensive to support males for their natural lives,  it's costly to support retired layers and dairy cows,  and it cuts into profits to allow cows to mother and feed their young.  Most farms can't afford this."

Holy shit, you guys, if I get a meat-eating friend to come to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant with me that is awesome because an animal didn't die for their meal! I don't spend the entire meal attacking them for their choices. Do you know how many lives we've collectively saved together?!  I agree that sharing vegan recipes on this subreddit is awesome and all news stories about animal welfare are welcome... but if you're commenting on posts to bother people who eat eggs or honey or milk then you're no worse than the trolls who come on here and comment ""bacon"".

This is the same mindset held in vegan communities. You are mischaracterizing many of the discussions - most people agree with you that attacking someone for getting eggs from someone in the backyard is absurd, but there is more to it than that.  The problems arise when vegetarians claim that eggs/milk/etc are ethical while simultaneously claiming meat is unethical.  The argument can be made that certain tiny parts of those industries are less immoral than any part of the meat industry, but that's a different thing entirely."

Being a vegetarian is a diet without meat, why you have that diet maybe shouldn't be a thing here.

Perhaps you eat vegetarian for health reasons, but it is a vast minority for whom ethics don't enter the equation. Would it be okay to ban discussion about the health benefits of vegetarianism (i.e. the reason for non-ethic veggies)?"

I wouldn't have a problem with that statement except that sometimes you see vegetarians who are that for moral reasons singing the praises of cheese/eggs from large chain restaurants, leather accessories, etc.  Leather is blatant. How it is considered ethical when meat eating (and particularly fur wearing) isn't is beyond me.  There is hypocrisy there. I accept the argument that ""free range"" milk is more ethical than factory-farmed milk, but if you drink factory-farmed milk it's going to be pretty hard to convince me that that is more ethical than the meat industry.  I accept the argument that free range rescue chicken eggs aren't particularly harmful, but it's going to be hard to convince me that supporting an industry that kills all of the male chicks and uses eugenics to create chickens whose entire body is devoted to egg-laying is better than killing one and eating it. Both examples so far slaughter the animals when they've reached the end of their short period of value."

It's almost impossible to completely remove yourself from animal suffering. Not saying you shouldn't try, but everyone picks their battles - even super strict vegans. Everyone who tries to reduce animal suffering is doing a good thing.  If a friend says 'I'm going to try going vegetarian a few days a week', then amazing. That's really good. It's a step in the right direction.  I myself, I'm a vegetarian. When I move out and find a place of my own with my bf we're going vegan together. Currently, I'm not vegan because my current living circumstances make that incredibly difficult.  We all draw our own boundaries. If that's local meat you know where it came from? Cool. Pescatarian? Even better. Veggie? Great!  I don't think vegetarians shouldn't be able to be criticised, but this is such a hostile place at times."

I honestly have no problem with people posting vegan recipes here or vegan alternatives to recipes that contain eggs/dairy.

Of the threads on /r/vegetarian, I'm saying I've only seen it brought up in discussion threads (e.g. Sick of meat-eaters being horrified about the eating of horses. That's a discussion thread, not a recipe thread). I've yet to see it on the recipe threads.

My biggest problem with people like that is they drive people away, they don't understand that they are having the opposite affect to what they think they are doing.

Empathy can be hard for people, especially when they are self centered or self-centric. So I tried to avoid aggravating them. It would be good to have a vegetarian sub where everybody receives support but I have seen posts like this four times in three months.

This sub is a pretty large hub for people who are interested in vegetarianism and honestly if I'd come here before I became vegetarian looking for more information I'd probably still be eating meat.  I really do wonder how many people come here, read the front page, see the bickering and infighting between vegetarians and vegans and the common dogpiles on people who still eat fish and people who are trying to eat less meat and decide that being a vegetarian is more trouble than it's worth.  Then there's the ultimate irony of threads that clamour that 'meat eaters are disrespectful to us' while we routinely show anyone who admits to still eating meat what it feels like to be on -8 points. This sub needs to take a good hard look at itself if it has any hope of being worthwhile at all."

I think threads like this are completely unproductive, and from what I've gathered, OP started an ethical discussion and then got angry when veganism was brought into the debate, as if that was an inappropriate time to bring it into the discussion.  As you've said, this sub is a larger catchall for different points of view and subtopics, but when ethics are brought into the mix, there should be some debate.  If those debates seem unwelcoming, then there are other threads to look at or even other subs, like /r/vegrecipes.   Instead, we have people complaining about being ""attacked"" when a different yet fully relevant point of view is brought up.  I agree with others that recipe threads shouldn't devolve into debates (though I'd be happy to see vegan alternatives being discussed there), but that isn't at all the motivation for this thread.  This thread is about someone whining because their viewpoint was challenged while they were challenging the viewpoint of non-vegetarians."
vegetarian,3amds8,janewashington,16,Mon Jun 22 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"I am a vegan, and I noticed that this was happening. I'm of two minds about it. I started as a vegetarian, and went vegan at my own pace. Actually without even consciously even realising it. So while I agree with many of the people that don't like dairy or egg production, I cringe at the righteous, preachy, and superior tone. I DO wish that vegetarian meant exactly the same as vegan, but I am encouraged to see any steps toward more of a plant based diet, by anyone, no matter how far they ultimately take it. SO, ""yes! agreed O.P!"" I hope some people will listen and respect you, but I doubt they will... some vegans are a shrill, dour, cheerless bunch. Weird for a group based on compassionate thinking..."
vegetarian,3amds8,I_want_hard_work,17,Sun Jun 21 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"Same boat!!  On the one hand, I hate seeing people being attacked when they are just trying to discuss recipes and do better for the world.  On the other hand, I was a long-time vegetarian (15 years!!) before I went vegan (1 year)... and I'm really appreciative of the vegan information and education that people provided to me.  My feeling was that it's wrong to kill animals for food.  Education forced me to realize that the dairy/egg industries ARE killing animals for food, and even if the route is slightly less direct, that's what it boils down to.  So it forced me to face my own cognitive dissonance.  I'm glad people were in my face a little bit, because deep down I knew but it was convenient to forget because cheese was delicious.  I have no problem with vegetarians who never plan to go any further, and I sympathize with their feeling attacked in their own safe space... not cool.  But for those who are sympathetic and need a little push (like I did... for many years)... Ahh!  I don't know.  Two minds about it."
vegetarian,3amds8,TarAldarion,7,Mon Jun 22 00:23:10 2015 UTC,If I wanted vegan information and education I would head on over to /r/vegan. A space exists for the vegan community and those interested in adopting that lifestyle.

I honestly don't care about the presence of animal cruelty discussions but to see people getting flak for sharing recipes with eggs is really uncool. People need to understand that being 100% vegan is a privilege that not everyone can afford.   And regardless of our reasons for being veg, don't we come here to avoid diet-shaming? As if I don't get enough shit from meat-eaters already. We're pretty much the bisexuals of diets- not good enough for the heterosexual or the homosexual community because we're in-betweeners.   Edit: When I say it's a privilege not everyone can afford it's not just on a financial basis. Culture, health, convenience, etc... And if you rely on another (like parents) for food but they don't support you it's tough shit.   While it's not MY reasoning for not going full-on vegan its important to understand that there's a variety of backgrounds people come from. It's best not to make assumptions about why this person is choosing that thing, therefore we should keep animal ethics out unless it really is about animal ethics."
vegetarian,3amds8,MaxisDiedForYourSims,8,Mon Jun 22 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'd just tell them ""I'm not vegetarian for ethical reasons"" and leave it at that then. But please, for the love of god, don't bring up the privilege argument. That'd be fine to bring up if you were in that position. If you're not, it's just a ridiculous excuse like ""well lions eat animals, so I should too"" or ""I have canine teeth, so I should eat meat"". If you don't care about the ethics of it? Just tell people that. There's no point in bringing up the ethics of it if the person hearing it isn't going to care.  I do agree the ethics should be left out of recipe threads if it's coming up there. If someone asks a question about the ethics, bring it up. Otherwise don't. People are more receptive of information if they ask the questions instead of being just directly told the information."

vegetarian,3amds8,bingosherlock,5,Mon Jun 22 06:41:11 2015 UTC,"No need to be so aggressive.  The argument that veganism is more expensive is also quite tiring. It's simply not true at all. Just like any diet you can spend a lot on specialty items, but it is not necessary. I eat a good variety of different foods and do not spend more than what I was an omni. Likely less.  And that is taking into account the heavy subsidies that most governments give to meat and dairy."

The facts are I will never be done trying to live more ethically, should I berate past me every single day? I don't think anything less of anybody make any effort at all, we all do what we an. I was vegetarian before I was vegan and ate meat before that. We all have our path and how much we can do.  Here is a good thought experiment on why vegans should not look down on others, ""veganer than thou"" http://veganstrategist.org/tag/hypocrisy/  Keep on doing what you are doing and trying to be better and we will ahve a better world, but it will come from compassion/empathy, not putting people down."

vegetarian,3amds8,rnjbond,4,Sun Jun 21 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that strict vegetarians don't consider eggs or dairy to be vegetarian, and they read ""ovo-lacto vegetarian"" to mean ""vegetarian except for eggs and dairy,"" not ""vegetarian because I only eat eggs and dairy.""  Vegans adhere to a strict vegetarian diet, so you should probably expect some friction from them on eggs/dairy, whether you agree with it or not, just like strict vegetarians should expect some friction when they try to argue that the ovo-lacto bunch aren't real vegetarians.    Friction is going to happen.  We're in a very vaguely themed, general topic sub that has very little consistency in viewpoint.    What you should keep in mind though, is that all of these people, from the strict, no-qualifiers vegetarians to the ovo-lacto-vegetarians, all believe that they are equally legitimate vegetarians.  That said, when you address the group with a vegetarian-related ethical issue and you get a response from people who believe your perspective is flawed, telling them that they're in the wrong for responding from their own perspective instead of your own is sort of flawed logic.  You're free to believe whatever you want and you're free to be as vegetarian as you want, you don't have to answer to anybody, but you're not going to have much luck trying to tell other people what they should believe or what they should consider ""vegetarian"" to mean.  However, knowing this, you were intentionally addressing the community as a whole.  You had to have considered that disagreement with your premise and arguments against your post might arise in such a situation, no?  And really, I'm not saying that you have to address everybody who responds to you, I'm just saying that immediately replying with something along the lines of ""this isn't the place for that discussion, go away"" isn't a realistic or effective way to manage a conversation that you started."

I see vegans being attacked much more often than vice-versa. I think people just don't notice it because they're like, ""Well, those vegans had it coming.""

However, those pre-prepared meals were kind of expensive, so I sought to make myself a ""substitute"" variation of all those meals. After looking all over, I finally decided to try this Butternut Squash Enchilada Casserole with Homemade Red Enchilada Sauce.   I mean, just look at all the FLAVOR in that sauce! As Guy Fieri would say, ""welcome to flavor town."" The only fat in the dish is from ~2tablespoons of oil in the sauce and a small amount of cheese for the topping. Didn't even sweat the onions in oil. And yet, after it all comes together you have a MEATY and hearty dish. Then I just portion the rest out for leftovers and save the rest of my enchilada sauce in the freezer. It is a great ingredient to have on hand--I can see myself making that sauce for the rest of my life.   Recipes for the casserole and  enchilada sauce. My own variation was to add corn as well as mixing it up with a few of the spices. I enjoyed the added corn thoroughly. I opted to go easy on the chili powder and left the fresh jalapeno out of the dish, and it was still plenty spicy. Following the recipe exactly would have been way too hot for me. I hope you all enjoy!   Edit: ALSO-- I should let you know that I almost gave up when trying to prepare the butternut squash. If you're able to find it frozen/precut in the produce section, that will save you A LOT of elbow grease. Make sure you have a good peeler/sharp knife (I didn't and it is horrible). Otherwise, this recipe is literally so easy and delicious, everyone should make it!~ ;D"

It's got a light, smoky flavour that adds a nice hint to these patties.

To match my results, blend everything together. Chill the burgers. Use a little bit of oil, and fry these suckers in the pan. Or bring up out to the grill.

vegetarian,3amhyo,IndigoBlue14,2,Mon Jun 22 06:10:48 2015 UTC,"All the bloody time. Here's one story...  This recently happened with my mum. I took her out for tea for her birthday, because I'm just a super mega nice guy. Anyway... It was during the same period that a major mining symposium was on in my town. I said to her on the way to her favourite restaurant that we might have trouble getting a seat due to all of the out of towners. We passed a Chinese restaurant during this discussion and I said ""well, if it's full then we could go to the Chinese place, almost nobody ever goes there."" Her: ""Oh, that's a nice idea."" Me: ""hmmm... I don't know if they will have anything I can eat on the menu, though. Maybe there's somewhere else we can go."" Her: ""why is that?""   Instant thought: ""oh god, here we go again..."" I've been a vegetarian for years now, but this always happens. Anyways... *internal sigh* ""because I don't eat meat."" Her: ""I don't eat meat either. you know I don't eat meat, I only eat chicken."" Me: ""... chicken is meat."" Her: ""no it isn't, chicken isn't meat, it's poultry."" I was about to say something. But then I thought, no, it's her birthday, I won't have this argument with her today.  This happens literally every single time we go out for a meal. It has for the past... shit, 3 years. I dunno about some people... It's stressful and draining enough being in a situation where I have to go to a restaurant or anywhere other than home. But it's worse with this shit on top of it. That, and having to eat a salad because it's the only thing on the menu without meat on it..."

Kaibab deer of article  Kaibab Plateau:       At the beginning of the 20th century, the Kaibab Plateau was witness to an interesting experiment in what some might call population engineering. The plateau's pre-1905 population of deer was estimated to be around 4,000. This number was never confirmed by any kind of count or survey, and has become an accepted number mainly because no other estimate is available. The average carrying capacity of the land was unknown, in part because this concept was not widely used by naturalists at the time. Years later, Aldo Leopold famously estimated that the capacity had been about 30,000 deer.

vegetarian,3amsm8,Wintersoulstice,2,Sun Jun 21 19:36:13 2015 UTC,"This is what I would say, because I've had this discussion a few times and it's one of the reasons that persuaded me to go veg. So, personally, I don't believe humans eating meat is fundamentally wrong. I do believe we have evolved to be at the top of the food chain, and we have evolved to be omnivores. This used to be my rationale for eating meat, before I went veg.   The thing is, just because we CAN, doesn't mean we SHOULD. This is when I usually bring in the environmental implications of a meat-based diet in the present day. We are not hunter gatherers anymore, most people in the developed world have access to plant-based foods that provide all of our nutrition, something that wasn't feasible for our caveman ancestors. Combine that with the fact that eating meat is not as simple as going out and shooting a deer anymore (for the vast majority). Eating meat involves supporting an industry that puts more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than cars, and is using up huge swathes of viable land to allow livestock to graze or to grow corn that is used to feed livestock. Meanwhile, millions of people still starve. If we could use that land for growing more plant- food products, we would be feeding the world a lot more efficiently.  So yes, I would agree with these people that we are technically at the top of the food chain, and have evolved as omnivores. But the planet simply can't support 7-billion-and-counting omnivores."

I thought the same thing but I don't miss meat at all. Like if I want a burger like thing I just need something to put there to replace that patty thing to put all my condiments and stuff on which could be a giant mushroom, or a bean patty or something, or sloppy joes made with lentils instead of ground beef etc. Chickpeas mashed up and used instead of tuna in tuna salad seems better to me than the tuna etc. Its not really as tough as I thought it would be and I haven't even tried any of the actual meat replacement products, I would imagine with those it would be even easier! Good luck! Give it a shot."
vegetarian,3alsr8,ssdivot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"I believe that some people cannot give up on meat, or rather it would be possible for them to become vegans/vegetarians but they would never lose the craving for meat. I find it easier than a lot of people to give up meat completely and I think it's because I ate a lot more vegetables than meat growing up, and could pretty much live without eating animals.   You could gradually cut down your meat intake day by day. Start with one vegetarian meal a day, then two, then slowly three. Eat a lot of vegetables. Try cooking your own vegetarian meals. Slowly you will forget how meat tastes.  edit: Another thing to note is to try not to make excuses, especially if you really are passionate about not eating meat. Search online for all the cheap, economical vegetarian restaurants/eating places in your area. Explain to your family and friends that you've given up meat, and if you really want to turn vegetarian, stay firm on your decision no matter what people tell you.   These are all my personal opinions and I don't intend to attack or offend anyone."

Maybe shore up your decision with some more information - there are some very good movies; Earthlings, Vegucated, Cowspiracy, are all often recommended; and then you may not have as much trouble removing meat from your diet because each bite will bring you some pretty strong and real feelings of personal participation in a system you probably don't want to be paying to be part of.  Once you don't eat it anymore too, the desire will fade away for it.  Eating veggies (careful about getting to reliant on cheese and eggs, since those industries are just as bad in themselves, with the slaughter of all male chicks in the one and the all-around nightmarish conditions that dairy puts cows into) will expand your palette, and there will be things you haven't tried before that it will turn out you really enjoy.

Vegetarianism is more often than not adopted by people who believe that it is wrong to harm animals unnecessarily, but are unaware of the problems widespread and inherent in the egg and dairy industries. This was the position I was when I first stopped eating meat. The lack of consistency within vegetarianism (DIRECTLY killing animals is wrong, but any indirect deaths such as male chicks and calves as well as deplorable living conditions and lifespans cut short when egg/dairy production diminishes is OK) means that unless someone takes it up as a fad diet or for a reason like that, you should probably be leaning towards veganism.  Having said that, veganism is a form of vegetarianism and so this post and similar ones have every right to be on here. You misinterpreted my comment if you thought I was saying that vegetarians are wrong, I was talking about the fact that many vegetarians will prop themselves on a moral high horse when judging the eating habits of carnists, but act in the same dismissive manner to people who eat meat when confronted with information about why eating eggs and dairy may also be wrong."

You take your loaf of seitan dough, and you divide it into pieces about the size of your fist, and you put them on a big piece of aluminum foil. You scrunch up the foil very tightly at the top to seal the steam inside, leaving a lot of open space for the steam to expand. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hr or 1:15?  The other thing is to let is set for a while after it comes out of the oven -- it firms up that way. I usually bake seitan well ahead of time, and use it in recipes the next day or the next week."

vegetarian,3al4zk,pqu,10,Sun Jun 21 13:23:41 2015 UTC,"It'll probably be much easier than you think. Cold turkey or slow transition is your choice, you could simply stop eating meat at once, or eliminate one course or day or animal at a time, whichever option you think would be best for you. Try different cuisines: standard 'meat and potatoes' American but with a veggie burger instead of meat, Indian curries with lentils or chickpeas, Chinese vegetable stir-frys, Mexican vegetable burritos, Middle-Eastern falafels and hummus, even Italian vegetarian pasta and pizza.  As for nutrients: you'll get some protein out of pretty much everything you eat. A few vegetarian foods that are high in protein are: legumes, beans, soy products, tofu, seitan, tempeh, faux meats, eggs and dairy. If you have at least one of these once a day, your protein will be more than covered. Do keep variation in your diet so you get all the different amino acids, and vitamins. Much more important to look out for than protein are iron (especially if you are female) and B12. One good source of iron is green leafy vegetables. You'll need to get a bit more of it than you used to because non-heme (plant) iron isn't absorbed as easily by the body as heme iron. You can aid absorption by getting plenty of vitamin C, and by not not consuming tea/coffee/milk/plant milk with or immediately after your iron-rich meal. B12 is the only thing you can't find in plant sources. You can get it from eggs and dairy, and in fortified foods or supplements. As you have eaten meat for years you currently have a big reserve of it though, so no rush in figuring this out.  Lastly, check out /r/VegRecipes for inspiration. And let me know if you would like some other, specific kind of recipe, I have lots bookmarked."

That said, the only brand of veggie dogs that achieves this is Morningstar,and for sausages and brats, Tofurky. The Morningstar corn dogs use the same veggie links and are also we received.   I've only been able to find them at Wal-Mart in the frozen section, and the tofurky brand at most grocery chains near the tofu in the produce section.

Oscar Meyer or a Ballpark Frank is about as close as I can place it taste-wise and texture-wise.  Drown it in enough condiments and the faint carrot-y taste will vanish.

vegetarian,3ak3vz,SnaquilleOatmeal,3,Sun Jun 21 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"With the balsamic method (which I also highly recommend), you can definitely just cook that on a clean skillet on medium heat until done. That gives it a really nice flavor as well. Either way, you're good.   The important thing with skillet / grill cooking a portobello is making sure they get their time to soak up the flavors you want incorporated into them before tossing onto the heat.

Pardon the ignorance, I've just never worked with the ingredient before and I don't want to accidentally under or over cook it.  With beef burgers I usually do a 1-minute sear on each side and then about 4 minutes at medium heat on each side. Obviously a sear isn't necessary on a mushroom (I assume), but would cooking a mushroom be comparable? Being able to cook everything all at once (obviously not in the same pan) would be mighty convenient, timing-wise."

It would have been a lot easier if the hosts just checked with me before going out of their way to make something that I don't like.

I think that shows a lack of respect, save for in less-developed areas of the world where eating meat is necessary to survive. However, I guess I would see it as the lesser of two evils if people chose to eat meat coming from animals allowed to roam, interact with each other, and given humane deaths as opposed to animals that live terrible lives of suffering, as is the case for the majority of meat-producing animals in the U.S.  At least that would indicate some semblance of empathy/respect, although you are right, still not much."

I say this as someone who is a cultural Catholic but pretty much estranged from the Church.  I can't be a part of it as long as this goes on.    That said, when they do good they do good.  Maybe some Catholics will take this as inspiration to go vegetarian or vegan even if it isn't official Church policy."
vegetarian,3agwkd,furiousxgeorge,-8,Sat Jun 20 09:33:23 2015 UTC,"There may be some things with homosexuals, even though no hate, although for transgender & women I don't see anything the Church said against them. Also, the main thing the Catholic Church has against homosexuals now is that it doesn't think they are able to build families for they don't fit in the standard man/woman model that was defined by Adam and Eve in the Bible, so I understand in some way why - but it's still not hate nor even a fight against them. I think most people on Reddit confuse the Catholic Church with some Protestant sects that are really popular in the English-speaking world who are clearly homophobic. They maybe also confuse Catholics with the Catholic Church, which are different things."
vegetarian,3agwkd,Sabrovitch,13,Sat Jun 20 10:19:42 2015 UTC,"for transgender & women I don't see anything the Church said against them.   The Church denies them access to the Sacrament of Holy Orders.  There is no reasonable interpretation for this besides that they are spiritual second class citizens.    Access for transgender people to Holy Matrimony is also restricted in many cases because the Church does not recognize a change from assigned gender.  The ban from Holy Matrimony of course applies to gay people as well.  Preaching that some groups of people are inferior in the eyes of God is hate so matter how you try and dress it up.  Exclusion is not what Jesus would be wanting his Church to preach.  ""Catholic"" means a universal doctrine and Church for all, it doesn't mean men pick and choose who they deem worthy."

And, to be honest, if you are to be a priest, you have to believe in Catholic traditions, which are tied to the institution itself. All in all it's still a two millennia institution, change takes time. I don't expect it to be the most progressive in the world, and such words from the Pope are always a step in the right direction. Rome wasn't made in a day, and the Vatican is in Rome. So no reason to hate this Pope!"

To misunderstand in today's environment is willful ignorance wrapped in tradition, rather than an inability to acquire new knowledge and understanding. Tradition does not excuse the hurtful, exclusionary language that the church espouses on a daily basis, such as calling such things ""sinful"", ""against God's creation"", and ""a defeat for humanity"".

Just because someone is the head of a shitty organization doesn't make their words any less shitty. I understand all the underpinnings that come with being pope, but that excuses nothing. I look at it this way: if he didn't want to put himself in a position where he is forced to say and do shitty things, he shouldn't be affiliated with the organization. Sure, there would always be another in line to take his place, but I don't find that particularly compelling, either.  Bottom line, though: ultimately this out of touch religion will become obsolete since it apparently is incapable of changing with the times."

vegetarian,3ai7ap,nicholew,9,Sat Jun 20 12:33:30 2015 UTC,"My live-in boyfriend is a picky omnivore. Here's how it works with us: I make my own meatless lunches to take to work. For dinner, we occasionally get take-out or go to a restaurant, or I cook a meatless meal for us. That means every lunch and every time he gets a meal from a restaurant, he can choose a dish with meat if he so wishes. I'm pretty sure he can handle a couple meatless meals every now and then.   Also, on an unrelated note it could be time for some tough love. You should explain to your husband that you don't want to be a widow/widower because he's abusing his body by not giving it the nutrients it needs (multiple servings of vegetables a day). Would you allow your child to not eat vegetables because they don't like them? Absolutely absurd and immature behavior that should not be tolerated if you ask me.   Ok back to (hopefully) helpful advice. I'm sure you know his likes and dislikes better than I do. Find out what he will eat and go from there. Or post it here and I'll give some recommendations. Does he like Italian food? There are tons of pasta/risotto dishes that most omnivores find delicious and would not even think twice about eating (gasp) without meat. Stir fries, ramen/udon, curries are good bets too. Meatless chili, grilled veggie fajitas (only use veggies he finds tolerable and douse it in yummy toppings).  Literally I could write books on vegetarian meals (and many, of course have! Grab a vego cookbook!)."

It's as big as respecting your customer.  They are likely showing other buyers that they can make a small mistake and that they won't be dropped....Sadly, animal abuse isn't a small mistake.  We're not talking abusing your buyer by promising someone a product that your buyer no longer has or makes here....We're talking animal abuse.  I really hope that they realize that.  It's likely also about profit.  These are likely the highest quality eggs at lowest price...and they likely make big profits on them.  So losing this buyer is likely not something they want.

vegetarian,3aert7,Godspeedingticket,19,Fri Jun 19 17:45:34 2015 UTC,The terms 'organic' and 'free range' can be pretty misleading at times.
vegetarian,3aert7,tzdk,5,Fri Jun 19 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"Organic is not misleading in terms of eggs or milk.  It's the strictest set of guidelines we have in America.  It means the hens must have access to the outdoors and cannot be raised in cages.  (i.e. free range and cage-free), in addition to no artificial growth hormones or antibiotics.  In dairy it's similar, although organic milk doesn't govern how the cows are treated as it does with chicken eggs."
vegetarian,3aert7,tattood,6,Fri Jun 19 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"I was skeptical, but it looks like you're mostly right:   On June 17, 2010, the Access to Pasture Rule went into effect for all certified organic livestock. This rule made it illegal to confine an animal indoors except during medical treatment, shipping or to protect soil and water. The rule does not specify, however, what type of outdoor area the animal has access to -- or if it even goes outside. While it's better than life in a cage, it's no assurance that the animal has room or opportunity to engage in natural behaviors.   Animal Welfare Approved is apparently the strictest."

From USDA.GOV:   Eggs marked with the USDA’s National Organic Program label come from uncaged hens that are free to roam in their houses and have access to the outdoors.  The hens are fed an organic diet of feed produced without conventional pesticides or fertilizers.

I felt right in replying that because she eats pigs that I don't really believe her when she vocalizes compassion for them (which was stupid and caused an unnecessary argument). . However, despite how you may feel and how unethical some people are (whether they know it or not), your feelings and other factors shouldn't stop you from coexisting with other people and being cordial.

You are not better than people living in a Mongolian nomadic tribe that eat goats because it is the only thing available to them during certain times of the year. Using the word murderer is a bit strong. I mean I'm a Smith's fan but you have to understand that the fact that you can be a vegetarian means you live a pretty privileged lifestyle and many many people in the world are not as fortunate as you are Vegetarians are not better.

To me, someone who is aware of animal issues, aware of environmental issues, aware of health concerns and still chooses to eat meat is very strange and I don't think it's unkind to say that having these views perturbs me.

Vegetarianism is a choice, one that typically means you live affluently enough to be able to make that choice   It's actually interesting that people who live in the poorest countries actually consume the fewest animal products.

However, I disagree that I couldn't feasibly disapprove of my own and others behavior, which wouldn't make me a hypocrite, it would make me self-reproaching. I've made the choice to stop eating dairy and hopefully I'll be able to do that.   I haven't said that I feel superior, I explicitly stated that I felt different. Recognising that people have different morals and levels of morality isn't the same as feeling superior and when it comes to morality it isn't cut and dry.

These things are easy to make yourself and quite delicious.   As for the meat-eaters, try and understand where they are coming from. 99% of the people they know say that eating meat is ok and violence against animals is justified as long as it's ""natural"" and we get something in return. When someone comes along every once and a while who questions that deeply held belief, it's human nature to defend their habits. Instead of getting angry at them, try to channel your energy into educating more people about the realities of animal agriculture and helping open-minded people make the switch. A positive attitude and showing people that it's easy and pleasurable to live normally without consuming animal products will do more for the cause than being bitter."

vegetarian,3a5onp,futureoldperson,13,Wed Jun 17 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"1/2 cup quinoa  1 cup water  1/4 cup bread crumbs  1/4 cup AP flour plus extra flour for breading  1/4 cup onions, diced  2 cloves garlic, minced  oregano, cayenne, salt, pepper to taste.  1 teaspoon Enger-G Egg Replacer (probably optional)  Oil for sauteing and pan-frying. I used olive, but probably would prefer something with a higher smoke point like safflower.  Bring the water to boil and throw in the quinoa with a pinch or two of salt. Reduce heat and cover. When the water has been mostly absorbed, remove from heat and set aside, stirring occasionally to dissipate heat (you'll be using your hands to form the balls, so you want to be able to handle it). The quinoa should feel like thick oatmeal, eventually.  While the quinoa is cooking, saute the onions in a little bit of oil until translucent. Throw in garlic for the final two minutes of cooking. Remove from heat and set aside and allow to cool enough for handling.  Mix the breadcrumbs, flour, spices, and egg replacer in a large bowl. Throw in the onions/garlic, add the quinoa. Stir until a kind of dough forms.   Tear off peices of dough and roll into a ball with your hands. Next, roll them around a bit of flour to evenly coat the outside. Set aside on a cookie sheet or plate to rest. I threw mine in the freezer for a few minutes to firm them, but that's probably not necessary.  Bring a wide saute pan to medium high temperature with a couple millimeters of oil covering the bottom. We're not deep frying, we're pan frying, so we're only interested in cooking a one side at a time. Throw in your quinoa balls and give them enough space to roll around (I was able to fit nine in my pan pretty comfortably ymmw). Cook until golden brown on one side, then roll over onto other side to cook. After both sides are beautiful, shake the pan a bit and let them roll around so they cook evenly around the sides. Remove from pan and place on a paper towel lined plate to cool. Enjoy!  Again, this is just an approximation, but I think I'm pretty close. Still, your mileage may vary. Like a lot."

vegetarian,3a8lki,henbowtai,6,Thu Jun 18 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"First you have to realize PETA straddles a weird line in most peoples minds.  The average person cares about some animals, but less so about farm animals.   There's organizations like the ASPCA that they agree with - they might even shed some tears at their commercials on TV and say, ""People who do those things to dogs are monsters.""  There's nothing culturally challenging about their message.  It's easy to agree with.  Then there's PETA.  PETA's message doesn't stop at dogs.  PETA's message isn't about other people abusing animals.  PETA is saying YOU are responsible for animal cruelty if you're participating in culturally normal activities.  Who the hell are they to be a moral authority?  I always compare it to the catholic church.  People love pointing out the harm they have done, the pedophilia scandals, hurting AIDs prevention in Africa, etc..  It feels good to know people judging you are really no better.  If you can discredit the messenger, you can ignore their message.  So, to answer your question directly... I'd say, ""They're not great, but nowhere near as bad as people say."""
vegetarian,3a8lki,taimpeng,11,Thu Jun 18 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. Not even close. Especially the ridiculous assertions about how many animals they euthanize. Those people citing that have zero knowledge of animal rescue, and the issues that shelters like the ones PETA funds deal with in areas with no-kill shelters. It means high kill rates, unfortunately. Blame breeders and people who buy breeder pets, not PETA.  Anyway.... my big issue with PETA is the way they use (paid) mostly-nude women to get attention. I hate it. I go to LA and have talked to these women. Most of them are just paid models and don't care what they're doing. They're just in body paint and holding a sign.  Edit: and my other problem with PETA is that they never debate with other veg*ns.   They have multiple representatives who post here and on /r/vegan but you'll never see a single one of them respond to any criticism from a vegetarian or vegan.  They will however debate non-veg*ns."
vegetarian,3a8lki,SnaquilleOatmeal,7,Thu Jun 18 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"They aren't the worst, in that I'm pretty sure they aren't a terrorist group (although they have been accused of it). There are definitely valid criticisms, though.   PETA shelters have incredibly high kill rates. PETA members have been involved in animal thefts.

Eco-terrorism is defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as ""the use or threatened use of violence of a criminal nature against people or property by an environmentally oriented, subnational group for environmental-political reasons, or aimed at an audience beyond the target, often of a symbolic nature.""  The FBI credited eco-terrorists with 200 million dollars in property damage between 2003 and 2008, and a majority of states within the USA have introduced laws aimed at eco-terrorism.   Critics of this use of the term argue that it has been defined in order to vilify environmental activists,   and that the term would be more properly employed to describe the environmentally damaging activities of corporations.

The dog is dead in less than 48 hours and there is security footage of the PETA members blatantly stealing it. It makes the national news.   Then they have other morons showing up at local festivals, schools, whatever and being dicks to people. Shouting at them, passing out ridiculously awful pamphlets to children (instead of fur is bad, it's ""Your mommy is evil if she wears fur."")

I would say to anyone that making some ethical consumer choices is better than throwing your hands up and saying ""I can't possibly not have a negative impact somewhere  so I give up! "" I also used to struggle with an eating disorder, and surprisingly being vegetarian has really allowed me to heal from that and focus on my overall eating habits and health. I fear that if I were to go vegan it would sort of thrust me back into that food obsession and constant need to control what I'm eating. Maybe that's irrational of me, but I so abhore the stress that sort of control over my food caused in my life that I really don't ever want to be having a panic attack over going to a restaurant with friends or being at an event (like a wedding) and not being able to eat anything.

I've tried cashew milk and found it to be more creamy and delicious, but it's not quite as widely available, and I seem to remember it had higher calories and was a bit more expensive, so almond milk is my regular.   Also coconut is great for replacing other dairy products. I use coconut milk (the thick stuff, in a can, not the replacement for cereal milk,) for a heavy cream replacement, besides already being great for curry. Most people find coconut ""ice-cream"" products to be great replacements for ice-cream. My sister's boyfriend owns a vegan food company and makes some pretty fantastic coconut based cheeses (in all different flavors, and you don't taste the coconut.) However, they are local and I haven't tried any supermarket cheese replacements.   As long as you find out which tasty vegan foods you really love, it won't be as hard as you expect. Cooking some or most of your food is almost a must, I would say.   edit: skipped over your comment about your sweet tooth. Get almond milk that says ""sweetened"" and probably ""vanilla flavored"" as well! There are ""unsweetened"" versions that you might not like as much."

However, I would not agree that I'm not doing anything at all by cutting back most of my meat consumption. I totally believe that you can be vegetarian for 'animal welfare reasons', because doing something will always be genuinely better than doing nothing. However, if that's your position you need to be mindful of how you treat people and the claims you make. For instance if you eat cheese but you get stuck into someone who still eats meat for any reason associated with cruelty then you're going to really struggle to honestly defend your position.  It also comes down to how you behave. Too often I see vegetarians scold meat-eaters for merely wanting to eat less meat but not wanting to quit meat entirely. That appalls me as much as when I see vegans nipping at the heels of vegetarians for not being vegan yet. We would all be a lot better off if we could all be supportive of one another no matter where on the spectrum we sit but it simply does not work like that."

vegetarian,3a63lr,janewashington,6,Tue Jun 23 02:27:26 2015 UTC,A lot of the vegans I see posting seem to be upset that somewhere down the line someone may have bought some chicks from a catalog or some other business that supports the chicken industry (where I'm from you can buy chicks at a store called Rural King). But I really think that $10 or $15 spent to start a flock of your own is negligible to the fact that you can start breeding your own chickens to provide eggs for yourself or your family for the rest of your life.

vegetarian,3a63lr,janewashington,8,Wed Jun 17 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Reddit, and it parent company, sells millions of dollars of ads directly to the meat, dairy and egg industry.  They own magazines directly related to those industries.  Every time you visit reddit you are supporting a company that profits from animal cruelty.  How you do rationalize that ethical choice?  You do it because it's so small, just like the $15 needed to start a flock of ethically treated chickens."

vegetarian,3a63lr,janewashington,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with viewing the ad. It's supporting the organization running the ad.

If you don't replace it,  you will soon find yourself without eggs (which is fine by me,  but confusing in terms of your argument).   If your argument is that it is okay for ethical vegetarians to support the practice of buying eggs and milk from people who purchase animals from those who cull males,  then explain why it isn't okay to buy from those who cull males directly.   What is the difference?"
vegetarian,3a63lr,prodiver,10,Wed Jun 17 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"Because spending $10 on a live chicken has way less impact that spending $1000 on 7 years worth of eggs.  It's no different than how you are rationalizing using reddit right now, even though by giving them pageviews (and therefore ad revenue) you are contributing to a company that profits from ads sold directly to meat, egg and dairy producers.  The answer is that the support is so small it pales in comparison to the alternative."
vegetarian,3a63lr,blargh9001,5,Wed Jun 17 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"Is the impact really that small? Millions and millions of chick are killed every year. Just because the responsibility is filtered through several people (you -> farmer -> hatchery) ultimately, it is consumers and only consumers that are providing the incentive to have this done.   Eggs have one of the largest deaths/calorie count of common foods. It's still relatively high even in the unlikely scenario that hens are kept and treated well after they stop being productive (higher than pork and beef)."

vegetarian,3a63lr,razzertto,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"I initially decided to stop eating meat for health reasons, and also because I didn't so much like the texture. Ethics was probably one of the last reasons. After a year of eating pescetarian, and keeping rather intelligent small animals as pets, things have changed. Now, ethics is probably the primary reason I don't want to go back to eating meat AND fish, because I just feel guilty that animals, even fish, have to die/suffer.   I used to eat eggs for breakfast, but recently (last week, after watching an upsetting video on the heartbreaking conditions of egg hens) I decided to switch to having apple slices with peanut butter for breakfast.   Dairy hasn't been part of my life for a while. I don't cook with butter, and I rarely drink cow's milk (once a month maybe)? I buy soy/coconut/almond milk, for health, ethical, and taste reasons (the dairy industry in my country is a little shady, and also, it's very common to find vanilla added to non-dairy milks, and I find that delicious.)   Basically, try to find an alternative to eggs and dairy. You may find that you don't miss it. Initially, I didn't think I could go vegetarian. I used to think, what the hell am I going to eat? Well, turns out, I now have a much more varied diet now than back when I used to eat meat and fish. After I tried it for a while, it was easy not to even look back at it. I think you may feel the same way after you find replacements for eggs/dairy. Start with figuring out where you eat these, and see what else you can do instead, like how I did with my breakfast. There are plenty of other things to have for breakfast in western culture, and in many asian cultures, their standard breakfast consists of what we would consider ""dinner food"" - like rice and pickled vegetables.   If there are things you really can't substitute (like baked goods*):  I don't know where you live, but I am in NYC and here we have a lot of farmer's markets weekly. Nearly every day, there is a farmer's market somewhere. You can get milk and eggs from them. A short (1-3 hour) drive upstate will get you to these farms, where you can see for yourself the conditions that the animals live in. You  may be able to find some humanely raised eggs from a small local farmer.   *I don't personally eat baked goods and never really yearn for them. I do believe that everything you love can be substituted, even if it was your childhood comfort food. Most of my diet now is completely new and totally different from what I grew up eating, and I have learned to love new dishes just fine. I was raised on home cooked Chinese food, and loved it, but was able to switch to the standard American diet in college/med school just fine, and then afterwards, was able to switch to a plant based diet without looking back. Good comforting food can be found in any style of cuisine, so I don't think you need to be worried that you can't go without something. Delicious food has been discovered in nearly every culture in the world, so there's gotta be something for you from cultures that don't use eggs or dairy. You just need to find it. Best of luck."

Yes, that means that my diet isn't entirely cruelty-free, but neither is the rest of my life. I wear leather shoes and every day I drive a car that harms the environment and displaces humans! I do what I can, where I can.   I'm deeply committed to eating 90% of my diet in real, whole foods and eschewing processed ingredients. That leaves little room for fake milks or meats (though, I've purchased these from time to time). So, I buy pasture raised eggs that guarantee the hens have access to 25 sq ft of outdoor space. I buy milk (rarely) from grass-fed cows. I purchase cheese that is certified human and organic. I put my money where my mouth is and go for higher quality ingredients over cheap.  I'm not interested in being a vegan. I tried it, hated it, and will never go back."

A lot of the options are because of the amount of Hindus that use that airline for business between India and the Arabian peninsula.   Also Japan has some awesome airlines. Or maybe they just seem that way because America's are abysmal.
vegetarian,3a59hi,XtianZzyzx,6,Wed Jun 17 09:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it's incredibly hypocritical. What's even more annoying is the whole moral panic about it, and the fact that certain people can't even seem to understand the hypocrisy.   In 'Western Countries' we have a certain meaning attached to dogs and other 'domesticated' animals, hence the whole panic about horse meat scandal in Europe a couple of years ago.   In certain countries like India cows and bulls are revered, and loads of other cultures and religions apply differing meanings to animals.  Hopefully, these types of conversations might help those uninformed to open their minds. Here's hoping anyway."
vegetarian,3a59hi,Frank_IV,6,Wed Jun 17 10:41:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's hypocritical.   But, perhaps it's a way to open up discussions around how people choose what animals are worth caring about and which aren't. Gently pointing out the hypocrisy in these campaigns might be helpful in getting people to look at pig or cow slaughter in the same way.   ""If you're horrified by this, then you should see what goes on in a conventional slaughterhouse"", or ""Did you know that pigs are a lot more intelligent than dogs?"". You can get the conversation started because they are the ones who are bringing up the horrors of slaughter, but only for a specific animal. I normally advise against getting into conversations with omnivorous people unless they bring the topic up.  I think these campaigns are good in general. There is an element of racism/ethnocentrism, but I'll bet the end result is a few more vegetarians out there where there would have been none without the campaign. The net benefit is that people may think about dogs in a new way, as something to protect from becoming food and down the road they may then extend that thinking to other animals once it sits on their brain for a bit and they realise that dogs aren't that unique.   If the goal is less meat consumption and animal cruelty overall then these small steps in increasing the public's circle of compassion seem worthwhile and something that we shouldn't judge too harshly."
vegetarian,3a59hi,Cornelius_Rooster,12,Wed Jun 17 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. And in addition, I frequently see an undercurrent of racism when people are talking about dog meat. It's similar to the people who want to ban kosher/halal slaughter because they think it's cruel, but who then ignore the cruelty of conventional slaughter. It's hypocritical, and it's also targeting a particular group on racial/cultural grounds."
vegetarian,3a59hi,tzdk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:38:07 2015 UTC,"While it is hypocritical, I would disagree about the ""racism"" issue. China is absolutely one of the worst countries for animals. They're singlehandedly responsible for poaching, and in this case they're stealing people's pets and butchering them. You'd have to be blind not to recognize that. And dog meat isn't a ""tradition"" — most Chinese people think it's disgusting — and the festival was started in the past decade or so by dog meat sellers to raise demand. So you can't compare to kosher/halal."
vegetarian,3a59hi,birdy111,8,Wed Jun 17 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"I think the point was that it often carries racist undertones/rhetoric - and the comparison with halal/kosher is coarse but often has similar tones in media coverage (although the practices are not comparable to Yulin).  The problem is that a lot of media focus is on 'China' as an 'other' homogenous group of people, and a lot of casual 'Facebook activism' (my own terminology) indirectly associate it with Chinese culture."
vegetarian,3a59hi,Frank_IV,3,Wed Jun 17 14:36:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that all criticism of China is necessarily racist, just that a lot of the criticism I see related to this particular issue does have a racist undercurrent."

vegetarian,3a59hi,El_Diablito,4,Wed Jun 17 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"People are upset, not because they are killing dogs and cats, bit because they are tortured. No animal deserves to be tortured. Those animals are killed in such a horrible way. Nothing deserves that. If those were chickens and sheep being crammed in cages, it would still be horrible.   All animals deserve the five freedoms of animal care.  The five freedoms as currently expressed are:  1) Freedom from hunger or thirst by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour.  2) Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area.  3) Freedom from pain, injury or disease by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment.   4) Freedom to express (most) normal behaviour by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal's own kind.   5) Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering."
vegetarian,3a59hi,MistyBlue2010,2,Thu Jun 18 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"If you also look from a different perspective about animals being killed and eaten, let's look through the eyes of Indians, who revere and worship the cow. But us here in America live off of the cow. Slaughter it, etc.   So the campaign is just picking at emotions. Sure, we like cats and dogs. But that's just our perspective. You can't just impose your ideas on everyone else.  Why don't we see Indians protesting the slaughter of cows in America on the daily???"

Green and yellow squash and peppers as well as eggplant are all perfect for slicing and grilling... toss them on a roll or over some greens and that is the perfect meal, and you still get that grill flavor.  For something a little different jackfruit is a pretty cool meat alternative that grills nicely.  It can be hard to come by but you can order it online, or it also comes in a can packed in water.  Jackfruit is good for a pulled pork alternative and there are a ton of recipes online!  I love sweet potato and vidalia onion slices on the grill!

vegetarian,39ythc,Lyzern,10,Mon Jun 15 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"Welcome!   Reducing animal product consumption is always a good thing in my books. Some people take longer to transition and that's ok. I've been vegan for about 7 months now and I find it extremely easy, so being vegetarian should be a breeze once you get used to it! At first you can just try some new recipes and see what you like without totally committing to anything. Chick pea salad is a great substitute for chicken salad or tuna salad (add some seaweed). At the beginning of my transition, I thought I would still have animal products every now and then, but once I completely gave up meat and took a look into the ethical reasons to avoid it, it didn't even look appetizing anymore.   5 recipes! That's a lot to ask for! I love black bean burgers, sweet potato burgers, stir fries, guacamole soup, all kinds of pasta, burritos, vegan pizza.. The list goes on! I've managed to find a vegan version of everything I used to eat when I are meat/dairy/eggs. Pinterest was a great resource for me to find new vegan recipes to try.   I do not eat dairy or eggs for ethical reasons. Laying hens and dairy cows are killed after milk/ egg production declines and their brothers who do not produce milk or eggs are killed right away. In addition there are some painful health problems (to the animals) associated with being milked/ laying too much, such as mastitis. Most dairy and eggs are easy to replace, as well. There are so many different, healthy options for plant-based milks, yogurts, margarine, cheese, mayo, and there are egg substitutes for eating and cooking.   Eating fish is extremely unsustainable and it is quite cruel, seeing as it is starting to become scientifically accepted that fish can feel pain. The fishing industry kills fish slowly and painfully, as well as killing other marine life like dolphins, seals, birds, sharks, turtles, etc.   You certainly don't have to eat tofu if you don't want to, but it is an amazing, versatile food if prepared correctly. Tofu scramble (it's like scrambled eggs but way better ;)) is one of my favourite foods. It can also be used as a meat substitute, but this one takes a little practice to be able to prepare it correctly. Nuts and beans and whole grains are good sources of protein. Seitan, which is a very versatile food made of some sort of liquid (I use veggie broth and blended chick peas), spices, and gluten, is excellent at replicating the taste and texture of processed meat and it is very high in protein. It's hard to make at first, though.    Forks over knives, Vegucated, and Cowspiracy are some documentaries that you might be interested in watching."
vegetarian,39ythc,bird_person19,4,Mon Jun 15 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, you and the other replier make some fair points but I'm not sure I'd be willing to give up eggs. Milk, mmmmmmaybe, since I like soy drink, so I could do that instead. But besides loving eggs and thinking tofu/fake meats(?) are a bit too extreme for me, all the eggs that I eat are from our chicken pen and we just let them do their thing, feed them good food (vegetables frequently), so I'm not against this practice.  As I stated on my other reply, I'm only against unfair treatment of animals, a swift, painless death is ok in book, since it's the cycle of life, in my opinion.  Also, when you meant stir fries, you're referring to stirred vegetables yes? Because I love that. Just confirming you don't mean potato fries."
vegetarian,39ythc,marijuanaperson,13,Mon Jun 15 23:16:57 2015 UTC,If someone says they are vegetarian I assume they consume dairy and eggs so you wouldn't be in minority of vegetarians if you choose to do so. Their seems to be some vegan crossover in this sub which is cool but not necessarily accurate to this sub reddit. I would suggest not trying to give up everything all at once. Transition away from meat as you figure out what works best for dietary needs and taste.
vegetarian,39ythc,bird_person19,5,Tue Jun 16 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, yes stir fried vegetables. I like to experiment with different sauces like sesame sauce, peanut sauce, bulgogi sauce, etc. Try to keep a bit of an open mind about the eggs. Of course eating backyard eggs from hens that are treated well are obviously not as cruel as factory farmed, but I think when killing a sentient creature who doesn't want to die, a better justification than ""the cycle of life"" is needed."

vegetarian,39ythc,samanthasecretagent,2,Tue Jun 16 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hey. I just wanted to point out that tofu does not equal meat. I love tofu for what it is and a $2.50 box of 16 oz. tofu lasts me two meals which is pretty good all things considered. I eat the stuff raw. I think it's tasty. You can sauce it up with whatever sauces you want or deep fry or lightly fry them, but usually I'm too lazy, so raw is great. It's not a meat substitute but I don't think it has to be. I like bean burgers for that but that's just me. I too have steered clear of the fake meats, and of the fake cheeses, because I don't find them necessary or in any way tempting. I, like you, am transitioning, and the hardest part for me is giving up the cheeses. It kind of makes me want to herd my own goats but that's a different story altogether, much like your chicken coop. Anywho, just came in to say, try the firm tofu. It's actually pretty good. This month I'll be experimenting with a coconut-ginger tofu and veggie stew. The chickpeas are a great idea for texture. Thanks /u/bird_person19!"
vegetarian,39ythc,brickandtree,3,Tue Jun 16 02:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only people who need to eat tofu are people who love or like tofu. There have been western vegetarians for many, many decades probably centuries who never had access to or desire for soybean curd cakes (tofu). Before tofu became a trendy health food in the 1970s or 1980s the only people eating it were those who loved Chinese or Japanese foods and maybe some Seventh Day Adventists. I think that since so many beginners seem to come to vegetarianism or here feeling like tofu is something they would have to eat just shows how much people still misunderstand where protein in food is and how much a person needs and how diverse what vegetarians actually eat really is. Protein is in many foods like grains and nuts but also in others you might not expect like apricots, green peas, potatoes, spinach, corn and sun dried tomatoes for example. Even good bread is higher in protein."
vegetarian,39ythc,samanthasecretagent,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:47:47 2015 UTC,"In that case nobody needs to eat anything in particular. I was just saying it isn't what people typically think it is. It is its own thing and some people might not like it the way some people don't like sushi. My older sister can't stand corn. I was just defending tofu from the stereotypical gross vegan reputation it somehow has. Anywho, you're right, I first came to love tofu through Chinese food. Really I was just trying to point out that tofu doesn't belong in the same catagory as the fake meats and cheeses that a lot of people like myself can't even stand the thought of."
vegetarian,39ythc,Cryovolcanoes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:08:00 2015 UTC,"Regarding fish being ""extremely unsustainable"" - there is sustainable catched fish, at least here in Sweden (available in every store). So if buying fish (or any meat at all) always choose products from sustainable sources."
vegetarian,39ythc,erin_marcella,18,Sat Jun 20 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"Hey! Firstly, I would like to point out that you do not have to go full vegetarian if you do not wish to, I'm my opinion, though I choose not to, obtaining meat from ethical places isn't the worst thing in the world. And if that's what you want, then don't let some stranger on the Internet tell you it's wrong. Just cutting down and having meat say once a week, instead of all 7 days makes a huge difference too! (Well, environmentally anyway).   Secondly, you should do what feels right for you. I personally do not eat any meat, including fish as I dislike the taste, the texture and the thought of eating an animal. I also don't believe I have any right to eat an animal because I could never actually kill the animal myself. I do still consume dairy and eggs though. I just choose to always be mindful of where my products are coming from (eg. Free range eggs over cage eggs. Milk from more ethical, local dairy farms etc. It is a little more expensive, but I'd rather pay more and have animals treated better).  In regards to tofu - you definitely don't have to consume it! There are heaps of other alternatives to getting your protein! However, I love tofu and there's so many different ways that it can be prepared to suit your tastes! So don't be afraid to try it out a few times to figure out what you do and don't enjoy! I can't stand silken tofu, but love using a firm tofu in stirfrys. You'll work it out!  Hope that's helpful. Sorry it's such a long post :)  Edit: I forgot to add in meals, for breakfast I like porridge, yoghurt, fruit salads - that sort of thing. lunches and dinners are more like salads, stirfrys, I LOVE bean enchiladas, curries, lasagne, pasta... you can make anything vegetarian if you want to."
vegetarian,39ythc,erin_marcella,4,Tue Jun 16 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your understanding. I think that's the path I'll take, I barely ever eat meat anyway, now that I think of it; I do eat a lot of eggs since my chickens lay so many and I also eat tuna, which I'll probably cut because honestly I only eat it when I'm lazy to cook. Regarding the milk, I'll probably take the soy milk route, I'm guessing almond milk won't be easy to find in the small village I live in.  Edit: Why are you apologizing for a long post? I should be thanking you even more for it, not ""forgive"" you for making me read."
vegetarian,39ythc,harafolofoer,4,Tue Jun 16 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"I prefer soy over almond, so I don't think that's much of a loss. Haha. But it's pretty easy to make yourself of you would really like to try it."
vegetarian,39ythc,beetbanshee,2,Tue Jun 16 02:37:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've thought about it a bit.  I would say find a specific goal and remind yourself daily why you are trying it.  When you want something sometimes you find a way to make it work or make it better.   5 on the spot is tough, but...   Eggs, fried or frittata especially.  (My goal has been vegan recently, so I miss this) Just made gazpacho. Despite Lisa simpson's description of it, gazpacho is a great summer dish Chili is really easy.  Beans and tomatoes and you're half way there.  I like portabellas, onions, and peppers Butternut squash soup is also easy... once you successfully cut the squash into chunks. Black bean burgers because, well, you can't go wrong   I eat this way because I don't think eating a black bean burger or a cow chuck burger are equal when you consider the cow's perspective.  I don't always think dairy and eggs are bad, but in large scale production I often find I don't feel comfortable with what is going on. Give us an update on your Exp and thoughts in a month"

Maybe I should just eat a salad done that way.  Agree with beans, black beans, tomatoes and mushrooms. Can't go wrong with these indeed, so many good dishes.  I will!"
vegetarian,39ythc,LentilBurguer,2,Tue Jun 16 10:21:13 2015 UTC,"Firstly I think most vegetarians and vegans welcome anyone's choice to reduce the amount of meat they eat by any amount, there is no pressure to do everything all in once go, you could just cut out tuna to begin with or only eat meat/fish once a week.   As for the transition I don't have any personal experience but many of my friends have recently turned vegetarian and they have no problem, one of them is a stereotypical meat loving, rugby playing mans man and he didn't think he would be able to do it but has been 6 months without meat now and says that he never even thinks about eating it when preparing a meal. One of my other friends very quickly became vegan and after a month or so told me that she no longer found meat appetising. So what I'm saying is I think it is easier than you expect 😊.   As for tofu, I have been vegetarian for 22 years and I only started liking tofu around 2 years ago. It is absolutely possible to never eat tofu in your life as a vegetarian. What I would say though is that meat substitutes or 'fake meat' are actually very useful and pretty damned tasty, it is of course possible to avoid them completely but in my mind you will just be limiting yourself because you don't like the associations they carry. Don't think of it as fake meat, think of it as you can still cook a lot of traditional western food by substituting these vegetarian soya/quorn/whatever foods for the part of the meal that used to be made from animals.  My views on diary are quite complicated, essentially at the moment I would summarise them as 'while modern dairy farming is usually unethical, I do not think dairy farming is necessarily unethical and so I consume dairy and campaign for more ethical dairy production' as for eggs, if you own the chickens and can ensure they have a good standard of living there is absolutely nothing wrong in my mind with eating their eggs.   Oh and I don't eat fish because I believe unnecessary killing is wrong frankly. I will try to think of 5 meals and put an edit in in a bit, but welcome to the family 😊."

vegetarian,39ythc,brickandtree,4,Tue Jun 16 10:16:11 2015 UTC,"How hard is the transition?   There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's not hard.   should I avoid this ""family tradition"" for the sake of possibly becoming a full-time vegetarian or should I cheat on these days because why not?   The question isn't why not, it's why do you think that a family tradition is important enough to cause that much suffering. Why should a hen have to die so you can celebrate?   I love cooking and I'd be looking forward to cook some /r/vegrecipes[1] , what is your top 5 vegetarian meals for breakfast and lunch?   You mention you like tuna fish, try making it the same exact way, and using chickpeas instead for a sandwich filling.    On the topic of consistency, what's your individual stance on dairy, eggs and fish? I know what the community's stance is, I'd just like to know your personal opinion, for a complete newbie, this would be a nice bit of info.   My stance is it's not okay to use animals. I have some rescue hens and I don't eat their eggs because I believe they are not mine to take.    do I really have to go tofu on this? I know almost nothing about this, but I just see it as some kind of wannabe meat substitute. Can't I just get my protein from the vegetable sources?   Tofu is a favorite of some people, some people hate it, sometimes it just takes a while to warm up to it. You don't have to eat it, there is also the processed fake meats, seitan, tempeh, tvp. There are really so many options now that there is no excuse."
vegetarian,39ythc,HenryAudubon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all your input.  On the chicken thing, it's not so much that a hen has to die so we can celebrate, I'm more on the side that we shouldn't treat animals in a bad way, but a swift, painless death is ok for me, it's part of the food chain, so I'm just bothered with the way people treat animals while they're alive, not so much that the animals die. Since I know these chickens are treated and fed well during their life and killed swiftly, I might consider eating their meat.  And on the tofu thing again: I reaaaally don't want processed or fake stuff. It's just something I never liked. Can I get my nutrients from basic vegetables only? Nothing fake, not that I have anything against processed foods (besides the health hazards some of them have), it's just that the thought of eating something that's like meat for the sake of being like meat just doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I'm just being picky."
vegetarian,39ythc,RabidFemale,5,Mon Jun 15 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can definitely get all the micro and macro nutrients you need to thrive from plants (with the exception of b12 that you will have to supplement in some way). You don't have to eat fake meats if you don't want to!"

vegetarian,39ythc,SnaquilleOatmeal,2,Tue Jun 16 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"The traditional Japanese and Chinese ways that tofu is made are very natural and can be made by one person by hand, even hundreds of years ago. In fact it used to be that someone would specialize in tofu making much like a village baker or cheese maker had a trade and shop based around one food. It only takes soybeans and a source of minerals to curdle the fresh made soy milk, bread usually has more ingredients. And good tofu is best used when it's fresh too."

It is absolutely delicious, even non vegetarian friends said it was amazing. I eat them with mustard, the combination is amazing but that is more of a personal preference ;)  The only downside is the burger's softness. If you are careful frying them, they stay intact until you put the on the bread. After that, things get messy. Squeezing the bread to take a bite makes the burger come out of the sides.  Other than that, it is perfect ."

Ease up on it because it will make you gain weight. Easy on the pasta. It's another simple trick to just eat pasta every night.  See above.  Also applies to rice. Some is fine. Every meal - not so much. Pick a ""new"" vegetable or other veg food (tofu, seitan, tempeh) every week and try it. Have a nice everything cookbook like Deb Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"" or Mark Bittman's ""How to Cook Everything Vegetarian"". Eat beans - lentils especially will fill you up, but all beans have lots of fiber and flavor and protein. If you don't cook now, learn to cook. Pick three different dishes to learn how to make - a soup, a salad, and a one-bowl dish like a veg chili or grain-based salad. Make sure you like them. When you go to a restaurant try the vegetarian dishes and look online to figure out how make a version of the ones you like best."

There are so many recipes out there and following the ones you can understand will get you better at cooking over a pretty short period.   To get you started, here is my absolute favourite chili recipe. Make as-is or sub-out the seitan for TVP chunks:  http://www.vegetariantimes.com/recipe/ultimate-vegan-chili/  I would start out by finding a good grocery store that stocks some of the more difficult to find items like TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein), seitan and other meat alternatives, and other vegetarian specific stuff. It seems you're from Montreal, so check out Antidote on Ontario St for really specific vegetarian stuff.   Make sure you look at the total nutrition of what you're eating because it's really easy to over-do the carbs and fat with a vegetarian diet. Pizza is still vegetarian, so are french fries, veggie-cheeseburgers, grilled cheese, and almost all the deserts you can think of. I'm speaking from experience! And... a lot of the suggestions below are for pretty unhealthy foods like quesadillas, burgers, pizza, pasta... It's really easy to get into the habit of cooking these delicious but fattening foods every night.   Invest in a couple good cookbooks. One staple cookbook is the Veganomicon which taught me how to cook better food from scratch. Another book that you should get once you get the cooking basics down is Isa Does It by Isa Chandra Moskowitz who co-authored the Veganomicon. Build up your library from there until you think you can tackle a recipe from Yotam Ottolenghi's Plenty and Plenty More. Once you can whip up one of those dishes then you'll be a pro!"

I also just recommend either checking out Amazon for the top rated recipe books or going to your local used book store.

If your short for time, pizza is always a great shout. Just remember, like that guy mentioned earlier, you can easily slip into the habit of constantly eating unhealthy foods.  I'm currently trying to get a healthy balanced diet, maintaining a healthy protein intake. I find researching meals helps.

vegetarian,39x336,Spelr,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"Lentils are really high in protein and quinoa is alright as well. Others have mentioned seitan, you can combine a bit of vital wheat gluten with beans, lentils, grains, chick peas, whatever to vary up the taste and texture. It really can be prepared so many different ways so don't give up early! I like to make bean balls with mostly beans, lentils, quinoa, and things like flax or hemp seeds, and add a little bit of seitan to help hold things together."

Milk and eggs I can give up with no problem, but cheese is my Achilles' heel. I've had the vegan cheese substitutes and none of them can touch the real thing. Fortunately, cheese is one of those things that's eaten so sparingly that I make an exception for it. Though some vegans would probably consider me a hypocrite, I still think my diet is definitely a big improvement over that of an omnivorous one. I feel like any diet that mitigates suffering and environmental impact within reason of what is personally tolerable and practical is a step in the right direction."

There are so many delicious alternatives on the market that the most difficult part of being a vegetarian is having your friends accommodate you at dinner, and avoiding meat broth.   But cheese. Cheese is another story. The general feeling I get is that there aren't any good alternatives like there are to meat and milk. There are some suggestions in this thread so I'll try them, but I'm not holding my breath.   As soon as someone gets a good solution for cheese, and even eggs, no one will have any reason to eat meat other than mindless tradition."

Ricotta can be replaced with ground soaked cashews and you lose out on nothing. I have only used vegan soy or alternative cheeses on my veggie burgers for the past year and I gotta say, they don't ooze oil like a slice of cheddar and when they're cooked, they're just as good. Also both are great in Lasagna.   There are plenty of good alternatives to most cheese uses. Swap out where it's convenient, and move forward from there.  I have friends with a goat milk farm, and they're one of the few reasons I still eat any actual dairy based cheese. That and Pizza.

As these things tend to go, nothing is definetly proven on that front, but people have done well on the regular (cheap ;)) kind that is found in drugstores for a long, long time, so just take one that suits your need, preferably one that has at least the daily recommended dose of 2.4mcg, because even if you have more, it's not a vitamin that's bad if you have to much of it. Other than that: meh.   If you take other vitamin supplements because of other reasons or you find them cheeper combined with other ones, and they have enough of it in them, that's fine too.  Do note that there are ones out there that are not entirely vegan, so if you think that's important, beware of that.

vegetarian,39vbib,wegsmijtaccount,2,Tue Jun 16 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"That is just nonesense.   b12 is not found in plant-based foods. This makes it very much a vegan issue.   The fact that omnivores also have shortages does not make this less so, on the contrary."
vegetarian,39vbib,lightergait,3,Tue Jun 16 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"I apologise if you've misunderstood me. I'm saying it's an entire population issue, such that it doesn't matter whether you're vegan or not, because everyone should be taking B12 supplements.

vegetarian,39vbib,wegsmijtaccount,2,Tue Jun 16 06:44:12 2015 UTC,"No, I think I did understand you correctly. You're trying to downplay the issue to make sure I didn't 'lessen the case' for a vegan lifestyle.  While recent evidence is leaning towards recognising subclinical shortages more, and perhaps the 'entire population' will do a bit better if they all took b12, the order of magnitude of the problem for the omnivore population is just not the same as it is for vegans, making it still very much a vegan specific issue."

It's an everyone issue, and people promoting B12 as a vegan-only issue has led to the general public using it as an excuse to not go vegan, and no one should facilitate that when it's not a reason to eat animal products.  Again, I'm not saying vegans aren't at risk, but I'm a little tired of hearing people go ""If you're vegan, remember to take B12"" when it should be ""Remember B12 deficiency is common now, take a supplement"" because the first one does way more unnecessary damage to the social community."

Turns out  they weren't, sadly enough. All the experiments failed. Quite miserably, actually, because that b12 can not bind with those enzymes you're talking about. We make them enzymes ourselves, they are made by our own body in our saliva and in our stomach, and there they bind with the vitamin, and a bit lower down we are able to absorb them.  It's a bit ironic, actually, that our body makes them, yet we have to have other sources like fortified or animal food and supplements otherwise we die because of the shortage.

It's been about 4 months now and I haven't felt the need for cheese in a while. My advice for you then would be to find a recipe where you can hide fake-cheese in it, but still satisfy the craving, and eventually work towards not needing it at all. Best of luck!"

You can pass off a vegan bechamel as something cheese-like for some dishes, and I have yet to explore nutritional yeast as an ingredient, which has been suggested to me several times.   The oddest thing is that after a couple of months of going dairy-free, I tried some milk chocolate. My mouth felt greasy and sweaty for days afterwards. It was not a pleasant experience at all and I realised I had normalised that for years. I also find I never wake up phlegm-y any more. We're not built to take that stuff. It's what cows are made of! Glad I worked through that barrier in the end.

vegetarian,39sogd,CaptainCatNipple,44,Sun Jun 14 11:23:22 2015 UTC,"So, over time the stomach bacteria/enzymes that helps you digest meat will decrease. That means that when you eat meat it'll be harder to digest and could cause some constipation, diarrhea, or nausea. However, I don't believe you completely lose the ability to digest it."
vegetarian,39sogd,tzdk,14,Sun Jun 14 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with tzdk here, but I also want to point out that not all people were created the same. Some might lose more of these enzymes than others, so you could range anywhere from completely asymptomatic to the above GI symptoms."
vegetarian,39sogd,Bardeen2012,3,Sun Jun 14 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"Uhm, there are not only enzymes but also bacteria which digest the food for you. They die if they don't get their specific food and that's the same in every human digestion system. But specific food is very vague, you could say that some bacteria are good for digesting that special kind of protein. So if your macros are similar to those of meat you have most likely no problems to digest it."
vegetarian,39sogd,Frumpiii,12,Sun Jun 14 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"When I was younger, I didn't eat beef for a period of about 5 years. (Mom was a little freaked out about mad cow disease).  I ate a burger one day because I wanted it, and I missed beef. It turned my stomach a bit, and I nearly threw up. I'm pretty sure it also gave me the shits, however, after that beef wasn't an issue.   I imagine that's how the body would react to any meat now that I'm vegetarian. Make me a bit ill at first, and just need to adjust to it."

vegetarian,39sogd,dukec,5,Sun Jun 14 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"After the first year or so of being veggie, I ate meat once or twice and got sick both times from it. I want disgusted or anything like that- I didn't mind. It's a simple matter of the enzymes and gut flora that you need to digest it.   For red meat in particular, there's a special bacteria in your intestines that WILL die off without red meat. It simply can't survive 20 years without. Best bet is to inoculate the colony by having light broths and soups first, but you definitely want to ease into it if you don't want to end up like me, with Montezuma's revenge during the Twenty One Pilots concert."

vegetarian,39sogd,a_giant_spider,12,Sun Jun 14 12:06:18 2015 UTC,"Gut microbiome does change with diet.   The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses.   too lazy to format the source: Diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome Lawrence A.

You'd have to get a group of vegetarians willing to eat meat for the study, which would probably be hard to do. But I don't think it's a stretch to say if your biome is tailored toward a plant-based diet and you eat meat, you'll be less able to digest the meal than if it your biome were tailored for a meat-heavy diet."

But when I went abroad and ended up eating a few obligatory not very veggie meals (e.g. soup with the meat taken out again) I felt pretty queasy for the next day or so. I don't think it was just the flavour, it definitely felt like my body saying ""what are you doing to me!""

I ate meat just fine for the last 7 years and felt fine, especially when I ate paleo and low carb.  I recently decided to go back to being a vegetarian and got a little sick at first from increasing my carbs, but feel fine again now after about a week.   Pretty much any major dietary change is going to take some time for your body to adapt.  Just take it easy and make sure you make changes gradually.

Maybe full blown vegetarianism isn't how you should start. Each of us has a different path and relationship to this (lifestyle? Dietary choice?), and nobody can tell you what is right for you. Maybe you could try going pescatarian at first, and slowly fade the chicken out, maybe eat chicken once or twice a week.   Learning to cook will help a lot. There are some ""meat alternatives"" that are quite similar to chicken (grilled strips, even chicken burgers that most people I've fed them to didn't even realize it wasnt meat.)

Also, hey, if you're looking into vegetarianism for the animals (or health, really), veganism is something you need to consider. Come visit us at /r/vegan!  Summer during high school is a great time to make changes by the way. You have time to look into recipes etc. etc. so that everything will be automatic when you have to get into a routine/pack lunches/etc for school.   These are all changes you can make overnight -- they're not as hard as people make them out to be. But if you feel apprehensive, I suggest adding vegan/vegetarian meals instead of subtracting specific products. This will get you used to cooking in that way instead of having you using specific animal products you're holding into as a crutch in every meal. Try breakfast for a while, then lunch, then dinner (or whatever meals you typically eat) or whatever order suits you. When I was going vegan I first got started packing vegan lunches and I realized how easy it really was and was fully vegan like, a week or two later.  Good luck! Let me know if you have questions."

vegetarian,39q026,vl06,2,Sat Jun 13 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"hah i was the opposite. Chicken was (and still is, obv) repulsive and disgusting for me. Beef smelled really good passing by the taco trucks and stuff. but ya, it's something you just get over. It wasn't really anything special for me. I was 18 at the time and I just thought, well, this is a really awesome thing and I really want to do it so I will. Having conviction about it makes it a lot easier. If you're convinced it's what you believe in for whatever reason, it's a lot easier."
vegetarian,39q026,LivingInTheVoid,2,Sat Jun 13 22:50:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what most people have said, but I advise giving yourself six months to transition, and looking into meat alternatives (they're really good for helping people make the switch), and vegn cooking. Starting with one vegn dinner a week and building up to all 7 is a good way to slowly build up your vegn food skills - whether that's figuring out what fake meats you like or learning to make delicious dishes from scratch.  Its also a good plan to find some nice vegn options that you can eat while out with friends - when I first converted there was nothing where I live, then BK started selling a Salad Burger, and it was a game changer!  Be gentle on yourself, and if you slip up, instead of feeling bad about it, think about what you could do to make it easier to stick to your veg*n diet next time. It's not as easy for everyone as it is for some, and even just reducing your meat intake helps save the planet and improve your health, as well as saving the lives of some farmed animals :)"
vegetarian,39q026,TheIronMark,2,Sat Jun 13 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"I used to love chicken as well. I just made the choice, then I selected a date. Since I'm an adult, I made sure to use up all the meat products in my house first.   Talk to your family about it. I'd recommend trying out some new tasty looking vegetarian dishes. There are a ton of great blogs with recipes. You change your thinking and then meat seems less appealing over time. One thing that helps is realizing that you aren't craving chicken or beef or whatever, you are craving a flavor, texture, or nutrient. Make sure you get plenty of protein, fats, iron, etc. Come up with ways to get enough crunchy, chewy, savory, etc."
vegetarian,39q026,Life-in-Death,2,Sun Jun 14 00:10:56 2015 UTC,What worked for me was just taking my time and slowly going for it. It doesn't have to be done in a day and if you eat chicken once in a while you'll still be taking steps from where you were.
vegetarian,39q026,PartlyHeaded,2,Sun Jun 14 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"I know everyone says that you should just stop, but personally I think it's a bit easier to start cutting down then stop completely. It gives you some time to learn some good recipes and find new things to eat. Maybe start with red meats, then eliminate poultry and fish. I like this little write up from zenhabits."
vegetarian,39q026,lil_buddha,2,Sun Jun 14 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Food cravings are largely a product of what you usually put in your body. Your gut flora that help break down food for nutrition adapt specifically to better handle the type of food they usually receive. They're also believed to trigger cravings for specific foods.   So it's not like you'll just crave chicken for the rest of your life. If you stop eating chicken, eventually you won't crave chicken."

vegetarian,39q026,BrainDeadUnit,2,Sat Jun 13 20:01:29 2015 UTC,"You've gotten some good advice, but I'll add to it and suggest reducing your consumption over time instead of all at once. If you're worried about cravings or not getting enough food, especially since you're young and still living at home, adopting a reduce approach might be a good way towards going full vegetarian, or even vegan. Seitan, tempeh, and tofu can all be prepared like chicken and largely taste like what they're cooked in, although tempeh often retains a nutty flavor. You might also consider lentils, beans, and nuts as good sources of protein. Good luck."

Read vegan food blogs (fatfreeveganblog, postpunkkitchen)  Get a few standard healthy meals, oatmeal for breakfast, apple and pb snack, veggie burgers, bean burritos, etc.  If you love chicken, try beyond meat chicken strips.

A perfectly healthy person has some reserves of it in their liver, but it's better to keep that balance up as high as you can, because if it's gone, it can do some serious damage. Plus, if you've been on a dieet like that for some time, you're bound to not have that much leverage left, so take those pills, they don't have to be expensive, and there hasn't been a single time recorded that a person has had any side effects of taking too much, and some people have to take over 400 times the recommended dose or have it injected when they develop a shortage (That stings a bit, I'm told, but hey, having a big fat needle in your bum will do that to ya)  How much of what you eat gets absorbed is a good question, but it's impossible to answer, as that is something that depends from person to person."

The Arabic term means ""pampered papa"" or ""coy daddy"", perhaps with reference to a member of a royal harem.   The Arabic preparation method is for the eggplant to be baked or broiled over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste.  Often, it is eaten as a dip with khubz or pita bread, and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is popular in the Levant (area covering Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria) as well as in Armenia.   A similar dish, but with mashed eggplants and without other vegetables, is known as mutabbal (متبل literally 'spiced') in the Levant but is called baba ghanoush in Egypt.

In addition to cheese and grape products, there are also particular rules about bread. There are also rules about cooking implements, so all pre-made food would have to be certified kosher.  Vegetarianism does make keeping kosher a lot easier, though."

vegetarian,39kxg4,beetbanshee,5,Fri Jun 12 15:14:07 2015 UTC,I'm not paranoid as much as I just read the labels and know what to look out for. If it says Parve then it's probably vegan. Parve is a form of kosher that doesn't allow meat or either dairy or egg (I forget which). If the allergens say egg or dairy or milk then I know not to buy it. Being vegan is way easier than it sounds haha

You should feel comfortable enough to know you have been true to yourself based on your knowledge at the time! Now you know about rennet, and as you keep learning you will find the rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper, and there are varied opinions on consuming many ingredients that are not animal friendly. Some of the info is current, some outdated,  Some opinion.For example white sugar used to be refined with animal products and now it generally isn't,  but there are many people who choose to avoid it. There are animal sourced clarifying agents in certain wines or beers, and unless you call the maker of each one and ask you'll never know. Anywho just to give you examples of how far this can go. Being informed is important,  but i find sometimes people are focusing on ""attacks or judgment"" rather than education and community which may be a big part of your anxiety about potentially making a mistake or not knowing something!  Just stay true to yourself and it'll be all good :)"

vegetarian,39kxg4,mikejoro,14,Fri Jun 12 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"If harm to young animals is your specific concern,  it's important to note the fate of male chicks and calves within egg and dairy production.  You may not be eating them,  but harm to these animals is a definite reality."
vegetarian,39kxg4,LanimalRawrs,8,Fri Jun 12 14:11:48 2015 UTC,I mean doesn't veal exist because of dairy? I imagine rennet is harvested from them to make more money. If someone eats dairy it doesn't matter if they eat rennet or not since it's not saving the calf by avoiding it. Maybe my understanding is incomplete though.
vegetarian,39kxg4,janewashington,13,Fri Jun 12 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. A cow must give birth about once a year to be used for milk.  Male calves are of no use to the dairy industry except for meat.  Some are raised for beef.  Hundreds of thousands,  however,  are slaughtered for veal.  There are documented cases of calves being abused and denied medical care.   Selling rennet as a byproduct allows a higher profit margin for those selling the dead animal.  But cheese made with vegetable rennet still contributes to the exploitation and suffering of calves (and older cows)."
vegetarian,39kxg4,LanimalRawrs,4,Fri Jun 12 14:36:36 2015 UTC,Ok that's what I thought. I mean I don't know the numbers but I assume cutting out all dairy intake for one day a week would have a much bigger impact than caring about rennet since avoiding rennet only matters for the marginal(?) increase in profit.
vegetarian,39kxg4,lillyrose2489,6,Fri Jun 12 14:48:13 2015 UTC,I would tend to agree with that.   But it's easy to eliminate both.
vegetarian,39kxg4,chrisjdgrady,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"If you want to be quantitatively smart about it, then dairy already has a really minor impact compared to meat in terms of animals killed. Like, one cow produces 60,000 lbs of milk or something. Personally your consumption would only kill one in something like 100 years. Eggs on the other hand are as bad or worse than meat, pound for pound.  Environmentally though, cows have a big effect on the environment, and chickens have quite a small effect. So it's up to your own reasons."
vegetarian,39kxg4,Gypsy_Heretic,3,Fri Jun 12 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Let's say a cow produces 21,000 pounds of milk a year and the average American eats 800 pounds of dairy a year.  That means a cow is needed for every 26 or so people.  But that doesn't take into account that it takes ten pounds of milk to make just a pound of cheese.  Once you begin to factor that into it,  hundreds of years sounds like a bit of a stretch.  Do your figures take male calves into account?   My numbers might be wrong,  that was just a quick Google search."
vegetarian,39kxg4,chrisjdgrady,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the 63000lb figure takes into account calves, but let's say it doesn't. Add one calf per year, say 3 years of milk production per cow, that's 4 lives for 63000 lbs of milk. Let's say 4lbs milk a week is ~208lbs a year, say 1lb of cheese a week, 520lbs more milk a year, so 728lbs (close to your figure of 800). So 86.5 years.  Your mileage may vary the more or less you eat, but I think it's fair to recognise that there's a really big difference between dairy and any other animal products."

I believe it's very hard for anyone to start their own chicken coop without buying chicks at least from a place that probably killed the males. However, some people are just trying to minimize the harm that they're involved in and buying from a small farm definitely accomplishes that, even if it doesn't eliminate it all together.

I've been a fisherman and have hunted. I don't do it often, but once every few years (hunting) and a few times a year fishing  (usually don't catch anything and I fish barbless) I'm actually going this Thanksgiving to try and get closer with my partner's father. As a NR and forestry major, I've researched both sides of the debate.  2.) Mead.  I make it and is my partners favorite drink. I'm  profiteering off the bee slave labor.   I'm upset that people will not be accountable for their actions. Because they want cheap muscle or a certain type of animal it needs to suffer is whole life. They won't acknowledge animal suffering or the industry needed to deliver a product. If I hunt or fish I'm acknowledging I'm a murder literally with blood on his hands."

vegetarian,39kc83,ichabodguitar,3,Fri Jun 12 13:42:55 2015 UTC,Weeelllllll.... The production of honey does necessitate the death of bees so that's typically the argument. It's a weird vegan that thinks otherwise...
vegetarian,39kc83,FionaSarah,4,Fri Jun 12 15:55:13 2015 UTC,"I don't consume honey, I just feel like the term ""bee slavery"" is a bit hyperbolic. I suppose I'm not a real vegan because I disagree with one of the things the term's creators said, but I just don't see it, at least at the local level. I was unaware that it necessitates bee deaths, can you please explain this to me? Wouldn't human stewardship of hives/swarms lead to more bees and not less? Does (responsible) beekeeping lead to more total food for the bees or less?"
vegetarian,39kc83,ichabodguitar,2,Fri Jun 12 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have a source for this, as I read it on reddit. But apparently before you buy honey, it has to be filtered to get all the bits of dead bees out.  I see it as very easy to replace in recipes though, there are plenty of different sweet syrups that come from plants. So why even bother with honey?"
vegetarian,39kc83,AbomodA,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:07:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I know you can buy unfiltered honey, and honey with the comb intact, so I wonder if it's like factory farming where the more ""economical"" processes are used and they result in bee death. I guess I have some reading to do.  I don't actively consume honey, I just disagree with this particular tenet of veganism (at least at a local level), thus my questions. I mainly use agave nectar, as it's far cheaper than maple syrup in my area and don't miss honey myself."
vegetarian,39kc83,ichabodguitar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently the more economical, larger farms sometimes kill off the entire hive for winter. It's more economical that way.  I'll be honest and say I don't value insect lives as highly as mammals. But bees do feel pain, they do die during honey production and it is completely unnecessary.   I've also heard about honeybees and bee farming being bad for species diversity and native bee populations.  For me, it's so easy to avoid... Why not just skip it?"
vegetarian,39kc83,AbomodA,3,Sat Jun 13 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"It's definitely slavery, you're confining them to an enclosed cage of your design and exploiting their behaviour to create a product.  AFAIK you have to regularly kill the queens to get them to create enough honey. They don't produce much and only really create enough for themselves so taking it is no good. I'm sure of the answer to if bee farming produces more or less bees, but that kind of very localised confinement can't be good."
vegetarian,39kc83,FionaSarah,3,Fri Jun 12 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"I understand that taking their honey is exploiting their natural behavior, but is a man-made hive more confining than a hollowed-out tree? If the queen is regularly killed, how would the hive function, as I was under the belief that they swarm around queens (and new swarms occur when a fresh queen leaves the hive)? Do the bees starve when honey is harvested, or do they continue to gather food and process it into honey instead of stopping when they have enough to last the winter? Maybe these questions would be better suited to /r/beekeeping.   I guess my issue with the entire concept is that it ascribes a level of psychological torture to the act of beekeeping. Can bees feel despair? I don't know, but I'm hesitant to group their perceived suffering in with that of factory farmed (and abused) cows, for example. I think it erodes the strength of our argument that it is inhumane to grow animals in confinement for slaughter, at least in the eyes of omnivores."

In this case, I say something like ""I eat healthier on a vegetarian diet.""  In cases where the person asking does not have a hamburger in front of them, I'll tell them it's for a variety of reasons - health, the meat industry, animal cruelty, etc. I originally went vegetarian as part of a bet, so sometimes I'll answer with that if I don't feel like getting into the above :)"

They probably wouldn't be able to find out without going through a major hassle, and I think it's more helpful to the vegan cause to not make veganism look suuuuper hard. It also helps veganism when you support businesses that are selling vegan options, so I don't think the answer is to just never eat out."

Avoiding those things don't really matter because my eating of dairy massively eclipses the animal suffering caused by consuming rennet, and for stuff like gelatin and animal parts used in beer process etc., I don't think it's a replaceable ingredient/part of the process.   I mean when I first started I really cared and I still don't like doing it when I can avoid/don't like meat touching my stuff, but I can get over it because that's small picture.

vegetarian,39l1sy,Acetaminotaur,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"I'm strict.  Chicken powder means a chicken had to die.  So no vegetarian eats that.  Rennet is equally as out of the question, with a little thought, even if the rennet itself is plant-based.  Dairy cows are slaughtered frequently, their calves are taken away and often slaughtered within a week, so eating cheese from a moral standpoint is indefensible.  Milk is easy to replace with the many varieties available; personally I like almond milk.  Bone char is harder.  Each person can only do his or her best, but if I'm aware of a product that uses it I will not pay for that product."

Some animal derived ingredients are by-products of the meat industry that I am protesting, and their use would not be feasible if it were not for those animals already being killed for meat.

I also don't take much action to avoid animal rennet--it's much less of a problem now than it was a decade ago, as 90% of current rennet is microbial (because it's cheaper anyway) so I don't really face the problem anymore, but if I do come across beef rennet I don't care. I won't eat roe/fish eggs because they kill the fish to acquire it, but I'll eat skittles and other candy containing shellac (wherein they kill beetles to get at it), as I don't have quite as much philosophical connection with insects as I do with mammals and other vertebrates..."

vegetarian,39hda0,bigoldgeek,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"""Full"" doesn't mean you're eating what you're supposed to eat. You could eat packing peanuts and feel full. Humans need starch/carbs in their diet as well. Your stomach is full of acid and, in some cases, bile and if you're not eating something that soaks that up you'll get sick — and throw up. It's the same reason that if you don't eat at all you'll start throwing up. Humans need balance in their diet — there's a reason for everything we eat, including maligned staples like starch, salt, fat, etc. If you're not eating enough carbs, the acid can and will irritate your stomach."

It certainly could have been an allergic reaction, but when I've felt that feeling it was because I wasn't drinking enough water or other non-irritating (for me, alcohol) liquid. Also, your stomach might be getting irritated by the leaves that stay more raw and intact.  Cutting them smaller may help, cooking them longer (if you're not a Raw Food person) may help.    And then sometimes, you just need to give your gut time to populate up with the right bugs.  Have some live culture yogurt (soy yogurt if you're vegan) and then eat your regular food.  The bugs that get fed will reproduce and your gut will end up with the right stuff to handle your new diet."
vegetarian,39eayt,BiddyCavit,24,Thu Jun 11 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"This comes up over and over on this sub (and similar ""why don't they get it"" threads).  it is an emotional response based on familiarity and personal impact.  That is all.  If some huge percentage of people had pet pigs and you saw people out walking their pigs and some seeing-eye pigs were in the stores with you and on the way to work you pass by an enormous pig park for pigs to meet and play, and if everyone had bag stations to pick up after their pigs, and every other picture on reddit was a pig saying I Can Haz Broccoli, then pigs would generate a similar emotional response to those same people.    In short, yes you are angry.  You feel a deep bond to something that you think should be obvious to everyone and it isn't.  This is how people feel when they meet others that aren't protesting another police death, or doing more about global warming, or risking our lives with socialism, or risking our lives with commercialism, or risking our lives with libertarianism, or any number of things.  For half those people we just don't get it and wonder what they are thinking.  For most of the rest, we understand their fight, but aren't in it ourselves.  It is only a few things we tend to get really worked up for and fight/defend as best we can.  It is hard to be a dedicated and consistent fighter for a cause.

Directly or indirectly causing animals to suffer is against my personal moral code, so I eat in a way as to not play any role in the cycle of animal suffering except to reduce it.  2.) I'm reducing the overall demand for meat by the number of animals I'm not eating each year. Along with millions of other vegetarians this reduction in demand prevents billions of animals from being produced only to suffer.  Edit: also I should note that people are behaviorally rewarded by making you upset. They get off on it even if they don't realize it. Explain the above once and only once, then ignore their efforts to drag you into a debate. Ignoring is the most powerful tool to strip them of reward for debating.

Coli if they eat enough grass and they don't get fatty livers).  I don't eat eggs because I have a problem with chickens being vegetarian fed instead of being raised on bugs.  I care about where my food comes from.  How many pesticides were used, the distance it comes, is the plant a monocrop or does it thrive with other species; all of it, not just the meat matters to me.  I haven't eaten a dessert (e.g. cake, ice cream, any pastry, a soda) in 3 years.  Why would you choose to do something that I think is unhealthy?  Because you aren't me and that's OK.

All the things we're talking about require change, which requires focus/learning/leading of some sort.  Now mix that with my values and somehow environmental savings comes out above animal life or prison fairness/abuse.

vegetarian,39eayt,horsenbuggy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't think believing that different species have different levels of intelligence, emotional needs, and cute-factors is tantamount to believing different races are different in all of those things.  A cat is different than a cow in about a million ways, and both are different than people in about a million ways.  A black person is different from a white person in an extraordinarily superficial difference on the spectrum of skin color made more arbitrary by the fact that some white people are actually sorta dark-skinned and some black people are actually very light-skinned.  But there are no cats that are sort of cow-ish and no cows that are very cat-ish. They're different.  All that being said, human nature is to protect what we feel familiar and emotionally connected to.  When it comes to animals, people build those constructs two ways: by spending time with animals and learning how they're personalities are OR by a gut reaction to animal cuteness (or general aesthetic appreciation).  This is a HUGE factor in conservation efforts.  Everyone loves tigers.  They're adorable as babies and beautiful as adults.  Gut cute-factor response.  Compound that with the fact that many people have had a pet cat and have ""learned"" through experience that cats have personalities, and they can transfer that feeling of connectedness easily to other cats, and you have one charismatic case for conservation right there.  Then you have, say, the Florida Scrub Jay. Despite huge efforts to raise awareness and get people involved in their conservation, most people have never even heard of them.  They aren't very pretty or cute.  Few people have ever forged an emotional tie to a bird.  Therefore, the scrub jay does not have the charisma of the tiger and may never garner the support it needs in mainstream conservation.  People interested in preserving that species have invested heavily in essentially a public relations campaign on behalf of the bird to increase his visibility and value to the average person.  I've seen the same thing be true of zoo visitors.  When I was a zookeeper, my personal mission was to make people connect with animals they may never have thought twice of otherwise.  Our collection of native birds was amazing, but often went unnoticed, unless a keeper took the time to explain what made each animal so damn nifty, or in other words, laid the groundwork for that connected feeling people need to have before they can really start investing in an animal's well being.  Animal well being matters.  Conservation of species matters.  But not everyone cares about all animals equally.  People see a difference between species because there IS a difference.  The trick is to help people realize that while a cow isn't like a cat and a scrub jay isn't a tiger, they're still cool animals, worth connecting with, and the rest of the pro-animal behaviors will follow."

Since this is posted in r/vegetarian, I'm going to assume that you eat dairy products. Well, I can just as easily go off on a rant about how insensitive you are for supporting the dairy industry. Cows are artificially inseminated to force them to produce milk. Creating a life is a by product of you wanting to drink milk and eat cheese. And if that baby cow is a male, it will most likely be killed within a couple of years for veal. The young female calves will be taken and inseminated a soon as possible. This concept of breeding cows just to get their milk makes me feel like I'm involved in some sex slave trade.   But plenty of ppl have no problem with it, including lots of vegetarians. So,  just deal with it. It's not your place to judge other ppl. And every one of us does something that another person thinks is morally repugnant."

Killing humans is universally against the law in every country I know of. Killing and eating animals is not illegal in any country that I know of. Not doing so may be widely accepted in some countries, but I don't think any have actually outlawed it. Laws aren't perfect, but they are a good foundation for understanding what ppl generally believe to be moral.   I have no problem with some ppl having their own moral codes that is higher than the laws of their country.

vegetarian,39eayt,Paertan,3,Thu Jun 11 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"Causing a species extinction is analogous to most people as destroying a work of art or burning a book.  It is something unique that adds to the depth and color of the world.  Destroying it makes the world a little grayer and duller and denies everyone after that the opportunity to have that extra piece of uniqueness.  A beautiful painting is just chemicals smeared on a piece of paper.  It is not inherently magical.  But it is still not OK to destroy that and deny others the chance to experience a world with that painting in it.  You don't have to be vegetarian or vegan to abhor species extinction just like you don't have to be an art enthusiast to abhor the destruction of art.  I love bonfires and don't care for paintings, and I'm sure paintings would make great kindling, but I wouldn't actually burn a bunch of original paintings that ""we"" (as a global society) can never again get back.

Most people can understand the emotional bond established with these animals. If they don't own a pet like a dog/cat, then their friends and co workers and random strangers do and they can see that.   I'm sure there are people who can also form emotional bonds with cows, chickens and ducks, but it's such a small minority that most people don't even think twice at that possibility.

So tell me, pious vegetarian, where is your line drawn? What is your criteria for defining unacceptable forms of life for death at human hands?   Let's take a chicken, for example. A chicken has a mother and father, a face, and can certainly communicate through body language / fleeing / acting defensively, that it would prefer I did not kill it.  So can a snake, ant, beetle, spider, bee, mouse, rat, etc etc etc. Would you let these things roam free in your home to respect their freedom of life?  Everything on this Earth survives because of the death of something else, both directly and indirectly. There are even plants that eat live animals.

vegetarian,39ce8u,euripidez,3,Thu Jun 11 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Let's think about ""beef"" first - there's about 400-500 pounds of edible flesh on a single cow. 6 oz of meat would ""meat"" your protein needs if that's your only source of protein. 3 oz per day is considered okay for health, though with some concern about saturated fat, etc. So, all of this in context, a single cow should feed a single person all the protein they need for about 6.5 years.   Perhaps I'm the one making the mistake, but these numbers don't seem to add up.  6 oz of beef offers approximately 40 to 50 grams of protein (on the high end).  That's not enough protein for a sedentary lifestyle, and it's certainly not enough for an active lifestyle.  It's only a portion of what is needed daily for people who lift weights.  500 lbs is 8,000 oz.  That's 1333.33 six oz servings.  As per the example given, that's a little over 3.5 years of someone eating 6 oz of beef a day.  That's no where near the 6.5 years listed.    I came to this subreddit, because I'm seriously considering going vegetarian.  I don't think there is any ethical grounds upon which I can justify causing animals so much unnecessary suffering, and I'm hoping to learn more and get some direction so I can make a serious run at going vegetarian in the future.  I agree with your overall position, but I feel that these numbers are a bit dishonest (intentionally or otherwise), and they really cheapen the message.  I don't mean to nitpick, but I just wanted to be honest and perhaps start a discussion."
vegetarian,39ce8u,ColdShoulder,4,Thu Jun 11 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"According to this source (http://authoritynutrition.com/how-much-protein-per-day/ - sorry, on mobile) sedentary people need about 40-60 per day. There are others who suggest we put too much emphasis on protein. 6 oz per day can give you that, but you're also getting a lot of fat with it. 6 oz if you ONLY eat animal protein. No other protein. So assuming someone with a normal diet eats other food besides beef, they're likely getting protein elsewhere (eggs, nuts, etc.). So 3 oz is ""healthy"" even though it's still high in saturated fat - that's what I based my following numbers off. 3 oz, not 6, assuming most people do not eat a diet of 100% beef."

An active person/athlete is supposed to get up to .8 grams of protein per lb for the best results (some experts even suggest more).    The information on your link just doesn't look reliable.  For instance, I don't want to appeal to incredulity, but how am I to believe that the average male just needs 10 more grams of protein than the average teenage girl?

vegetarian,39ce8u,WhyThinkThat__,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but an active person is always going to be far better off having a bit too much protein than too little.   Too little protein means you don't get into shape as quickly as you could. Your muscles will not fully repair as quickly as they could, and you will, in general, be a physically weaker person than you could be.   Most active people are going to have a tough time estimating how many pounds exactly of lean body mass they have, so they are going to err on the side of more protein rather than less protein.....

I get to eat all of the foods I really enjoy -- I just need to add a couple of protein shakes throughout the day, and those taste pretty good I just don't really like the idea of having protein shakes.  I'd recommend to take it slowly, try it out for one or two days a week and to track your diet carefully before making a full time transition.

My next goal is to really educate myself on vegetarian meals, so I can learn to prepare some good dishes.

I'm not trying to be a damper, but none of these things are related to vegetarianism (well, happiness is -- but only if eating meat is something that was preventing you from being happy)  Being proactive, following your beliefs and being in harmony with your desires is the best way to achieve those things.  Being a vegetarian is more difficult because it will take will power for you, and will power is a finite quantity in humans.   Use whatever will power you do have to do things that will positively effect the world.  If you want to have an interesting life and 'do a lot of things', try joining some clubs / finding some hobbies that interest you and being more active. Fitness is a good place to start, and will have lots of life long benefits.  Eat healthier. Eat a diet high in fibre, lots of variety, and plenty of vegetables. Limit sugars, especially anything with added sugar. Most processed food is designed specifically to increase consumption and addiction -- reduce and eventually remove these from your diet."
vegetarian,39bngb,senfelone,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"It's interesting when you say ""being a vegetarian takes willpower"" because I was raised an Adventist, never ate meat growing up and really don't think about it now that I'm out of the church.  Have I had meat? Sure, but I've not enjoyed it.   For me the heavy sluggish feeling after eating meat is enough to convince me that it's probably not good for my system.  But I would assume that for most people raised eating meat, it's become a “comfort"" food. It reminds you of simpler times.  I'm not sure where I'm going with this, just speculating."
vegetarian,39bngb,lgcurry,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"Of course, that's not true in all cases -- it's all a matter of your frame of reference. But it is pertinent to people who grew up eating, and enjoying meat, and living in a society that typically eats meat.  In that case, it definitely requires some will power to eat vegetarian.   When you have a craving for a food you used to enjoy, it takes willpower not to give in. Or if you go out with your friends to a restaurant that has no vegetarian options, or when every restaurant has the same, underwhelming, vegetarian options.   In the case of someone switching to a vegetarian diet, it's not as though you have someone to answer to -- only yourself and your convictions.   The sluggish feeling is probably due to you not having the right mix of gut bacteria to properly digest meat. The microbiome isn't entirely well understood, but it's an interesting thing to look into the new research that's currently ongoing. I think it plays a significant role in dietary, physical, and mental health."

At some point she states:  ""-Todays meat is likely to contain hormones.  These hormones are fed to the slaughtered animals in order to make them grow faster. ""  ""Your body will need a long time to digest meat.  During this time it will putrefy in your intestines releasing toxins.""  ""Animals raised in suffering leave their negative emotional imprint in the cells of their bodies.  If you cook and eat their meat, you are also consuming this imprint.""  Wether all this information is genuinely true or not, I do agree with most of the things she says. I do believe that consuming animals raised in suffering will probably have an effect on you, emotional, physical or psychological.  Reading what you guys have also said here, I would love to go vegetarian as soon as possible.  Thanks to everyone!!!"

I would say it definitely can have positive effects on people emotionally, but that's really up to the person to decide how they have it impact them.  Personally, I think of my diet as just one small part in my overall effort to live a peaceful and compassionate life.  As Albert Einstein put it, ""Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.""  (Source:  https://books.google.it/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&pg=PA453&hl=it#v=onepage&q&f=false)  There's something to be said for taking an philosophy against causing harm to others, and living it so completely that you refuse to have violence be a part of your diet.   I care about the suffering of animals and the environment, yes, but I also think about all the kids who die of hunger and don't have anything to eat--- perhaps the only option is to hunt for something and cook it (just using my logic).   Yep.  Thankfully, there's no ""this or that"" dichotomy, here.  Going vegetarian won't make anyone else to starve.  Currently, most of the world's grains that are grown are actually fed to the billions of animals that are grown and slaughtered every year to meat our desires for meat, cheese, milk and eggs.  It's shameful that we feed so much to our livestock, just so that we can slaughter them to satisfy our tastes while world hunger is an ongoing problem.  It's also worth noting, starvation isn't a problem of ""not enough to go around.""  It's really a problem of entitlement -- the poor simply don't have access to the resources they need to feed themselves.  Diverting grains to be used for feeding livestock (pigs, cows, chickens, etc.) creates an artificial competition for resources:  Why grow grain to feed the poor (who can't pay much, if any), when you can instead feed it to livestock that you can slaughter and sell to the rich?  As for hunting, it bypasses some of the unethical issues with factory farming, but it's still causing unnecessary death and harm.  It's also not an available option for the masses in 1st world countries, but vegetarianism (and veganism) can be.   I heard that vegetarianism has a whole list of health benefits ...   It usually healthier compared to a Standard American Diet (/ standard 'Western' diet), but that's not a very high bar to set.  It's hard to talk about ""vegetarian diets"" as a whole when talking about healthy/unhealthy, since things like potato chips, oreos, Coca-Cola, redbull, vodka, etc., are all vegetarian (and even vegan)."

With respect to the healthfulness of vegetarianism, the strongest evidence comes from the Adventist Health Studies which are perhaps the most comprehensive examination of the effects of lifestyle on health. There is very clear and strong evidence that vegetarians and vegans have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and better cardiovascular health. Other important information comes from the China Study and the Okinawa Centenary Study.  With respect to the good of the planet, perhaps the most comprehensive source is the report Livestock's Long Shadow from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. It goes into great detail about the environmental effects of animal agriculture. UN officials have often said that the best way to eliminate this issue is for the world to become vegan.

Of course, they are how we get all our information but reading a study and drawing conclusions without understanding context is never a good idea. They may be more sciency than reports, but that doesn't mean that they contain better information. If you are a lay person who doesn't understand the subject well and doesn't want to put in the time to, then read reports written by people who do want to put in that time. Even well done studies can be found that show many things.   That said, let's understand some context. Yes, the 51% number was controversial. But not because of data flaws or mystery math. The key is that animal agriculture outputs methane which is different than carbon dioxide in important ways. Methane is something like 100x more heat trapping than carbon (I forget the exact number, it doesn't matter), but also is more volatile. It breaks down faster. That means if you look at all the green house gasses released this year and the warming they cause this year, the number will be dominated by methane. However, if you look over the next 500 years CO2 becomes more important.  Which timeline is correct?  I have no way to make that call. And I don't think we can know for sure until time passes and we can measure. However, it doesn't matter. By either accounting, animal agriculture is still far more destructive than almost anything else we could practicably stop doing.   Thanks for the links though!

I'm sorry but the UN report is known to be filled with holes, not detailed at all, simplifies data, etc.   Nothing in those sources backs this kind of comment. A cursory examination of the report will reveal that it is highly detailed and contains quite a bit of data that could hardly be simplified. The only ""hole"" is that a figure of 18% was revised to 14.5% based on a different method of counting. The point of my comment was to show that this revision was not based on better understanding of the environmental impact of animal agriculture but was instead based on political pressure from the animal agriculture industry. Notice that the NY Times opinion piece contains much more evidence of this pressure than the one revision.  /u/howtospeak has no leg to stand on. If s/he would be so kind as to explain her/his motivations for questioning this report based on a standard political comment from a known big ag shill, I would reconsider my currently very negative opinion of her/his willingness to evaluate facts as opposed to political statements."

That's an industry that occupies around 30% of the world's landmass and produces calorically and nutritionally dense food. That is in fact incredibly low compared to it's production.

Vieux et. al. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800912000043  They found that meat is so nutritious per unit of greenhouse gas emissions, that when substituted for with fruit and vegetables, diets actually produced more GHGEs."

It's the hook that draws people into being healthier and if they pursue it further they eventually eat less and less meat."
vegetarian,39bngb,itguyy,5,Thu Jun 11 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"There is pretty much only one factor in losing weight, that's eating a deficit of your daily caloric requirements. A person could lose weight eating nothing but bread, or chocolate, or bacon, or broccoli, not that eating exclusively one thing is ever healthy. And one could gain weight by eating nothing but carrots, or onions, or plain rice cakes. Your weight loss has nothing to do with your macros (your keto diet,) and everything to do with your caloric intake."
vegetarian,39bngb,cirquedesolame,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"You can say that all you want but it strictly isn't true, there are studies that show that a ketogenic diet helps you lose more weight more quickly than a high carb diet (you can find some information digging around here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience here is a good page to look at: http://www.dietdoctor.com/weight-loss-time-to-stop-denying-the-science ). And like I said I've switched to keto+vegetarian because it makes more sense to me at this point. In fact I probably never would have went vegetarian at all if it wasn't for the keto diet and getting to this point. And I think for a lot of Americans vegetarian diets aren't going to fly but a ketogenic diet will make us overall healthier and weigh less which would in turn reduce the amount of animals consumed because people won't be as fat. So if your end goal is to reduce the gluttonous consumption of meat I think keto and paleo diets are an important factor in that and for me at least they were a ""gateway diet"" to vegetarian. Because when a fat person thinks vegetarian they think breads and grains which are super super easy to overeat with. With a high fat/protein diet it's a lot harder to do and you also feel full longer, and it's less of a drastic step for most people. If they can drop 100lbs with the only change to their diet being not eating bread they are much more likely to do it. And I'm speaking from experience here so don't just think I'm making shit up and pushing keto to be a troll or anything, I'm not."

That doesn't provide a scrap of evidence against what I said, which is that losing/gaining weight is all about a caloric deficit or excess, respectively. You are talking about how difficult it is to stick to a diet, not the science behind burning or storing calories."
vegetarian,39bngb,cirquedesolame,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:35:46 2015 UTC,Many of the studies had both groups on caloric deficits and the low carb dieters lost more weight. But yes I think a big part of it for me was the ease in which I could stick to it. And as I also said isn't a general reduction in consumption of food and meat in general a benefit? If we can get people to switch to any type of structured diet it will reduce the overall consumption of meat as they become healthier even if they don't go full vegetarian/vegan.

And like I said you can do vegetarian or vegan keto but they are less popular overall, although in general I have to say that I was eating far less meat on keto than I was normally even though that diet for 90% of people on it is meat all the time. But my point was that a healthy diet isn't unique to vegetarianism and it sounds extremely pretentious when people claim that it's so great for you health when most of those studies compare it to shit diets to begin with, of course it's a better diet than eating shit all day, but it's certainly not the only way and we should be more open to any diet that will reduce the total consumption of meat even if it doesn't fully eliminate it yet.

For this reason, ketosis is sometimes referred to as the body's ""fat burning"" mode."" I was looking for research suggesting high meat intake was healthy?   But my point was that a healthy diet isn't unique to vegetarianism   No doubt, I bet a pescetarian  diet can be very healthy.   open to any diet that will reduce the total consumption of meat even if it doesn't fully eliminate it yet.

I started dropping weight, a lot of weight, and regardless of how much meat I was consuming I was definitely healthier than I was being a fat ass, and that is the point of keto for me. I'll try digging around for studies tomorrow there definitely were studies that showed meat intake wasn't correlated with adverse health effects, also remember that keto isn't a high meat diet that is largely just the hook to get people to start it (which is something that vegetarianism doesn't really have for people that are already fat, it just seems like work/torture to most of us). But yeah so eventually I actually started caring more about what I eat and eventually that landed me here, but this is mostly because I like vegetables a lot more now and I can eat more plants than I can meat so it makes me feel like I'm more full, in addition to the sustainability and not harming animals thing.

I could tell you that I feel better since I went vegetarian then vegan, and that my sleep and mental states are also improved, but what I would want to know - and if I was to convince you to become vegetarian, then this might be something I already would know - I would want to know why?  Why are you making this change?  What was your reason for finally deciding this was the right course of action to take?  What brought you to the team?  Is it health?  Meh.  Skin benefits?  Meh.  Disease prevention?  Eh.  I'm glad to have you, don't get me wrong, but I want to hear you talk with pride about how your decisions are finally falling in line with your beliefs.  How you like to think of yourself as a kind person, and your supper is now going to reflect that, how you wouldn't want to hurt anyone else or cause them suffering, and that your diet won't do that anymore.  How you're not going to wonder when you go to sleep, could I be doing more?  Am I doing enough?  Am I doing anything?  Because now you are!  You're making a change, a real difference, and you're joining a group that's united for common reasons and always willing to offer help and support however it's needed whenever it's needed because you're doing something that's truly great, and we want to see you and help you succeed.

Ethically: I know for a fact that animals don't need to suffer for me to live a healthy life, so expecting them to be killed in my name is impossible to justify. Unlike some of the nicer people here, to varying degrees I think it makes you a lesser person: hideously unthoughtful at best, wilfully murderous at worst.

vegetarian,39bngb,aocreata,2,Wed Jun 10 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you read some of Micheal Pollan's books, 'Omnivores Dilemma' and 'In Defense of Food' are both very good. They don't tout just a vegetarian diet, in fact he explores food and food sourcing from a variety of angles with scientific studies and more exploratory journalism. His big take away is that people need to be more aware of how their food is being grown and where it's coming from. We've developed a very unnatural industrial agriculture in the US and it's causing a lot of problems, simply because people are all too happy to pick up a bag of frozen chicken wings from Walmart, etc without thinking twice about the impacts of that food.  What it came down to for me was that I wanted to know where my food was coming from. I wanted to be healthier and make more conscientious decisions about my food sources and the type of ingredients in my food. I gave up meat because frankly, it's very resource intensive which is bad for the environment, and because it's difficult to find meat that has been raised in an ethical manner. I didn't want to have to explain to people why I would eat a burger from grass fed local beef but not from McDonalds. I felt like it left me in a grey area that was too easy to compromise and would quickly let me end up eating and consuming kind of mindlessly.   Over time I have stuck with it because it's become very clear to me that 1.) Unless you have some sort of very specific medical condition, meat is not in any way necessary to my basic nutritional needs and 2) I was being hypocritical by caring about animals but then mindlessly partaking in their suffering. While I'm not completely opposed to people who raise and slaughter animals or even hunt - this kind of stuff is still very integral to the existence of some cultures -, I decided that if it wasn't something I could personally partake in, then I couldn't expect to have someone do it for me and ignore how awful I felt about it. I also think that the way we raise and kill the majority of livestock in the US is highly unethical and dangerous and puts animals through a lot if unnecessary pain and suffering. We have completely detached consumers from how the process works, and that's very intentional. If most people saw an industrial feed lot, a chicken house, or a slaughter house they would probably never eat meat again.  On a side note - being a vegetarian doesn't necessarily equal being healthy. I would start with focusing on filling your plate with more plant based whole foods. You really can't go wrong with that. This sub has a lot of great suggestions on food. There are also some great cookbooks - one of my favorites is the Forks Over Knives book, I believe they movie is also on Netflix - it's worth a watch.  I have definitely noticed a change for the better in my energy, digestion, and overall health since eating a plant based diet. Plus every time I see some article about the growth hormones they are feeding cows or the disease outbreaks for chickens, etc. I'm always glad that I'm not putting that junk in my body."
vegetarian,39bngb,My_Name_Is_Steven,2,Thu Jun 11 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"I tried vegetarianism because I got diagnosed with high blood pressure in my early 20s after some effed up kidney issues. I definitely saw a major improvement in my blood work at my next check up 6 months later. I also just felt way better and more energetic in my day to day life. It was a rocky road to start with because I'd previously been a normal burger eating college student and I thought veggies were gross. But eventually I realized it wasn't veggies I didn't like, it was bad cooking that I didn't like. I think vegetarianism is what taught me how to cook and eat actually tasty (not just fatty and salty) food. I learned to roast, stir fry, and try things I'd never have tried before. The trick, I think, is to learn to appreciate veggies for what they're supposed to be, and not try to turn them into your old foods. Black bean burgers are good if you like black beans, but you're going to feel cheated if you're hoping for a real burger. Find the real flavor and value of a carrot or an eggplant or be brave and experiment with an Indian recipe (they have a large vegetarian population, so there's tons of good recipes) that you'd never have thought about before. And then, of course, there's the animals and the environment, which are also great :)"
vegetarian,39bngb,ComposerNate,2,Thu Jun 11 06:15:53 2015 UTC,"You can get all of the nutrition you need to live without consuming animal products.  This means that the only justifiable reason to choose to eat meat is personal pleasure.    The meat industry necessitates animal suffering.  This means that by choosing to eat meat, you are choosing to gain personal pleasure at the cost of the suffering of an animal.    Personal pleasure at the cost of the suffering of another sentient being is barbaric.  Eating meat is morally equivalent to beating dogs and cats just for the fun of it."

I stumbled across it by accident and was initially going to shut it off, but then I told myself that I should be comfortable seeing how the meat is procured if I'm going to be comfortable eating it.  I haven't ORDERED meat since watching that video.    I put stress on the word ordered, because I will still eat meat if someone gives it to me by accident, like if I am given the wrong item at a restaurant; or if I unknowingly order something that has meat in it... To me it's more inhumane to just throw it out after knowing the shit the animal went through."

Your typical person, vegetarian or not, wouldn't look at a living creature and say they look delicious unless they were poking fun at the fact that they get turned into meat products. What you're looking at has fur and eyes and moves and breathes. That's pretty hard to ignore. Even the most notorious of meat eaters don't literally see them as walking hamburgers. Saying what you have and being completely serious about it is atypical.

Then I put the screen with the tofu in the sink, and run the hot water onto it (over just one side is fine since the slices are pretty thin), and then after onto a plate with some paper towel to suck out the last of the water.  Gets em really dry quick, and then yeah like you said it makes it a lot easier to fry them and it's easier to get that crispy, fully-cooked consistency when shallow pan-frying :)"

Instead of focusing on the full-blown vegetarian aspect, I would take things one meal at a time, and see if you can (HEALTHILY) transition into a full vegetarian diet.   I can't offer any specific advice, but my sister was diagnosed with Celiac disease (cannot eat gluten-based products), and she's breastfeeding a baby that seems to be allergic to lactose. Thus, she can't have dairy either.  So, her diet started becoming so ridiculously hard, especially with her ravenous appetite from breastfeeding, that she abandoned her vegetarian diet and started eating meat. This was a person who was a vegetarian for over 10 solid years.  I'm not saying your girlfriend can't do it, but for some people it can be really hard, if not nearly impossible, to be healthy and a vegetarian at the same time."

vegetarian,396wnf,vl06,2,Tue Jun 9 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of the ""complete protein"" stuff is blown way out of proportion.  Yes, different protein sources have slightly higher amounts of certain amino acids, but the difference is not all that significant.  There's essentially no such thing as an ""incomplete protein"" in any food that's considered a protein source, with the exception of seitan.  Seitan does not contain any tryptophan.  This one doesn't really matter anyway, because tryptophan is quite abundant in a large number of things that aren't usually considered high in protein.  Things like bread, potatoes, and corn all contain significant amounts of tryptophan.  You can easily have a balanced diet with seitan as your only high protein food while still getting all your essential amino acids.  As long as you're eating something that's considered ""high in protein"", you're going to be getting all your essential amino acids.  There's a nice chart here: http://veganhealth.org/articles/protein  I agree that variety is good.  It's good for other reasons, though."

Insert any leefy green and you have the same problem.   There really isn't any vegetable that's mass production isn't harming the environment any more than there's a meat production not harming the environment. Some are to much lesser degrees than others.

vegetarian,396wnf,PumpkinMomma,7,Tue Jun 9 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"""greek yogurt is definitely at or near the bottom""   How is this possible when there is metabolic overhead, even using pro-dairy sources for energy conversion the rate is about 19% efficiency.  http://www.milkproduction.com/Library/Scientific-articles/Nutrition/Energy/  This means that you need to feed 5 times the amount of food to the cow that you get in return in just to get raw unpasteurized milk. So you not only have the environmental impact of 5 times whatever the cow is eating, you also then add in the impact of the cow. Then on top of this you require the process to actually make the greek yogurt, which introduces even more environmental overhead.  I would love to see some evidence to support your claim that greek yogurt is at or near the bottom of this list."

Bose chose a plant whose mots were cautiously dipped up to its stem in a vessel holding the bromide solution. The salts of hydrobromic acid are considered a poison. He plugged in the instrument with the plant and viewed the lighted spot on a screen showing the movements of the plant, as its pulse beat, and the spot began to and fro movement similar to a pendulum. Within minutes, the spot vibrated in a violent manner and finally came to an abrupt stop. The whole thing was almost like a poisoned rat fighting against death.

vegetarian,3954co,Kolibry,3,Wed Jun 10 05:21:42 2015 UTC,"Being vegetarian is a personal decision, much like your grandmother's perception that it's a phase. As long as she isn't trying to sabotage you, shake it off and rise to the challenge. If you're doing it for yourself, it shouldn't make a difference what anyone else thinks. If you're vegetarian, and do it realizing it's your adventure, it will involve sacrifice, and maybe a few politely skipped meals. It's no big deal, plan ahead and be ready to take care of your own needs (like discretely bringing your own food, in the case if the pub). I've found that by making my diet my problem, and not putting others out, or having unrealistic expectations, it becomes a minor curiosity, rather than something people feel a need to challenge or make a big deal about.

I've had so many problems being accepted as a vegetarian that I no longer object when I go out for dinner with friends and they stick some chicken or whatever on my plate.

Eating meat is a by-product of living in areas where animals were better prepared to survive in the climate then the nomadic people who lived there. Freezing plains in Mongolia, often poisonous jungles in South America, arid deserts in the Middle East, and the barren mountains in Europe and Asia all maintained large, ancient groups of humans where the environment would have killed them, whereas the native wildlife was accustomed to the vegetation or the environment itself. Without going into too much evolutionary biology, Humans are able to eat and process meat, and at that time it was needed. In our current globalized market we have access to all food, all year. People don't need to eat meat. It is a choice for the percentage of humanity that can afford to do so. The modern system of centralized livestock rearing is the cheapest method of raising that product available, and even though it appears to be cold and distant to people who have little experience in the process, the techniques used in raising animals in a modern system have been developed taking into account all of the necessities that the particular animal needs. It is not traditional, it is not romantic, it is not natural, but as a self aware organism, humanity refuses to stay traditional, romantic or natural; we always grow and move forward."

In 1999, researchers found cut marks on animal bones dated at around 2.5 million years old. But no one could be sure that they were made by meat-eating hominids, because none appeared to have suitable teeth.  Now an analysis by Peter Ungar of the University of Arkansas has revealed that the first members of Homo had much sharper teeth than their most likely immediate ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, the species that produced the famous fossil Lucy.  Eating meat requires teeth adapted more to cutting than to grinding. The ability to cut is determined by the slope of the cusps, or crests. ""Steeper crests mean the ability to consume tougher foods,"" Ungar says. He has found that the crests of teeth from early Homo skeletons are steeper than those of gorillas, which consume foods as tough as leaves and stems, but not meat.   http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4122-meat-eating-is-an-old-human-habit.html#.VXXA0IvF98E"

Read this(it's long, I know) if you want to see where meat eaters go wrong.  Basically, meat eaters in our society are concerned with eating the muscle meat of the animal, rather than the entire beast. Not to mention, carnism is deeply ingrained in world cultures. I applaud vegans for making hard strides to think outside the box, and forego carnism in favor of nutrition in an intelligent, humane way. While I am not entirely vegan myself, I like to think that the next evolution of our species is being able to elicit nutrition and longevity of human life from our environment independent from any any repressed violence system, especially carnism."

Her summary...   That doesn’t mean the solution is to go vegan. Nor is it necessarily to eat a low-animal-protein diet. But perhaps it’s time to seriously explore options like protein cycling, periodic fasting, or just cooking up heaps o’ bone broth to get that glycine down our gullets.   I generally eat one meal per day and I've intentionally gone 6 days without any food.  I also quite enjoy bone broth and chewy pig skin and ears.   Not to mention, carnism is deeply ingrained in world cultures   Carnism has nothing to do with the question of are humans natural omnivores or not.

There are vegans who lots of fake meats/refined grains, eat lots of processed food, emotionally eat, and are obsessed about their weight and/or are on a perpetual diet and there are omnivores that do the same thing.    Similarly,  there are people that don't count a single calorie, rarely exercise (granted they should), but have a healthy weight because they don't eat too much (even though they eat till they're full) and avoid processed junk that is bad for them (and causes them to overeat).

If plants are fertilized with feces (even yours), then yes, you can get adequate B12 if you don't wash it off."

I'm an aerospace engineer doing stress analysis for aircraft parts and R&D contracts (SBIRs and STTRs) put out by NASA and the Air Force mainly to advance aircraft preliminary design.  I have 5 chronic diseases.  Crohn's disease is the worst one I have and runs very strongly in my family.  I don't even have it the worst.  My cousin got a colostomy bag at age 16.  My dad has had 2 severe gut ruptures (and subsequent surgeries) and a severe stroke due to his medications coupled with one of those gut ruptures (sepsis).  At age 29, my disease were out of control and had been for 2.5 years.  I was 5'10"" and 115 pounds.  My gut was horribly upset all the time (hence the weight), my back felt like it was on fire most of the time.  I took 2-3 Imodium per day to try and control my gut (it didn't work) and my doctors were clueless.  I had been telling them for 2 years what to do with me because they would say ""I don't know what's wrong with you"".  These weren't bad doctors either.  They were some of the best in the country, who stayed up on the latest medical research.  I just lived with it.  I couldn't manage my emotions (I had serious depression and rage issues), my vision was getting dramatically worse (lack of nutrients because none of them were absorbed), I was tired and cold all the time (I was too skinny), had severe memory problems (I'd lose my keys, find them and have forgetten why I was searching for them), had daily night sweats (a sign of massive inflammation), and was B12 and iron anemic (again the gut issues), and had severe insomnia.  I knew the cause of most of them, but I couldn't deal with the root problem.  I started learning about health.  I completely cut refined sugar.  Then I got this crazy idea that if I cut back on starches, I wouldn't carb crash so hard after lunch.  It helped that a little (it was really an issue of the insomnia + being too skinny), but almost instantly I quit my Imodium.  Turns out I have severe issues with bread.  I also have issues with many other FODMAPs (e.g. cauliflower and mushrooms) that wreak my bowels (bloating), cause muscle spasms, which cause me to bleed weight.  I put on 30 pounds in a year after changing my diet and all my issues went away.  I was curious about Celiac, went to get tested, and ate bread for a week.  All my issues came back.  The lab messed up, so I don't know if I have it, but it doesn't matter to me anymore.  I can't eat bread and I don't really care why.  The most interesting part was my dramatic mood changes that happen from eating bread.  I'm the most happy person off bread and I'm an ass if I eat any.  I've done a lot of research since then and am very interested in how to get my gut bacteria as diverse and as happy (e.g. eat resistant starch) as possible to avoid GI problems as well as the place fasting has in controlling chronic disease (even if you don't lose weight).  I truly believe that gut bacteria research and it's place in human health is going to pay off 1000x more than human genetics research.  I think it's also far more complicated."

Maybe you could take a look at /r/vegetarianketo but in fact you don't need to avoid carbs, most dietitians recommend at least 75% of your calories to come from carbs, they're not evil. With how you describe your prospective diet, you'd be getting more than enough protein. You'll pick up even more protein from the vegetables you eat, it's really in just about everything. For inspiration for meals, head over to /r/VegRecipes."

Since I'm not no carb I can just throw in a sweet potato or some beans here and there.

Oh one more thing, make sure you're getting extra iron, because eggs for example (and to a greater extent coffee, tea and dairy) may hinder absorption."
vegetarian,38zhf4,breakplans,3,Mon Jun 8 08:21:37 2015 UTC,"I wanted to suggest potatoes, but see you already like them! But I'd also like to add that you should be a bit more wary about quinoa, and embrace the rice life! A quick google search can show you the ethical issues of quinoa (how it can only be grown in very specific places, and its popularity has made it difficult for the locals/farmers themselves to get food).  Don't worry about protein, as many will tell you on this sub, if you eat enough calories (~2000 for women, ~2500 for men) per day, you'll be getting plenty of protein! Adding in beans and peas, as well as the occasional bit of tofu or eggs, and you'll surpass your daily quota very easily."
vegetarian,38zhf4,vl06,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"Quinoa provides a complete protein all by itself, so that's a fine alternative if you like it better than rice.   However, rice is by no means a useless carb. That's a myth. And there are many different types of rice with different flavors to explore. They have different nutritional values and some of them even have pretty decent protein content.   If you have a whole foods, they usually have an aisle with loose rice where you can bag the amount you want. You could try many different kinds if inclined.

vegetarian,38zhf4,JeanWire,3,Mon Jun 8 08:18:07 2015 UTC,"I would recommend adding some carbs to your diet. Quinoa is sort of overrated. I just googled ""quinoa nutrition label"" and ""whole wheat pasta nutrition label."" Both had about 14-15% of their calories from protein. Also, if you're eating a lot of fruits and veggies as your main food source, you'll have few, if any, issues with getting adequate nutrients but you might be low on calories. Carbs help ensure you have enough energy.  Also a good idea would be to sketch out a rough daily meal plan and check your protein. The USDA recommends about 50 grams of protein a day, and you need more if you work out. If I get too little protein I feel very sluggish. Eggs are good, beans are good, and my latest obsession is mushrooms- they are very low calorie and get almost half of their calories from protein.  Finally, check if your whey protein is vegetarian! Whey is a by-product of cheese production. Some cheese is made by curdling milk with the stomach acid of freshly slaughtered calves. Most cheese in the US is made using vegetarian enzymes, but it doesn't hurt to double check. Vegetarian whey is available, as well as soy protein."

Potatoes are definitely on the table and will probably be a significant source of my carbs along with quinoa, fruit, and whatever I get from veggies. I'm not ""low carb"" per say but I used to like to keep less than 40% of my daily calories from carbs, and it has helped me maintain my weight pretty well (anecdotally I guess, but I always feel bloated after too many carbs, even when meat isn't involved).

Plus, many vet students come from a farming background and go into a career in the livestock industry (someone's gotta approve all those antibiotics, am I right?), so those ones are probably not very apt to think critically about animal farming.  All I'm saying is, don't expect too much."
vegetarian,38y458,IceRollMenu2,5,Sun Jun 7 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience there do seem to be a disproportionate number of vegetarian vets. But because we live in a society that teaches that pigs, cows and chickens are really things to use it's not surprising that that is where the majority of vets fall. Also, vets divide into two main specialties (at least in the US) large animals and small animals.   The small animal vets see dogs and cats so maintain their cognitive dissonance in the same way that people selling hot dogs for dog & cat shelters do. The large animal vets see farm animals and it's their job to oversee them and maintain the herd and get them fat enough to be slaughtered ASAP. As IceRoll points out, they are the ones who show up, sign off on medicating the whole herd with antibiotics (which encourage weight gain as well as prevent infection in shit conditions) and such. Expecting them to be any sort of ally to animals is ridiculous."

vegetarian,38sjl1,Aryada,5,Sat Jun 6 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who grew up on a beef and dairy farm, what struck me is how unsustainable those dairy cow lifespans are. 4 years is just enough time for a cow to replace herself (statistically speaking). Factor in even a very small failure rate (early death, illness, stillbirth, etc.) And you've got a herd count of zero after enough generations. I'm not saying the graphic is wrong, I double checked the current stats and those appear correct. I'm just saying I'm surprised."
vegetarian,38sjl1,MyKittyIsAMurderer,5,Sat Jun 6 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well, she just has to have one living daughter in that time to replace her. And a cow can get pregnant as early as a year old (I think 9 months old, actually, but I know it varies). Half the babies will be boys, so of course they don't count. But that still leaves time for a daughter or two.    But then those daughters can have daughters of their own in that time. So that's yet more cows. When you factor in granddaughters then I don't think it looks like that hard to maintain herd size."
vegetarian,38sjl1,M4124124,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"Cows can get pregnant at 9 months I'm sure (some do have heats at that time) but I've never heard of a dairy farmer breeding a calf younger than one year old. They're simply too small yet. Both mom and baby would be at very high fatality risk and both would definitely suffer stunted growth (a profitiability killer in that business) and mom would additionally risk permanent reproductive damage (another big profitability risk).  Average first calving is at 2 years old, with 1 calf per year following.  So, at two years old, mom produces a bull calf. He goes to some sort of meat operation. Maybe veal maybe steer. But for a dairy, he gets written off. A year goes by. Mom turns 3 and produces a daughter. So mom has now provided a replacement. A year goes by. Mom turns 4 and is culled (beefed).  I have to assume that she does not have a 3rd calf because a cow who has just calved is producing at her maximum, and therefore worth keeping until 5 years old. So mom has only produced on daughter. If her daughter is also average, she will only have a single daughter as well, just replacing herself, and her daughter just replaces herself and so on. This works just fine until the stat rolls around where somebody dies in labor or miscarries or gets hit by the milk truck or whatever and doesn't replace themself.  Tldr; a herd of 400 will be a herd of 399 next year, 398 the year after that, and so on."
vegetarian,38sjl1,MyKittyIsAMurderer,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Except that that daughter might have another daughter before the grandma is killed. So, by the time the first cow is killed, you may have two cows to replace her, or maybe just one, but on average more than one. And so on with every generation. That's how it ends up working out.   That's also why humans who have children sooner than later increase the world population more than if they waited longer, even if they decide to have the same number of children."

For religious, social, or other reasons.   If you're a health vegetarian, a small amount of meat in the oil won't cause you much problems unless you have a serious Allergy.

I will avoid eating anything from a grill that has had meat on but hasn't been washed before cooking the veggie option. I guess I don't want bits of charred meat all over my food.

vegetarian,38fgjo,brenna55,5,Wed Jun 3 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I think your best move would probably be to consult a registered dietician who can make sure you're staying on track with your IRL health and help you come up options for foods that meet your nutritional needs and make you happy.   As far as keeping you full and not losing weight, the most important thing is to get enough fat in your diet. Fat has more than twice as many calories per gram as protein or carbs. It's present in varying degrees in all animals ( and most animal byproducts) but is generally less prevalent in plants and plant byproducts. This means you may have to make a conscious effort to consume enough fat on a plant-based diet.   Luckily high-fat plant foods are some of the yummiest stuff on the planet: coconut milk, olives, tree nuts, avocados, seeds (like sesame  and sunflower)."

vegetarian,38fgjo,lgcurry,2,Wed Jun 3 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"I would recommend starting to track your diet now using myfitnesspal. That way, once you change your diet you can try to maintain your calories/macros to a certain extent (or increase them, since you're underweight -- but again, under the supervision of a doctor).   I'd recommend starting slowly by lowering your meat intake and replacing that with suitable vegetarian proteins/fats. Maybe try to have a few dedicated vegetarian days each week and see how you feel on those days?   Stress is more unhealthy than removing meat from your diet, so you want to make sure you are comfortable with your decision and feel well (mentally as well as physically). If you focus on eating healthy as a vegetarian, I would guess that you'll probably be better off than you are currently eating meat."

I always figured that there was such a large industry, my simple decision to not eat meat wouldn't have an effect on how much the industry decided to process. Vegetarian trends have been growing for awhile that it would be neat to see if there is anything with actual losses due to vegetarians."
vegetarian,38cxr7,Roller_ball,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:01:18 2015 UTC,"Basic economics: if there is demand for something, then the industry reacts for this (as they can sell more of that stuff for profit), so they increase the supply. So of course it does not work strictly in a way like ""if I become a vegetarian, then I safe 500 chickens during my lifetime"". Rather the more people eat vegetables, fruits, or maybe artificially cloned lab-meat, the less animals will die, as low demand on the long term decreases supplies too.  ☺  By the way this is the lab-meat I am talking about; although it is not widely available yet, but on the long term it can be expected to be cheaper and more efficient to manufacture this, then raising and killing whole living animals (which have literally tons of byproducts, and high additional costs): http://www.fastcoexist.com/3044572/the-325000-lab-grown-hamburger-now-costs-less-than-12  *edit: clarification"

I just wonder if anyone actually done the actual research (besides Fermi approximations) about what the actual amount of animals aren't turned to meat due to vegetarian diets."
vegetarian,38cxr7,bewareofduck,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, the forces of supply and demand do not suggest that supply is a determinant of aggregate demand. Rather, consumer tastes shifts the aggregate demand curve inwards, resulting in a lower than before quantity supplied, and at a lower price. So yes, people do make a difference. 3 meals a day x 7 days a week x 52 weeks a year and so on."
vegetarian,38cxr7,bewareofduck,0,Thu Jun 4 06:25:23 2015 UTC,"Applying supply and demand to abstaining from animal products is almost always oversimplified. If demand falls and there is now too much supply (enough people stop eating meat, dairy, eggs), the price of those things will drop. That causes others who eat animal products to purchase more animal products than they did before and the amounts purchased will keep increasing until it reached equilibrium, where supply and demand are equal again. This might mean slightly fewer animals are killed than before, but it's definitely not 'I didn't buy this one dead chicken at the store, so exactly one fewer chickens will be killed in the future.'"

Plenty of people who are omnis will assume something is disgusting because it's veg*n until they actually try it. By sweetening it or adding flavor, you surprise them. By leaving it plain (such as tofu) they think it's disgusting because they already have made their mind up before even trying it.  Just like children and green vegetables."

Of course it adds a taste of coconut to everything but since I love coconut that is fine by me. Chocolate and other tastes will cover the coconut if you don't like it.  It will freeze a bit harder though. So don't be afraid to add some alcohol in there. Just a small bit. It will make it softer and can also make it taste even better. Saw Bourbon in one of these recipes. Never tried that. But I did do a Chocolate Mint once using Mintu.  Anyway these looks great. Gonna have to try some. Just made 1,5 liter ice cream yesterday though so it will have to wait xD"
vegetarian,387syz,Paertan,-2,Wed Jun 3 05:59:01 2015 UTC,"I dislike that they are using the term 'ice cream' for this.

I think oftentimes, dairy mutes delicate flavors, and non-dairy frozen desserts often can offer better flavor.  Just don't try to pretend it's something it isn't."
vegetarian,387syz,demosthenes83,0,Wed Jun 3 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that if you sell something like this it should not be called Ice cream. In the same way nothing called Juice is allowed to have anything else than juice in them. Here in Sweden I think it is allowed to call it Ice cream no matter what you use making it. Using oatmilk for example. But here it is called ""Glass"". ""Ice Cream"" has the word ""Cream"" in it. So it should also be cream in the product.  Anyway when you do recipes like this it is fine since it is for people searching for a way to make ice cream and remain vegan. I don't think there is a word for milk free ice cream. Parfait is ice cream but you don't stir it (aka don't own a ice cream machine) and frozen yogurt is well frozen yogurt. Sorbet is using juice and stuff. Never heard a name for ice cream without cream. Except Ice."

vegetarian,387syz,unimpresseddragon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:55:34 2015 UTC,"Well yes in Sweden at least almond milk it is not allowed to be called milk. It is called ""Almond drink"". Milk is protected. You can't add or modify it and call it milk. Lactose free milk is not even allowed to be called milk here. Just as juice. Juice is always 100% fruit juice. Even if it doesn't say so on the box.   And yes I do like that. I like to know what I eat. For example since this is the /r/vegetarian There are many different forms of vegetarianism.

vegetarian,3880cd,generalfalderal,3,Tue Jun 2 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Horray! Channa Masala is super cheap and decently easy to make in my experience. Also, Samosas are amazing. They're fried, so it might be a little challenging. You can get frozen ones at the store though.   Also: samosa filling can be made into a kind of curry. We used to do this at a restaurant I used to work at:   make samosa filling: cooked and chopped potatoes, peas and carrots heat up tomato sauce with heavy cream. You want to add cream until the sauce turns a light orange add samosa filling and spice as desired (cumin, coriander, tumeric, etc. you can just season heavily with curry powder if you don't want to buy all that stuff and bother with making your own blend. Otherwise you can find ground versions of those spices at the bulk sections of most grocery stores and whole seeds at Indian grocery stores) toss in chopped cilantro (I go ahead and use a whole plant's worth. just in case you're not aware, you don't have to pick all the leaves off individually thankfully, you can just cut it where the leafy bits end and toss the stems away/save the stems for other stuff) stir to combine add to cooked rice. You can just eat it like this or, like we did in the restaurant, you can combine it and put it into a tortilla and make a wrap.     Let me know if that sounds good/ is too vague. Also! If you decide to get super into Indian food, I suggest buying a spice grinder so you can toast and grind your own spices. My parents got me one for Christmas and it changed my life."

It can be cooked in a camp oven, a foil pouch, banana leaves. You can put the whole lump of dough straight in the coals and break away the charcoal before you eat. You can put little chunks on sticks and cook it marshmallow-style.  It's a very basic crusty bread. It goes amazing with soup or baked beans. Add honey for a sweet treat."

vegetarian,387tem,breakplans,2,Wed Jun 3 13:05:26 2015 UTC,"A favorite here is filled mushrooms with boursin cheese. You can fill them with different varieties or knockoffs, but at my home, we find the original kind the best one.  Make sure the cheese bubbles a little bit, it mixes heavenly with the mushroom juices. Sop it all up with a bit of bread. Heavenly.  Also good on the grill is some eggplant and soft goat's cheese. Bake one side of the egplant, turn and put some cheese on it while the other side browns.  Same thing with zuchinni and feta cheese.  Halloumi! (deserves to be mentioned again ;))  Also baked camembert with toast to dip in it. I haven't tried this one myself, it's still on my to do list, but I imagine it tastes even better then the oven baked ones that I had in french restaurants and I adore :) Rustic, but delicious and perfect for camping out! You can also dip some veggies in it, but seriously, toast is where it's at with this one.  Okay, that's a lot of cheese, I know. On the other hand, that shit is gooood.  I personally also like a good but somewhat dry store bought burger/sausage (right now I'm in a quorn filet period) with lots and lots of grilled veggies and some type of sauce on a bun. A bit lame and classic, but hey. The grilled veggies really make the burger less dry.  Also handy for when you have little time and want something different are those precooked and preseasoned patato wedges/pieces on a bit of tinfoil with some oil on it. But don't close the tinfoil or they'll get soggy. You can also put them on skewers and roast them on an open fire, but only it it's not too hot, because the outside will burn and the inside will be raw, you need to take some time for it. But they do taste heavenly when done correctly.  As desert, apart from bananas, you can also do apples. Take out the center and fill it up with dark brown suger, cinnamon and some almond powder. If you don't have that last one, it's ok, but that's the way we used to do it as kids. All in some foil and then having a lot of patience. Great with some vanilla icecream, but also good without.  Instead of (non-vegetarian :() marshmellows, I like to put some medium qualitynougat on a stick. It also caramelises and it's a cozy thing to do.  Wow, this is a lot. I like grilling myself, in case you can't tell ;) If I remember more I'll add later."

For example, I do something like this:  2 scoops protein powder 1 bananas 2 tbsp peanut butter 2 tbsp cocoa powder 1.5 cups milk   660 calories, 14g fat, 30g carb, 28g protein  You can easily sweeten to taste by adding honey/dates to increase the calories as well. I.e. add 1 more banana and a tbsp of honey to increase it to 820 calories.  You can also try this site for some meal recommendations / ideas.

After all, those cold cut meats and cheese slices are pre-prepped too. So for vegetarian meals you might have to do the pre-prepping yourself.   A lot of the super quick meals I make are Mexican: quesadillas, black bean tacos, nachos with salsa / cheese / black beans / whatever, etc.  For black bean tacos I open up a can of black beans, put it in the pan with a couple spoonfuls of salsa (however much you like), and spice it with cumin and chili pepper. I heat it on the stove for about 5-10 mins. I suppose you don't have to heat it up but I find it tastes better that way. Then I just put it in a tortilla (and put on any toppings I want) and call it a day."

It was cold spinash mashed potatoes. With some cheese and mayo. And it was glorious.  But anyways. 'Not so weird' (and non-vegan) thing I like on my sandwiches are tomato,mozarella and pesto or basilicum, oil, pepper and salt. So basically a sandwich caprese. Also good with young goat cheese instead of mozarella. During summer I always have some tomatoes lying around and have a pot basilicum on my balcony, so I only need to buy the mozarella, and that keeps long also, so I have that often. Plus it's a very versatile chees. If you don't want to keep basilicum, a tube of it keeps like forever in your fridge.  Apart from that, my current 'fast food' weird thing is that I also have those little cans of chickpeas. Drain them, some sambal/srirachi/spicy pizza oil on them and that's a low calorie snack that fills me up, but that I'm not incredibly proud of.  Other than that, most my favorite sandwishes require some specific ingredients or some prep, like omeletlettucetomatoebbqsauce or grana padano with roqquette (and if there's time some other grilled vegetables), pepper and olive oil.  Also fast is toaster oven wrap pizza's. Take a wrap, put some tomato paste plus some complementary sauce/thing you have lying around (I've tried it with bbq sauce, ketchup, some herbs... even sour cream worked), some cheese/vegetables/olives/whatever you have lying around and set it a minute or 2 under the grill.

Don't overly stress yourself if you feel overwhelmed and take it slow if you have to. Avoid a lot of the processed meat replacers except as treats. There are great ones out there but they are expensive and really add up quickly on grocery bills, hence the misconception that it is more expensive to be veg. Buy a lot of bulk, dry beans and lentils. They come in handy and are really cheap and versatile proteins. Supplement - look for a b12 supplement. Ideally one without gelatin. You'll need it. If you're unfamiliar with spices, or an inexperienced cook, I suggest looking into recipes to give you ideas. A lot of people struggle because they get hungry or bored with the food...

That being said, there is nothing wrong with tofurky, Gardein, or whatever. I enjoy it from time to time as well.

vegetarian,385uqi,M4124124,3,Tue Jun 2 18:34:23 2015 UTC,I've not heard of any concerns about b12 deficiency in vegetarian groups who are still consuming egg and dairy products. Could be wrong though.
vegetarian,385uqi,Homomojojojo,2,Tue Jun 2 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"It happens. It just takes longer. Here's one study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23356638  If you start with high stores of B12 it can take years for deficiency to develop. If you're still eating animal products, you will still get some B12. And that will slow deficiency further. Add some fortified products (many plant milks, some nutritional yeast, a lot of energy drinks) and that slows it further. But that doesn't mean that your rates are not declining and that you'll avoid deficiency long term. But, frankly, a lot of people don't stay vegetarian forever and many vegetarians haven't been vegetarian for long, so that's another issue with studies of vegetarians.    That's not to say that B12 isn't an issue. B12 deficiency is an issue for meat eaters, as well. I've known two people who got dementia from low B12 due to age related absorption issues. B12 supplements are recommended to people over 50, those with digestive issues, and heavy drinkers because of reduced absorption among these groups. So, taking a B12 supplement is a very wise idea for most people."

vegetarian,385uqi,euripidez,8,Tue Jun 2 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"You need to know how to cook brown rice:  Use 1 ¾ cups of water for one cup of long grain rice or 3 cups of water for 2 cups of rice.  Simmer for 65 minutes, and let it rest in the covered pot for 15 minutes.  Then fluff the rice with a long tinned fork.  When it’s been in the fridge overnight it’s good for fried rice.  EDIT:  Black beans  Refried Black Beans This yields about 2 ½ cups of refried beans.  1 cup dried black beans  2 and 3/4  cups of water  A tablespoon and a half of ground cumin  1 tablespoon and a half of chili powder  1 teaspoon oregano  Crushed red pepper to taste (I think I use around 1 tablespoon.)  A liberal dose of garlic powder, or maybe 4 or 5 diced cloves  Salt and soy sauce to taste  First sort through the beans for small pebbles.  It’s gotten pretty unusual to find any in the last few years, but it still happens and a minute spent looking for stones beats the alternative method of finding them, which usually involves breaking a tooth.  Rinse the beans under cold water and salt lightly, like you are salting a piece of chicken.  But go easy on the salt.  Next, add the cumin, chili powder, and crushed red pepper and pour in the water.  It will take about five minutes to come to a boil in a covered pot.  Reduce to a slow simmer, and set a timer for 1 hour and 5 minutes.  When the timer goes off, check to make sure that you have enough water left, then restart the timer.  After the second time the timer goes off the beans should be far enough along for a taste test.  They will be spicier, but less salty than the finished product.  If I’m sure that they need more salt I add soy sauce.  Now is also the time to add the garlic and oregano.  The beans should be just barely covered with water.  If they’re not, add more water.  Reset the timer for 20 minutes and continue.  Turn the heat off after the timer goes off the third time, taste the beans, and let them sit in the covered pot for maybe another 20 minutes.  I mash them in an oiled cast iron pan over a flame.  A large spoon may not be the best tool for the job, but that’s what I use.   Adjust the heat as you go so that you cook the mixture down as you work it into a paste.  When almost all the beans are mashed, and the spoon leaves dry spots in the pan that don’t fill back in on their own, you’re done.  It takes me about ten minutes.  Total time is about 3 hours, with about 20 minutes of hands-on time.  I use these as a taco filling and as a base for a stir fry sauce.  For the sauce I mix the bean paste with just a little less water by volume.  For a single serving I use about ½ cup of beans and mix with a little less cold water by volume, and about a level teaspoon of cornstarch, and a fair amount of soy sauce.  My go to stir fry vegetables are onion, green pepper and green beans seasoned with garlic.  Serve this over a bed of rice, and the beans and rice make a nice, complete protein.  I haven’t used it as a dip, but I think it would make a good one.  For a dip I would add maybe some diced onion and a little acid from lime or lemon juice, or vinegar."

vegetarian,383n5l,AbomodA,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:09:08 2015 UTC,"As if that water magically disappears... It's only an issue if they are drinking potable water for human consumption or there is a severe drought in which they are using shared water. In fact in CA privately owned water cannot be sold to other people so if a rancher has a private pond/lake/stream that their cattle drink from they are making use of a resource that would otherwise be unused. Then they piss it back out and it gets absorbed back into the ground evaporates, and comes back as rain. Water is renewable, much more so when it isn't being filled with chemicals (shower, washing machine) so it's really not that big of a deal. How much water do you consume? Maybe humanity should just collectively kill themselves to be more humane on other species? There is a point where arguments against meat consumption just become ridiculous and make us look like loons this is pretty borderline and to anyone intelligent laughable."

vegetarian,385ins,FurriesRuinEverythin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"Yes! I had to do this to figure out what was causing my digestive issues.  Elimination YES:  Bananas, berries, all green leafy veggies, all nuts as long as you haven't had a nut allergy in the past- these are usually extreme allergies, not the mild digestion stuff (true nuts, not legumes like peanuts), seeds, brown rice, oils, vinegars  I would eat shakes made out of fruit and green veggies, rice and veggie bowls, snacks of seeds and nuts for about a week. Then you slow add stuff in.  Things to especially watch out for and slow add carefully, look for signs of discomfort:  Citrus fruits, apples, oats, whole grain bread, nightshades (tomatoes/eggplants), corn, soy/tofu, TVP, eggs and dairy if you eat them, legumes, carrots, celery.  I hope that was helpful! Elimination diets helped me figure out that peanuts and apples cause gas issues, alongside too many whole grain carbs. Good luck!"

I'd recommend just watch what you eat. Read up on eating full proteins. Basically meat provides the essentials for human survival in one little package. While to get a whole protein in vegetables you need to eat a variety. Do some research on it. It is super helpful.

Skin, nail, and hair quality can also decline with too few fats as someone else here already mentioned (again, eggs, dairy, plant oils, nuts, and avocadoes are all potential fat-sources), and Vitamin E is super important for these things as well (leafy greens and nuts).  The doc can definitely point you in the right direction as to what you're missing, and a quick google search will usually turn up a bunch of foods that are rich in what you need.

(For example, plain Lay's and Ruffles, Fritos, and various and sundry tortilla chips.  The store brands, too.  Cheetos are vegetarian, but obviously not vegan.)  One I can think of that is surprisingly NOT vegetarian is Cool Ranch Doritos - they contain gelatin.  There's also always bags of nuts to snack on.  A good snack for a mixed vegetarian/vegan/omnivore crowd is a giant bag of tortilla chips with a bowl of salsa and another bowl of homemade bean dip.  To make the bean dip, get a can of vegetarian or fat-free refried beans or refried black beans, and mix in about half a jar of salsa, picante sauce, or taco sauce.  Garnish the top with sliced jalapenos or green onions if you want to get fancy.  Actually, the chips you ran into with beef flavoring are the exception.  Most chips, even the flavored kind,  are at least lacto-vegetarian.  Just read the ingredients label before you buy them, and you shouldn't have to give up too many of your snacks."

Unless you're talking about vacuum packed meat sticks of course.  I used to work for a snack distributor. The most common things to look out for is gelatin and rennet. Gelatin is found in TONS of jelly things like jelly beans, some gunmy bears, gummy worms, etc. (but not all) If there is something that has that gummy texture, look at the ingredients for gelatin.  Rennet is often found in dry snacks that have a cheese dusting, like white cheddar popcorn. Again, look at the ingredients for rennet. If it just says ""enzymes"" I'd say it's safe, but you can always email a company and ask if it microbial or animal rennet."

vegetarian,37ztr8,yourlycantbsrs,6,Sun May 31 20:43:38 2015 UTC,"Well first of all the comparison of 10 eggs vs a portion of meat is not fair:   One serving of beef has the same amount of calories as 3 large eggs(only the beef against only the eggs, not counting cooking method). 72 calories each egg vs 213 calories 3 oz of ground beef.    Second, even it was:  1 calorie of eggs causes the death of around 20 times more animals than 1 calorie of beef.  http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/want-to-kill-fewer-animals-give-up-eggs-not-meat/  So even consuming 1 egg a day you are responsible of killing the sane amount of animals than someone who eats 2 big steaks a day(700 calories each).  So if vegetarians weren't hypocrites and really cared about animals but wanted to keep consuming animal products for some reason (instead of being honest with themselves and going vegan) eating large animals would make much more sense than consuming eggs."
vegetarian,37ztr8,adrenalive,2,Sun May 31 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"Hold up one minute. 3 oz of beef is the size of a deck of playing cards. Just think for a moment how small that is. Now think of a burger from any restaurant. It's at least twice that size, if not more. And a steak or a piece of chicken is WAY bigger than a deck of cards. I used google for my calorie counts and did some rough math. So maybe a normal omnivore's ""serving"" of steak would be equal to the calories in 5-6 eggs. That's still an absurd amount of eggs and I've never heard of anyone, vegetarian, omnivorous, or otherwise, eating that many eggs in one sitting, and especially not on a regular basis.  Another huge reason why people go vegetarian is for environmental reasons. I still eat dairy and eggs, but not in their ""plain"" forms. I haven't eaten an egg that wasn't in a cake/brownie/cookie in months, well before I stopped eating meat. I use about two tablespoons of milk per day in my coffee, and I eat a bit of cheese most days. It's all about reducing impact, not being perfect. If we expected everyone (including ourselves) to be absolutely perfect, not harming anyone or anything, we'd be shit outta luck.  It's all about doing your best. For me, that's eating no meat or sentient fish. I avoid most dairy and eggs for ethical/environmental reasons, but for social situations and personal indulgence, I'll eat baked goods that use animal products (but not meat itself) on occasion. I realize there's a level of hypocrisy here, but it feels right for me, for now. It's possible that for the same reasons I'll never understand people who take 2 minute showers then eat a cheeseburger, while still calling themselves environmentalists, is exactly how you'll never understand people who eat eggs and dairy, but call themselves ethicists."

I just find it funny that a lot vegetarians feel like they are saving animals by not eating meat, while calling meat eaters murderers and irresponsible. While in reality a light meat eater saves much more animals and the animals they kill usually live much better lives than chickens (they probably have the worst of all farm animal lives)."
vegetarian,37ztr8,adrenalive,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"I totally agree and before I decided to fully remove all land and air animals from my diet, I had read up on the ethics of beef vs chicken. Beef probably does less killing, but more damage to the planet. Totally getting rid of both products made that simpler for me!  I also agree that it's stupid if vegetarians feel like they're doing good by not eating meat, but are hypocritical for calling meat-eaters murderers. The most I can say about it, however, is that the vegetarian has made some steps to help the planet/their health/direct killing of animals for food, while the meat eater probably hasn't done much research and doesn't care much at all."

It takes a lot of energy and wastes a lot of resources to grow that many fish just for consumption.  3.) Overfishing in areas of the world is leading to pretty serious problems in aquatic ecosystems because the demand for fish is depleting the population of certain species at a really high rate.  It's good to be vegetarian for reasons related to animal ethics - but its best to keep your eating and consumption habits at a lower scale of resource consumption. There is nothing ""low resource"" about huge boats wasting a ton of energy to catch giant nets of fish while endangering other animals that get caught in them and then having to ship those fish across the country/world.  I'm on mobile so linking to research isn't great, but I'm sure if you do some quick research on fish farming and overfishing you will see the environmental damage that it causes and the very confined areas that fish are grown in."

Pain is a complex state, with a distinct perceptual quality but also associated with suffering, which is an emotional state. Because of this complexity, the presence of pain in an animal, or another human for that matter, cannot be determined unambiguously using observational methods, but the conclusion that animals experience pain is often inferred on the basis of likely presence of phenomenal consciousness which is deduced from comparative brain physiology as well as physical and behavioural reactions.

Yes, you tried to explain yourself, but it's very clear you haven't done your research.   Fish are absolutely farmed, and the conditions on those farms are terrible. Additionally to what others have said, farmed fish escapees have a negative impact on the genepools of wild populations.  Do you eat things like shrimp and other invertebrates? Most shrimp are harvested from farms in southeast Asia that are cleared mangrove forests. This results in a ton of habitat destruction. I'm sure this scenario is not unique.  Even fishing from the wild is absolutely devastating. Enough others have weighed in on that so I won't go into depth, but MBARI has some very accessible information on this.  So even if you hold the bizarre but widely accepted belief that fish and aquatic inverts exist below some arbitrary threshold and don't feel pain, there are plenty of purely ecological reasons to stay away from them."

Somewhere we have to decide what kind of life we're okay with ending (insect? mollusc?). I guess some divisions are more natural than others, but there definitely is a distinction between the intelligence of fish and mammals, and probably even between fish and poultry. If someone wants to draw the line there, I don't feel the need to tell them otherwise.   Personally, I don't eat fish because the way we harvest it is so unsustainable, and it's been easier for me to just cut it out of my diet than try to figure out exactly what the maximum categorical-imperative-appeasing amount of fish might be.

Secondly, fish are raised on factory farms, & even when they aren't, they're torturously killed... fishing in oceans is a travesty. Think of all the by-catch... dolphins, turtles... all these creatures, killed on accident & thrown back into the depleted, polluted oceans all so you can have your culinary pleasure. That's not right. I'd encourage you to watch this part of Farm To Fridge by Mercy For Animals about fish, narrated by James Cromwell; starts at 9:20, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzrRmB40l00 ---You don't need fish in your diet at all.

vegetarian,37y8ic,GIS-Rockstar,5,Sun May 31 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of the taste anyway They're treated incredibly inhumanely. I'm really not down with rapidly decompressing and slicing up animals while they're still conscious. I couldn't do it myself, so I don't want to support outsourcing the job Shrimp, crabs, and lobsters are essentially bugs and that's just weird to me Bycatch is very bad. I hate the idea of needlessly harming animals to harvest another. To produce at a global scale, it's inevitable Overfishing, man. I'm a surfer, scuba diver, and environmentalist, and eating fish is usually harmful to ecosystems and the environment   Sure, many of these can be avoided or mitigated, but it's just easier for me to avoid entirely. There are definite hearth benefits, and that's great."
vegetarian,37y8ic,Number_06,6,Sun May 31 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"Mercury, overfishing, and that fish farming is about as environmentally unsound as factory farming on land."
vegetarian,37y8ic,wirkcl,2,Sun May 31 16:11:00 2015 UTC,Mercury is only present in problematic amounts in specific species. Fish in the lower part of the food chain barely have mercury.
vegetarian,37y8ic,IndigoBlue14,3,Sun May 31 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"I am vegetarian for multiple reasons. I think factory farming of meat is especially cruel, but fish have brains, and can feel pain, so it is wrong to kill them for food."
vegetarian,37y8ic,preachyveganchick,3,Sun May 31 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"One of the many reasons is bycatch.   In the words of Jonathan Safran Foer:  Perhaps the quintessential example of bullshit, bycatch refers to sea creatures caught by accident — except not really ""by accident,"" since bycatch has been consciously built into contemporary fishing methods. Modern fishing tends to involve much technology and few fishers. This combination leads to massive catches with massive amounts of bycatch. Take shrimp, for example. The average shrimptrawling operation throws 80 to 90 percent of the sea animals it captures overboard, dead or dying, as bycatch. (Endangered species amount to much of this bycatch.) Shrimp account for only 2 percent of global seafood by weight, but shrimp trawling accounts for 33 percent of global bycatch. We tend not to think about this because we tend not to know about it. What if there were labeling on our food letting us know how many animals were killed to bring our desired animal to our plate? So, with trawled shrimp from Indonesia, for example, the label might read: 26 pounds of other sea animals were killed and tossed back into the ocean for every 1 pound of this shrimp.    Imagine being served a plate of sushi. But this plate also holds all of the animals that were killed for your serving of sushi. The plate might have to be five feet across."
vegetarian,37y8ic,k25l3,5,Mon Jun 1 02:48:33 2015 UTC,"Fish are gross, slimy beings. Shrimp are glorified sea bugs. The ocean is a creepy place filled with creepy things. Fuck anything from the ocean."
vegetarian,37y8ic,blargh9001,2,Sun May 31 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of reading up to do!   Actually they often are raised in cruel confinement, with a host of ecological problems that come with it. Wild fish are caught with enormous factory ships that massively disrupt Eco-systems and have a high rate of bycatch. Even if you don't care for fish - which you should, there is good reason to believe they feel and suffer - a significant amount of mammals, birds and reptiles are killed as bycatch only to be thrown back."
vegetarian,37y8ic,aleibrock,2,Sun May 31 17:39:28 2015 UTC,Mercury. They're also kind of gross. I found this on peta.org (I don't know how I feel about peta but this was informative).   fish farming
vegetarian,37y8ic,apocalypse2morrow,2,Sun May 31 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'm Buddhist.  Many Buddhists believe that abstaining from killing any sentient beings is the most moral way to live your life.  We consider fish to be sentient.  That being said, I believe eating wild fish is more moral than many other options.  It's much healthier for you, easier on the environment (arguably), and less cruel (again, arguably)."
vegetarian,37y8ic,birdy111,2,Mon Jun 1 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"None of that stuff matters as much as, simply, not causing pain. I was raised pescetarian. I have been fishing many times and seen fish killed. I have no doubt that they don't want to die. Quite simply, if I had a live fish in my hands and the choice of throwing it back or killing it, I would throw it back. Ergo, I don't eat fish."
vegetarian,37y8ic,Frank_IV,2,Mon Jun 1 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate here - and to add another layer to OPs perspective;   I have a lot of pescetarian friends (and I've experimented with pescetarianism myself) and a usual point of view is comparing fish/seafood to dairy and eggs.   A lot of pescetarians are ovo-lacto vegetarian justifying eating fish/seafood as a way of consuming less dairy and eggs. Yes, fish and seafood are sentiment beings but some people equates the cruelty of the fishing industry to that of the dairy and egg industries - and compared to dairy and eggs, fish and seafood tends to be more nutritious (once mercury poisoning has been negotiated of course).  Essentially, a lot of pescetarians I know don't consider ovo-lacto vegetarians to be that much more 'ethical' than they are, and perhaps there are environmental reasons fish and seafood is just as bad as dairy and egg farming (someone else might have more info on this). Neither is perfect, but it works for different people.   Most people would agree that veganism is the ultimate moral trump card over both pescetarianism and ovo-lacto vegetarianism anyway."
vegetarian,37y8ic,Exveggie,2,Tue Jun 2 13:38:07 2015 UTC,I find it pathetic that people that consume eggs and milk say that killing fish is wrong lol.   I mean a whole new level of hypocrisy.
vegetarian,37y8ic,unclemusclzhour,1 point,Sun May 31 21:45:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hate the taste of fish. It disgusts me and I've never like it. I also feel bad for fish because they have some conscious mind. On top of that, there are a lot of issues now with us overfishing."

vegetarian,37y8ic,Cryovolcanoes,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"I treat fish as a delicacy, and luckily here in sweden, you can easily find fish from sustainable sources."
vegetarian,37y8ic,ohtheheavywater,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"I do eat fish/seafood, rarely, but my reasons for avoiding it have most to do with sustainability: most species we eat are overfished, there's bycatch, and fish farming creates pollution and interferes genetically with nearby wild populations. Also, fish don't have cute mammal faces but I do think they suffer when we kill them, maybe more than when they die in the wild (slow suffocation as opposed to a quick chomp).   That said I have no qualms, on any of those grounds, about eating oysters. I can't afford to eat them very often but when I do my conscience is clear."
