You can't guarantee the subsidies will be short term or that more won't be needed in future. You have to have a lot of trust in the government that implements them and any other future government that comes a long to tinker with them -- for whatever reason/mandate.   If it works, great. But there's no guarantee. If it fails, it can be as bad if not worse than the open market."

Corbyn saying you cannot cut your way to prosperity (yeah, I know what he means...) but he really just wants to make different cuts of his own (""corporate subsidies"").  Trouble with excessive nationalisation is that while you may plug the market failure gap, you simply replace that by opening the political incentives door. Just look at Fannie MAe and Freddie Mac in the US.  Ultimately there isn't that much between a private company and a public one other than in terms of the specific people running the show and how people chose to perceive one as inherently good and the other as inherently worse."
LabourUK,3e6po7,ex-turpi-causa,2,Wed Jul 22 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that only making cuts is not the way forward; there needs to be investment as well. And when there are increased cuts, they need to be made to those that would feel it the least i.e. large corporations."

I'm not sure anyone supports only making cuts. The principle behind cutting public expenditure is to allow more room for alternative sources of financing and investment, namely the private sector (banks and other businesses etc), to plug the gap and drive it forward.   This goes for infrastructure as much as anything else -- alternative assets for private portfolios in infrastructure are a thing nowadays, even if they also require significant public sector incentivisation (depending on the project)."

The index also reveals that many tenants in Scotland are struggling to keep up with rent rises, with 9% of all rent paid late, up from previous figures.  Over 100,000 tenants in the private rented sector live in poverty, according the the [sic] Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  We've called for the SNP Government in Edinburgh to wake up to the reality of the private rented sector, and back plans to reform the rental market.  Last year the SNP voted against our plans to ban rip off rent rises in the private rental sector in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2014.

Moving Labour over to the right is no longer the shocking move it was back in the clause 4 days, nor does it seem particularly modern. In fact it seems pretty retro, much like how The Smiths were daring and modern in the late 80's but are now at home on Radio 2.

Bit off the point but I don't think we can say we live in a society where we believe 'merit not background should determine success' when we have a monarchy and a PM who went to Eton.   I'm sure somewhere Lenin's looking up at Blair and having a good old chuckle about him calling radical leftism reactionary. It's used by both the centre and the far left to describe each other, ultimately they're both wrong, people are reactionary, ideologies aren't   I think Blair does far lefties within Labour a great disrespect, him saying he wouldn't want to win on an old fashioned leftist platform is basically saying there is no place for them in the Labour party anymore.  Seems like a far cry from him holding weekly meeting with Dennis Skinner in his first term.   Blair whipping out the change card, it really is marching on again. Blair sees himself as the moderniser, everyone who disagrees with him is just living in the past.  His one-liners line seems to me a jab, rightly, at Andy Burnham. But lets not forget Blair was the king of this, in and out of campaigns.   Blair would know all too much about developing the wrong kind of dialogue with business.  We won elections when we had an agenda that was driven by spin and broken promises. Blair was a small c-conservative, the left had nothing to do with it.  We won because we learned how to play politics, we just forgot how to stop playing them and start governing once we got in.  Honestly this entire speech was vague fluff from start to finish. Blair talked about talking about things, but how about mentioning shit which hasn't been mentioned by any of the leadership candidates so far, like mental health? It affects 1 in 4 people and barely gets a mention by anyone other than the lib dems.   If you want to appeal to people, star talking about stuff that actually affects them rather than why moving Labour left would be bad.

He also says British people should vote Labour, incidentally, though not in an entirely positive way.   We won elections when we had an agenda that was driven by spin and broken promises. Blair was a small c-conservative, the left had nothing to do with it.   Less poverty, more hospitals, shorter waiting lists, better schools, more working class kids in uni. He also kept promises about taxation, which I don't expect any of Corbyn's supporters would be complaining about if he had broken them.  So, basically, we've got not nationalising the rail and tuition fees for 'broken promises', the latter of which was part of a package of reforms which, as I said already, got more working class kids into uni.  By the way, find me the political leader who keeps all their promises.  The rest of your response is kind of entirely pointless. Blair isn't in charge of party policy or an expert in mental health.

That says pretty much zilch about how effective he'll be as leader, just a biased opinion on ideology coupled with some honestly quite immature behaviour from Tory supporters.  You could even argue they're at the second stage of Gandhi's famous saying: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.'   “[Labour] misunderstand the difference between radical leftism, which is often in fact quite reactionary – and radical social democracy, which is all about ensuring that values are put to work in the most effective way,” he said.   Dat thought-terminating cliché.  No substance as to why radical leftism is bad, just throw a vapid negative at its supporters and move on.  New Labour must be better, because it's progress!   “Let me make my position clear: I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform. Even if I thought it was the route to victory, I wouldn’t take it.”   At least he's nailed his colours to the mast for all to see.  Blair's use of centrism was never a ruse to get power in an apparently right-wing electorate, it was always his intended ideology.   He later added: “Even if you did [win] it wouldn’t be right because it wouldn’t take the country “forward, it would take it backwards. That’s why it’s not the right thing to do.""   So making a stand against poverty, inequality, vested interests and the destruction of the environment is backwards now?  Well, this explains a lot about the Blair years...  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand Blair.  Yes, he won three elections.  Margaret Thatcher also won three elections.  Yes, he did some good things in power.

Has it occurred to you that being laughed at in no way suggests that you're eventually going to win?   No substance as to why radical leftism is bad   The substance is: It's bad because it's reactionary; it's reactionary because it wants to take things back to how they were in the past, despite the fact that those things have been widely discredited. Corbyn's whole outlook is near-identical to the Bennite outlook he's been pushing for thirty-two years as an MP. You cannot deal with 2015 problems with 1983 solutions, especially not when those 'solutions' were comprehensively rejected by the electorate.   At least he's nailed his colours to the mast for all to see. Blair's use of centrism was never a ruse to get power in an apparently right-wing electorate, it was always his intended ideology.   The emphasis in the sentence: 'I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform' should fall on 'old-fashioned', not 'leftist'. Indeed, Blair makes this clear in a section that you quote yourself when he says it would 'take the country backwards', which you somehow see as being in favour of:   poverty, inequality, vested interests and the destruction of the environment   This is a collossal failure to argue with any sense of the principle of charity -- unless, of course, we're reading different articles and Blair actually said 'I'm against eliminating poverty, inequality and vested interests, and what has the environment ever done for us?'  Two of those Blair definitely took steps to tackle (poverty, destruction of the environment); one of those he had a more qualified success (inequality went up but the effects of inequality mostly decreased); on vested interests he did a lot to root out corruption in the government (the level of corruption in the '90s was insane), but that's a job that's never completed.   Yes, he did some good things in power. Any Labour leader would have done those things   Not if they hadn't gotten elected. Also, can you really be arguing that all the good things Blair did were things any leader would've done but all the bad things were due to his unique character flaws?   It's statements like this that just make me really question whether his commitment to Labour values   Reduces poverty. Rescues NHS. Rescues schools. Gets more working class kinds into uni. Is questioned for his loyalty for suggesting that the fact that he's spent his entire political career watching radical leftists lose elections is a good reason to suspect that they lose elections.

The emphasis is on the 'You could even argue that', as in it's one possible explanation for what is about to happen.  I'm not suggesting that being laughed at implies winning at all, just that it's perfectly feasible that Jeremy'll pass straight through the phase of being the 'unelectable loony leftie' and into having the last laugh.   The substance is: It's bad because it's reactionary; it's reactionary because it wants to take things back to how they were in the past, despite the fact that those things have been widely discredited.   By whom?  There's this received wisdom that the post-war consensus is somehow inherently broken, but I haven't ever seen anything that isn't basically either coming from the free-market outriders, or just saying 'the public have been told X is the solution to their problems, and nobody has made a credible and sustained argument since 1979 that Y would be better, thus X must be correct'.  Sorry to wade into Milibandesque cliché, but the past brought us the NHS, the welfare state, and the comprehensive rebuilding of a country devastated by war.  What do we have now?  Increasing poverty, increasing inequality, people committing suicide because the system has consistently failed them, and yet the City is rolling in the dough and all the things our grandfathers built are being sold off at losses.  I'm sorry, but we do have a lot to learn from the past, and the constant writing off of it as irrelevant or discredited without actually exploring why we and the electorate at large think that is counter-productive.   You cannot deal with 2015 problems with 1983 solutions   Suppose Jeremy's solutions really are exactly the same ones proposed in 1983.  What makes these solutions unusable here?  Scrapping Trident (unilateral disarmament, 1983 solution) could save a large amount of money that the government would then be able to use to either fund, say, expansion of council houses (2015 problem!) or even pay down the deficit (2015 problem!).  I admit that I'm not in the company of cold, hard figures here, but it's certainly worth arguing as a point rather than sweeping under pithy generalisations.  And let's talk about (shock horror!) renationalisation.  One of Ed Miliband's flagship policies, which was freezing the energy prices, appears to have been quite grounded in public opinion.  Would not a nationalised energy infrastructure (1983 solution) help to solve the 2015 problem of high energy prices, low satisfaction, and profits going nowhere near the taxpayer?   especially not when those 'solutions' were comprehensively rejected by the electorate.   Firstly, we're talking one election 33 years ago now.  That's hardly a great indicator of what's going to happen in 2020, which is a year we haven't even passed now.  Secondly, 1983 was by no means a clear-cut left-right election: Labour had only just lost power, Thatcher was boosted by the Falklands, and by all accounts Labour's manifesto was badly marketed and targeted.  No, I'm not saying that any one of these is the sole reason we lost.  I'm just saying that it's not a perfect indicator of 1983 views, let alone 2015.  And if we're bringing 2015 into it, yes, we do need to bring former-Labour/LibDem-gone-Tory voters into it.  But lo!  many of those voters abandoned us because of perceptions, not because of principles.  They want a welfare state that's there for those who need it and nobody else.  They want immigration to work for them.  They want a strong economy--who doesn't?--and Labour have spent 5 years failing to convince anyone that anything other than austerity works, so why should people think anti-austerity is credible?   The emphasis in the sentence: 'I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform' should fall on 'old-fashioned', not 'leftist'. Indeed, Blair makes this clear in a section that you quote yourself when he says it would 'take the country backwards'   I agree that my argument here was weak, but I'll try to defend it.  Given that the main argument I hear against a leftist platform is that it would be unelectable, and Blair took this one caveat away in his hypothetical situation, I don't see where his argument is going.  Call me biased, but I don't see anything the left is arguing for that is inherently contemptuous to the social democrat, with the exception of things like unilateral disarmament and foreign relations.  My point was that, since the left tend to go for the minimum compromise on achieving the ends I illustrated, then surely with no need to compromise then insisting on the middle ground comes across as being insincere.  (Admittedly, I didn't think about the economy when I was suggesting this--oh, the irony! I hear you cry.  But there is a strong movement, posted about several times in this very subreddit, that an anti-austerity growth-based economy would actually be more suitable than austerity for growing the country.)  Again, this whole rhetoric about things being 'old-fashioned' and 'taking the country backwards' is vapid appeal to novelty that doesn't address at all why there's anything wrong with an argument that has been made for decades (except its own failure to break through, perhaps).  Neoliberalism is rooted in 19th century schools of thought, so I'd say Blair is the one taking the country backwards and being old-fashioned.   Not if they hadn't gotten elected.   And we have a crystal ball that we can use to see that they wouldn't have?  Sure, we can get into what-if arguments until the cows come home, but 1997 wasn't exactly a scrape-through, nor was it entirely free of the we're-sick-of-Tories-and-want-a-change effect.  I disagree that Blair was necessary to win.   Also, can you really be arguing that all the good things Blair did were things any leader would've done but all the bad things were due to his unique character flaws?   The good things are all in line with Labour's purpose as a party, so yes, I do think any leader would have done them.  As for the bad things, no, I'm not saying they're unique character flaws: many MPs voted for Iraq, many people bought into New Labour, etc.  It's an occupational hazard that, as the leader (and maybe he did become leader based on his character foibles, sure!), he happens to be the biggest exponent for the things that went well and wrong in the New Labour era.   Rescues NHS   Starts privatisation and re-organisation of it.  Continued and expanded the use of PFIs despite Labour opposing them initially.   Rescues schools   Starts the academy system, albeit in a much reduced form, I concede.   Gets more working class kinds into uni.   Tuition fees.  Also, what of the argument that, by making university a route for the masses, New Labour devalued university to the point where it's now simultaneously necessary to get an entire broad class of jobs and prohibitively expensive for some talented but poor school-leavers?  Not a leftist argument I know, but one that gets bounded about a fair bit.   Is questioned for his loyalty for suggesting that the fact that he's spent his entire political career watching radical leftists lose elections is a good reason to suspect that they lose elections.   If you're going to make the argument elsewhere that we can get in with a moderate stance at the ballot box and then do progressive things in government, then why did that not apply to Blair?  Is the argument flawed?  Did Blair just not want to use his political capital to make the differences that apparently 'radical leftists' are inherently utterly incapable of getting past the electorate?"

First Round: Corbyn 43%, Burnham 29.6%, Cooper 27.2%. Cooper's second preference vote will more than likely go to Burnham in greater numbers than Corbyn. Say Burnham gets 5/6 and Corbyn 1/6. Corbyn 47.5%, Burnham 52.5% and Burnham is elected.   So leading the first preference isn't the only thing unless he gets flat out over 50% which seems unlikely. These numbers are of course hypothetical, but to me they seem reasonable estimates. Add on to that the fact that 20% of Labour supporters ""Havn't made their mind up yet"". So it's still all to play for."
LabourUK,3e4gbg,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Wed Jul 22 09:14:27 2015 UTC,I think there's another tweet that makes it 53% Corbyn and 47% Burnham in final round.

So if this poll is to be believed, does this mean there are people who are putting Kendall as their first preference, and Corbyn as their second?  Or is this simply that the people who put Kendall first, and then no further preference are eliminated, thus shrinking the electorate and therefore raising the percent?

If the public gets told that centre right is the new left and hard right is the new right then the middle gradually moves until what was once a mainstream right wing position becomes the new political centre.   Winning elections is important, but so is contesting the battle of ideas that decide where the political centre ground will be. If the tories are extremely likely to win the next election, assuming an average leader on both sides (and I think they are likely to do so thanks to the combo of boundary fixing, SNP dominance and proliferating third parties in England under FPTP) then perhaps it is better for Labour to try and move the centre ground for a while rather than chasing it ever rightwards. Perhaps that is actually the principled position that saves more suffering in the medium term?  It's not as simple as a binary choice between wallowing in a comfort zone or making 'hard choices' to move to the right and waiting for the inevitable election victory. Blair didn't win elections purely on moving to (what was) the political centre in his day, he also crafted a strong message of hope and bound it up in his personal charisma and rhetorical skill. If you just move to the centre and forget about the message of hope and chose a candidate without the political charisma then you'll just get the traditional result when a party of the left tries to chase a party of the right; the electorate chooses the real thing rather than the imitation."

You listen to the electorate, show them that you are listening and then you get a chance to govern - and then you can start moving people's opinion in the direction you want."
LabourUK,3e4qi0,puttie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:39:04 2015 UTC,"Well it assumes two things: 1) that there is an election 'winner' candidate among the non-Corbyn alternatives. Honestly there almost certainly isn't. The best Liz, Andy or Yvette could hope for is a total Tory collapse unseen since the tail end of the Thatcher era, after which they still won under Major.  2) That what new Labour did was the same as what the Tories have been doing. New Labour seemed to try and 'smuggle' leftish policies in by cloaking them in right wing rhetoric. Meanwhile the Tories seem to be building popular support for right wing opinions & policies through a mix of false narratives and repetition.  Of course everything is easier from a position of power, it'd be nice if Labour had five or six compliant newspaper editors too, but if power isn't really on the cards then I'd rather we pursued the recent Tory strategy than the New Labour one as I think the 'smuggling' plan builds up trouble for later."

It has driven me absolutely mad in the last few days how many Labour supporters seem willing to do our rivals' jobs for us and completely misrepresent our views as a party. I can understand why the SNP want to lie and say that we aren't opposing things properly, and I can understand why the Tories want to portray us as ""in chaos"". But why the hell are our own people repeating this nonsense?  Labour MPs voted to oppose the bill. They raised amendments trying to change the bill. They refused to support (by abstaining) the bill's second reading, but didn't want to vote against it seeing as it had a raft of our own bloody manifesto pledges in there (alongside a bunch of nasty stuff). They've vowed to vote against it fully at the third reading if their amendments aren't accepted.   And yet apparently that's ""swallowing the Tory narrative"" or some such rubbish."

LabourUK,3e3c7h,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"The bill is a train wreck.

If you vote for - you're the worst kind of scum, welfare cuts blah blah.  If you oppose - You're opposed to 3 million apprenticeships! Congratulations on not giving a toss about young people.  The social justice voters are never going to twig that last point. The bill should be pulled apart and bits put through seperately but the Tories would never do that because then Labour could pick and choose what they wanted to support (the way it should be). They know if they group the good stuff with the bad stuff Labour will abstain and lefties will scream murder."

Being the former doesn't automatically make you the latter. Furthermore, I think there's  rather a lot of Jews in this country who have a fairly critical opinion of Israel's actions of late.  I see no problem recognising Palestine; I don't want to be overly optimistic, but a two-state solution could potentially lead to less violence in the ME than is seen today. That the government supposedly believes in an independent Palestine as well, it makes sense for us to put pressure on them as to why they haven't taken any steps to further this aim, i.e. being the first Western power to recognise Palestinian statehood.   This isn't some issue of the loony left; it's the right thing to do and most of the public think so too."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,Moinmoiner,8,Tue Jul 21 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Let's not forget Israel are relentlessly violated a huge amount of UN resolutions, including the Geneva convention building settlements on land which isn't theirs and dumping their waste onto adjacent farmland.  To add to that, they've been documented committing war crimes.  1) Firing white phosphorous over residential areas, a chemical that rains from the sky and burns through flesh, cannot be put out by water.  2) Using kids as human shields forcing them to stay in front of their armoured Humvees, sending them in first when performing house raids etc etc.  There are also countless reports of ex-IDF soldiers that say they systematically abuse Palestinian children abducting them from their homes and forcing them to confess to crimes they've never committed.  And what's more, THEY BOMBED A UN SCHOOL IN GAZA. Can you just imagine, for a split second, what would happen if Iran did something like that. There should be an overwhelming majority of people in the commons calling for economic sanctions to be put on Israel until they stop this extremely reckless illegal activity. Until they do, they are by definition a rogue state.  EDIT: Formatting."

I have not actually mentioned my position on the argument. All I have done is suggest that there are reasonable positions on both sides of the argument about recognising Palestine now, and for that you've accused me of aiding and abetting genocide."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:39:06 2015 UTC,"Liz doesn't understand the difference between 'Jewish', and 'Zionist'   this is a familiar refrain from the anti-Israel brigade but I don't see where you inferred this from the article.

LabourUK,3e1w9q,Moinmoiner,3,Tue Jul 21 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"No-one's saying that working towards a two-state solution is a bad idea. Lots of people who want that oppose recognising Palestinian statehood because they think it's unhelpful for eventually reaching a just, two-nation peace.  Incidentally, I suspect Liz Kendall, the holder of a first-class degree in History from Cambridge University, is capable of understanding the difference between Jews and Zionists."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Tue Jul 21 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"“The question asked about hostility [between Labour and the Jewish community] and I think that really did come to a crunch in the vote on the House of Commons on recognizing the Palestinian state,”  I'm sure she does understand the difference, but, to me at least, in this quote she seems to equate being Jewish and not recognising Palestinian statehood. Whether she meant that, or not, that's certainly how it comes across.   Just out of interest, if you do support a two-state solution, why wouldn't you support recognising Palestine? Surely upholding the Palestinian Authority to the same expectations (rights as well as responsibilities) as the Israeli government will make a just two-state solution more likely, wouldn't it?"
LabourUK,3e1w9q,Moinmoiner,5,Tue Jul 21 13:15:21 2015 UTC,"There were several articles, in the Guardian, the New Statesman and elsewhere, commenting on Labour's poor relationship with the Jewish community and suggesting that this was partly a result of our attitude towards Israel/Palestine. Most opinion polling shows that this area remains a top priority for many Jews and Muslims, so I don't think she's crazy to suggest that there's a link, there. Certainly she's not alone in doing so.  As for the two-state solution, I do support it, but I honestly don't know where I stand on when it's appropriate to recognise Palestine. Some people argue that when it's being ruled by Hamas, an internationally-recognised terrorist group, it's not a great time to say that it's a state.  Others suggest that until the status of Jerusalem is solved (both Israel and Palestine claim it as their capital), recognising Palestinian statehood will do more harm than good.  Still more say that recognising Palestine simply won't achieve anything: Unless there's a negotiated peace, Israel can simply carry on doing what it's doing while refusing to recognise Palestinian statehood (it's no stranger to flouting UN conventions, after all), and that recognising Palestine will make it harder to get Israel to negotiate a peace, not easier.  Overall, I'm extremely glad I'm not a politician so I don't have to take a firm position on this. My point is simply that Liz Kendall's position on Palestinian statehood should not necessarily be regarded as support for Israel in general or support for the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, and certainly not as support for every action the Israeli government has ever undertaken."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"That's very interesting, actually. I mean I still stand by what I said; that by recognising the statehood of Palestine and treating it as we would any other nation would be more conducive to the peace process, I appreciate that it's a horribly messy situation and that there's no easy answers.  With regards to Kendall, what bugs me is that she never clarified why she feels it was the wrong thing to do. I'd have been satisfied by any of the reasons you've cited above, but there wasn't really any proper grounding for her opposition. Maybe I'm being unfair and she was just never given opportunity, or they were omitted from the article, but I think it's something fairly important to know."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,Patch86UK,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"It depends how long they had to answer, really. There's probably a more complete transcript, somewhere.  EDIT: This is the best statement I could find about her views on the conflict:   The urgent priority must be to secure an immediate ceasefire. However, our ultimate goal must be not just an end to the war, but a strategy for building the peace. I will continue to press for an end to the violence, terror and blockade in Gaza and to a negotiated two state solution, which is the only way to bring lasting security and justice to the Israeli and Palestinian people.   So, if she doesn't think recognising statehood is likely to lead to a ceasefire, it's a consistent position."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,CaptainHayashi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"“The question asked about hostility [between Labour and the Jewish community] and I think that really did come to a crunch in the vote on the House of Commons on recognizing the Palestinian state,”   That's not an unreasonable sentiment. While there is a big difference between Zionist and Jewish, it's also undeniably true that support for Israel is very high and passionately held by a large part of the British Jewish community. To take (what some would regard as) an ""anti-Israel"" position would certainly contribute to the disillusionment with Labour among Jewish voters.  For the record, I supported and continue to support Labour's move to recognise Palestinian statehood. It's just that that doesn't stop me recognising the fact that that position influences some voters here in the UK."
LabourUK,3e1w9q,Subotan,7,Tue Jul 21 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"My local CLP, this year and a couple of years ago, had a member go to Palestine with the Labour2Palestine group.  Both times, they came back with an extremely harrowing account of the situation in the West Bank, and the often arbitrary restrictions placed on Palestinian citizens by their illegal occupiers.  Palestine is not entirely blameless in this conflict.  But that entirely fails to justify Israel's treatment of civilians (and it almost always is civilians, from their rule in the West Bank to their targets in attacks).

Jeremy Corbyn said he was not in favour of a generalised boycott of Israel but that he supported an arms embargo on the country and a boycott of products from the occupied territories.""

I have seen nothing but derogatory comments made by a certain subset of the members of this subreddit towards anyone who has the audacity to share Corbyn's political leanings.

However, we both felt that the shitposting had come to a head over the last few days, with particularly shitty discussions in this thread and another, with clear cases of downvoting reasonable posts for no reason other than disagreement. We felt that the shitposting was contributing to the heavy-handed downvoting (you're more likely to hit the downvote button on a good post if another post has just pissed you off) and that both were creating a hositle environment.  As for the right-leaning shit posts, I know who you're talking about and I agree that a lot of their contributions are not very good. The difference, however, is that most of their really bad comments are rapidly and justifiably downvoted, including by me, whereas the comment above was at +4 at the time I issued the warning."

Absolutely, the hateful shitposting has coloured the debate in this subreddit, meaning that even the well-thought out responses end up getting hostile, thus making no actual, reasonable discussion possible.  The saddest part is - this isn't even contained to this subreddit, this is what is happening to the entire Labour party as a whole, and why the state of the contest is what it is right now... I joined the party after the election, and already I'm growing disillusioned, not because I think Labour is too left wing or too right wing, but because everyone in the party is so horrible to each other..."

As someone who joined back in 2011, we were all pretty friendly with Ed in charge -- it's true about him preserving party unity. Hopefully, after the leadership contest, much of the negativity will die down, we can rally behind our new leader and start organising to win."

Revolting though the Budget is, we could not have prevented it."
LabourUK,3e2e2s,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Tue Jul 21 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"That there was no way of preventing it doesn't mean that opposing it is entirely useless.  It's about sending different messages, and it seems the party is split as to whether it wants to send the message of 'this welfare bill is entirely contemptuous and we can't possibly support it', or 'we want to be seen as tough on welfare without entirely agreeing with the Tories'.  It probably surprises nobody that I'm in the former camp.  I would argue that the latter, if what was intended by Harman, was not the message that Labour ended up sending out last night."

They love being part of the biggest trading city on earth, even if they themselves play only a small role. So how come it's a Labour bastion?  What they are looking for from govt isn't planned economies that will trash their beloved metropolis, but services that will make London work. They like the NHS, the Oyster Card and so on, and associate all with Labour - so Labour gets a lot of props and votes from them.  I'm pretty sure this is the case in other parts of the UK too - eg Manchester is a pro-business city that is run entirely by labour. There is a way to be 21st century and be Labour as well."

It would also include the government creating state-owned corporations to compete/fill in gaps where the private sector isn't currently expanding/performing well. Michael Meacher, a close associate of his, wrote a whole book outlining their proposals.  What it does not mean is implementing a one-party authoritarian state, which is the government model, not the economic model. Democratic states (Japan, South Korea, Singapore) employ this economic model as well."

LabourUK,3e1muk,Patch86UK,3,Tue Jul 21 07:01:52 2015 UTC,"If someone would like to post summaries/reactions for each one, that'd be great. I'll start with Stella's because, frankly, I'm slightly in love with her.    Obviously, Stella's all about the community organising, so it's not surprising that she focusses on that. Here, she's mainly talking about how our campaigning during election time should be informed by our community work during all other times, invoking Joe Hill's famous dictum of 'Don't mourn, organize'.   one of the lessons we must also take from our election defeat is a willingness to ask if our campaigning approach, which saw thousands of volunteers working incredible hours to knock thousands of doors, needs to change too. Too often, a member’s knock at the door will be greeted with a reply that ""we only ever see you at election time – you just want one thing""   She's not the first to offer a similar critique of our campaigning, which was heavy on boots on the ground and low on actual interaction. She argues that community work is the way to fix this and that we can make a difference when we're not in power:   Being out of office does not mean we are out of power – we can campaign now for change to show the public what we stand for.   She suggests this is a win-win: We help communities now and in doing so we make it more likely we'll win and find ourselves able to do still more to help them.  She then offers some suggestions of how this can be brought about using the structures we have now (and adding some new ones):   That’s why I am proposing measures such as a development officer for Young Labour, to help us build the leadership skills of our younger members and supporters to be able to in turn recruit their peers to Labour.   A decent idea to engage more young people with Labour and politics in general.   We also need an academy for campaigning to help build the skills and networks of future Labour activists including councillors, organisers and CLP secretaries.   A similar idea. It'll be interesting to see exactly what form these take.   advances in technology make it possible to change the way we campaign, so that we can really get to the heart of what makes voters tick, and build long term relationships with them as individuals   Stella already has a decent discussion area on her website, showing one way we can use technology more effectively than in the past.   As well as a dedicated diversity fund to support the involvement of those currently underrepresented in our movement...   (Which would presumably include youth, as mentioned above...)   ... I want us to directly match-fund new campaigns and projects to engage with communities   Another actual policy suggestion. Again, I think this is a good idea. We have the membersnet campaign area but it doesn't work that well. Stella seems to have some serious ideas about making it work properly, which crucially includes trusting people with money!  She ends with a fairly standard call to action, asking people to support her.    I think that all sounds excellent. The role of Deputy Leader is traditionally a bit vague: What Stella is essentially proposing is to make it into head of community organising for Labour. I think that sounds like a perfect use for the role, as it will a) mean we're taking community organising seriously, as we should do, and b) give a high profile to all our community campaigns."

LabourUK,3e0az6,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"The moral and economic arguments in favour of these cuts is rarely made on this sub, though - mostly because it is so threadbare.  In what sense is cutting the incomes of the poorest and most vulnerable at a time when inequality is the worst it has been in a century a sensible way to ""deal with the problems the country faces""? Which problem are you talking about anyway? If you are concerned about the deficit, then there is a clear choice - keep punishing the poor and make inequality and social mobility even worse, or make those who can afford to pay do so - particularly those who have been avoiding paying their share.  Yes, most people do believe that welfare is too generous. But this belief is based on absurd myths spread by the tories and the right-wing press that do not align with reality. - (a good and more detailed breakdown of welfare misconceptions here.)  If we think the argument is unwinnable and capitulate to the tory narrative in the name of electability, all we do is push the political centre ever rightwards, because the tories will keep moving the goalposts.

Under Blair, it moved left on the minimum wage, gay marriage and even public sector funding. We were able to do that because we were in power.  Labour failed to communicate on this one. We could easily have tabled amendments then abstained because there are parts of the bill we agree with (new apprenticeships, higher minimum wage, some action on non-doms, the principle of a welfare cap). However, Harman failed to do this properly, and this has led to the absurd situation where Labour MPs are pledging to swim through vomit to vote against 300,000 new apprenticeships."

LabourUK,3dzsk6,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. Firstly it's a minimum of a pound. Students can choose to pay more when they join if they feel able to. Servicemen and women are a special case.   Second, there's sound reasoning behind that. They aren't earning. Surely the idea is, as with lots of organisations and businesses, that they will continue to be members once they get a job and then pay full subs.  For me it comes down to this - when I joined I don't remember ticking a box that said that I agree that all decisions are essentially deferred to what the unions, and sometimes just the union leadership want.   If they skew the result by having the candidate chosen in some opaque fashion, then encouraging their members to vote that way, then Labour might have to see if they can survive on union contributions alone. I'm all for union support, if they want to support Labour, but union control is a different thing altogether."

Just off the top of my head:   A two child policy, if followed, would mean we will always require immigration as it's below the replenishment rate. Especially when you consider that poor families tend to have more kids, so those that aren't impacted are likely to have 2 or less kids anyway. Thanks for buying into Miliband Economics George! I'm sooo glad you've changed your mind from three months ago! Missed another deficit reduction target George? What happened since before the election? How many is that you've missed now? Why should we believe this one? Where's the growth George? GDP per capita is flatlining, suggesting that any growth is from immigration and population growth. Is that the ""long term economic plan"" you keep talking about?   I'm sure given a degree in politics and a bit of time I could think of more/refine them further.   The public doesn't agree with all the benefit cuts. They only want to hit the unemployed and the wealthy pensioners, they don't want to see the sick, elderly or families hit. This government is failing on all the metrics it's provided for itself. They've missed more deficit targets than I can count, they're on track to miss their export target. Productivity is stagnant and a nice easy to understand illustration of this is hand car washes, a crystal clear example of what happens in a low wage economy.  What do we get? Nothing.

Tell me, what is the use of our political system if, when one party gets in, the second party decides that the first party got it all right and decides not to oppose things that contravene the party's entire point of existing!?  Of course the electorate are going to back the winning party right after an election where they voted them in!  That isn't at all good evidence of what they'll believe in 2020, because we haven't factored in changes of opinion, changes in circumstance, the argument from the Oppositio- oh wait, the Opposition isn't arguing, it's just mindlessly agreeing because it thinks this is what the electorate will want from them.  Yes, voters want a cut-down benefit system right now (assuming that they do, and that our research and the election aren't far off the mark here).  That does NOT mean:   The same voters will be voting in 2020; They'll feel the same way in 2020 even if the Opposition doesn't do anything to argue against it (the economic situation will be different, possibly even people's priorities will be different); They'll be utterly resistant to arguments in the next five years (remember that five years is actually a long time in politics: Labour turned an embarrassing defeat in 1992 to a landslide in 97 despite having lost its leader in 94--to which extent this was the Blair effect is an argument for the ages); They are utterly closed off to anything that isn't a whole-scale thrashing of people who are on benefits, including people who deserve them; They won't be affected personally by the next five years of austerity.   No, none of these is our golden path to victory.  But if we're going to flay other Labour members alive for 'blaming the electorate', can we at least give the electorate credit for being a constantly fluctuating, changing, receptive body of people and not a thick immobile wall that anything left of watered-down Tory policies will crash straight into?"

No use at all. Lucky that's not what's going on here even slightly, then...   “I am determined that we will fight this regressive bill line by line, word by word in committee,” [Burnham said].   Burnham said that as leader he would oppose the proposed limit on child tax credits to two children per family and that he would vote against the bill at third reading if the government did not make major changes to it during committee stage.    So what Burnham's saying is that he accepts that the Welfare system could stand a few tweaks here and there, but he doesn't support what's in the government's bill. So he's going to amend it to buggery, and then vote against it if his amendments don't get their way.  You may or may not agree with this position, but it's a million miles from...   just mindlessly agreeing because it thinks this is what the electorate will want from them.   Personally, I can't see the point of an Opposition that just votes against everything ""because they're the Opposition"", losing every single vote because they don't have a majority.

All that is being claimed is that we should be prepared to challenge the public narrative where we believe the narrative flies in the face of reality and sense.  This doesn't mean agreeing wholesale to what the Tories are saying, and it doesn't mean just voting against everything for the sake of it. It means having a proper debate and discussion to try and convince people over to our side. If we believe the budget proposals on welfare are wrong, then we should stand against it and make the case to the public why we believe they are wrong.   We can't just appease the Tory narrative and hope the public will choose to vote Labour over Tory, we have to actively and passionately challenge the points we disagree with, else the only narrative that will ever be accepted by the public is the Tory one.  Here we have just said we'd agree/abstain with the Tory proposals except with a few tweaks, even though as a party this welfare bill isn't what we actually want. We've made this decision without even having a proper debate or discussion on whether the bill should be agreed or abstained with..  An opposition's duty is to question the narrative that the government presents, not to reject it for the sake of rejecting, or to agree with it, just simply to call out and make the case of where we believe it is wrong.

Burnham has said that we will raise a detailed amendment (or set of amendments) outlining exactly what the Labour Party thinks, and we will debate it ""line for line"", and that if we don't get our way we will vote against it.  I just flat out don't understand why nominally Labour supporting people are so absolutely tooth-and-nail desperate to find a reason to criticise the PLP. It's like we have a fetish for calling ourselves shit, and need to start inventing reasons for it when no other reasons exist. Burnham has said he opposes it. He says he plans on debating it practically to death at committee stage. He says that if Labour don't get their way, we're going to oppose it at the third reading (the one that actually matters). He says that Harman's stance on abstaining at second reading (this one) isn't the approach he would have taken, but there's no point rebelling on it if we're going to do all that with amendments/third reading anyway. He's said this is because of his stance on rebelling/cabinet collective responsibility, rather than his stance on abstaining (which he has already made public).   We can't just appease the Tory narrative and hope the public will choose to vote Labour over Tory, we have to actively and passionately challenge the points we disagree with, else the only narrative that will ever be accepted by the public is the Tory one.   If you want is someone to set out an alternative narrative, that's exactly what Burnham is doing- using the legislative process to put in black and white what Labour's views on this are (via amendments), and either get them implemented (because the Tories are desperate for our support) of have them voted down in a blaze of glory.

Well here's an interesting point, the vote won 308 (apparently 22 Tory MPs were so against the welfare bill they defied their own party whip) to 124. Had the 184 Labour MPS who abstained instead voted against the bill, the result would have been  308 to 308  You may observe, this would have been draw, at which point the speaker would have to put their own vote in. Now as it's the first reading, he would have voted for continued discussion, so the government would still win, but the narrative would have been very different.  Imagine that, had Labour been an actual opposition, whilst the government would still get its bill passed, tomorrow morning we would be seeing headlines saying how Cameron is unable to control the majority of his house. The Conservatives would then start haemorrhaging support as the Tory narrative starts to fail.  EDIT: And of course, had we been even stronger in arguing against it, we may have swayed one extra Tory MP or one of the smaller opposition MPs and even defeated the bill..."

The Conservatives will have only whipped this using a minor whip (e.g. a one line whip) as they knew Labour were abstaining. There's no reason to assume that the 22 Tories who didn't vote were doing so because they objected- it might be because they had other important duties that they didn't feel the need to abandon in this case, but would have if they had needed to. They may also have taken advantage of the pairing system.  And as I pointed out above, unless the Tories cave on our amendments, we'll probably be voting against it at Third Reading anyway, so we'll still get a chance to put this to the test.

As with all Kendall speeches it's pretty light on detail, but from what I can see I'm not sure what her point is other than ""people don't like Labour"", which is always her point.  What regulations specifically does she think were nanny statish? The smoking ban? Who on either side would vote to repeal that? What else was there in the last Labour government?  Sure I'd like less government interference. I'd like them to stop fucking about with trade unions, people's freedom of speech, right ot privacy, people's right to assemble. I'd like more regulation on wages and conditions, on what an ""apprenticeship"" can be, on drugs (legalise and regulate), on how the secret services operate.  Without specifics it's just nonsense statements. ""Regulation is bad"" is the kind of simplistic statement you expect from the Tories, where we all know what kind of regulation they really mean (workers rights).  So I restate my opinion that it's image that she's after. ""Look at me! I say stuff the Tories say!"". This isn't the result of a great thought about what's wrong with our country, it's picking up from the tabloid list of complaints about Labour and running with it.  ----at this point I spot the link below---  I've just read the full speech, and while it's not as bad as the article displays it, it's still pretty muddled. For example:   That was true even for the NHS. In 1948, Labour brought the patchwork of community and voluntary health provision under a national funding system, free at the point of use.    So, centralisation was good?   But hospitals continued to be rooted in their communities, with local representatives on the board.    Not sure this runs counter to a central strategy. Let's see what else she's got:   Our party was created to be the national voice for the workplace activists, community organisers and civic leaders who were fighting against poverty and injustice. It gave them a bigger platform, better funding, and the legal status to ensure what they created could make a bigger difference.   Ah, so again, centralisation was good and hey look! Regulation helped too!   It’s about how we are treated by the people around us, and the institutions and services we use. It’s about self-respect, dignity and a sense of control over our own lives. That feeling of control isn’t created by government alone. We won’t make Britain a more equal society if a small group of people in Whitehall have all the power and everyone else has none. Real control only comes when people can do things for themselves.   So, you do want government to influence how people act in their daily lives? Or you don't because it's not something in government's purview and therefore is irrelevant?   This morning, I visited Brixton Energy. Their strap-line is ‘power to, for and by the people’. Brixton Energy is a co-operative that generates cheap solar electricity and ploughs the profits back into the local area. Community energy doesn’t just generate electrical power. It creates people power: making sure residents have a stake and a say in an industry which all too often feels distant and out of control.   Hey! We could follow the model of the NHS and SureStart as you say! Why not take all these local power generation companies and help them join up nationally, maybe with a national brand and shared resources...oh wait.  ""By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone"" - now where have I read that before?"

Some of their arguments against are very cogent, and we should be having a debate on them.  (For what it's worth, this piece looks like it's mostly built on begging the question, and avoids dealing with both the polling that suggests there is a lot of support for more-left-than-Ed policies outside of the immigration/benefits section, and also the fact that most of the immigration and benefits issues are to do with perception rather than policy.)  But carpet-bombing the subreddit with 'don't vote Corbyn because X' isn't exactly helping--it's implying all the other leadership candidates are utterly spotless by comparison, and that the reasons why we'd prefer them over Jeremy are so utterly obvious that it's not even worth insulting the subreddit's intelligence by pointing them out.  We should be scrutinising all the candidates, surely?"
LabourUK,3dyayp,CaptainHayashi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:55 2015 UTC,"The media are giving him a lot of coverage, I think what gets posted here just reflects that. I've struggled to find any serious coverage of, for example, Yvette Cooper in the mainstream media."

LabourUK,3dyayp,Iainfletcher,5,Mon Jul 20 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"sigh  Can we stop posting articles that are nothing but conjecture and future predictions and perhaps start putting forward an alternative vision?  These constant attacks on Corbyn are at best ineffectual and at worst counter-productive. Rather than whinge the membership aren't voting your way, perhaps try and work out why.  The argument that we need to be more centre ground is not won, it's conjecture and conjecture that flies in the face of opinion polling. There's a reason we lost 5 million voters under Blair and it wasn't being too left wing. There's a reason that two thirds of voters feel there's no difference between the two main parties so what's the point, and it's not because we need to be closer to the Tories.  I'm not saying the opposite viewpoint is right and this is wrong, I'm saying it's all conjecture and unprovable. I could point to stats showing our support growing before Blair and dropping throughout his term until it rebounded when he left. It's not cut and dried.  What all leaders need to do is provide a vision for the future and a vision with hope. The reason Corbyn is doing well isn't because we're all hard left nutters, it's because he's not as bland and pointless as the others. Where's the optimism in Kendall's vision (what is Kendall's vision?)? Cooper comes the closest with vague statements about a high tech economy, but that's about it.  tl;dr - Leadership Contenders: stop blaming your complete lack of vision and charisma on Jeremy Corbyn and up your game."
LabourUK,3dxcs0,Patch86UK,6,Mon Jul 20 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"This is it. You get into power, then shape opinion (see: the minimum wage, among other evidence, that Blair did this successfully). It rarely works the other way around."
LabourUK,3dxcs0,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon Jul 20 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, I hope that nobody here is thinking that it will be easy to convince people, after five years of us not adequately challenging austerity, suddenly the consensus is wrong and we're going against everything that's been ingrained in the public consciousness and this is a good thing.  But that's not to say it isn't impossible, just very difficult (a bit like Labour winning in 2020 in general, then).  And what it'd take is some credible economic background for anti-austerity (which I believe exists, but haven't any citations with me), and a hell of a marketing coup (which we need anyway)."
LabourUK,3dxcs0,CaptainHayashi,4,Mon Jul 20 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Do you know the reason the public bought the Tory line on austerity? They weren't all empty vessels waiting to be filled with the first idea that came long. It's because they were already primed to buy it: Debt and the deficit were high; welfare and immigration spending were pissing people off; people felt that public sector workers were inefficient and overpaid, and some areas of the public sector that had received a lot of money were still underperforming on some measures.  The accuracy or otherwise of these sentiments is irrelevant: The point is that people were willing to buy austerity because it fit perfectly into so many aspects of public feeling that had been developing from long before the crash: Welfare's too high? We'll cut it. Public sector workers are overpaid? We'll freeze their pay. And so on.  If your message is, as Corbyn's has been so far: 'No. We don't want austerity', then you lose, because you're not tapping into anything apart from anti-austerity feeling. This is borne out by the post-election polling and focus groups run by the TUC and others: People knew we'd protect spending on health and education, they knew we'd look after the low paid, they, in essence, didn't think we'd be 'austerity-lite'. They just didn't think we could actually run the economy, or deal with immigration or welfare spending.  (Note to everyone: Please, for the love of all that is holy socialist, don't make me share 'The Mountain to Climb', again, by telling me about how we lost votes to the SNP and Greens because we were 'austerity-lite'.

The party has come to a position over the last week and we now have a Reasoned Amendment which sets out our opposition to the bill.  As you know, I was very clear last weekend that we could not simply abstain on this bill and that we needed to set out where we have agreement with reforms, but more importantly, where we strongly disagree.  For example, I have said that, as leader, I will oppose the two-child policy.   I also strongly oppose the changes in this bill that will increase child poverty whilst at the same time abolishing the child poverty reduction target.  I will always defend our record as a Labour government of supporting low-paid people in work, and into work, through our tax credits.   For these reasons, I have led calls for the party to change its position.   Our reasoned amendment sets out clearly our opposition to many aspects of the bill. In truth, it could be stronger but it declines to give the bill a second reading and, therefore, voting for it tonight is the right thing to do.   The Tories want to use this period to brand us in the way they did in 2010. We must not allow that to happen.    Collective responsibility is important and it is what I would expect as leader of our party. It is why I will be voting for our reasoned amendment and, if it is defeated, abstaining on the bill.   But I can reassure you that this is only the beginning of a major fight with the Tories. I am determined that we will fight this regressive bill line by line, word by word in committee.  If the government do not make the major changes during committee stage, then, as leader, I will oppose this bill at third reading.  (bold is emphasis)."

(Yeah, I watch The Good Wife. It's a great show. Alan Cummings is in it)  She is, in other words, insisting on the principle of charity while not herself holding to it.  The other problem with this is that she's ignoring the fact that we are having a leadership debate, not a debate about politics. If we were debating the merits of, e.g., unilateral nuclear disarmament in and of itself, then saying, 'The public don't like it' would be irrelevant.  But that's not what we're debating: We're debating who should lead the party, and if we think one particular leader will be bad at leading the party, and we agree on some definitions of bad (among which would probably be 'In my opinion, X is unelectable'), there's no reason we can't use them in the debate.  Furthermore, as I've pointed out before, the likelihood that the election of either Kendall or Corbyn might well cause large numbers of people, including, perhaps, members of the PLP, to leave the party, is a valid part of the discussion.

Quite.

Not even Corbyn supporters know that Corbyn is electable.  The whole point of this debate is that we're taking a risk with whichever candidate we support, because there's four and a bit years during which a whole lot of variables completely unrelated to whichever leader gets in can intervene.

Haven't read the whole thing yet. Key finding:   So as well as failing to win Tory voters in sufficient numbers, Labour also failed to win Labour voters in sufficient numbers. That is the real, alarming story from this election.   It seems, as we suspected, that we lost votes across the spectrum:   One third of that [loss of votes] was to the SNP in Scotland [...] Worryingly, another third went to the Tories, and the rest was split between UKIP and the Greens   In other words if we momentarily accept that the SNP are to our left, or at least succesfully painted themselves as such, we lost about the same amount of our vote to our left as we did to our right."

And those that think about it roughly once every 5 years and base their decisions on a multitude of things from what the leader looks/sounds like to what headline policies would benefit them personally.   It's this second lot who we lost. Milliband was never a good leader in the eyes of many and we had very few policies that appealed to people on the ground like raising the threshold and right to buy did for the Tories. Those we did have were muddled and hard to see immediate benefit.   If we're going to win this group back we need an offer that's easy to explain and gives immediate impact. I think we missed a trick by lowballing the Minumum Wage offer and avoiding a debate on Europe. Housing is a tough one outside of RtB because it's not in reality a quick fix.   I've gone off track,  but the point is its the second group we need to focus on and they don't really care if we are left or right wing, they want us to be popular."

LabourUK,3du5bk,CaptainHayashi,2,Sun Jul 19 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"Regarding trade unions - the only people who can rehabilitate them is them. Labour can't do it, because quite properly Lab doesn't control the inner workings of the unions.  The unions flatly refuse to bother with private sector workers any more. They should be signing people up on zero-hours contracts etc, and fighting their cause. But they don't. They are now 100% public sector workers - with the problem that the employers are the state - so it constantly looks like they are fighting with the taxpayer.  Also, doing things like inconveniencing people in a tube strike at the height of summer is not smart. Paris got so fed-up with it's strikes it invested in driverless trains. No drivers, no strikes - but also no jobs.  I don't know why unions don't do imaginative things like raising subs to buy shares in the companies of the places their people work at. Buy sufficient shares and you get a seat on the board, and you can change things from the top of the company...  On immigration, we had that hustings where this poor English guy said how isolated he was at work where everyone spoke Polish and he couldn't participate - and he got told off by Corbyn for being mean and wanting to ban languages, apparently his complaint was infringing their rights. His right to be able to be English, go to work in England and have a chat in English was non-existent. Nobody is addressing that some of the people who are guests here are acting in a mean and ill-mannered way to Brits.  On the economy - lots of people are better off in this recession because it's deflationary, which means that interest rates have fallen. If you've kept your job and your mortgage payments have dropped sharply due to interest rate cuts, you are better off. So only the fringes of society have had a bad time (they've lost jobs).  Whereas in the early 1990's recession, it was inflationary which meant interest rates and mortgage payments rose. That meant everyone hurt - people in work but with mortgages were feeling pain from higher mortgage payments and people on the fringes lost their jobs. It's easier to make a case for change of govt in that condition.  I suspect Lab will not get traction till interest rates normalise again, and we'll see if the public are really in a resilient place to withstand that. Basically people only hear your message on the economy if they themselves are in pain, and then they are actively looking for something new. At the moment not many people are in pain."
LabourUK,3du5bk,aenor,4,Sun Jul 19 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Some of it is changing the narrative, something Labour aren't particularly good at. Probably because every time they try the right if the party get their arse in their hands and go into self destruct mode.   None of the contenders are as bad as Milliband in terms of image to be fair. His voice, his look and his message were awful. I'd worry Kendall would get torn apart by interviewers, she's very naive. Corbyn would need to be seen a lot more than Milliband was or face a similar issue of the press creating his image for him. Cooper and Burnham come across as career politicians and I think that ship has sailed. I think most agree that our hope of a leader that was media friendly went with Jarvis not putting his hat in the ring.   The more interesting question is about reshaping the left wing message for the 21st century. Issues like civil liberties, ownership of data and decentralisation of services should be at the heart of it for me. Also cleaning up politics and making it more democratic.   UKIP won a lot of traction with things like right of recall and direct democracy. I think the new left is far less authoritarian than the old left, I'm not sure any of the candidates get this.   I'll get stick for this because of the messenger, but Russel Brand suggests devolving power but still wants state owned energy, infrastructure, health, education, etc. I think this is a fairly common view. People can understand running essential services for the common good, if as a party we refuse to consider this for ideological reasons we won't be relevant. Conversely people want less government intrusion and more decision making ability at a local level, especially around council services and planning.   We also need to grow up about Europe. It's not working for a lot of people and that needs to change. It's not about benefit claimants it's about freedom of movement of people. The tide has turned on this and an awful lot of people across the spectrum no longer see a benefit to allowing labour from cheaper countries in with no restrictions. This is a central EU policy so the party have to come to terms with the fact that a lot of the working class simply will not vote for the status quo. This was a massive tactical error in the last election. We came across as piously telling people they were wrong and shouldn't have a say. It's a tough one but we need a policy that shows we understand and want to change the issues with the EU."

For me he's everything wrong with Labour right now."
LabourUK,3dubb4,rappersdo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:34 2015 UTC,"Well my reply seems to have vanished so, take 2.  Why the fuck is him owning a villa a bad thing? What more could we want than convincing rich people that sharing their wealth is better than hoarding it and they should vote labour? As it is, it's actually his family's not his.   He also denied firmly that he was a member of that club and didn't have that locker, and I'll believe a labour MP over the daily mail any day.   The northern thing was a joke that failed. You can't dislike someone for failing to make a joke well. I'm pretty sure all of us have made a cringeworthy joke at some point that we wish we had never said.   The trash comment is fair game, but again, he's on a network of cool people trying to seem cool. We've all probably made ourselves look like twats when trying to appear cool. As it is, that was ten years ago. If you look at what he's doing today, he's evidentially a good constituency MP since he increased him majority a fair bit. Moreover, he is absolutely trying his hardest to stop the Tories getting in in 2020, even if you don't like how he's doing it."

It says something about someone that they'd join a 'social network for elites' in the first place.   The fact he cosied up to Ed while he was in power and ditched him at the first sign of defeat doesn't bode well, how long was it after the election he was sat next to Mandelson being interviewed?  He may be trying his hardest to get the Tories out, but that's the bare minimum you expect from a Labour MP, and not voting against the welfare bill is one thing, but to actively support it makes me ashamed to be a part of Labour in all honesty. It's hard being a member of a party I feel more and more distant to by the day."

I'm not saying his comment was okay, but it's nowhere near bad enough to merit writing the man off as a good labour leader.   I personally also would have liked him to oppose the bill, but he abstained like more than a hundred others, he didn't vote for it."

Just awful.   Cooper and Burnham were almost identical to every other hustings, down to the same soundbites (if I hear Burnhams story about football or his ""we did fix the roof"" speech again I'll lose it).

Whilst the Scottish referendum has taught us not to be complacent with polls, that view is not consistent with current polling.   For starters, regarding Greece, polling has British voters on the side of the Troika - and let's be honest our media has the public thoroughly convinced that Greece are just large scale benefit scroungers...  Polling on remaining in the EU is still pretty much on the yes side, though it's close enough that the campaign will make all the difference.

This is not the case and to tackle it as such will likely impact other groups - you cannot be everything to everyone.   This obsession with regaining lost votes is costing the party dearly and is providing candidates devoid of a sense of direction as they are relying on what the media tells them matters to make their policies. Populist leaders are pointless.  I dislike the approach that states Labour should be a government in waiting. It is a nice ideal on paper but it only makes things worse when you have the party attempting to preempt the Tories in the media, just to force their hand. Demanding apologies for things people don't really care about for example, on the off chance that they can generate some opposition.   I think Labour is going to struggle no matter what option they take ultimately as long as they are not taking a stand for their beliefs. They need a very credible Plan B that they are willing to stand up for that is different to what the Tories offer. I think most of Corbyn's supporters feel he is offering that."

At the same time, I've seen the excesses of New Labour (which, yes, did do some terrific things in government, but was nowhere near perfect), and I see Labour poised to do the same things again, to sacrifice its goal and reason for existing to win big at the election.  And I just don't feel I can let that happen.  That's why I'm voting Jeremy Corbyn, because he convinces me the most that he's in this to change lives or die trying, and not just power-at-any-cost.  He isn't perfect either IMO (homeopathy, Argentina, party-splitting, etc.), but he ticks more of the boxes for me than do any of the other three candidates (with Yvette as my second pref ATM).  The Greens don't have the traction Labour does, approach their politics from what I think is a noble but effectively less relevant trajectory, and they tend to be somewhat... strange on certain policies.  EDIT: Oh, and there's the case of family tradition (even though this doesn't really count for much these days).  My parents are Labour, my grandparents on my dad's side were Labour, my grandpa was a union man and though I'm not sure how much he invested into the party I still got a 'oh, you're X's grandson, aren't you?' when I joined in 2010.  I went through a horribly immature phase of being Lib Dem (first legitimately, as an anti-Blair reaction I suppose, then only tactically) for about 5 years, then snapped at 2010 and joined Labour."
LabourUK,3dtnnf,CaptainHayashi,3,Sun Jul 19 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"Although I am now edging toward Yvette, the reason is that despite the narrative given to us, the Labour party isn't run as some kind of dictatorship. Him being the leader won't instantly turn Labour into some idealist left party. He is still required to listen to his cabinet and advisors, and its 2020 manifesto will be the result of a long negotiation process with party members.  I don't support the Greens because they are too green sky thinking. They have a lot of visions about what Britain should be, and I agree with that long-term vision. However, as the most exposure to how government works is through their one elected MP and several counsellors and devolved assembly/parliament members, they haven't got a credible plan as to what they need to do in order to achieve that goal. Their 2015 manifesto was a nice idea, but didn't contain anything solid enough to make you think ""This is a credible plan"".  Labour, on the other hand, is one of the three established parties. They've run the country several times, and have a lot of experience as to the harsh realities of government. A Corbyn-led Labour wouldn't be ""Corbyn's grand socialist experiment"", it would be Corbyn's vision tempered towards the centre by the sensibilities and experience of Labour.  And it's not like Corbyn is like the Greens himself. His vision is already fairly tempered by experience. He takes on active diplomatic roles and knows what he is doing. His views are already tempered by a high-degree of pragmatism.  EDIT: To give an example of how this might work. I don't think Corbyn's unilateral nuclear disarmament would make it into the 2020 manifesto. What is more likely is to promise to launch an extensive diplomatic mission to encourage multilateral disarmament across the globe, with an inquiry into more cost-effective defence strategies in the UK in the meantime.  EDIT2: To give an example of how Corbyn is more pragmatic than the Greens. The Greens proposal for education was just scrap tuition fees, and cancel student debt, and raise education funding, without any statement on how on earth they could possibly fund this. Meanwhile, one of Corbyn's plan (the other is essentially increase national insurance contributions by 7% and raising the tax threshold for high-income earner) is ""Income tax receipts are due to increase by £15 billion between 2019/20 and 2020/21. We should use two-thirds of that to reduce student debt - by scrapping fees and restoring grants - and use the remaining one-third to reduce the national debt"". Whether or not you agree with Corbyn's plan, his plan at least acknowledges that the money has to come from somewhere. That's the difference between the Greens and the Labour left, the Greens like to pretend money simply doesn't exist and thus throw free things everywhere, meanwhile the Labour left recognises that you need to have money in order to redistribute it."

If there's going to be a government on the left of the political spectrum it's going to be either Labour or dominated by Labour. It's all well and good running off to the Greens but I'd like to be in a party that's actually got a chance of doing something and implementing a progressive set of policies in government. Not just standing on the sidelines shouting about inequality and injustice, but actually trying to do something about it.  In my view Labour is - or should be - a left wing movement with genuine and realistic aspirations to govern progressively, and it should, I think, be a home to people of varying degrees of 'left'. Anyone from soft centre leftists to out and out socialists. Ultimately I feel that this means there is as much of a place for me in Labour as there is for someone like Liz Kendall."

If the election showed anything its that the parliamentary party isn't reaching Labour members let alone the wider electorate - Harman's benefits statement and Chuka's response to Corbyn show that.  I'm actually wondering if a party split might be on the cards. Even if it is I'll still support Corbyn.

If you like neither a huge state nor unrestrained capitalism, and you think our society could be operating in a much more sustainable and fundamentally ethical way then it's an interesting read.

See every major monopoly or the NHS Vs the rest of the world for examples.   Things that are expected to be the same across the country like health, utilities, education and policing are far more efficient as a government run monopoly than as a bunch of smaller initiatives replicating each others work."
LabourUK,3dqu07,Iainfletcher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree on some areas, but I also think those same 'monopolies' often benefit from significant devolution. I mean take mental health within the NHS for instance: one of the main problems it's facing right now is that it's so centralised that local services and departments find it very difficult to give the level of care that patients need. So I guess a sort of 'decentralised monopoly' is what I might advocate.  You mention education is best run by the government, but I think that depends what you mean by 'the government.' I honestly have no problem with private schools personally, and I see no problem with people choosing to send their children there and letting those schools have a degree of autonomy - but I think state schools are best run by local government. So government, yes, but local, responsible to a board partially composed of residents (parents), teachers, and government representatives would be ideal.  In the same sense that I think boards of directors in companies should have representation by individuals nominated democratically by the workers, the point of both of these measures would be to balance competing interests in the interests of compromise and representation of varying, competing interests. This is a system employed with great success in Germany and across Scandinavia.  Does that sort of answer your question more broadly?"

Personally I don't see immigration as a right wing issue I see it as a working class issue, but I know I'm in the minority in the party. Those voters for whom it is a key issue will probably be the ones voting Tory for a referendum and that issue isn't on the table next election. However, the way we campaign in the referendum will impact our perception just like it did in Scotland. I'm not sure the party understands this and thinks that simply having their own campaign will be enough.

I have relatives and friends who vote UKIP, and they're not ideologically right-wing. I think they're pretty representative of a lot of UKIP voters in that they're essentially disaffected white working class who see immigration negatively and believe the EU is harmful.  I share their Euroscepticism - we've become a party which just seems to blindly sing the praises of the EU regardless of how much that means prostrating ourselves to its neoliberal economic agenda.

So Obama's govt can raise federal tax knowing that all US citizens must pay it even if they live in Monaco.  Now Osborne has tried to copy Miliband's policy and close down non-dom - but you will still be able to cherry-pick tax regimes within the UK thanks to devolution.  I'm pretty sure the SNP will cut top tax to lure people to Scotland. And England will then cut the top tax to ensure people arn't cherry-picking and that it's the same across the isle.

Then to make the figures work, the SNP centralised policing (which is paid for out of council tax) and slashed numbers, closed four emergency control centres and so on. The result? Some poor woman sat at the side of the road for three days, in acute pain slowly dying because no-one came to help.

Then distressed Labour canvasser comes to the door. Why didn't you vote? ""You are all the same"". Puts big guilt trip on the Labour canvasser, and then goes back to plonk themselves back on sofa, having post-justified the fact that they didn't go to the polling booth on the Labour party.   But nothing you offer them will make them vote. Screaming Lord Sutch (from the Monster Loonies) was remarking all the way back in the 1960's that Labour voters just refused to turn out.   P.S.

They did it by predicting incredible oil prices so everyone would be Rich, Rich!  Salmond said that the oil price of $116 used in the SNP's white paper was ""conservative"" and it could go to three times as much. So his supporters were thinking, oil of $300 a barrel! We'll never have to work again!  In reality, oil had been over $100 for only five years in it's entire history, at teh time of the referendum it was $93, and people like the Norwegian central bank were predicting a fall.  In other words, the SNP were using Nigerian get-rich-quick tactics to persuade voters to vote for their own destitution and when Labour called them out on that we got accused of scaremongering.  The oil price is now below $50, and if Scotland had become independent they would have been suffering super-austerity-max. And Salmond would have said, ""tough, no revote, suckers"".  I suppose there are some people who look at the SNP's success and think, why don't we lie like that. Who cares if we're selling a scam, scamming works.  But parties who lie like that come undone - it will happen to the SNP too. It's not an example to copy.  At the moment their voters are rationalising the oil thing based on ""they didn't know"" (even though Salmond was an oil economist) and ""it's only a bonus"".  When they get sufficient distance from the referendum so they don't feel personally shamed for believing in the fibs, they'll admit they were had. It'll probably take about five years though.

They were promising more or less the exact same levels of spending/austerity as Labour were in the 2015 manifestos.

They promised rail nationalisation through franchise expiry- that was in the Labour manifesto too. I can't think of any other headlines (my bias, due to what interests me)- can you give any solid examples of where the two parties really diverged in a Left/Right way?  I think it's foolish to pretend the ""Broken Westminster politics"", ""We're different"", ""A Scottish Party for Scotland"" rhetoric didn't make an impact. It's a good sell. That's certainly a sort of (light, benign, civic) nationalism- the idea that the SNP are inherently better because they're focused entirely on Scotland, rather than those UK-wide parties who are focusing on ""people who aren't you""."

LabourUK,3doaxo,gamas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"Liz opposed the cuts to working tax credits and has set up a review to look into where we find the money to pay for them.  She has, however, supported the cut to child tax credits beyond 2 children."
LabourUK,3doaxo,redowl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry yes, I've only recently caught up with the hustings - I think this is the problem with the fact that people are using ""tax credits"" without the qualifier when discussing the stances of the candidates...  Honestly, I think no part of Liz Kendall is Tory, and I thought it was incredibly harsh when Victoria read out that email (as that Corbyn supporter said ""Victoria, you have a lot of faith in what people say...""). I do think though that what she is wrong about is the idea that we should accept the public narrative rather than challenge it. Like the YouGov poll said 67% support the cut in child tax credit - but is that because they don't think people just entirely think people with more than two children shouldn't get benefits, or is it because no-one has been strong enough in making people realise the kind of families that are affected?"
LabourUK,3doaxo,gamas,2,Sat Jul 18 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"I can see where people get the impression that Liz is a ""red tory"" as people keep saying, but you don't have to look far too see that she belongs in Labour.  I think the biggest problem is that she clearly lacks experience, this becomes clear in several interviews where it takes the interview a few tries to get the answer out of her.  She comes across a little better in the hustings for the most part, and we see glimpses of a great leader and a great prime minister.  Policy wise, I agree with most of what she says (minus backing the two child tax credit thing) and she has what it takes to make Labour electable again, but for the most part, she needs to answer the damn questions in interviews."

His ideological prescriptions are better suited to one of the rump Marxist outfits of the faculty lounge left. Contrary to the myth-making of his acolytes, Corbyn does not represent the ""Old Labour Party"" before it was corrupted by Blair and all that unseemly election-winning business. He belongs to a fringe always present in the labour movement and rejected by every successful Labour leader in a century.   You can't get annoyed at people saying that some candidates on one side of the spectrum shouldn't be in the party, then applaud as other people say the candidate on the other side of the spectrum shouldn't be in the party...  I agree with you that the people accusing Liz of being ""basically Tory"" need to shut the fuck up and treat her with respect and civility, but it's a two-way street.. This leadership contest is supposed to be a time of introspection into the party's values, it's not the time for us to go slinging shit at each other.  This article is about as disrespectful as all the crap that those on the far-left of the party are saying.  EDIT: I'm currently catching up on the hustings, and I think we should take note of how the candidates themselves behave. Liz and Jeremy were sat next to each-other in Stevenage, and they had clear respect for each other, even if they didn't agree. Liz would nod along and agree to things Jeremy said and vice versa, they would laugh at each other's jokes, and generally acted as comrades. Yet then you come here or talk to other MPs and its ""Oh my god why doesn't Liz just fuck off to the Tories"" or ""Corbyn is such a fucking dinosaur, why doesn't his Stalinist arse just fuck off to the 1940s"". This isn't how we should behave towards each other within the party, and it's the people promoting hostility in the party who should leave."

Labour has no reputation in the public eye. Labour are fully the ""Labour - I suppose party"" where I live, there's no better option so people vote Labour. I'm glad Burnham's strategy is falling apart on him, it's unfair that because he's shifted from the right of the party to take up a more centist stance(whilst pandering to the left a bit) that he doesn't face the same criticism Chuka Umunna did.   Burnham seems to think because he has a northern accent it's his god-given right to lead the party. I've seen him say ""We should have that debate"" on many issues like immigration and then fail to debate it, at a hustings no less.  They both did the same thing, just Burnham wasn't as quick and was more calculated. I think the Blairites need to take the moral highground if they really believe they are correct, having Hunt and Umunna come out and criticise the inclusion of Corbyn is only going to further drive support his way."

She's clearly gone beyond just being ""the girl who started a political fandom"", as she is actually taking the time to sit down with all the candidates and get a proper insight into what they believe them, rather than just playing to a ""fandom"".  We all joined the Labour party for different reasons, and we should applaud any who are inspired to get involved in politics, and get to grips with what they believe in, regardless of how they started that journey."
LabourUK,3dmbj6,JohnJoBiggins,5,Fri Jul 17 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"Where to begin?  She says that many of Corbyn's policies have wide public support, but the only example she can give is renationalising the railways, which, even if it's a good idea, we literally cannot afford to do.   And she also ignores the fact that simply proposing a list of policies that people support in the abstract is not actually an effective path to victory. Perceptions of parties shape perceptions of policies, and vice versa. The best research on this centres around the Tory campaign in 2005, wherein the Tories said quite a lot of stuff that voters agreed with in the abstract, but which voters rejected when they were presented to them by the ""nasty"" Tory party.  Likewise with Labour, if we present a costly, stereotypically left-wing policy to the electorate, even if voters agree with it in the abstract they will see it through the lens of Labour's alleged profligacy and Corbyn's far-left origins, and likely reject it.  Moving on from that line, she seems to think that Trident is massively unpopular, which is the exact opposite of the truth.  Then she goes on to criticise centrist/""Blairite"" figures like Chuka for telling the party to 'take its medicine' - i.e. to do things that are unpalatable in order to win power. This is an incredibly stupid analogy, because when someone's telling you to take your medicine you should probably do it if you want to get better. What's the alternative? Sweat out your fever? Maybe Corbyn would rather we use homoeopathy...  She acknowledges that the purported centre ground has moved to the right over the past five years, but doesn't actually deal with this reality. She seems to want to shift the centre ground back leftwards, even further to the left than it was before.  She ignores the reality that the Tories were able to shift the centre ground to the right mainly because they were in power for five years, and had the right-wing press parroting their every line.   Likewise, when we were in power we were able to shift the public discourse leftwards. Yes, even under Tony Blair. The minimum wage, SureStart, paternity pay, equal rights, devolution, etc. etc. are all now part of the accepted status quo. We were only able to achieve that remarkable shift in public opinion because we had access to the levers of power.  So if we ever want to be able to shift the discourse leftwards again, we need to be in government.   She says ""the centre is an ever-shifting territory that is captured by the person with the strongest rhetoric,"" as if strong rhetoric is all that is needed. What is needed is power. We have known this to be true since the Fabians were founded 134 years ago.  She says that ""the Labour Party wins when they articulate a message of hope"". So, now she's completely abandoned talking about winning policies (which Corbyn doesn't appear to have) and has moved on to talking about hopeful rhetoric.  Sure, hope is important, but it isn't enough. Ed Miliband's core message for the general election was the hopeful, ""Britain can be Better"". Articulating hope is not enough: you need to prove to the electorate that their hopes - dare I say their aspirations? - can actually be achieved without wrecking what they already have. A bird in hand, etc.  She says that the one thing that made Blair an electoral success was the fact that he was ""incredibly hopeful"", as if his centrist policies (which she apparently despises) had nothing to do with it. Blair was successful specifically because he acknowledged that the centre ground had shifted over the 10+ years of Tory rule, and he moved Labour on to it. She is trying to appropriate the mantle of Blairism for Corbyn while rejecting its core lesson.  And then she finishes by talking about Syriza while totally eliding the fact that Tsipras's far-left rhetoric and flamboyant posturing has left the average working-class Greek person in dire straits and cost the left its legitimacy in the minds of the Greek people.  Oh, and she completely elides the initial question: whether Corbyn is actually electable. I take it from her non-answer that she doesn't think he is."

LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,4,Fri Jul 17 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"Although Corbyn has fallen out of my favour as I don't think someone who so brazenly dismisses evidence and refuses compromise for their personal beliefs is someone who is leadership material, I do think both sides, in this party and this subreddit need to calm down.  To the pro-Corbyn side: no Corbyn isn't the saviour of the party, he is no Clement Attlee. Whilst he has genuine and passionate socialist views which represent the roots of the party, his inability to compromise will ultimately be his downfall.   As we saw with Syriza, being able to compromise and know when to fold is an important quality if you want to be able to get even half of what you want. Syriza refused to compromise at every turn, and this ultimately meant that instead of getting a reasonable deal that would supported their goals whilst also giving something to their creditors, they are stuck with a deal that is even worse than what the creditors were originally proposing. Early on their creditors were willing to meet them half-way, but Syriza's refuse to meet them half-way in return cost them everything.  To the anti-Corbyn side: no Corbyn being elected as Labour leader will not mean fire and brimstone will rain down from the sky and burn all roses to extinction, with Cameron's face looming in the blue sky afterwards. No, he is not Michael Foot - as Corbyn actually isn't a frail man with no charisma, and even if he was, Foot's selection wasn't what broke the 1983 election. Polls at the time actually had Labour polling highly even after the SDP split. In fact, Labour's support briefly surged after his selection, only dropping after the SDP split (with the drop consistent with the rise of support for the Liberal-SDP alliance)  In fact, for several months the Liberal-SDP alliance and Labour were the two most popular parties, with the Tories only having the third highest support. Had the Falklands War never happened, we would have been living in a bizarro world where the Tories and Lib Dems swapped places.  tl;dr If the party self-destructs as a result of Corbyn's election, it will only be because we got so caught up in hysteria that we all descended in petty infighting that splits the party in two. There are three other candidates who also need to be scrutinised, and focussing all our time on whether or not Corbyn will be a disaster is not productive."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Fri Jul 17 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"You can't boil history down to something as simple as 'No Falklands = Thatcher loses the 1983 election'. The general public voted Tory for the two elections after that, after all, so you can't put the whole thing down to temporary and one-off factors like the Falklands War.  As to the polling: All Oppositions experience bounces in the polls. Labour's polling rose and fell dramatically during the last Parliament even without any 'obvious' factors like the Falklands to explain it."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,3,Fri Jul 17 13:04:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, but I think the fact is that Labour still managed to poll highly in that period even with Michael Foot at the helm (and if not for the SDP splinter, the polling would seem relatively unphased). This means it's also not possible to boil history down to 'Left-wing policy = Labour loses the 1983 election'. It would also be disingenuous to blame Foot's policies for the 87 and 92 elections, given Kinnock ran on a more centre ground.  I mean don't get me wrong, I don't think Corbyn could possibly sway public opinion enough to put Labour in a position where they could win an election. But I also don't think his election would be as apocalyptic for the party as people claim. It's definitely not worth the ""DAE think if Corbyn is elected then even UKIP or the Lib Dems have a better chance at winning"" circlejerk present on this subreddit... Worst case scenario I reckon is that we'd win quarter of the Scottish seats back at the cost of a number of English seats and ultimately be exactly where we are now...."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,AnxiousMo-Fo,0,Fri Jul 17 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"Well, Corbyn's election would cause some pretty serious problems outside his unelectability (about which I'm glad to see you agree) because of his plans for changing the internal democracy of the party. I'm not necessarily saying we should give up hope but rather that there is a serious risk of splitting the party and/or making it unelectable well beyond his leadership, however long that may last.  Leaders' impact on their parties outlast their leadership for at least two reasons. Firstly, public perception takes a while to shift and secondly the people they promote to the top tend to stick around for a while. For example, while Kinnock moved away from Foot's positions, he was dogged by a) the memory of the far-left manifesto and b) his close association with Foot and the left of the party, and the continued prominence of much of the left in positions of power.  As to Kinnock's losses, if you go just one election further, you'll notice that Blair went even further to the centre and won spectacularly. There's a pretty clear trend of moving to the centre and then winning, which includes at least the 2010 election for the Tories. Even the 2015 win was arguably a result of their demonstrating they could lead a centre-right coalition and their legacy of some progressive reforms, most notably gay marriage."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,2,Fri Jul 17 14:09:20 2015 UTC,"because of his plans for changing the internal democracy of the party.   I mean I agree with you to an extent here as well, I have issues with his commitment to democracy. I don't know I can trust that someone who launched a scathing attack on someone for supporting proportional representation, whilst supporting FPTP really has a good handle on what fair, democratic process is...  In terms of legacy, I don't think Corbyn is any worse than any of the other candidates in this respect. Both Yvette and Andy have blood on their hands over the Iraq war and people still remember that (Kendall I will admit has done a pretty good job at avoiding any scrutiny of what her position on the Iraq war was, and, of course, is innocent by default of not being elected until 2010).   Kendall, whilst I am stepping back from calling her Blue Labour because in the past couple of weeks she has shown she does have Labour principles, I still think her level of capitulation to what the Tories support goes over the mark where it ceases to be a platform that can convince people it's worth changing the current government for. The cutting of working tax credits are currently one of the few measures in the announced budgets that polls have demonstrated the people aren't really getting behind. If there is just one measure she should oppose in the budget, it should be this. If she is not going to take a stance over the measures that are unpopular even amongst Tory voters, then people aren't going to see the point of switching to Labour...  I think, in general, both sides overexaggerate the impact that Corbyn would have on the party, and we should just treat him as any other candidate. Ideally, I would have preferred a ""Nicola Sturgeon""-like figure to be running in this leadership election - the widespread public praise over Mhairi Black's maiden speech from both sides of the political spectrum show the kind of leader people want from a party like ours."

Someone needs to explain to me how this means Corbyn has a chance (unless of course the economy tanks but I still wouldn't wish that on the country)"
LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,3,Fri Jul 17 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"The argument is that the task of a political party isn't to concede to the public view but to define it.  The one thing the Tories are good at which Labour are fairly rubbish (with the exception of Blair) at, is controlling the public narrative. Even when their policies are causing the economy to tank, they are able to convince people that they are the best option for the stability of the nation.   We've seen that with the recent budget announcement. Throughout the election campaign, they said that Labour's campaign for a higher minimum wage, to end non-dom status and control rents would absolutely wreck the economy. Yet they were able to work these ideas into the budget and receive universal praise for it.  It's this power of using doublespeak to convince people your ideological views  will only benefit them, convincing people you will protect hard-working families whilst slashing their budgets. The announcement of the new national living wage made people completely forget that this is entirely counteracted by the complete slashing of working tax credits.  Being able to convince people that they should accept government surveillance. They are dangerously competent at adopting their narrative.  Now for all you can possibly say about Thatcher, she was absolutely brilliant at this, so brilliant in fact that she practically destroyed the left-wing movement for at least a generation.  In theory, a left-wing Labour wing labour could bring the people around, if only their leader was as brilliant at spinning the narrative as Thatcher was. Scotland has shown this is possible, Nicola Sturgeon managed to unite both the left and right under a pro-nationalist, left-wing, anti-austerity banner. And for all his flaws, despite not being Tory, Farage was able to sway the public narrative towards an anti-immigration, anti-EU platform. Sadly I don't think any of the leader candidates for Labour are capable of spinning the public narrative in their direction.   To win an election, you need to be able to convince people that your way is the right way. This doesn't require you to conform to the leading narrative, it requires you to absolutely sell your narrative at all points whilst completely demolishing all opposing narratives - not just in the run-up in the election but in the entire parliamentary term. This is where Labour has failed, and where it will continue to fail unless either the Tories falter so hard that no amount of spin can allow them to recover, or (the safer bet) Labour elects a leader whose narrative voice is so strong they blast away the Tories.   EDIT tl;dr It doesn't matter what platform you stand on, all that matters is that you are able to convince people that it is the only platform worth listening to.  EDIT2: Uncharacteristically (for me), I'm actually going to quote Liz Kendall on this:   We could have stopped the suffering that Thatcher imposed on communities across Britain had we been a credible alternative rather than simply a party of protest.  Labour's fundamental mistake back then meant we were powerless to stop the Conservatives decimating families and tearing our communities apart.   Whilst she doesn't mean it the way I am presenting it, her words are correct - regardless of whether we run a left-wing, right-wing or centrist platform, the only way you can stop the Tory spin machine is to throw a spanner in to break the cogs and then replace it with your own spin machine. Standing on the sidelines and just idly moaning that the Tory spin machine is wrong isn't going to cut it. The Tories have a majority of just 12, and already there are signs of discontent on their backbenches, breaking the Tory machine shouldn't be that hard if we poke at it enough. Then it's just a case of running a better spin machine before the Tories can fix theirs..."

And the 1945 election was unusual - it was the khaki election, the only one we've ever had when half the electorate were in uniform.  That had all sorts of effects - the voting took place abroad, in barracks for the soldiers. The conscripts were sick to the back teeth of war, they'd been grimly at it for four years, killing, seeing friends being killed, not knowing for most of it if we'd even win. The ones in the far east were actually still fighting, would see their colleagues blown up beside them, and then trek back to barracks to cast their vote. They'd taken so many risks by that point they were numb and it seemed they had nothing to lose by rolling the dice and taking one more risk on radical politics.  Another side effect of half the voters being abroad was that they weren't consuming any of the stuff from the press. The Express were calling Attlee something out of the gestapo but our lads deployed in the jungles of Burma didn't see a newspaper for years.  There was a reason that Attlee wanted the election so soon after D-day (it was held within three months) and Churchill wanted to wait till everyone was de-mobbed.  When everyone was demobbed, normal politics ensued and Labour lost the 1951 election and was then out of power for 13 years.  Back to the future politics don't work because we cannot recreate the conditions of the past. This ought to be obvious but it clearly isn't. So I'll say it again we cannot recreate the conditions of the past. And when those conditions applied to a point in time seventy years ago in world war conditions - you've gone batshit crazy, love.

It's the one disadvantage of our broad-church system.  But we're all in this for the same reason, I like to think, so the correct response is to stick together, give the winner of the election a combination of support and critique (whoever wanted Echo Chamber Labour?), and if you really think the leader's had it then there's always the next leadership election to prepare for.   Blair won 3 elections. Red Ed moved left, moving FUTHER in the wrong direction won't work   'Red Ed' was only a fraction towards the left of Blair.  His problem was more that he didn't give a convincing account of what he stood for and how he'd make the country a better place.  Admittedly he did much better in the closing days of the election and came out as IMO a beacon of relative honesty and conviction, but by then Labour was doomed to lose simply because nobody knew what it stood for.  Maybe you're right.  Maybe we are moving in the wrong direction.  But polling suggests that a lot of left-wing policies are favoured by the electorate, so I don't think it's as simple as loss by ideology.  Thatcher won 3 elections too.

LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:21:42 2015 UTC,"Well history notes that Labour were actually doing okay until the Falklands War (well apart from the SDP split which led to the rise of the Liberal-SDP alliance). The Conservatives were rather disliked at the time, it was only their decisiveness in the Falklands War that caused them to surge in popularity. Until the Falklands War we consistently polled higher than Thatcher's Conservatives.  EDIT: If I'm honest, Michael Foot's biggest flaw wasn't that he was left-wing I think that barely had any impact. His flaw was that he terribly mediocre as a politician and lacked the strength and assertiveness to keep the party together. The media didn't really attack him on his policies, they attacked on the fact that he was completely toothless in the face of internal pressure."

LabourUK,3dlg0u,matthewfelgate,-2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:37 2015 UTC,Yes because it's what the electorate JUST FUCKING VOTED FOR.
LabourUK,3dlg0u,Kingy_who,7,Fri Jul 17 08:01:42 2015 UTC,That's what 22% of the electorate voted for.

LabourUK,3dlg0u,matthewfelgate,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:03 2015 UTC,Do you actually accept we lost the election because WE WERE WRONG?
LabourUK,3dlg0u,CaptainHayashi,2,Fri Jul 17 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, we were wrong.  We were wrong to regulate the banks, meaning that the financial crisis caught us with our trousers down.  We were wrong to allow the Tories to write the book on the economy.  We were wrong to stay silent and then not make our minds up whether to challenge the narrative or apologise til we were blue in the face.  We were wrong to do the latter all the way up to Question Time then suddenly U-turn and insist we were right all along.  We were wrong to come up with incredibly vague 'policies' then inscribe them on an 8ft plinth as a publicity stunt.  We were wrong to visit Russell Brand weeks after close of registration.  We were wrong to offer the voters nothing for four years and then everything in the last one.  We were wrong to let our pitch become 'vote Labour, win a microwave' (with apologies to whomever came up with that brilliant summary).  We were wrong to count the number of conversations we were having with voters, and not the substance of them.  We were wrong to join Better Together on the Tories' terms, alienating swathes of Scottish voters even if we won the referendum.  We were wrong to tell the electorate they couldn't be trusted with an EU referendum.  We were wrong to walk into a trap of nationalism on one side and nationalism on the other.  We were wrong to treat Labour like something that pops up at election then disappears for four years out of five.  We were wrong to take our core voters for granted.  We were wrong to assume they wouldn't become disillusioned with mainline politics.  Note that none of these things have much to do with being too left-wing, or our choice in leader.  We were wrong on marketing, wrong on how we approached the electorate, and wrong on nationalism."

LabourUK,3dlg0u,gamas,2,Fri Jul 17 15:10:52 2015 UTC,"As much as I get your sentiment, I think its disingenuous to claim the electorate voted for this budget. Not only does this budget contradict a lot of manifesto pledges, the Tory manifesto never really said anything about welfare other than £12bn of cuts. Whether the public would have still agreed with the Tories if their manifesto had been a 100% accurate proposal of what they were going to do is unclear. I mean its kinda hard to ignore that at least two of the points in Labour's manifesto that the Tories claimed were ""absolutely going to destroy the economy"", ended up in their own fucking budget...  The Tories said not solving the deficit at the pace they were before the election was going to wreck the economy, and yet the budget now puts targets that are at the same speed as what Miliband was proposing. It's so fucking moronic.  This is kinda why I've always been in favour of some kind of regulation and independent regulatory body to prevent this kind of ""bait-and-switch"" style politics....  EDIT: And regarding the specific measure of cutting working tax credit: This YouGov Poll (and just to pre-empt it, no the fact that polls failed one time to predict the seat allocation in one particularly complicated election does not mean every poll ever conducted should be dismissed) conducted after the reveal of the budget revealed that only 12% of the electorate believe too much is spent on people with low wages on benefits, with 45% believing too little is spent.. So on this specific issue, Labour wouldn't be going against the electorate by opposing it..."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,rappersdo,4,Fri Jul 17 10:59:26 2015 UTC,No it fucking isn't.  The fact people are perpetuating this myth that the Tories can do stuff they have no mandate for simply because they won is fucking moronic and the kind of defeatism that would see us stand on yet another moderate platform that lost us the last 2 elections.
LabourUK,3dlg0u,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Fri Jul 17 08:07:18 2015 UTC,"Tories can do stuff they have no mandate for simply because they won   We have a representative parliamentary democracy. Being able to command a Commons majority gives you a mandate. That is the system.  As to the rest of your point, I'm going to yet again present the sub with 'The Mountain to Climb', the Fabian Society report saying the only way to win is to win votes from the Tories. If you can refute that report or explain how Corbyn can win votes from the Conservatives, please do."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,matthewfelgate,0,Fri Jul 17 10:05:15 2015 UTC,Well they can do what they want because they have a majority.
LabourUK,3dlg0u,rappersdo,2,Fri Jul 17 08:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yes but that doesn't mean we shouldn't oppose them, you know the whole point of what an opposition is supposed to do."

LabourUK,3dlg0u,rappersdo,3,Fri Jul 17 09:38:07 2015 UTC,"Please enlighten me, since you're clearly the authority on everything. Opposition can abstain yes, but on an issue like social security?   On cuts that will leave many families up and down the country worse off? Just to score some political points? That's not what we're supposed to be about. But please, keep being as condescending as you are being, it's really refreshing to see someone so open about defending the Tories."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:44:03 2015 UTC,"He isn't defending the Tories, nor, actually is he being condescending, although he isn't arguing particularly well (sorry, Matt).  The fact is, though, that the Tories have a majority. Labour could vote against the cuts, for the cuts, or abstain, and it would make no difference to the Tory's ability to implement the cuts.  Therefore, the only thing we can do is try and behave in a way that makes us more likely to win elections. /u/matthewfelgate may well be wrong that voting against the cuts is the correct way to do that, but he is not wrong that the role of the Opposition is to do more than simply vote or argue against every single thing the Government does."
LabourUK,3dlg0u,matthewfelgate,2,Fri Jul 17 10:08:46 2015 UTC,Well you seem to be talking about two separate issues: The nature of opposition and opposition to tax credits. On the nature of opposition: Out of government gives our party a fantastic opportunity to refresh our vision for the country and formulate a series of policies in reflection. We should do that in the light of out values and beliefs; Where these policies happen align with the government we should champion and support them; Where we disagree we should being the leading voice of disconsent in the country. If we define ourselves as simply being opposite of everything the government does it by its very definition ostracises us from the prospect of governance for eternity. Only by setting our own political agenda can we seek the mandate of the people to govern at the next election.
LabourUK,3dlg0u,AnxiousMo-Fo,0,Fri Jul 17 10:18:23 2015 UTC,"No, we have an interim leader, so it's impossible to be a credible Opposition.  But yes, we could be a credible Opposition and back those things."
LabourUK,3dkz7j,Bialoveld,6,Fri Jul 17 02:57:44 2015 UTC,Agreement:    Labour don't stand in seats of standing Libdem MPs or Libdem target seats.  Libdems don't stand against Labour MPs or Labours target seats.

The Tories ran a bigger deficit. Teachers and nurses didn't cause Wall St to crash. etc. etc.  The economic argument has to be about growth and productivity. Two things this government is weak on. GDP per capita has flatlined. The return of hand car washes shows how we're going backwards in productivity. The government are relying on low wages which is killing productivity. They are cutting corporation tax but not seeing companies relocate actual business in return, point this out. They have missed every deficit reduction target they have set, point this out. They are on track to miss their exports target, point this out. If we can get over our squeamishness about talking about the downsides of immigration, point out how the government have made it better for companies to hire foreign grads than train our own.  We don't even have to win the borrowing argument, just be ready to refute it with real life examples, like how most people have a huge debt/income ratio thanks to buying a house. People understand making wise investments over poor ones and borrowing to invest.  Basically, make the argument that Labour does what's best for the country based on evidence from the past and around the world, whereas the Tories are ideological and bad for the economy. The facts back this up, so it should be a damn sight easier to make this argument."

Essentially new labour but not unquestioningly pro-european like the Blairites, more interested in blue-collar issues and the safety net.  I also think she's more intelligent than Burnham. Final plus point: she's a mother (I keep getting stick for saying motherhood is special and not something to be denigrated just because a lot of the planet does it - but it's life-threatening, scary, demanding and a whole bunch of other things that I will expand on in another post)."

LabourUK,3dhsjs,TrickyDickNixonbot,5,Thu Jul 16 16:21:52 2015 UTC,He's not going to win because of the exaggeration of one poll(which are always right aren't they).

Confirms my worst fears about Corbyn, a 5 minute Google shows he's also:   Against nuclear power Anti-GMO   And thus represents the worst of the anti-science faction of the left. I'll still put a vote in for him in second place because he's closer to where we need to be in a whole host of areas, but I couldn't vote for a man with such poor judgement and lack of respect for evidence for leader with a clear conscience."

LabourUK,3dikfa,aenor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"From the article:   Look around the top of politics and it seems like a wonderful time to be a woman. Two of the four candidates for the Labour leadership are female – Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall – as are three of the five in the race for deputy: Stella Creasy, Caroline Flint and Angela Eagle. One of the three likely contenders for the next Tory leadership is a woman, Theresa May. The next leader of Scottish Labour is likely to be Kezia Dugdale, and she will find herself debating two other female leaders, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Tories’ Ruth Davidson. Half of the shadow cabinet is female, and there are seven women in the cabinet. The most powerful politician in the European Union and perhaps the world is Angela Merkel.  But these eye-catching facts conceal an uncomfortable truth: remarkably high proportions of the most successful women in politics are childless. (All the named politicians above are, except Cooper and Flint.)   This is what makes Yvette Cooper so unusual. Most women in Britain have children - but very few female politicians do. Yet it's a life-defining experience. It's not a cliche to say that you don't understand stress and self-sacrifice till you've gone through it."
LabourUK,3dikfa,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a cliche, but that doesn't mean it isn't true!  I notice the author didn't mention the mayoral contest in that section. I know Diane Abbott has at least one son. What about Tessa Jowell?"
LabourUK,3dikfa,P_Ferdinand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"Tessa has two children.  And of course Margaret Thatcher had two children, but by all accounts they were neglected and palmed off on other people while she pursued her career, which is why her daughter avoided her in later years and her son ended up so badly (involved in a coup in Africa).  So a female politician who has children and they've turned out well is rarer than hen's teeth. Cooper and Flint are in a class of their own."
LabourUK,3dikfa,Suddenly_Elmo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"That's fucking ridiculous. Men don't go through the experience, yet we don't accuse them of not understanding stress and self-sacrifice because of it. Calling women out as not being proper women because they'd rather not make the decision to have kids is just insulting and backwards.   We've already had a large chunk of history where women were considered just there to carry babies, and it was awful. This attitude is hurting the independence of women."
LabourUK,3dikfa,JustAhobbyish,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:14 2015 UTC,"Male politicians go through the same experience as every other men. But the childless women are not experiencing what every other women experience.  It's not really about ""the independence of women"" - it's about a political class who simply have zero understanding of the female condition (men through no fault of their own because they are men, plus these childless female politicians - having women politicians was supposed to remedy this deficit, but we've got neutered women, who are being made to go through life as though they are men).   Don't you see, you are part of the problem. Because you are denigrating what women go through to give birth. The sickness, the pain, the anxiety of whether you are going to lose the baby (50% of pregnancy results in miscarriage), the lack of sympathy from employers, the trauma of birth, the post-natal depression, the struggle to look after the helpless infant, the callousness of employers in not understanding that you can't be late to pick up your child from school, the expense of it all - all this is a big fat nothing according to the likes of you. How dare we ask for politicians who understand what we're going through - what we are experiencing is nothing special. Yet in reality it's everything. Life itself would not exist without us."

Jeremy will only win if he has a decent support base throughout the party and its supporters, and if he doesn't then he won't.  Same with the other three.  If the system can return someone who doesn't as the next Labour leader, we have bigger problems."

LabourUK,3dikl9,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"Apologies for clouding this post with multiple replies, but I thought I'd say this separately so it can be down/upboated on its own merits.  Some admittedly biased thoughts on what Umunna's saying about Jeremy:   Weak on defence   As someone pointed out at the Leeds hustings, a nuclear deterrent is absolutely pointless when your main enemy is a free-flowing, rapidly expanding idea.  We can't end ISIS by nuking them.  Sure, we have tensions in Russia too, but a) they're quite nebulous at the moment from a UK threat point of view, b) we're hardly the only nation that'll be affected, and c) is there anything we can't just solve with conventional warfare?  Everything else is paper tigers, really.  I don't see how we defend ourselves by thrusting weapons of mass destruction in people's faces and daring them to defy us.  We're not even that internationally relevant anymore, and there are people dying on the streets that the Trident money could easily go towards helping, provided we can sort out the issues of job losses and international commitments.   Giving the impression that we are more concerned with those who won’t work, who can work, I don’t think is a way that we’re going to be able to win over people.   For f**k's sake I'm sick and tired of this dichotomy coming from the Tories, let alone Labour.  If we're going to champion the welfare state, we need to point out that there are people who genuinely do need it--and there are people who genuinely need it--and they're being given a rough ride by people cherry-picking genuine systematic abuses and trying to paint everyone like that.  If we don't want to give that impression, how about we engage in a conversation with voters about all these utterly baseless assumptions that the Tories and the media (don't argue that the media is blameless in all this, we have things like Benefits Street and Immigration Street that are turning mild-mannered working-class people into frothing hate machines that'll happily throw their own peers under the bus) have got people to believe in, instead of either burying our head in the sand and pretending they aren't there or assuming that the electorate are utterly immovable by any sort of argument whatsoever?  (Hat off to Tom Watson, who's already doing this)   Giving the impression that we want to beat up on your employer, who gives you your pay and your hours every week, I don’t think is a particularly good look either.   Again, false dichotomy.  We don't have to choose between calling all employers evil blood-suckers or saintly wealth creators to whom everyone, including people on desperately shitty contracts or workfare or zero-hours, should prostrate and thank for their bottomless charity.  Truth is there are good employers and bad employers, and as the party of workers Labour should reward the good and punish the bad.  Also, this is an image concern rather than an ideological one IMO: a lot of people in Labour have already gone on record as saying that they (and many voters!) agreed with Ed's policies on zero-hours contracts, but hated the 'predators and producers' rhetoric."

As for nuclear disarmament, I doubt it's a huge issue on the UKIP voter's mind. Many voters left to UKIP just because Farage appealed to them as someone who cares for the working class. Those are the people we need to win back, and Corbyn is the only candidate who I believe can do it.   Not... Really. I advise you to read up on a planned economy. Having some things that are publicly-owned does not a planned economy make.   Publicly owned and financially regulated, so I think it counts.

They're not coming back if we're just a little more like the Tories. That's a fantasy. To imply that the only places on the left are the Greens is just cartoon politics. By far the biggest chunk of the electorate is not tribal first of all, they want people and policy that they buy into, not Left/Right. That's for the (tiny) minority who join parties and inhabit parts of the internet like this. Getting fixated on left/right is a sure fire way to miss the point and where the electorate are.  Secondly, you assume the Lib Dems and UKIP are right wing, when in many of their more popular areas they are further left than Labour have been.  The data shows we lost because we didn't convince the vote to come out and we didn't target the Lib Dem losses as well as the Tories (plus some well played electioneering and a terrible campaign from us, and I say that as a Miliband fan).

This is why I'm going partially for Cooper at the moment as well, who whilst supporting a surplus, understands why we might want to run a deficit in the future - more importantly she's a lot more convincing than Kendall."

Some people say that Labour lost the last election because of 'shy tories' or them not seeming economically competent, but I think it's just because Labour didn't have a strong and vivid image of the UK that came to the public's imagination when they heard the words 'Labour UK'. The Lib Dems had (and still do have) a similar problem, and it's been a disaster for both. I believe Labour needs a strong identity, and if that means losing a few MPs that make the party look like it has no ambitions beyond being a weak opposition that doesn't offer a better alternative to the Tories, and taking a a risk, I say so be it."

LabourUK,3dhfc1,gamas,2,Thu Jul 16 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I hope everyone who was all 'Let's have a proper leadership debate by including someone who doesn't want to be leader' is kicking themselves now.   No, I'm not kicking myself. The people voting in this election are all fully paid members and supporters of the party. If we're giving money to the party, we damn well want the party to represent our views. The members are saying they want Labour to adopt more left-wing views, so it is Labour's job (if they want us to continue giving them money) to address that concern.  Now I had hoped Jeremy's involvement would push the other three candidates into realising they need a more left wing platform (and for Yvette and Andy, that has worked to an extent as they have started taking more left-wing stances than they were before the debates), but none of them have really risen to what the party members want.  If Jeremy has shown himself to be the only candidate close enough to the views of the party members to be worth considering, then that is entirely on the other candidates for not realising who they are trying to represent, not the people who asked for Jeremy's nomination. It's not my problem if the only response by the other candidates is to engage in a ""DAE think our members are lefty commie morons"" circlejerk. If Corbyn wins and then subsequently loses the next generation election, then the party only has itself to blame for not presenting another option that had more reasonable stances whilst still being compatible with the members' views... Seriously, if one of the candidates was basically just slightly-left of Miliband whilst being 100x more charismatic, I would have been happy. I actually kinda like Andy, but I think he has the same level of charisma as Miliband, and I have difficulty believing he would be a firm opposition... he seems to cave too easily which is something that won't be good in either opposition or as prime minister.  When I joined the party, I didn't realise the party was so anti-democracy....  EDIT: If I'm honest though, the homeopathy and stuff about foreign relations are making me flaky about Corbyn, I'm torn between choosing Yvette as I believe she is the best of both worlds (in terms of presenting a centre-left platform whilst being charismatic), and choosing Corbyn because the party needs to start having some firm platform to stand on - a dodgy platform is better for a political party than no platform."
LabourUK,3dhfc1,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not anti-democracy. If the ballot was for the 'Let's have a debate' election, Jeremy Corbyn would make a fine addition. But it wasn't. It was for the leadership election. So why did we put someone on the ballot who had no intention of leading the party?  Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper both have thoroughly reasonable and respectable left-wing views. So does Kendall, although I will concede that she hasn't really gotten them across in a way that the members liked.  But the ultimate problem is, the views of members' who support Corbyn are simply incompatible with 'reasonable stances'. Was it 'reasonable' to put someone on the ballot who didn't want to win that ballot? No. Is it 'reasonable' to then campaign and vote for that same person, knowing that they don't want to win? No. Is it reasonable to elect that same leader when it is virtually a mathematical fact that he cannot win a general election? No! Will it be reasonable to demand of the PLP that they stand by a leader who they have made it abundantly clear they do not and cannot support? I don't think so.  So, if Corbyn wins, and the party, whether it's anti-democratic or not, is completely shattered by the election of a leader whom large chunks of the party, including its elected representatives, don't support, will that be an improvement on the current 'anti-democratic' situation?"
LabourUK,3dhfc1,gamas,2,Thu Jul 16 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"The point, however, is, like it or not, if Corbyn wins then the views of members' who support Corbyn are the majority of member payments of the Labour party. You say ""large chunks of the party, including its elected representatives, don't support"" - but if he won the leadership election then clearly those who don't support him are the minority in the party.  However, the impression I've got (and one I agree with) is that Corbyn isn't actually what the members want though, it's just the closest they are being offered. What the members actually want is an English ""Nicola Sturgeon"" - someone with a reasonable and passionate anti-austerity platform, who holds a strong and genuine passion in all aspects of what they believe in. The hope had been that Jeremy's presence would drag Yvette and Andy (we never expected to really drag Liz as she was meant to represent the other side of the debate) to that position, and whilst they have moved quite significantly towards he, they don't seem to have the passion that can really drive the Labour campaign.  ...Honestly though, the homeopathy business is making me consider switching my order to make Yvette my first preference with Corbyn second just to send the message.  EDIT: And by considering I now mean after two hours of thinking, I have now definitely switched to supporting Yvette... I am a democratic socialist at heart, but I can't support someone who is willing to dismiss all evidence just for the sake of personal ideology. It's the main reason I couldn't bring myself to support the Green Party, and the reason I am now dismissing Corbyn.  EDIT2: I do think people in both the party and particularly this subreddit need to calm the fuck down about Corbyn though. Yes, he's not going to be the saviour of the party, but he's not going to be a complete disaster either. If Labour collapses as a result of his selection, it was only because everyone in the party got so caught up in panic and hysteria that they descended into large scale infighting... All this talk about Corbyn potentially destroying the party and threatening to splinter off if Labour selects the wrong candidate is going to do more harm to the party than Corbyn being elected..."

Think about it- when the Tories were going full ""Red Ed"" back in 2012 or so, Labour's poll ratings barely flickered; I guess the attacks just don't register much to the public. On the other hand, the public reacted depressingly well to:   Stabbed his brother in the back. In the SNPs pocket. Can't eat a bacon sandwich. Wrecked the economy. Looks a bit like Wallace without Grommet. Can you picture him in a room with Putin?   If Miliband was too left wing, both Cooper and Burnham are screwed.

Arguably the reason that Blair won a landslide is because Thatcher had gradually squandered her economic political capital over her years in power, and then Major dropped the ball properly with the ERM fiasco. But the fact that Blair's Third Way routine seemed more economically literate than Major's Tories doesn't mean that Major was perceived as more left wing...  I'll grant you Welfare though, and add Immigration as another potential left/right landmine. But seeing as neither Cooper nor Burnham, nor even Kendall (on the immigration front at least) really promise anything outside of Labour's normal playbook on these issues, I'm still not sure I see the point.  Corbyn's radical leftism would be an electoral disaster, but I just don't buy the argument that that has the slightest thing to do with our 2015 manifesto.  Furthermore, we really need to avoid picking easy answers to the question ""why we lost in 2015"".

LabourUK,3ddopy,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Wed Jul 15 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"No. The SNP did not win because they were left of Labour, they won because 45% of Scots support nationalism. The Scots are not to the left of the rest of the country ideologically. The SNP are not, for the most part, to the left of Labour policy-wise. And, even if we had held every single Labour seat in Scotland, the Tories would still have a majority. This isn't even to tackle the obvious point that, had we gone left to win votes in Scotland (which wouldn't have worked) we'd have then lost more votes to the right in the rest of the country (and, indeed, Scotland).  As for my Foot/Miliband comparison, I'm going to phrase it as a quiz show question:   Which leader of the Labour Party took over as leader after a general election loss by a former-Chancellor-turned-PM who'd never won one, was perceived as very left-wing by the public, failed the 'blink test', was unable to deal with the insurgency of another left-of-centre party, played to what he thought his party's strengths were, and, despite taking on a government with a damning record of economic failure, ended up with even fewer seats than his predecessor?   I know I'm stretching my point a little by saying Corbyn and Miliband are both heirs to Foot, but I don't think it's entirely spurious.  Also, I'm sure there's some joke about Labour having two left feet buried in there, but I can't quite bring it out."
LabourUK,3ddopy,DELB_,4,Wed Jul 15 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"they won because 45% of Scots support nationalism   This is such a lazy answer.

Do you think they all went from being Labour- and Lib Dem-supporting unionists in 2010 to being SNP supporters in 2015 for the sole reason that the suddenly decided they preferred an independent Scotland, in a vacuum from any ideological concerns? Or perhaps they felt that Labour and the Lib Dems no longer represented their interests?   The Scots are not to the left of the rest of the country ideologically   Why have they managed to return a grand total of 1 MP for a right-wing party in the last two elections?

LabourUK,3ddopy,JustAhobbyish,4,Wed Jul 15 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"Disgruntled protest voters who voted Lib Dem flocked en masse to the SNP, at the same time as Scottish Labour was entering into terminal decline for a variety of reasons. The SNP have been very lucky in their political weather, and have been effective politicians besides - their record in Government has not been especially far Left (eg NHS spending has grown slower than it has done in England under the Tories), but they've picked a few lightning rod issues (eg Trident, opposition to austerity stemming from London) knowing they'll never have any control over that."
LabourUK,3ddopy,Bialoveld,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"Why? All sorts of reasons. Right now, they're tempted by the prospect of some kind of get out of jail free card from austerity. There's also an ingrained hatred of the Tories, which stems not so much from ideological differences as the Tories' quite genuine history of ignoring and neglecting the Scots.  The YouGov findings are, as the author admits, not in line with other findings and didn't actually use a very good methodology. The more recent British Social Attitudes Survey found that there was virtually no evidence that the Scots were to the left of the rest of the country, even on supposedly totemic issues like Trident, austerity and tuition fees.  So, in fact, it's the 'The SNP won because they're left-wing' answer that's a) lazy and b) inaccurate. The 'No, they won because they're nationalists' answer might not cover all the necessary ground, but at least it's starting out on the right track.  My detailed answer is that they won because the deck is rigged. They realised they could push for headline policies that would never actually happen (like scrapping Trident) or were actually shit at doing what they said on the tin (like scrapping tuition fees to help poor kids -- it doesn't), but would win votes and make them stand out from Labour. Then when anyone says, 'Hang on, but Scotland's still got all the same problems as England and you've done nothing -- nothing -- to fix them', they get away (so far) with implying that 'if only' they could get away from the UK they could actually sort things out.  EDIT: I should be clearer about Trident: Saying 'We'll scrap Trident' is win-win for the SNP because people who want it scrapped all vote for it and people who don't want it scrapped know they can't actually make it happen so they can safely vote for them. Labour are in no position to do this."

This so called progressive majority does not exist, I'm sorry. Foot tried it and got battered for various reasons. Kinnock almost won on a centre-left, intelligent platform but set the foundations for 1997 by kicking the entryists out. Miliband tried his 35% progressive majority by focusing on inequality (his great legacy too will be focusing on inequality) but sadly it failed.   Relying on non-voters to actually turn out is such a poor idea considering they are clearly already less likely to vote.

He will be torn apart by the press so hard.  ""Strength of the campaigns"" - Doesn't matter who the leader is that much, the campaign strength needs good spin and a united team that has trust in each other and clarity of role - Miliband's electional team failed.  ""Labour fared in the last election in one constituency"" 24 Tories sit in seats with a majority of less than 3,000, some of those their 2nd opposition are Lib Dems!

The same search also led me to a paywalled article in the Times Higher Education Supplement saying that the UK overall has the lowest dropout rate in Europe, which goes to show that the SNP's failure in that area is pretty spectacular.  'scotland fall in number of teachers' gives a lot of stats about the fall in the number of teachers, which the SNP blame on 'austerity' even though it's proportionally higher than the UK's fall.  As a former teacher, I really don't need anyone telling me about how bad the Tories have been for education.

(They could have raised income tax but decided not to do so).  P.S. it was similar in the 1960's - university was free, but paid for by sending 90% of the population to shitty secondary moderns that didn't teach anything academic and thus didn't need expensive maths teachers etc, just some cheapo staff who could teach woodwork, metalwork etc.  I don't know why people eulogise the bad old days, they were awful."

And in 2011 backed Early Day Motion 1820:   That this House welcomes the campaign by the Homeopathy Research Institute (HRI) to place homeopathy research on the national agenda as a credible scientific field of inquiry; notes that the HRI is an innovative charity that does not promote the practice of homeopathy itself, but rather promotes and facilitates scientific research into homeopathy,of which the most controversial aspect is the use ofhighly diluted medicines; acknowledges that, in the UK, the practice of homeopathy has been part of the National Health Service (NHS) since its inception, and since thattime homeopathic medicines have been prescribable to patients; observes that the Faculty of Homeopathy Act 1950 states that the public has access to homeopathy under the NHS so long as patients demand it and doctors are trained to provide it; and calls on the Government to facilitate research into this important area to ascertain the effectiveness of homeopathy.   So he believes it should prescribed to people with conditions as broad and serious as musculoskeletal conditions to allergies and IBS, and wants to see the government fund yet more research into the dead horse of a subject.  He's also a staunch backer of herbal remedies, which is slightly less controversial, but does provide context for his interest in ""alternative"" medicines."

LabourUK,3devzl,Kalissss,2,Thu Jul 16 11:45:09 2015 UTC,Now an article on the independent website on it....my joke RT has somehow become a fully fledged debate
LabourUK,3devzl,NigelFromage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:23:30 2015 UTC,More power to your elbow!  Lets see if you can repeat it with other stuff!
LabourUK,3devzl,NigelFromage,0,Thu Jul 16 12:32:37 2015 UTC,He complained that the Science and Technology Committee said correctly that homeopathy didn't work and shouldn't be in the NHS.   He wants it to be in the NHS - he wants to give sick people stuff that doesn't work.  He's an old dimwit with a bad education. But what's your excuse for wanting a dimwit to lead the Labour party?
LabourUK,3devzl,Kingy_who,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:38 2015 UTC,Title is a bit of a stretch/clickbait. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for homeopathy.  One could go right back and dig up Cooper's expenses or forensically analyse Burnham's LGBT record too; none of the candidates are perfect. Ultimately I think these smears from all sides are just silly and add nothing to the debate.
LabourUK,3devzl,Kingy_who,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"Do dig up Coopers expenses or Burnham's LGBT record - lets look at it all.  But don't bury stuff about Corbyn and try to shut down the discussion as a ""smear"". A ""smear"" is a claim that isn't true. But Jeremy Corbyn really really wants to give sick people stuff that doesn't work. Why do you think that's a good idea?"
LabourUK,3devzl,Suddenly_Elmo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"I just fail to see the point in doing so. Do you believe this adds anything of merit to debate about the future of the party? To me it's a negative circlejerk that trivialises/sidelines the issues that matter. This is going for all the candidates (I actually do think Kendall gets misrepresented a lot).  ""Corbyn really really wants to give sick people stuff that doesn't work. Why do you think that's a good idea?"" This is the sort of hyperbole and vitriol that makes any argument about this topic so petty in the first place. I don't support homeopathy, and this article doesn't exactly show Corbyn to be outright endorsing it either."
LabourUK,3devzl,Suddenly_Elmo,0,Wed Jul 15 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Corbyn definitely believes in it. See  http://skeptical-voter.org/index.php?title=Jeremy_Corbyn#Homeopathy   Jeremy Corbyn was one of 206 MPs to sign the March 2007 Early Day Motion 1240 calling for the positive recognition of NHS homeopathic hospitals[1].  Following the publication of the House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee's report ""Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy"" in February 2010, Corbyn signed Early Day Motion 908: Science and Technology Committee Report on Homeopathy, which was critical of the report[2].  He was asked on Twitter why he had signed EDM 908[3]. He replied:  jeremycorbyn @leftoutside I believe that homeo-meds works for some ppl and that it compliments 'convential' meds. they both come from organic matter... (7:33 PM Mar 5th)[4]  In May 2011, Jeremy Corbyn signed Early Day Motion 1820 which welcomed a campaign to ""place homeopathy research on the national agenda as a credible scientific field of inquiry"" and called for the Government to facilitate research into homeopathy[5].   .   Do you believe this adds anything of merit to debate about the future of the party?   Of course it does. Corbyn believes in giving people stuff that has no more than a placebo effect.   Now we keep getting told Corbyn's ideas are just as valid as anyone else's. Se lets debate this. The NHS spends billions on drugs. Should we save the money and give them water or sugar pills, 'cause Corbyn likes them? Or should we resist on the grounds that people will die. Hey! We're having a debate on policy."
LabourUK,3dd1tv,Ajnin123,6,Wed Jul 15 09:01:21 2015 UTC,"Or we can just stop with this stupid 'big state/small state' shite and work on a 'what works and delivers social justice' basis. I'm sorry but one aspect i'm really tired of the entire global centre-left pandering to is 'big government is baaaddd'. This whole concept was drawn up by lunatics like F.A. Hayek who tried to draw some kind of connection between work safety laws=big government=Nazi Germany inevitably. I could not care one iota for the size and scope of a democratically-run state, and continuously raising 'big government' as if its some kind of inherent problem in left-wing politics does us no favours at all, and seems to validate the likes of the Libertarian right (who, might I add, were content to back men like Pinochet. They hate big government until their ideology is wearing the jackboot). While I'm certainly no advocate of a massive government role in the economy, I'm also not an advocate of 'small government'. Saying 'well its big government' is a total non-argument, real arguments consist of hard, practical evidence, results and applications towards the completion of objectives, not philosophical abstracts about how 'big' the state is."
LabourUK,3ddbaf,Patch86UK,9,Wed Jul 15 11:12:19 2015 UTC,"I have two main objections to this as a concept.  1) Who will lead it? If the Party's main leader also leads the English party, that would only reinforce the view that the Scottish and Welsh parties are ""branch offices"". If it's a new character, how do they share responsibility with running the national party with the proper leader?  2) What would they actually do? Scottish and Welsh Labour make sense because of their relationship to the devolved legislatures. There's no English Parliament or equivalent, and no obvious room for yet another Leader personality in the EVEL plans. Would the English Labour Party be as irrelevant as the English Regional parties are now- a pointless talking shop and extra layer of bureaucracy?  Simply inventing it isn't enough- it also has to do something..."

LabourUK,3dbkxv,redowl,6,Wed Jul 15 00:21:53 2015 UTC,"One aspect of the plans is an effort to weaken the union levy in order to reduce Labour's funding. (Whereas wealthy individuals making large donations is fine though, obviously.)  The plans also seek to allow businesses to hire agency workers to replace striking workers.  It's difficult to see it as anything other than an assault on Labour Party funding, and more importantly, the Labour movement at large."

LabourUK,3da4p1,rappersdo,9,Tue Jul 14 18:09:56 2015 UTC,A clearly passionate and convicted politician. Hopefully more like her can send the message Labour it needs to present a new politics of hope and represent the working people it once stood for. The SNP surge in Scotland clearly shows how out of touch Labour are becoming.
LabourUK,3da4p1,Ajnin123,10,Tue Jul 14 19:13:35 2015 UTC,I think it says something that a 20 year old is more inspiring than any of our leadership candidates.
LabourUK,3da4p1,JustAhobbyish,6,Tue Jul 14 19:48:22 2015 UTC,How do you connect to voters like the SNP has done?  Becoming part of the community.   Labour needs to present hope but needs to avoid the trap from the Tory party. Rather good speech but shows you just how big the problem is for the party. Needs to win the media war and win people back.
LabourUK,3da4p1,Ajnin123,2,Tue Jul 14 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"This comment is a good read on how the SNP are doing so well campaigning. They're connecting to voters about issues that actually affect them and spreading their message effectively. This is part of the reason why I support Creasy, because the more we regenerate the youth vote, the better we can campaign and spread our message."
LabourUK,3da4p1,JustAhobbyish,3,Tue Jul 14 22:40:16 2015 UTC,Creasy so far has me keeping a eye on her.  Also that comment is quite useful :)  Watson has the same idea but Creasy has the detail.
LabourUK,3da4p1,Smoka_GB,6,Tue Jul 14 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, this was inspiring, I actually thought she was Labour. Until she said ""Like so many, I feel that it is the Labour party that left me, not the other way about"". And quoting Tony Benn, she sounds more Labour than most of Labour do!  The cancerous legacy from Blair and New Labour is what needs to change. Like, for instance Caroline Flint is one that sounds more Tory Lite than Labour."

LabourUK,3da4p1,AnxiousMo-Fo,-5,Tue Jul 14 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"I suppose she's happy about being one of the relatively few working class Scots of her generation who went to -- and completed -- uni, after the SNP locked them out by destroying schools and abolishing grants to fund their headline-grabbing tuition fee abolition.  I don't give a fuck if she can make a good speech. The SNP are cynical, evil bastards. If she isn't a bastard herself, she's a dupe."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Ajnin123,8,Tue Jul 14 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, it makes a change for Owen to be advocating some sort of policy, rather than just saying what's wrong. On the other, I feel he has now jumped the shark."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Cavernwight,3,Wed Jul 15 07:05:22 2015 UTC,At heart I'm a European federalist but I'm pessimistic even the current state of the EU if Germany can't help Greece out without having to be so self serving.
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Kingy_who,3,Wed Jul 15 08:41:29 2015 UTC,"Well, he's kind of got a point. If Cameron's negotiation leaves us with no employment or social protections, one of the main purposes of the EU will have been knocked away, and it's hard to see how we can get it back.  If Cameron goes in demanding that the service sector is made properly part of the free market, that should do wonders for the economy (hopefully our new leader will demand and/or support this), and we may then be able to back remaining in the EU.  All depends on the outcome. All this absolutist 'We should vote for X whatever happens' stuff isn't very helpful."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Wed Jul 15 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"I've lost faith in the EU sadly after seeing what has happened to Greece. I have given it a chance for years.

Protect our right to govern and our right to sovereign and remember, the ""Labour"" movement came about to protect the rights of the workers, if you stay in the EU, you can throw a lot of those bits of protection away.    Don't even go there with a ""United States of Europe"" because you can kiss parliament goodbye.

LabourUK,3dbdb7,DELB_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:09:39 2015 UTC,I believe the best interest in our country is to be part of a European marketplace and make some rules Europe wide for all countries. The same way being part of NATO or the UN means some rules that we abide by aren't made in Westminster.

One species, a shared environment and downtrodden working people suffering austerity everywhere. The economy has gone global, and we shouldn't take a step in the regressive direction now... The EU can be a vehicle for socialists and lefties who fight for the rights of ordinary people to come together and do what they've been doing separately together. Our movements are founded on solidarity, and we shouldn't underestimate the power of cooperation.  If the EU is denigrating the left, then our job is to make it better, not abandon it at the first sign of adversity."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Subotan,3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:51 2015 UTC,"How can you reform what is undemocratic at it's highest levels? You say it can be a vehicle for socialists, we've been hearing that for years and it hasn't materialised.   The sad fact is if we pull out now the right will reap the biggest benefits from it, but long-term we'd be in a better position democratically to break away from neoliberal politics.   I'm currently undecided on which is the lesser of two evils, there's arguments to make on both sides, right now I'm swaying towards out but a lot can change in a year or two."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Soodings,4,Wed Jul 15 00:47:36 2015 UTC,"The EU has reformed repeatedly if unevenly since its formation as the European Coal and Steel Community, so whilst it's clear that this time is going to be harder, it's hardly some Herculean task.  Thing is, the argument which stems from the EU not being democratic enough isn't ""Let's leave the EU"" but ""Let's make the EU more democratic""."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,DELB_,2,Wed Jul 15 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"As u/Subotan said, ours is then to improve the EU democratically rather than abandon it. In doing so we're leaving the fight for other politically sensible Europeans, distancing ourselves from allies in other countries.  I'm not sure how you envision overcoming British neoliberalism (more tied to America than Europe in my view, particularly where foreign policy is concerned) as an easier task without Europe than with it. These people are liberally minded to begin with, and its only a short step from there to a fundamentally more compassionate political system."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,Subotan,2,Wed Jul 15 09:45:05 2015 UTC,Dare I say it but I think the EU is acting more like a communist union (I would have said state but communism doesn't even want a state) rather than a socialist state.  BUREAUCRATICALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS.  NOT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS.  It's only benefiting the German bankers and the French bankers.  Ask yourself the question: why Germany's economy is getting stronger and why other states are getting weaker?  It's not rocket science (hint: TTIP).

The difference between ideological rhetoric and practical governance which was particularly stark in the USSR. A soviet is a workers' council where people agree on how to proceed together, making collective political decisions. This is pretty much the antithesis to the USSR post-1921 - it was a dictatorial regime -and hence highlights the difference between words used and actions taken."
LabourUK,3dbdb7,rappersdo,3,Fri Jul 17 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"I think the EU doesn't work because of lack of integration, some laws set in some places some in others.

Creating the worlds largest economy. The eurozone is flawed, the EU has potential. It does the job for part of the world that the UN should for the whole, but Russia. We should be a planet united, not a planet of closed countries. All people should be born equal and it helps tremendously with that."

The poor, poor Greeks are having all of their public services privatised, high VAT, huge corporation tax on small businesses -- seriously, the EU is taking the absolute mick.

Labour is having a crisis because all these middle-aged career politicans seem to know nothing about playing politics to win elections like the Tories and nothing about real issues facing people today, that's a losing combination.   Labour talk about reinvigorating the youth vote, but I can tell you every young person sees Labour as the party that introduced tuition fees that their parents vote for.  We've become the party that knows the price of nothing and the value of nothing. Voting Corbyn may not even change that, but I'm not particularly insspired by anyone, Cooper keeps going on about hi-tech science jobs and them alone, Burnham is talking about the 'Westminster bubble' that he's not a part of apparently because he's got a northern accent.

Just a shame that I know we won't win in 2020. Not saying much is it?  We need another Blair in terms of personality and charisma.

We need a gamechanger, we need someone that's not weird, like Ed but not too normal like Kinnock, not slick, like Blair but not reserved like Brown. They also can't be connected with the Blair/Brown years and they need to unify the party.   I think I've just ruled out everyone standing for leader.

LabourUK,3daava,Patch86UK,3,Tue Jul 14 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you're comparing a political discussion forum of a whole country to a specific forum about American Liberals which support one candidate. They've even gone as far to raise £30,000 for him in just a few months"
LabourUK,3daava,Patch86UK,4,Tue Jul 14 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. Maybe you misunderstood me- I'm saying that that's phenomenal that a sub dedicated to a single (relatively niche, in the grand scheme of things) candidate for a single faction in a single party would be approaching twice the size of a sub for a whole country's political scene, and approaching the size of the main sub for the whole of the UK, is remarkable.   How many times before do you think 62,000 Labour Party supporters have ever communcated directly in that way? Even adjusting for the fact that the US has five times the population, that'd still be the equivalent of 12,000 Labour supporters in one forum. As a movement, I think we'd kill for that sort of engagement."
LabourUK,3daava,itsdanprice,3,Tue Jul 14 21:27:59 2015 UTC,Agreed but we have no one like him. The leadership contenders are pretty woeful tbh. Corbyn has the right ideas but for me he's not a leader who can inspire.
LabourUK,3daava,Soodings,2,Tue Jul 14 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"You raise a fair point. Corbyn advocates for some fairly non-controversial stuff most of the time such nationalising the rails, gas & electricity, votes for 16, abolishing tuition fees e.t.c - even most Conservatives support that! What we need though is a supporter which can be convincing and non-alienating enough to gain support for these ideas on both sides of the debate."
LabourUK,3daava,Soodings,3,Tue Jul 14 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"You've absolutely hit the nail on the head. I like to think of Corbyn as Blair, a candidate I can get excited for, but with better ideas and a slightly less polished image (which any thinking man knows is a bunch of bollocks to begin with). The reason we need to push for him as leader is his role in representing principled change that benefits the vast majority of the population. You paint yourself as the candidate of the people against that of those with undue control over our system, and you have a real shot at power. This is what people need, we have to make them want it."
LabourUK,3daava,itsdanprice,3,Tue Jul 14 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"I'd argue his having the right ideas is enough to inspire. Before mass media that was all politicians were judged on. Ideas are what count after all, and you and I can agree that Corbyn is more likely to stick to his guns and look after the little guy. That's why he needs our support: he may not be the most attractive politician but he would do the best by the people of this country."
LabourUK,3daava,Soodings,3,Tue Jul 14 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"Your ideas need to be heard, and to fight the ruthless right wing fuckery of the media you need to weave them into a simple cohesive narrative. I like Corbyn, he reminds me of an awesome teacher I used to have. I just worry that his great strengths could be his weakness.  Whats needed is exactly what he calls for, a social movement, that changes the game we're currently playing: Osbourne's neo con merry go round. He is going to need an awesome team around him to help him change the game."

I'm no Blairite and I'm not backing Kendall because I don't think she has Blair's vision or charisma, but I wish some people would come to terms with his legacy and the genuinely good things implemented under his leadership rather than screeching for a lurch left and a long stay in (principled) opposition, which is pointless. Realise that he changed the country for the better overall, play up his achievements (minimum wage, civil partnerships, devolution, Sure Start etc), and capture a broad left/centre swathe. As for the whole internal struggle, I'm reminded of a few words from Kinnock.  ""We have to win. We must not permit any purpose to be superior for the Labour movement than that purpose"""
LabourUK,3d8h4i,Bialoveld,3,Tue Jul 14 10:34:33 2015 UTC,"I agree we have to win but there will be no point in winning if we are as bad as the Tories. I don't think we ever have been or any of the leadership candidates will do that.  We also need to show we can be a force for equality even if we aren't in power.

My biggest problem with his legacy is his relationship with the unions. I mean, he boasted, like actually pridefully, that UK now had the most repressive union laws in Europe.

LabourUK,3d8h4i,TrickyDickNixonbot,8,Tue Jul 14 09:36:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, The Spectator often has interesting writing about the Labour Party. It's more interested in understanding Labour than Labour is in understanding the Tories."
LabourUK,3d8h4i,TrickyDickNixonbot,5,Tue Jul 14 10:37:43 2015 UTC,"We had some intellectually stimulating conversation about Red Tories here a few months ago. The humane branch of the Tories that, in the event they take power, would have the ability to be more radical than Labour in their vision while sweeping in a broad coalition of centre-right, centre and centre-left voters. Those are the ones we've got to be really careful of in the future, because they'd take one version of the Labour vision and render it conservative.   However right now we're living in the triumph of Thatcherism, which is injecting itself with evermore steroids as privatisation and marketisation becomes even more rampant, pointless and unproductive, yet is lapped up because to most people the alternative is a disjointed, uncomprising and dogmatic Labour Party."
LabourUK,3d8h4i,Kingy_who,5,Tue Jul 14 11:15:48 2015 UTC,"Thats the problem with Labour right now, we dont concede to the public on things the public wants. We brow-beat the public with dogmatic ideas (glaring at the Labour left) and claim they're all media brainwashed Murdoch slaves, which isn't exactly a way to win votes, or even function as a credible party. A leader who can understand where compromise and consensus needs to be made, but can bring a uniquely Labour set of policies elsewhere that people will want, is the kind of leader we need. While I dont think Kendall has the overall vision for the latter, she does have the former. But of course, yells of 'RED TORY!' from inbedded party activists with Clause IV tattooed on their back is a vigorous and academic argument."
LabourUK,3d8h4i,Ajnin123,4,Tue Jul 14 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Liz doesn't represent that, she represents a Blairite dogma not even shared by Blair."

Part of me originally hoped he'd just be ousted in a coup after a year or so, but its looking like hes going to be appointing his Marxist whackjob buddies to every high position possible, and probably launching a Stalin-style purge of the party of all non-socialist dissent. We're going to be seeing a whole lot more of the likes of Dianne Abbott, thats guaranteed.   I find Corbyn's words pretty offensive as well, if not outright disgustingly ignorant at times. His willingness to slam the West for perceived crimes while upholding a smorgasbord of dictators and terrorist groups as paragons of liberty and justice is astounding. Honestly the title of 'The Man Who Hates Britain' would be inaccurate even, hes more worthy of 'The Man Who Hates Western Democracy'. Its a classic New Left stream of consciousness, and its going to create electoral ruin.  SDP Mk. 2 is incoming with a Corbyn victory, by god it'd be a miracle if it doesn't happen."

If the next recession occurs close to an election, the hubris will unravel.

Yvette's team are spinning this as 'Yvette's the one who Tories fear!' on the grounds that hardly any of them want her in charge.  Frankly, interpreting this poll in any detail is basically impossible because there's no way of knowing how people were thinking when they answered. The top commenter there says they 'answered the question on the basis of who I'd vote for if I actually supported the Labour Party' and that was why they ended up with Yvette.

I was trying to think how I'd answer this question about the current Tory mayoral candidates and my answer is Zac Goldsmith, whether the question is 'Which candidate do I fear?', 'Which candidate would I back if I were a Tory?', and 'Given that there's a possibility the Tories will win, who would you like to be their candidate?'

That article deals with the expulsions.  But the real work was done in the branches to marginalise them. Their MO was to join a branch en masse (big groups of friends). they usually had no jobs so their subscriptions were very low and they had plenty of time. And they'd try to pack meetings and try to set agendas and get their group voted into the local EC.   Your normal branch member then grimly raced home after work, rushed to the meetings and tried to outvote them. It was tiring because you couldn't miss a single meeting in case you lost control of your branch. It was really a war of attrition which went on for years till we wore them out. Some militant people walked out when Blair became leader, but you still have them in some places.   Round where I am, two militant members stuck with the party and finally managed to get selected and elected as councillors in 2011. Then they promptly declared themselves independents, citing that Lab under EdM was too right wing (after staying through the Blair years!), once they'd used Lab to do the hard work of campaigning and leafleting to get themselves elected."
LabourUK,3d5w21,aenor,2,Mon Jul 13 20:34:18 2015 UTC,Was this the reason Foot became the leader? Some of his material was lifted right out of the Communist Manifesto
LabourUK,3d5w21,CMCyantist,11,Mon Jul 13 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"Oh gawd, the Foot saga.  Michael Foot was a lovely, lovely man, a patriot and someone who criticised Nazis in the 1930's before it was fashionable (and before Churchill did).  (Unlike that idiot Corbyn, Michael Foot supported the Falklands war and the right of the Falklanders to remain British if they wanted. He did not like the Facsist Junta running Argentina at all, they were killing socialists and anyone who got in their way - which is why it is so shameful Corbyn takes the stance he does. Indeed when the Argentinians took the lslands, Foot lambasted Thatcher so hard for withdrawing the South Atlantic Naval Patrol, which allowed the Argies to sneak in, that Thatcher left the chamber shaking and saying, ""My govt is on the line, I've got to get the islands back"").  At that time of his leadership election, the left of the party was dominated by Benn (who was not a Militant despite his many flaws), and left-wingers knew Benn wouldn't win and persuaded Foot to stand to defeat Denis Healey. There were growing numbers of Militant infiltrating the party during that period, but there was also a group to the right of Healey, the infamous gang of four, who decided that even if Healey won, they wanted out. So they plotted to set up their own party and then do a poison pill vote for Foot to scupper Lab with an academic style man who was unsuited to leadership. Foot duly won (voted in by two of Labour's enemies, Militant + SDP traitors), they departed to form the SDP and took hundreds of people with them and dozens of MPs.  With that wing of the party gone, Lab suddenly became lopsided. When the manifesto was written, the fed-up people in charge of writing it simply put in every single suggestion made to them - the idea was, we're going to lose, so let's put this crap in, so that the voters reject it and we can demonstrate to the left that this stuff is mad. However, I would say the bit about wanting to leave the EEC in that manifesto was pure Foot - he campaigned against joining in 1973 and thought it was a capitalist plot.  Fun fact 1: It was Michael Foot who got Tony Blair his seat in Parliament. He met him, was taken with how normal he seemed compared to all the Militant/Tatchell types swilling around and phoned Sedgefield. It was a new constituency, and the selection for it happened after the 1983 election was called. he was added to the shortlist and he won the seat. He was the very last selection in that election. And that was one of the few seats Lab won.  Fun Fact 2: Polly Toynbee was SDP. She stood for election in 1983 for Lewisham East. She got 22% of teh vote, which was enough to topple the Labour MP and let the Conservative sneak through the middle and win it. When I read her chuntering in the Guardian in 2010 about supporting the LibDems and a Lib-Lab coalition, my heart sank. And of course history repeated itself, the splitting of votes to the LibDems in 2010 let the Conservatives in."

EDIT: Oh, slightly more lighthearted story from another comrade: Someone else I know was in the Labour Party Young Socialists around the time they were trying to kick Militant out of the party (1982). Their university Labour Club hired a bus to conference, stopping a couple of times along the way. At the first service station stop, the moderate members passed around word to all the Militants that the bus was leaving in 15 minutes, and to all the non-Militants that it was leaving in 10.

LabourUK,3d5w21,rappersdo,3,Mon Jul 13 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Brown, I don't know why we gave up on that, the Tories brought us into a double-dip recession.   This requires a long exposition on Keynesian economics that i'll deliver if you want, but there's a reason Ed Balls (who penned economic policy) did not go anti-austerity. Our position was perfectly consistent with the Brown plan from that perspective. The fact the Tories cut the stimulus off before it was completed is what complicated everything.   That's your opinion but which public are you talking about? Scotland is mysteriously not part of this 'public' you're talking about? Or is it just a meteoric rise in nationalism between the day after the referendum and today? I somehow doubt it.   I will become convinced of Scotland's anti-'right-wing Labour' when the fact that Blair swept Scotland thrice and Brown swept it once ceases to be a fact and reality alters itself. The rejection of Labour was because of a meteoric rise in nationalism before and after the referendum, the phenomenon of Scottish nationalism in itself is a huge debate, and considering the SNP can be duplicitous as fuck (privatising ferries, advocating economic policies that impose billions more in cuts than Labour would have) without any widespread scrutiny further demonstrates that this goes beyond political agendas.   We lost because we didn't combat Tory lies, no-one believed Ed when he said he wouldn't form a coalition with the SNP and you seem to be forgetting that before the Tories started their campaign that the SNP would hold the balance of power they tried the 'Red Ed' campaign and no one gave a shit.   The Red Ed campaign, and the portrayal of Ed as a blithering geek by the media, were massively damaging. Writing it off wont get us anywhere. Labour being irresponsible with the money and socialism being fiscally irresponsible etc etc etc was a huge doorstep gripe I had to deal with from Reading to Sussex, as were complaints of ""im not voting Labour because Ed cant lead Britain'. In fact SNP fears almost took a back seat. I think Ed was an honest, sincere man, one of the best leaders we've had, but this is the TV age. In the TV age its about looking flashy and good for the camera and projecting confidence. As that one guy said on BBC, Ed Miliband 'was too fucking honest and good for Britain'   Do you really think the average voter is sat at home thinking ""Oh I tell you what that Ed Miliband seems like he'd create a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy, fuck that I need to vote Tory.""   While the average Libertarian probably was thinking that, no. The average voter was thinking 'oh Labour are those socialist guys and socialists spend a lot of money and we dont have much money so im not gonna vote for them. Also their leader is awkward and probably wouldnt make a good Prime Minister'. I can also run a few other thought processes for those who went and voted UKIP, which was a different kind of defection.   We offered no credible alternative, just the same austerity with a few sweeteners irrelevant to most people.   Then you clearly didn't read the manifesto. This is my problem with the Labour left, they have to try and dumb everything down into these stupid, outright false paradigms, and in turn you just back up the Tory narratives. We failed to argue our policies properly and combat the lies thrown at the Brown administration. There are immense reasons behind why we did not adopt 'anti-austerity' from a professional economic standpoint, and we certainly did not 'offer the same old austerity with sweeteners nobody cared about'. People dont go and vote Tory because Labour is too right-wing. Honestly if you think our platform was that bad, you might as well go and defect to the Greens. Also, if you think anti-austerity is somehow appealing to the British public right now, I suggest you go and check out the collapse of Greece under Syriza, the public face of the New Left in Europe, and the probable soon collapse of Spain when Podemos takes power."
LabourUK,3d5w21,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Tue Jul 14 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"Give Podemos a chance for fucks sake, show a bit of solidarity. The average voter does not think Labour are socialist, Jesus wept who have you been speaking to?    Socialism being fiscally irresponsible   What is written on the back of the party card? Democratic Socialism, and if you don't like it you can git out. I joke of course, but seriously why are you writing off socialism?   Every country set up as a socialist country has went against the principles of dialectical marxism and while I'm not advocating FULLCOMMUNISM, I think it's remarkably foolish to write off an entire ideology because it might be seen as a step backwards.   Here's the view of Ed from someone on the left of Labour, that I haven't seen mentioned. He was all over the place, at the start of his leadership he was talking about how he would break from New Labour and how he would bring socialist values to No.10 if elected.  By polling day he had hired Alistair Campbell as an adviser(someone who was very quick to criticise him after the election along with Umunna) and had given an interview saying he'd be the 'champion' to One-Nation Tories.   He made some great speeches about 'predatory' business that weren't expanded upon and he's now been characterised as anti-business. For me he tried to speak to the right of the party and the far-left and completely ignored the cente-left, alienating many voters up and down the country.  We lost in Scotland because the leader of Scottish Labour was a raging Blairite, we gave credence to the 'Red Tory' insult by running a pro-union campaign alongside the Tories, which Charles Kennedycan explain.  Trident was a big issue too and Labour offered no alternative, just less. We should not be saying ""We can do it better than the Tories."" We should be saying ""We will take a different approach.""

Thing is, I'm not particularly well off and if I'm renting would likely never raise the capital to put down the deposit on a London flat or house. Even in outer London or the home counties.   How will you make it better for low to medium paid workers to be able to afford a house or flat in London?"
LabourUK,3d4ik9,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Wed Jul 15 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"That is the most difficult issue facing Londoners and London. Building more homes is not the numbers game that Boris pretends it is.It is, rather, about building the right sort of homes - which are affordable to people like yourself. I would also flatten the fares structure so that people living further out where prices are lower are not penalised by such high fares. And as I mentioned above, I would create a blacklist of bad landlords to encourage a responsible rental market - but i do recognise how tough it is for young people like you."
LabourUK,3d4ik9,oliethefolie,5,Fri Jul 17 11:21:38 2015 UTC,"Would flattening fare structure include tube fares in inner zones going up still further to manage demand? Definitely like the idea of cheaper rail travel in to the centre, but realistically the trains are already overcrowded.  Does the network have capacity to allow lower fares (and therefore, in all likelihood, more people traveling) at peak times, or will you be working with businesses to try and shift more commuter travel outside of the high peaks?"
LabourUK,3d4ik9,TinyZoro,2,Fri Jul 17 11:41:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks Christian.  When you say, the ""right sort of homes"", what does that entail? Small properties? Rent controls?  What does flattening the fares structure mean?  The blacklist idea is a very good idea.  On the subject of housing, I started a petition to get my uni to provide lower cost housing as they are going to price out poorer students with their extortionate fees.  https://www.change.org/p/university-of-hertfordshire-professor-quintin-mckellar-andrew-may-provide-lower-cost-accommodation-for-students-who-live-on-campus-at-university-of-herts  Do you know of anyone in the Labour party who could help me with this?"

LabourUK,3d4ik9,TheQuipton,5,Fri Jul 17 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"Hi Christian, let me just start out with to say I love your policies and you're so far my favorite among candidates.  In the wake of the Conservative governments dropping zero carbon homes, it is clear we have the technology to build zero carbon homes. If elected what would you do in this area?  I was sold on your Oxford Street pedestrianising policy, but I think we must and can go further, what other areas streets do you got your eye on? Working in Soho I passionately believe we should pedestrianise there. If not possible we should at least restrict traffic to only apply to anyone who got business there. Soho should not be seen as a shortcut to get to somewhere else.  Finally while I recognise that your very good sustainable policies is good in our effort to tackle climate change, I would like us to see us going directly for tackling it as it is the most critical problem we face globally, also in London. We should draw up plans for generating more low-carbon electricity locally and aggressive tree planting projects."
LabourUK,3d4ik9,lets_chill_dude,3,Thu Jul 16 11:21:34 2015 UTC,Thank you for your support. I have always envisaged that Oxford Street would be a start of a process of 'greening' much of central London. I would work with the boroughs to gradually phase out unnecessary car traffic from as much of central London as possible.  I would ensure that new homes are built to high standards of insulation and I have also suggested a process of retrofitting older homes with better insulation targeting more deprived areas so people could save money on their bills.   I quite agree that the mayor of London should be a world leader in working to combat climate change.
LabourUK,3d4ik9,TheQuipton,4,Fri Jul 17 11:25:58 2015 UTC,"Hi Christian,  One question; It is interesting for a Labour candidate for London to suggest a Land Value Tax but however I feel a Land Value Tax would be better implemented by being part of party policy for the entire country and used to eliminate other taxes such as Council Tax, Business Rates, Stamp Duty, inheritance taxes and possibly more and also lower other taxes. What do you think?"
LabourUK,3d4ik9,lets_chill_dude,4,Fri Jul 17 10:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yes of course, but that is a matter for national government. The point I am trying to make is for the mayor to lobby to be allowed to change business rates to a Land Value Tax system in London,which may then be used as a trial for the rest of the country."

LabourUK,3d4ik9,motownphilly1,4,Mon Jul 13 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"CP is pretty close to Streatham. The tramlink extension would mostly take over a pretty isolated main line stretch that goes from Crystal Palace to Beckenham Junction, but by adding it to the tramlink it would be able to better connect to Croydon and Purley to the south which, with the developments happening there at the moment will bring benefits."

There are bus links (249 and 417, plus others within a short walk), rail (direct trains Streatham Hill to CP, or change at Tulse Hill), alternatively it's a longish walk (but some quite nice routes via local parks) or a short but decidedly hilly cycle ride."

The situation we have now is better than we once did, but it's still a monopoly, heavily censored provider in stations only.  Would you have TFL extend coverage into the tunnels? Open it up to competition? Do something about the mandatory censorship of content (Virgin block Reddit itself about every three months, and their filter cannot be disabled)?  Thank you."
LabourUK,3d4ik9,NotEtreo,4,Thu Jul 16 12:58:47 2015 UTC,"I think extending Tube wifi is a good idea, but it is more technically difficult (due to the tunnels) than commonly thought. I'm not sure what the finer details of Virgin's deal with TfL are, but it is worth looking into."

LabourUK,3d4ik9,britishchris,3,Fri Jul 17 11:49:42 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what your views are about big development and regeneration projects around London are? What would you do to ensure that big developments do offer something to the wider community?  For myself, I think some of the anti-development narrative has gone a bit too far, and is led in many parts by NIMBYs. We need to accept that London is global city with a growing population, and to be able to house people and provide world-class office space, we need lots of new buildings. In the economic era we are in, private development is realistically the only way we are going to achieve this, and for all its wrongs, without it we would not get anywhere near the amount of new builds required.  That said, there are issues around 'viability' assessments and the ways developers use s106 agreements and CIL payments to get around offering 'affordable' housing and yet still making massive profits. It seems that many local authorities are simply out of their depth when dealing with massive developments - how will you ensure that planning authorities have the power and ability to stand up for themselves in the face of big developers who use complicated financial processes to get around providing housing for normal Londoners?  An additional point - what do you think about 'affordable housing' as it is currently? Set at 80% of the market rate, this more often than not keeps the market rate rising and rising, meaning that even 80% of it is still 'unaffordable'."
LabourUK,3d4ik9,wulfhound,3,Fri Jul 17 08:24:24 2015 UTC,"Obviously they need to be looked at on a case by case basis.I am deeply sceptical about schemes that require the demolition of a lot of perfectly habitable social housing as is happening in several places such as Earls Court. I am also convinced that the viability assessments are being used by developers to reduce the amount of social housing in schemes completely unnecessarily. Councils often do not have the planning officers they need to counter these arguments and I would call in many more schemes than is currently the case - indeed, recent changes mean that schemes with 50 houses can now be called in rather than 150.  I have long criticised the notion that affordable housing can be 80 per cent of market rent - this is clearly completely wrong in London where market rents are so high and I would focus on providing genuinely affordable housing at 50 per cent or less."
LabourUK,3d4ik9,kdotdot,3,Fri Jul 17 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"Hello.  Two questions: 1) There have been a number of schemes related to the expansion of the Chiltern Railway within London, link here: Chiltern Railways. In particular, the Chiltern Metro and the Uxbridge High Street branch are quite interesting. Would you support those proposals? In the event of a third Heathrow runway, increased access from the north would only be a benefit.  2) Who would you support for Labour leader?"
LabourUK,3d4ik9,FromRussiaWithCash,2,Fri Jul 17 08:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, those are schemes I would support but I know there are issues about Chiltern favouring longer journeys rather than London suburban ones.

I am convinced,however, that a third runway will never happen and I have opposed it right from the start.  2) I am still listening to the debate and have not decided yet."

LabourUK,3d46j9,Kingy_who,9,Mon Jul 13 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Sent a fairly long email summarising my entire experience with UKIP on the doorstep, the area where I grew up had Labour completely eroded by UKIP voters and while campaigning there I gauged a lot of them were still pretty left-wing. The issue is Labour just isn't talking about immigration, and agree with them or not, immigration is a serious problem to a lot of working class (and middle-class too) people.

An interesting experience I had in life was moving from a largely white background to Bradford. Bradford itself is nothing unique in terms of cities with large numbers of immigrants, it simply has a lot of them. I am not a racist or xenophobe so this fact didn't bother me. My experience with so many different cultures was a huge novelty since I came from a predominantly white background and had literally only met a couple of different cultures in my life (but quite a few different races). My experience went like this:  At first it was great discovering different cultures from all over the world. It certainly was mind expanding and even fun. I had no problems with them the entire time I was living in Bradford (several years). However, once the novelty wore off the cracks started to show. These were not deliberate or malicious actions by immigrants, just unavoidable consequences of mass multiculturalism. Essentially the problem was it was difficult for us to relate to each other (not that we weren't doing it anyway), but for example things like humour (theirs may have been too brash, or British too subtle), or tastes in food or drink (things like sausage and mash was often seen as basic and unappealing). Leisure activities (eastern Europeans seem to have loud, raucous parties with lots of spirits, frequently), ways of life (at times I felt awkward doing typical British stuff because my immigrant friends would look on as if I was weird, not that they were rude about it).  Then there were practical problems, usually relating to the language barrier. Having to repeat myself numerous times, having to ask them to repeat themselves. And there is only so many times I can hear my name mispronounced before it starts to get annoying.  What at first was an exciting experience of multiculturalism became suffocating and isolating - despite being friends with plenty of immigrants right to the end of my time in Bradford, I was quite happy to get back to my home town. Although, at least I could do this, if my hometown became like Bradford I am not sure what I would do.  I have nothing against immigrants as people, and certainly don't deny their motives for being in Britain are reasonable. However, for the average English person (which I consider myself) mass multiculturalism (note: not all, just mass) is unappealing, and the threat, whether real or imagined, of it overriding/nullifying British values is a very scary prospect.

If you look at the statistics, we're taking in roughly 1/60 the British population every 3 years. Thats a number that is not financially or physically sustainable."
LabourUK,3d46j9,TrickyDickNixonbot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"Thats a number that is not financially or physically sustainable   What exactly is your rationale for this? In terms of physical space, The UK has a population density of 660 persons per square mile. Compare that with other successful, functioning developed nations like the Netherlands at 1,062, Israel at 961, Japan at 873 or south Korea at 1,261. We are not running out of space. Financially it's been shown over and over again that immigrants provide a net economic benefit, paying taxes and contributing to the economy, and claiming benefits less than native Brits.  What would be unsustainable would be a UK with a rapidly ageing population, where immigration is cut severely. With fewer immigrants, who tend to be young and productive and pay taxes, we would be forced to spend a greater and greater proportion of our GDP on health and social care for the elderly and on pensions."

This would improve economic growth and encourage job creation. It may involve spending money (which political leaders on both sides seem fucking allergic to) but it is something that Labour could make itself the champions of and get people thinking about, rather than pander to the right wing ideas on the topic. We need to be distinct from the other parties, and there's nothing wrong with a principled stand to support those without a voice, its where our movement comes from."

We've also decided pre-eminently opposing immigration is a 'right-wing' position, thereby granting the right all the support on this issue, and as the issue grows, our support lessens. I have no idea where you get this fanciful idea from that in the middle of a recovery when money is scarce and people are experiencing heavy cuts, that we are somehow obligated to build all this infrastructure and housing for people that dont even live here, and wouldn't live here if immigration controls were harder. Housing and infrastructure for the people already here, along with the welfare state, is our priority to sustain already.   The essence of this argument is literally 'we can build homes for people that come here, lets do that because we can because not doing it would be bad because reasons'. The question we should be asking is why are we supposed to be building all these homes for people who come here? This then brings us onto opposing immigration to begin with, because in a time of economic adjustment having low-skilled migration that companies will preferably hire to local British workers, combined with the fact that 300,000 people a year and growing is simply not remotely sustainable physically or financially, and would be incredibly expensive to continuously adjust to. Then there's the issue of cultural adjustment, where (although this is more arguable) enclaves are forming where adoption of British/Western values is not taking hold because of large numbers of foreigners conglomerating, and certain cultures are less compatible than others.   The whole idea of 'defending immigrants' seems to be something we're supposed to do for the sake of doing it. Not because there's any value in it, but just because. This is precisely whats losing us face."

That to me is fundamentally unfair.  I might agree with you if immigration were in the millions and there were huge masses at the gates. The fact is, there aren't. It is manageable.

Firstly i'd like to make it clear im a third generation immigrant, my family moved here from Malaysia in the 1960s. Secondly, this isnt about 'being British', everyone thats here already gets the same treatment, the problem is we're overcrowded in a time of shortage, economic adjustment and other social problems. To you over 300,000 a year and climbing may sound manageable, to most people and to every political party and politician and administrator, including Labour, its not manageable at all, and there is widespread public opposition to it. Although the principle of letting everyone come in sounds nice, its almost utopian, and unfortunately the reality is pretty grim. The longer we let it sit and deny it, the more and more the right-wing and the far-right will build and build, until you get a Sweden or France-style situation where parties like Front National and the Sweden Democrats wield scary amounts of influence preaching policies like 'hire white people first' and 'support Putin'."

I would hesitate to use terms like overcrowded...we can build enough houses for everyone and we aren't running out of resources or space just yet. The tricky thing is that with automation we will run out of low skilled jobs, but this is all the more reason to start working with people from other countries and not have a ""Britain first"" outlook. Dramatic changes don't respect national borders.  I think we should be strong enough to beat the right wing by staying on the ethical side of the issue, and not falling to their level.

A lot of them arn't even Labour - they are Greens, Socialist Workers, Communists etc and have paid £3 to be ""supporters"" and try influence the leadership election. It's entryism of the sort Lab last saw in the 1980's when Militant tried to seize control of the party structures*. (Other parties don't seem to have this problem - I don't know why we do - I think it's because Lab has a ""fluffy-softy"" image and these outsiders think they can manipulate us or use our brand for their own agenda like parasites).  *Regarding Militant, I don't know if the rest of Britain has even the slightest inkling of how hard Lab had to work to get rid of them. They would sign up as unemployed members (so very low subscription), pack the local CLP with their buddies and then try to set the agenda and votes their buddies into positions of control. Your average member then had to race home as soon as work finished and rush to get to the meetings to outvote them, and you couldn't miss a single one, no matter how tired or hungry you were, because if you didn't show up, you'd lose control of your branch. It was utterly exhausting, it went on for years, and the battle was fought throughout the party from the ground up through every single level.

I also read an article a while back which said that Attlee faced similar problems with the press (the Express called him Gestapo) - but what saved him was that the male half of the electorate were not at home reading the press, they were cut off, in barracks around the world, in Germany, Japan, Burma, North Africa. And they were the ones who voted him in. However when they demobbed and came home, they were influenced by the press again, and he lost in 1951.

I know that traditionally labour is for the working man but in my lifetime (I am in my 20s) Labour has not sincerely shown this virtue at all.  Generally speaking, for your interest, these days the right does not see Labour as a party that is for the benefit of the UK - quite the opposite - whether right or wrong, many right-wing people see Labour as a party with a hidden agenda. That being, tear down Britishness and instigate some form of communism. I know, this sounds bizarre, but trust me, this is (probably) just as bizarre to you as the Left's perceived view of the right is to us, which (i think) is: crush the little man and pay the rich, which is plain nonsense [bar some high powered conservatives]. The ""right"" has the general mentality that life is tough and you get what you work for. Work hard, stick up for each other, and we shall prevail. The right's consensus of the left's mentality is those who work hard are ""nazis"" who want to steal everyone's money and those who are unable to work hard (for whatever reason) are trodden on victims who need bottle feeding.  Important: my summary here is not necessarily precise of the ""right"", so please don't quote me, it is just a general description of what it feels like to be on the political right."
LabourUK,3d46j9,throwaway2951413,2,Tue Jul 14 01:15:59 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, for your interest, these days the right does not see Labour as a party that is for the benefit of the UK - quite the opposite   What did you think of New Labour? I thought the first ten years (1997 - 2007) really helped the whole of the UK. People did well, infrastructure got fixed.  When Lab came to power in 1997 NHS waiting lists were 2 years long and people were dying on them. When they left power, they were down to a mere six weeks (they've grown sharply again under the Conservatives). It probably doesn't seem important if you are in your 20's and good health - but as soon as you hit your thirties, you are having children, your body starts going wrong, and the service becomes important. And if you are elderly, you use it a lot.  Do you know how Lab got those lists down? Increased capacity. We built, equiped and staffed 149 new hospitals, plus modernised existing hospitals to take new equipment- you wouldn't believe how hard it was to modernise old hospitals like Guys - they were built in pre electric/pre cable times, it was a structural nightmare. Increased capacity meant people didn't need to wait. And if that capacity hadn't been increased, we would be in real trouble right now - waiting lists would be up to three or four years and people would be taking out insurance.  We think the whole of Britain benefited from what we did in the NHS. But how do people like you see it? Do you think we shouldn't have bothered to increase capacity? After all it cost money. Would you have let the service die and gone for insurance instead?  What I'm trying to get at is that the money that was spent wasn't spent on benefits. Unemployment was unusually low for most of Labour's period of office - it was usually about 4%, whereas during the Thatcher-Major years it was around 8%, they spent more helping the out-of-work than Blair did. Wages were good too - the whole zero hours thing didn't become widespread till the coalition took power. When people are in work and earning well, benefits arn't really required. We did spend money - but it was spent on hospitals. 149 of them."
LabourUK,3d46j9,aenor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:30:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know about the impact New Labour has had on the NHS. I have honestly never been sick enough to need to go to a hospital in my life (I am lucky, I guess). What you say does sound excellent, I will not deny that.  However, my personal grievance with labour is primarily their abolishment of grammar schools in favour of comprehensive schools. At risk of blowing my own trumpet, in school I was not an idiot, I was for the most part at the top of my class. So when I was still being taught solids, liquids and gasses in year 8, when I had already memorized and understood the periodic table by year 5 (I admit I have since forgotten it, possibly proving my point) and learned the basics of nuclear energy by year 7, and having to wait to be educated for teachers explaining basic arithmetic to people who simply didn't care, I lost hope that the education system would maximize my potential.  For my A-levels I started to re-learn what I had forgotten by year 9.  My point here is, whilst Labour (or New Labour, I don't know) emphasize helping the underdog, they completely neglect those at the other end of the spectrum which, believe it or not, need just as much help in their young age, just a different kind of help. My life during and after school degraded. I became jaded and angry and then depressed... I felt betrayed. Nowadays I am in a moderately good position, but I had to claw my way up from the repercussions of an ineffective schooling system that ignored my efforts.  Referencing my previous point, my efforts to work hard were rewarded with total disregard and those who couldn't be bothered were spoon fed. I feel that my optimistic childhood was shat on, frankly. And it's not much different in life nowadays.  I don't doubt that the Conservatives played a part in this somewhere, but fundamentally the Labour ideology of ""everyone is equal"" has only been a detriment to my life."
LabourUK,3d46j9,throwaway2951413,2,Tue Jul 14 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"Regarding the grammar schools. A bit of history - I feel like a wise old owl today imparting stuff that you young 'uns don't know :-)  This will come as a complete shock to you, but grammar schools were introduced by Attlee's government, and he in turn was following a report by Beveridge done in the middle of the war (yes, in the middle of all the bombs there were people beavering away working on the future).  They came under attack immediately. You see, to enter the grammar, you needed to pass the 11-plus. And lots of middle class people found that their little darlings were failing the exams, and their places were being taken by dreadful oiks from the working classes!   To make things worse, the secondary moderns (which is where the 90% who failed their 11-plus went) were shite squared. They didn't bother to teach anything academic, or anything useful at all. They were still turning out hand carpenters in the 1960's when machine-processed wood had taken over industry a whole fifty years earlier. It wasn't a big problem in the 1950's when low-skill jobs were aplenty, but in an era of automation, turning out children like that is to doom them to poverty.  Then there was the problem that some children matured later than others. So if you came into your own at 12 instead of 11, and hadn't done well at your 11-plus, that was your life utterly ruined. You were destined for a grotty factory job or down the mine even if you had the capacity to become a scientist.  In other words, the grammars worked like a dream for the 10% who got in, but didn't work for the 90% who didn't. And govts have to consider the 90%...  The first comprehensives were introduced under Macmillan in the early 1960's, to fix what they thought of as Attlee's mistakes. They were supposed to solve the problem of the 11-year old cut-off, and solve the problem of 10% getting a good education and 90% getting rubbish. Put everyone into one school, stream the classes (very important) and then if a child improved, you moved them up a stream. Your school should have had streaming, so you didn't need to sit with the slow ones, you should have been in the top stream. A side effect if you were middle class, was that the school depended on where you lived - so unlike in the grammars where all the social classes mixed, if you lived in a nice neighbourhood you didn't have to mix with the oiks.  Then there was a problem with the teachers. Some of them were complete and utter lazy-arses. How do you deal with that. Well ""control-freak"" New Labour dealt with it by having lots of exams and lots of inspections. Exams at age 7, 9, 11 etc etc, and the local authority can look at teh stats, spot the outlying schools which were underperforming, and send in the inspectors. Teachers hated it of course (and the SNP in Scotland have abolished the whole exams and inspection regime and seen outcomes drop).  I'm not sure you realise this, but local authorities have the power to bring back grammars if they want, and the county of Kent still has it's grammars and secondary moderns. However, you'll find that most authorities (tory, lab, LibDem) haven't gone down that route because of the problems I've out-lined. And in Kent, the kids who go to secondary modern (i.e. 90% of the kids) are underperforming those in comprehensives. And there shouldn't be much difference because we're dealing with the vast majority here.  The answer to the problem you faced in school would be enforcing streaming and challenging schools that don't offer it.   Also - and this is an unpopular thing to say - outcomes in schools are correlated with parental involvement. Are they making their child do their homework. Are they volunteering to sit on the school board. Because schools are much like small businesses - they all have sub-cultures develop and the people best placed to watch that are the parents. It's hard for an education minister to micromanage the education of some 10 million kids. But sadly parents can't be arsed to volunteer, and teachers don't like to be inspected.   The reason old school people like myself are worried about the free-school thing the Conservatives are pushing is because it takes them outside the control of inspectors and the local authority, they don't even need to hire teachers of minimum standards. Hard experience suggests that if you don't watch them like hawks and enforce standards, they slack and produce poor results - but I guess that's my Labour control-freakery coming out!  Given your enthusiasm for grammars, how would you fix the problems I outlined? Perhaps you have ideas we've not thought of, in which case, please speak up so we can pinch them! :-)"
LabourUK,3d46j9,aenor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"Good answer, although I am a little bit ""ting poddily"" this moment to fully study it (I will later). I will briefly say these thoughts, though.  It is my understanding that ""if you fail the 11+ you are doomed"" is myth, and that it was possible that if you excelled in a secondary modern you could be ""promoted"" to a grammar school, or something to that effect.  Also, crushing the ambitions of that 10% to appease the other 90% is not moral, regardless of the reasons behind it. Besides the obvious consequence that you chastise the nation of that 10% of very useful people (didn't these people originally maneuver  Britain into world leader it is today? plus that 90% working in ""grotty factories and mines"" who built it?).  Perhaps a lack of secondary moderns teaching vocational subjects is partly why this country has no industry nowadays (aside from thatcher etc.)?  My grampa left school at 15 with bugger all qualifications, but he was clever. Through hard work and applying himself ""in a grotty factory"" (a cotton mill specifically) he became the became a mill [engineering] manager, so you point there is definitely not entirely accurate.  What are people like myself supposed to do? Squander our abilities? If I didn't force myself to work extra hard (which was a depressing and painful process) I would have easily gone down the route of idle druggy, which was truthfully a high risk possibility for myself had I not ""pulled myself together"".  These are some thoughts but I am a bit too ""out of it"" this moment to think deeper...  A final point I just remembered, for all you promote the superiority of modern schooling, I stand by my life experience. Modern comprehensives are shit at doing the one thing they are there for: teaching. [my school, according to ofsted, was allegedly a ""Good"" school]"
LabourUK,3d46j9,throwaway2951413,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"People were rarely able to move from a secondary modern to a grammar after age 11. Consider: you are in a shitty secondary modern, and you then lose an entire year of academic education. No-one would even discover that you have matured and no-one would help you catch up - so how could you join the grammar at age 12?  Regarding your grampa - people were able to work their way up back in the day. It's impossible now - you are judged by your cv and if it doesn't have the quals, you don't even get an interview.  I suppose one solution to the problem you describe would be hot-housing. Say in an area of about 500,000 people (so two small towns), you could set up a hothouse school and send the particularly bright kids there. So one hothouse and the rest normal comps. But that kinds of thing needs local authority control over all the schools in the area.   If you have free-schools opting out, and various schools doing their own thing, you don't get enough pupils to make the hothouse school viable. If it's not viable, it won't happen (council tax restrictions, the money the tax can go up is capped and grants from central govt have been cut, which means money for schools is cut).  In theory a group of parents could set up their own hothouse school using the Conservatives free-school thing, which is funded directly by the dept of education. But none have - all the free-schools seem to be done by religious nutters, or people wanting to make a fast buck - so take the money, then skimp by hiring people who don't even have teaching certificates, and profit.  So to make it work, we'd need to put the local authority back in charge. But that's not popular - everyone wants to do their own thing.  Here's the downside of democracy: the 10% will always get outvoted by the 90% and middle classes (who are the main people who vote) will always outvote the working classes who tend not to bother. Those simple facts drive everything."

However, I would say this, say if 5% of that 90% incorrectly missed out on being in a grammar school back then, how does this compete to 100% of that 10% missing out on grammar schools nowadays?  Factories these days generally [still] don't care for a comprehensive CV and solid qualifications, and certainly don't deny promotions... although the process may be harder. Although, I appreciate you weren't necessarily talking specifically about factories.  Hot-housing is a new term for me, I will have to research this, it sounds very interesting.  Cheers for interesting things to think about."

UKIP is a movement which listens to people and talks to people without buzzwords.  We need to reconnect with Labour voters who have moved to UKIP by getting back into their life.  Don't think most people who are thinking of voting UKIP have done it due to policy on EU or immigration.   Loads of UKIP voters are non voters who left the system but came back due to UKIP. Amazing thing is UKIP are pretty light on the ground but media wise they are pretty good.   When it comes to immigration we should do more when taking people in and look outwards more.  Does mean people learning at school French or German.

LabourUK,3d4f0y,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Mon Jul 13 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"Here's the text:   I have always said to my party that we cannot be too complacent. There is a lot to be done. We have come such a long way. We are going to go further together because it is right. No one, least of all me, ever thought that it would be easy getting from where we are to where we need to be.  I will say this to you, and I say it right from the bottom of my heart, when I have taken decisions in the Labour party that I believe are necessary to put this party in the position where it can win an election, it is not because I want to turn my back on the beliefs of the Labour party – in social justice, in ridding this country of poverty, in dealing with the stigma of homelessness – it is because I know that if we cannot get a Labour government then we can do nothing for the poor and the unemployed and the homeless.  Of course it is hard. Of course there is frustration building up [sic] this country. There is anger. There is outrage at what has happened. But outrage and anger are not enough. We have to be the means of translating that anger and that passion into the achievement of a change of government. I sit there in the House of Commons, I have ever since 1983, sitting there opposite me people doing things – the poll tax, the benefits cuts, the privatisation of decent public health services, what has happened in the health service, in our educations service – I have sat there and I have watched these people ruin our country, ruin it. I sit there opposite Michael Heseltine, Michael Howard, Virginia Bottomley, Peter Lilley, John Redwood…and those are the good ones! I have sat there and I have watched them.  In my own mind, I have complete confidence in the beliefs I hold dear. I know why I am in the Labour party, I know why I am part of it. I know why I have joined this party and worked for it for the last 20 years. It is because when you look around your society you see the injustice, you see the opportunity denied, you see the unfairness, you see all that elitism at the top, you see that establishment still there trying to run parts of our country, and you look around even beyond our country and you see a world which has plenty and yet is torn by starvation and war.  There are still great causes to unite decent people. There are still great fights and struggles to be won out there. But what has come home to me more than anything else is the utter futility of Opposition. I did not join the Labour party to join a party of protest. I joined it as a party of government and I will make sure that it is a party of government.  Do not let anyone ever forget that it is power for a purpose. It is power to put into place that programme for the long-term unemployed. It is power to give people a decent agenda of rights at [sic] the workplace. It is power to change our education system, to stop the privatisation of health, to build a better, more secure industrial future for this country. It is power for that purpose.  I tell you, look around at these Tories today they would not understand decency, respect and integrity if it came up and bit them in the leg. These are the people who have been running our country, and no longer should they be running our country, not in any decent society. Therefore, when I say to you, New Labour – and I do without apology and without hesitation – I do it because I know. That man there, Neil Kinnock [who was also on the platform that day], he struggled and in that brilliant way he brought this party back from where it was, practically dead, in 1983. Remember it. That is where we were. Do not ever forget, because he will not, every inch of the way: ‘you should not do it’, ‘it is going too far’, ‘it is the wrong thing’, ‘it is all being run by a tiny elite at the top’, all the rest of it. But we had to do it. We had to do it because of our concern for people who are poor and unemployed and homeless and at the injustice in our society. Then John Smith had to do it. I have to do it too. I do it because I believe. I do it because the society I want to create is not some fantasy or dream. It could be true. But it can only be true if we have the guts, the decency, the discipline and the honesty to tell it to those people out there like it is, not to make promises we cannot keep, to deliver on the promises we make, and to rebuild this country as a great nation again.  Yes, it is tough. Yes, it is tough, but, yes, we are going to do it. Those Tories who think they have a divine right to rule, not now, not today, not in this Labour party, not under this leader. New Labour. New Britain. Let us get on with it.   Obviously he didn't live up to all of that but it's a cracking speech."

A lot of the ideas proposed here fall under that category, but until the leaders campaigning actually sit down and consider what we are, none of them will make it onto the policy platform. Not Burnham, not Kendall, not Cooper, not Corbyn provide anything radically new, and that's disappointing. Some stuff not on here im fond of:   Stakeholder grants, giving every adult 8000£ upon reaching age 18 to purchase shares on the stock market, creating a stakeholding society. Corporate social responsibility mandates. India has a system where all corporations are required to spend 2% of their profits on socially responsible programs like charity and community work.

LabourUK,3d485z,Zephine,5,Mon Jul 13 11:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, thought she would. I made a comment on another thread explaining why I thought Harman had taken this stance, some of which Kendall covers here:   People said to us: 'We don’t trust you on the money, we don’t trust you on welfare reform'. If we are going to oppose things we have to put something else in its place because if we carry on making the same arguments we have done over the last five years we will get the same result. [My emphasis.]   I've highlighted the point I also made earlier, here, which is that we need a different approach to welfare and doing that involves first accepting the terms of the debate.  If we simply say, 'No, we're not going to cut welfare', people switch off before we get as far as explaining why.  If we say 'Yes, we are going to change that because it doesn't work', then people might actually listen to the next bit."
LabourUK,3d485z,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon Jul 13 13:22:43 2015 UTC,"But is this really saying that?  It seems to me as if it's saying ‘yes, the Tories are right on this point’.  Even if that wasn't what Harriet intended to say, and I honestly haven't heard anything to say that there's this ingenious tactical ruse up her sleeve as you suggest, then it is most emphatically not how it has been seen by vast swathes of the party.  It works both ways.  Harriet said ‘yes, we're going to cut welfare’.  A very large number of people have just switched off.  And I see no explanation as to why.  And, honestly, before we go out and try to convince the electorate we deserve government, we need to convince ourselves.  Otherwise we're going to be too busy infighting and half-arsing and going to the papers to try and bury each other to get any message across.  And, as you can patently see, this has set the party at its own throat before we even have a new leader."

The Fabian Society found that our clearest route to power involves 80% of our new votes coming from the Tories. So, yes, we have to sound like the Tories. We have to address the concerns of Tory voters, including on welfare, otherwise, we will not win.  We cannot stop the Tories from cutting tax credits. What we can do is concede the point to show that we do share people's concerns about welfare. That can help us win. When we win, we can change the welfare system. Then we say, 'Look, we addressed your concerns. We made reforms. We also put more money into it than the Tories, to help people who really need it, because children and disabled people don't deserve to suffer'.  If we do what we're currently doing, and say, 'No, it's fine, cutting it is bad', it gets cut anyway and we keep losing elections."

Austerity has torn this country apart and Labour need to fill the shoes of the party that will oppose that. I mean, we built the NHS off the crippling deficit of WW2, and now we're jumping ship because of some relatively arbitrary global financial troubles? Austerity should be an absolute last resort, Labour need to prioritize policies that will re-distribute the wealth and stimulate consumer expenditure in the lower classes, allowing for them to have a comfortable quality of life and to be able to spend money on goods and services, not leech of our welfare system.  What this government fails to understand is that the working class are the real job creators, not the billionaire class. Where there are financially comfortable consumers, there is growth and profit potential. Instead, they think that giving tax cuts to billionaires will encourage them to create more jobs rather than buy that extra holiday home in Spain they've been eyeing up. Liz is bringing this dangerous mantra to the Labour party and it should ultimately end badly for her."
LabourUK,3d485z,AnxiousMo-Fo,7,Mon Jul 13 13:39:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you actually understand what I just wrote or what Liz Kendall said.  Here's what I think:   People think the welfare system doesn't work We say, 'Yup, you're right, which is why we back these changes, but ultimately the Tories can't fix it. We can'. People start to trust us on this issue and vote for us We fix it so that it defends the people it needs to defend   Here's what you seem to think:   People think the welfare system doesn't work But it does work! Stupid people! Unrelated complaint about the 'billionnaire class' We get elected for some reason   I'm sure Liz won't mind me speaking for her, here: You, me and Liz Kendall have something in common: We want a strong welfare system. Where we seem to disagree is on whether we want this system.  But let's think about this: You seem pretty left-wing. Do you want a system where some people (yes, a minority) end up stuck on welfare, unable to motivate themselves or get the qualifications they need to work? Do you want workfare to exist? Do you want evil work capability assessments? I suspect not. You want to change it. We all agree we need to change it: You, me, Liz, the Tories, the people. We just disagree about how.  So, we all want a different system. But then, for some reason, lots of people on the left have boxed themselves into defending this system which they just agreed doesn't work. And then when I point out that it doesn't work, people start yelling at me about second homes in Spain and the average person says 'What the fuck does this have to do with welfare? Why did I tune into Question Time to listen to this? I just want my son, who's on JSA, to be able to get a real job and for those [imaginary] spongers to not take the piss anymore, and instead I'm listening to this guy say ""stimulate consumer expenditure"". What's on ITV?'  Do you see the problem with this?"
LabourUK,3d485z,AnxiousMo-Fo,0,Mon Jul 13 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but in my opinion, this type of mentality is holding Labour back.  Everything has become about compromise. Compromise welfare, compromise tax cuts, compromise the NHS. The conservatives have become the 'sensible' intellectuals and we're becoming the party that tags along agreeing with everything they say but then tweaking it a little to slightly appeal to the left wing.  Your logic, from what I've gathered, is that threat of absolute poverty should be a motivator to get people into work. I don't agree with this, for several reasons. We're an advanced first world country, and should be able to take care of everyone. We have a billionaire class which is avoiding tax, which we need to chase before any sort of cuts are applied to our welfare system. No one should go homeless or living in absolute poverty just because they can't find a job. Most of my ideas stem from universal basic income concept.  You've also bought into the idea that most people on JSA are lazy teens who can't be arsed to get a job. That's a small minority. There are thousands of extremely qualified people who are being asked to work as retail assistants and understandably don't want to. This is why we need to stimulate spending in the working class, to encourage corporations to hire more skilled labour, taking these qualified people off the welfare system and into the contributing workforce.   The majority of people don't have the attention span of a spoon, as you so eloquently illustrated with your 'average question time viewer monologue'. We need to say what needs to be said. Labour needs to bring the solution to the forefront of the debate, not succumb to the ""harsh truths"" mantra the Tories keep forcing down our throats."

If necessary, I'm happy to tweak Labour policies so they appeal to the right wing, but I'd much prefer to devise new policies altogether. And, yes, where we can steal popular Tory policies and fit them into our narrative and our values, I say we steal them.   Your logic, from what I've gathered, is that threat of absolute poverty should be a motivator to get people into work   I don't know how you gathered that.

You've also bought into the idea that most people on JSA are lazy teens who can't be arsed to get a job. That's a small minority.   I'm not going to check, but I'm fairly sure the words 'a small minority' appeared in my post above in reference to this exact thing. Again, you may want to re-read what I actually said. I certainly don't believe that many people on JSA are lazy or that all of them are teens, and in the case of the ones that are either or both, I don't believe that's why they can't get a job.

All the while alienating our entire left wing and sending them to the Green party/Lib Dems etc. We made this mistake last election, are we really going to make the same mistake again? sigh   The majority of people in the UK voted for a right wing party at the last election. We didn't really lose any votes to the Lib Dems. You're also making a common fallacy, which is that we could simply get a more votes if we moved left a little bit. However, if we did this, we would also lose votes to the right. You know, like we did in the last election.   Well you are supporting the cuts, living on benefits is hard enough as it is, it's going to get a hell of a lot tougher with the new reforms   You seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that we can stop these cuts today. We can't. Opposing or supporting them now makes absolutely no difference to whether or not they happen. What we can do is try and get elected in five years, at which point, we will be able to make a difference.   This is exactly whats wrong with politics, it's become a soundbite fest where everyone squanders over what policy sounds the best without actually creating a policy that works.   Please, give me an economics lecture that changes all that forever.   Here's a better way to present it to the public. ""Our finances are broken, we need a better system to be able to pay for our welfare state, therefore we need to do X Y and Z to pay for welfare.""    The public do not want to pay for welfare. Any sentence ending 'to pay for welfare' will fall on deaf ears, especially if it's proceeded, in any way, by the words 'tax' and 'more'.   It's not changing the subject, its economics.   It is changing the subject. David Cameron doesn't hand people a book he wrote when they ask him about welfare. He doesn't dispute the premise. He doesn't start talking about something else. He just answers the fucking question.   ""There is not enough money to pay for our essential welfare system, we must generate money from elsewhere, we are starting with going after the billionaire tax evaders that aren't paying their way and contributing to our struggling finances""   Thank you for rephrasing what I said in a way that is slightly more realistic, and no less ridiculous, than my original phrasing. When someone replies, 'Yes, there isn't enough money and our finances are struggling because of Labour's overspending', will you finally answer their original question about how you're going to stop people sponging off the welfare system, or will you give them another economics lecture?"
LabourUK,3d485z,Number-6,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"Remember Blair's incredibly popular New Deal program, that program that actually innovated with welfare delivery and ended up being successful in reducing unemployment, poverty and people on welfare? Yeah, thats what we need to be doing. But nope, gotta just have a huge spendy spend welfare state in the era of globalisation because thats what we did in 1945 before globalisation, computers and modern Techno-Capitalism existed."
LabourUK,3d3r0f,JohnJoBiggins,4,Mon Jul 13 07:45:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're thinking about this wrong. Cameron and Osbourne's pledge to match Labour on spending did nothing to harm their reputation for economic credibility (and nor did their u-turn on it) but, at the time, it helped with their 'compassionate Conservative' brand. Harman's trying a similar trick, here: She knows Labour won't simply adopt the Tories' welfare policies wholesale, in Opposition or in Government, but she's trying to build a brand that says 'We're economically sensible; we're willing to make tough decisions; we're not the ""party of benefits""'.  Frankly, if we're smart about it, there's plenty of ways we could absorb and 'support' these plans, while quietly preparing a raft of new measures that either a) mitigate against the worst aspects and/or b) turn the debate around completely, with bonus option c) quietly stop supporting them later. Before we can do that, we first have to accept the terms of the debate, which is what Harman's doing here."
LabourUK,3d3r0f,AnxiousMo-Fo,4,Mon Jul 13 10:18:38 2015 UTC,"It's a risky strategy though. The danger is that it doesn't get forgotten further down the line. The Tories benefit from having a sympathetic press, so their spending pledges get swept under the carpet. If Labour back the Tories now, but try and use welfare cuts against them later on you can bet the farm on it getting dragged up in 5 years."
LabourUK,3d3r0f,sosr,3,Mon Jul 13 11:35:46 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but bear in mind that that same unsympathetic press also calls for benefits to be cut quite regularly. They can hardly criticise us for saying we're going to do what they want, so we'll get the positive buzz now and later... Well, they'll be attacking us anyway, and 'Labour u-turn on something their acting leader mentioned, once, five years ago' is a much less effective attack than 'Same old Labour refuse to rule out benefits cuts, just like they've been doing for the last 10 years'.  In any case, I think the assumption is that no government is going to leave the benefits system as is, so we can expect some kind of Labour reform which doesn't, strictly speaking, reverse the current Conservative policy, but rather does the whole thing differently."
LabourUK,3d3r0f,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon Jul 13 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty ridiculous that Harman wouldn't at least ring round and gauge the views of the 4 candidates on this sort of thing in advance. I get that she's trying to be an activist leader and not just a caretaker, and I'm broadly thrilled with that, but she mustn't forget that she did not put her name forward for leader herself and one of those 4 candidates will be the one leading us into 2020.  Edit: Spelling. Gauge the dials, not gage the plums."

And then when EdM became leader, he announced ""committees"" to look at everything for another two years (and then ignored the results) which meant more time wasted and more time for the Tories to define Labour.  I think Harriet has decided to do things differently this time, and more power to her elbow."

However, I do fear she may do ""a Harman"" and effectively refuse to oppose the Tories on some issues for the fear of being seen as uncooperative. That isn't really being a ""Red Tory"" per se, but it does come across as extremely odd. Labour lost the election but that does not mean they have no right to oppose the Tories on many issues.

Not sure if that sentiment is exactly why people stuck around (or maybe just inertia?), but it goes a way to explaining it.

Millitant were never a real threat to the Labour party, the right just painted them as this because Benn was inculuding them in debate. Trotskyists would never have taken control of the party even with Benn as leader.   TUSC only got 30k-ish votes at the last election, and they've been the first attempt to unify the opposing left-of-Labour socialists into one party.   If the left had truly left Labour, lefties would've stopped votingLabour altogether, which some of them did, but most of them didn't.  What you've basically said is that there was no left-wing of Labour during the Blair years, which is utter bollocks. Even under Miliband Labour were expelling councillors for voting against cuts, but there's still a left of the party.  To ignore them and their views is not what Labour's about at all, too many people on the right think the left should vote and not be heard, simply because we're not the Tories, as Scotland proved, that attitude has a sell by date."

Few people have any faith that Corbyn can do the same. Even some of Corbyn's supporters don't think he'll win elections (see: half the arguments on this sub).  Naturally, there was also a contingent who didn't like Blair, didn't think it was worth 'selling out' (or whatever) to win, but stuck with Labour because they didn't want to split the left."

You get the feeling that he wants rid of austerity not just because it goes against his convictions, but also because to him it is a failed model compared to that of investment.

Yes, his views are at face value utterly misaligned with the electorate personally I think that's a marketing problem at least as much as an ideological one, and confounded a bit by several factors that have nothing to do with ideology, but in the absence of rigorous impartial analysis it's hard to say.  Yes, his views just so happen to be the sort of views we heard Foot say in the 80s democracy dates back to several centuries BC, clearly that's irrelevant to today's politics!  Yes, he's old so is the Queen, often noted for her astuteness and he's an outsider aren't many people sick of seeing the political elite by now? and he likes causes generally considered to be a bit unsympathetic honestly I don't have a response to this, I need to look it up a bit more to say the least.  But he's different.  He isn't prepared to make Labour kneel down and beg forgiveness instead of picking itself up and going forwards.  He isn't immediately saying yes, we'll have this cut, yes, we'll have this one, as if austerity is the only way forwards and just because the Tories set the agenda once means they can keep setting it.  We do need a little compromise and realism and maybe Jeremy isn't quite giving us that.  But for me it's him or it's a leader who almost seems to want the Tories to keep writing the agenda, who doesn't want to challenge the neoliberal consensus and austerity, who doesn't want to at least engage the electorate in a discussion about how this country might be better off with change.  IMO, we need to stop this.  Right now.  Before we don't have a point any more, before we might as well be the left wing of the Tories.  Maybe it's even too late."

LabourUK,3d042q,Kalissss,2,Sun Jul 12 13:03:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think Hunt is completely right on what Labour needs to do, and is too involved with the internals of the party.  The problem with the Labour Party right now is how it has associated media portrayal too closely with electoral success. Granted some consciousness of what the media is saying matters, but Labour has got too involved with this in the wrong way, as if they seek to manipulate what the media is saying.  It has avoided confronting the agenda set out by the Tories and the perception is that they are avoiding the topic of the deficit because they know that the Tories are right - this is why they are in trouble. People don't know why Labour is not defending itself or it's record.  Labour has also since failed to defend any of the positives of Gordon Brown's/Tony Blair's time as PM and still seems to be doing so as much as they can to avoid the deficit question - the fact John Prescott mentioning something positive was almost headline news confirms this. In turn they also failed to defend Miliband whilst the media was attacking him, instead opting to question whether another leader was better, reinforcing in the public that their leader was not suitable to run the country.  Along with this has been a desire to emulate Blair amongst all potential leadership candidates. This approach is making the problems worse, the public face of the party has no real character as nobody dares to say anything that could be a negative headline quote.   This all makes the party no different to the Conservatives - why would anyone have confidence in a soulless party that can't even tell you what positives they have achieved and would achieve if you voted for them? Labour is placing too much on the party leader and less on the actual party.   When you offset this against what the Tories are offering right now - People can actually name various members of the Conservative cabinet, they even had two former leaders of the opposition involved. Would Labour be able to do this in power? I have doubts.  If Corbyn is capable of listening to other perspectives that differ to his, as a leader rather than a pseudo-celebrity, he honestly could be the only opportunity to break the trend Labour are establishing that is cementing their fate. Labour needs to be more than just a party saying 'we are not Tories'.   I would be interested in seeing the various leadership candidates draw up who they would have in their shadow cabinet and why."

I'm looking forward to watching more of her videos when they come out over the next week (Liz has declined for now).  It should be said though that I felt Burnham was often a bit bland, in-passionate, unconvincing and generic, characteristics of his ever repeated ""Westminster bubble"". His response to the question about his difference to Cooper (he's got more ""conviction""), his generic response about civic-nationalism being unpleasant & divisive, his lack of ability to suggest changes to the party and himself not having any particular stance on being different to Ed Miliband.

I think JC will come 3rd or a close 2nd. It all depends on who drops out first. If LK drops out first, I suspect her 2nd prefs will go to Cooper, which will then get her ahead of Corbyn but lose to Burnham. If Yvette loses first, I think more of her 2nd prefs will go to Burnham so Liz will get knocked out in 3rd and Corbyn will get 2nd.  In terms of personal anecdotes: My mum lives in a rural constituency, my dad in a city marginal. My mum's CLP nommed Corbyn but meetings are very poorly attended and the chair used to be in Militant. Out of 55k new members, said CLP only had 78 since the election. I know a few of these new members, none of them went to the meeting but none of them are voting for Corbyn and all are putting him 4th.  My Dad is in a fairly marginal seat that nommed Cooper. Corbyn went out in the first round in a packed meeting, followed by LK, then AB. Yet again, I'm quite good friends with a fair few Labour people around here, and very few who didn't go to the meeting are voting Corbyn.  Therefore, I think the CLP nominations are a bit misleading. Burnham is still the clear favourite in this contest (and not everyone who signed up as a supporter is voting for Corbyn)."

I think we should raise the minimum wage across the board, and peg it to inflation. I think we should reverse all of Gove's educational programs and halt the entire free school crusade, and bring back the old state school system in force. I think we should increase military spending and soldiers' pay, pensions and benefits, rather than totally neglect the standing army and its provisions/equipment. I think we should work towards bringing in worker representation on company boards ala the European model. I think we should be creating targeted investment where we can while working within our means, by this I mean not breaking from the balanced budget but subsidising manufacturing and technology. I think we should expand the Space Agency again. I think we should eventually take the rails back into public ownership when it becomes fiscally feasible (reincorporation is an incredibly costly process). I think we should oppose welfare and public sector pay freezes. I think we should look at the government purchasing shares in major British companies. I think we should create more support for workers' cooperatives and profit-sharing schemes within companies. I think we should work towards a European exit in favour of a closer economic and military alliance with the United States/and or Canada, New Zealand and Australia. I think we should be more heavy-handed when dealing with overseas tyranny, and more willing to intervene for stabilisation like we did in Sierra Leone. I think we should not be cutting anything from the foreign aid budget. I think we should be investing in green energy in a similar manner to the Germans, as well as sponsoring cyclical economic schemes like the Dutch.  The list goes on and on, and most of Europe are embarking on programs like this while remaining with austerity limits, because austerity isn't this grand black/white elephant in the room.

Liz Kendall: Also did a good job of answering the question put to her rather than the one in her head, much better than last time, and better than the other two candidates. I get the feeling she's less experienced at public speaking than the others, hence her tendency to run on. Despite that, I think she made her case very clearly. I don't think she's trying to reframe the debate in order to attack the other candidates; she genuinely believes that being electable is the most important thing. Andy Burnham: Very passionate, dedicated, heart is clearly in the right place. Unfortunately his answers lacked substance and often didn't address the question fully. It's a shame that he didn't come across well (at least to me) in front of just about the friendliest audience possible. I think he's a great spokesman for the party but not the leader we need. (All that said, I did like his proposal to formally combine health and social care into a single body). Yvette Cooper: I'm having tremendous difficulty summoning an opinion on her. Sorry. That probably says enough in itself.   I missed the deputy leader's questions as I went to meeting/debate with Liz Kendall. Is there any way to watch those online or read the minutes? I'll probably vote for Tom Watson anyway, if only for the inevitable Tom and Jerry jokes if Jeremy Corbyn also wins ;)  You can probably tell where my allegiances lie, based on that. I have tried to be fair to the other candidates, for what it's worth."

LabourUK,3csh6c,TrickyDickNixonbot,6,Fri Jul 10 12:17:31 2015 UTC,It's really hard to spin it and convince the public it's fair. I totally agree with Basic Income but we need spin to make it not look like a free pass to mooch off the state or giving money to rich people.   https://youtu.be/MkM1KAQkzsU has a few points we could use.
LabourUK,3csh6c,Kingy_who,2,Fri Jul 10 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm a little bit...sketchy...about the whole basic income thing. I know it's a bit of a Reddit favourite, but I'm hazy on the details.  For a start, it sounds expensive. Assuming that the Basic Income has to be enough to live on, and assuming we already have a welfare state that provides (something close to) a liveable income for those who require, wouldn't extending a basic income to millions more people (who don't currently need welfare at all) amount to a massive hike in benefits bill.  Can you give me some pointers about how it's all supposed to work?"
LabourUK,3csh6c,Patch86UK,3,Fri Jul 10 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with it is that it requires massive reform of many areas, we would need a complete reform of the tax system so it works like a negative income tax, we would probably need to get rid of minimum wage (It would probably incentivise low wage workers to fight for working conditions rather than pay). You would probably need to make reforms to adult education."
LabourUK,3csh6c,Kingy_who,5,Fri Jul 10 16:41:57 2015 UTC,"Nice tag. :) I know this was made by a Green Member, but the costing could still be applied here. There are plenty of benefits of a /r/basicincome, and it would be defiantly worth something advocating for. It's a fresh idea which might be able to spark some interest back into the Labour Party."
LabourUK,3csh6c,Ajnin123,2,Fri Jul 10 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"I've read the first link, and I'm still not exactly convinced. So it's the equivalent of putting the entire 18+ working population on JSA, and at the same time abolishing the minimum wage- how is that not just a massive taxpayer subsidy for businesses to get away with paying their most vulnerable staff peanuts? You'd be looking at a transfer of wealth on the scale of thousands of pounds per employee from the taxman to Tesco each year; swell...  Edit: Going to expand on the minimum wage point, as I find that quite infuriating. The proposed Basic Income is about one quarter of the UK Living Wage. Currently, the National Minimum Wage plus the proposed Basic Income would pretty much put you exactly on the Living Wage (30p per hour over on a 40 hour week, to be precise). And they want to abolish the minimum wage- meaning that most minimum wage workers will be below a living wage after this plan were implemented, perhaps even more than currently. So the Greens' version of Basic Income would lock the poorest people into below Living Wage poverty, while giving a pay rise to those who are already earning well above the minimum wage?  Again, really really not convinced."
LabourUK,3csh6c,Patch86UK,3,Sat Jul 11 09:25:17 2015 UTC,"Well, ignore green policy as it is a facade with basic income. A universal basic income should be implemented as it would be equivalent to a living wage. Then minimum wage gets abolished as companies can charge what they want for wages, but people now have the power and freedom to choose what they want to work. So someone could work for 2 pound an hour and that will supplement the UBI. However the reality is that companies will need to pay a decent wage to get people to work. This therefore increases everyone's overall spending and employment power as they have the ability to change jobs.  And you are right, the amount will increase but the money spent by the poor and middle classes that now have a large increase in disposable income will now reinvest that into the economy and stimulate growth, creating a positive feedback cycle. The problem atm is that basically all new wealth goes to the rich who do not reinvest money into the economy."
LabourUK,3csh6c,elmo298,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:18 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the green policy for those reasons. But in order to implement it properly you need to raise corporation tax, essentially it does subsidise employment but I don't see that as a bad thing as it reduces the incentive to automate everything.   It really makes the aspirational types happy as it will allow people to create new businesses and art without having to risk going destitute."
LabourUK,3csh6c,Kingy_who,2,Sat Jul 11 14:40:16 2015 UTC,Will have to be brought up in leadership hustings if people can go to it. But you are completely correct that a universal basic income is needed. I emphasise the universal as people often don't understand the difference.

One of my local youth clubs used to be a Connexions drop in and youth hang-out, then it became just the latter, and now it's closed entirely.  And now we have the false dichotomy that you're either working/learning or scrounging, leading the government to thrash young people with cuts to housing benefit and the like.  Yet it seems to not want them to work either, with pay discrimination, grant withdrawal, and a pathetically low ‘living’ wage that is being combined with… slashes in tax credits that make it even less of a living wage?  And yet the Tories' favourite rhetoric is to say that the deficit is this sort of evil monster that'll destroy the futures of young people because they have to pay Labour's costs.  Ha aha ahaa haa haa.  No.  While a deficit isn't particularly great, it is ideologically-focused austerity that is really destroying young people.

Syriza are a very left-wing party, but they've been unable to enact any radical change due to the austerity being imposed on them by the EU.  Kendall's hardly showing much solidarity here and calling a democratically elected party who just held a referendum over the future of the country's negotiation stance is going very far indeed.  It really annoys me how everyone seems to be using the Greek situation to further their political agenda.   I include Corbyn in that, but at least he's actually talked about writing off debt rather than labeling socialists as fucking extremist. By Kendall's standards the entire Labour left should be on a list of Theresa May's."
LabourUK,3crfcg,JustAhobbyish,5,Fri Jul 10 04:22:37 2015 UTC,Question you need to ask is why is she saying this?  Answer is due to the fact we have a debate based on 'fantasy politics' and has no grounding in economics.  By saying this means Tories can't attack her on this area.  She can build up trust and regain control of the debate doing a big U turn in the process when time suits. Tories have done this in 2007/2012 and 2015.   Whole debate is rather funny if we should repay debt Germany should repaid it own debts from WW2 which was written off.
LabourUK,3crfcg,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Fri Jul 10 06:41:17 2015 UTC,"And, to be fair to her, much as I sympathise with Syriza, they've been unable to do what they said they would.

Actually you can stay in the EU without making any major structural changes to debt, deficit and public spending in Greece. Don't worry about the IMF, they're just a bunch of bean counters, what do they know?' but until that happens, Syriza kind of is living in a fantasy world."

I mean while the Greens here were talking about a 60% rate on those earning £150k,  Syriza were only suggesting that on those earning €500k   Syrizas problem wasn't that they were uncompromising Communists, they had already conceded massively to the Troika,  they just underestimated how intransigent the Eurogroup would be and how willing they were to turn the screw on Greece.    http://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/080715/we-underestimated-their-power-greek-government-insider-lifts-lid-five-months-humiliation-and-blackm?onglet=full"

LabourUK,3crfcg,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Fri Jul 10 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"Eurocommunists, Marxist analyses, listen to yourself. The world moved on from all this nonsense decades upon decades ago, it heaved its last breaths of remote validity in the early 1970s. The only person stuck in the past is you unfortunately. Only Marxists can argue with a straight face that the unchanged, unaltered theories of a long-dead bearded German from the mid-Victorian Era still hold 100% validity today, while condemning others as 'backwards reactionaries'  If you think the crisis of 2008 remotely represents a 'crisis of Capitalism' with world wide Proletarian socialist revolution now immediate, you're deluded. Does it represent reform in how we do things? Almost definitely, it already has brought such reform in the USA. Marxists have been predicting the death of Capitalism every single crisis since the 1850s and it never comes, because shock-horror, socialism is not the end of history or the inevitable next stage of history. Its been consigned to the ash heap of history long ago, by the march of progress, the public, the working class and thankfully, the Labour Party. I am committed to keeping it that way."

I wouldn't describe myself as a Marxist, but I'm not so arrogant as to ignore such a comprehensive critique of the utopian market ideals that underpin our current political settlement.   Lmao, no. Das Kapital is filled with outdated economic premises, and everything in it that still stands has been said by someone else and does not predicate Marx's own theories in any notable manner. The novelty of Das Kapital has increased recently, but it in no way accurately described, predicted or explained the 2008 crash well at all, to claim so is laughably delusional. I will discount out of hand, because its ideas and proposals unilaterally failed after slaughtering millions upon millions of innocent people, and, as I said above, most of Marx's fundamental theories like labour theory of value and tendencies in accumulation of capital have been factually proven completely wrong.    This is the problem, it's too fucking easy to discount people as mad out of touch lefties, and associate them with the aberrations of the 20th century, and just blindly accept that the way things work at the moment is the only way.   We're discounting you because to pretend Marx is relevant is dumb and will get you laughed out of any place of economic academia immediately. Discussing Marx in philosophical and sociological circles is mostly limited to his historic contributions, and its widely acknowledged that his theories hold little weight today and have largely been demonstrated as false or misdirected. The problem here is you assume that its Marxism vs. Capitalism, totally ignoring the tens of hundreds of subschools of Capitalism. Accepting that Capitalism and the market economy works is not unilaterially accepting everything anyone has done in the past 30 years in the field of economic policy, that's idiotic.   Im sorry but no amount of kicking and screaming is going to make Marx relevant again, he is unilaterally irrelevant to all but college yuppies and pseudo-intellectuals, and picking up his tomes once more spells death for the Labour Party, both in intellectual integrity and at the ballot box.

(To be honest, he was so in his element that he didn't quite answer the question, which was on what we should learn as a party from Greece).

Recession. What killed Brown? Recession. Each time a government has changed hands in the last half a century, it's been because of an economic downturn that they've been unable to navigate. Osbourne has continuously over the last five years left himself extremely vulnerable to any economic downturns, staking his whole reputation on it never happening.

He rather good at playing the game of politics respect him for that.  However he has left himself with major storm clouds with no plan on dealing with them.

I just don't buy into the idea that being Euroskeptic makes someone a martyr to some imaginary racist witch hunt squad, or that everyone on the left (apart from this new, enlightened anti-EU group - which isn't new or enlightened) howls racism every time someone raises a reasonable question about Europe."

I'm not saying that Syriza is infallible and everything they've done is beyond reproach—far from it, their recent approach to talks has been very lacklustre no matter from which ideological point of view you look at it—but the EU's response has been very disheartening.  Yes, when you loan money you expect it back.  But these are countries we're talking about.  When you shake down Greece for money, you shake down millions of innocent people who have suffered under the haphazard and failed application of bailout conditions, and quite rightly feel very wary about having even more of it.  And Greece's loans are entirely unsustainable, expecting them to pay back threatens the entire Eurozone, and as this article shows the whole affair is making the EU look bad, not just necessarily Greece.  I'm all for a common market and good diplomatic relations.  But being part of a democracy-starved system of enforcing toxic neoliberalism (not just this, but TTIP, privatisation directives, etc. etc.) is making me very uncomfortable.  Any more and I want out."

It's still going to be 65p lower than the rate set by the Living Wage Foundation, and £1.95 lower than the London rate. £9 by 2020 isn't particularly impressive at all after factoring in inflation and given that the current London rate is supposed to be £9.15 today, let alone in 5 years time.  But he'll be on telly for the next few years, crowing about his party's legacy being introducing the 'living wage' for 'one nation' when all he's really done is rename the minimum wage and push it slightly higher."

LabourUK,3cjn21,aenor,2,Wed Jul 8 13:22:52 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the fact that the living wage takes into account the tax credits that people receive. With tax credits now being cut, the actual living wage will have to increase. Furthermore, you have to be 25 or older to benefit from it, which just hurts the young more and may even lead to those aged 25 and older being sacked in favour of those aged 24 and younger.  At first I was relatively pleased to see such a large increase in the minimum wage, but he's just playing a very clever game which he hopes he can use to his advantage when he presumably runs for the Tory leadership. I'm quite annoyed about many of the things in this budget, but this ""living wage"" nonsense is the most infuriating, as predictably it's grabbed most of the headlines."

Over 25s are the only ones who're going to be receiving it according to this, and the immediate raise up to 7.20£ next week from 6.50£ is less than a pound increase. There're plenty of young people in work, I myself was one of them, below that age who're trying to help pay bills and they have no benefit from this at all. Osborne is stealing the words and watering down the policies straight from Labour's platform. Watch him prance around claiming to be humane one-nation Tory over the next few months, due to an almost totally symbolic act. I will credit them with low af inflation, so the wage rise will mean a fair amount, but its still not substantial enough. A 1.50£ immediate increase and I'd be satisfied.  Oh and that totally useless 1% corporation tax cut, we already have one that's pathetically low and now its even lower. Hit the poor harder! Harder!"
LabourUK,3cjn21,TrickyDickNixonbot,3,Wed Jul 8 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'd also be interested to see how much of the minimum wage increase is counteracted by the cuts to in-work benefits like tax credits. Someone will run analysis on this and find that it waters down the impact quite significantly, I'm sure.  Low inflation has very little to do with the Chancellor, by the way. Governments have very little power to control inflation - it's a Bank of England responsibility through money supply and interest rates, especially after 1998 when the BoE was made independent."

Oh man I didn't even think of this, our friends at New Statesman will probably end up running the numbers on this like they usually do. The more I look at this, the more what little concessions were made to Labour (mostly in the form of rhetoric) are just hot air and symbolic, its all smoke and mirrors to cover what is effectively a totally unbalanced and cruel budget.   Low inflation has very little to do with the Chancellor, by the way. Governments have very little power to control inflation - it's a Bank of England responsibility through money supply and interest rates, especially after 1998 when the BoE was made independent.

What that means is, if you raise either the minimum or living wage by less than the value of tax credits, then cut tax credits, you're leaving people worse off."

The Government has also delayed the expected return to a budget surplus by a year to 2019-20, but is then aiming for a slightly bigger surplus in the medium term.   The moment of sudden surplus is even later than previously. So, we're now on to Plan Q, at my count.  What do we all think about loans instead of student grants? Given that it was the grants that were helping the rest of the UK outperform Scotland on number of working class kids going to uni, it might be a little problematic."
LabourUK,3cjn21,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"Most students from England don't get a significant maintenance grant, if any, as it is. The majority of my maintenance (not including tuition fee loans) was in the form of a loan, which decreased. This might not be 100% representative, as this was means tested using my parents' income.  2011/12: £4896 loan + £109 grant  2012/13: £4884 loan + £133 grant  2013/14: £3465 loan + no grant  2014/15: £3332 loan + no grant"
LabourUK,3cjn21,CaptainHayashi,2,Wed Jul 8 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"That's not very representative. The maximum yearly grant is £3,387 if the student's family income is less than £25,000 a year. It goes down in intervals depending on income, so those with income above about £42,000 a year don't get any grants.  Essentially, Osborne's policy means that students from poorer backgrounds (like I was) will leave university with significantly more debt than their middle-class counterparts, entrenching the already-existing inequality. They're going to be punished for being born to a less well-off family.  We're looking at kids from the poorest background leaving uni with around £55,000 of debt - and that's before tuition fees start rising with inflation from 2017."

I also think its incredibly unfair to call the Democrats right-wing, Obama rejuvenated Keynesian economic policies and introduced some of the toughest banking regulations post-crash, far tougher than us. Look up the Fiscal Stimulus Act 2008 and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Republicans are also having an added Jesus content backlash lately, the moderates will probably take over the party in the primaries and if they dont, the Democrats will wipe them out in 2016 guaranteed. I'd also like to clarify that my admiration of the American political system is not their consensus political opinions, but the structure of the system that encourages bipartisan and consensus politics. If we had a similar system in the UK, no doubt it'd produce different policies, we are not Americans after all.   Closer alliance with the USA inevitably means more war. No one wants that.   Eh.

I think invoking previously failed wars is a bit of a fallacy, since all those wars were fought with vastly different contexts and motivations. Need I remind you that Afghanistan hasn't exactly been a total failure, the Afghan National Army is actually independently annihilating the Taliban, and the country has overall had a net gain from the regime change. Although not fully-functioning, its elections have been fairly democratic, although there still have to be huge compromises. Its short-sighted and misplaced, IMO, to condemn Afghanistan as a giant failure.   Iraq's legality is honestly fairly irrelevant to me, sometimes international law has to be broken for the sake of protecting stability and a populace. It'd also have been illegal to intervene in Rwanda for instance, but I think such an intervention would've been 100% justified and necessary. Saddam was known for previously attempting to develop WMDs, he had refused to disclose the status of WMDs in his country, he had refused UN inspectors, and he was engaging in a massive military buildup where his army surpassed pre-Gulf War levels. With this information presented to you, would you have taken action? I certainly would against a dictator known to use chemical weapons on his own people and invade sovereign countries in attempts to annex them.    You can't fight guerrilla fighters in the modern age, arguably the only defeat of true guerrilla warfare was the Boer war, which if it took place today, all our leaders would be tried for war crimes.   See above. Its also worth noting that some of the iconic guerilla wars of our age, I.E. Vietnam, probably could've been won if different strategies were used. Theres a wealth of military historical analysis of this stuff but thats irrelevant. We're a politics board lol    Lobbying is legal in America and it takes billions to win the presidency.   America is a much larger country with an infinitely larger population, not to mention third parties (Ross Perot's Reform Party in 1992 and 1996) have actually managed to claim significant portions of the popular vote, almost 20% in Perot's case. The Reform Party also got the governorship of Minnesota in 1998 with a crowd-funded campaign, a third party candidate stood two-terms as Connecticut's governor in the late 90s and early 2000s, an Independent currently stands as Alaska's Governor and has implemented a sort of basic income on a state level, and a Constitution Party candidate almost won the Colorado gubernatorials in 2012, losing by a margin of less than 3% of the vote. The simple reason is that for the most part, the Democrats and Republicans have become immense big tent parties, with the GOP containing everything from Libertarians to Paleocons to Distributists, and the Democrats containing everything from Centrists to Liberals to Social-Democrats.    Isn't in universally accepted Bush didn't win his first election too?   Thats America's weird electoral college thing, which they've had since day one when the constitution was penned.

One unrepresentative anecdote is not a ""wake up call"" and for Burnham to have brought it up is shameful. It just plays into all the scaremongering myths about immigration. You could equally have cherry picked a story about a business that could not stay open without immigrant labour because British people don't want to take the jobs."

As you can see, Labour lost three times as many voters to the SNP and the Greens as to UKIP. Of the 24% of 2010 voters that Labour lost, only 10% went to UKIP. The bulk of new UKIP voters are ex-tories.  The reason I say it is shameful is that (even if it's true) it illustrates nothing about the effects of immigration on the UK. Only 0.2% of the population speaks no English. There is just no way in which this is pressing social issue. All Burnham managed to do was pander to those who are pretending that is is."

Anyway, assuming that it is correct, I still believe it is important to target every single one of the ex-labour votes on that inforgraphic. As someone living in scotland, who voted SNP and is moving to England and joining labour, I can tell you that it wasn't immigration that made anyone I know switch to the SNP, it was issues like trident, Iraq, support for PR, seriously dealing with climate change, tuition fees etc. It is possible to be fair on (not anti) immigration while also championing various left wing causes.   Moreover, it is possible to win back UKIP support on immigration while helping immigrants at the same time: if a candidate said something like, ""we believe that it is important for immigrants to learn English, as a lack of it leads to a lack of integration in local communities, and for the immigrants, it raises the chances of them being exploited for cheap labour. As a consequence, the Labour party will introduce free english lessons for all immigrants coming to the UK to help them live here among us.""

As long as we're in a union where you can locate in one member state and do business in another state and then transfer the profits via a ""royalty payment"", we won't collect a penny on this.  The only people who'll be forced to pay are small businesses. Which would put them at a disadvantage against larger businesses. Think a small independent coffee shop paying full corporation tax, competing against Starbucks paying dip-squat. The whole burden would fall on hairdressers, mechanics and so on, while big corporations (BMW, Google, Microsoft and so on) would pay nothing.  Notice also that NAFTA does not have this corporate tax shopping thing, which is why federal US corporate tax is 35% (and you are correct, when the state corporate tax is added it's 39% in total). Some American businesses have relocated to Mexico for the cheaper labour, but none to do corporate tax evasion because that's not allowed on the NAFTA rules.  This is why I think Labour has been asleep at the wheel over this whole EU re-negotiation and referendum thing.   Instead of us saying ""we think everything in the EU is luverly"" and leaving it to Cameron to come up with his list of things to be renegotiated, we should have been out there saying ""This is a list of things we want changed in the EU"" and should have been pushing hard for it. Cameron will try to renegotiate social stuff, but he won't touch corporate tax because his donors would lynch him if he did.  How have we got into a situation where we are arguing against our own interests in the EU? Because some in the party do a knee-jerk ""if Farage is for it, we're against it, sight unseen"", instead of taking a hard look at the facts and looking at what is working and what is not.  P.S. See the following for how the tax evasion works in the EU:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement   Typically, the company arranges for the rights to exploit intellectual property outside the United States to be owned by an offshore company. This is achieved by entering into a cost sharing agreement between the US parent and the offshore company, written strictly in terms of US transfer pricing rules. The offshore company continues to receive all of the profits from exploitation of the rights outside the US, but without paying US tax on the profits unless and until they are remitted to the US.[6]  It is called double Irish because it requires two Irish companies to complete the structure. One of these companies is tax resident in a tax haven, such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Irish tax law currently provides that a company is tax resident where its central management and control is located, not where it is incorporated, so that it is possible for the first Irish company not to be tax resident in Ireland. This company is the offshore entity which owns the valuable non US rights that are then licensed to a second Irish company (and this one is tax resident in Ireland) in return for substantial royalties or other fees. The second Irish company receives income from the use of the asset in countries outside the US, but its taxable profits are low because the royalties or fees paid to the first Irish company are tax-deductible expenses. The remaining profits are taxed at the Irish rate of 12.5%.  For companies whose ultimate ownership is located in the United States, the payments between the two related Irish companies might be non-tax-deferrable and subject to current taxation as Subpart F income under the Internal Revenue Service's Controlled Foreign Corporation regulations if the structure is not set up properly. This is avoided by organizing the second Irish company as a fully owned subsidiary of the first Irish company resident in the tax haven, and then making an entity classification election for the second Irish company to be disregarded as a separate entity from its owner, the first Irish company. The payments between the two Irish companies are then ignored for US tax purposes.[1]  Ireland does not levy withholding tax on certain receipts from European Union member States. Revenues from sales of the products shipped by the second Irish company (the second in the double Irish) are first booked by a shell company in the Netherlands, taking advantage of generous tax laws there. Overcoming[clarification needed] the Irish tax system, the remaining profits are transferred directly to Cayman Islands or Bermuda. This entire scheme is referred to as the ""Dutch sandwich"".[7][8] The Irish authorities never see the full revenues and hence cannot tax them, even at the low Irish corporate tax rates.   If we were outside the EU, it would be simple to legislate for revenues earned in the UK to be taxed in the UK."

LabourUK,3cia50,JustAhobbyish,2,Thu Jul 9 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"It's to do with how corporation tax fits into to the broader arrayed measures in the relevant tax regime. Income taxes are generally (I think) higher in the UK than the US, so the money comes from individuals rather than their businesses.   It's also harder to collect, so raising it may add to your enforcement costs. But this also depends on the exact environment.   Direct taxes will have an indirect effect on operating costs, prices and wages as there will be less profit available to reinvest back into the business. Without restructuring the business, it can make growing it more difficult.   Competitive taxes isn't the be all and end all, but it is something a multinational may definitely consider."

LabourUK,3cf72b,aenor,2,Tue Jul 7 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"/r/ukpolitics was actively brigaded (I've never subbed to /r/unitedkingdom, so I have no idea what's happening over there), which so far isn't a problem here, and doesn't seem likely to be, as we're too small and niche to piss anyone off.  So far, things haven't gotten really nasty: There's been a bit of swearing but all the name-calling has either been abstract ('Trots think that...') or aimed at people not on the sub ('Liz is a Red Tory), and while I've seen a bit of downvoting, there's been no-one getting downvoted into oblivion for making valid points or finding themselves blocked from posting due to downvoting. No-one's felt the need to report a post, either.  Essentially what I'm saying is: The sub's working fine. There's definitely debate and it's not always especially clever, but it's not actually causing problems. What negativity there is seems to be cyclical: About a week ago, all the negativity was aimed at Liz Kendall; now, it's Corbyn's turn."
LabourUK,3cf72b,elmo298,4,Tue Jul 7 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"I think some of the 34 votes would have been cast by people who are not Labour members and support far left political parties that have no interest in a Labour victory, such as the Communist Party of Britain, SWP and Socialist Party (AKA Militant)   This is what I've been saying. We've let a bunch of people not in the Labour Party decide who our biggest affiliate supports for leader of the Labour Party. Madness."
LabourUK,3cf72b,elmo298,2,Tue Jul 7 13:10:39 2015 UTC,"This is also the fault of the cretins in the Parliamentary party who signed his nomination even though they had no intention of voting for him. If you don't intend voting for him, why sign?"
LabourUK,3cf72b,elmo298,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"Sucking up to the grassroots. That's why all the London mayoral candidates who are MPs did it.  EDIT: Actually, Diane Abbott probably actually believes in a lot of of what Corbyn says, but I'm pretty sure for the rest of them it was just politics."
LabourUK,3cf72b,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Tue Jul 7 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"I'm confused. You say sucking up to grassroots but what is the problem in listening to people? There was a clear want for corbyn to be on the list from members and for people to be so against it is shameful. This entire thread is you and that other guy saying how he shouldn't be here, yet you say you defended liz kendall as people think she's too 'right' on the spectrum. Why shouldn't a part of the party have their wanted candidate as a leader. I mean the fact that he's third in clp shows that he has a clear appeal than all the 'crazy commies and lefties' of the party."
LabourUK,3cf72b,rappersdo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"The mayoral candidates, like most of Corbyn's PLP backers, had no intent of supporting him or his policies and only let him be on the ballot because they were certain he'd lose. That's not, I don't think, a particularly pleasant way to behave. At best it's pretty condescending.  But the argument was 'We should have a proper debate!' Now, I don't think having someone whose views are outdated, unpopular and have been repeatedly rejected by the electorate is what makes a debate 'proper', but, again, lets be charitable and say we should have a proper debate and Corbyn's views should be part of that.  But then the fact is, we already had the 'Should we be pro- or anti-austerity?' debate as a party: Diane Abbott and Ed Balls both ran on anti-austerity tickets and lost. The party voted for pro-austerity candidates to first and second place in that ballot. So, not only have we agreed, as a party, that we don't particularly want Corbyn's socialism, we also agreed that we don't want his anti-austerity. And yet, here we are, having the same debate again.  I haven't actually argued that Corbyn 'shouldn't' be on the ballot (although I'll certainly argue that he shouldn't win and that people shouldn't vote for him, as is my right). However, the rules we have in place are pretty clear about the PLP picking the candidates. What has instead happened is that a few members of the PLP have lent their support to a candidate who has no chance of winning anything and who, were he somehow elected leader, would almost certainly immediately face a vote of no confidence. So, instead of having a proper debate among the people the PLP are actually willing to back, we're having a silly, mock debate including three people the PLP might really support and one random dude we threw in there for some reason.  Then we have the whole additional thing where we have people who aren't in the Party at all deciding who our biggest affiliate backs for leader, and the fact that at least some of Corbyn's support comes from people, on the left or the right, who actively and openly want to destroy the Labour Party, and it should be apparent why I, /u/TrickyDickNixonbot and a lot of other people are pretty infuriated by this whole thing."
LabourUK,3cf72b,TrickyDickNixonbot,3,Wed Jul 8 08:37:52 2015 UTC,"Well I will have to respectfully disagree with you. I mean I'm 75% Corbyn 25% Cooper atm, but Jeremy's attitudes aren't outdated nor unpopular. Throughout his career he has actively campaigned for equality and his political attitude towards social housing, living wages, renationalisation of the railways and no more foreign interventions are popular with the elctorate, even with more centre-tories, SNP and UKIP.   I will agree the way he got into the contest wasn't the best, but he only chimed in a week before the leadership ended and in that week garnered a massive grassroots movement from supporters. No other candidate had it and if that sort of backing from the longest standing MP in the elections currently can't allow them to have a say then I believe the system needs to be better. You say candidates felt they had to break their own code, which shows the system is flawed.  If he were to get in today and then like you believe (which again I disagree), recieve a vote of no-confidence, it would destroy the Labour party who wouldn't even support a nominated leader. I doubt that would happen at all.  You say the left comes to destroy the party and so does the right. Well no, there is no real evidence to suggest that a significant number of right-wing folk are coming to take over the elections aside from the scaremongering #. I mean you argue for Liz Kendall and she is by far the most conservative apologist in the elections. And regarding the 'left' aspect - they are coming back to the party to evolve Labour not destroy it. I don't think you should feel the need to think 'your' party is under threat when it was founded as a party for the people and shall be moulded by popular movement.   The trade unions can see the appeal and are all starting to back Corbyn, which actually might benefit Burnham as it will keep him out of the Tory union-bashing if Burnham gets elected.  I mean you want to stay with the current paradigm and continue New Labour and neoliberalism from what I can see, but look at the electoral votes since New Labour got into power. the proportion of people voting for Labour has continually dropped until Ed Miliband came along with an increase, and even then the massive majority missing to secure an electoral win were the poorest voters. The poorest demographics have been hit the worst by this government, and will be hit EVEN harder today and for the next five years. They will be searching for an alternative and is what UKIP and the SNP have been offering.  Ed unfortunately didn't offer a real alternative which is why he couldn't attract the voters, and in Scotland siding with the tories was their seppaku. If Corbyn was elected he would do better than the others at reclaiming the Scottish heartlands, and also voters who are disenfranchised with the current paradigm.   The Overton window isn't as far to the right as people believe, and I genuinely think he a real alternatie will allow the Labour party to better themselves and regain masses of lost voters."
LabourUK,3cf72b,rappersdo,2,Wed Jul 8 10:06:25 2015 UTC,"Look, most of what you've just written is either a wild misrepresentation of my points of view or a frankly inaccurate reading of the facts.   Jeremy's attitudes aren't outdated nor unpopular.   Corbyn supports nuclear disarmament and thinks Iran and North Korea should be allowed nuclear weapons. These are wildly unpopular positions. His views on nationalisation are also deeply outdated. There are valid criticisms to be made of capitalism and our current system and valid ways we could improve things, but nationalisation of everything is not among them, which is why no serious economist supports them any more.   No other candidate had [grassroots support]   All the candidates had plenty of grassroots support; they just didn't need it to get on the ballot.   If he were to get in today and then like you believe (which again I disagree), recieve a vote of no-confidence, it would destroy the Labour party who wouldn't even support a nominated leader.   The Labour Party wouldn't be able to support him as leader. He could not lead the party, because he does not have the support of the PLP, and so the party could not function.   You say the left comes to destroy the party and so does the right. Well no, there is no real evidence to suggest that a significant number of right-wing folk are coming to take over the elections   I didn't say it was a significant number, I said it was real, and that it was happening, even if only in small numbers. Some of his supporters, maybe only a very small number, but including people on the Executive Council of Unite, actually want to destroy the Labour Party. I think this is a problem. I think if you support someone who is also supported by people who want to destroy the Party, you need to seriously think about your support.    I mean you argue for Liz Kendall and she is by far the most conservative apologist in the elections   Actually, I support Yvette. I just think Kendall has some good ideas, like increasing worker ownership of companies and trade union membership in the private sector (wow, how right wing!) and should be taken seriously.   conservative apologist   Or, actually, she just points out that we absolutely will not get elected if we are perceived as X, Y or Z and therefore we should not be perceived as X, Y or Z.   And regarding the 'left' aspect - they are coming back to the party to evolve Labour not destroy it.   No. See above. The Communist Party and the Socialist Workers Party actually want to destroy the party.   The poorest demographics have been hit the worst by this government, and will be hit EVEN harder today and for the next five years   I know, that's why we need to win, not to elect someone who cannot win.   They will be searching for an alternative and is what UKIP and the SNP have been offering.  Ed unfortunately didn't offer a real alternative which is why he couldn't attract the voter   This is the factual inaccuracy I was referring to. The SNP and Ukip were not wildly different from existing parties. Labour's manifesto was as different from the Tories as it has been in a long, long time. I'm not just saying this, either; this is based on what the IFS said about them before the election. The people had a 'real alternative' and decided to vote for the Tories in even greater numbers than previously, which shows you exactly what they thought of our 'real alternative'.  By the way, even if we had won every vote cast for the SNP, we still would've lost.   Scotland   More factual inaccuracies. What happened in Scotland is that it became apparent that 45% of the population supports nationalism, and there was one party that could easily sweep up that whole vote. It had nothing to do with being left-wing or siding with Tories, and by saying that it did, you're buying into the SNP's bullshit.  By the way, the SNP are the most evil, duplicitous bastards in UK politics at the moment. Frankly, the electorate's fear that we would go into coalition with them was justified, albeit not for the exact reasons people gave. Anyone who says we should do anything to be more like the SNP will not get a hearing from me."
LabourUK,3cf72b,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Wed Jul 8 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"So I wrote a massive essay full of sources and facts to support my argument, but unfortunately my browser closed and reddit stupidly doesn't save them. But here is my summary just as I don't want you to think I am ignoring your response:   No Jeremy does not support North Korea or Iran and even said less than 6 weeks ago how it is a worry North Korea is arming itself. Personally Iran is a overwhelmingly defensive state and if you believe in nuclear deterrants then it could provide some more stability to the region (which is personal opinion) The public don't fully support Jeremy with disarmament, but the majority do support either no renewing trident (around 24%) or renewing trident with a smaller cost fleet and less weapons (around 36% IIRC with these percentages). Nationalising of the railways has it's pros and cons, and the public want them nationalised and he is the only candidate that supports that (over 60%).  Yes they would suport him as it would destroy Labour if the electorate voted him in and then they voted him out. They would find a middle ground between his views and theirs. You implied that people were from the left and right actively trying to destroy Labour but the way you phrased it indicated that it was not a small number. You misunderstood me with Liz. I didn't think you were voting for her but that you were defending her against people hating on her, whilst you do that with Jeremy. I do believe that she has Labour values and has some good policies that she wants to introduce, but she is the furthest right in the leadership campaign whilst the others occupy the centre (apart from Jeremy) and my opinion is that if she comes 4th or even behind Jeremy then it indicates that Labours position should be further to the left.  no it is not a factual innacuracy. With UKIP a lot of votes are disenfranchised voters who seek an alternative, and in times of economic hardship nationalistic parties rise. UKIP has some progressive policies amidst the crud and even if they do not differ from the equilibrium, it is the fact that they are an alternative vote. SNP was due to the fanning of nationalism by the government, labours apathy in scotland and working with the conservatives, and socialist policies. That is what caused the massive rise of the SNP, not just nationalism like you indicate. It was a multitude of factors and pinning it on solely nationalism is more naive than 'buying into the SNP'. People who voted No also voted SNP in the election.  Ed miliband stated he was the only labour leader to say that he would continue cutting public spending, and gave no real alternative to asuterity. This is the point I am making. Across Europe anti-austerity movements are becoming massive and when it is offered (like SNP) it is popular. This is where Ed went wrong, no clear alternative advertised. Conservatives mainly rose due to liberal democrats being destroyed and the majority of conservative gains were in seats where liberal democrats were 1st and conservatives second e.g. Cornwall and the South. Your hate for the SNP is way above any sort of wild innaccuracies and speculation you claim I have, so I would like you to provide some actual evidence how you can claim them to be so terrible. Yes they want independance but they are not as terrible as you imply."
LabourUK,3cf72b,TrickyDickNixonbot,3,Wed Jul 8 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"And as I said on the other thread, the 3£-to-vote-for-leader is causing swarms of Greens and members of small far-left parties to come in just to vote for Corbyn. Tories are also organising to vote for him for an easy victory."

Setting aside his domestic policy views being largely impractical and probably harmful, Corbyn is a doorstep anti-Westernist who takes every opportunity he can to shame liberal democracy as evil and oppressive.

Corbyn is the Russian candidate for leader, thats for certain. His critical stance of NATO expansion and Russian containment and accusations that we're apparently causing the whole crisis and need to 'talk with Russia' is probably the reason for this (along with the bonus of a bankrupt and militarily disabled Britain), as he seems content to allow Russian troops to pour into Ukraine while Britain must apparently restrain from aiding liberal democracies on our doorstep. Not a single other Labour leader has had an interview or article dedicated to them by RT, I might add.   The above article contains all you need to know about his long associations with radical Islamism and excusing it/endorsing it at every opportunity.   Corbyn downplays and apologises for North Korea many times, but a rather prominent event is featured here on his website, where apparently we should be A-okay with North Korea obtaining nuclear weapons, because the oh-so-evil West possesses them. Classic move of that good old far-left moral relatvisim, where a tyrannical regime conducting human experimentation, sterilising the disabled and literally burning dead bodies from concentration camps for field fertiliser is just as entitled to nukes as the West.  Good job Corbyn is slamming the Saudis, I want us to be doing more of that, but it does interest me that the moral clarity he applies there apparently does not apply to the vast multitude of the West's enemies we are taking action against. It also fascinates me that he includes Israel (and not all the above) in countries we must take action against, despite its status as the only liberal democracy in the Middle East."

And I think you need to understand that to a lot of people, Corbyn's world narrative and stances are terrifying and insane, and make people very worried."

I watched the QT too and I didn't get the idea he was sympathising with ISIS on the grounds that we were at fault for their rise, we didn't create ISIS, but we did have a hand in fostering the conditions in which they rose to power. To ignore that is a bit silly considering Britain's support of Saudi Arabia.   You've then used that argument to hoist Corbyn up as 'The Man Who Hates Britain' in true DM fashion. Stop jumping to conclusions and stick to the facts.  I think you're vastly overestimating Corbyn's challenge to the leadership and his view of the world. As enthralling as you may find the RT vs Western Media war, I assure you the vast majority of people don't give a shit about it.   As for the IRA involvement question, it was my understanding he called them a long time ago and invited them over to talk, something which if done sooner could have saved a lot of lives. If you know anything about Ireland, you'll know both sides has a tremendous amount of blood on their hands.  I'm sorry that the left of the party can't just sit in the corner and keep backing leaders who don't represent them.   I don't agree with Corbyn on some issues but to me at least he's an alternative to the same old Tory-lite polices of Cooper and Burnham or indeed the Red Tory herself(Who I think would be more at home on the right of the lib dems, but hey they said the same thing about Blair and the SDP)."

However I will give you what I suspect is the answer- they're a representative democracy (not unlike the UK as a whole), not a direct one. So you elect your reps and your officers, and they collectively decide.. all sorts of things. They don't have to check with you on every matter, because you've voted them some authority to act on your behalf. Just like an MP.  Still, sucks that they didn't at least go through the motions of a consultation. It's the least they should do really."
LabourUK,3cay7t,Patch86UK,2,Mon Jul 6 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"sucks that they didn't at least go through the motions of a consultation. It's the least they should do really.   This is it. Much of the media is reporting it as 'after consultation with the members, which may be the media's fault rather than Unite's, but is still a misrepresentation.  You are of course right that it's a representative democracy. However, part of being an effective representative democracy is transparency. From that point of view, there's a clear failure here, in that the consultantation process is totally opaque so it's not clear who the individual members of the Executive voted for, nor what was recommended to them by whom. Since many members of the Executive are not even actually members of Labour, I find the whole thing deeply problematic."

LabourUK,3cay7t,autowikibot,4,Mon Jul 6 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my perspective as a full-time working postman.  To the vast majority of postal workers I talk to, you'd think that the Labour party may as well be dead to them. They really couldn't care less who was running for leadership, to them it makes absolutely no difference. These people gave up on the Labour party a long time ago, and talking to them you get the impression it would take some very strong convincing for them to come back. Consider that Royal Mail's workforce was completely betrayed by Labour over privatization, and it was under Blair that the postal market was opened up to competition in the first place, leading to the dismal state of affairs we have today. Yet ironically our union (the CWU), is still a Labour party affiliate. The new general secretary won the ballot on the promise of ""no more blind loyalty to Labour"". I have yet to encounter a frontline union rep or even a senior rep that hasn't lost all faith in the Labour party. The shared ideology among many posties is that of more militant trade union values. There is a constant feeling of being at war with the management, and a belief that the workforce could effectively run the shopfloor itself (i've actually witnessed this happen, and it worked without a hitch).  So where am I going with all this? That it shouldn't surprise you that the only candidate to have remotely piqued any interest among the grassroots so far is Corbyn."

At the hustings last weekend, all three non-Kendall candidates promised some form of railway nationalisation, for example (Corbyn- renationalisation now; Cooper and Burnham- creeping nationalisation via DOR and franchising). Even Kendall didn't exactly rule it out. It doesn't get much more of a left wing hobby horse than rail nationalisation, surely."

LabourUK,3cay7t,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Tue Jul 7 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Unite is one of the more troublesome unions, yeah. McCluskey rules that thing with an iron fist and he likes to shove his hard-to-the-left socialist views down everyone's throats as much as he can, a lot more than previous Unite leaders who're willing to compromise anyway. Just a few weeks ago he was threatening to break with Labour unless they caved into his socialist policy demands, which he also didn't consult anyone on and caused a huge backlash from inside the union, especially since he presents it as 'the unions opinion' and 'the working class interest'.  Really, we have to just treat unions like any other special interest group, Len and his mates probably want a return to the 1970s where they can secure themselves a hefty paypacket for doing nothing, and hold the public to ransom whenever people dont like whats being done with their tax money and the overpaid public sector. Inb4 im accused of Thatcherism, but part of the reason we flopped so hard in 1983 is because we refused to concede on points where we were obviously wrong, especially in regards to the unions. Hell, even Callaghan was trying to fight them at the end of his term when they began wrecking the economy by breaking the Social Contract deal.  The British people dont have a positive view of the unions, its a long-standing memory, and stuff like this is just going to make that image far, far worse. It'll also give more credence to blatant anti-union Tory policies."

BuzzFeed (of all media) was hosting, so perhaps blame their organisational skills.  My impressions: the room was most enthusiastic about both Burnham and Corbyn. Cooper was getting a good response, but with more moderate enthusiasm. Kendall...had a challenging day.   Burnham really was stonkingly good at orating- passionate, animated, rabble rousing and believable. His message was definitely on the moderate left- he reiterated the policy on railways of letting DOR bid for franchises as a method of gentle nationalisation, spoke passionately for comprehensive schools and against academies/free schools.  Corbyn was getting a lot of applause for his leftwing stuff- anti war, anti austerity, renationalise the railways now, etc. Very likeable speaker- I could listen to him lecture all day. Witty too- the only one to get laughs out of the room, but didn't descend into comedy either. Very impressive.  Cooper had a policy position similar to Burnham on most points. Generally a greater focus on specific ills instead of big picture stuff- child poverty, etc. Bit less convincing as a rabble rousing orator than the others, with a more measured style. Could work for her if she won, but might not get her across the finishing line if hustings are what decide it.  Kendall. Well, no-one can accuse her of trying to work the room. Railway privatisation? She says it was great. Comprehensive schools? We shouldn't think too harshly about Gove's reforms. You get the idea. Was actually heckled on the schools front, and can't blame them- there were murmurs of disbelief when she as the last answerer to that question took a pro-Gove tack. Confident orator, and didn't seem flustered by the fact she was having a hard time, but didn't particularly outshine the others. Andy was still the stand out speaker.  As for the deputies- honestly, they all came across fantastically. I'd be genuinely thrilled for any of them to win it. Watson was as impressive as you'd expect, and Creasey did very well. Bradshaw, Flint and Eagle all surprised me by how much I liked them. Will be tough to figure out a preference order. They all spoke fascinatingly on grassroots engagement, recruitment drives, and potential changes to the Party structures (e.g. federalisation). I won't try to recount it as I'll screw up the nuances, but I was happy with all of their thoughts on it all."
LabourUK,3cap9v,AnxiousMo-Fo,6,Mon Jul 6 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this is what Kendall meant to say?   I want what parents want: a great school for every child. By 2020 there will be hundreds of free schools, and many of them will be successful and popular with parents.  We can’t go into that election threatening to close them down.  But the Tories are wrong to force free schools and academies on local communities, and they have completely failed to ensure there is proper accountability in the system.  This must change. There must be fair funding per pupil, free schools must take their proper share of children with special educational needs, and they must have a comprehensive intake and curriculum. Importantly, decisions about where new schools are built should prioritise areas where the shortage of places is greatest.  We know that what really makes a difference in education is great heads and great teachers, schools working in partnership with one another, a curriculum that inspires kids and prepares them for the modern world, and ensuring parents are properly engaged. It is these issues – not the Tories ideological obsession with school structures – that will be my priority as Labour’s next leader and Prime Minister. [All emphasis mine.]   Found here.  This is a bit like New Labour's attitude to grammar schools: We don't like them much, we're not building any new ones, but we won't close down the existing ones."

Under the Gove regime, if you cant afford private school and dropped out, regardless of reasons, you're literally fucked. Its disgusting.

I might be being a little unfair to her with my paraphrasing, but I think my impression was the one shared by most of the audience. The question was...something about free schools and academies. The other three all answered with variations of the same themes- comprehensives good, centralisation to the DoE as with academies bad, unqualified teachers bad, etc. Kendall answered along the lines of: we need to stop taking about different types of schools and the educational structures, different types of schools have their place, and so forth. Zero bad to say about the Conservative schools policy, and a not-so-veiled dig at the other three for talking about wanting to change the structures from how they now are.   Like I say, it was pretty clear that the room interpreted it as support for the broad strokes of Gove's reforms, and the audience made that clear.

Ok, Michael Foot messed up the Falklands situation, but that doesn't mean that a grassroots movement is hopeless. If you want to abandon working class support, Green/Plaid/SNP voters in marginal seats, the support of worker cooperatives and unions which created the Labour movement, the support of Green/Red Labour voters, the support of Lazy Labour voters, the support of Scotland, youth support and the support of the North, Liz Kendall is ideal.   This article claims Tony Benn was an outlier, but personally he was easily one of the best Labour leaders we never had - he sold a powerful message that still resonates to this day. There is a public mandate for addressing the environment, providing a credible argument in regards to the benefits of immigration, raising the minimum wage and nationalising industries which would be better off under democratic control - now let's be the party that represents that.  After another 5 years of Tory austerity, NHS mismanagement and increasing wage inequality, people may actually start supporting the socialist ideals that were prevalent in post war Britain. Given we have a strong left wing alternative with the strong backing of the left-wing media, we may starting winning back votes from the SNP, Lib Dems and Greens. Ed Miliband's message managed to gain us support in England, albeit the collapse of the Lib Dems and the surge of the SNP didn't help us particularly. Let's send a message of hope and actually be a party worth voting for - let's not just pander to a few Conservative voters."
LabourUK,3c89qq,Ajnin123,4,Sun Jul 5 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"You say:   Given we have a strong left wing alternative with the strong backing of the left-wing media, we may starting winning back votes from the SNP, Lib Dems and Greens   But as the article points out:   A recent report from the Fabian society said that 80% of the additional votes Labour will need to win in 2020 must come from those who voted Tory in 2015.   What you're suggesting amounts to a mathematical impossibility. And, I'm sorry but as to this:   If you want to abandon working class support, Green/Plaid/SNP voters in marginal seats, the support of worker cooperatives and unions which created the Labour movement, the support of Green/Red Labour voters, the support of Lazy Labour voters, the support of Scotland, youth support and the support of the North, Liz Kendall is ideal.   There is very little reason to believe any of it. Even if there was, those groups are so disparate that it'd be something of an achievement to alienate all of them. Among the general public, Liz Kendall, almost unknown a couple of months ago, was seen as second most likely to win over non-Labour voters after the first hustings.  I, for one, am an active trade unionist and co-operator, and I'm strongly considering Liz as a second or even first preference.  One final thing: The progressive majority is a myth. More people voted for right-wing parties than for left-wing parties in 2015, in an election where the Tories increased their share of the vote (this is true if you don't count Lib Dems as 'right wing' and overwhelmingly true if you do). That is only possible if previously left-wing voters moved to the right. Winning them back is far more effective for Labour and the left in general, than trying to hoover up the left-wing vote."

It must say something about the left wing in Britain that that's how far back we have to go.   If you want to abandon working class support, [...] and the support of the North, Liz Kendall is ideal.   Why is that? She's still a left-wing candidate. As long as she is able to show what she can prioritize. She's what Labour needs to appear to be - economically credible (even though the whole ""overspending"" thing is a myth; we lost that argument) and socially conscientious. This article was linked a few days ago:   Kendall will make the argument for a more competitive banking sector; to ensure that small businesses are able to invest in training and technology; for greater opportunity for employees to own shares in the companies they work for; and for greater trade union membership in the private sector, saying that this “can help raise productivity” by building “more constructive dialogue in companies between management and staff”.   This is the ideal way to promote left-wing policy: by talking about how it will boost productivity. Facilitating owning shares in the company you own is a cornerstone apirational policy; one that benefits working people. The trade union thing is a way of looking to reduce strikes without bizarre laws like a minimum turnout on the ballot, which is popular, but by boosting trade union power rather than reducing it.   After another 5 years of Tory austerity, NHS mismanagement and increasing wage inequality, people may actually start supporting the socialist ideals that were prevalent in post war Britain.   Didn't we say that five years ago? Is this the answer? To wait another five years, with another Ed Miliband? Is this the best the Labour left can do? Wait for the Tories to become an even worse option to most people?   strong backing of the left-wing media   The what media?   we may starting winning back votes from the SNP, Lib Dems and Greens.   Honestly, I think it's more likely that those votes would move back to Labour under Tory rule, than Tory votes. It won't win a majority without the Tory votes too, and moving to the left won't get them back."
LabourUK,3c89qq,tusksrus,3,Mon Jul 6 01:06:47 2015 UTC,"(even though the whole ""overspending"" thing is a myth; we lost that argument)   We lost that argument because Miliband wasn't aggressive enough in refuting it, and Kendall tows the Conservative line on Labour being economically dangerous previously.

LabourUK,3c89qq,CMCyantist,3,Mon Jul 6 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"We lost that argument because Miliband wasn't aggressive enough in refuting it,   Totally agree. It's something Miliband can't be forgiven for, as much as I did think he was a nice, genuine guy. But that argument is lost now. We are not going to win an election by trying to convince the country that what they were told by both parties for five years wasn't true after all - against the tide of the media. It's just not going to happen. We have to let it go. Meanwhile, people are dying because of this Tory government. Ideological purity is a luxury for those rare times of Labour government.   Kendall tows the Conservative line on Labour being economically dangerous previously. As long as she admits it that will be enough to keep us out of power. If Kendall is admitting it, voters are going to believe it and tar her with the same brush.   No - because the public wants Labour to ""learn its lesson"". That means giving some lip service to things like running a surplus. The sort of thing that doesn't need to be kept to; Osborne got away with precisely that broken surplus promise.  Kendall does need to adequately differentiate herself from the Tories. The time for that is after she's become leader (and I think it will not be an unclear difference). Right now, the whole point is to differentiate herself from Andy and Yvette.  As a Blairite myself, I think it's fairly clear that she isn't a Tory. You barely have to scratch the surface to see she's red. But a sensible, electable shade of red. She's the next generation after the Blair/Brown years - the public isn't going to blame her for what Labour did when she wasn't even in Parliament."

LabourUK,3c89qq,Ajnin123,4,Mon Jul 6 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's not about cloning the ""supposedly ideal"" policies in the Conservative party.  It's about protecting the weak - and we can't do that out of govt.   Your hero Tony Benn really trashed the Labour party with his intransigence. He fought Michael Foot, he fought Kinnock, he insisted on the maximum publicity for his batshit crazy ideas to give the public the idea Lab was quite mad and dangerous.  Result: 18 years of Conservative govt. If you think the current govt is bad, it's actually a pussycat compared to Thatcher's govt. Millions lost their jobs. Millions lost their homes, interest rates went to 15%.  And Tony Benn didn't effing care.  He was egotistical. What mattered to him was pursuing his ideas at all costs. And if that made Labour unelectable and meant that loads of vulnerable people got hurt, that was a price worth paying. People losing their jobs, people dying on NHS waiting lists, because Labour couldn't get elected, were a price worth paying for sticking to ideological purity.  The man was an egotistical monster.  Blair on the other hand actually managed to do a lot of good. Yeah, he talked right, but he acted left. NHS waiting lists fell to just six weeks by the end of the Labour govt (they've risen again now).  Politics isn't a game though the media portrays it as such. People actually died waiting for operations because Benn's intransigence made Labour unelectable.   The question you need to ask yourself is whether ideological purity is more important than compassion and empathy. Whether your ego is greater than your willingness to compromise. Who are you willing to sacrifice for purity? And what you are willing to compromise for pragatism and the ability to help people in while in govt?"

LabourUK,3c6xfm,Ajnin123,2,Sun Jul 5 22:43:43 2015 UTC,"Trotskyism:   the political or economic principles of Leon Trotsky, especially the theory that socialism should be established throughout the world by continuing revolution. Trotskyism has generally included elements of anarchism and syndicalism, but the term has come to be used indiscriminately to describe a great many forms of radical socialism.   Anarchism:   belief in the abolition of all government and the organisation of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.   Syndicalism:   a movement for transferring the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution to workers' unions. Influenced by Proudhon and by the French social philosopher Georges Sorel (1847–1922), syndicalism developed in French trade unions during the late 19th century and was at its most vigorous between 1900 and 1914, particularly in France, Italy, Spain, and the US.   Marxism:   the system of economic and political thought developed by Karl Marx, along with Friedrich Engels, especially the doctrine that the state throughout history has been a device for the exploitation of the masses by a dominant class, that class struggle has been the main agency of historical change, and that the capitalist system, containing from the first the seeds of its own decay, will inevitably, after the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, be superseded by a socialist order and a classless society.

There isn't a credible centrist party in the UK, nor is there a credible left wing party, although there are parties that have left wing members and some elements of traditional left wing ideas. How individuals view their party alignments appears to me to be a function of where they think the centre is more than any other factor.  That drift is most obvious in the US right now. Obama is basically a Reagan era moderate Republican with more liberal personal social values, and the Republicans have gone so far to the right that they sound like a fringe party on almost any subject. Trump's candidacy being the zenith of that drift.  Churchill for example had this to say on the NHS:-   “The dis­cov­er­ies of heal­ing sci­ence must be the inher­i­tance of all. That is clear: Dis­ease must be attacked,  whether it occurs in the poor­est or the rich­est man or woman sim­ply on the ground that it is the enemy; and it must be attacked just in the sane way as the fire brigade will give its  full assis­tance to the hum­blest cot­tage as read­ily as to the  most impor­tant mansion….Our pol­icy is to cre­ate a national health ser­vice in order to ensure that every­body in the coun­try, irre­spec­tive of means, age, sex, or occu­pa­tion, shall have equal oppor­tu­ni­ties to ben­e­fit from the best and most up-to-date med­ical and allied ser­vices available.”   No modern Conservative would recognise the post war Conservative party's policy positions as being truly Conservative outside of their views on personal social policy.  So is this era about personal values or the ability of a given set of people to communicate policy ideas and values and is left/right even useful anymore?

LabourUK,3c00p2,toomanyairmiles,2,Sat Jul 4 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"That's my struggle with the line up of candidates at the moment, I'm just not convinced by any of them - the whole contest surrounds what wing of the party is behind which candidate. Its more about our coalition's differences than any clear view of which direction the country needs to go in.  Corbyn has been allegedly thrown in for the sake of debate, but what debate? It's like watching four of the seven dwarves talk to each other."
LabourUK,3c00p2,Dangerman1337,2,Sat Jul 4 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ATM it feels like IMO we have; Jeremy ""kick some shit up for shits and giggles"" Cobryn (throws a bunch of controversy for the sake of it), Andy ""the Westminster bubble"" Burnham (though has been part of it since the beginning), Liz ""reform socialism!"" (Liz talking about socialism is going to get brought up, the Lizard of Oz is going to have a fun with that) and Yvette ""look I'm experienced"" Cooper (again history with expenses and Ed Balls association). There seems more of a concern of talking about the past despite ignoring that Blair's 2001 (incredibly poor turnout) and 2005 election weren't that great on paper (Labour won more votes in England in 2015 than 2005) and when they do debate about the future its about ""should we go left, stay as we are or to the 'center'""."

In fact, Ed's dad was a Marxist, so he really is a ‘Marxist’, and the apple never falls far from the tree (how David managed to neither be a Marxist nor a ‘Marxist’ is one of the greatest conundrums of the century).

""Blairite"" is an insult around much of the Labour party.   a) he won elections, without doing that being ""right"" doesn't fucking matter. It would matter slightly more if we had PR, but Labour won't support that, will they? Turkeys, Christmas, etc.  b) He actually did a decent job running the country.   Even Iraq, for which he is routinely crucified: Assume for a moment that the dossier was presented to him as it was to us, I'm sure it wasn't quite, but let's take the broad strokes at face value. There was, according to the best information he had available, an imminent threat against this country. How do you make any other decision?   Of course I'm not saying it was perfectly conceived and executed, but put yourself in his shoes for a moment.   So the economy?   Yes, they over-spent. Much of it was necessary after an extended Conservative government who chronically underspent, so schools and hospitals and infrastructure wanted sorting out. Should never have sold the gold reserves, and the Child Trust Fund was moronic in 17 different ways.   Otherwise: taxation was pretty fair, I'd have tweaked to my preference  but it wasn't ""screw the rich"" and it wasn't all ""tax the poor, there's more of them"" - his government straddled that line pretty well.   Social policy? Not great for a Labour leader, but a lot of social policy is economics and the country hadn't caught up with widespread acceptance.   Immigration ""Boomed"", sure, but that was an EU membership thing, and they added economic value. There is a sensible conversation to be had about social costs of immigration, but we never had it, the edges just shout at each other.   I don't love the guy, I don't like much of what he's done since leaving office, and I don't think I'd want to go for a beer with him (beyond maybe ""it would be nice to pick the brain of a former PM away from all media""), but seriously, why all the hate?"
LabourUK,3c10lu,Evsie,3,Fri Jul 3 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"Dont do that, you arent allowed to like Blair, yelling Iraq and Neoliberalism incoherently is a perfectly solid anti-Blair argument dont you know? Never mind Blair brought back the Keynesian tactic of running a constant small deficit, never mind Blair rapidly reduced child poverty, never mind Blair oversaw the longest sustained growth (that everyone benefited from, demonstrated in income rising) in British history for two centuries, never mind Blair managed to rapidly expand employment with the vastly popular New Deal program, never mind Blair won Scotland 3 times straight with an overwhelming majority, never mind the original plan for rebuilding Iraq drawn up never got put into action thanks to the anti-war movement, never mind Iraq was a country that less than 15 years earlier had invaded an independent sovereign nation, never mind that Iraq had a long history of attempting to develop nuclear weapons, never mind any of that; Neoliberal! Warmongerer! Those are perfectly solid, academic arguments against the tyranny of Tony.

That's why I'm a ""lefty"".   If Labour wants to go hard left, that's fine, if that's what the members are saying, so be it... but I need a party to vote for too, and if Labour aren't it, can we get PR in place so Red Torys and Blue Labourites have a suitable box to stick our X in?"
LabourUK,3c10lu,gamas,2,Fri Jul 3 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"I just dont get this fixation with small state/big state, for me its what delivers the objectives the best. Rampant nationalisation or rampant deregulation seem to be equally harmful. I hate to play appeal to the centre but in many cases, this is sort of it. The problem with Labour's dyed-in-the-red wing is that it just sees the state as an end in itself, public ownership is just a thing that needs to be done because its public ownership and private ownership is evil because reasons. The same applies to the Thatcherist of the Thatcherites who just think everything has to be privately owned because private ownership =/= government and government is somehow literally Hitler ala Hayek's laughably bad theories."
LabourUK,3c10lu,jylg,2,Fri Jul 3 22:11:50 2015 UTC,"As a leftist, I tend to agree, that nationalisation for the sake of nationalisation is stupid.  I would be fine with privatisation provided that it was done because it offers a better deal for the public - cutting costs whilst offering a better quality of service. My issue however is that Kendall seems to lean too far toward the ""deregulate for the sake of deregulation"" angle.  Personally though, I don't actually give a shit about the nationalisation aspect. I care more about a Labour that moves away from supporting excessive state surveillance - I want a Labour that will oppose any and all bills that threaten privacy.   I care about a Labour that puts the people first - I don't want a Labour that will slash welfare and healthcare just to try and fulfil some imaginary goal of somehow being the only country with a population >1million that doesn't have debt... To me Labour moved on from the classic working-class socialist roots and is now supposed to be the party that is about looking out for the less well off and less fortunate - it's time they start acting like it. I don't give a flying shit about socialism/capitalism and all that nonsense, all I care about is the need for a government that prioritises people getting the help and support they need above all else.  From my perspective, I only give a shit about the economy if the economy is used to then help people. I don't care if we are one of the 8 highest economies, what does it matter how big our economy is, if the people who need financial and other support the most aren't seeing any of the money going toward them?"
LabourUK,3c10lu,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"Then we share the same views my friend. I dont think you have to support nationalisation to be a leftist, in fact I find it sorta annoying that 'leftist' is being tagged to the party's socialist left, when we're all lefties if we're in Labour. While I think we should give Kendall a fairer cut and wait a bit longer (who knows, she may fire off some cool stuff since right now her attacks on welfare are limited to just that, attacks, with no solutions. What if she goes down the basic income route?) before we slam her as Thatcher in red, I agree with the general sentiment. We're about looking after the less fortunate and pulling everyone through together in the best possible way, sometimes that involves regulating, sometimes deregulating, sometimes privatisation, sometimes nationalisation. However, our sole goal is to make sure we provide the best possible social security net, healthcare service and stable employment market we possibly can."

They just misread the question. They thought it asked if the electorate needed to change drastically.   Of the Conservative councillors in key seats we surveyed it was Liz Kendall (38.1 per cent) not Andy Burnham (31.3 per cent) who they felt would be the biggest threat to Tory victory in 2020.

LabourUK,3bm9wz,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Tue Jun 30 10:48:41 2015 UTC,"I've just read the speech she gave. Summary:  BUDGET:   Run surpluses in good times. Need to be trusted with people's money. Echoing the social democratic policies of Blair - a strong private sector vital to provide revenue for public services.   ECONOMY:   Need a high-wage economy. Echoing Harold Wilson's 'White Heat' speech - embrace technology for the future of our economy. Inequality: 'New Labour was sometimes too cavalier' about people being left behind. Give low-pay commission more powers to help shift industries to living wage level. Worker representation on company boards.   TRAINING:   Co-operate with unions and business to focus on apprenticeships and on-the-job training, rather than just school qualifications - possibly through individual learning accounts.   BANKING:   Reform banking system so business can get the investment it needs. Look into local banking, innovative funding methods - e.g. crowdfunding.   DEVOLUTION:   Shifting power from central government to local level. More powers for cities. Cities/towns/counties can innovate with jobs programmes etc rather than relying on Westminster gov. More money into local gov. coffers rather than central.     I think she's finally managed to spell out that she does have a vision. I became very sceptical of her over the past few weeks, but I'm now of the opinion that she's probably the candidate with the most exciting vision for the future of the party. A lot of this stuff will need work, and it'll need to be translated into concrete policy terms - but there's time for that. My concern would be that it would be quite easy for the Tories to ape the rhetoric of things like devolution, and they're already doing this on topics like promising a 'high-wage economy'."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,redowl,3,Tue Jun 30 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"Fantastic summary, thanks! I think she's done the best job so far of explaining what she'd actually do -- no mean feat given that she's also had to quickly establish her personality and general beliefs."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,thiswasamisatke,2,Tue Jun 30 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"This does look rather promising, really. I do wonder what would class as a ""good time"" though for running surpluses. I certainly would class our current economic situation as a ""good time,"" nor do I expect it to be amazing by 2018 (when Osborne's cuts are set to end and he hopes to have a surplus, I believe)... But I could be wrong.  I'd also quite like to see devolved parliaments/assemblies for English regions (e.g. north, south, midlands) with similar powers to the Welsh Assembly at least, but maybe that's a bit of a pipe dream."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,rappersdo,2,Tue Jun 30 23:08:07 2015 UTC,"My problem with her and all Blairities for that matter, is they're just not trustworthy, here she is saying she'll have worker representation on company boards.   Blair said the same thing and did nothing when he was in power. We need to move on from Blairism/Brownism but none of the candidates offer that. She'll talk about high wage, but she talks of encouraging companies to pay higher wages rather than raising the minimum wage.  Ed Miliband made a great speech attacking 'predatory business' he wasn't saying all businesses are like that, but Kendall is acting as if the private sector is 100% great and some companies wouldn't pay people in rope if they could get away with it."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,redowl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:03:42 2015 UTC,"I think that's my concern too. A lot of it sounds like stuff that would be nice in theory, but in practical terms is unlikely to happen. Things like worker representation on company boards are surely impossible to achieve beyond tokenism unless you're going to legislate to make it compulsory, which opens up a whole quagmire and I don't see it happening.  'High wage economy' sounds really nice in theory too, but the government's power to actually shape the economy is very limited if it's not going to step on anyone's toes."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,rappersdo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"My problem with her and all Blairities for that matter, is they're just not trustworthy   It's simply jawdropping that you would ascribe such behaviour only to 'her' and 'Blairites'.

Here are some of the reasons this happens:   The (Shadow) Cabinet objects The PLP objects The Labour Party objects The Opposition objects Other parties object The electorate objects The politician has a genuine change of heart Circumstances change in such a way that the policy becomes unnecessary The policy is, in fact, unnecessary Circumstances change in such a way that the policy becomes impractical The policy is, in fact, impractical Circumstances change in such a way that other policies have to take precedence Any or all of the above   All you can do is take the general thrust and aim of the policies they stand on and try and make a rational choice based on that. Things will not turn out as you or they expect. You just do your best. If you don't like the general thrust of Kendall's platform, that's fine, but don't say that you don't like her because Blair, Kendall and/or all Blairites are uniquely perfidious. Such an argument is inaccurate, asinine and self-defeating.   To me it seems she'd be more at home in the lib dems, just like Blair and the SDP in 83, are you saying it's unfair to make this comparison?

To say he was on the far right would be an understatement. But he knew he could win an election by moving Labour to the right, rather than joining a splinter group like the SDP, who's views he was closer to.   Kendall is pitching a message similar to Blair's, polices from all sides of the spectrum, I personally don't buy into what she's saying and just see her as Blair v2.   Now you're saying the platform doesn't matter, meaning the grand vision is an outline? I'm saying it's not one I would like to see implemented."

What I'm saying is that disagreement within a party is normal and okay. What I'm not okay with is this thing where we run around telling people which party they should 'actually' be in, rhetorically or otherwise. I don't tell Corbyn supporters that they should really be in the SWP, for example, and I'd suspect the same from them.  As for Blair, he went through a quite lengthy political development, including being a Marxist at university, which eventually led him to Labour. He certainly could've joined the breakaway SDP in the '80s, as many did, but he stuck with Labour, then won three elections with and for Labour."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,aenor,4,Wed Jul 1 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"I'm so indecisive. Initially, that is before he got on the ballot, I was supporting Jeremy Corbyn. He seemed honest and compassionate, and his anti-austerity message appealed to me. However, he then put me off a bit with his fleeting mention of a ""more planned economy."" Since then I've generally been supporting Yvette, primarily because of her intelligence, experience, and childcare plans, but besides that she doesn't seem to have given a solid outline of her views. Liz, on the other hand, has now given a good outline of what she would seek to achieve. My main quarrel with her is that she still seems to be pro-austerity, but I think all of the main leadership candidates are.   TL;DR: I don't want Andy."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,gamas,8,Tue Jun 30 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"Kendall will make the argument for a more competitive banking sector; to ensure that small businesses are able to invest in training and technology; for greater opportunity for employees to own shares in the companies they work for; and for greater trade union membership in the private sector, saying that this “can help raise productivity” by building “more constructive dialogue in companies between management and staff”.   So, notable Tory Liz Kendall attacks privatisation, backs greater worker ownership of companies and wants more trade union membership in the private sector. Huh. It's almost like she isn't a Tory at all and that's why she's in the Labour Party."
LabourUK,3bm9wz,gamas,2,Tue Jun 30 10:51:02 2015 UTC,Pretty much say trick Tony Blair did sounds right wing but has left wing policy hidden away deep under the message.  What Liz wants to do is quite good in some respects but would require extra funding in order to make it work.

But she's also easy to attack thanks to poor old Ed Balls. Liz is less easy to attack.  With the economy improving, it's almost a dead cert the Conservatives get re-elected again in 2020 (making it 15 years of conservatism) unless Labour takes a radical punt and instead of going for the safe candidate, does something unexpected (and not in a Corbyn type of way either).

No, historically the opposition party does better when the government appears to have fucked up:   1945 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background context: WWII coming to an end, the country was war exhausted and now needed an opportunity to rebuild. 1951 - Labour kicked out in favour of Tories. Background context: Labour were experiencing factional infighting at the time. Also perceived mishaps due to the handling of crises in the Middle East. Admittedly economy faltered due to us getting involved in the Korean War.  1964 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background Context: despite 10 years of economy buoyancy, the economy started faltering in 1961. Government ministers were getting involved in sex scandals, and a bad choice of Tory leader cemented their doom. 1970 - Labour kicked out in favour of Tory. Background Context: Although the economy suffered in this period, it actually started picking up toward the election. However Labour had bad relations with the industry, and the rejection by France to let the UK into the Common Market was seen as a failure. The devaluation crisis was particularly bad. 1974 - Tory kicked out in favour of a (minority) Labour (our infamous previous example of a hung parliament). Background context: The country was actually in economic crisis due to the 1973-74 stock market crash. Combined with the 73 oil crisis, the miner's strikes, the three-day week electricity emergency - the Tory government had been an absolute disaster. 1979 - Labour kicked out in favour of Thatcher. Background Context: Winter Industrial disputes and strikes in 78-79, a 'failed' Scottish devolution referendum, and having failed a vote of no confidence vote. 1997 - Tories kicked out in favour of Labour. Background Context: John Major's disastrous run. Conservatives breaking out into infighting, a series of scandals, Black Wednesday.   tl;dr Who people vote for isn't the result of our economic status, but rather that the people vote the status quo until the status quo no longer works."

LabourUK,3bj2re,ProfessorZ00M,14,Mon Jun 29 17:13:02 2015 UTC,Can't believe Miliband let the Tories control the narrative on the economy. That did more harm than any bacon sandwich or perceived left-wingery.
LabourUK,3bj2re,tusksrus,7,Mon Jun 29 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. While Labour's relaxed regulation of the banks certainly contributed to the magnitude of the recession, the recession happened as a result of what happened in the states with the Lehman brothers. Labour's high spending during those periods has paid off in infrastructure, education and healthcare. I highly doubt the conservatives would have had tougher regulations on the banks.   The whole argument that Labour are somehow responsible for being so economically intwined with the states that their recession bounced onto us is absurd. Chuka is just caving to the conservative mantra of blaming the past Labour government to seem responsible. It's clever; most Brits do think that Labour were responsible. Although, I think we should be honest and challenge that accusation, rather than pandering to it and passively accepting the blame."
LabourUK,3bj2re,Zephine,2,Tue Jun 30 02:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's caving at all. He's advising a tiny tweak to the narrative, just as Cameron did with the Thatcher narrative ('There is such a thing as society but it's not the same as the state'). In Chuka's case, the argument is: 'We should have invested; we should have bailed out the banks; the Tories shouldn't have attempted rapid deficit reduction; BUT, yeah, we shouldn't have run that deficit'. It's not quite as pithy as Cameron's line (but we can work on that) but it basically agrees with the electorate on ONE point, so that we can actually get elected again and start helping people."
LabourUK,3bj2re,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:43:12 2015 UTC,"Chuka says in regard to the assertion that    it was not profligacy on the part of the last Labour government that caused the crash, but a banking crisis   that   the harsh political reality is that the electorate rejected this.   Which I don't think is true, because it isn't what the Labour leadership articulated during the campaign. I can't think of one occasion where a senior Labour figure articulated this narrative. Also, it suggests he wants to abandon this whole argument, not just admit that Labour should not have run a small deficit for a few years. That's what makes it a cave-in, not just a tweak."

LabourUK,3bi4ia,CymruLegend,5,Mon Jun 29 12:57:50 2015 UTC,"She's rated because of her successful payday loans campaign.   During that dreadful summer of 2013, when Miliband disappeared, she was the only Labour voice all summer. And she succeeded in making Osborne tighten the rules.

LabourUK,3bi4ia,aenor,2,Mon Jun 29 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"I like her for a few other reasons too:   She's not afraid to step away from the party line. She will speak from principles and core beliefs rather than the daily talking points memo.   I also heard her say ""I really don't know much about that area of policy, so I shouldn't comment on it"" to a journalist (might have been Andrew Neil?). That gets an awful lot of credit from me, ""I don't know"" is an acceptable answer, and a lot of times it's better than parroting the spin.   She is, by all accounts, an excellent constituency MP. She seems to genuinely care about her constituents, and helps them in whatever way she can. This doesn't say much about her qualities as a deputy leader, but it's a reason I like her as an MP."

The split does highlight Labour's current identity crisis now, but also presents an opportunity as it means Labour can effectively lean either way and gain support. It highlights that the question isn't whether Labour should be left-wing or right-wing but rather just to work out what it stands for and stick by it."

Better go Green') we're missing the point entirely. What matters is narrative and credibility. There's no point in telling the electorate they were wrong not to elect us in 2015: We have to quietly accept that they basically had a point and construct a narrative that appears credible. Most people will have absolutely no opinion on whether we were too left wing or too right wing, but they will have an opinion on whether we 'seemed believable' or 'knew what we stood for': That's how we win."

How many people have to say ""The reason I didn't vote Labour is because it seemed like they had no principles and ultimately just following in the shadow of the Tories"" before anyone in Labour listens?  Yes, people want a party that stands by sensible policies, but they aren't going to be willing to break the status quo for a party with no overarching principles...  Whilst Tory ideology is rooted in overarching principles and values, Labour ideology seems to be rooted solely in ""well this seems like something that voters might want"".

But considering we've had Red Ed leadership for the last 5 years, not sure how you can blame ""Blue Labour"" for electoral failure.   Again, I ask you to stop calling labour supporters 'tory' and stop calling them 'blue labour. I don't call you 'communists' or a 'stalinists' just because we disagree on policy.  It's not Tory (or Blue Labour) to suggest we need to be economically credible. On the contrary, it's the reason we were rejected by the electorate. We need to get this right. This will take tough decisions.  Whilst we weren't to blame for the economic crisis, the Tories had a better idea than us on how to fix it. As a starter we should support the governments position on balancing the books — eliminating the deficit. We should push the Tories hard on this and hold them to it. Then and only then will we have the credibility to start question government spending changes in all areas. Only then can will we have the authority to challenge their state cutting agenda."

The Tory economic position is considered the ""credible"" position by the electorate because they were much more effective than Labour in articulating their position. It's just not the case that ""the Tories had a better idea than us on how to fix (the economic crisis)"". A significant majority of professional economists disagreed with austerity. Worrying about what is a historically pretty low deficit at a time of economic weakness makes no sense."
LabourUK,3bfw0g,gamas,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"stop calling them 'blue labour.    I'm not exactly using a slur here, it is an established political grouping in the party   Blue Labour advocates the belief that working class voters will be won back to Labour through socially conservative ideas on certain social and international issues, such as immigration, crime and the European Union,[4] a rejection of neoliberal economics[5] in favour of ideas from guild socialism and continental corporatism,[6] and a switch to local and democratic community management and provision of services,[7] rather than relying on a traditional welfare state that is seen as excessively bureaucratic.[8]   The key is in the first statement: ""advocates the belief that working class voters will be won back to Labour through socially conservative ideas"" - i.e. ""let's not actually hold these ideas because we believe in them, let's just do it because it's more likely to win us votes"".  Whilst Ed was more left-wing than Blair and Kendall, most of the things he supported that got him elected as leader got watered down due to the amount of pressure he got from the right of the party. This led to an election campaign that was perpetually confused - being tough on immigration whilst maybe possibly being okay with it, the talk of bringing rail back into public hands that got him some support completely disappeared, replaced with this half-arsed utility bill freeze.  The reality is that Ed being too left/right wing wasn't the issue in the general election. The issue was that Labour didn't really stand for anything, like it was very much like ""well we oppose the Tory cuts, but we're going to cut things, though do it nicer"". Even though I voted Labour, I didn't really feel strongly about it. If someone were to ask me what Labour's main message was in the last election, I honestly couldn't tell you.  Whilst pragmatism is necessary to rule a country, a party needs a strong principled message if it is to get votes - it needs to be able to show why we should vote them rather than stick with the government we already have. I don't think Liz Kendall can offer that because no-one can really see how a party under her stands out against the Tories.  EDIT: Essentially the only way a Kendall Labour would get elected in 2020 is if the Tories manage to enact a repeat of the 1992-1997 government and fuck up so badly that people would rather have anybody else..."

Given that his voters seem most likely to give second preferences to Burnham and Burnham's already the frontrunner, I don't see how he could leapfrog Burnham in either the first or second round. Also, consider how unlikely it is that Corbyn will get second prefs from any of the other three and it becomes apparent that he's not going to get anywhere.  Even among people who are sympathetic to his policies, there's a general recognition that he cannot win (apart from among people who refuse to accept the 2015 election result) EDIT: and so they won't vote for him even if they do like him.  EDIT: Also, the union support doesn't mean what it used to because a) the RMT and FBU are no longer affiliates and b) the unions have so far been very unsuccessful at getting their members signed up to vote, no longer have a bloc vote (that's long gone, obviously) and can't even stuff envelopes full of their chosen candidates' campaign literature anymore."

Now I know that Abbott and Corbyn are different kettles of fish, but the principle stands- there would need to be a great big whack of entryists, and the Tory Party really is surprisingly small in numbers these days.

What she has in common with Blair is a conviction that, in order to win, we must concede ground to the electorate (note: not the Conservative Party) without compromising our key missions as a party.  Many people agree that the most important role for the party right now is to tackle inequality, and here Liz sets out one possible way of doing so.  Hence, she's willing to concede ground on (e.g.) defence spending and immigration, even the size of the state but only insofar as those have very little do with tackling poverty and inequality.  You may not like any of the above (as you can see from my flair, I'm backing Yvette) but it does not 'make her a Tory'!"

She also doesn't show a lot of opposition to clearly damaging policies, notably including her obsession with supporting Conservative views on the economy, defence and the state as a whole.

That simply doesn't wash in places like the south Wales valleys where most are working-class and have traditional views. Many of these people feel excluded from Labour and that was a real weakness of Miliband's leadership (and doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon).

If that's the case, then the real problem is that those MPs are just not getting promoted, they are languishing on the backbenches. The ""face"" of Labour will always be it's cabinet or shadow cabinet, but if the only people who get those jobs are London metropolitan types, then that is the image that attaches to the party.  I think a similar thing is going on in Northern England - there is a lot of talk about the UKIP threat, but there was one Lab MP who saw them off easily. Simon Danczuk took Rochdale off the LibDems in 2010 - and then increased his vote by 10% in 2015.  But there is zero chance of Danczuk getting off the backbenches either, no matter how much his constituents like him. His version of white-van-man-Labour, with his northern working class wife, makes the London spadocracy uncomfortable.  I don't know what any of us can do about this (the promotion of non-spads to the front benches).  Is there any particular Labour welsh MP who you think has a lot of potential that we can get behind and help promote (tweet his stuff, just generally talk about him to raise his profile)?"

From the new batch of MPs I'd take a look at Jo Stevens of Cardiff Central (@JoStevensLabour) - state educated, non-Oxbridge uni and former Trade Union solicitor. Solid left-wing credentials which she is already showing in Parliament. Kevin Brennan and Owen Smith have also impressed me but they're both in various shadow positions.  I agree with the point about Danczuk - I don't agree with everything he says, but he's on the frontline against UKIP and has run rings around them.

I would love to say the only people who would benefit from us leaving the EU would be the richest but even they will suffer as a result... it would just give people on the far right more of an opportunity to erode workers rights, and divide society.  It is really disappointing (although not unexpected) that a union representing working class people are supporting an EU exit. :-("

In a way it's a great pity she didn't run in 2010 - she'd have won easily then and wouldn't have as much baggage either. And we might have been looking at a Labour govt."

I think she did a good job as shadow home secretary, at least from what I saw from her. But yes, I think she probably could have won the leadership in 2010."
LabourUK,3b3dta,Ajnin123,2,Thu Jun 25 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"Yvette's baggage is nothing to do with anything she has done. It's entirely Balls. From the minute he became shadow Chancellor he got attacked, and she's now being attacked for ""sounding just like him"".  Miliband made a mistake, he should have given Yvette the shadow chancellor role, but he didn't because he saw her as a rival and the home secretary job was supposed to be a ""graveyard"".   Miliband had an unfortunate way of calculating personal gain at the expense of the party. Another example is the way he siphoned off Lab activists to attack Clegg in Sheffield Hallam, leaving Labour MPs in the area like Balls unsupported. That had a double bad effect. Lab MP's lost their seats and because the LibDems diverted money to defend Clegg, it enabled the Conservatives to rout them in the south-west. As you can tell I think Miliband was the worst leader that Lab has had in decades. He even messed up the Scottish ref and had to be bailed out by Gordon Brown.  Anyway, back on topic, the contest is between Yvette and Liz for me. Yvette is the more intelligent candidate, and she has a family so knows what people are going through, plus a record of handling her job without mistakes.   But Liz has the advantage of being very hard for the Tories to attack. The press have gone all in for her because a) they like her and b) they think it's safe to support her as she won't win (so they have a brief window of saying something they actually believe in before they go back to supporting Cameron). If she did win though, it would be very hard for them to turn round and attack her, all their own articles praising her would be thrown back in their face. We would be able to say, why are you supporting Cameron and not Liz."

In fact I remember a meme where Osborne was called a ""towel folder"" - and that didn't make any impact at all.  Osborne was rescued by the 2013 compensation payments for PPI - it was like a tsunami of money going from banks to consumers, and had the same impact on the economy that giving people one of those periodic tax bonuses the Americans are so fond of (for example when the financial crisis hit, Bush and then Obama actually mailed cheques to people to stimulate the economy - they got criticised because predictably some people went out and spent it on porn and gambling, but the overall effect was a stimulus). Osborne got lucky because the retail banks essentially did that job for him - I think the total amount was about £36 bn, with £14bn being released in 2013 and £22bn in 2014. Those are huge sums - no wonder the economy recovered!  But voters gave Osborne the credit even though he did nothing."

The next election will be won in England.  P.S. The SNP arn't really socialists no matter what you've been told. ""Socialists"" don't freeze council tax for seven years making it extremely hard for councils to do their statutory duty of care for poor people. Council tax has been rising by 2% p.a. in Tory England, which makes the Tories more socialist than the SNP!  Socialists don't cut 140,000 teachers in order to pay for tuition fees for public school kids either. Did you know that more poor kids in England get to University than in Scotland? That's because in England teaching is still fully funded, which means the child has a chance of getting the grades to enter university. The SNP are rationing their university bill by ensuring the poor in Scotland fail their exams. That's not socialist either.  So Liz Kendal was right to criticise them."
LabourUK,3b3dta,rappersdo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"140,000 teachers? I think you've mixed up your facts there a bit. Even the figures you're quoting say it's 140,000 college places and 4000 teachers.   And fighting against austerity, keeping higher education free, caring about global warming, free prescriptions, fighting against nuclear weapons etc, all are left wing policies, not divisive nationalism."
LabourUK,3b3dta,Ajnin123,5,Thu Jun 25 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"What gave you the idea that fighting against nuclear weapons and free prescriptions are ""left wing policies""?  Did you know that it was Attlee that gave us our nuclear weapon? And that he put up prescription charges to pay to help defend Greece?  The true test of a left-winger is that they would never sacrifice a poor person's need for relief to pander to the middle classes. But that's exactly what the SNP has done. Ruined the lives of Scottish school kids who can't get the quals to go to university to pay for the university of all those public school kids in Edinburgh (I understand that a massive 25% of Edinburgh school kids have private education - do they sound like people who need a subsidy at the public purse at the expense of a poor kid getting their grades?) Rationing college places by cutting them so massively only helps those public school kids who get special teaching and nab all the places.  Freezing council tax is something else a left-winger wouldn't do. Councils have a duty to house the most vulnerable - battered women, people made suddenly homeless etc. They can't do that if you freeze council tax for seven years to pander to wealthy home-owners!  Basically the SNP simply don't care - they've hurt Scotland and then pretend it's all Westminsters fault. Anyone can call themselves socialist and they will if it persuades people to vote blindly for them - but you really ought to judge by how they treat the most vulnerable in society - and they are doing worse there than the Conservatives are. That's some achievement."

Your info on the SNP is ridiculously biased and plain bullshit. Why do you think the poor vote snp? Do you think they're too stupid to understand how these policies affect them?
LabourUK,3b3dta,Ajnin123,5,Thu Jun 25 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"It's definitely left wing to care about the poor innocents in other countries.   Does that make Cameron left-wing because he's maintained International aid?   And it's definitely left wing to make sure people aren't put off getting medicine because it costs too much   The current system provides prescriptions free to the vulnerable. The SNP are providing them to people who can afford them and cutting benefits for the vulnerable to pay for it. They sure haven't raised tax to make up the money, even though they've had tax raising powers for 15 years.   Why do you think the poor vote snp?   Because they got tricked? The defining piece of chicanery during the referendum was Salmond saying ""“Even with a cautious estimate of prices remaining at $113 a barrel being used, it’s clear that Scottish oil and gas could generate more revenues than has previously been assumed.”"" And then claimed he could get three times more than the official estimate.  That's why they voted for him - vulnerable desperate people being told they would be Rich, Rich! And the only people standing in their way was evil Labour and Westminster.  Here's the article on his oil announcement with his outlandish claims:  http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/salmond-scotland-s-oil-boom-to-bring-billions-1-2829902  He was predicting revenues of between £41bn and £57bn, despite the Norwegians warning (in that article) that they thought prices would fall below $100 a barrel.  The forecast is now for £2.1bn. see  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-33100374  That's a staggering 94% drop  Either Alex Salmond is a complete idiot or he was engaged in outright trickery to con desperate people into voting for their own destitution. Because how do you make up that kind of shortfall in money in a country with just 5 million people. Deep savage cuts. He knew that - but persisted in the fibs. No real ""socialist"" would do that - but a nationalist would justify it as a price worth paying.  This whole argument illustrates why Labour would do well to just write off Scotland for a decade and not waste any more resources there. Because people like you who have voted for the SNP are still deeply invested in them. Here you are on a Labour sub wanting us to tell you that you did the right thing voting against Labour for those nationalists. And you are getting angry when we point out that you made a mistake and furious at candidates who point out home truths about the SNP.  You want us to say, yeah, it's socialist to freeze council tax and trick vulnerable people with implausible dreams of extreme riches in order to get them to vote in a manner that is not in their interets.  Well it's not socialist, and it's not right. But us telling you, this soon after the event, won't sink in, you need to find it out for yourself and that will take at least a decade before you acknowledge things to yourself.

The SNP lied and lied wickedly over the referendum - but that's ok, because they're special, right? They should be treated the same as Clegg - he did it on a much more minor point (and tuition fees is minor compared to the lie over the oil)  I think SNP voters have drunk the kool-aid which is why they refuse to give Labour credit for saving Scotland over the referendum, are swallowing the SNP lies and all the contrary things they say.  But as I said, we can't tell you - you need to figure it out for yourself. And that will take time.

The reality is countering the ""Vote Labour get Scottish hegemony"" which will be nixed entirely by an English Labour party.  This is the first really good idea to come out of anyone in Labour since the election!"

They might know about appearances some of the candidates are making in your area through the Regionals or other bodies that aren't otherwise available.

Both the MPs I've had in my constituency have been very good about attending General Committee (GC) meetings, which any member of the party can attend, and speaking to us and answering our questions.

I voted Labour rather than Green though because my local candidate was vehemently anti-austerity and anti-Trident. Sadly, he didn't win. What kind of policies might convince you to vote Labour again?"
LabourUK,3ay5ms,aenor,2,Wed Jun 24 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well I'll be moving from scotland to London soon, so I will be voting labour no matter what, but obviously there are changes Id like to see. (I won't ever vote green until they change their policy on nuclear power and GMOs.)  If I were running as Labour leader in 2020 Id be working on a broad church strategy. It would be 70% pro-business blairite centre, to win back the middle from the Tories (aim for 30 seats stolen, thus +30 us -30 them = 60 seats closer) but also throw in three very left policies to secure the base and win back 30 SNP seats and a half million votes from the Greens (probably huge nuclear power & renewable commitment with a target of fossil fuel free by 2050/60; renationalisation of the rails; referendum on marijuana). Finally, Id focus on jobs jobs jobs, both to win the Tory-lite centrists, but also the blue collar millions who voted UKIP, especially targeting the north of England, and come up with a town-redevelopment scheme for the hundreds of abandoned and dying costal towns.   The marijuana one might initially come across as too extreme, however, I believe that it will be the next gay marriage for progressive countries. Beyond that it is the promise of a referendum, not a straight legalisation - no one can argue against giving the people a say, and if we can get the Daily Mail in favour of it from a ""stop the nanny state"" angle, it's sure to pass (we already have the greens, lib dems and ukip all kind-of favouring it). Finally, it is important because labour only got 9m votes, compared to 10m non-voters; if we truly promise something exciting and radical, we might get up to a million non-voters on  our side.   I'd love to hear criticism of my plan if you have any :)"
LabourUK,3ay5ms,zikalify,2,Wed Jun 24 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Aren't the SNP also against nuclear power and GMOs? But yes, I don't agree with the opposition to nuclear power and GMOs. I will always favour other forms of renewable energy over nuclear power, and I do understand the environmental concerns with nuclear power, but I don't think those concerns are as serious as the threat of further greenhouse gas emissions.  I mostly agree with that plan. I'm just curious as to what your centre policies might be. I'm in favour of lowering corporation tax for small businesses and lowering VAT. These may even help to encourage more small businesses to pay the living wage.   I would, however, want to increase corporation tax for larger businesses to around 21% (it's 20% for all right now, I think). I would also drop the special rate for 'ring fence' companies, which for some reason lowers corporation tax for companies which profit from ""oil extraction or oil rights."" Instead, I'd give that status to companies in the renewable energy sector (or perhaps an other area too).   I like the idea for a referendum on marijuana, though I think the next government should legislate to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of drugs regardless of whether marijuana is legalised for sale. That's the system that Amsterdam has and it seems fairly effective. I've only heard good things so far from Colorado and Washington, too.   I certainly agree with the town regeneration scheme. I think the renewable/green sector could be hugely beneficial for coastal towns, with both the prospect of off-shore wind farms and tidal power.  As for my other ideas, I really want to see devolution for the English regions. I don't mean what this government is promising with its fairly meagre plans of Mancunian devolution, rather I want to see assemblies or parliaments for the north, midlands, and south of England (at least). (London already has its own assembly so they wouldn't be part of the southern parliament, but could have some more powers devolved to them potentially). Maybe it sounds excessive, but it's only the same as what Germany has. Finally, I'd like to see us drop first-past-the-post and reform the House of Lords, but I wouldn't really campaign on the latter as most people don't seem to be too worried about that."
LabourUK,3ay5ms,aenor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm liable to forget what you said as I write this comment so hopefully I don't forget anything major :p   I'll start with the House of Lords. I used to be in favour of replacing it, but recently I've seen its value, especially on the drugs issue against the current govt. I think it's one of those odd things of reality vs theory. In theory, it should suck, as should our monarchy, and the U.S. form of democracy should be an ideal form of govt (the constitution is amazing legal work). However, in reality the HoL and monarchy function pretty damn well here, and the U.S. Democracy really doesn't. I would kick out the bishops, but overall, I think it's mostly okay.   Second, the SNP. I don't know about GMOs, but yes they are against nuclear. I can accept this, because the major flaw in renewable energy is that it can't deal with demand when the population/ area ratio is too small. In scotland, they have a large area and a small population, so they could go 100% renewable (like sweden or Norway's situation) and so it's fine not to have nuclear. However, as climate change is a global issue, it is important to recognise that many countries are too dense to be powered by renewables, so nuclear is necessary. I accept the SNP saying nuclear is wrong for scotland, but I don't accept people saying it is unsafe and shouldn't be used.   Finally, what pro business Things I would like. I am suggesting a large scale investment in technology jobs, focused in the north of England (and maybe a little scotland). The industries I want to see are nuclear R&D, renewable R&D, electric cars R&D plus their manufacturing, and finally a big state owned pharmaceutical, to sell abroad, to lower what the NHS spends on drugs, and to create biochem jobs, as many of biochem grads do not go on to do biochem work, which is a huge waste of resources.   I would also generally favour increases in our manufacturing sector."
LabourUK,3ay5ms,zikalify,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:39:39 2015 UTC,No credible Labour leader will give up Trident.  You only have to look at Ukraine and see what happens to you when you give up your nukes.  Even the SNP are contorting themselves on the issue - their latest wheeze is to say they want to join NATO and be the beneficiary of nukes even if they've got rid of them themselves. The SNP really are bludgers.
LabourUK,3ay5ms,aenor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I can accept that giving up Trident may be seen as quite a populist stance.   But even if Ukraine did still have nuclear weapons, surely they would never have used them? I just can't envisage any scenario in which nuclear weapons would seem like the most wise policy to pursue, and thus I don't really see how they act as much of a deterrent. Anyway, the UK is not Ukraine - we have no antagonistic neighbours and we do still spend far more than Ukraine does on our military.  I'm a bit confused as to why the SNP really want to be in NATO, if I'm honest. They've got some oil, yes, but other than that there doesn't seem to be much that any country would really want to attack Scotland over. There are quite a few countries in Europe which aren't in NATO anyway.  Of course, I'm no expert in foreign policy. I'll continue to oppose Trident, but I accept that it's not likely to be the biggest issue for the 2020 general election, so that could be why only Jeremy is opposing it."
LabourUK,3ay5ms,zikalify,2,Thu Jun 25 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"if Ukraine did still have nuclear weapons, surely they would never have used them?   The deterrance thing works because you are never quite sure what the other side will do - who can predict who will be PM in 50 years? So people become super-cautious when nukes are around. Look at India and Pakistan and how the number of skirmishes has dropped...  As for ""antagonistic neighbours"" - we are being bombarded by Russian planes at the moment coming in from the north (across the arctic), they are closer to us than the Americans are. At the moment it's just harassment - they want to make RAF planes scramble over and over - and perhaps map our response. If there was no nukes in Britain and France and no American presence in Germany and Eastern Europe, our safe world wouldn't be so safe.  SNP's sudden conversion to NATO is because of those Russian planes in Scottish airspace which has made them suddenly rethink their position. If they were a NATO member, England would be obliged to come to the defence of an independent Scotland. Nice work if you can get it - make lots of anti-war noise to get people to vote for you, don't spend on defence, rely on someone else to do the spending and defending. The SNP are bloody charlatans."

But I still don't understand what would ever be the point of firing nuclear weapons. Why would they act any more cautiously when they surely know that we would never use them, as it would lead to significant human and economic consequences? Wouldn't it be better to build up deterrents and defences with weapons that we would actually be willing to use?   When did the SNP switch to supporting NATO? (Sorry, it sounds like I'm asking loads of questions and possible being aggressive, but I'm just curious.) As far as I can remember they wanted to remain in NATO during the independence campaign and had planned to do so in the 'Scotland's Future' white paper. Though it did propose removing Trident, so would removing Trident have taken them out of NATO?   Sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions!"

Debate about the HRA vs Bill of Rights is only about what we let happen before it gets that far.  If in theory you simply scrapped the HRA today (but remained in the ECHR), all you'd achieve is that you'd prevent British judges from deciding cases, and instead push 100% of human rights cases to the ECtHR- the exact opposite of ""giving us greater say over our own laws""."

I think the problem for a lot of these people is that they keep being told that immigration is great, nothing wrong with it, but at the same time that the country has huge debt, housing, health and education are being squeezed, people are demonised for not being as motivated, able bodied, skilled and willing to work for as cheap as immigrants/migrants. Then there's how communities have definitely changed. There are areas where you walk down with all of the open air stalls, sari shops, mosques, the sight of lots of Muslims, Orthodox Jews or whatever. People are afraid of that show of culture and difference. Workers bring their families with them or send money home, claim tax credits, etc., so people are suspicious of the idea that they really do put in more than they take out.. maybe more so over generations rather than the initial people. Don't discount the factor of envy if they see immigrants doing better than themselves.  Anecdote here but an American acquaintance is at Glasgow doing a masters and they keep asking me 'why are there so many beggars from India'? To which I feel uncomfortable and have no answer not least of all because they aren't even Indian half the time. It doesn't come across as positive immigration to have people coming in to be beggars.   Even I don't really buy into it. I think that we should be mindful of population growth and how bad it is for the country (overcrowding, less resources to go around) and the environment."
LabourUK,3apgcy,InBluePain,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"I can tell Tom Watson why, it's because of immigration.  Immigration shouldn't really be put down as this major, hyped up problem that the media makes it out to be.  But Labour does need to start listening to the electorate in-order to make gains in 2020.  It's that and EU taking a lot of powers away from us, the EU needs reform.  I'm sure many people who supported UKIP in the GE are not racist, I actually doubt many of them have racial tendencies at all but I do see where they are coming from, their communities are changing at a vast rate, losing a sense of their selves and you also have people who abuse the welfare state (this isn't of course everyone, just some and even then I'm sure it's the few and not many).  I understand why migrants come here too, it's to escape their awfully corrupt countries and to escape in the worse case: death -- it's fair to let them come, but we should also be setting up training programs to help people go into jobs.    You shouldn't live from the welfare state, you should take from it when you are unemployed, but you should try to get back into a job."

To be fair to the others they seem to be preparing for the road ahead and keeping the media appearances to a minimum for the moment. Burnham has already contradicted himself on things he's said a few weeks ago nevermind his own record in government.   I think after Umunna pulled out Burnham realised he could potentially win the leadership on a more right-wing position.  It seems like an age since he released his candidacy announcement going against the 'aspiration' narrative and talking about reaching out to everyone whilst having a sly dig at people talking about John Lewis shoppers.   Now he's trying to pitch himself between Cooper and Kendall, which would appease many of the Blairites/Brownites in the PLP but sounds like the worst of both worlds to a lot of members.   It seems he's caught himself in that Westminster bubble he keeps banging on about."

However I do think a better overall solution is a Land Value Tax and other taxes to be scrapped for it (Inheritance, Stamp Duty, Business rates, council tax and some other taxes are redundant with LVT) and use the Land registry to assess land value. Andy Burnham did say he'd support LVT but I have got a feeling this is not going as a LVT would end up reducing house prices which is politically toxic.  Overall I do think the Labour Party  should look towards Henry Georgist policies rather than looking at Karl Marx in terms of wealth distribution that promotes business and active wealth generation but prevents idle wealth (i.e. shoving money into real estate)."

I've even seen a couple of Tories say that she's good which is slightly bizarre.   Flint - very good media performer, on the Blairite side of things, strong personal story and quite popular with MPs.   Bradshaw - lone Labour seat in a sea of blue so he may be good at understanding swing voters, also Blairite  Tom Watson - a campaigner - went after child abuse and Murdoch. Some worry he is a liability e.g. prone to resignations and a bully. He's popular with Labour members and had the most MP nominations. Murdoch's press may go after him though."

Don't think he'll win but Exeter isn't what I'd consider a typical Labour seat so if he doesn't win I hope we take aboard his ideas and listen to how his CLP campaigns.  Eagle - Not too sure on her and seems to be struggling to make out the general vision behind her deputy bid so far  Flint - like BluePain said, good media performer with a strong personal story but I'm not a big fan of her Blairite side.  Watson - An excellent campaigner, but seems to have a problem with consistency in supporting the leaders and a bit too affiliated with TU's for my liking.  Creasy - Like Watson, a brilliant campaigner, good at media and excellent at a grassroots level. I think her and Bradshaw are my current top 2, Creasy and Bradshaw imo could work together well with Creasy talking about the need to turn more people into members via grassroots recruitment and then Bradshaw showing us how to use those members effectively in swing seats such as Exeter."
LabourUK,3ajxyn,Subotan,8,Sat Jun 20 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea to think about how the candidates will be attacked - but the author was too kind and ""comradely"" (his word!) in his attempt.  Here's my more brutal attempt at spotting weaknesses and lines of attack. I'll start with the one most easily attacked:  Andy Burnham  Scouser. It's unfortunate, but Scousers don't have a good reputation in the rest of Britain. The northerners everyone in the south likes are Geordies, but sadly there arn't any Geordies in this contest.  Also his expenses are horrendous. In the 2008 expenses scandal, Burnham according to the Mail, ""submitted a claim for £16,644 for obtaining and renovating the flat, including £1,845 for a new kitchen. During lengthy negotiations with the fees office, the Labour MP — who later tried to reclaim the cost of a £19.99 bath robe from Ikea — even joked in a letter in December 2005 that he 'might be in line for a divorce' if the expenses were not paid."" It appears that his wife was writing letters to the fees office too (!)   The fees office relented and finally paid him. But instead of learning from the experience of all these details going public, he's offended again.  In 2012 the expenses office changed the rules so that you couldn't claim on a house you had a mortgage on. Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh simply shrugged and remained in the (mortgaged) houses they were in without claiming.  Burnham rented his mortgaged flat out (the one the taxpayer paid to renovate) for £1449 per month and moved to rented accommodation, and claimed rent on that to the tune of £17,000.  The worst thing was his spokesman's response to this:  """"Mr Burnham was forced into this arrangement by a change in the rules. He has received no public subsidy in respect of his flat and the rent he receives only covers his costs. If parliament changed the rules, he would return to his own flat. Any suggestion that he has made money with the help of the public purse is utterly false.""""  Forced? Forced? I doubt any voter would think that (given that Burnham would be earning at least the MP's salary of £65k.  This is not someone who appears to care much about conserving taxpayers hard earned money - which makes it easy to mock anything he says about deficits and cuts (and he's in favour of cuts that fall on other people apparently).  Then there's Mid Staffs. No minister of health is responsible for what goes on in any hospital because none can micromanage to that degree - but he was slow to order an enquiry. It will get brought up any time the NHS is in the news.  Liz Kendall  She's a single woman in her forties. This is an age when people get married - gay marriage, straight marriage, whatever. Just get married! But she hasn't, so what's wrong with her? Too difficult to live with? Too cold?   She isn't even co-habiting with someone of either sex. If she'd been living with someone for the last fifteen years, she'd get a pass (lots of left wing people do that). If she was a single mother she'd get a pass (lots of single mothers in the country nodding along about what cads men are leaving you holding the baby). If she was divorced she'd get a pass too, lots of people in the same situation.  But she's single in her forties with no children. Not many people like that.  What's wrong with her?  Then there's the question of whether she can relate to what people with families go through - it's a cliche but true that no-one really understands this fully till they produce a sprog of their own.  Jeremy Corbyn  Lefty looney who sympathises with nut-jobs in the middle east who want to kill us. Enough said. He's a more likeable George Galloway with as much chance of being Prime Minister  Yvette Cooper  She suffered from ME in her twenties, and this illness tends to recur. So there's a health question over her.  She has managed to have three children and a career as an MP and minister at the same time though, so it appears she's managing her illness. But a bit of Googling reveals that Ed Balls does all the cooking and cleaning in that household. According to Balls, Yvette is a bit ""lastminute.com"" while he's the organised one! (He'd make a great First Dude, but voters might worry he was making other decisions too).     Of all these problems, Yvette's are the easiest to get round. There are literally millions of women in the country who are struggling with illness but trying to hold it together and keep working and looking after their families. If she manages to always put forward a competent face, she'll get a lot of points from women admiring how she's doing it."
LabourUK,3ajxyn,aenor,3,Sun Jun 21 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"Dude, this is a great post, as is the original article. It's uncomfortable of course, but it's the reality of the kind of thing that may happen. I think Kendall was living with that comedian guy for eight years and with a dentist before that so it's not as bad as it might be. I still remember how William Hague and Chuka wheeled out girlfriends when they were going to stand for leader. Not saying that she should do that though - the press did a lot of hint hint about those two.   Yvette I think may be attacked as a Balls puppet and for being part of the previous government a bit more than you think."
LabourUK,3ajxyn,InBluePain,5,Sun Jun 21 10:07:56 2015 UTC,"I should do the following the rest of them but here my view on Jeremy Corbyn.  Do think you're wrong on Liz but half right on Yvette.   Jeremy Corbyn   Left looney lets take a look at what he has supported over the years   Part of the 2001 Stop the War Coalition Backed Plaid Cymru/SNP calls for an inquiry into the war.  Strong anti-poverty advocate Voted against introducing tuition fees and any increase Opposed private finance initiatives Supports renationalisation of railways Supports higher minimum wage Higher rate of tax for the wealthiest and an increased corporate tax rate Campaigner against Apartheid in South Africa Supporter of a United Ireland, inviting Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams to London in 1984, one of the first to speak with Sinn Féin? Amnesty International member Campaigned for the trial of the late former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet Long-time campaigner on animal rights issues Signatory to Michael Meacher's Climate Change Early Day Motion Campaigned against the Gaza–Israel conflict and promotes the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Venezuelan solidarity activist Advocated for the rights of the forcibly-removed Chagossians to return to the British Indian Ocean Territory. Called for dialogue between the UK and Argentine governments on the question of Falkland Island sovereignty One of 16 signatories of an open letter to Ed Miliband asking to oppose further austerity, which was followed up by 80 economists saying it made no sense to support austerity.    Corbyn is a socialist but many successful socialist democracy nations around the world.  Scandinavian falls under this camp and has not fallen off a cliff.  Germany, Holland and many more have been just as successful as the UK but with socialist policies.  Some people may say the UK should not go back to the 50s/60s/70s but they appear to forget that was one of the best periods for the UK also one of the most stable.  Had lower inequality/higher social mobility long list of other things.  We have lost many things which held communities together and done some major damage at a social level.   Don't get me wrong not saying we should pull policy from the 70s or 50s back but we should look at building a system which works for now.  We have a pension system designed in the 50s for 2015 which leaves many poor in old age without support. Work life balance which sucks you dry for years.   Stronger economic case for higher taxes compared to what some people think. No evidence that lower taxes create more growth but they do cost us more in human cost and picking up the pieces.  Bill gates has called on the world to look at business tax again saying it does not stop people investing when rates was higher.  Many other super rich who have called on rethink of taxes around the world.  IF Jeremy corbyn can present the above as looking right wing and counter any attacks. He could be the real alternative and something the Tories fear. Problem is as the above post proves many people view him as a left loony if you look at the reality history is going to judge him as being correct on so many points.  Would say that real loonies are the ones who have been moved the UK into a worse direction and won't look at the alternatives or have the balls to challenge it.   End of the day most of the public supports what Jeremy corbyn stands for. Problem is making sure his message gets out and he can defend his message.   Labour lost due to failing to define the future and defend the past.  Also lost due to failing to turn Labour into a movement and making the grass roots weaker.   And not that old you most likely won't be believe it when I say that."

Smart lab candidates should just wash their hands off the whole sorry mess in the ME - it's not as though Britain can solve anything over there anyway. There are other parts of teh world where people are more needy but not violent and we can focus better on them.  On international aid, we should take the Bill Gates approach - identify places where you can make a real difference because the culture is already favourable and then pile in. For example, he chose Botswana not South Africa to put in his healthcare money, because a) it was non corrupt (lower corruption than many eastern european countries) and b) it already had a rudimentary healthcare set up and his efforts just plugged into it. From his point of view, his money was limited and he wanted the biggest bang for his buck and Botswana meant less waste (through corruption and maladministration) and more lives saved than South Africa.

They have their own agenda, and whether secular or religious, they are anti-democratic because the Koran frowns on democracy.  There are so many other parts of the world however that are much poorer but who are much more receptive to building alliances with us, especially in Southern Africa. But for some reason no-one is interested in doing anything productive with them, instead they want to waste time on banging their heads on the wall in the ME.

If it a party doesn't have principles why does it exist outside of making money. (did i just describe tony blair?)"
LabourUK,3ak0js,Soodings,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think we're just not used to seeing MPs on the left who don't talk in meaningless political rhetoric and stick to their principles. There are some on the right but few prominent characters on the left and we need someone like that. Someone who can say ""this is the right thing to do"" and convince people of it, rather than pander to some Tory idea that Labour are worse for working people than they are (a ridiculous claim if I've ever heard one).  Corbyn may be seen as a ""hard lefty"" but he's nothing more on a left right spectrum than a sensible, principled social democrat and frankly in a party that claims to be social democratic, he should be closer to the centre, not one of the extremes."
LabourUK,3ak0js,thiswasamisatke,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"My support for Corbyn is actually waning. I agree with a lot of his principles (being anti-austerity, anti-Trident, etc.) but I just can't imagine him as being the best person for organising a party or coming up with effective solutions. That's why I'm rooting for Yvette really, even though I've yet to fully grasp what her overall spending plan might be.   I'd be interested to see how many people within the Labour party (and those who voted Labour) actually supported Labour's so-called ""austerity-light"" plan in this election. I have a horrible feeling that the other three candidates might point to the success of the Tories and the fact that 9.3 million people voted for Labour this time round as evidence to support this form of deficit reduction, and thus refuse to adopt an anti-austerity stance. Being anti-austerity shouldn't mean that you're considered to be on the far-left and supporting extreme views, but with Jeremy as the only candidate, I fear that may become the case."

Mrs Balls who cares more about family values, not demonising the poor, and the only one who seems to realise we're in 2015 and the jobs of the future will not be the jobs of the past.   By being ""released"" from her Husband in the Commons, she has completely lost her robotic image in the past month, and honestly seems like the kind of person who can win elections. Corbyn and Kendall will split the party too much imo, and Burnham honestly seems the most wooden out of him and Cooper."
LabourUK,3adv58,Kalissss,5,Fri Jun 19 11:00:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I'm confident she can take apart the current Tory leader and two out of three of the frontrunners to replace him.

LabourUK,3adv58,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Fri Jun 19 11:24:06 2015 UTC,"I think she'll be leader because she's the best candidate. The left-leaning press are definitely looking her way (the Guardian and the New Statesman both had very positive articles in the last 24 hours).  I also think she will tear apart the Tories. She was trying to be a bit mumsy the other night on BBC 2, but she's actually incredibly tough. Can you imagine watching Cameron facing a female opponent smarter than he is, trying not to patronise her or look like a bully? It's going to be great.  I also felt that at the hustings, she was saying things I hadn't heard before. Not necessarily on policy (it's pretty tough to start trying to set policy when you're not leader yet) but when she talked about having been on benefits herself and the frustration and anger of it, that was something I hadn't heard from a politician before. It makes it very hard to throw around 'scrounger' rhetoric when she's in charge.  Anyway, all in all, it's Yvette for me.  EDIT: On the other hand, this is the weirdest photo. She needs to get a different one on her Wikipedia article, quickly."
LabourUK,3adv58,The_Pickle_Boy,6,Fri Jun 19 10:01:46 2015 UTC,Does it matter if she can wreck Cameron 1 vs 1? Miliband did it all the time and it amounted to nothing.

She's right to support certain Tory policies, but she also needs to make clear how she fundamentally differs. I'm very disappointed that she's yet to make that clear."

That's why the decision to have Alan Johnson as the figurehead of the Labour side of things is such a clever move.   Johnson is down to earth, likeable, and a capable media performer.   This is definitely another mark in favour of the pro-EU side, both in that Johnson is a great choice and in that they're clearly taking this very seriously."

That may be unfair and due to right-wing media bias but lets try working in the world as it actually exists rather than how we would like it to be.  I cringe when a Labour politician says something along the lines of ""protecting services like Health and Education that help the people is the most important thing for the Labour Party..."" and so on. Wrong. That's not the most important thing for any Party that ever wants to form a Government, it's the economy.

Implying that one of your fellow candidates cares more about the party than the country serves no purpose other than to get you good headlines which appeal to those who don't vote in this contest. All it's achieved is to give our opponents the opportunity to suggest that Burnham doesn't care about the country. That'll come back to bite us big time if he wins.  Also, on the importance of the economy. That varies in its importance depending on the election. It's a top issue now, but it wasn't in 1997, 2001, or 2005.

You should really be asking yourself whether that's so objectionable. The public do not trust us on immigration (they've been hearing ""Immigration is Good But..."" for over a decade now), and we should really start considering how we can actually design a tougher but fairer immigration system that the public is prepared to accept (eg more legal asylum seekers from Syria esp from vulnerable minorities like Yazidi, Christians and Alawites, in return for coming down hard on illegal migrants at Calais and on the Med).  Likewise on the Tory quotes. Those aspects of the Tory campaign - fiscal responsibility and economic competence - were key messages the public responded to. To me it doesn't make sense that we should observe the Tories winning elections with certain messages and then refuse to steal those messages from them because they've already been used by the Tories, like dirty undies or something.  The ""Progressive Majority"" stuff is a myth. Britain is at present a fundamentally centre-right country. If we want to win again and prevent a third Tory government, then we need to adapt to this climate and make some hard compromises to do so."

Liz Kendall literally said ""Australian style points system."" And then went on to say ""I won't be stealing any Tory or UKIP polices."" She's more Blair than Blair it seems. Labour should not be 'Coming down hard' on anyone, we're supposed to view migrants as humans.

LabourUK,3a6t8j,rappersdo,3,Thu Jun 18 02:05:50 2015 UTC,"Are immigration and the deficit ""Tory messages"" though?  On immigration, Keir Hardie founded teh Labour party to protest at immigrants and the pressures they were putting on the working classes. He did a stonking anti-Lithuanian speech for example, not because he was xenophobic but because uncontrolled immigration was hurting the people who he was representing - their pain was real no matter what the liberal classes thought.  And what was more the fledgling Labour party was successful in putting pressure on the govt of the day to do something about it - the Liberal govt stopped free movement of people and introduced passports for the first time in 1906 in response to the pressure from people like Hardie. (Free movement of people then returned via Margaret Thatcher's single european act, which was signed in 1985 and came into force in 1992 - and hey presto, the working classes are agitating about it again, and flirting with UKIP because Labour appears not to be interested in their woes).  As for deficits and surpluses - in the last 100 years, the Conservatives have presided over just 1 budget surplus in the year 1987/88. Labour managed it five times despite being in power for many fewer years! (48/49, 49/50, 98/99, 99/00, 00/01).  How has it happened that a Labour person can get attacked for saying things that Attlee and Hardie would have agreed with? Are ""traditional supporters"" that far away from the those ideas?   You seem to have an idea that ""labour principles"" must be the opposite of anything a successful Labour leader espoused (so anything Attlee, Hardie, Blair and co did is evil and anything the failures said is good).

I never said immigration wasn't an issue, I just said we've been approaching it wrong, seeing as we don't seem to be able to come up with new ideas of our own and I include the old labour left on that too.  Kendall has once again fallen into the same trap as holding up Australia as the beacon of great immigration policy, rather than the racist, human rights abusing, terrorist-creating shithole it's become under Abbott's premiership.  One principle I would like to see return is clause 4 yes, but other than that I'm just asking people stand by their beliefs, it would make us different from the Tory party.

If I consistently and strongly stood by all of my various beliefs I'd be much more vocal about how dumb and irrational Labour's view of immigration is.

Let's put it another way (and ignore your uncomradely insinuations):  What are you prepared to compromise on in order to make sure that we have a Labour Government?  Personally, I think the things we should compromise on are the things the public actually wants. Some of those things are policies I like - Kendall's relative economic liberalism is something I sympathise with - and others I don't, such as a tougher stance on immigration."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,Subotan,0,Thu Jun 18 08:58:17 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like a tough system at all... the 'though' system of the tories has seen immigration levels go back to the days of New Labour no party is tough on immigration. We've had Miliband and Cameron saying we need to be tougher on immigration for the past 2 years neither with any actual solid policies to deal with it. Kendall will be the same she won't have a policy to deal with it, the main issue that lost Labour voters and she is the same as all the others. The blairites have their heads in the same if they think they can just throw out a less charismatic female version of Tony Blair and expect victory.

LabourUK,3a6t8j,The_Pickle_Boy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm just bouncing an idea out. I suspect people in this country want the Government to have complete control over who is coming in and who is not, but we're a gentle people and I think people might respond to a Government clearly saying we should help a small number of the truly desperate in return for shutting the door on others. It's consistent to say we should help members of those small communities who are literally threatened by extermination from ISIS and then make clear we're not going to help economic migrants coming over by boat from Africa. In other words, an expansion of legal ways to migrate for refugees from specific, small and vulnerable communities in return for zero-tolerance for those entering illegally.  The pseudo-tough rhetoric we've been using for over a decade doesn't work and it never has. We need to start talking about alternatives, and for something as tricky as immigration maybe a solution is being clear about bits of immigration we are liberal on and those we would clamp down on."

Like, I could understanding campaigning for Labour on a Blairite stance, but she literally word-for-word repeated campaign slogans and buzz words that Cameron used in the general election debates. The moment you are quoting and supporting everything your opposition is saying, you may as well just pack up and join the opposition.  Also the ""We need an Australian point-based system so only skilled migrants are let into the country"" is word-for-word a common sentence uttered by Farage.   Honestly, although I'm a Corbyn supporter, if Yvette or Burnham become leader, then I would support the party all the way - I can accept compromise positions, we do need to win an election after all. But if Kendall won, then I could no longer say that I align with the party.  EDIT: I should add, I didn't join the party in May because of Corbyn, I joined it because I felt the Labour Ed stood for was right and shouldn't be lost. The fact that Corbyn came along and presented a platform that is even closer to my ideological views was just a pleasant surprise. Thankfully, the leadership election is ranked so I don't have to worry about giving votes to Liz by voting Corbyn."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,aenor,3,Wed Jun 17 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"""I will stand for hard-working people for working Britain"" Like, I could understanding campaigning for Labour on a Blairite stance, but she literally word-for-word repeated campaign slogans and buzz words that Cameron used in the general election debates.   Did you know that the phrase ""hard-working people"" was originally coined by New Labour?   They used to use it in a left-wing context, as in ""We are introducing tax credits to help hard working families"". They knew Tories would claim that tax credits were ""benefits"" (dread word) so the idea was to emphasize that this was going to ""hard working families"" - i.e. people in work, who were working very hard but weren't making much and needed help. It was a clever way to deflect criticism. Both Blair and Brown used to pepper their speeches with ""hard working familes"" every time they talked about the help they were giving.  The conservatives stole the phrase to make themselves sound more centrist, and they've been so successful in hijacking the language that Labour people now are attacking other Labour people for using a phrase Labour originally coined! Because they now believe it is a ""Cameron campaign slogan"", and if he lifted it, it must be evil! Actually he lifted it because it was successful, a good use of language.  And that final twist just shows what has gone wrong in Labour - this is a party that just attacks itself, and especially attacks everything successful about itself, instead of defending both the ideas and the words and saying to the Tories, ""push off, this is our language, our phrase"". So much for ""I could understand campaigning for Labour on a Blairite stance"" - poor Liz!  P.S. Here's Gordon Brown's 2005 pre-election budget:  http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/mar/16/publicfinances.budget2005  'A budget for hard-working families and pensioners'  Here's an interesting article from 2005 which noted just how much Labour were banging on about ""hard working families"":  http://jackthurston.com/articles/hardworking-families/   The Labour Party will seek to win a third term of office with a claim to be on the side of Britain’s “hard-working families”. The expression “hard-working families” is by now a familiar feature of the political landscape. It peppered Labour’s 2001 election manifesto and was spelt out in giant letters on the stage backdrop at the party’s conference last autumn, dwarfing the delegates standing to address the party faithful. You will find it in speeches and articles by Cabinet ministers, backbench MPs and youthful political wannabes. It even bridges Britain’s great political divide between the Prime Minister and his Chancellor. A Google search of the world wide web reveals 1,409 occurrences of the phrase in conjunction with Tony Blair. Gordon Brown is only marginally behind with 1,110 hits. Lacking any decent catchphrases of their own, the Tories have lately adopted the expression, rather unimaginatively arguing “no, no, no, don’t listen to them, it’s the Conservative Party, not Labour, that’s the real friend of Britain’s hard-working families”.   And it's a very sorry state of affairs that the Conservatives have been so successful in pinching the idea that any New lab person who was working on the 2001 and 2005 manifestos (like Liz Kendall did as a spad at teh time) is being attacked by Labour people for something that was Labour and those same lab people voted for!  The irony is that the Conservatives will cut tax credits (the thing that ""hard-working families"" was coined to help introduce). And they will be aided by the useful idiots on the Labour side who would rather be in opposition than admit that New Labour did anything good (tax credits, building and staffing 149 new hospitals to help increase NHS capacity, giving rights to temporary and part-time workers, oh a million other things that are all now in jeopardy thanks to some Lab people taking a holier-than-thou attitude to New Labour)."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Thu Jun 18 01:59:45 2015 UTC,"tax credits, building and staffing 149 new hospitals to help increase NHS capacity, giving rights to temporary and part-time workers, oh a million other things that are all now in jeopardy thanks to some Lab people taking a holier-than-thou attitude to New Labour)   Don't forget excellent grants for working class people to go to uni, not headline-grabbing fee cuts that destroy the education system and prevent working class people from achieving good grades (like the good ole, left-wing SNP we should be emulating if we want to win back 'traditional voters')."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,Ajnin123,2,Thu Jun 18 08:11:21 2015 UTC,Same. Kendell isn't really aware that the Green and SNP Party exist - maybe even spoilt ballots and non voting for some. What's the point of being in opposition when you agree on virtually every point? Accepting the Conservative position on every stance is just going to push both the Labour and Conservative party further right. Even the Lib Dems could go left of Labour with Tim Farron.
LabourUK,3a6t8j,Subotan,2,Wed Jun 17 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"What's the point of being in opposition when you agree on virtually every point?   Is that really the case? I see Kendall snatching the bits of the Tory campaign which resonated with people because they were popular policies. Objecting to a budget surplus in statute is a big difference between her and the Tories, for example.   Same. Kendall isn't really aware that the Green and SNP Party exist   Pff, the Greens aren't a strategic threat to Labour, whilst the SNP's rise has very little to do with the policies of Labour (Miliband's Labour was the most left wing since Kinnock's is the most crucial point here) and everything to do with Scottish nationalism and longer term problems of Scottish Labour."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,JustAhobbyish,3,Wed Jun 17 22:53:58 2015 UTC,I agree and think Corbyn did good also.  Liz has noticed blair but forget why he was a success.  What I mean by that she understands in order to win you need to sound like something old but bundle in something new.  But fails to do any of the above correctly...
LabourUK,3a6t8j,jylg,3,Wed Jun 17 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"I really warmed to Liz Kendall, despite disagreeing with a lot she said I think she would be capabel of winning an election and giving Cameron hell.  Jeremy will be my first choice because I am a complete and utter socialist at heart and he really does offer something different. The only thing he has to be careful of is being painted as ""pro immigration."" We all get that there are bigger issues like housing, undercutting wages etc. But do the hoards of Daily Mail,Express and Sum readers get that?  If I took my socialist hat off it would be between Liz Kendal and Yvette, both are really strong characters, but I think Liz (based on tonight's performance) has the capacity to go on and win.  The host was abysmal, she didn't let any of them answer the question and put words into peoples mouths.  Not the most coherent response but its almost 2am and I need sleep!"

Let's see how well she does in the coming months.  Corbyn: impressive, does need to iron out what he will do for immigration however. Needs to be careful, embracing immigration is fair and he is right but, he needs to make sure he expresses to clamp down on illegal immigration.  Also, he's anti-war, fair enough. How will he approach the situation in the Middle East with ISIL?  You cannot negotiate with these people, you have to use force.   Cooper won this, even though I like Corbyn."

LabourUK,3a6t8j,InBluePain,2,Thu Jun 18 06:53:42 2015 UTC,"Overall verdict: disappointing, not good.   Burnham - tired and uninspiring. He came last in the last leadership contest aside from Abbott didn't he. But he is inoffensive and this probably means it benefits him most which is just terrible for Labour.  Kendall - Really, really, really needs to define how she is different to the Tories and offer something new policy-wise that the Tories don't have (and devolution isn't what people especially care about). Maybe tone down the school teacher vibe. Upside: sharp and gets that Labour needs to appeal to people other than its diehard supporters - 'the country comes first'.   Corbyn - honest and likeable, appealing, but fear that his immigration policies won't appeal to the country. Still gets my second place vote.   Cooper - I like her personal story and standing up for people who need welfare, I like that she makes the point that it was the banks and not over-spending that caused the deficit BUT what different is she offering? Is she offering bank reform for example? (no) Still comes across as too 'machine politics' and Brownite."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,rappersdo,4,Thu Jun 18 09:13:39 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:    Why is Liz Kendall in this party? She's just spewing the same old shit we've heard from the Tories and UKIP but then acting like she's one of us. Burnham actually started his opening statement in the exact same way he announced his intent to stand, pretty much sums up how shit he was, an absolute bore Cooper did pretty well, but wasn't that memorable. There were some right twats in the audience."
LabourUK,3a6t8j,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Thu Jun 18 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"I liked Yvette and Liz. Jeremy didn't sound convincing at all. Andy did okay but talked over other people too much.  Also, agree with everyone that wossname was not a good host. She kept paraphrasing the audience's questions, changing the meaning, and then insisting that the candidates hadn't answered the question which she had just made up."
LabourUK,3a7i3t,JustAhobbyish,3,Wed Jun 17 20:56:33 2015 UTC,My local CLP has a deal with the Green party to stand in areas in which they can win not to fight us in areas we normally win.  This is due to how the voting system works right now so maybe she has a point.  If we do the same with the Lib Dems who knows what the result could be.
LabourUK,3a7i3t,Ajnin123,2,Thu Jun 18 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. There's no point in our FPTP system to let in a government which hasn't got a popular mandate. The sooner we get Labour in with a pact with a minor party, the quicker we can get electoral reform on our priorities."

LabourUK,3a6s1i,Cavernwight,6,Wed Jun 17 17:53:08 2015 UTC,Think we need to look at why people don't stand to start with instead of just short lists.  So what is holding people back from coming forward. Short lists are a short fix for a long term problem we have enough people from all groups but they are not moving up why is that.
LabourUK,3a6s1i,JustAhobbyish,2,Wed Jun 17 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"Because there aren't enough role models/certain groups are still prejudiced against. I agree AWS should be short-term, but only up to a point where they're truly not needed."
LabourUK,3a6s1i,JustAhobbyish,3,Wed Jun 17 21:15:43 2015 UTC,We should also look at the costs of running along with the time required ;)  More than one reason at play here which makes the problem even harder to solve.
LabourUK,3a6s1i,jylg,4,Wed Jun 17 22:40:31 2015 UTC,I think also you have to look at the fact that politics is not an easy thing to get into... local government is a prime example.. you have to be a pretty hard character because you get absolutely no support as a councillor and you have to work your ass off.   It is very challenging to hold down a full time job/raise a family as a local politician.  But getting up there and saying to the public we need to invest more in politicians so we can attract people from all backgrounds is not going to be a popular thing to do!
LabourUK,3a6s1i,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Thu Jun 18 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"Look what happens in other parties -- or any walk of life -- when they 'judge people purely on merit'. Strangely, you end up with lots and lots of rich, white, heterosexual, cisgendered, able-bodied people in all the leadership roles.  I myself fall into all of those categories, incidentally: Odds are, that's how you were picturing me. That's not a coincidence.  Labour was the first to adopt All-Women Shortlists (AWS) and -- prominent female leaders in other parties notwithstanding -- of the major parties only Labour have come close to having a 50% female parliamentary party. If we stop using them, we won't magically carry on having that kind of representation. The failure of the other parties to elect women is evidence of this.  Everyone has innate prejudices which make it very, very difficult to judge other people 'on merit' or treat them equally. This has been shown over and over again, in dozens of areas: Stop-and-search statistics, arrest and conviction rates, the weight judges and juries give to witness statements; how job interviews and CVs are judged; exam results; literary awards; how likely people are to interrupt or ignore you in casual conversation... The list goes on and on.  The people in this thread claiming that these things should be done 'on merit', without any rules about how people are selected, are demonstrably wrong in their claims that they, or anyone, is capable of making such a judgment.  You may not (indeed, should not) like the fact that you are more likely to listen to someone who looks like David Cameron or even Ed Miliband than you are to someone who looks like Diane Abbot, but it almost certainly is a fact even if you're a black woman.  Now, as to OP's question: Yes, I agree with All-Women Shortlists. I do not believe that you could walk into a meeting of the PLP and correctly guess which women were selected on All-Women Shortlists and which on open lists. They are all there on merit.  There are various other rules in the Party to ensure that minorities are represented (for example, when nominating an MP there are rules to make sure people from ethnic minorities are represented). I would happily see those rules expanded. We live in a country where: the government is attacking people with disabilities; where we imprison proportionally more black people than does the notoriously racist US; where we have deep religious and ethnic divides resulting from conflicts around the world, many of which are partly our responsibility; where a major newspaper refuses to use the correct pronuons when discussing transgendered people. We need to make sure the most vulnerable are protected and we do that, in part, by allowing them to represent themselves at every possible level of our Party, and of our society."

The Corbyn argument is 'Let's offer the public something they don't want and that they have told us they don't want, consistently, for decades, in the hope that we'll convince them this time'. This is a bad argument.  It's also a bad idea to offer re-heated Blair-arguments or re-heated Miliband arguments. We need to try new arguments and if they don't work in five years time, we need to try other new arguments.  I am thus far unconvinced by any of the leadership candidates because of the lack of new arguments.

We tried taking baby steps to the left and it hasn't worked. Moving to the right is tantamount to idiocy, you wanna have a sensible centre, centre-right party then join the Tories but seriously, Labour should do better.  Corbyn is the anti austerity candidate, or the nearest we'll get. That argument is not only not fossilised, its popular too. You convince people that spending money on them is the right thing to do and they'll follow you to the end of the Earth, just compare the results in Balls' and Corbyn's constituencies if you don't believe me."

I am, by most definitions, on the left-wing of the party. That's why I want to see new policies that will redistribute wealth and power to the people. What I don't want to see is institutional conservatism: A blind faith that things set up half a century or more ago (the NHS, the BBC, universal education) are perfect and wonderful and should never be changed.  Austerity remains popular. The Tories would not have increased their vote share if it didn't. Stop fighting yesterday's battles."
LabourUK,3a4u3k,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Fri Jun 19 10:19:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the Tories won because austerity was popular. They won because Labour were complacent and failed to adequately advertise an alternative message.  To add to this, you're a lefty and you're supporting the Labour party, and that would imply you'd reject austerity on the basis that it's just bad for people to make them pay more for less.

I am, therefore, in favour of making compromises in order to win. If -- I don't believe this, by the way -- if the only way to win were to accept austerity, I would support that, because Labour would do whatever it could to mitigate the impact of austerity on the poorest."

There's no need to be so sensitive, we're on the same side here.  I still don't think the reason right wing parties won out was policy, I think there's more in that the alternatives were too weak. And if you're including UKIP in that then they appeal to a different sort of voter and gain plenty of protest votes too."

LabourUK,3a4u3k,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh... that's not how argument works.  The Tories won not because they conform to the public agenda but because they set the public agenda. They convinced people that austerity is good for the economy. They convinced people that privatisation is good.   Obviously you can't win an election saying ""I disagree with everything the public thinks"", you have to do things more subtly. Whilst public opinion isn't fluid, it isn't solid either. Just look at Nigel Farage in the European and Local Elections (I know it's hard) or the SNP in the General Election, they didn't get the level of influence they did by conforming to the public agenda set by the Tories. They got where they are by driving the agenda. People wouldn't have even had an opinion on an EU referendum if Farage hadn't driven the point in. And the Scottish weren't even thinking of the possibility of going at it alone until the SNP rose.  That's where Ed went wrong, the people just heard what he was saying and were like ""If you are saying the Tories took things in an okay direction, why on earth would we want to change course?""."
LabourUK,3a4u3k,gamas,2,Wed Jun 17 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"The Tories set up a narrative that the public were happy to accept. The Corbyn argument is 'The public were wrong and if we offer them something else, they'll will accept that they were wrong'. Well, they won't. Literally no-one who voted Tory in 2015 is going to be won over by an anti-austerity message: The Tory austerity message is now more successful than it was five years ago.  Yes, we should set the agenda. But we can't just go 'Hey, there's an agenda we like. Now let's set it!' We have to come up with something people will want to hear. They don't want to hear anti-austerity."

Give them five years under the Tories, and only the Tories, with no Lib Dems and a slowly fading underlying argument (the economy is out of the woods, Labour haven't touched the economy for years, etc.).  Give them five years of slashed welfare, disappearing public services, privatisation upon privatisation upon privatisation, loan book selling, and the rich becoming richer and richer and richer.  And give them a strong Labour Party on the side of the many, not the few, with actual arguments to make and a clear alternative.  Then we'll all see why austerity is a bad plan for Britain."

Like the eighteen years people spent voting for Thatcher/Major doing just that?  You are making an argument that will convince no-one who is not already convinced of it. The Coalition gave people five years of all of the above and increased their share of the vote in an election where the majority of the electorate backed right-wing parties."
LabourUK,3a4u3k,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Jun 17 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm really disagreeing with your point, but it's worth remembering that in the last election the second biggest electoral group was ""didn't vote"", at something like 35%. While chasing non-voters is an inherently risky strategy (as they aren't inclined to actually reward you with votes), it is a reminder that the only votes up for grabs aren't Tory voters. Anyone that could cause 5 or 10% of those to turn out in their favour would have a very good day indeed."

Consider that as long as Cameron can appease all sides in his own party, he can pass literally whatever he wants, whether labour have 200 or 250 or 270 seats, it doesn't matter. I know it can make a difference in some cases but not under normal circumstances. Corbyn has a chance of reversing the trend of the last few elections the way Kendall, Cooper and Burnham simply couldn't.  Furthermore a point about Scotland, where labour could win back a lot of seats. The referendum showed us the majority of Scots don't want to leave, what they want are sensible policies that will act in their interest and frankly New Labour has not delivered for them. They're a country of free university education that don't want nuclear weapons. Corbyn is the candidate to tell people labour has changed. Kendall wouldn't win a single vote up there, and the other two just need to leave politics with dignity. Their formula doesn't work anymore, arguably it never did."
LabourUK,3a4u3k,Soodings,6,Fri Jun 19 10:18:15 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, that's probably against the Conservative Party rules (it forbids members from ""associating"" with any other political parties; registering as a supporter and making a donation would probably count).   I'm pretty relaxed about it. Can't imagine many people will be bothered, and those that do help provide the party with funds, so more fool them."

LabourUK,3a57x4,toomanyairmiles,5,Wed Jun 17 09:18:28 2015 UTC,"Fascinating read. The demographic point was interesting- Labour did not lose the support of ""aspirational middle class"" voters as some voices have been fond of saying, but did lose support amongst lower income, traditional Labour supporters.   Also something that I think we all knew- that our message was far better received by young people (who are numerous but less likely to vote) than it was by older people (the ""grey vote"", who turn out en masse like clockwork). And I'm not convinced pandering to the grey vote is the way to fix this; we desperately need to break through the apathy of our younger supporters and get them to turn out for us with the same gusto as the SNP's young voters do."

But I can lazily assume.)"
LabourUK,3a5vvy,Patch86UK,2,Wed Jun 17 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"Well, exactly.  It's not that Hodges doesn't have any kind of a point here: We all need to be aware of our in-built prejudices and as a party of social justice, we need to be especially aware of it. And this is exactly why we have all-women shortlists and other rules to make sure minorities are represented. We should be changing the rules of our leadership elections to reflect that and I think it's likely that we will (someone proposed a rule-change to make sure that if the leader's a man the deputy must be female and I suspect that will be approved).  Like I say, Hodges does have a point, but as all too often, he's writing for his 'Theoretically left-wing but anti-Labour' paycheque. Particularly when talking about the mayoral elections, it's hard to know what to make of his arguments, exactly: We already have rules to make sure the ticket is diverse (and so it is). But that doesn't mean we absolutely have to then elect one of the BAME or female candidates and he totally skims over the fact that, should Tessa win, she'll be the first female candidate for London Mayor from any major party and likely the first female Mayor of London. He also says nothing about the other major party's selection processes or how likely they are to field female and/or minority candidates: I suspect the answer is 'not very', except in the case of the Greens, who will almost certainly field a woman.  In conclusion: Does Labour have a perfect track record on inclusion: No! Of course it doesn't! Does it have a better track record than any other party? Yes, of course it fucking does."

I think he's addressed the concerns over his LGBT record pretty satisfactorily. And he also called out Hunt for providing no opposition to the lifetime ban on gay men donating blood in Northern Ireland.  The steps towards increasing private influence in the NHS began under his predecessor Health Secretaries, especially Milburn. As I understand it, Burnham removed the 'any willing provider' clause in order to give preference to the NHS as provider rather than outsourcing. He's also done really great work on mental health issues, especially around the need to treat mental health issues as important as physical ones.  And finally, he came to speak to my old uni's Labour group in 2012 (if memory serves). He came across very positively, he was clearly very passionate about the NHS and his emphasis of mental health was really important to me. He had to pop out of his talk at one point as he was on the phone to the BBC, trying to get them to provide coverage of a leaked document which demonstrated Tory NHS privatisation plans. Perhaps it's simplistic to base my view of a politician on a meeting such as this, but he came across as a really genuine, committed, and thoroughly decent bloke."

The thing he has experience with is the thing we're most popular for (I've literally had people on the doorstep say 'I'm voting Labour because I found out the other day that they founded the NHS'!). That's a positive association right there.  He's also emphatically not a 'Londoner who only knows/cares about London' and you can tell that just by his accent, if not from what he actually says. Maybe you can tell it from what he says, too. I'm a Londoner, so I'm not a great judge.  He worked hard and successfully over the Hillsborough thing.  He also increased his majority in his own seat at the last GE, and I suspect his success and popularity locally contributed to us winning back the other Liverpool constituency (whichever one we won, I can't remember right now).  Despite running against Ed then voting for David, he was able to be a loyal and useful ally during Ed's leadership, which says something for his ability and willingness to work toward party unity.

Actually sorting it out will take either a) forever or b) a government that's willing to spend all it's political capital on revolutionising the system.  In other words, while this sounds vaguely encouraging (emphasis on 'vague'), I am not holding my breath for any kind of decent educational reforms."
LabourUK,39u3za,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon Jun 15 09:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced it would require that much political capital. The Tories have managed to fundamentally change the education system almost by accident, and nobody but the teaching unions have worried about it all that much. If Labour announced another shakeup that the unions were on board with, I can't imagine anyone else will die in a ditch over it.   The important question to me isn't how they'd implement their changes, but what they think those changes would be. While I'd personally welcome the return to localism in education that would come by putting Academies back under Local Authorities' authority in some way, that's hardly earth shattering. Ditto phasing out Free Schools- welcome, but meh."

We need an alternative, a proper one, one that says austerity doesn't work for the people and we need to try something else. We need something strong enough so that come 2020 I can tell my friends to vote Labour for a better reason than they're the least objectionable option."

However, if he became leader, I could see the Tories and Murdoch's loving relationship producing such a number of stories portraying him as an unstable lefty nutjob who you'd be mad to vote for that it's basically seen as the truth, a la the ""Labour overspent"" myth. I just don't think the public would take to him, much as my heart wants to say otherwise. In other words, the Tories' fear factor tactic would work just as well as with Miliband. That being said, I still think winning 2020 with any of the candidates is a serious longshot relying on some horrible mistakes in this term from the Tories and categorically crushing the myth of our fiscal irresponsibility."
LabourUK,39sbw1,smcnally96,3,Sun Jun 14 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"The fact we allowed that to get by is an utter utter travesty. I think if the party earnestly had the wishes of the majority at heart, the Tory narrative that Labour are worse on the economy and worse for working people and also ""loony lefties"" would collapse. The truth is the the Tories would've been worse, that they're subtly and systematically screwing over the majority for the sake of the opulent few, and that in spite of everything one point requires stressing above all others. Being left wing isn't a bad thing. Being left wing means you care about other people, and we shouldn't be ashamed to build ourselves back up as a credible left wing force with our own story of the events of the last decade, and a less naive approach to economic problems.

Remember how the coalition could never last, the Tories would never get an overall majority because incumbent parties never increase their vote share.  Quite frankly this is a new era of politics, any of the candidates could win a GE.  The political landscape could be very different in five years time.  All we need is someone with a clear and optimistic vision which is actually different from the Tories.  The Scottish votes will start coming back, the UKIP votes will come back and people will be tired of the Tory in fighting.  Things can only get more favourable for Labour and worse for the Tories.  Jeremy would get my vote.  He speaks with passion and clarity, has nothing to do with the last government and will vigorously stick it to the Tories every chance he'd get."

The main thing will be finding a wy to neutralise Tory attacks on the Mid Staffs thing. If we do that successfully, I think he can win (obviously that's not the only thing we need to do to win). If we can't do that, he'll lose, however good the rest of his campaign is.  As for the others, I agree with most other people in this thread. Kendall doesn't sound distinctive enough: She's taken Concede And Move On but only got as far as 'concede', so she just sounds like a Tory. Cooper is too close to both Eds (she's married to one and was Shadow Home Sec to the other). Corbyn is not a serious candidate: Even he doesn't want to win, just to broaden the debate. Good for him!

LabourUK,39gbte,DELB_,9,Thu Jun 11 15:15:14 2015 UTC,A little off topic but I completely agree with John when it comes to us accepting the Tory narrative of the economy. The fact that Liz Kendall has accepted the idea of a mandatory surplus is pretty depressing for those of us who wanted to support her.
LabourUK,39gbte,sgtscrapper,8,Thu Jun 11 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"I'm being devil's advocate here, but regarding surpluses, you could argue she's trying to be true to Attlee's Labour rather than the Conservatives.  In the last 100 years (so starting well before WW2), the only times we've ever run a budget surplus were    Under Attlee who ran a budget surplus in the years 48/49 and 49/50  Thatcher who ran a surplus in one solitary year 87/88 and  Blair in 98/99, 99/00, 00/01    As you can see, most surpluses have happened under Labour govts, so Labour should ""own"" the surplus thing. Yet somehow the Conservatives are able to pretend that they are prudent and Lab spendthrift, partly because Labour people attack anyone on their own side who say they should spend tax money wisely.  Actually it should be a given that tax money should be spent wisely - and Lab can cut waste without hurting front line services. For example, why are we sending a cheque for £250k to the Sultan of Brunei to help him maintain his Scottish grouse estate? Why are we paying wind farm subsidies to old titled Norman baronial landowners (like Cameron's father-in-law) when clean coal electricity is both cheap, efficient and environmentally friendly? Why arn't we at the forefront of getting the EU's corporate tax laws amended to make Google, Microsoft, Starbucks and co pay what they owe in respect to profits earned in the UK?  We can't attack on any of these because we've knee-jerked decided that if Conservatives are against spending, we're for it, even if it means precious tax money wasted on subsidies to our traditional enemies.  The smarter response would be to say we agree with the principle that tax money must be wisely spent, we disagree on where the cuts should fall and on how to safeguard tax money from the EU corporate vultures (we've abrogated responsibility for challenging EU mistakes entirely)"
LabourUK,39gbte,aenor,3,Thu Jun 11 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that economic credibility should not be a 'Tory thing' and that Labour should not allow the narrative that the Tories are the only party that can spent responsibly.   However, I don't see how we can support mandatory surpluses in particular without all but agreeing with the Tory arguments around 'Labour's mess' ect, seeing as we did not achieve a surplus in the final Brown years.  I think my biggest concern is exactly how the Labour party goes about winning back economic credibility, quite possibly you are correct in this, and for now I'll give Liz the benefit of the doubt and say that she is trying to achieve this."
LabourUK,39gbte,sgtscrapper,3,Thu Jun 11 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"We didn't acihieve a surplus in Brown's final years because there was a once-in-60-years financial depression! George Dubya Bush (Republican) didn't have a surplus at that moment either and neither did Sarkozy (Gaullist).  We've boxed ourselves into a corner with the knee-jerk ""if they're against it we're for it even before we've heard the detail"".  We need to be smarter than this - and that requires thinking about the issues before spouting off. It would be great if we had our own list of things that should be cut (like wind-subsidies to cameron's father-in law) and we could circulate it and put pressure on the Conservatives to respond.  But at the moment we're not putting any pressure on them at all. Just knee-jerk saying ""All spending is good even if it's on total rubbish"". The public quite rightly isn't impressed.   We need to change strategy.  P.S. I'm not sure that HS2 is a good deal for the taxpayer. In the following video on economic hubs (which I highly recommend), Evan Davis makes a case that east-west railways that connect Liverpool and Manchester with the great Yorkshire cities will yield a greater economic benefit. Yet I haven't heard a peep from anyone in Labour championing this idea:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpUNIKB-WaU"
LabourUK,39gbte,aenor,3,Thu Jun 11 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. The biggest reason why people didn't want to vote Labour was on the economy. If Labour could tackle that and find a way to become a fiscally responsible party (along with the care, fairness and compassionate policies), that would be brilliant and a vote-winner. After all, you need a good economy to fund the NHS, stop the ""austerity measures"", and so on. It's madness to simply ignore the public's concern about spending and the economy.   Plus Labour's biggest mistake wasn't over-spending. It was not regulating the banks. I wish the contenders would talk about this more and talk about fixing that so it doesn't happen again."
LabourUK,39gbte,InBluePain,3,Fri Jun 12 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"Liz has probably lost my vote as a result of her accepting Osborne's mandatory surplus nonsense. It's not only posturing, but supremely damaging long-term to the nation to pander to the current obsession with running a surplus. It's the same nonsense that the Republicans in the US shriek about from time to time. It means not investing in long-term economic growth or infrastructure, it means the government sitting on its hands in recessions instead of getting the economy back into growth.  Running a surplus does not inherently equal good economic policy. It completely ignores the fact that your overall % of debt can decline even when you're running a deficit so long as the economy is growing sufficiently. I'm not on the left of the party, but the redefinition of economic credibility to mean budget surpluses at all costs is downright dangerous, and will be immensely damaging to the people already at the bottom of the pile."

LabourUK,39d7za,CaptainHayashi,3,Thu Jun 11 09:45:20 2015 UTC,To both you and /u/Kingy_who/ i'd point out that those nominations add up to only 162 of the 232 parliamentary party so there are still 70 MP's left to declare an allegiance.   If past is prologue those members will declare for Corbyn and Creagh in order to ensure a debate.
LabourUK,39d7za,CaptainHayashi,2,Thu Jun 11 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"Time is ticking on, though.  And at least some of those members are going to withhold nominations entirely—they don't want to put themselves on the wrong footing with the leader if they nominated someone else, for instance.  Certainly that was Tom Watson's reasoning, as he wants to be an effective deputy to any leader.  You're right, though, in that there is hope."

LabourUK,39d7za,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Party unity is also important -- one of the things that made Ed's tenure as leader problematic was that he didn't actually win the support of his MPs, which was one of the things lots of people used against him, and contributed to the 'weak leader' narrative. By nominating someone that you think is likely to win, you're neutralising the argument that they don't have the support of their MPs. Showing support for your leader doesn't have to be about your career, although obviously that may also be in the back of their minds, but at this stage, nominating Burnham isn't going to boost you up in his eyes very much when he's sorting out the Shadow Cabinet (assuming he wins) because if he does give seats to his allies, he'll give it to his earliest allies, not the guys who nominated him at the last minute."

Due to my area being rural we still have a big powerful lobby group within that sector.  Made a point about reaching out to the farmers who are unhappy with the Tories and was told they had a self interest in keeping some things the same.  This is the same group who voted in favour of blocking strikes from farm workers but decided to strike and block some main roads around diary distribution centres in the local area when things did not go their way. Tory party have strong support from them even if they have lost so much.  Tories removed a series of safe guards in the name of the free market which impacted the farmers.  I was aware of a small group of self interested farmers who gain loads of subsidies from the EU. Around £1 million goes between something like 10 farmers every year.  Say farmers been told small number are just land owners.     One of the points made was we should expand to other groups but should not place all hopes on the farmers.  Something which I agree with but still worth reaching out to this group after all most UKIP voters are apathetic who turned out to vote.  SNP showed the power of apathetic voters even in safe seats.    When it came to the meeting one or two most was disappointed with the current state of the party.  Mainly the format money not coming to local CLP. Hints about voting reform.  Also was told that was somebody else around my age and put in touch with him signed up on a mailing list.  Was also given the name of somebody who is quite a socialist.  Owen Jone's Books are on my reading list next after brief of history of time along with another book.    Should made a note of it but was given me at the end and was talking to three people at the same time.  Going to see if I can find the books he was talking about.   Going to be looking at demographic numbers along with income numbers think it would be wise to look at something like that."

York is split into two constituencies--York Outer, which is safeish Tory, and York Central, which is safeish Labour.  You can tell whenever you go into York through Outer, it's the farmers that hold the Tory vote up.  Field after field after field with massive Conservative banners, bigger than anything you'd ever see on someone's window or in someone's garden.  It's kinda the same wherever you go in North Yorkshire, but knowing that just a few miles into the city--the same city--it changes into the single Labour seat in the county is surreal."

LD was on the council same with a couple Labour guys. Surreal how failure can be rewarded.   One thing to say is UKIP did hurt Labour here along with the Tories.  We could had one or two more Labour guys on the council.  Was told that a couple UKIPers was ex Tories with still strong links to the party.   Just requires more members and effort.

I've discovered that the Labour people around here are pretty left wing - there was a large group of people wearing 'Free Palestine' shirts who were pretty outspoken about various issues. It was definitely worth attending and I hope to go to others.  There was supposed to be a branch meeting last night but it got called off because the secretary didn't send the invitations out in time.

He went on TV in 2001, just announced he was increasing funding for the NHS and bounced the Treasury into funding it. He built 149 new hospitals and staffed them, increasing capacity massively. Without that, we'd be in complete trouble. As it is, Blair's increase in NHS capacity will hit the wall of population growth by about 2020, so Labour has to get it's act together by then.

The nationalisation was an epic mistake - it created such colossal blowback that people joined the Conservatives in massive numbers creating a mass movement that meant they were in power for most of the post war period.  I agree with giving independence to India, but it was a massive mistake to cave to the Islamists and partition India into India and Parkistan. Traditionally there was no Pakistan, it was a fake/false creation that needed ethnic cleansing to make it work and it's been a sore on the world (Afghan taxi drivers tell me that all their woes, including the set up of the Taliban have been down to the interference of Pakistan secret services). If India had been given independence as a single whole secular state encompassing what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh, world history would be different. Of course it wasn't entirely Attlee's fault, that idiot Mountbatten should shoulder much of the blame as he was governor and on the spot at the time.  So I guess Attlee's legacy was as mixed as Blair's. But in the end they were merely men, and the fault is ours in expecting them to be gods"

Everything is portrayed as the fight between the left and right of the party, partly because they're the loudest groupings, and partly because both (yes, I'm laying blame on myself here!) want to paint the debate as a false dichotomy.  For the Blairites, it suits them to shape the debate as ‘either you go with us, and we're successful, or you go back to the 40s with insane Marxist rhetoric that hates aspiration and progress’.  And for us lefties, we're often guilty of ‘either you move forwards with a full anti-austerity agenda, or you go back to the dark days of Blair and Iraq and NHS privatisation’.  Obviously in an ideal world I'd love to live under a Bennite/Skinnerite government with full nationalisation, progressive taxation, and everything under the sun free at the point of use.  But, even if that's the goal to work towards (and that's certainly a position not held by most people), we need to compromise, find the economic and practical limits, and/or at least gradually slide the window along to the left from its current position in the land of Thatcherite neoliberalism, and that's where the centre of the party come in.  (Incidentally, I've been wowed by how very normal Jeremy Corbyn comes across.  When you think hard left, you think of Dennis Skinner and his thick working class accent, bellowing in the aisles.  While Dennis is my hero, and he has a massive role as the moral heart of the party, our leader needs to come across as at least slightly moderated and approachable to all in society.)"

You underestimate his influence on the party, even today. Straight after the election, on the QT after the defeat he was whipping out the Blairite narrative that all the top brass have been following ever since.

I bet you disagree with your boss on umpteen occasions, but only whinge to your spouse about it, in the office you do what you are told, because that's the contract.But does that make you culpable for your bosses mistakes?  Mandelson is a whole different issue - he was an elected MP and member of the Cabinet, so a decision maker. He's also a tribalist though - I'll always admire him for going back to help Gordon Brown and limiting the Labour losses in the 2010 election.

Mandelson is a tribalist for New Labour and New Labour alone, he repeatedly attacked Miliband before and after the election for distancing himself from New Labour, Brown still represented New Labour don't forget.

By all means pretend that he's a ""Tory"" and that the Conservatives (""the NHS is a 60 year mistake"") would have done the same.  And that everyone would have been better off if Blair hadn't turned up and Labour had continued to lose elections. And that it's important to ignore Blair and Campbell and be ""pure"" so Labour continues to lose. That'll teach 'em something or other!  (And lets not pretend John Smith would have won had he lived - he was losing party members fast, they'd lost four general elections, were no longer up for the fight and had given up and were walking out, they had no confidence in him.

Smith had the unions backing and lets not forget Black Wednesday and the sleaze of the Tory party at the time which Blair promised to get rid of.  I hate Blair because he went back on the few Labour values he promised. He didn't renationalise the railways, that policy now belongs to only the far left, he didn't end NHS internal markets to stop hospitals competing with each other, he accelerated them.   He ran with the line 'Education, Education, Education' and brought in tuition fees. He began the privitisation which has given the Tories the all clear to privatise everything that isn't nailed down.   Blair may have won three elections, but he did more harm than good. Especially to the Labour party, he loved mingling with corporate types, replaced sleaze with war crimes and then brought sleaze back.  This notion that New Labour is the only way to win is what keeps Labour stuck in the past. I'm not calling for a return to 1970s socialism. I'm just asking for a modern democratic socialist party, not the Tory-lite party that Labour is morphing back into.

The Blair era was the best time of their lives - they got what they had been after for decades - capitalism with a safety net. They got the NHS sorted, they got education improved, they got to make some money.  You talk about tuition fees - so I'll direct your gaze to Scotland. The SNP have abolished tuition fees and in England it's £9000 per annum - and yet there are more poor people in England going to university than in Scotland!!! How can that be? Easy - the SNP raided the schools budget to pay for the tuition fees. So those poor Scots? They don't even get the grades to qualify for university, because Scottish schools have been trashed. It's not money that prevents people from going to university, it's grades, it's always been grades and Blair introduced fees to be able to divert money into the schools budget to improve people's grades so they had a shot and weren't ruled out before they even reached 18.  The SNP have done the opposite - they've tried to recreate the 1960's when the vast majority got crappy secondary modern education doing woodwork when machines had already made that stuff obsolete, while the money went to their ""betters"" to pay their university fees. But at least in the '60s there were plenty of jobs for the unskilled. Today they only thing someone unskilled can do is cleaning toilets, everything else is done by robots.

And despite Black Wednesday and all the rest, he was losing party members.  There are just two ways to win: have a lot of members that do a lot of canvassing (Blair, Obama, SNP) or have a lot of money and buy people to do your electioneering for you (Cameron). Smith had neither - and he would have lost. He wasn't convincing his own party who were walking out, no chance of convincing the voters.  Without Blair, the LibDems would have replaced Labour as they softy lefty opponents of the Conservatives. Which means that Blair, hate him as much as you like, is the only reason the Labour party still exists to fight the fight!"
LabourUK,38wk85,aenor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"Also, you keep talking about renationalising the railways as though this is the epitome of left-wing thinking.  But most people travel on the railways once a year at most, and if you book at least a month in advance it's cheap. The regular users of the railways are middle-management earning at least £50k and who can afford the £2000k monthly rail tickets. Of course they moan, but they can afford it.  It would be an utter travesty to take money from other needier parts of the budget (or put up taxes on poor people) in order to nationlise the railways and provide socialism for middle-managers!  Wakey Wakey! The era when the poor travelled to work by rail has long gone because a) work has changed and b) most people prefer to travel by car and c) the poor travel by bus and not inter-city either, they travel by bus within their cities.  You could end up wasting a lot of money due to trying to help imaginary people from the past, and the result will be hurting real people in the present and helping the well-off!  If you actually said, lets provide bus-passes for the unemployed to help them get to interviews, I'd say great! But no, all you want to do is renationalise the railways to help the middle-managers because it fits in with an idea of Labour formed SEVENTY YEARS AGO. Like time hasn't changed or anything."

LabourUK,38wk85,aenor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"You haven't refuted any of my points.

P.S. 13 years in power wasn't ""short term success"". It was the only taste of power Labour had in 40 years. If ""integrity"" means permanent opposition, what is the point.

LabourUK,38w0be,Patch86UK,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:19:29 2015 UTC,"On Education:   Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Burnham were both furthest to the left when it came to defending the comprehensive system. Mary Creagh and Liz Kendall chose instead to focus on the effects of education – with Kendall describing it as the key to tackling inequality and Creagh quoting Einstein while attacking Michael Gove.  The related issue of tuition fees also divided the candidates, with Corbyn offering to abolish them and both Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper proposing to move to a system of a graduate tax. Liz Kendall said that she would not abolish fees, putting her spending emphasis instead on the early years.   On the Party's structure in Scotland:   Andy Burnham was challenged over the perception that he supported an independent Scottish Labour Party. He responded that he hadn’t wanted to dismiss the idea – put to him by some Scottish Labour members – out of hand, but it instinctively didn’t feel right to him. Yvette Cooper argued that we must not break up the Labour Party and must cherish the values of our solidarity. People struggling to achieve their dreams in Scotland have more in common with those doing the same in England than divides them. Liz Kendall also expressed opposition to the idea. She argued that Labour had campaigned in and won the Scottish referendum by arguing that we are stronger when we pool our resources and share our risks and that should be as true for the Labour Party as it is for the country. Mary Creagh – on the other hand – did not rule out supporting a independent Scottish Labour Party explicitly, but did say that we need to tell the story of how over movement works across the union to provide better for everyone. Jeremy Corbyn probably went the furthest in supporting the idea of a separate and independent Scottish labour Party arguing that devolution has meant we are moving towards a more federal Britain and that could well mean we need a federal Labour Party."

LabourUK,38ndrf,rappersdo,4,Fri Jun 5 11:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whilst I rarely find myself agreeing Ken Clarke on anything (aside from his view on Cameron's British Bill of right), a statement he made yesterday I couldn't agree with more:   ""It causes me at times a slight annoyance to find that in the leadership election that’s broken out in the Labour party, some of those people who were a month ago his greatest admirers, his most loyal colleagues, closest to his cause, are now busily detaching themselves and attempting to scapegoat him for the problems that the Labour movement experienced.  My opinion, for what it’s worth, is Mr Miliband fought a very good election campaign and actually it was much better than anybody expected because of the tabloid press and the expectations they had raised. I thought he put the message across very well, I thought the message was wrong and that was the judgment of the majority of constituents in my constituency and in my part of the world. It is not the case that somehow his performance has anything to do with the result.""   It was right for Ed to resign because otherwise that shadow would have hung over him (and quite frankly, the guy deserved a break after the amount of press bullying he got), but all these candidates are now tripping all over themselves to see who can throw Ed and his policies under a bus the fastest."

I have a great deal of respect for him and the way his conducts his parliamentary business. Ukip struck gold with his defection.
LabourUK,38i9vf,Custard88,3,Thu Jun 4 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Thing with Carswell is he doesn't seem to represent the rest of UKIP at all.   He's a self-professed Gladstonian Liberal which is a far cry from Farage's common sense rhetoric and he also seems to be a bit delusional on why some working class people may vote UKIP, they're not doing it for their libertarian policies.  He's also a fierce defender of the contribution of immigrants and is often left as some sort of maintenance man after Farage says something controversial."
LabourUK,38i9vf,rappersdo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:01:11 2015 UTC,"Spot on. If you read some of Carswell's Telegraph pieces from before he switched to UKIP, he's really disdainful of the Kippers, both above and below the line.  I think he switched because he was fed-up of the Conservatives and thought he could re-make UKIP in his own image. But no chance of the latter while Farage is head of the party (which is why Carswell was so keen to see him go).  UKIP is a funny old beast. It was started by a Liberal, Alan Sked, who got chased out of his own party by Farage. Farage has taken it into a BNP-lite populist direction. Libertarians like Carswell are trying to shift it away from the populists.  Once the referendum is over, all the opposing factions will have a massive row."

It just doesn't seem like him."
LabourUK,38foeh,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"It does seem like him.   This is the Ed Miliband who knew that Ed Ball's constituency was in trouble and didn't tell him, because he quite liked the idea of him losing and appointing someone else as Chancellor. A better, more honest man would have done a reshuffle and also helped save Ed Balls' seat. Because that's how you deal with someone you want to demote. You are upfront and straight and you don't sacrifice seats.  The bit about Miliband knowing Balls was in trouble comes from the following article:  http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9528312/inside-the-milibunker-the-last-days-of-ed-did-ed-miliband-sacrifice-ed-balls/   Another MP said: ‘The polling was the most sensitive part of the operation. That’s because it was the polling that showed Ed’s personal ratings. So they kept it very, very tight. Only about four or five people in Ed’s office had access to it and they didn’t like sharing it outside Ed’s team. In fact, it would be circulated in a way that meant those people would hold back bits of data from each other.’  This failure to compile or share accurate data proved catastrophic. In Yorkshire, hundreds of activists were deployed to Sheffield Hallam in an attempt to ‘decapitate’ Nick Clegg. But half an hour down the road was Morley and Outwood, the seat of Ed Balls. In the final days of the 2010 campaign, Balls telephoned an MP friend. ‘I’ve just had Alicia Kennedy [Labour’s deputy general secretary] on,’ said Balls. ‘She says I might be in trouble in my seat and I should get back there. What do you think?’  ‘Get back there now,’ his friend said. Balls did and clung on by 1,101 votes.  This time, no call arrived. There are some in the Balls camp who think that was no accident. ‘The leader’s office had the polling data, and they sat on it,’ a Balls ally told me. ‘They knew what was happening nationally two weeks out, they knew what that meant for Ed’s seat. And they sat on it.’ The implication is that Miliband thought he would run a minority government after an election that might depose his shadow chancellor. And that he considered this no bad thing.   Also regarding Sheffield Hallam, the LibDems spent a third of their budget defending Clegg as a result of the decapitation strategy - if there was no decapitation threat, they'd have spent it defending their seats in the South West which would have meant the Tories wouldn't have picked up as many and perhaps wouldn't have got an overall majority.  So Miliband is a mix of Machiavellian and not being able to think of the consequences of his own decisions. Fatal in a multi-party election like this one."

LabourUK,38d7ji,Shrimpeh007,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. The group most likely to vote is the upper-middle class AB group, which votes overwhelmingly Tory. 76% of the AB group turned out to vote in 2015, and 43% of them voted Tory.  Conversely, the social class grouping least likely to turn out to vote is the semi-skilled/unskilled-working class/unemployed DE social group, of whom 41% voted Labour but only only 57% turned out to vote. The lower down the social class spectrum you go, the more turnout falls. In terms of social class, the groups which tend to vote Labour are also less likely to turn out to vote, disadvantaging us. There are lots of reasons why these groups are less likely to vote - political disengagement, being busy with work or family, or simply not caring.

LabourUK,38c71t,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Jun 3 09:42:17 2015 UTC,"Labour should be very careful here.  If you look at the polls from 2014 (and I know they weren't quite accurate, but still the trend shows interesting info) - Labour were on 39% before Miliband ruled out a referendum - and then started falling as soon as he did. Those were the blue-collar folk who switched to UKIP.  That's why I think it is a mistake to have this leadership election before the referendum. You could be alienating a lot of voters you will need for the general election, if you pick the wrong side.   People are assuming the European Referendum is a slam-dunk just as they assumed the Scottish referendum was a slam-dunk. The Scottish situation shows that it was closer that people thought and Lab paid a heavy price because some voters wouldn't forgive their long-term stance.  Instead of saying ""I'll create a separate yes campaign"", the best strategy would be for a Labour leader to do a Harold Wilson and say ""I'll allow a free vote for MPs and members of the party"". Don't pin colours to either side.  P.S. Notice how Sturgeon is tying her party very closely to the EU, despite polls showing that Scots are more euro-sceptic than Londoners or the Welsh or people in the Midlands. She might get a shock in the referendum and there will be plenty of room for Labour rather than Conservatives to pick up those votes, provided Labour hasn't also tied it's colours to the same mast."

If we're talking about the reception of Foot in 1983… that was three decades ago, after the Falklands (which was a big coup for Thatcher's popularity).  He was so far left of Ed that it misses out a huge chunk of more-pragmatic socialism in between, and the manifesto wasn't exactly the most well-written-and-marketed thing in existence.  Perhaps we're working on opinion polls.  But they've been shown time and again to be inaccurate, and keep painting different pictures.  One of the other articles on this subreddit (I can't remember which) pointed out some opinion polling (heh) that actually suggested that a lot of our more progressive policies were quite well-received.  And if it's anything to do with how the media is portraying a right-wing message, then that's probably because they're funded by people with vested interests in a Conservative or UKIP government, by (excuse my inner Owen Jones) people who want the working class to turn on itself and ignore the man behind the curtain.  The media want us to believe that how you eat a bacon sandwich is reflective of your competence in government.  Why should we treat the media line with anything other than a well-voiced contempt?  I think it's more the advertisement than anything else: turns out that if you shape your message to be a loose bag of ‘screw the rich’ stabs, and miss the boat on convincing people you're credible on the economy, you lose elections.  Ed wasn't exactly left-wing to begin with, he just managed to get painted as dangerously lefty by the right-wing media, and their message wasn't strongly challenged.  Electable or not, there should have been a left-wing candidate in the election.  Not necessarily to get elected, but to keep the debate lively and two-sided, and not just the centre-right echo chamber that it's become.  We needed a Diane Abbott, or a Tony Benn, but not necessarily a Michael Foot. :P  EDIT: yeah, I know it looks like I've built up three straw-men here, but I'm not sure of what the reasoning for the perception of anything beyond Ed being unelectable is here, so I'm covering the bases I can think of."

And the most obvious fact: UKIP are fucking corroding our support across the north. They're like acid, slowly dissolving what lingering, irrational, ancestor-worshiping and tribalistic support we still have in working class communities in the north of England. They only got one seat but they did huge damage, and as long as the UKIP leadership can keep it together over the course of this parliament - and in particular if Carswell starts making a bigger presence in the media - we're in real danger of succeeding nowhere at all outside of London and a few other large cities."

I think there are more factors in play here than a clean left-right divide.  A lot of people who would position themselves in the left area of politics simply don't vote, for instance (and we should be looking at giving them reasons to feel re-enfranchised, not clubbing them over the head with more of the same).  And Labour were strung up in ways that aren't necessarily only going to wash with the right-wing (Labour crashed the economy, Labour will get in bed with the SNP, Labour are just Red Tories anyway, the list goes on…)  I don't doubt that we need to attract Tory voters to win (obviously).

So a sort-of pragmatic socialism, doing things like renationalising (or part-renationalising) the railways, being clear on halting the Govite school disaster and the sell-off of the NHS, and progressive taxation (but not sold as much in the style of Robin Hood perhaps), while not necessarily going all the way to class warfare and full-scale renationalisation (though I wouldn't mind the latter).  Holding the rich accountable (but not to ransom) while pushing the poor to take their place in the economy (everyone who can work should, and those who can't shouldn't be left to fend for themselves a la Cameron), and ensuring there's a place for all people in our narrative, without abandoning our roots as a movement for workers (whichever class!) is what we should do next.  I'm not a policy wonk, but I think there are quite a few 'lefty' policies that can be sold to the whole country, and the idea of tacking left and becoming unelectable or tacking right to win is a false dichotomy.  But that's the opinion of one member--having a full debate with all sides represented is what we should be doing.  And so far we aren't."

LabourUK,37yzuo,ProfessorZ00M,8,Sun May 31 16:29:24 2015 UTC,EU nationals permanently resident should be allowed to vote in general
LabourUK,37yzuo,Argel_Tal,2,Sun May 31 22:18:14 2015 UTC,And how would you know they're permanently resident?
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Sun May 31 22:23:39 2015 UTC,How do you know if a UK citizen has not been non-resident for 15 years?
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,6,Sun May 31 22:31:57 2015 UTC,"Former expat here. My parents still live abroad and have done for more than 15 years. They also still own a property in the UK. They looked into voting a while back and they basically could using the address of said property but it would involve them paying council tax there.   Honestly I have no problem with foreign nationals, especially EU ones, voting in our elections and referendums. Then again I have a radical post-nationalist view of the world."
LabourUK,37yzuo,aenor,2,Mon Jun 1 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"Good question. My wife's an EU national who's married (duh) to a British citizen, owns a home and has a child (with dual citizenship) here, so that could be seen as evidence that she's fairly permanent. Having a full-time job might also be pretty solid evidence.  Essentially, I'm not sure what the requirements would be, but I don't think it'd be particularly problematic to draw up a list."
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon Jun 1 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. Our head of government is a member of the Council of Europe, and so has an official say over EU matters. Given that, surely EU residents should be allowed to vote for the head of government if they live here?"
LabourUK,37yzuo,aenor,2,Mon Jun 1 11:33:37 2015 UTC,EU residents have a vote in their own country - so having a vote here would be double voting.  Consider the Council of Europe the equivalent of the US senate. You can't vote for senators in two states. That's why EU nationals can't vote for the head of govt in places they arn't citizens.  They can vote in european parliament elections though - and that's because that's more about representatives than anything else.
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, but not all EU residents are still resident in their own country. This includes my wife: She has no address in her home country where she could be registered to vote, so she has no say over the Council of Europe at all. Of course she can, as you say, vote in most other elections, including for the EU Parliament."
LabourUK,37yzuo,SoyBeanExplosion,2,Tue Jun 2 08:20:34 2015 UTC,"Can your wife not take up UK citizenship? If she no longer needs to reside in her home country (because she'd rather be with you!), then why not apply for citizenship?"
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"Well, she already has dual citizenship with an EU country and a non-EU country. She'd have to give up one to get British citizenship, too, and she feels weird about giving up her nationality, basically.  Anyway, I'm not in favour of EU citizens having a vote in General Elections purely because of my wife, I was just using her as an example!"
LabourUK,37yzuo,SoyBeanExplosion,2,Tue Jun 2 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not comfortable allowing anyone to vote in our country who can't see the importance of getting citizenship here. I'm not speaking about your wife, just people in general. There was a thread about this over on /r/unitedkingdom earlier, and there were a lot of EU residents who'd been here for years and years but explained that they hadn't got citizenship yet. Usually for very uninspiring reasons such as ""Too expensive"" (fuck off if you've lived here that long you could've saved up) or ""Don't see the point"" in getting citizenship in the country they consider their home. Frankly, anyone who ""doesn't see the point"" shouldn't be allowed to vote in the first place, so I guess it's good they self-selected."
LabourUK,37yzuo,Ajnin123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:26:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't see 'citizenship' as a legal status as particularly important. I think if there's good evidence that you're permanently settled here (full-time job, marriage, owning your home), you are a de facto citizen and should be treated as such: Indeed, for most purposes, you already are!"
LabourUK,37yzuo,Ajnin123,2,Wed Jun 3 10:33:48 2015 UTC,"It's not just about living here though, it's about expressing a level of commitment to this country and a desire to be part of our national/political community. It isn't supposed to be easy and quick, that would defeat the point. Citizenship is something to be desired and earned, not handed out like lollypops. If someone can't even muster up the effort to get citizenship of this country, why should we let them have any say over the future of it?"
LabourUK,37yzuo,AnxiousMo-Fo,4,Wed Jun 3 10:36:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why someone who so heavily supports UKIP, Enoch Powell and right-wing libertarianism, but also has consistently shown clear opposition to Labour and the Green Party, is so keen to regularly post in /r/LabourUK and /r/UKgreens.   Regardless, I see no problem in Dugdale's statements and I think it's fair that a decision which would dramatically impact the lives of EU Nationals should also include the views of those EU Nationals. She puts it very neatly as well:   “Put simply, I believe EU nationals who have chosen to live their life here, and make the UK their home, should have the right to vote in a referendum on the future of the country.  “EU nationals make important contributions to our communities, and to our economy. The influx of talent, creativity and a different perspective of work and culture enriches our society as a whole, resulting in a more diverse and innovative society.”"

LabourUK,37y8w1,Dangerman1337,3,Sun May 31 12:14:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, swallowing the Tory Manifesto will be poor in the long run and will just feed the ""Labour caused the crash"" line by Cameron. I disagree on some positions but I prefer her way over Liz Kendall (she seems to be a Blair wannabe without the policy slickness and wants America-style devolution) and Andy Burnham just seems intimidated by the media (C4 interview) and is (unfairly though) associated with Mid-staffs.

LabourUK,37yekr,Ajnin123,9,Sun May 31 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"This whole emphasis on the frankly Thatcherite line of everyone-should-get-on-their-bikes-and-help-themselves would be noble if it wasn't for the fact that it risks us forgetting that there are so many people in the country that simply can't, due to no fault of their own, go from the breadline to the headlines.  Labour must never think that the demolition of the welfare state it helped to create, and a return to thinly veiled social Darwinism, is the correct solution to the problems the welfare budget and employment system are facing.  I'm not saying Liz will do this, but given the things she has said, she worries me.  Also, shouldn't Labour be helping the working-class young regardless of race?  I'll argue til the cows come home that being white isn't the magical privilege theme park some people claim it is, etc. etc., but it seems weird to make racial classifications the basis of a leadership election."
LabourUK,37yekr,CaptainHayashi,3,Sun May 31 13:44:02 2015 UTC,Definitely agree. This accentuating of race on behalf of Liz Kendall is just as unpleasant as Dianne Abbot's 'putting black and ethnic families first' poster.

It's not about helping them at the expense of others, it's just a recognition that we've actually left behind the largest working class group in our country and that more needs to be done to help them.  Here:   Poor white British children now come out of our schools with worse qualifications than equally poor children in any other major ethnic group. They do less homework and are more likely to miss school than other groups. We don’t know how much of the under performance is due to poor attitudes to school, a lack of work ethic or weak parenting."

Personally, I think both Tom Watson and Stella Creasy are both excellent candidates for deputy leader from what I've seen far. They haven't focused on the 'white working class men' or alienating old/left Labour, they've both run positive and decent campaigns.

That she wrote an article called '2013: The Year in Sexism' outlining all the misogyny conducted by by white, western, males with a total lack of any mention of the real forms of sexism going on around the globe, like in - oh I don't know - Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan? But of course odd comments are far more cruel a form of sexism than rape, for which the victim can be convicted if you live in Dubai, or honour killings, which is perfectly legal in Pakistan.   And on her appearance on Question Time listed 'Islamaphobia' as one of the 'foremost' problems facing Britain, is worrying - primarily because she is willing to place that above the Tory threats to the Welfare State or the dire need for investment in the British economy.

Looking back, the mistake was to elect a Labour leader before the 2011 Scottish elections.   The Scots clearly  - well hate is too strong a word - but they didn't rate Miliband at all. They didn't want any part of a party he was leading (in contrast to their strong showing in 2010 for Gordon Brown).  No-one knew at the time Miliband was being elected that there would be a Scottish referendum in 2014. It was during the referendum I knew Labour had lost the general election. Miliband was looking less statesmanlike than Cameron and it was clear the Scots had completely dismissed him as a nonentity. He had to have his irons pulled out of the fire by Gordon Brown. And then just after Brown's barnstorming speech came Miliband's lacklustre one to the Labour conference. The contrast was awful.  With hindsight it would have been better for Labour to have elected a new leader in 2012. Blair too was elected mid-term and peaked just at the time of the general election."

We'll finance the monarchy through renting out the apartments Kensington Palace to various billionaires who want to live in ""status"" addresses. And so on.

LabourUK,37pn23,sosr,2,Fri May 29 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"No, I also nominated and spoke in his favour, but once Tessa had won the ballot for the female candidate there was too much support for Khan for the other spot. Our MP spoke in support of Khan as did some others.  I personally don't think that Sadiq's policies on rent control or the letting agency are achievable. He has also apparently changed his opinion on rent control, which isn't in itself a problem as long as it's sincere. I was disappointed during the election when he said he wouldn't reverse the legal aid cuts despite having protested against them so vigorously, and then wouldn't explain why not.   A few voted for Wolmar but there was a sense that many thought his profile was not high enough. Some new members and me included had not heard of him before. There were again a few for Diane Abbott but some people thought she wouldn't be able to command broad enough support and some accepted that opinion of her is polarised."
LabourUK,37ptw6,Ajnin123,3,Fri May 29 13:23:25 2015 UTC,"Regarding spending. There are some parts of the Labour offering that are very attractive.  Pretty much everyone across the spectrum thinks that paying for public services through tax is cheaper than paying for it themselves. So there's a real ""value for your money"" argument to be made on spending on health and education. i.e. we are not spending too much, we are saving you money by doing it this way. Cue lots of info comparing with the Unted States, France, everywhere else where it costs more than here.  The ""spending too much"" issue only comes up on transfer payments. People hate transfer payments, apart from the state pension, which everyone gets and which has been going for over a century, so everyone knows someone in their family that has received it.    That's why there is support for things like the bedroom tax amongst the public. They think, yeah, it's reasonable to ask a single person to move out of a three bed house to save money. Of course the issue of where they would go is another story. But they think the principle is sound. Which is why Lab made a strategic mistake banging on an on about it. It affected only a small portion of the population and the rest didn't see what the problem was. They should have shut up about it, waited till they got elected and then quietly repealed it. But banging on about things before you get to power, and setting yourself against public opinion is nuts.  A big part of the transfer payment budget is ""tax credits"". It should have been named ""tax rebates"" even though the recipients get more than they pay in. Language matters. People are fine with tax rebates but not so fine with ""credits"".  Also, people don't much like subsidies for things they don't use. I gawped when I heard that we were sending the Sultan of Brunei a cheque for £250,000 per year because he owns a grouse moor in Scotland. Should grouse moors attract subsidies like this? Why? Can the Sultan of Brunei not afford to look after his property without taxpayer help?  This kind of thing winds people up.  P.S. I think the grouse moor subsidy is a Tory innovation. So there should have been plenty of room for Labour to bang on about Tories wasting money. Only Lab somehow painted themselves into a corner where they were defending all govt spending, and anyone who said otherwise was evil, which meant they were defending subsidy payments to the Sultan of Brunei."

LabourUK,37p8kk,Ajnin123,1 point,Fri May 29 23:22:12 2015 UTC,She's the only Labour candidate which backs Labour's economic record:   At a Progress meeting on Saturday she refused to say that Labour overspent in government and gave a robust defence of its record in improving public services through investment. “People have forgotten the economic credibility of the last Labour government.”   http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/17/labour-leadership-election-candidates-compared

LabourUK,37lptb,aenor,5,Thu May 28 15:18:32 2015 UTC,A very important thing to consider - thanks for sharing!
LabourUK,37lptb,AlmightyWibble,3,Thu May 28 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"Good point.  So you are saying we need a leader who is seen as a 'safe pair of hands'?  Also, how do you create that fear factor about the incumbent Cameron?"
LabourUK,37lptb,matthewfelgate,2,Fri May 29 08:15:56 2015 UTC,"You need a leader who will be perceived as not threatening to any citizen. People will tolerate a PM they didn't vote for as long as he doesn't pose any threat to them.  And the threats always always involve property, not tax.   I mentioned in the article above that the nationalisation of businesses provoked a very very powerful backlash that ultimately propelled Thatcher in government. That was because confiscation of property was involved  - people didn't know where it would end. Would small businesses be targeted, would people's savings be confiscated, what about their houses?  To Blair's credit he understood that, hence the removal of Clause 4. And was able to raise NI to ""pay for the NHS"". So it's not tax that's the issue, but property rights.   In the last election, I have a vivid memory of someone talking about confiscating ""empty houses"". I vote Labour but a chill went down my spine. Thoughts started to race. What if my parents were ill and I had to shut up my house for a bit to go and look after them, would my house be confiscated by ""Red Ed"".  I don't even know if it was an official policy or just some idiotic think tank thinking they were being clever putting ideas out there.   Don't do that! It scares the heebie jeebies out of people and they can reject your entire package because of it. Even if it's not official policy and some foolish pressure group is proposing it. The English are very possessive about their things. Charles I was executed because he was threatening landowner interests (yes, yes, there was that divine right stuff, but that was an excuse to get rid of him).  The mansion tax also went down badly - mainly because people could imagine a situation where their property value rose so much they were caught up in it. It was no good saying ""the majority of the country wouldn't be affected"". People could imagine some period in the future where they would be affected. And that was enough to put them off.  Just don't say or do anything connected to property. Leave it alone and focus on the many more important things you could do and offer. It seems ridiculous that something so small could make people throw out an entire package, but that's what happens, over and over and over again.   Regarding tax, taxation of income of any sort is seen as ""fair"". So income tax, national insurance, corporation tax - these are all taxes on revenue generated and seen as fair game. Getting non-doms to pay their income tax was seen as an extremely good idea. Taxation on property is seen as unfair. You've bought it out of your after tax income. Is it your fault that the property price has increased (especially as you have no intention of selling and intend to stay put till the day you die)? How would you reduce your property value, go round shooting estate agents? Increasing the council tax bands would have been a better idea - the majority would have understood instantly that they would be unaffected. Amending an existing system is always easier than proposing a scary new one with god know what unintended consequences, and hence ample opportunity for opponents to make up consequences to attack you."

I think people are increasingly seeing the value of networks over hierarchies; of being able to, to some extent, pick and choose what they support about a party rather than committing themselves wholesale to it. I think there are ways to harness those things, like Podemos has in Spain, to great effect, and I have my doubts that Labour can do it."

LabourUK,37ko8q,CaptainHayashi,7,Thu May 28 11:37:30 2015 UTC,"This thinking is unhelpful.  Labour is the best opportunity for progressive politics this country has at the moment.  The fact that it's trending towards the right isn't an excuse to leave, it's a challenge to the left to speak up and fight.  Michael Foot said it best IMO.  The goal of the left in the Labour party is to ‘be in it to win it’, to teach the leaders, to be a strong voice within rather than without.  We might not ever make Labour the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat or what have you, and that's not entirely a bad thing, but we can steer Labour in subtle ways and keep up the fight for its cause.  The way the leadership election is going should be be an excuse to speak up, not walk out."

No reason for Labour's more left-leaning elements (a label I somewhat take issue with*) to repeat their mistake today.  *I don't consider myself a radical, in honestly. UK politics has taken a very worrying lurch to the right, and consequently has a skewed view of the political spectrum. Frankly if I were in the 1950s with the views I have now I'd just as easily be a Tory.

And the same applied to Labour in the 1980's - the SDP lot were content with the status quo (Thatcher) which is why they felt comfortable pursuing their own thing, it was win-win for them.  It's also interesting to look at the Conservatives because what happened to them is a mirror to what is happening in Labour.  When Blair was in power, they were comfortable - nothing bad was happening to the centre-right. So they felt they could pursue ""pure"" un-electable right wing politics (Hague, IDS) and there was no downside, because if they didn't win, and they were never going to with those policies, comfortable old Blair was in power and life was not so bad.  Then Gordon Brown comes to power, and they hate him. They are acutely uncomfortable with him being in power, and they suddenly got interested in having a moderate front man (Cameron) in order to get back into power - they even made compromises and went into coalition with the LibDems who were restraining them on all sorts of areas (Human Rights Act, spying on citizens etc). Being uncomfortable was what made them take getting into power seriously.  At the moment, the left is comfortable with Cameron, so they feel able to pursue their own ""pure"" policies whether Green or SNP, and if they don't win, no matter, comfortable lazy old Cameron is in power.  It will only be when Cameron leaves and the Conservatives elect someone uncomfortable as leader, that the left will wake up and make a real push for power (which always involves compromises).  However, I bet if you told purists who vote for Greens, SNP etc that the real reason they're doing it and refusing to compromise is because they're comfortable with Cameron, they'd protest loudly.

Their rise and fall are as much about the rest of the political landscape as anything else.  2005 was arguably the peak of the a Lib Dems, and it was a time at which Labour were hemorrhaging support to the yellows. Why? It was because the Lib Dems under Kennedy were portraying themselves as left-of-Labour, with Blair a Red Tory etc. 2015 is obviously the worst collapse back the other way the Lib Dems have ever experienced. Why? Because Labour were perceived as being back as the real non-Tory opposition, with the Lib Dems now nothing but Yellow Tories.  Both situations are as much about Blair/Miliband as about Kennedy/Clegg."
LabourUK,37i71a,raked456,5,Wed May 27 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"This was a really insightful post, in our area where we faced a big UKIP surge we went in on a local issue ""Hi I'm jylg from your local labour party, we are here to talk about X local issue"" that really opened up a lot of positive conversations and we would end with ""do you know which way you will be voting"".  Our data was so bad, knocking up labour promises to find non voters, kippers and even one who wanted to privatise the nhs was really depressing!"
LabourUK,37i71a,jylg,4,Thu May 28 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"This all very sensible, rational and reasonable. But, from one digital native to presumably another:  how the hell could you fund gathering, organising and printing all those leaflets? We're already at a massive disadvantage thanks to media bias, let alone the high net worth individuals picking the lowest tax band to lobby..."
LabourUK,37i71a,Ermahgerdrerdert,2,Thu May 28 01:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that in the short-term it would be very difficult to implement such a vast change across the Labour Party, across the country. However, it would be entirely possible within the next 5 years to implement such a system in key marginal seats where we have would have the concentrated financial and organisational ability to make it successful and then to use that as a foundation to develop the strategy throughout the country over the next decade."
LabourUK,37i71a,Tallis-man,4,Thu May 28 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't campaign, so I might be wrong, but it seemed to me that Miliband's 'conversations' strategy would inevitably lead to a surplus of 'wasted' conversations in strong Labour seats with active local Labour parties, and a relative deficit in the key marginals that the Conservatives targeted so aggressively (and effectively).  [I mean 'wasted' purely in terms of winning votes towards additional seats, rather than votes in an already-won seat.]  That's quite aside from the effectiveness of the approach itself.  But its implementation seemed systemically inefficient, given the realities of FPTP, and so strategically quite poor.  Would you agree, do you think that's the case?"
LabourUK,37i71a,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Thu May 28 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the idea that any conversation was wasted, unless of course the data gathered was inaccurate. Complacency in strong Labour areas are just as big a weakness, look at what happened in Scotland and with UKIP swings within Labour Strongholds.   I would agree there are inefficiencies in the system, but this is down to local organisations rather the Labour Party as a whole. The Labour Party simply does not have the resources to organise individual constituencies. Decisions, planning and organising of the majority of election campaigns have to be devolved to local members and they will of course have a vested interests in keeping members campaigning in their areas. It is difficult to see how the Labour Party can get past the inefficiencies this organisational system creates."
LabourUK,37i71a,aenor,3,Thu May 28 15:43:37 2015 UTC,Have you thought about pitching this to LabourList? It's an excellent contribution to the discussion and deserves a wider audience.
LabourUK,37i71a,JustAhobbyish,3,Thu May 28 10:48:01 2015 UTC,"I told a Conservative canvasser that I was voting for them, just to see what they would send me.  I don't know if this helps you effort, but here's what they did:  They started leafleting in October. I even got a personally addressed Christmas card from them, and was even leafleted on the Bank Holiday Monday in election week before 9 a.m. Their leaflets were nice and positive, lots of white space, lots of pictures of the candidate smiling and positive bullet points.  I guess they had a lot of money and spent a good deal of it before the short campaign (hence the leafleting starting in Oct) - presumably they hired people to leaflet, you can do that if you have cash. But during teh campaign they were pushing a lot harder than Labour was too.  Hope this helps"
LabourUK,37i71a,JustAhobbyish,1 point,Thu May 28 13:24:40 2015 UTC,Little curious what sort of data the party has access too and how it collects it. Demographic data could also be used to improve the ground campaign.  YouGov is a useful resource and ONS. Obama used various technology to make sure that list was updated and on hand for the party. Polling not always correct but other information can help make the picture clearer.   Curious about the whole process..
LabourUK,37i71a,JustAhobbyish,1 point,Thu May 28 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"The Party has private polling, but, it keeps the data hidden within the top of the party. There were rumours those at the very top knew for a number of weeks it looked like Ed Balls was going to lose his seat and hid it from him. Although, this is obviously just a rumour it indicates to extent at which the party keeps its data secret.  The issue the party has is how it uses the data & and its ability to collect data. The Party's ground campaign is not organised from a single room in Labour Party HQ, it is run by thousands of organisers in every seat and organisers outside of marginals never get a sniff of this data and there is no way to integrate demographics into contact creator.   The Labour Party has funding issues when compared with the Conservatives and we are dwarfed by funding in American politics. My argument is we need to utilise are greatest asset more effectively, and that is the quantity of the activists we have on the ground and to have the ability to use them more effectively, as opposition parties are already doing."
LabourUK,37hgoc,JustAhobbyish,6,Wed May 27 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"This is an example of caring about party more than country, and is the kind of thinking that turns people off who are not strongly committed to one party or another.  .  Presumably you want the min wage to increase?  And you are mad that it is happening because the Tories are doing it?  So you would prefer that working class people are not helped by this increase than have your team not be given credit?  Think about that for a second."
LabourUK,37hgoc,the_toe_,2,Wed May 27 18:23:23 2015 UTC,Happy the Tory party has changed their minds about this policy and seen that increase in wages is required.  Don't forget that this is a drop in the ocean compared to the decline most people have faced around 10% or more.    For the record I would rather see real wages return to the normal trend over a one off gesture after so long of wage decline.  More annoyed at Labour's lack of response to this and the media who has decided to focus on the EU ref over minor increase in wages after 13 years.  Major U turn on the anti business line. Tories have waited so long before acting great just great yet nobody going to say a word.   Anything this is why people get turned off you demonize a policy but do it.  Don't say Labour had a good policy lets borrow it or allow any real debate.    This is a drop in the ocean compared to what is required to repair the damage done to wages.  Bitter sweet victory in my eyes.   Worrying that Labour can't challenge this minor narrative policy is not credible and let the Tories get away with doing it.   Sure the working class people are going to love the fact the Gov could have acted sooner but decided to wait 10 years or more.
LabourUK,37hgoc,Kingy_who,3,Thu May 28 08:38:19 2015 UTC,"We should take this as a victory, the policy will go through, it shouldn't matter who is in government when it does."

Edit: HuffPo has been quick off the mark with an article: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/05/27/trade-union-levy_n_7450078.html   But it will also introduce a revolution in the way unions pay their 'political levy', replacing the current 'opt-out' system with a new requirement that individuals will have to 'opt in' instead.  The Tory manifesto pledged the party would include “a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions”. However, the background note to the Queen's Speech makes clear that the new bill will introduce “a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of of trade union subscriptions”.   Pretty short sighted of the Tories; if they do this, they must know that retaliation is coming their way the moment Labour is back in power. Attacking another party's funding so directly is just an invitation for mutual assured destruction."

I suspect that the structures of the party are so ossified that it'd be difficult to really adopt their model.

Doing a deal with the devil and losing their centre credentials last time is what ended up reducing them to the smoking rubble they are currently. I mean, I personally would work with the LibDems, but I just cant really see how it could be done without either telling the party to accept its defeat and join us, or splitting the vote inadvertently."
LabourUK,37c37w,TrickyDickNixonbot,4,Tue May 26 15:11:16 2015 UTC,We really need to asses our attitude to other centre/left of centre parties.

LabourUK,37c37w,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Tue May 26 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"Formal alliance is not in the best interests for both sides.  Many parts of Britain in which parties work together at a local level, even the house of commons often votes which are won due to cross party support. Lords being another obvious example with being many lords who are cross bench.  South west your be shocked to learn has some Labour zones within it.   About a week ago I was invited to meet up with some Lib Dem activists.  Lovely people we share the same sort of views at a local level but different at a national level.  Wanted to meet them so I saw another point of view and views on issues impacting the area.  Worth pointing out that Labour and Lib Dems councillors for my area did work together during the 90s.  Based on the demographics Labour could win this Tory seat or Lib Dems.    Instead we should focus on having strong grass roots and making sure Local parties have the power to do whatever they see fit. Independent councillors without any party behind them now make up Frome's town council.  Complete wipe out that was an independent group of people who was driven by local issues.  So don't think the South west is an unbreakable fort ;)  We face a fight from many fronts and have to give the message to every group.   So many things which could happen in 2020, should be open to any deals but complex path of issues."
LabourUK,37c37w,LocutusOfBorges,3,Tue May 26 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know very much about local politics, but I broadly I agree - give local parties as much freedom as possible to do what they want. General-election-wise, however I disagree. I think I do see what you're saying; that we should try and reach out to voters in Lib/Con marginals and be elected on our own merits, but after trying this strategy for a while it's for the most part failed.   I mean, if the Lib-Dems are sufficiently close to us ideologically that we're not completely selling-out our principles (which if Farron moves the party to the left I don't think we would be), and there's a seat where we're never going to get in (take Frome as an example - the highest we've ever polled there was in 1997 with 16.3%), I think pulling our horse from the race and endorsing the LD candidate makes the most sense - similarly I think that the Lib-Dems could pull-out of some of our key marginals with the Tories and endorse our candidate. What would happen in Lib/Lab marginals, or seats that we genuinely stand a chance of winning in, I don't know, but as a result of FPTP I think not having an agreement would only be doing each other harm."

Part of the reason the trade union leaders oppose democratisation of their own institutions is they'll be forced to ditch their control over what their vision of a pro-worker Labour Party is (one that usually panders to their special interests), and be forced to accept a Labour Party actually representing the views of working people. The trade unions are lions led by dinosaurs."

LabourUK,37buia,JustAhobbyish,2,Tue May 26 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"To me it would make most sense for Labour to support the existing cross-party campaign with the Electoral Reform Society - they advocate STV, which I happen to prefer anyway.  Also, if Labour put its weight behind that campaign, it would do wonders for the party's image as an 'establishment' party, while showing confidence and will to persue a change that is in the interests of democracy, but not necessarily in the party's interests.

Considering the PLP were given a free hand to do what they wanted on the issue (no whipping), and considering that even the Lib Dems had slated AV in the past, that's not at all a bad support rate.

Tax avoidance was a national pastime, their public sector was massively bloated and people routinely held jobs but did little or no work.  Closed professions were also a serious problem which caused massive price inflation compared to the rest of Europe. Truckers, pharmacists and those wishing to join 68 other professions had to buy one of a limited number of licences costing 500,000 euro or more.

Arguably the Euro played a role in all, it helped in some places but not in others, and none would have survived without Eurozone bailouts.

LabourUK,378wtp,TrickyDickNixonbot,1 point,Tue May 26 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Given how borrowing costs are so low why not use that to invest thing various things which need to be replaced or done?   Companies can only grow if they have infrastructure, UK has had declining investment for some time now as a trend that not good.  Not just talking about public investment but companies are spending less on training and equipment.   Moving towards a rent seeking economy does not bring growth or low investment."

LabourUK,378j0p,TrickyDickNixonbot,2,Mon May 25 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"TBH I'm not hugely enthused by the whole field.  Burnham will always be painted as too close to the Unions, Cooper, also close to the Unions, is inextricably linked to Balls and that will always be used as a mighty weapon against her - both will quickly be painted with the failings of the Blair and Brown cabinets they both bore collective responsibility in.   I haven't enjoyed Kendall's stridency thus far, and am a little more swayed by Creagh. I do think it would be valuable to have a female leader and someone who represents a Northern constituency with irish roots would do very nicely in terms of drawing a contrast against Cameron and Osborne. She can speak to a geographic area in which we have start performing well from experience, and speak with authority on the EU. Reading a little of what she's written in the press it appears she 'gets' Scotland.  I like her position on business, she's good in the Commons and lands punches well, her background means she would be taken seriously on the EU and its is difficult to assail her with the usual 'metropolitan-elite' attacks despite her Oxbridge education."

Or a competent one they can somehow paint to the wider world as incompetent, anyhow.  I wouldn't let the shambles of anti-austerity reaction outside Labour rule out the possibility of a good, strong, anti-austerity candidate.  And besides, again, we're talking about 2020, not 2015—I wager anti-austerity will be much more palatable up and down the country in five years."
LabourUK,3702h4,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Sun May 24 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"we're talking about 2020, not 2015—I wager anti-austerity will be much more palatable up and down the country in five years.   Didn't we say that five years ago?  Austerity is only really a label for current Government policy. After five years of it, we are still running a deficit. Many say that this means what we have is not really austerity, just a gradual reduction in spending. A Labour government should run a surplus, shouldn't it? It doesn't need to eliminate the debt (as long as that's going down), but you can't spend more than you take in, and they're limited in what they can tax if they want growth. People believed this in 2010, this year, and they will in five years time. I suppose it comes down to what anti-austerity means to you exactly. But we have to remember that it's all pointless if it will only ever be a position made from the Opposition benches."
LabourUK,3702h4,tusksrus,3,Sun May 24 09:45:18 2015 UTC,"Generally I agree with your sentiment- that we need to keep spending sensible- but technically you don't need to run a surplus to do that. Surpluses are not all they're cracked up to be, and there's a reason they're not common throughout the world. A deficit that has the nominal debt growing slower than GDP has the effect of lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio over time, and is usually what most countries aim for.  Ultimately, Labour should be Keynesian (and usually is)- and should aim for debt shrinking as a proportion of GDP during the boom years, and spending increase during the doldrums. This is fairly consistent with both Brown/Darling's 2010 plans, and Miliband/Ball's 2015 plans, and any sane leader should be promising the same in 2020.  Promising ""austerity forever"" as the Tories are, or ""spending that never ends"" as some on the left would prefer, are both as economically illiterate as each other."
LabourUK,3702h4,Patch86UK,2,Sun May 24 09:52:52 2015 UTC,Here is a chart that may be of some interest:  Right here  Take note of the big pile of debt left after WW2. Then note the steady decline in national debt during the post-war consensus of social democracy....Then note how the line goes all wavy after 1979...
LabourUK,3702h4,CaptainHayashi,2,Sat May 23 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"I've signed it.  I'm unsure where the best balance is for the party (certainly I think it's left of Miliband, not right!), but we at least need a stronger anti-austerity voice in the leadership election and throughout the party echelons.  For debate's sake if nothing else.  EDIT: Me again, looking at past me here and judging him on his insistence on at least drinking a bit of the Tory austerity kool-aid.  I don't know, I absolutely hate austerity but I also think that the circumstances of 2015 made ‘austerity lite’ look a bit more credible to me.  But this is about 2020, and I think that in 2020 the political climate will be ready for less concession and more hope."
LabourUK,3702h4,Zephine,2,Sat May 23 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's why the SNP rampaged through Scotland. There was a time where labor and the conservatives were left vs right. With miliband it was center vs right and Murdoch still managed to pass him off as an extremist left wing politician.   I haven't heard any true left wing statements out of any of the potential leaders though, the future is looking bleak."
LabourUK,3702h4,Duke0fWellington,2,Sat May 23 18:28:47 2015 UTC,I don't thats the only reason why the SNP were successful at all. There has always been anti austerity groups in Scotland. They have succeeded due to nationalism and Scots feeling disconnected from Westminster.

LabourUK,3702h4,TrickyDickNixonbot,1 point,Sat May 23 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"I just really don't think Labour's total insistance on lowering spending year on year was a wise move. Sure they were protecting certain areas of spending but, my point of view at least, left the specifics of where they'd swing the axe fairly vague. And the point is they shouldn't have been cutting at all. Economics isn't a zero sum game. A government can be running a solid deficit and reduce the debt in real terms. Of course, all-spending all-the-time is nonsensical too, but when so much of the economy is crying out for investment as it is now I really don't think any degree of austerity is the appropriate course of action."

He uses a quote of Diane Abbott's where she was clearly exaggerating to make a point, to tar all those who are against Blairism with the same brush.   There's more than the Iraq war to hate about Blair. Mandelson and Campbell admit in their first term they were more interested in headlines than reform and this carried on for all 3 terms.   I'm not sure any critic of Blairism actually thinks a return to it would mean war crimes. But the eroison of civil liberties, privatisation and Blair's attitude towards business was all wrong. I'm not saying you shouldn't be pro-business, but there's a fine line between being pro-business and anti-worker and for me Blair crossed it.   What is a myth though is Labour losing the election because they were too left wing and that modern day Blairism would be remotely centrist.   Labour didn't defend their record on the economy and people didn't trust them not to go into coalition with the SNP. Labour were still backing right-wing policies like workfare and Ed Miliband had went from saying he was a socialist at the start of his leadership to telling one-nation Tories ""I'll be your champion.""   Labour's campaign strategy was all wrong, they tried to rise above the Tories spin, and it worked for a time, when they were attacking Ed personally. But when they moved onto the SNP people listened and Labour gave nothing in return. People will talk about the clever tories but it was them bricking it going into election night.   One of Blair's main promises was that he would get rid of the sleaze from politics after Major's embarrasment of a government and he failed to do that, instead we got as much sleaze with added war crimes.   To return to Blairism would show no lessons have been learned from Scotland, you can't take advantage of Labour strongholds, they will leave Labour eventually.   For me even if Blairism was proven to win the next election for Labour, what's more important, winning an election or actually standing for an alternative to the tories?"

I do think that outside of the sleaze and awful foreign policy, Labour did do some good things during the Nineties and Early 00's.  The Tories have to some extent seemed to have come to some kind of peace with Thatcher, and to some extent still support her policies, which as we can see has worked for them.    I guess that could also be to do with time, quite a lot of time has passed since Thatcher was Prime-Minister, and people can be fickle.  I would rather not see the Tories in power at all, but like you said, what's the difference if they're just the same as the Tories?  Hopefully Labour will be able to get things together and become a real opposition over this Parliament, it's still early days and later in June we'll have the Leadership contest, we'll have to see where that goes."

LabourUK,36uoho,JTW199,4,Sat May 23 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't agree enough with your sentiments. From an economic standpoint I think emphasizing the fantastic potential of economic stimulus targeted on infrastructure and construction would be a good idea. Labour (employing lots of people) and resource intensive (using a diverse range of materials) jobs like building railways and houses not only give a great boost to the economy in the short term but also facilitate economic expansion in the long term. Plus that would ease off the strain on the housing situation... it's good for the economy and can make low cost homes a reality for millions of people. All of which could be financed at government borrowing when credit is historically cheap, raising taxes a little if you like (the really crazy Keynesians like the 1970s Tory Chancellor Anthony Barber went for the raise spending and cut taxes line)...and inflation isn't even on the horizon. With that in mind closing tax loopholes and Falklands/West Sussex oil are just bonuses. The possibilities are really quite wonderful. Once the economy was growing more long-term dedicated investment in, for example, education could be introduced too.   Add to that a mix of political reforms along the line of proportional representation, campaign finance reform and recall elections and you have something truly great I think.    On a more light-hearted note, can we please start calling the ideology of the current candidates Timewarp Labour?

In this case, I'd go for the broad region to the economic and social left of 2015 Labour, either holding that general policy direction (which isn't really left-wing in the first place) or shifting it further away from New Labour economically and Blue Labour socially (both of which seem, rightly or no, to be the wellspring of the current candidates' policy).  There isn't much defence of (say) state intervention, free school/academy abolition, and firm-but-fair toughness on business floating around on the table at the moment.  We could also do with some challenging of the narratives on immigration and deficit reduction too.  Not necessarily to win the leadership, but to shake things up at the top level as much as possible."

LabourUK,36uoho,Subotan,4,Fri May 22 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Watching question time with Tristram Hunt last week he was saying how labour lost because they weren't center enough. I was so disappointed that it came to that. Labour lost because they weren't left enough. Continuation of austerity  high tuition fees are not leftist policies.   If we stand in the center, people will see us as a tory-lite party. That's exactly what happened this election. The SNP stormed through Scotland because they posed a real true left alternative. The greens surged in votes in the south because they had true left policies, albeit lost many voters to tactical voting. We need labour to return to being the true party of the people, scrapping the flawed theory of trickle down economics and implementing trickle up economics which really works. I for one will be leaving the labour party if they keep trying to compromise with conservative-lite policies."

Labour is never going to beat the Tories at their own argument, and why bother when austerity is so obviously flawed?

There are two solutions to this.   First, there is the trickle down theory, this is the conservative mantra. Give more money to the rich through tax cuts and they will invest that extra money in new jobs for the lower classes, reducing unemployment. There are countless economic experts who have refuted this theory.  The other solution is giving tax cuts to the poor and increasing minimum wage, trickle up economics. The poor have more money to spend on luxury products, such as a house deposit, new car, TV, luxury foods etc etc putting more money into firms and in turn more money into government revenue through VAT and corporate tax. This method works. This is what labour should be endorsing.  You seriously believe that an £8 minimum wage is too left wing? Considering that is the living wage, it should be a conservative policy, offering the bare minimum for comfortable human survival without luxury.  You have not made one coherent argument as to why miliband was left wing (which he wasn't), I'm interested to know why you think that."

This smear that anyone who disagrees with you internally within the Party is secretly a Conservative voter is absurd and entirely dishonest. Further, whilst I'm politically literate and know exactly why I am a member of the Labour Party, how on Earth do you think you're going to be part of the team which gains a Parliamentary majority when every time you meet someone you disagree with you sneer at them and ask them whether they should vote for the other Party.   You seriously believe that an £8 minimum wage is too left wing?   I know that the minimum wage is a bad inferior policy and that we would do better to finance redistribution by the State through tax credits and other fiscal transfers, rather than privatizing it to be done by companies. If you actually asked any economist about the minimum wage they'd explain it's a bad policy, not because it necessarily causes job losses (it doesn't) but because it's incredibly inefficient at doing what it's supposed to do (raising the living standards of the poor).   You have not made one coherent argument as to why miliband was left wing (which he wasn't)   Oh come on.   I'm interested to know why you think that.   The entire strategy of the Labour Party in 2015 was based on the assumption that Britain had moved to the Left, beyond New Labour, and that Labour could position itself Left-wing enough to scoop up a majority out of 35% of the vote. It was clearly a Left wing manifesto and campaign."
LabourUK,36uoho,Subotan,2,Sun May 24 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"I was being genuine. You sounded like your views aligned more with the Conservative party, and you've seemed to reaffirm it in your reply. Whilst completely ignoring the solutions to better standards of living for the poor, your interpretation of the minimum wage can only be akin to Friedman and the free market bandwagon. I'd really like an explanation to that, if you have time.  People working on minimum wage right now would be payed less if minimum wage didn't exist. The whole point for maximum return on 'unskilled' jobs for firms is to pay them as little as you can whilst keeping them in your employ. Are you saying that removal of the minimum wage will allow firms to distribute the money better by giving more to some and less to others? It doesn't make any sense.  If you really believe that the free market (no minimum wage) can allocate wages maximizing welfare then you're arguably more right than the Tories, factually. I don't mean that as a slander or anything, I'm being genuine. If Cameron proposed to abolish the minimum wage he could expect a good 75% of his backbenchers defect instantly.   The entire strategy of the Labour Party in 2015 was based on the assumption that Britain had moved to the Left, beyond New Labour, and that Labour could position itself Left-wing enough to scoop up a majority out of 35% of the vote. It was clearly a Left wing manifesto and campaign.   You're right, but can you give me one left wing policy they had? I doubt it, because they don't have any. The closest thing to left wing they had was the abolition of extortionate zero-hour contracts which is more of a center policy if you ask me and other socialists.

Just look at HSBC's startling intervention in the election campaign - it feared a backlash from no one. An EU exit will lead to the serious players leaving en-masse. Preparations for such an exit are well underway at a number of companies I work with.  We sold Oxford, Cambridge and Sandhurst to the children of dictators and international students when we ceased properly funding higher education. Every university is entirely reliant on private funding and income obtained outside government to stay alive.  We are almost exclusively reliant on private finance, charity, visitor centre income or EU funding to preserve our world heritage and nationally important sites. I had a conversation with English Heritage last year seeking emergency help with a literally collapsing 400 year old listed monument - no money, unlikely to be any money for a decade, I was advised to apply to the EU or the lottery 'thats all we do'.

She seems reasonably well aligned to me politically while also seeming like the most likely candidate to win a general election.   We lost our shadow chancellor ... but most people thought we had lost our balls before the election.   I'm a sucker for stupid one-liners.  She recognizes that Labour should support an EU referendum (it would be silly to oppose it now it's happening anyway - obviously), though she's hardly the only candidate to do so.  She's said that that energy price freeze lie of Miliband's was not believable (it wasn't), that the Government should back any successful school (it should), that the pledge to reduce tuition fees should not be a priority (which it shouldn't; particularly as it misses the point completely).  It's sad that you might be right about her not securing enough support from the Parliamentary party - and the membership might not back her either. The most important thing to me is to keep Andy Burnham as far away from the leadership as possible (since I want a Labour government in 2020), so would support almost anybody (save maybe Dennis Skinner) with a view to keeping him out.

LabourUK,36s0cq,CaptainHayashi,3,Fri May 22 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"Reddit for some reason isn't letting me respond directly to /u/tusksrus, so I'll try here.   But isn't lowering tuition fees to £6k a nonsensical policy which should be dropped, and indeed not have been made in the first place?   Why?  Chasing the student and potential student vote is useful for Labour, and I imagine the hope was it'd help them mop up Lib Dem student vote.  Given the fury at Nick Clegg for U-turning on tuition fees, backing the current set would be suicide for Labour in this demographic.  It also makes sense to drop the fees down to a level where more people will actually repay their loans—currently the fees are so high and the repayment terms set out as such that it's very, very likely for students to drop out of payments having left the government with a loss on their loan.  And, for people in love with the word ‘aspiration’, what's less aspirational than having to accrue a huge amount of mortgage-sized debt in order to get a bit of paper, necessary for nearly all the ‘aspirational’ jobs, that you'll spend the next two decades paying off?  (Full disclosure: I am a student, albeit one on the pre-2012 £3k loans book, which the Tories appear to want to sell off again!  Happy days.)"
LabourUK,36s0cq,tusksrus,2,Fri May 22 11:01:17 2015 UTC,"Why? Chasing the student and potential student vote is useful for Labour   So why not instead offer a policy that helps students? Tution fees aren't paid up front unless you're wealthy enough to not be voting Labour anyway. The policy will only save the wealthiest graduates money in a couple of decades' time. It is totally irrelevant.  Offer more generous maintenance loans and grants instead. Something that actually affects students. Why do we get so hung up on the fees? They are the least important part and it's totally political positioning because of the Lib Dems' broken promise, rather than a policy with the aim of helping students.  Students know this.   I imagine the hope was it'd help them mop up Lib Dem student vote   They already have it - and it's such a marginal vote as to not be worth chasing anyway. Labour has and always has had ""the student vote"".   It also makes sense to drop the fees down to a level where more people will actually repay their loans—currently the fees are so high and the repayment terms set out as such that it's very, very likely for students to drop out of payments having left the government with a loss on their loan.   But by lowering the fees we're having the same effect as everybody not being able to pay back their final 3k. What is the point? It only loses money. A graduate tax is preferred, but reducing the fees only makes things less fair. It only saves money for the rich. And this is a Labour policy?   And, for people in love with the word ‘aspiration’, what's less aspirational than having to accrue a huge amount of mortgage-sized debt in order to get a bit of paper, necessary for nearly all the ‘aspirational’ jobs, that you'll spend the next two decades paying off?   It's not really debt. It doesn't behave like debt. It doesn't affect your credit rating, you don't have to make repayments regardless of circumstances, and the amount you repay is in line with how much you earn and paid before it goes into your bank account. You don't have to repay it at all after a fixed time and interest is charged in line with inflation. To call it debt, while technically correct, is dishonest. It is much more like a graduate tax with a maximum payable amount.  I really didn't like this pledge to reduce fees to £6k and it really summed up everything wrong with Miliband's leadership. It was a bad policy (which they hoped would be popular), but more importantly it was a bad Labour policy. It should be dropped. It should never have been made."
LabourUK,36s0cq,CaptainHayashi,2,Fri May 22 11:09:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, fair comment.  I guess the question then is that, if students are focusing on the wrong thing, then 1) are they really, 2) why, and 3) how can we fix that?  Because the average student isn't interested in why money spent to cut their fees could be spent elsewhere, they just want fees down gone (and sod the practicality of doing so).  One point I will hang up on, though, is that, unlike an actual tax, the government can (and this one wants to) sell off the loanbook to a much less scrupulous private debt collection firm.  Then, given that it's AFAIK left quite a vague set of fixed requirements on how the loans are repaid, things get much hairier.  What is your opinion on fees in general?  Should they theoretically eventually be cut as a low-priority policy if the government can afford it (and thus this policy was just bad prioritisation)?  Or are high fees (and low direct university funding) justifiable?"
LabourUK,36s0cq,tusksrus,1 point,Fri May 22 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"I guess the question then is that, if students are focusing on the wrong thing, then 1) are they really, 2) why, and 3) how can we fix that?   I'm not sure students are focusing on any issue at all - it's the Labour party which saw the Lib Dems' broken promise and saw a nice and meaninglessly populist way to appeal. A big part of Labour's strategy was to appeal to disaffected Lib Dems. What they didn't count on was that there are relatively few lib/lab marginal seats - most are lib/con seats. Where did the Conservatives gain most..?   One point I will hang up on, though, is that, unlike an actual tax, the government can (and this one wants to) sell off the loanbook to a much less scrupulous private debt collection firm. Then, given that it's AFAIK left quite a vague set of fixed requirements on how the loans are repaid, things get much hairier.   This is definitely a good point and the main reason to oppose the fee and loan system in principle. It's worth mentioning that lowering tuition fees by £3k doesn't significantly impact on this problem - it misses the point (again). Which brings me to the next paragraph.   What is your opinion on fees in general? Should they theoretically eventually be cut as a low-priority policy if the government can afford it (and thus this policy was just bad prioritisation)? Or are high fees (and low direct university funding) justifiable?   A graduate tax is a better option, and what we should move to. I think it's entirely fair that those who benefit from a University education should pay, effectively, a marginally increased rate of income tax (always as long as it's progressive like income tax and like student loan repayments). The current system does do that, but the point you make in your second paragraph is the main reason we should move to a graduate tax.   Lowering fees, though, is not the solution and only benefits the people who end up making the most money post-University. Apart from what you rightly say about the ability to sell loans, what we have at the moment is a graduate tax with a maximum payable amount (which is more beneficial to graduates than a ""real"" graduate tax would be). It just didn't make sense for the Labour party to promise to reduce fees - and Kendall would be right to scrap it."

From the poll:   Their biggest doubts about the Labour Party were spending and the threat of the SNP. Just 8 per cent of this group say their biggest doubts included that Labour is ‘hostile to aspiration, success and people who want to get on’.  Labour’s competence gap appears partly explained by the perceived legacy of the last Labour government. Just 27 per cent of voters think Labour has a good track record in government.  By 42 to 22 voters thought Labour was too soft on big business, not too tough; rising to 50 to 15 among voters who considered Labour. By 46 to 35 voters thought Lab should increase taxes on the rich rather than worry about driving investors abroad.  However, despite widespread concerns about Labour’s spending plans, more people said they believed the party were too tough (39%) rather than too soft on the deficit (34%).    So according to this poll, we need to be tougher on businesses, less tough (or the same as we are) on deficit reduction, don't need to worry about ""aspiration"" at all, but should absolutely worry about how people perceive the last New Labour government (poorly), and the SNP (scary).

I am not at all an expert, but it seems like the thing to do would be to present the party as centrist and competent, but with a small number of popular left of center agenda items to focus the attention of the electorate.

LabourUK,36t1sd,CaptainHayashi,2,Fri May 22 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think you hit it there with the SNP.  But does that explain the huge share of voters who see Labour as radical?  Maybe.  I wonder what you think about Scotland.  I think the battle is essentially over there.  Labour may win back a handful of seats but I think they are done getting 40-50 Westminster seats in Scotland every election.    Given that SNP and Labour are actually natural allies on many issues, a Labour government with SNP support (maybe informally) does make sense.  But it would have to be sold to the English and Welsh electorates in a way that doesn't scare them off.  How do you do that?"
LabourUK,36sy89,JustAhobbyish,3,Thu May 21 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"Most emphatically no thank you.  Her views on education are distressing, on defence somewhat jingoistic, and on public services worryingly ambiguous.  Mark Ferguson said of Kendall that 'I hope you’ll do what I did, and listen to what she has to say, because I think you’ll be impressed.'  I did, and am not."
LabourUK,36sy89,CaptainHayashi,3,Fri May 22 07:22:26 2015 UTC,I like her views on education what she is saying is if free schools work why not have them but make sure somebody is keeping a eye on them. But she does not want to roll out more of them :)  Defence is predictable means not very much I rather that 2% was spent well over just a target.
LabourUK,36sy89,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Fri May 22 07:59:49 2015 UTC,"if free schools work   They don't. There's no evidence that they or their kin in other countries improve educational standards and some evidence that they lower educational standards. In our case, the programme has unambiguously been a waste of money, opening schools in areas where none are needed.  So, you've got: Ambiguous evidence on quality of education; unambiguous evidence that they wasted money. This seems to me to be a no-brainer."
LabourUK,36sy89,mddc52,1 point,Fri May 22 10:08:59 2015 UTC,Current free school program was a mistake for so many reasons but we should not close the door on the policy which may have a positive impact.   Evidence points that costs us more money has no impact on performance of students as a whole.  Her comments are designed to allow the party to say it open to new ideas but only if they work.  Sweden not sure on the current status of the program but I think they are having issues.    Schools appear to be jumping on the free schools train due to getting extra funding if you ask me.  Which just tells me we should relook at the budget.
LabourUK,36spvv,JustAhobbyish,3,Thu May 21 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he doesn't need it.

LabourUK,36qar2,tdrules,5,Thu May 21 07:22:19 2015 UTC,AGREED.  I just can't help think Labour is stumbling into a place it doesn't need to be. I love the idea of having the interim leader whilst the party can have a proper debate. The changes that need to be made will take more than a couple of months.  No too worried about the 35 MP thing...
LabourUK,36qar2,itsdanprice,1 point,Thu May 21 08:56:39 2015 UTC,Its looking more and more like the IDS/Hague/Howard period where the Tories kept electing ideologically pure candidates because it didn't recognise that electorate had changed.
LabourUK,36qar2,toomanyairmiles,1 point,Thu May 21 11:27:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who didn't pay much attention to the contest in 2010, the idea that a candidate can hoard more than 35 MP's to stop others from having their voice heard is absurd."
LabourUK,36qar2,Patch86UK,2,Thu May 21 07:23:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it makes a certain sense to me. It's the process working as designed.  The whole idea of it is that nobody can be party leader if they don't have support from their fellow MPs. If anyone could put their name on the ballot without restriction (like with the London mayor candidates) you'd risk the party membership electing someone with no friends in the PLP- which would be a non-working disaster once the election is over. So to solve that, we say that the only people who can find 15% of the PLP to back them are eligible. If someone can't persuade at least 35 of their fellow MPs that they deserve to be on the ballot, they don't get on the ballot.  You could say to the MPs who want Burnham that they aren't allowed to back him now he's over the limit, but you can't force them to back someone they don't want to back. Each one of those backers knows full well that Burnham is safely over the line- if they can't be persuaded to back someone else, that tells you what their opinion is of the other candidates."
LabourUK,36q7d7,Patch86UK,2,Thu May 21 06:41:33 2015 UTC,"Some really fascinating stuff in there.   Their biggest doubts about the Labour Party were spending and the threat of the SNP. Just 8 per cent of this group say their biggest doubts included that Labour is ‘hostile to aspiration, success and people who want to get on’.   That torpedoes one narrative of the election- that we were ""anti-aspiration"". And the fact that the SNP might be ""wot lost it"" for us is extremely depressing.   Labour’s competence gap appears partly explained by the perceived legacy of the last Labour government. Just 27 per cent of voters think Labour has a good track record in government.   So much for the modernisers' ""let's just do what Blair did"" routine. It is not remembered fondly.   By 42 to 22 voters thought Labour was too soft on big business, not too tough; rising to 50 to 15 among voters who considered Labour. By 46 to 35 voters thought Lab should increase taxes on the rich rather than worry about driving investors abroad.   And there goes the ""we lost it because anti-business"" narrative, too."
LabourUK,36q7d7,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Thu May 21 07:25:17 2015 UTC,Why won't the prospective leaders actually listen to this common sense coming within and without the party?  Then I might actually back one of them…
LabourUK,36ltej,itsdanprice,3,Wed May 20 09:40:52 2015 UTC,"Ha, I knew he wouldn't manage to get the support he required. Plus his personal polling is so embarrassingly low, there was every chance he would have come a humiliating last in the popular vote.  Good for Kendall. Of the three Blairites who were mooted (her, Umunna and Hunt) she's the only one I would have been happy to accept as leader, even if she isn't my choice.  I just hope that Creagh manages to get her nominees now, to make it a four horse race instead of three."
LabourUK,36ltej,Patch86UK,6,Wed May 20 09:49:07 2015 UTC,The more I see of her the more I like her. I quite like Burnham - I just feel he is a bit too tainted with the past - both on economics and Midd Staffs - too easy for Tories war machine.

It's a shame Burnham seems to be the favourite to win, glad this contest will be a bit longer."
LabourUK,36ltej,JustAhobbyish,2,Wed May 20 11:39:05 2015 UTC,Overall I quite like Liz Kendall based on what she said at progress annual conference this year.
LabourUK,36ltej,HistoryLessonforBitc,1 point,Wed May 20 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"Her policy positions outlined in her Guardian interview were basically along the lines of capitulation to the Tories on most of their significant policies, specifically the spending twattery and welfare. All she would represent is us literally being Tory-lite, following the Tories' lead on things, accepting their spin and their contentions of reality (and therefore their ideology) and closing the Overton window further. She isn't a Blairite, Blair pushed back against a Tory narrative where it mattered and left clear water between the two parties, creating a new narrative; she wants to accept the Tory narrative wholesale.   If she becomes party leader while continuing this nonsense I will burn my party card. No joke."
LabourUK,36ltej,JustAhobbyish,1 point,Wed May 20 22:27:27 2015 UTC,Wonder what your view of the others is....  Not saying she is 100% right but I do like the fiscal tone so far.  Right now I view Andy burnham and Cooper as following the Tory narrative.
LabourUK,36ltej,HistoryLessonforBitc,2,Thu May 21 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"They all seem to be jumping on the ""Yes we did spend too much"" bollocks, for no other reason than its easier to adopt the Tory story everyone already believes rather than make your own or challenge that story in any way. Liz Kendall is a particularly good example, her platform is basically ""people voted Tory so we need to move to where the Tories are on everything""; others are only better by degrees. Burnham is currently least worst from my perspective, but that isn't a compliment by any stretch. I really want none of the fuckers if they're going to go down this stupid, self-defeating road of letting the Conservatives define the Overton window. I didn't join Labour because I wanted a Tory government with the serial numbers filed off, I joined Labour because I want more or less the opposite.   Kendall's fiscal tone really is just ""the Tories were right on the deficit"", despite the Tories being so categorically wrong on the deficit that to claim otherwise is moronic. It is playing to the electorate, rather than any form of principles or economic sense. It is justifying austerity. It is capitulation on something Labour could and should have been fighting before Miliband was even a name on a ballot paper. It is bollocks."
LabourUK,36ltej,JustAhobbyish,1 point,Thu May 21 17:41:03 2015 UTC,Looks like I need to read/view any Liz Kendall’s interviews.   And I agree so much on the deficit.

LabourUK,36ltej,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Thu May 21 18:04:33 2015 UTC,Hear hear.  I joined Labour because I thought that it was the true voice of progressive politics in this country... to see it facing down the barrel of a shotgun with its finger on the trigger is heartbreaking.

They don't see that we did that with Blair, and all it did was shift the centre of political gravity. If we do it again, we will just move it further to the right again. And then, when it fails (because Tory policy tends to in the long term) the Tories will claim it as another reason to shrink the state further and drag us along for the ride.  They can't see the long term damage it inflicts, both on public discourse and the party."

A membership drive is obviously an excellent idea. But alas, it can't be driven from the centre. Active, engaged local parties that reach out to their local communities would be a great place to start. If each CLP gradually attracted 200 more members, well there's 100,000 new members to start with. Probably a much more realistic target... Although still a huge ask."

It seems to me that the Tory media were more responsible for this perception than Ed was. Red Ed, in the unions' pocket, politics of envy, anti-business... none of these were true. He committed to maintaining Tory cuts, distanced himself from the unions, etc."
LabourUK,36k1x2,cylinderhead,2,Wed May 20 06:51:57 2015 UTC,"Seems like a fair and balanced assessment, but I don't think his explanation fully addresses our loss of support amongst many working class voters. The earliest data available suggests that we did only marginally better this time amongst skilled working class voters than we did in 2010, and that we continued to decline amongst semi-/unskilled working class voters. The obsession with winning the middle class is all well and good, but even in 1997 the Tories beat us amongst the ABC1 social category.  Mandelson has explained why we failed to appeal to middle-class voters, but he seems to overlook our failure to recapture working class votes. As Mandelson emphasises, our perceived economic incompetence and the Tories' rhetoric on welfare surely explains part of it in England, but it seems likely that immigration and other social issues played a big role, hence UKIP doing well amongst working class voters. And our collapse in Scotland to the SNP doesn't seem to fit his explanation at all."

LabourUK,36j6n9,Post_punk_lover,3,Tue May 19 20:15:01 2015 UTC,Labour is already in the centre. Continued movement towards the right will place it in the centre-right.

LabourUK,36j6n9,Post_punk_lover,2,Tue May 19 22:58:17 2015 UTC,Was it? The lib dems supported it at one time too. One policy does not equate to the whole party being left wing anyway.
LabourUK,36j6n9,rappersdo,1 point,Tue May 19 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"Tbh I wasn't really old enough/politically engaged to remember the intricacies of New Labour's policies, but removing the bedroom tax, banning zero hour contracts more than 4 weeks in length, creating more apprenticeships, employing more NHS staff and nurses, funding the NHS through a mansion tax, abolishing non-dom statuses and other things seemed pretty geared towards helping the people rather than the few, some of these are even at the 'expense' of the few - sounds pretty left of center-center-left to me. I also watched an interview somewhere of Ed saying he had plans of eventually turning Britain into a socialist nation."
LabourUK,36j6n9,Post_punk_lover,2,Wed May 20 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"The polices you mentioned are simply the popular left polices of the day that poll well. Whether or not Labour would follow through with them was another matter.  Blair ran in 97 with the promise to renationalise the railways and it didn't happen. Fact is Labour planned to uphold and bring in workfare, that's the polar opposite of left wing.  No Labour government reversed any of Thatcher's anti-trade union laws. Ed said he was a socialist at the start of his leadership and by the end he was telling one-nation tories ""I'll be your champion."" The failure of Labour is down to trust for me.   Miliband didn't gain the trust of the electorate that they wouldn't go into coalition with the SNP, as well as the public not trusting Labour with the economy after the narrative set up by the Tories.   If Labour stopped picking and choosing populist polices such as the ones you mentioned and actually stood for something across the board they might have done better.  Labour's image certainly isn't helped by shit like David Miliband, Mandelson and other Blairites coming out in the days after the elections with scathing and frankly appalling criticisms of Ed's campaign.   The Blairites talk the talk of not wanting a split in the party, but they've been the main agitators so far.   I've went into a rant and I could go on all day about what's wrong with Labour, but to get back to your original point, some of those polices aren't even leftist.  Creating more apprenticeships isn't actually a good thing, in principle they're a good idea, but they've now come to represent a way for any employer to pay someone less than minimum wage, they're supposed to be about learning a trade, but I've had mates do apprenticeships in hotel cleaning, it's utter bollocks."
LabourUK,36j6n9,rappersdo,1 point,Wed May 20 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"A hard-left policy would be confiscating the mansions and making them communal property, like the Russians and Spanish did. A mansion tax is pretty centrist."

LabourUK,36hl7t,CaptainHayashi,4,Tue May 19 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"I think the media's portrayal of Kendall as the heir to Blair is a bit simplistic. She seems influenced by Blue Labour thinking, at least rhetorically. She's been talking a lot about getting back in touch with Labour's roots as a voluntarist movement, rather than the 1945-94 state-based approach or the Blairite market approach. I don't know how that approach would translate into actual policy, but I think her ideology is more complex than pure Blairite."
LabourUK,36hl7t,redowl,3,Tue May 19 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all of them will be trying to play down their factional differences for the leadership contest. It is an election, and the winner is who gets the most votes- it pays to appeal to everyone, not just your own little tribe. Some of it will be more rhetoric than anything else- keep your eye on some of the meatier hustings to get a firmer grasp of where they actually stand.  That said:   I will tolerate no weakening of protections for working people or the basic rights of trade unions while I’m leader. If they’re implemented by this Tory government, the Labour government I will lead will reverse them.   If she's talking about the new anti-strike laws and dedicating herself to reversing them, that's nothing but a good thing."

This quote strikes quite true. It's not really about what Miliband was, but what people thought he was. The Red Ed moniker was a damaging one, even if it was daft.  On the subject of this article- some of the polls are interesting, on others they should know better. Some bizarre false dichotomies. ""Lower income tax"" or ""higher benefits"" okay isn't a choice anyone was being asked to make.

A public keen for someone to blame lapped up the message as it played into the general air of incompetence that had built up around Brown.   It remains to be seen if the current leadership cycle will allow the Tories to define us again, but the large number of candidates isn't helping."
LabourUK,36cz17,toomanyairmiles,2,Mon May 18 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"Labour lost control of the narrative back in 2007, Cameron and Osborne exploited the unwellness to counter it.  Worse still the series of scandals did not help, sense of intellectual arrogance from the commons did not help. Pretty much every party shared the same intellectual arrogance and thinking. Only that sort of thinking can be correct leading to some serious intellectual stagnation. Deep arrogance that we're masters of the world and nothing is going to go wrong.  Labour needs to admit it own part of this intellectual failure but just that part, Tories are unwilling to do that and Lib dems was willing to ignore what some within the party admitted for power.   Arrogance carries on that was a one in a life time event and won't happen again. UK now is facing even stronger headwinds without a air bag, the Tories may regret their narrative it won't happen again.    Labour needs to admit it own part of this intellectual failure but just part the party fiscal record is quite something.  Okay UK was unbalanced under Labour but that trend started years ago and not just Labour's blame.  Party needs to accept the unthinkable as possible and allow a series of thinking to become common within the party.  Acceptance of history means we can finally tell people history how it should read.  Instead of letting people to rewrite history and being forced to fight on their terms.   Tory party economic record is far worse compared to Labour.  We should be challenging them on the sand they have decided to stand and challenge their lack of vision along with failure.   Party needs to win this battle if wants to rule again and look at the vision first.  Keeping a eye out for the candidate who is willing to defend the record.   Candidates so far have given in to the idea of fighting it which is a mistake but some small rays of hope they understand what happen.  Media has not helped fueling anti intellectualism on economics as the truth.  Problem with the candidates so far they all sing to the same narrative which does not help.    Not a sign of weakness to admit your mistakes it a sign of failure to carry on making the same mistakes."
LabourUK,36dn2p,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Mon May 18 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think 'Post-Blairite' is perhaps how I'd describe myself. I think the Labour Party has correctly identified major problems within Britain (inequality) and the world at large (climate change) but has not provided solutions that the electorate could believe in. I think it's worth wondering what the Tories would do if they believed in fixing either of those problems and how Conservative-style policies for fixing, e.g., inequality, could be packaged as part of a platform that Labour could adopt.  So, how would we want to deal with inequality? Well, we'd attempt to constrain the market (price freezes, rent controls, a higher minimum wage); we'd redistribute through taxation; perhaps we'd even just let the trade unions do their job. And the public, to varying degrees, would hate us for it, even though it'd work.  What would the Tories do to deal with inequality? They'd encourage home ownership (help-to-buy, right-to-buy); they'd encourage share ownership; they'd -- maybe -- destroy monopolies in order to lower prices. There's absolutely no reason Labour can't do those things, and it would also, to some extent work. In fact, there's no reason we couldn't adopt a mixture of both hypothetical platforms, leaving the Tories with nowhere to go if they decided to tackle inequality while leaving us able to brush off criticism from the left that we weren't being left enough.  That's my post-Blairite platform: Doing what the Tories would do if they saw the world like we do."
LabourUK,36dn2p,JustAhobbyish,3,Mon May 18 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"I don't class the Tory party as Conservative in current thinking or even thinking ahead in fixing these problems.  So far the party appears to view it as needing supply side reform less rules to fix problems and leaving it up to the market to fix any problems.   Conservative-style policy for dealing with Housing crisis, remove the green belt reduce planning laws but strong focus on social housing being cheaper and private.  Move towards housing associations being the main supply of social housing no rents, public money goes to help fund the cost of keep up.  Green areas are added into the planning mix with builders working along side public funding to provide business zones and schools.  Builders don't have the funds they can go to investment fund to get the cash to build.   Inequality would be redistribute and correct the problem at birth.  That means creating a tax system which is efficient at collecting taxes and coming up with a series of policy which reduces overall inequality at birth.  VAT changes in which pretty much everything is subject to VAT at 15%.   Workers as a group are given a share within a company as a right and have a seat on the board.  Also bring forward plans for a higher minimum and ask trade unions to do their job.    Education you want workers to join training programs and companies to invest, so you link up with public colleges/uni to provide courses.  Companies get a major discount with extra public funding during recessions.   Some of these policies ideas come from Scandinavia, Germany and any other more equal nations.   Business taxes I would go with SMB 25% and bigger ones 35%.   Most markets are monopolies and not even markets with prices already confirmed.   When it comes to welfare we could be more efficient making sure people don't get trapped or we end up picking up the bill for mistakes.   We should be conservative with the idea change won't happen overnight but long term conservative plan is needed how to do it.   No reason Labour can't do any of these things and with their own vision but until we defeat some myths we can't."

LabourUK,36cuif,publicserviceradio1,4,Mon May 18 10:54:16 2015 UTC,"It's about time infrastructural nationalisation, or at least steps towards halting privatisation and putting public bids back into consideration, went back on the agenda.  Say what you want about the accuracy of opinion polls, but those ones are fairly decisive if even vaguely accurate.  Of course, general nationalisation is a bigger bone of contention :P  (hides from rest of subreddit with his hard-left views)"
LabourUK,36cuif,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Mon May 18 11:00:14 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with nationalisation is the lack of clear policy on what a good target for nationalisation is. Most people in the UK would agree that the NHS should remain nationalised, most also agree that Royal Mail should be nationalised (even though it now isn't). But are British Steel, Gas, Telecom and Rail valid targets for renationalisation? I'm not sure.  I lean towards nationalisation of networks (rail, telecoms inc. cable, postal network) with privatised services running on them where competition is possible. But then, structurally rail competition is impossible and the current regional set up is nonsense from a commercial point of view. Even if lines were shared it would be difficult to have true competition as there are limits in flexibility (i.e. we all want to get to work at 9am). But then you could apply the same argument to air travel. Then there is the NHS, very much not a network but very much a sensible nationalised service.  So what is a good guideline for a good/bad target for nationalisation?   I should add, I think there is value in nationalisation as a vehicle for improving competition, e.g. nationalised telecoms networks allowing for multiple service companies to compete on service rather than rely on their infrastructure advantage."
LabourUK,36cuif,mfitzp,3,Mon May 18 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"The idealist in me would ideally like as much to be (re-)nationalised as possible.  Of course, one has to draw a line somewhere, before things start turning into state capitalism or communist state-style total state ownership with complete prohibition of private venture.  Full nationalisation is an extreme throwback to Old Old Labour, and not even Attlee or Wilson pursued it IIRC!  However, resources and electorate patience limited as they are, I'd like to see things nationalised in a priority order, if and when they become feasible to do so.  The NHS, for me, would be the priority, as a vital service with ethical hang-ups over the profit motive.  Then, I'd probably go for rail—as you point out, the current system doesn't work, and no properly competitive system would work either, and the rail network is still a powerful element of infrastructure.  Royal Mail would also be nice to renationalise, though I imagine it would be very difficult to do in any way other than slowly buying up shares for the government (please excuse my lack of economics grokking!).  It's a vital universal infrastructural service, and there's a healthy market for competition in areas where different service is wanted (couriers, faster delivery, etc).  For me, renationalising or setting up state competitors to everything else Thatcher and Major sold off (National Bus Company, British Gas, British Telecom, British Steel, water boards, etc.) would be a nice bonus, but by the time any government gets this far down the list I imagine there'll be very little money, time, and public interest to pursue.  The model of creating a state competitor for currently privatised services might be interesting to pursue, I know something similar was on the Miliband manifesto for rail.  But, again, I know at best the value of things, but not their cost."
LabourUK,36cuif,CaptainHayashi,3,Mon May 18 13:19:38 2015 UTC,"I think some reform of the energy sector would be of high priority alongside the railways. The current crop of large energy companies act like a cartel, fixing prices and not passing on any falls in the cost of producing enemy onto the consumer through prices. People are just fed up with sky-high energy bills, and as the link shows there is a clear majority in favour of nationalising the energy sector.   While outright nationalisation is on the table, a state-competitor company could work too, and may be a more subtle approach. But either would solve the problem.  Also, stats like the one displayed in the link make me tear my hair out in incomprehension that some in the Labour party (MMAANNNDEEELLLSSOONNNNN!!!) can seriously be doom-mongering about the cataclysmic affects of a 'swing to the left' in adopting rational and popular policies like these."

LabourUK,36cuif,JTW199,2,Mon May 18 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"It always surprised me how eurosceptic the old Labour left were, and with good reason too (lack of democracy, mainly, IIRC).

LabourUK,36cuif,CaptainHayashi,1 point,Mon May 18 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Benn said it: ""We are at the moment on a federal escalator, moving as we talk, going towards a federal objective we do not wish to reach. In practice, Britain will be governed by a European coalition government that we cannot change, dedicated to a capitalist or market economy theology. This policy is to be sold to us by projecting an unjustified optimism about the Community, and an unjustified pessimism about the United Kingdom, designed to frighten us in.""  ""The EEC is really dominated by Germany. All the Common Market countries except the UK have been occupied by Germany, and they have this mixed feeling of hatred and subservience towards the Germans.""

LabourUK,36cuif,JTW199,2,Wed May 20 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"I started thinking about a state-competitor model too with comparison to the Royal Mail and the BBC. A state-run service with certain level of service guarantees acts to improve the rest of the market, as they have to meet that standard at least. The existence of the BBC continues to save us from the excessive advertising on commercial channels (just moved to the Netherlands and the amount of adverts on the TV is ridiculous). It's an interesting model: you could argue we have the same thing with the NHS. A base level internet supplier (guaranteed nationwide at X speed) would be beneficial to a lot of remote economies in the UK.  So, open network infrastructure (that can be equally used by commercial organisations) and state competitors in essential services?  Utilities (water, gas) etc. being privatised I find a bit bizarre. There is an absence of a real market (gas is gas is gas) and  obfuscated pricing. The one variant is if you want to buy more/less green energy, but then that's better decided as a national policy. I can't help but imagine that (like the NHS) getting rid of the marketing, etc. would save more money than competition has. But, it sort of works."

So I suspect comments like this are, as you say, him trying to appear relevant to his members.  All that said, he isn't wrong in what he said, and the fault lies in the failure of the party to bring the Unions with it as it progressed over the last 50 years. Something that's simply resulted in the Unions becoming more and more extremist as the party has moderated."

Would he be happy with Cooper, Creagh or Kendall?   My suspicion is that he is all talk and no trousers, as my gran would say. Whoever we get, he can claim he's sort of OK with them, but not so OK he can't continue to grumble.  He gets a vote just like anyone else, as do his members.

The persuader attempts to convince the respondent to comply by making a large request that the respondent will most likely turn down, much like a metaphorical slamming of a door in the persuader's face. The respondent is then more likely to agree to a second, more reasonable request, compared to the same reasonable request made in isolation.   The DITF technique can be contrasted with the foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique, in which a persuader begins with a small request and gradually increases the demands of each request.   While the FITD technique differs from DITF, it is also a persuasion technique that increases the likelihood a respondent will agree to the second request.

LabourUK,36768i,Patch86UK,2,Sat May 16 20:42:35 2015 UTC,"Question is how much pressure does this put on the Tory party, rushing into a EU referendum not good for Cameron but required given the timetable."
LabourUK,36768i,JustAhobbyish,1 point,Sun May 17 15:22:27 2015 UTC,The crux of it:   His minimum requirement to ensure Labour support for a deal would be that there should be a two-year ban on citizens from other EU countries claiming benefits after they arrive in the country and a clampdown on the undercutting of pay in the UK by European migrants.
LabourUK,36768i,sosr,5,Sat May 16 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Is the issue of benefits being claimed by EU migrants more perceived than real?   Firstly, the current EU laws allow migrants to stay and claim for 3 months only, then if they don't find a job they can be sent home. If people are going to work and contribute in taxes then is it common ground that they should stay? A blanket ban on all benefits for 2 years will make it very difficult for some migrants. Surely if you can get by for 2 years you are unlikely to need them at all. This I think will require a major change to the foundation Treaties of the EU. I'd say what we need to do is to properly apply the existing rules.  Secondly, EU migrants only account for 2.5% of working age benefit claimants. That includes in work benefits like Housing Benefit and Working Tax Credits. I'm sure if you asked people what they thought the figure was they'd think it was much higher. A bit like when you ask people to guess the proportion of non-whites in Bradford or Birmingham, but inversely.  Thirdly, there are quite a lot of UK nationals claiming benefits abroad. When you look at the numbers for UK nationals claiming unemployment benefits against EU nationals claiming JSA, there is only a small 'surplus' if you like of EU nationals claiming. Interestingly there are only 1040 Romanians and 520 Bulgarians. There are 14,880 Poles, but then there are 11,222 Brits claiming in Ireland. Figures are from here: http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu  Also interesting reading here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11255425/How-much-do-immigrants-really-claim-in-benefits.html  And here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25134521 (Q&A: What benefits can EU migrants get?)"

Either might not win in 2020 and if the Tories soften their approach a little and don't go to the right, with encumbrance effect of being in power it's likely they'll still win either way.  I personally think labour have go to go back to their principles rather than chasing voters. It might not win the election but it might save the labour party. We have to go more progressive."

There comes a point when ""strategy"" has nothing to do with it. I'm a Labour supporter, but I'm also a voter like anyone else. I'm progressive- if the Labour Party lurches to the socially conservative, me and those like me won't just nod along with it.

LabourUK,365xa0,JustAhobbyish,2,Sat May 16 15:04:45 2015 UTC,"In 1996, around four hours after registering at uni in Edinburgh, I found myself listening to Alex Salmond speak. All of the main parties had been invited to student hustings to encourage party registration but only Salmond turned up.  Already being a Labour member (grandson of trade unionists, I had a lifetime membership three months after conception) I was campaigning for the devolution referendum a year later. What I found was quite shocking. The branches barely met, had no policy ideas, and mainly operated as a poorly attended social club.   On the doorstep allegations of 'red tory' were common and you would really struggle to disagree with them - the elite of Scotland were all Labour voters and had no interest dealing with the extraordinary poverty on the sink estates surrounding the major cities or the complexities of life in remote communities.  By 1999 Dewar had returned from Westminster to lead the Scottish Assembly. He was a popular figure, but many in the party struggled with the fact that he had left Scotland for career, like so many other young people, and was only now returning for a coronation. Just like Murphy, Cook, Brown, Darling, the list is endless.  Listening to a friend who had gone to Scotland for the independence campaign describe the state of the party in Scotland it was clear to me nothing had changed. The leadership could best be described as the 'z' team, many in the party supported independence, the branches remained social clubs, and the members were disengaged from a campaign that had nothing to offer for Scotland but 'their figures are wrong', 'don't do something you'll regret'.  Alex Salmond wanted the referendum date, Cameron wanted straight Yes or No, Labour wanted DevoMax. Salmond and Cameron did a deal and placed Labour in a trap, and we walked straight into it without a second thought.   Neither Unionist party could present a positive vision for Scotland via a new Scotland Act so Darling waged an entirely negative campaign fighting for the status quo with vague promises of a new settlement after 2015. Communities were divided, friends and families stopped speaking to each other - a deep anger bubbled to the surface. Quite obviously the 'victory' was pyrrhic - literally bonfire of the vanities.  Parachuting in Murphy at the last minute with nothing new to offer was just more of the same garbage that Scottish voters had been hearing for the last half century and I'm not at all surprised it didn't work.  If Labour wants its voice heard in Scotland again it needs to be a voice from Scotland speaking to England fighting for Scottish issues and not the other way around. We need a strong Scottish Labour party that believes in the union and can say in a single sentence why the union is worthwhile. The exact same thing is true in Wales. If we can't provide those voices then independence should happen now."

One has to ask what the Scottish contingent of Labour MP's were working on for the last few years that was more important than working in Scotland?

LabourUK,365xa0,sosr,1 point,Sat May 16 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"Its very easy to say that, particularly with justifiable disdain for the other political parties involved.

I can't point to anything, can you?  I chuckle a little as I hear the millennial generation criticised for being selfish and self absorbed by a generation that bought them up that way, it throws the 'small britain' politics of the day into sharp relief. Everyone seems deeply concerned that someone else is getting something they're not. No one believes their voices are being heard or their issues attended to, I don't see the party offering a solution to that narrative as the different wings sharpen their sticks for the leadership election, merely playing to it."

But by this time people have seen the video, it's on the news and colleagues have started texting and emailing him pledging support.

The electoral system was tilted against the Tories through the last couple of decades because Labour and LibDem supporters in marginals were prepared to vote tactically to keep the Tories out, and many LibDem seats were Lib/Con marginals with the Tories in second place. All of that is over.  We lost votes to the Tories in former Liberal seats, to the Greens everywhere, and notably the SNP in Scotland. Liberal votes went Conservative en masse, and the remainder to the Greens. UKIP hurt us rather than the Tories, because we lost votes to them and their vote turned out to be softer than expected allowing the Tories to win. The Labour vote is being squeezed at the top, bottom, and middle.  In Conservative seats we needed to win there was a swing to the Tories, and in seats we already held there was a swing to Labour - we got piles of votes where we didn't need them and lost votes where we did."

LabourUK,361n2t,CaptainHayashi,4,Fri May 15 10:02:09 2015 UTC,"The Labour party is a broad chuch, problem is the PLP isn't. There's a handful of MPs who would describe themselves as socialist and actually mean it in the way you or me may think about it.  Once Labour loses its socialist voice Labour is lost, that's my view on it. Reforming the party in this image is a monumental task and as you'll see with TUSC, some feel it's beyond the pale.   For me as long as New Labour is left in the past there's a chance. People forget Blair actually promised the renationalisation of the railways and never delivered, that was New Labour's failing for me, it offered a centrist narrative with some popular socialist polices thrown in and never delivered on them.   Simply shifting back to Old Labour would be a disaster, and I agree Labour is best when it drops the gimmicks and unites.   I shudder when I hear terms like 'aspiration' in the way its used. Doesn't everyone aspire to get on? 'Wealth creators' is another one, the rich are not these benevolent beings that bless us all with their trickling wealth.   With Umunna now dropping out I feel a lot better about the leadership contest, and from what I've seen I believe Andy Burnham is the man to take Labour forward.  This video basicaly echos what I've been saying, and I know Burnham's far from perfect, and he's not even on the left, but I can't help but agree with his message, even if it is quite vague, he addresses all camps within the party and beyond, which is more than can be said for any of the other candidates.  I've gone slightly off-topic here but I agree that Labour needs to stop looking to old 'isms' and new gimmicks and focus on the future. The last thing we need is a Labour party at war with itself while the Tories could face an implosion any time in the next 5 years."

To add to what you've said, some political reforms like Proportional representation, recall elections and campaign finance reform would go well with that too.   With regard to challenging the neoliberal consensus, focusing on the opportunities of concentrated investment in infrastructure and construction (they offer the greatest fiscal multipliers if I remember correctly) would be the way to go there I think, along with plans to shift the UK away from its heavy reliance on the South-East financial sector and towards a mixed economy (and a passionate safeguarding of the defence budget? ...Personal taste I suppose). Also reiterating the point that economics is not a zero sum game, if you slash away at government spending you end up with a bigger budget deficit than you otherwise would've done with targeted economic stimulus. The oil from the Falkland Islands (and wasn't some found in West Sussex a few months back?) should be great.

Also worth pointing out that some of the most important innovations have been funded by the state.  Most of the technology behind the iphone came from American public funding on research.  And Germany workers have seat on the board along with shares.   Time for the neoliberal consensus to die in my eyes nothing short of a failure.

I assume you're referring to this:   On immigration and Labour’s trade union link, Ed Miliband’s leadership actually represented a shift to the right from the Blair years.   I think Owen specifically meant that Milibandism's opinions on immigration and trade unions were to the right of Blairism's.  And you can see why this has happened, if not necessarily agreeing—UKIP have set the agenda on immigration, and the right-wing media constantly hammered Ed for being the ‘union man’ ever since their vote edged him into the lead on the leadership contest.  I imagine Owen would agree with a shift back here, but I don't think he's arguing that everything else has moved to the right."

Bearing in mind some of our more left wing policies (energy market reform, railway franchise reform, mansion tax) were some of the only things we did that actually cut through with the public, it's not at all clear they were the problem. Even if the policies themselves change, I hope we don't completely toss out every interesting policy instinct we had in the name of chasing an imaginary centre."
LabourUK,361m8e,CaptainHayashi,2,Fri May 15 11:33:00 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't think there were many real stinkers in the policies (except maybe immigration, and we can argue about austerity til the cows come home, but both came across as unwanted compromises rather than flagship policies).  But there were many moments in the campaign that came across as just plain ill-advised (EdStone, the somewhat panicked approach to the SNP, the fact that the policies didn't even appear until after the Tories had already written the narrative of the election… and I know a few people were upset at Blair's public backing of the campaign too).  EDIT: Of course, some would probably put our business policies in under the ‘stinkers’ column.  For example, zero-hours contracts got a lot of stick from small business owners.  I'm not really sure whether I agree, certainly the intent was well-meaning but maybe the policies needed either tightening up or advertising better."
LabourUK,361m8e,JustAhobbyish,2,Fri May 15 11:59:49 2015 UTC,"Quite liked some of Ed Miliband's ideas nice long list of things he wanted to reform which needed to be dealt with.  Picture was painted that Labour was unsafe with the economy and would bring chaos due to the SNP.  Does not matter which policy ideas you have on the table if you don't challenge the narrative things are unsafe with you or chaos to come.  Like being called a murder and not challenging that asking if you can baby sit some kids may have some fantastic series of references but does not matter.   If you ask most people they don't ask if a policy is right wing or left wing or in the middle.  Still stand by the idea that most people won't disagree with wanting a fairer, greener world and simple along with progressive tax system.  If you look at the the Tories did they did not talk about the policies which most people disagree with but focus with stuff people liked.  Effective communication along with the message that things are best in their hands.   Labour needs to focus on the interesting engagement along with a strategy which takes them back to every voter group even the ones which don't vote.  If the no voters was a party they would be the biggest single party. Party needs the working class, middle class and old to vote for them along with the young voters to get into the habit of voting for them. Changing demographics means we need to focus on every group and can't take for granted any.   This may require some serious structural changes in how the party is run and speaking to voters. Along with a clear long term strategy to make sure we're part of the community again. Ed showed some real balls in speaking to Russell brand that just one step we need to take.  Populist parties are able to get some serious engagement with voters time for us to learn from them and the SNP. Not saying we should take on their own policy but look at how they run things.   Easy to say do but far harder to do it could be naive with a serious lack of experience but my read on it."

The problem with Labour chasing all those SNP and PC seats is that they will lose seats in England and in all likelihood won't even get the seats they were chasing anyway.   Winning elections is your bottom line huh? Commit whatever ideological double-standards or sacrifice however many convictions but as long as Labour wriggles its way into office that's all that matters? Clearly we're at an impasse here on whether Labour believes in anything other than acquiring power...  By 'PC' I assume you mean 'Politically Correct'. What are you trying to say here? Openly confronting austerity and instead going for a more economically sound plan of stimulus spending is politically correct? For someone chastising others for 'ideological pigeonholing' this is a laughable statement to make. What lost Labour seats in England was indulging the Tory economic line that 'Labour's profligate spending is the root cause of all our troubles' rather than confronting it and showing it to be the farce of an argument is actually is!    Talking about austerity is completely irrelevant. By 2020 it won't be an issue. You can't choose a leader for the 2020 election based on the 2015 election campaign.    How can it be irrelevant if the Tories are committed to making greater cuts in this Parliament than they did in the last Parliament?   Do people in Labour's northern heartland sit around waiting for the pits to re-open and the return of Scargill and Kinnock? Do they fuck, so stop treating them as if any shift away from a hard left position will result in haemorrhaging votes to UKIP.

No, I don't believe that is necessary. I believe that the convictions the Labour party should hold itself to should be positive ones, not negative ones. So for example, do we want to fight for (positive) the have-nots? Yes, of course. Do we want to stick it to (negative) big business? Personally, I think not necessarily. Yes, if they are dodging tax, exploiting workers, the environment etc, or whatever, but not just because they are a big business.  I don't think we have to have any double-standards, because I don't think they would contradict.    By 'PC' I assume you mean 'Politically Correct'   No, Plaid Cymru. The Party of Wales.   What lost Labour seats in England was indulging the Tory economic line that 'Labour's profligate spending is the root cause of all our troubles' rather than confronting it and showing it to be the farce of an argument is actually is!   I agree that is probably the biggest error in the campaign.   How can it be irrelevant if the Tories are committed to making greater cuts in this Parliament than they did in the last Parliament?   Because by whatever horrific means possible, they will slash spending to whatever woeful level required to cancel the deficit by 2020. The next election will not be fought on austerity.   Neither do they enjoy choosing between 'austerity' and 'austerity-lite'.   I think you might have misunderstood me. I don't agree with austerity or 'austerity-lite'. I think we could have stimulated the economy out of recession much quicker than the Coalition's austerity measures did. I don't believe the deficit has to be reduced by spending cuts, I think it can be reduced by growing the economy. My point was that I don't think the Labour heartland are so ideologically fixed that any perceived move to a more inclusive set of policies would result in them voting for someone else."

What we should do is learn from the SNP and how they been able to rise and get certain voters voting again. May be a good case for rethinking how Labour works within Scotland.   UKIP voters  This block of voters feeds into the next section and we should look at engagement.  Most don't feel like any of the other parties have the same sort of engagement with them as UKIP. UKIP voters are made up of a couple different groups but they all suffer from a lack of engagement.   Don't vote/left behind  This group again suffer from a lack of engagement and on average are likely to be Labour voters.   What Labour needs to do is convince voters that it serious about engagement with them and to start talking to them in a way which connects to them.  The number of voters who care about the SNP are far smaller compared to the non voting camp. We already seen that once the tone along with narrative rather hard to counter.  Best answer would be that we always had to work together parties always do.  Unsure that a convincing answer to that question which is hard to answer.

Old Labour - People who who occupy the left-wing of the party and wish to take the movement back to its socialist roots. They're advocates of strong trade union powers (and their traditional links to the party), a strong government hand in the economy (often linked in with nationalisation of some key industries, e.g. electricity and the railways), high taxes for the rich and a strong social safety net. These were basically the main points advocated by Labour politicians up until 1994, and they still enjoy a lot of support among the party faithful, but advocating for them too-strongly is often viewed as making the party unelectable.   2). New Labour (or the Blairites) - In 1994 Tony Blair took leadership of the party and felt that the party needed to broaden its appeal outside of its working-class heartlands by appealing to 'Middle England'. He did this by scrapping some of the more left-wing positions of the party (e.g. nationalisation and high-taxes), courting big-business, and accepting the laissez-faire system of capitalism Thatcher had brought about in the '80s. Labour won three majorities on the back of this ideology and much-needed investment was given to schools and hospitals, however many regard New Labour as having betrayed the party's traditional principles; income inequality continued to rise, many former-industrial towns did not get the investment they needed and a lack of regulation of the banks is widely seen as causing the 2008 banking-crisis. Some people, citing our electoral success during the 2000s, view this as the direction the party should head in order to win in 2020, but much of the party views it as needlessly selling-out.   3). Blue Labour - This one's quite new. It views New Labour as having betrayed a lot of its working-class support in backing neo-liberal economics and being too-light on immigration and welfare-abuse, seeing the erosion of our traditionally-solid working-class base by UKIP in key marginals as one of the reasons we lost the election. On the one hand they want to take the party more to the left (higher taxes for the rich, more market regulation, less privatisation etc.), but on the other want to take it to the right by being more tough on crime, the long-term unemployed and immigration.  The Labour Party's a very broad church and a lot of people hold views from multiple camps, or ones that I haven't discussed here at all, but I hope this gives you a very brief overview of what the views of the main groups are at the moment. Hope that helped!"
LabourUK,35virw,Moinmoiner,5,Wed May 13 23:35:53 2015 UTC,A good explaination. I think this will help people understand some of the debates that are going to be coming our way.
LabourUK,35virw,Omni_Shambles,2,Thu May 14 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much, I was more interested in things like progress and the co-operative party."
LabourUK,35virw,Patch86UK,9,Thu May 14 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"/u/Moinmoiner has already given a great answer, but I'll try with a slightly greater emphasis on organisations.  1) Progress is a think tank and campaigning organisation associated with Labour with a philosophy that closely aligns to Blairism and New Labour. Now that Blair is a bit of a pariah and New Labour isn't spoken about much, Progress is the key focal point for Labour people with a more centrist ""social democrat"" philosophy.  2) Compass is another think tank and can be thought of as the more left wing equivalent of Progress. It's misleading to think of this in terms of ""Old"" versus ""New"" Labour; Compass isn't really an organisation that wants to go back to Callaghan, but it is the organisation with more left wing views. Ed Miliband's policy platform was relatively aligned with the ideology espoused by Compass.  3) Blue Labour is a ""tendency"", the core of which is several books and publications by leading adherents. In some ways, it is quite an ""Old Labour"" ideology- arguing for left wing economic policies, but a more ""faith flag and family"" social policy which might appeal to those working class voters who find UKIP appealing.  4) Socialist Campaign Group is an alliance of backbench MPs who are on the left of the party who consistently argue for a more leftwing platform than the frontbench party. They are the direct successors to the ""Tribune Group"", who took their name from Tribune Magazine, a left wing publication that has been in and out of print over recent years.  Looking to some of the more historical groups:  5) The Fabian Society were one of the founding members of the big alliance that would become the Labour Party. They originally represented the middle class Marxist intellectual types, and drew their ranks from the academic and chattering classes in London and elsewhere. These days they are yet another think tank, and not so much a tendency in their own right. They often focus on ""big picture"" stuff- typical hobby horses include constitutional reform, market reform, party structure, etc.  6) The Cooperative Party are another one of the early founders of the modern Labour Party- originally a separate party with different ideological origins, that entered a permanent electoral alliance with Labour when it became apparent that Labour was becoming the dominant all-purpose left wing party. They exist today to represent the cause of mutualism- they are the vehicle by which money from cooperatives come into the party, and the origin of a lot of Labour's mutualism policies. They directly sponsor a number of MP and councillor candidates, providing campaign funds and allowing them to stand as ""Labour Cooperative"" candidates.  7) The affiliated unions are by far the largest organisations affiliated to Labour, representing some 3 million people. They are the third of the main founding groups of the party. The degree to which you want to view these as special interest groups in their own right depends on a lot of factors, but as the originators of large quantities of party funds and of votes in things like leadership elections, they are important. Usually the various individual unions are quite capable of speaking up for themselves, but there is also an organisation called ""Unions Together"" inside Labour to represent them as a whole.  Have I missed any?  It's worth pointing out that factionalism can be vastly overstated; most people (including frontbenchers) don't really think in these terms."

If the unions left Labour would never recover and the UK might as well be a one-party state.   The unions have poured money into Labour for a long time now, and they've got fuck all out of it, the fact that the tories are now able to pass such draconian anti-trade union laws without anyone from Labour condemning it shows what a sorry state of affairs this party is in. In a way I wish 'One member, one vote' hadn't been reinstated now.   It's got the right sentiment behind it but I fear many people will now cling on to the narrative Blairites are pushing that the only thing that matters is winning an election."
LabourUK,35tdkl,rappersdo,5,Wed May 13 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"In a way I wish 'One member, one vote' hadn't been reinstated now.  It's got the right sentiment behind it but I fear many people will now cling on to the narrative Blairites are pushing that the only thing that matters is winning an election.   OMOV actually increases the influence of the union members and the rank and file members (who are most likely more sympathetic to the unions) than the opposite. Previously one third of the entire vote went to the parliamentary party- the people who are conspicuous by their quietness on the current union laws. The changes that hurt the unions (preventing them from sending promotional material with the ballots, for example, or forcing voters to actively register their interest) aren't strictly to do with OMOV."
LabourUK,35tdkl,Patch86UK,3,Wed May 13 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the explanation. Who's your preference for leader if you don't mind me asking?"

LabourUK,35tdkl,Patch86UK,4,Wed May 13 12:35:27 2015 UTC,"You're a more fair minded man than I. I really think the party needs a kick up the arse to have a mind of its own, which can be distingused from the tories, rather than just 'move left.' 'Move right.'   Problem is I fear this is a popular opinion up north that is unilaterally ignored by certain sections of the party."
LabourUK,35tdkl,rappersdo,5,Wed May 13 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"rather than just 'move left.' 'Move right.'   I 100% agree!  In hindsight I think the election campaign was let down by a failure to challenge the Tories on the economy.   We could've been shouting about austerity not working; how the labour plan is better for everyone. Instead we heard the Tories slam Labour's government years and say ""we didn't do that and we can keep on being okay.""   That's not a left or right issue, its a campaign management one; we just missed were the deciding factor was for this election!   What do you think? I could be misreading this"
LabourUK,35tdkl,tusksrus,1 point,Wed May 13 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. Most people don't care about left/right, socialist/capitalist dichotomies. They just want a party that helps them!"

What use is a leader of a party who does not have the support of its MPs? It's the MPs he's supposed to be the leader of!"
LabourUK,35tdkl,tusksrus,6,Wed May 13 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"In some respects they do have a veto, in that they have to nominate candidates in the first place. Each candidate needs 15% of MPs backing them to get on the shortlist.  The leader is leader of more than just the MPs. They're leader of all the people funding the party and putting in the hours to win elections, too. And if a potential leader can't win an election with a couple of hundred thousand voters, how can they hope to win an election of many millions?"
LabourUK,35tdkl,Patch86UK,3,Wed May 13 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"Each candidate needs 15% of MPs backing them to get on the shortlist.   Well.. that's not really what I meant. I would have thought a candidate having the backing of at least 50% of the MPs before becoming leader would be a requirement... maybe the process of narrowing it down to two could have wider involvement.  You do make a good point in your second paragraph though. While I do appreciate the reality of how politics works, funding should come to the party because of its platform, rather than have the platform determined for the benefactors. The same for time and support. MPs should take all this into consideration.  I just don't think it's right for the Leader of the Opposition to not have been chosen by at least half of the people in the Opposition (assuming a totally two-party system which is where these terms come from). I just couldn't find them as credible."
LabourUK,35tdkl,tusksrus,3,Wed May 13 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"funding should come to the party because of its platform, rather than have the platform determined for the benefactors   I know what you're saying, but I'm not sure there's a big distinction. Labour survives only for as long as there are members willing to support it (in terms of time, money, and intellectual energy). People will only do that while the party and its leadership is doing things that they agree with. One way of looking at it is that Labour should do what its supporters say, or they'll leave. Another way of looking at it is that Labour needs to have a platform that is attractive to its supporters, or they'll leave. They both amount to the same thing.  Just look at the Lib Dems. They attracted millions of voters, donors and activists with a distinctly left-of-centre pitch. They thought that they could do what they like to that platform and the voters and activists would stick with them- they didn't. Now they've lost 80% of their MPs.  If the Parliamentary Labour Party had a free hand to choose anyone they want, they might pick the same person as the party at large would have chosen anyway (in which case, what's the fuss). But if they did the ""elders know best"" routine and picked someone the members didn't want, and pitched a platform that the members weren't happy with- they're not going to be members for very long."
LabourUK,35u6cw,AnxiousMo-Fo,5,Wed May 13 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"A pretty harsh article on the recent actions of some of those who call themselves left-wing but I agree with most of it. Moving forward we cannot allow this party to be influenced and defined by the actions of the few but we need to channel their motivation and energy to more constructive and useful actions.  Key quotes I agree with:   The incident neatly encapsulates psychological defects to be found in some parts of the Left. Not on all of the Left by any means but, sadly, on those bits that tend to shout the loudest and get noticed the most. The serious, quiet Leftists who have not lost their minds need to speak up and drown these crazies out. In many ways cyberland helps people to reach out, share ideas and discuss. But it also acts as an echo chamber in which a large but limited minority reinforce each other’s views and push each other’s emotions to cult-like levels of fanaticism. This election revealed that Britain is divided horribly by region and class. We lack solidarity. A Left that loves Britain should try to heal our nation and bring it together."
LabourUK,35u6cw,TrickyDickNixonbot,1 point,Wed May 13 15:24:08 2015 UTC,It's dead right about the online echo chamber. Have you seen the group called 'I'm backing Ed Miliband' on Facebook?

Particularly in hindsight it reminds us of the failures of this recent Labour party and the abhorrent actions of current right wing politicians. The title is perhaps a tad misleading, it's not a call for a 'revolution' as such but more of a call to arms for the working people.  Examples of topics raised:   The power and history of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, The Chartists, the trade unionists, the suffragettes and what we can learn from them moving forward. UKIP and challenging the populist right. Challenging the self-sustaining 1% in a supposedly 'booming' society to do more for the people."

My problem with the Blairites of the party coming out and saying we were too left wing is where were they during the election?   Campbell, Mandelson and D.Miliband all are happy to stick the boot in now but god forbid they back Labour during the campaign, the only Blairite who was forced to was Blair and he did so knowing how much of a divisive figure he is."

When you're in a safe Tory seat with no on-paper likelihood of electing a Labour MP, the CLP goal isn't just the cynical throwing up candidates to make up numbers.  A lot of what I've seen my CLP do instead is putting pressure on the local establishment, bringing up and being vocal about issues, and working from convictions instead of career aspirations.  This is how we can really pull Labour back from the brink of disaster.  If we can show to people that Labour isn't about winning seats, it's about making a change, then we strengthen the cause and existence of the ‘don't bother campaigning’ CLPs, we prove the ‘party politics is dead’ people wrong, and we get our message out early, loud, and clear.  I'm all for it.  (PS: I have to admit I felt it was rather cynical that most of Labour HQ's communications to me came in the form of ‘don't bother in Harrogate and Knaresborough, go and campaign in Pudsey instead’.  Yes, campaigning in marginals is very important, nationally we have limited resources to allocate, and without seats we have no mandate for national change.  But should we really throw small CLPs—whose role is almost entirely defined by activism, and trying in the passionate hope that one day we will get our MP—under the bus?)"

LabourUK,35s9np,BrianScalabrine_AMA,6,Wed May 13 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   Politically, Blair has been identified with record investment into public services, an interventionist and Atlanticist foreign policy, support for stronger law enforcement powers, a large focus on surveillance as a means to address terrorism and a large focus on education as a means to encourage social mobility. In the early years (circa 1994–1997), Blairism was also associated with support for European integration and particularly British participation in the European single currency, though this waned after Labour took office.   I'm a bit of a Blairite myself (RIP karma); I favour more business-friendly policies, an end to austerity, and I'm pro-EU. Blairism is much more centrist than normal Labour policy (it wouldn't look out of place with the Lib Dems), but there are still some things which are very Labour attached to the ideology."

In politics, as in life, these things rarely have a straight forward answer.  One interpretation is that in light of the eurozone crisis of the last few years, staying out of the euro was a smart decision for the UK as it shielded us from the worst of the harm. On the other hand, if we had joined the euro the eurozone crisis would have been considerably less dire (our economy would have been a significant chunk of the whole economic zone), and as the eurozone crisis effected us in serious ways anyway, having been inside and preventing the crisis might have panned out better for our economy too.  One of those hypotheticals that you could debate all day without necessarily coming up with any sensible conclusions. Suffice it to say, Brown keeping us out of the euro is something that eurosceptics remember him more fondly for."
LabourUK,35rcb3,TrickyDickNixonbot,7,Tue May 12 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Policy of austerity does not make any sense at all, Labour balanced operating budget made more sense compared to a complete balanced budget.  Worth pointing out that 60% of debt is owned by Brits and investment for the future.  And....worth reading http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/repeat-after-me-sectoral-balances-must.html   Economics is 90% common sense and 10% charts."
LabourUK,35rcb3,JustAhobbyish,3,Tue May 12 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"No, I'm with you on that one. The long-term goal to eliminate the deficit is obviously good, and their refusal to set a precise date for it was also good economics, even if it wasn't great politics."
LabourUK,35rcb3,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Wed May 13 08:28:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is money is historically cheap. We could be funding infrastructure upgrades, construction investment, small business grants and a list of other things to kick-start considerable growth in the British economy at essentially negative interest rates on government borrowing. Of course it would be targeted stimulus spending, I'm not going to suggest that more and more spending is always better, but in areas like infrastructure and construction there are significant fiscal multipliers to be had (the returns create wealth several times greater than the investment) which could take the British economy to new heights. Also, the issue of inflation isn't even on the horizon.   The reason I and many others complain about pandering to the Tory narrative and offering austerity-lite is because Labour never challenged the notion that 'reckless overspending' was the cause of the 2008 crash. A critically under-regulated banking industry was the cause of our troubles (on top of global financial problems). Instead they tried to match the Tories at their own game and buy into the illogical neurosis about the national debt and spending deficit by making ""year on year deficit reduction"" the baseline of their economic policy - taking the focus away from the possibilities of stimulus spending along with fixing broken markets (like the railways and the energy sector) and back to the ridiculous doctrine of austerity that seems based solely on the notion that asceticism is more morally upstanding.   To take one example, on  the privatization of the Royal Mail Labour could have ripped the Conservatives to pieces. Here was a public company offering a perfectly adequate service that was flogged on the cheap as a loss to the taxpayer, because the only thing that matters to the Tories is that it's privatized - they know the price of everything and the value of nothing... And yet Labour's response to the Royal Mail privatization came across as rather subdued.   Bringing it back to last Thursday's election, I truly believe that if Labour had offered a clear and coherent plan of targeted economic stimulus they would have done much better. Doing nothing to oppose the 'austerity-consensus' handed the Conservatives the victory on the economy debate."
LabourUK,35rcb3,JTW199,2,Wed May 13 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"Our stance on it was terrible. We simultaneously convinced those on the left that we were pro-austerity and those on the right that we were fiscally incompetent, winning over neither side."

LabourUK,35pwqw,JustAhobbyish,3,Tue May 12 15:21:19 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Personally I think there's grounds to be Eurosceptic on a platform that isn't, as the article seems to suggest, one based on ""xenophobia"" and ""racism"". From the outset I don't like the attitude Labour took towards a EU referendum - 'you can't have one because you might vote the wrong way' - imagine the howls of indignation if the same thing had been said about a Scottish Independance referendum?  Moreover, the European Union is in many ways an exceptionally undemocratic institution that seems wedded to the doctrine of austerity (or, at least, Germany - master of the Eurozone - is). You only need to look at the way Greece has been treated to see that. But the most glaring issue is that of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being negotiated by the EU. Now, there's an awful lot wrong with the TTIP (as this website here explains in more detail: http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/ttip-biggest-threat-uk-sovereignty.html) and the European Union had the arrogance to block the Citizen's Initiative Against the TTIP (as another article from the same websites explains in more detail: http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/ttip-eu-citizens-initiative-democracy.html).   Beyond this, I'm interested by the argument that outside the EU Britain could quickly launch into free-trade deals with emerging markets in India, Africa and China. I suppose in a way this appeals in a sentimental way to me, in as much as the opportunity to strengthen Britain's ties with Commonwealth countries.  Ack, I don't know. There are obvious benefits to it as well - but at the moment I'm not overly enthusiastic about the European Union... Just a thought."

LabourUK,35pwqw,AlmightyWibble,1 point,Tue May 12 17:51:55 2015 UTC,"UKIP founder has been pretty vocal on what he wanted his party to be and what it became.  Claimed many times that the party never had xenophobia at the core [Linked one not long ago from him let me know if you want me to share it] . UKIP public perception is goes against political correctness of modern times party does not promote xenophobia per say but hints at it. UKIP uses xenophobia as a way to make the party unique and get people thinking they are speaking for normal people. Peel back the message you get xenophobia playing to peoples fears and fear over austerity. Question is has UKIP been able to connect to people like SNP have at a local level , SNP may be a short term thing unless it has made connections.  Something else to take into account is the idea of independance is easy to sale to most people everybody wants to be independance.   Why has xenophobia message been a success? Answer is quite simple most people have quite a bit of misinformation when it comes to the EU and don't understand the EU.   Speaking to my Dad he could not tell me institutions the EU had and the power they had.  He wants to leave the EU...but can't tell me why or what wrong with the EU.   Labour attitude towards the EU referendum was the right choice. When you talk to most voters EU not even in the top 20 issues on their mind so the strategy was sound.   Would have made no difference when it came to UKIP Labour voters who feel like they are left behind and UKIP listens to them.  Labour would been able to flank Tories on the issue but would been short term impact with no gain.   My view on the European Union needs serious reform and we should be part of the European Union.  European Union can be undemocratic but so can the UK only 25% of people voted for the Tory party but they have the most seats.  House of lords has a major impact on laws of the land but nobody voted for them.  Lost of some control is worth it for influence we gain.  UK was able to become so powerful due to keeping it own influence high this has required us working together with other nations.  British empire was able to keep it own influence by a series of global institutions.  America created it own institutions after WW2 which allowed it influence to spread around the world allowing the nation to become the most powerful in the world.   2 billion people between two nations in the world both are lacking influence but when it time comes they are likely to build their own influence and institutions. UK runs a risk real of being a loser in the new global order when it decides to avoid pooling influence together with like minded nations.   I would like to see European union federal state or federal European union. European commision should be a institution with little power, MEPs and european parliament should have overall control.  Eurozone should have it own set of institutions to overseer the block and everybody else should share the same institutions.  Would like to see laws standardised and trade standards. Institutions across states should have the same powers and work with each other. Refining the current setup so it becomes a trade block with strong institutions and eurozone institutions given more power.  My vision everybody who has a trade deal with the EU gets a seat at the EU trade institution, so Norway gets a say in any changes which impact trade to them.    Anything which the institutions do should be open and when it comes to trade deals that does mean being open at every stage."

But the Scottish referendum clearly demonstrated the negative consequences of Labour being identified with an ‘elite’, ‘establishment’ consensus.   I'm not sure I agree with this sentiment. Labour was tarnished in the Scottish Independence referendum by being seen as ""with the Tories"" while other left wing parties were on the other side. This time, on the ""in"" side will be Labour, the SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and ""some of the Tories"". That's a wholly different situation. To be seen to be spurning a united ""in"" campaign will if anything alienate Labour all over again.  For the record, I'm rabidly pro-European, personally.

As what you might think of as a ""soft Blairite"", he might be an interesting choice.

LabourUK,35kvna,CaptainHayashi,2,Mon May 11 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"There are worse parts of the Conservative Party's history to mimic than Disraelie's One Nation philosophy. It was as close to redistributive as Conservatism has ever gotten, with the principals that the better off had an obligation to use their wealth to improve the lot of the ""other classes"". The whole idea was that we were all part of one society and needed to ensure all parts of society were OK; a reaction against individualism and opposed to what would later be ""free market capitalism"".   Not that I'm saying that it was a good idea, when we already have the traditions of Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism to call upon which do the whole thing better, but if we were going to nick a catch phrase from any part of Tory history, it might as well have been from Disraeli."

LabourUK,35j8p1,LIFTSHIT,10,Sun May 10 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"I joined the party (at 18 in 2010, so I'm now also 23!) because, while on the surface my politics is closer to the Greens and Socialist parties,  I felt as if Labour was the biggest and most fruitful voice for progressive politics.  Also, in 2010 (and again now), the wilderness of just losing an election was the perfect time for it to move away from New Labour and towards the left.  In that sense, it sorta did and sorta didn't with Ed, but I'm happy with the ground gained and still a member five years on.  Labour is a 'broad church' party, in that it attracts a wide range of opinions and tendencies.  As well as being the party of Blair, Brown and Mandelson, we are also the party of Benn, Skinner and Foot.  (Something I found interesting was a 2003 BBC article by the latter on why, after the party moved from the 1983 peak of left-wing Labour to Blairism, he still felt the left should stay in Labour.)  I think now is one of the best times to join, because there is a debate to be had, lots of opinions to fly (do we move back to the centre?  do we keep moving to the left?  do we do so slowly or quickly?  or do we move towards something like Blue Labour, or find a fourth or even fifth way to go?), and most importantly a leadership contest.  I joined in May 2010, and by September I was able to vote (for Ed Miliband!) in a very close and invigorating contest--this year's will be even better because it'll be one member one vote.  Other people will bring their opinions in on this, but what I would say is that Labour is much more than just Chuka Umunna.  It's a broad movement where voices like yours are welcomed.  And I sincerely doubt it's ever too late to join.  (edit: streamlined my wall of text a bit)"
LabourUK,35j8p1,CaptainHayashi,3,Sun May 10 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"I've just joined, people can tell me not to but If Umunna gets elected leader I'm planning on leaving. For me he's the party's greatest threat its faced in a long time."

He owns a £1mil villa in Spain he calls 'The White House.' He once edited his wikipedia page to refer to himself as 'The British Barack Obama.'   He's made statements such as ""We're all capitalists now."" And has the backing of Peter Mandelson. He just seems like a careerist Tory in the wrong party. What the party doesn't need is a return to Blairism."

LabourUK,35j8p1,sosr,1 point,Mon May 11 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"How many times are you going to trot out the same story about the nightclubs?   Context: ""Is it just me or is there a serious lack of cool places to go in central London at the weekends.""  ""Most of the West End haunts seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes, while other places that should know better opt for the cheesy vibe.""  This was in 2006. It's 2015 now.  Yes, he owns a villa, so what? It's white. He's an MP. He calls it the White House, am I missing something really sinister here? Is it because he's successful? Shit, we can't have that in a leader.  There were accusations that he edited his Wikipedia page. The edit came from a computer at the law firm where he was working. He has never admitted doing it. The edit was made in 2007.  ""We are all capitalists now"" is pretty much a statement of fact. We live in a capitalist society based on a capitalist economic system. Anyway, here are some exerpts from another speech he gave, full text here.    Because if we are to build a better capitalism, we must stamp out the fast buck irresponsible practices that precipitated the crash for which our communities are still paying the price.   ...   And therefore Co-operatives must be central to our future, to a better and more productive capitalism.   Anyway, context for the 5 word soundbite which seems to be the basis for plenty of op-ed pieces in the Guardian, this time from the FT:   In Mr Miliband’s line of sight are various industries which he believes are failing consumers: banking, housebuilding, betting companies; energy companies and the pensions industry. The Labour leader said on Friday it was not “anti-business” to promote more competition, as he outlined plans to break up Britain’s largest retail banks.  The message is more subtle than the business-bashing that characterised Labour politics a generation ago. Instead the Labour leader has forged a platform designed to champion consumers, workers and small business – often at the expense of big business.  “The big difference between 1979 and 2013 is that we are all capitalists now,” says Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary and a former corporate lawyer.  “The question is what sort of capitalism do we want? We embrace free markets but we want competitive and free markets and more responsible capitalism.”   So what he was actually saying was a bit less pro-business than some people would have you believe. The man from YouGov saw it as 'banker-bashing'.   He has the backing of Peter Mandelson - well Mandy said Umunna was on the right track, but he didn't back him because he hasn't announced he'll run. There also isn't anything he can do about who decides to back him. If Tony Blair backed Andy Burnham would you then say you aren't voting for him?   What the party doesn't need is a return to Blairism   I'm yet to be given a decent explanation by anyone as to what Blairism means. What does it mean to you?"
LabourUK,35j8p1,rappersdo,2,Mon May 11 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if I think the story is a bit disheartening, it shows a level of arrogance not welcome in the Labour party.   We're supposed to be about helping people, not looking down on them. 9 years ago really isn't that long ago, people weren't ok with being called trash then and they wouldn't be today.   I'll trot it out as much as I want, I think people have a right to know. It's fine for people of any background to lead the party, Tony Benn was a Viscount for fucks sake, but I don't think a 'Jetrosexual' is someone I'd want leading the party.   You've interpreted the ""We're all capitalists now"" speech in that way, but that's not the way I see it, for me he's ignoring the strong social democrat voice in the party and the even quieter socialist voice in the party.   The Labour party is a broad church, so you can't brand everyone capitalists. If we lived under a communist one-party state are we all communists? I just don't trust him, I'd vote for Burnham whoever backed him, Ed Miliband was eventually backed by him and my local MP accepted a £1k donation from Blair.   I'd vote for Burnham because I know he cares, he showed that when dealing with Hillsborough. Can I say the same for Umunna, the man who's aspirations seem to be above helping people?   For me Blairism represents favouring mainly right of centre polices whilst preserving the NHS and offering a better benefits system than Labour.   Miliband is seen as left and he basically endorsed workfare for fucks sake, I really think this goes far beyond left vs right.   People voted Tory because of fear-mongering about the SNP and Labour's inability to defend their record on the economy, left and right also come into it, but that wasn't the chief reason in my view."
LabourUK,35j8p1,sosr,1 point,Mon May 11 10:33:03 2015 UTC,"Well this is better than your response to me a couple of days ago in another thread that 'He's a total wanker.' ;)  Mate you can dig crap up on anyone. Burnham got in trouble with some in 2007 for comments about marriage and tax which were just like Tory policies. He was also linked with Wikipedia edits in 2013. There was also his refusal to set up a public enquiry into the Stafford Hospital deaths.   I'm not saying that people would be ok with being called trash, I'm saying that comments made aged 27 cannot be held against someone forever, and you are quoting him out of context. It doesn't mean that he doesn't want to help people - you would be better looking at his actions as an MP to gauge that.  The 'jetrosexual' tag is something the Daily Mail have used, and I don't agree with it. Again, what is wrong with having a successful person as leader? If Benn was ok, why not Umunna? If you have earned your money, what it inherently wrong with spending it on travel and going out, if that's what you're into?  What does the social democrat and socialist voice of the party think about how public services are paid for? Do they think that it is better for people to be socially and economically mobile, or is it better for us all to be skint?    I'd vote for Burnham whoever backed him   So why does it matter if Mandelson backs Umunna? Personally I think that if Ed Miliband was disliked by some for being a career politician, they'll use the same argument against Andy Burnham.   His aspirations are above helping people? You've got this because he said that some nightclubs had trashy clientele? Please, have a read of some things that Umunna has actually said in speeches or articles he's written.   For me Blairism represents favouring mainly right of centre polices whilst preserving the NHS and offering a better benefits system than Labour.   I don't understand, sorry. Better than Labour, or the Tories?   I really think this goes far beyond left vs right.   I totally 100% agree with you. Left/right, Blairite/Brownite, it conflates and confuses. You can't pigeon-hole like that as you end up with an inaccurate picture.    People voted Tory because of fear-mongering about the SNP and Labour's inability to defend their record on the economy   I agree with you to an extent, but I think there's more to be done."
LabourUK,35j8p1,rappersdo,1 point,Mon May 11 11:38:41 2015 UTC,"I thought you posting the context was you agreeing with me to be honest. I don't see how the context makes it better.   Is 27 now seen as the new 16 or something? He was a fully grown man and should've known better. It doesn't fill me with confidence.   Tony Benn never came out with comments like Umunna though, the guy wanted to abolish the monarchy for fucks sake. There's nothing inherently wrong with an MP being rich or sucessful, but having them openly looking down upon people is worse.  For me it's not so much what Umunna said as where he said it. ASmallWorld is a site that's about differentiating yourself from say 'c-list wanabees.' You're right 27 is a young age to have such a high opinion of yourself, but it shouldn't be taken lightly.   I'm glad we're in agreement, even if only partially on what the argument, or lack thereof, should be over Labour's future. At the end of the day your vote counts just as much as mine over the new leader.  I did mean the tories by the way I typed that out on a phone."

With Jarvis out of the running he's the only one that can secure the northern vote and make sure Labour doesn't drift further from it's base. I fear Umunna would be more Blair than Blair and they'd lose my vote if he's elected leader and I'm sure I'm not alone.
LabourUK,35km26,JTW199,2,Mon May 11 07:24:52 2015 UTC,Same here. I was hoping Jarvis would run but with him out Burnham is my preference. His track record on opposing Tory-LibDem NHS reforms is promising.

I'm sick to death of us pretending we have a presidential political system when we simply do not. I'd like a leader who would be happy to hold regular press conferences attended by the shadow cabinet and who would refer questioners to the relevant shadow minister instead of all the presentation weight being on one person as the ""face of the party"".

LabourUK,35isd7,JTW199,7,Sun May 10 19:59:33 2015 UTC,I guess I have to back Andy Burnham now. I'm just very hesitant on the idea of giving it to Umunna.
LabourUK,35isd7,wryfunctionary,3,Sun May 10 20:31:16 2015 UTC,With good reason. As far as I can tell Umunna is one of the Blairites. He's go the backing of Mandelson for goodness sake.   ...Mandelson!
LabourUK,35isd7,sosr,3,Sun May 10 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"I really think that dismissal as being 'Blairite' or 'Brownite' or even 'Milibandite' is firstly tribal rather than anything valuative, and secondly is massive simplification of how Labour should move forward.  I know that Blair has become a toxic figure, but even if there are some similarities between him and a leadership candidate it is foolish to dismiss that candidate out of hand. Blair also stood for investment in public services and education, and social progression and equality. Those are surely good qualities. I don't suppose anyone is concerned based on anything Umunna has said, that he is likely to be interventionist in foreign policy, or repressive towards civil liberty.   I think the main issue here is that people feel he is too pro-business and too pro-middle class. Personally I don't see why that and fighting for the poor and disenfranchised have to be mutually exclusive."
LabourUK,35isd7,sosr,1 point,Sun May 10 21:26:55 2015 UTC,My main concern when I say 'Blairite' is that he'll be trying to move Labour closer to the Tories on economic policy. Which would be an exceptionally bad move. Labour needs to adopt a policy of targeted economic stimulus.
LabourUK,35isd7,Number-6,1 point,Mon May 11 15:38:26 2015 UTC,Didn't Blair not really have his own economic policy though? He left it to Brown to deal with. I would have thought that high public spending backed up by steady economic growth would be popular among most Labour supporters.

LabourUK,35is3m,famasfilms,3,Sun May 10 19:57:19 2015 UTC,You picked out that part of the Question time programme in your video that stuck in my mind. I was amazed the man could compare buying a pint to national finance!   I'm convinced Labour has to adopt an policy plan of targeted economic stimulus and directly confront Tory economic assertions - i.e a fixation on the national debt and spending deficit - rather than trying to accommodate them and offer 'austerity-lite'. The immediate question is which leader can take the party in this direction.   This time around the Conservatives can't spout their catchphrase 'it was the last government!' - prime time to knock them out of the sky on economic policy I think.   On the whole you've written a very incisive and insightful post here.
LabourUK,35is3m,JTW199,1 point,Sun May 10 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"In a very bittersweet sort of way I look forward to the next five years, because there are so many changes from the previous five in Labour's favour:   Now that the Lib Dems are out of the picture, we see the Tories for what they really are, and can hammer home the unfairness of their programme for government; If the economy recovers, we can claim that it's time to reap the fruits and pull back the throttle on austerity (but we'd need to be careful here, of course, so as not to look like we're 'throwing away the economy again'); If the economy doesn't recover, we can expose it, just like you mentioned, and make the argument that a Labour government at the first two years of a financial crisis can't be all to blame for an economic nightmare lasting ten years afterwards; Finally, we'll have the benefit of hindsight on what went wrong this year.  It'll be tough to rally back, dust ourselves off, and fight the next election on a positive--but that's exactly what we did in the five years from 1992 to 1997.  This election's already looking a lot like 1992..."

Ed to me came across as powerful and full of conviction, but this was after five years of sustained media-and-Tory hammering over his character.  It says it all that, in my family of three, I had myself; someone who had an exceedingly and unwaveringly high opinion of Ed; and someone who all the way to the polling station bemoaned Ed's perceived weakness and uselessness.

They're also going to impose cuts and change the NHS somewhat, and that's going to piss the working class UKIP voters off. Make a show of voting against those cuts and NHS changes, then bring it up at debates when understandably people are upset. Make sure any tory that fucks up is made a show of, Theresa May and Gove are inevitably going to. Make sure anything bad that happens is brought up - make sure the impressionable know the tories are the bad guys.  Meanwhile, try to get the left more engaged. Wrestling seats from the SNP is key, since that'll stop people swinging to tory to try and keep the SNP out of power. The only way to get SNP out is to be less red tory, and more left in Scottish Labour.

They won only 2,900 votes that can't be accounted for from 2010 BNP or UKIP voters.   Considering that in 2010 the seat was a Lab/Con marginal, and the Cons picked it up in 2015, I don't see how you can interpret that as being UKIP taking the seat from Labour. It's as likely as not that those 2,900 UKIP votes would otherwise have been destined for the Conservative party, and UKIP's presence there helped Labour come so close to retaining it.

LabourUK,35fzc7,CaptainHayashi,3,Sun May 10 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"What makes Attlee's story really inspiring is that he achieved all that while the national debt was 238% of GDP (currently 84%) and the Americans were demanding lend-lease repayments - to which they responded with the largest programme of state investment in British history (NHS, education spending, nationalisation, legal aid, infrastructure upgrades, construction... even an atomic bomb). Cameron is using a level of debt far lower than the one Attlee had to deal with to justify massive sweeping spending cuts, appealing to people's anxiety about debt in personal finance (and personal finance is totally different from national finance) to convince them that austerity is economically sound. Labour hasn't challenged it. They've picked up on Tory fixations on lowering the spending deficit and national debt via spending cuts, and in the last election they practically ran the slogan 'we'll cut less' - not an effective one as it turned out.   On personality Attlee was far removed from the flamboyant Churchill (who once summed him up as a 'sheep in sheep's clothing'), small in stature and not one for rhetoric. Don't know how well he would survive in today's media-dominated atmosphere, but I'd like to think well-thought out policies could dismantle soundbites most of the time.    ...Apologies for long, rambling, post...I've been doing that quite a lot since Thursday's result :P."

LabourUK,35fzc7,loskillergypsy,1 point,Sun May 10 10:43:20 2015 UTC,"If the cuts are indeed as deep and as hard as we think they will be, I wonder how far a programme of modernisation and rebuilding could carry us before we need to look elsewhere.

IMO the kind of 'radical' we need doesn't need to take the party further to the right or even to the left but I think that radicalism needs to be reflected in a more principled, liberal stance. I think if Labour capitalise on things like electoral reform, reintroducing the hunting ban (it'll be back by 2020 unfortunately), opening up discussion on drug reform (starting with reassessing the classes of certain drugs) etc. I think Labour would be able to stand out starkly.  I'd also would have liked Labour to defend their economic record but I get the feeling we've missed that boat unfortunately..."

LabourUK,35fzc7,JTW199,2,Mon May 11 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"I would love to see some of the traditionally Green policies introduced with the moderation and realism only Labour could bring.  As you say, the rediscussion of drug reform could be a more palatable alternative to the Green drug policies.  One thing that had me hopeful with our 2015 manifesto was the change to rail franchising, because the Greens and I want to see the railway renationalised (now, unless we get massive amounts of capital to pay off the TOCs, any such process must be gradual).  And electoral reform is something that Labour equivocated on before, so maybe this time we could take the commanding lead.  IMO, the ideal would be to sell these progressive policies in a way that shows hope to the left and pragmatism to the right.  It's something that made me stand up and listen when Ed talked.  I'll always advocate socialist responses to our problems, but don't mistake that for completely blind idealism--we need both sides in a full and principled debate and the result will hopefully be a daring but realistic social democratic platform we can all get behind."
LabourUK,35fzc7,jimboish01,2,Sun May 10 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with railway nationalisation. Everyone and their dog knows the railways are dysfunctional as they are now, I'm fairly sure taking them into public ownership would be a popular move.   Likewise plenty of people are angry over high energy bills, the major energy companies act like a cartel and fix prices together regardless of costs. The '1 year freeze' managed to combine the bad qualities of being half-hearted and inflexible. There are a number of ways to tackle the problem. Outright nationalisation is one, and while it certainly would solve the issue it might be a bit heavy-handed. Tighter regulation on the energy companies may solve the problem more subtly. Or the introduction of a state-run energy company into the market which would set prices at an appropriate level and undercut the private companies when they set their prices an totally unnecessary astronomical levels. Any of these could work, really.   Framing investment in renewable energy within the terms of reducing UK dependency on foreign oil would be a wise move I think, maybe even pointing to the distant future - making the case for Britain being saved from savage wars over dwindling resources. Bit of a far-fetched thought but there you go.   Electoral reform would be an excellent policy to push. Alongside campaign finance reform and recall elections. Regarding who best to lead Labour to this sort of 'daring but realistic social democratic platform'... I think Dan Jarvis or Andy Burnham."
LabourUK,35fzc7,TrickyDickNixonbot,4,Sun May 10 19:53:56 2015 UTC,Really interesting post.

Old Labour is dead, get over it for the love of god. Labour isn't going to be old-style socialist again, it doesn't work and nobody wants it.   This isn't endorsing Blair either, I dont like the guy that much and I think Iraq was Labour's biggest cockup, but stop thinking if we dont immediately adopt a 'renationalise everything, tax-and-spend' platform we've succumbed to the omnipotent evils of Blairism. Theres so much more we can do with this party, and will do with this party, because nobody wants to go back to Old Labour except a small minority.  Using Attlee and Wilson as examples of how 'electable' we can make Labour on socialist platforms just shows how laughably disconnected the people who believe Old Labour is viable really are.

Labour cannot fill the gap in Scotland.   I'm so worried that the small, hard-won ground staked out towards the left by Ed'll be abandoned with a reactionary leap back to Blairism   I think the issue is everyone is going to try and fight tooth and nail for a leap even further left, when we clearly flopped emphasising that platform. The big thing here is Blairism isn't the only alternative to Old Labour, its a completely false dichotomy. Some of what Chuka is proposing (although i'd rather he took over as Shadow Minister of Finance, and Dan Jarvis got leader) is pretty original, especially in regards to bringing back local and municipal control to empower the regions left behind by the city-focused policies of the last few decades. Old Labour is dead, Blairism is dead, move on. We're a party that adapts, we always have been."

Sure, we didn't exactly give Tory voters anything to buy into, but I don't think for a second that that's the be all and end all of why our campaign failed.

I'd kill to see an impartial account of what exactly went wrong in Scotland.   Two big issues, and this is from my own experience with Scottish friends who voted SNP, and the co-opting of the 'Red Tories' cry by the Greens in England. Red Tories does originate with the fact that traditionally, the Scots have felt confident in us to support them, and let them have their say and autonomy. On principle Scots believe we should've stayed out of the independence campaign, let factions in Labour exist for Yes and No, and let them operate autonomously without official leadership endorsement. They felt that when we moved against them, joining the Tories in anti-independence campaigning, we'd let them down, we'd become the party of Westminster big city bankers (whom they associate as wanting to dominate Scotland, more on that in a second), and not the party of the working class we always were to them before that, even in the Blair era.   The backlash of course led to a total rejection of the Westminster consensus, which plays into the passionate anti-austerity rhetoric (which, might I add, the SNP manifesto doesn't really pursue). Now, theres also the newfound association of Labour with an economic model that seems to have overwhelmingly benefited London and the Southwest over everyone else, this is not simply a case of 'right vs. left', but rather regional neglect, this neglect is whats fueling the entire Scottish independence debate to begin with IMO. Expect calls for devolution south of the border to start coming into play soon by the way. Quite simply, we failed to deliver on a program that can direct investment elsewhere, and this doesn't have to be a socialist state-driven agenda either, I can think of a lot of market-driven ways to do this. This is where we fucked up hard. We didn't talk enough about how we're going to empower the neglected regions. Hell, we shamefully let Osborne beat us to talking about a 'Northern Powerhouse'!    As for moving further left being a flop, I just don't see that.

Sure, we didn't exactly give Tory voters anything to buy into, but I don't think for a second that that's the be all and end all of why our campaign failed.   Oh its multiple overlapping reasons. The SNP, Ed as a person, and most importantly the poor rhetoric we used. We spent too much time on trying to coax the old socialist image back, and that scared a lot of people away. The manifesto itself didn't even have to embody this, in fact it only partially did, but we were spending too much time slamming Capitalism and too little time praising good Capitalism. Yeah its silly, but unfortunately thats the kind of thing people want to hear, they dont want to hear rhetoric they associate with strikes, bloated state control, power cuts and rubbish heaping in the streets. They want to hear rhetoric about aspiration and striving outward, and we made no attempt to do that. We played entirely on the class war card, and it flopped. I hate sounding Blairite but the guy is right 100% about the rhetoric we used failing, policy itself is another matter, although I think we may have slipped up in our areas of priority.   Yes, Old Labour and New Labour are dead, so to speak, but people have started picking from their carcasses to find old ideas to give new life.

And the pieces we should never be picking out ever again are the anti-Capitalist, anti-market, mass-renationalisation bits that are completely and solidly dead. The worst bit is this isn't the only path we can take as an alternative to New Labour, as i've repeatedly emphasised around here lately. We can talk about small businesses, startup businesses, friendly bigger businesses, helping the guy that pays well and provides and doesn't try to rig the system to his favour. We need to be trying to create a society where we're all Capitalists, instead of a small handful of people, this is the kind of rhetoric that'll wreck the Tories core support base, and promote a much more egalitarian vision simultaneously. A little bit of this was present, but we weren't focusing on it or expanding enough upon it, we gave it a total backseat to slamming the evil corporates and obsessing over taxation."

Certainly being part of Labour means I can feel part of a real movement for change.  I imagine that even the more 'organic' MPs (Skinner, Tony Benn, etc.) think/thought that parties have a place in politics for the people.

The Conservatives won because they targeted the important swing constituencies.  Remember all that stuff about only needing '11,000 votes in 23 constituencies'?  That level of efficiency was always going to be a gamble, so they spread their net a bit wider, but it worked.  Labour's campaign was based on local activism.

In my area I'm the only active young person for the local ward, though none of the older folks are grumpy in the slightest, they’re a very friendly bunch of people that care about the area.  At the very local level I get a bit of input into the leaflets that get posted through doors, and I volunteer to drop a few off when I have the time, I probably average out at an hour a week plus meetings.   Something you might not enjoy about local politics is that it’s largely concerned with very small issues, things like “Can the local council find money to pay a park keeper?” and stuff like that. It’s not exactly influencing foreign policy but it makes a big difference to people near you and it’s the first way that you’ll get to see how campaigning leads to pressure on politicians, which leads to change.  However, over the whole parliamentary constituency there are a couple of hundred active members, quite a few of them are roughly my age. During Election Day we were out in pairs knocking on the doors of people who said they would consider voting Labour and reminding them to please remember to do it. It since seems to have made no difference whatsoever, but it was a fairly fun way to spend the day, chatting to people about Labour. We have a party/wake coming up to thank people for volunteering and to mourn for the result, which should be fun.  So basically you can choose how much to do, and even pick and choose which parts you find most fun. You’ll meet a bunch of friendly people who are interested in the same stuff as you, and it feels pretty good to spend time drawing attention to local issues."

If you love politics, it's well worth doing. It'll get your email on a bunch of different mailing lists for Young Labour, your local party etc., and you'll start seeing round robin invites to meetings, campaigning days, conferences and all sorts. You can ignore every single one if you like- or you can start picking things that interest you and start getting involved!"

I'd highly recommend joining early, because at 23 I'm finding that, having withdrawn a bit over the years then being recently reinvigorated by Ed Miliband, real life intervenes so much and makes it so difficult to get a foot in the door!  Remember what I forgot--that Labour is for life, not just for elections--, and get involved.

It just seems that every time my CLP holds meetings, I'm either too busy with my PhD studies to get to them, or it's just a bit logistically difficult to do so.  When I was in school, I lived locally, had all of the evenings comfortably off, and had a massive summer holiday where I had literally nothing to stop me from getting involved.  And I already had a friend from school also joining the party at the same time, so we kinda went around as a unit for a while.  That's why I'd strongly recommend OP joins Labour early on.  Having four years of being able to come to meetings without worrying about time pressures is a good head start on things.  But I'm not writing off everyone over 18, of course.  I suppose it depends on where/how often your CLP meets, and what your job situation is!  Part of my problem is that I still feel more attached to my local CLP (Harrogate and Knaresborough) than the university one (York/York Outer).  I imagine it gets a lot easier in areas where Labour are just slightly more competitive (so meetings aren't as rare as once every two months), but where the CLP are still small and locally-minded enough to bend over backwards to welcome new members (like H&K).  York is a much more well-oiled political machine and to be honest it puts me off a bit!  Can anyone in the 'larger' CLPs chip in with perspective?"

Likewise any issues Labour had in Wales. In England Labour argued themselves into a corner, by fixating on reducing the national debt and spending deficit they were in no position to criticism Tory cuts. 'We'll cut less' is no rallying cry. If they'd offered an actual alternative to the Conservative economic stupidity, as in a coherent plan of targeted economic stimulus, I think things would've been different.   For all this let's not complain too much. Labour can shift its ideological stance far easier in opposition than it could in government. We're stuck with the situation as it is now so we might as well make the best of it. The red Tories like Ed Balls have been nailed, Miliband and Murphy are out too. If Neil Findlay can lead Scottish Labour and Andy Burnham takes charge of the national leadership, I think that would produce promising results.   To end on a positive note, that Tory majority is wafer thin. And Labour's seen worse before. In 1931 Labour collapsed from over 200 seats to under 50, by 1945 there was a Labour landslide under an unashamedly Keynesian manifesto. So chin up, and let's go forward ;-)."

LabourUK,35brf6,JTW199,2,Sat May 9 08:27:23 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. This was the Labour left wing's one chance to prove that the centre had moved to the left after the financial crisis and that Labour could win an election by moving to the left rather than occupying the centre ground. And it has completely tanked. You talk about the ""Conservative economic stupidity"" but the hard reality is a hell of a lot of people voted for the Tories on the basis of the economy. You talk about ""red Tories"" like Ed Balls being nailed but the fact is Ed Balls is out because people thought his vision for the economy was too socialist and locals decided they'd prefer to have a Tory running the constituency. If Labour supporters do not wake up and realise that moving further to the left will make it even more unelectable then we will be condemned to the political wilderness for a generation."
LabourUK,35brf6,shelly167,2,Fri May 8 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"People voted for the Tories because Labour tried to out-argue them in their own argument, simply accepting Conservative ideological stance that the spending deficit and national debt need to go down via spending cuts. If Labour had highlighted the obvious flaws in this argument (5 years of austerity and national debt bigger than in 2010, to name but one) and offered an actual alternative of economic stimulus spending then they would have convinced more people over to their side, I think. People's opinions can be changed, you know. Labour shouldn't fold up like a deck-chair to try and accommodate the economic consensus espoused by the Tories and the Murdoch press when it's so obviously flawed.   The manifesto for this election was not left-wing, bar some odd pieces of half-hearted socialist window-dressing, some of which were even roundaboat austerity (defence spending cuts are as bad as any other spending cuts).

Can you see any of those labour candidates as prime minister? Not really. I don't think labour can win in 2020 so there may be a decade or more in the wilderness. In that time the Tories will gradually destroy the poor and squeeze the middle in this country. That will leave a space for a centre left labour, however by then will it be too late? A decade of Thatcherism arguably destroyed much of the social values of the country. More Tory will probably finish the job, destroying councils, outsourcing to private companies and privatising the NHS. What can labour do? Nothing I don't think. Maybe some kind of social movement might work but Thatcher smashed the unions and I'm sure the Tories could beat down any resistance or use the media to demonise it"

Labour can win 2020 without Scottish seats. If you look at Blair's victories, he still won even if you take away the Scottish seats Labour had. However, to win without the safe Socialist Scottish seats in 2020, Labour needs to go after marginals in the Midlands, Wales and the north that it failed to take from the Tories. But it also needs to go even further, snatching marginals that Tories have taken from the Lib Dems this time around and challenging cosmetic Tory seats in ""middle England"". And yes that includes constituencies in southern England, out of the traditional Labour comfort zone. The reemergence of something resembling New Labour in the event of a defeat was merely a possibility for a Labour party with left wing Scottish seats. Without them it is an inevitability. As well as abandoning the fallacy that England's centre ground somehow moved to the left after the financial crisis, Labour members must vote with their heads and choose the best leader this time around. It is certainly not Andy Burnham in my view. He strikes me as too close to the unions and a ""core Labour voter"" man who won't galvanise voters outside of Labour's comfort zone. I am not convinced Andy Burnham has the stomach to wrench Labour to the centre ground in the way the next leader needs to do to have a hope in hell of winning. My instinct is that Chuka is the best hope Labour has for winning 2020."

We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next parliament. This manifesto sets out that we will not compromise on this commitment.   I think that's the bit. Page 2 of the manifesto where they swallow in it's entirety the Conservative line that the first priority of government is not he welfare of the citizenry, but the national debt.   Labour have abandoned the left.   This is why they have been so thoroughly spanked by the SNP in Scotland. Combined with the fact nobody wanted Ed to be Prime Minister (sorry Milifans, he's just not inspiring in any way at all) lowered the Labour vote.

The blame for this firmly lies in an Old Labour resurrection attempt, and yeah thats probably a legitimate backlash to New Labour, but the final point is we need to start thinking a totally different way and stop plunging ourselves into this Capitalism vs. Socialism paradigm, and putting ourselves on one end or the other."

It's a tricky balance, and I thought Ed's pragmatic socialism would have been a step forwards if it had been delivered in a more timely and compelling narrative.  Having said that, I don't like Blairite populism and think that bouncing straight back to it would be a horrifically reactionary move that cuts off Labour's nose to spite its face.

As for what direction the party needs to go in obvious needs to be more local and remember people don't always make rational choices.  Was speaking to local Labour leader councilor, who is the leader of the town council both agreed on that.

It is a long standing criticism (and by ""long standing"", we're talking half a century) that Labour puts far too much emphasis on central office and the Parliamentary Party, while the Constituency Parties are way too small, granular and uninfluential- there's no reasonably sized structure in between. Something you can see echoed in both the problems in Scotland (which, ironically, is one of the only parts of the country with a decent mid-tier structure) and in criticism of e.g. Blair's detachment from the grassroots.  I would kill for an equivalent of Scottish Labour (as a structural entity) in my region, and if the whole party were structured that way (making Scottish Labour the norm, not the exception) you might see a lot less condescending ""Branch Office"" treatment coming from the top.  All that said, I still can't really bring myself to criticise Miliband too hard for all this, as I actually did agree with the direction he was taking the party, policy wise. It's just a shame that the grassroots structures were as such that we couldn't bring it to fruition."

It is common to find groups like Socialist Worker, charities and other political groups putting up stalls outside the tube here. Why do Labour only come out at election time?  I think Labour's message got muscled out years ago, particularly on fiscal policy, a few month's campaigning wasn't enough. The Tories have more media support (Murdock, Telegraph, Mail etc) and more money. This cemented view-points such as blaming Labour for the global financial crises, blaming the poor for our woes etc. What if Labour used its larger grass roots support throughout the cycle? It could also give a way out of sound bite politics and enable a real debate."

I do worry however that a defeat on this scale may put us in the same position that the Tories were in in 1997, where any leader walking into the job would have next to no chance of winning an election, and would simply be there to stop the party from consuming itself."

Also, I think it's pretty clear that we have been behind on economic credibility for a long time. As a party we did little to challenge the idea that the financial crash and following recession were somehow our fault.  Whilst the Iraq was was unpopular, and it may explain part of our problems in Scotland, we were still able to win a majority after the war with a leader who understood that for Labour to gain power, we need to appeal to people who don't vote Labour.

If you speak to swing voters they just haven't gotten over the Blair/Brown years yet and aren't ready to put Labour back in.  In some ways a Conservative majority could be good for us because people have forgotten what utter scumbags they are when they have a free reign. Give them these five years of being free to cut everything, shit all over your freedoms and get back to attacking the working class without the Lib Dems holding them back and people might be clamouring for Labour again.

LabourUK,3592h8,JTW199,2,Fri May 8 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"The problem in England and Wales is that Labour was campaigning on the basis of accepting Tory economic assertions...i.e. that the spending deficit and the national debt need to be reduced at all costs.   This argument could have been very easily dismantled if Labour actually confronted it. A simple look at history shows you all you need to know. The years of 1945-79 when Britain operated under the consensus of social democracy and promoting a mixed economy were some of the most prosperous in this nation's history, especially concerning the adverse conditions we had to build it all from (devastation following WW2/Americans tugging at us for lend-lease repayment etc) . Since 1979 we've seen a sprawling, over sized, critically under regulated volatile financial sector dominating the British economy, a system implemented by Thatcher and continued by New Labour (partially alleviated by Gordon Brown) and now alive and kicking under Cameron's Tories.   You can't cut your way to stable significant growth. Labour should offer nationalisation of the Railways, tighter regulation on the energy companies (1 year energy freeze was exceptionally half-hearted), and considerable investment in upgrading infrastructure and construction. All of which gets people employed, gets the economy moving, boosts GDP. Other areas of spending (like defence) should stay as they are, or increase (UK armed forces equipment is largely domestically sourced...more defence spending=more contracts for UK companies) all of which could be funded by government borrowing at effectively negative interest rates and higher taxes.   Apologies for rambling tone of post... trying to shove a lot of information across at once.  ...Also with Murphy gone as well I hope Neil Findlay takes charge of Scottish Labour. If Andy Burnham takes the national party leadership we might see some considerable policy change."

Some people are saying we lost because we didn't go left enough but I couldn't disagree more.  Even if you added up all the SNP and Green Votes to ours (assuming we wouldn't alienate loads of Labour voters by going further left, which we obviously would) we'd still have lost the election.  Not to mention Scottish people voted SNP mostly because they stand for an independent Scotland, it wouldn't matter how left we'd gone in Scotland because 45% of them want to leave the union and unless we offered that they're voting SNP."

On the other hand, we don't seem to be losing much or any seats to the Tories in England (just not winning enough off them), and are picking up some Lib Dem seats (with others swinging to Cons).   What would have happened if we had tacked to the Blairite right? Would we have won many more Tory or Lib Dem seats, or failed to win the ones we did?

LabourUK,351nq7,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Wed May 6 11:01:13 2015 UTC,"Yes! There's the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, for one thing."
LabourUK,351nq7,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Wed May 6 14:09:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm going to break rank here. Sorry, everyone.  I don't believe in tactical voting. You should always vote for the party which best aligns with your beliefs for (at least) two reasons:   The long-term: Your vote doesn't only count at this election: It points the way to the future. If Labour keep losing votes to the Greens, for example, they'll move in the Green's direction. FPTP is a broken system. Voting for the party you believe in -- rather than abstaining or voting tactically -- shows up exactly how broken it is and increases the pressure to fix it.   As a minor, third, reason, it's not your fault if the 'good' party doesn't get elected: It's their fault for not doing enough to win your vote.  Now, let me tell you why you should vote Labour anyway.  The Greens are not and cannot be a credible political party because they lack a proper social base: They're an environmental pressure group that runs for Parliament. Labour, by contrast, is not a set of vaguely 'Labourish' policies: They're the political arm of an actual movement, rooted in the real experiences of the people they represent. This is the reason that Labour has always (not just since Blair -- ask Miliband's dad) disappointed people looking to implement 'real socialism': We don't care about intellectual purity; we care about working people. We cock up, sometimes, because we're human, but we're always aiming for the common good.  That's why the fact that Labour is a part of the political establishment is a strength, not a weakness. Yes, it means compromise, and even, sometimes, corruption. But it also means that the voice of working people is part of the establishment. That's important. Before Labour, our voice was not part of the establishment, it was outside it, like the Greens are (arguably) now. We built the NHS by being part of the establishment; we introduced a minimum wage by being part of the establishment; we'll freeze energy prices by being part of the establishment.  The alternative to being part of the establishment is standing outside the establishment and shouting at it. To me, that isn't enough.  Some of what you describe as your politics requires a cultural shift, rather than a political one (a government can judge itself on something other than GDP growth, but if everyone else is looking at GDP, it won't get anywhere!). There's no clear way of achieving a cultural shift. However, Labour right now are saying that GDP growth isn't enough, that we need good jobs and better pay, too. Electing a party arguing for that might be part of that shift.  Now, regarding climate change: You might know Miliband was Climate Change Secretary. He helped get the Copenhagen agreement through the UN, which was a big deal. Yes, Copenhagen didn't go far enough, but if it hadn't been passed at all, I think we can agree that would've been worse. Our leader has a good track record on climate change, and I think that's a reason to believe he'll maintain that record once he's in power.  One of the disadvantages of being an establishment party is that you have to campaign on the issues that people care about, not on niche interests. While I agree with you that climate change is the biggest issue facing the world -- and many in the party, including Ed, do too -- if people don't raise it as a big issue, the way they do with the NHS and immigration, talking about it a lot is crazy. We'd be seen as ignoring the things people actually care about and voters would turn away as a result. It's not pretty, but it's politics.  Regarding the problem of corruption of various kinds in politicians: This is a problem, and we should do more to stop MPs sitting on boards and that kind of thing (Labour will ban second jobs for MPs, which will help achieve this). I have two things to say in response to your point regarding what MPs do after they retire, though. First, there's absolutely no reason to think Green MPs wouldn't do the exact same thing. None. Second, what are MPs supposed to do when they leave the Commons? Write their memoirs and do nothing for years? Become bus drivers? No, they're going to do something commensurate with their level of experience: They're going to end up running things, and some of them will run businesses. I think we could help deal with the 'special interest' problem by making them take 'gardening leave' -- six months or so after they leave the Commons where they can't take another job, maybe longer for ministers. But whatever. Again, this is a problem that all political parties will have, however pure their intentions.  Labour members' voices are heard, yes, and the more of us there are, the more they'll listen. We can change our party, and the world. The mobility of capital and finance doesn't stop us building good schools and hospitals, or even having a state industrial policy (China has one!). You shouldn't expect to join a party and have everyone immediately listen to you but we do get things done by pressing on the issues we care about. Labour will never implement every policy its members want and nor will any party. Government's tricky. But Labour can be a good party, a good government, that's responsive to the needs of its members and the people. And that's why you should join us, because with every new member, we get a new voice pulling us in the right direction."
LabourUK,351nq7,canard_glasgow,2,Wed May 6 14:40:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comprehensive reply. You've definitely given me food for thought!
LabourUK,351nq7,HuhDude,2,Wed May 6 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"FPTP is a bastard but that is the electoral system we have to work with. If your seat is a Lab/Con swing then at least your vote has the ability to move things one direction or another. You can vote Lab, vote Con or abstain (effectively what a vote for a no hoper is). Labour aren't a bastion of progressive policies, but they are better than the Conservatives and they at least try to look out for the disadvantaged in society."
LabourUK,351nq7,can_triforce,2,Wed May 6 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you were in a safe seat for Lab or Con I would strongly recommend you vote Green - no other major party is capable of instituting the changes in society I get the sense you're after.  In practice though, you don't have that choice. You have been thoroughly disenfranchised by the FPTP system even though you live in a marginal. I would therefore suggest you vote Labour tomorrow. They have lost their way, and they may well be beyond redemption, but I choose to believe they can't be any worse than the Tories. Yet."
LabourUK,351nq7,can_triforce,2,Wed May 6 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"Better to vote Labour, and end up with PR in the event of a deal with any of the smaller parties, than vote for the Greens and end up with another Tory in parliament, who would certainly resist PR. It's a shame that it's come to this, but FPTP is FPTP; I'd suggest vote swapping, so that there isn't one less vote for a PR party, but I doubt those schemes are legitimate."
LabourUK,351nq7,Evsie,3,Wed May 6 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"yeah I did a vote swap thing this morning so I will be voting Labour tomorrow. Shame I have to resort to that but, like you say, FPTP."
LabourUK,351nq7,autowikibot,2,Wed May 6 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a vote swap is a decent solution. Every extra 0.1% of the population that votes for a pro-PR party is vital."
LabourUK,351o8m,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed May 6 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"My prediction- I think the headline figures in Scotland will still be a massacre, but tactical voting and incumbency will mean that we do better in seats terms than some of the worst doomsday scenarios. Not necessarily by a country mile, but even a few extra seats could make all the difference. I'm more confident than you about England- we're currently polling neck-and-neck there, and even if the Tories do get a much vaunted late boost, I can't see it being more than the odd percentage point. Performance in key marginals will be all that really matters. Can't see Wales going other than how it's predicted. On the whole, I'm deeply sceptical of any Shy Tory nonsense; if the Tories do do better it will be because of incumbency, not timidity. If anything, following Labour's press drubbing, it will be us and the Lib Dems with any Shy factor.  What am I doing? Not a lot, really! I've got work until the evening, and my wife will have the car until even later so I won't be able to play taximan. Might be able to join the GOTV phone bank activities if time is good to me.  Me and my wife have both got Friday off, so can stay up watching the results to the early hours. Hoping to stay up at least to 5:00 am when South Thanet reports; that should also have given a chance for a good smattering of other marginals to come out and start to show the big picture. Other ""ones to watch"" are of course Clegg and Murphy."
LabourUK,351o8m,Patch86UK,2,Wed May 6 11:52:52 2015 UTC,"I admire your optimism!  I reckon Clegg's safe, unfortunately, due to tactical voting."
LabourUK,351o8m,Patch86UK,2,Wed May 6 11:57:20 2015 UTC,"I reckon Clegg's safe, unfortunately, due to tactical voting.   While you're probably right, and you probably saw that ICM constituency poll a few days ago that put him ahead, I can cheer you up a little bit about that. The ICM poll (which put him 7 pts ahead) only had a sample size of 500- meaning a margin of error of 6 pts. The previous Ashcroft poll (which had Labour ahead by 1 pt) had a 1000+ sample, so a standard 3 pt margin of error. In other words, it's entirely possible that there was no swing at all, or only a small swing. That's the problem with infrequently polled demographics like individual constituencies- no big picture. The other thing to remember is that Tory tactical voters are less likely to turn out for their second choice than their first choice- something which isn't reflected in the methodologies.  Probably all nothing, but it still make it exciting!"
LabourUK,351o8m,seandsmyth,2,Wed May 6 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that about the samples sizes! Food for thought, certainly. Just goes to show that there's still everything to fight for, there as elsewhere."

Cameron may hang on until the Commons reconvenes, and I definitely agree we should spend the entire time out in the streets protesting if he does so. But he will not survive a no confidence vote, Miliband will become PM, and there will be nothing at all that the Tories or the press can do about it.

He'll be dogged at every step by the media, lambasted for being ineffectual and illegitimate. If he works with others then they'll shout him down as being compromised.   It would be an utterly toxic tactic but I think Owen Jones is right in that this is what the press and the Conservatives are setting up for."

Either way, you're not wrong about voter registration. But maybe this'll have more impact coming this close to polling day?"

Just to be clear, this comes on the back of Sturgeon failing to censure a candidate for anonymously attacking people on Twitter, and senior SNP people suggesting that it's okay to intimidate politicians (specifically, Margaret Curran). There was also the anonymous death threat to a Labour candidate, although obviously we don't know if they were pro-SNP. It doesn't exactly seem unlikely, however.  With Rupa Huq being manhandled by some Tory and the Tory protesters punching Ed a few weeks ago, Labour are definitely having a bit of a rough time out on the streets but I think it may actually ultimately work in our favour, like the various verbal and written attacks levelled at Ed's personality and/or kitchenette.  EDIT: Murph's response. Also drew my attention to this tweet from LabourList's Conor Pope, with more evidence of SNP intimidation. Honestly, filming people?

A ""now we know who you are and will remember it"" sort of vibe. An implied threat.   Nationalism is an ugly thing. It's remarkable that even something as non-radical and centrist as the SNP (who are arguably closer to the centre than Labour are on many points) still attracts that same dangerous, violent passion as nationalist movements always do."

LabourUK,34puok,brucejoel99,3,Mon May 4 11:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the sarcasm in my post.  Genuinely, though, I think the 30% undecideds are unlikely to be SNP voters. They obviously won't all go Labour's way (hence the sarcasm). However, I think a big chunk of them are probably 'undecided' because they're unionists who are weighing up whether to vote for the party they actually like or whether to vote tactically against the SNP.  If I'm right, we could see a big chunk of people going Labour's way because they're best-positioned to stop the SNP. The same effect might save Charles Kennedy and Danny Alexander, and perhaps even the one Scottish Tory MP.  The SNP vote probably won't get any lower but if the Labour vote goes higher it could save us a few marginals.  I agree that I'm clutching at straws."
LabourUK,34puok,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon May 4 11:23:47 2015 UTC,"And uniform swing really isn't what it's all about in our twisted, stupid FPTP system. All that matters is what happens in each constituency.  I saw a projection in the Indy the other day (via /r/BritishPolitics I think) that had Labour behind the Tories nationally by only 9 seats, and with the SNP taking all but 10 seats in Scotland. That means Labour hanging on to a relatively tiny number of extra seats in Scotland could be the difference between Labour and the Tories being the largest party. Just a few instances of tactical voting defying the national swing would be enough to change the game entirely."
LabourUK,34puok,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Mon May 4 14:10:08 2015 UTC,"Indeed. There was a LabourList article suggesting the world had gone topsy-turvy in Scotland: Labour are nowhere in our former strongholds but hearing lots of good things in our former weak spots. Scotland is an unknown quantity, essentially.  UK pollsters have long adjusted for known anomalies in our voting patterns, like shy Tories and low turnout in Labour-held seats, but they don't know what -- if any -- kinds of anomalies might be thrown up by the rise of the SNP, Ukip and so on. So a lot of polls could be way off. The fact that the Scottish polls show an SNP lead of anything from 18-points to 34-points suggests that, while the SNP are pretty clearly enormously ahead, something's gone wrong in someone's methodology. We won't know what until May 8th. The Guardian was suggesting that even the exit polls will be 'wrong' because of the rise of newer parties, even in Scotland.  Who the fuck knows, though?"

LabourUK,34fxax,SirJakek,5,Thu Apr 30 20:31:39 2015 UTC,More like a gamble. The only way (from current polls) this election can go (if there's no big mess ups) is Labour in power with coalitions/confidence votes from SNP/Lib/Green/Others. It could be a majority or close if it wasn't for all the labour turned SNP voters in Scotland. Hes betting a lot of those who vote SNP do it because they think they will the get best of both worlds (SNP with Labour) and that by denying the SNP coalition a lot of those voters will switch to labour in the last few days to try and swing as many extra seats as possible.
LabourUK,34fxax,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Thu Apr 30 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"There's no stopping the SNP with only 7 days to go. Ruling out a coalition made sense, but to rule out any deal whatsoever? He'll either look like a hypocrite once he does make a deal with them to form a minority government, or will never be forgiven if, heaven forbid, he allows the Tories to return to power."
LabourUK,34fxax,Patch86UK,5,Thu Apr 30 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to do any deals. He can just put the Queen's Speech out there and say, 'There it is. Vote for it, or put the Tories in power. Your call.' No deal on the table.  EDIT: Oh, approximately 30% of Scotland is still undecided, which is huge, and 30% of Lib Dems and Cons say they'd vote tactically to keep out SNP, and Lib Dems say they're generally more likely to change their minds. That's quite a lot of people who might jump Labour's way. SNP are most certain of all about their vote: We're not going to win them back in seven days, so we have to win others."
LabourUK,34fxax,AnxiousMo-Fo,3,Thu Apr 30 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"There is another option.  Option 1: Formal coalition, like the Con/Lib one. Both Labour and SNP ruled that out to yonks ago.  Option 2: Confidence and supply or some similar agreement, whereby SNP agree to support the confidence motions and budgets, but everything else is case by case. We can assume that's out too.  Option 3: Labour just put a Queen's Speech and Budget before parliament and see who bites- no concessions, no deals, just a regular Labour bill. If SNP support it, they do so without any prompting or promises of return of favours. That's not ruled out.  And does anyone think that the SNP (whose manifesto so closely mimics Labour's) would vote down a Queen's Speech and put the Tories back in power just out of spite? I don't buy it. And I think that that fact is why the SNP are a lot less powerful in this landscape than they might be. By guaranteeing that they will never back the Tories and will always block them from power, they've given away their only real bargaining power at Westminster."

It's an announcement of rent controls (something that we haven't had in this country in 35 years- a true pre-Thatcherite policy), and the reaction is ""why can't it be more""? It's already a risky proposition in terms of media and voter reaction- locking thousands of landlords into multi year rent cuts would be damned near revolutionary.  Personally, I like it. 3 year tenancies- as someone who (like most people) lived under a rolling month-by-month single year tenancy, I'd have killed for that. Rent rises capped to inflation (so that'd be ""0%"" this year)- considering that rent inflation has been above CPI pretty much for a decade now, that's huge in money terms. And tax penalties for landlords who let their houses fall below liveable standards (currently there are no consequences for this, hence all the delightful slum-lords in London and elsewhere)- I'm pleased with that too."

I'm perfectly happy with Big State Spending. But the reason I say that is because I believe the state has a key role to play in ensuring society works properly. It isn't an aim unto itself. As an amateur Keynesian, I'm fully behind the concept that while spending should be higher during the depths of a crash, it needs to drop back again in the good times. Promising an unlimited supply of magic money and assuming the wheels won't fall off of society because of it is not ""good"" public spending- it doesn't help people, although I bet it does win votes."

Wealth distribution is pretty socialist no, and pretty necessary given how much inequality has risen under successive governments. Perhaps if Labour believed that the workers should be entitled to a fair share of the profit they create, then they'd have a point. But if you believe the workers should be working for the benefit of the owners, and the role of the state is not to redistribute the wealth but support this system where the capitalist owners extracts profits from the workers and gives nothing back in return, in what way can this be described as socialist?"

If this election were following the normal Lab v Con pattern, at this point we would be polling enough for a comfortable victory. The Labour campaign has so far been a pretty unmitigated success, with approval on all the measures going in the right directions, combined with a Tory campaign which has just been inexplicably poor.  There's a fly in the ointment, though, in the form of Scotland. Following the recent rise of the nationalist party following the independence referendum, Labour look set to lose as many as 40 seats or more from north of the boarder. This means that despite the fact that we're polling better than the Tories in England and Wales, we might still come out with less seats now. It's not a total problem, as the SNP have categorically stated that they will not prop up the Tories and will only deal with Labour, so we should still be able to pull together a government after the dust has settled. The Tories are using ""vote Labour, get SNP"" scare tactics in England and Wales to the full extent now, though.  Still, it's still looking good. The Tories and their natural allies have pretty much no way of cobbling together more seats than Labour+SNP without a major shift on the polls, so it's difficult to see any way they can win it in their wildest fantasises. Tellingly, even the bookies are favouring Miliband for PM now."

The UK establishment desperately don't want Labour to win, which for me is a damn good reason to vote Labour.  Unfortunately, Labour aren't going to 'win' in the sense that was common a few years ago because we're not going to win a Commons majority. There's even a possibility we will lose (i.e., come second in) the popular vote, not get as many Commons seats as the Conservatives and still end up as the only party that can form a government due the arithmetic of seats in the Commons -- we have more allies than the Conservatives.  Thus, questions will be raised about the legitimacy of such a government and we'll have an enormous fight on our hands for every single thing we try to do over the next five years."

LabourUK,33fp2v,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Apr 22 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"Only the Commons. We don't currently have elections to the House of Lords, so there's no way of 'winning' a majority there!"

Sometimes -- and this may be one of them -- the party with the most seats doesn't have enough allies in the other parties to win a majority.   When that happens, someone else (i.e., Ed Miliband, the Labour leader) can try to pull together a majority vote and become PM. That may happen this time: The people will elect a left-leaning parliament, with the result that Labour is in the best position to form a majority even if they don't have the highest number of seats.  So it's not actually a question of largest party, ultimately. The situation I'm describing has actually happened before, so there's precedent."

It's bad enough that the Co-op Group are being stingy with their support during this election campaign; if they disassociate from Labour and we lose that funding, it's going to make it even harder for us to win the next one.

""Some categories have gone down, but violent crime has gone up"" ""Yes, but what's happened to crime?"". Was that not a pretty straightforward answer? Just because you want Miliband to say the exact words ""It's gone down, how amazing!"" doesn't mean that he's going to.  Found a bit of a stride when talking about inequality/living standards though.

LabourUK,332580,ProfessorZ00M,5,Sat Apr 18 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"For me, there are two (almost exclusive) answers to this question, depending on my mood.  Firstly, let's say I'm a big lefty who wants all sorts of lefty things to be implemented. The likes of the Greens have a manifesto promising every lefty policy you could dream of. But is it realistic? I want good social democratic / democratic socialist policies implemented, but not at the expense of having a working country. It's easy for the Greens/etc. to offer the moon on a stick if they never have to worry about implementing them. I have faith that Labour can deliver what they promise, and promise only what they think they can deliver. Labour promise that the minimum wage will rise to £8 in 4 years. Do I wish it could be more? £10? £15? Sure. But I know that Labour will deliver it and the country can afford it, while for other parties it is an empty promise to win my vote.  Secondly- maybe I'm just not as left wing as some of these parties. Labour might genuinely be the party for me. I consider myself in solidly democratic socialist territory, and I felt that Blair's New Labour was too right wing for me. But Miliband's Labour of today ticks an awful lot of my boxes. Take the rail thing- Labour's manifesto promises to set up a public sector rail operator which will compete for rail franchises, winning them off private operators wherever they can offer a better deal. To me, this is a perfect policy- nationalisation wherever it makes sense to do so, privatisation wherever it is genuinely able to do better. Parties offering total renationalisation NOW are basically saying ""let's do it even if it doesn't make sense"". That just doesn't appeal to me. Apply that logic to any policy area where Labour are ""left"", but others are more so, and you get where I'm coming from.  So there you go, that's my reasons."
LabourUK,332580,Patch86UK,3,Sat Apr 18 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. The Greens have some good policies, but they're too idealistic/extreme in the sense that there's no chance of the public accepting such a huge change overnight. I see Labour as a slowly slowly step towards that, which combines leftwing policies, with short/medium term pragmatism. And they're well established, increasing the believability factor."

Instead the Blairites would come crawling out to complain about a supposed anti business attitude and Labour would shift back to the centre.

Im really glad Labour isn't hopping on the left-wing anti-globalisation bandwagon (and Chuka is embodying our resistance to that) and that we have people who understand how it ticks, and how we can make it work best for us as a country. Whats ultimately pretty awesome though is the vision of a high-wage, skilled-jobs economy (similar to Germany, which I much admire) thats competitive on the global market, one that our current platform seems to really back. I think if Ed does get elected, we'll almost certainly see a new orientation towards promoting manufacturing and exports in Britain, but in a way that wont require protectionism but will instead open us up to more and further-flung free trade deals.

I would have liked to see some of these points fleshed out a little more than we've already had.  I'd have also liked some more of what you might call ""natural nationalisation"" in there. The sole example (and not very hyped up) in the manifesto is the policy around setting up a public sector rail operator to bid in franchising contests. I like this policy, and it makes a lot of ideological sense (essentially, nationalise rail franchises wherever it makes financial sense to do so), but I'd have loved to have seen more examples of things like this.

In fact going as far back as Thatcher they opposed a lot of the privatisation, as their plans were more cooperatisation oriented supporting employee-buyouts of state assets or break up into hundreds of local small businesses.   I do think Labour should shoot to co-opt a Distributist/Market Socialist approach before the Tories realise Neoliberalism is a disaster and shift to that wing instead, they'd also combine the good aspects with their parties negative aspects, I.E. dismantling of the welfare state and public investment, so we have to get there first.

It seems like a good model overall, though.  I actually get my gas and electricity through The Co-operative Energy, so if you'd like to see co-operatively owned energy, that's the place to start!  Re: the cuts, the thing that annoys me is that five years ago, everyone on the left - me included - was invoking Keynes and saying you shouldn't cut during a recession, you should invest: If you cut, you'll kill the recovery. I feel history has proved us right on that one. But now, most of the left has completely forgotten Keynes and is insisting that we keep throwing money around and borrowing now that growth, however anaemic, has returned. Keynes would categorically not support that. He'd be arguing that now is the time to pay down government debts and allow the private sector to invest.  Obviously I don't mind disagreement, but the intellectual inconsistency of using one set of arguments when they suit you then throwing them away once they don't is infuriating. The SNP are making absolute hay out of all the Labour activists/voters who are grumbling about austerity, so it has political consequences, too.  Anyway, that's why I agree with you and Chuka!

LabourUK,32la95,AlbertDock,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Georgism:       Georgism (also known as geoism and geonomics) is an economic philosophy holding that the economic value derived from natural resources and natural opportunities should belong equally to all residents of a community, but that people own the value they create.    The Georgist paradigm offers solutions to social and ecological problems, relying on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.    Georgism is concerned with the just distribution of economic rent caused by natural monopolies, pollution, and the control of commons, including title over natural resources and other contrived privileges (e.g., intellectual property). Any natural resource, which is inherently limited in supply, can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of 'land monopoly' involves the extraction of common ground rent from the value of urban and agricultural locations.  Georgists argue that taxing economic rent derived from land and natural resources is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy tool is a fee assessed on location value, often referred to as a land value tax (LVT). Georgists argue that socially captured rents can reduce or eliminate existing taxes on labor and investment that are unfair or inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue collected from economic rent back to the people through a basic income or citizen's dividend. Economists since Adam Smith have observed that, unlike other taxes, a land value tax would not cause any economic inefficiency and even stimulates economic activity.  A land value tax is often said to have progressive tax effects, in that it is paid primarily by the wealthy without being passed on to tenants.   Land value capture would reduce economic inequality, increase wages, remove incentives to misuse real estate, and reduce the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles.   The philosophical basis of Georgism dates back to several early proponents such as John Locke  and Baruch Spinoza,  but the concept of gaining public revenues from natural resource privileges was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer Henry George and his first book, *Progress and Poverty. *  Georgist ideas were popular and influential in the earlier part of the 20th century.  Political parties, institutions and communities were founded based on Georgist principles during that time. Early followers of George's philosophy called themselves Single Taxers, associated with the idea raising public revenue exclusively from land and privileges, but the term is considered a misnomer because Georgists do not consider their proposals to be true taxes and they usually support multiple funding mechanisms. In classical and Georgist economics, the term 'land' is defined as all locations, natural opportunities, resources, physical forces, and government privileges over economic domains, which is closely related to the concept of commons.  Georgism was coined later, and some prefer the term geoism or geonomics to distinguish their beliefs from those of Henry George.  instead.

There's apparently only five 'new' policies in there, according to the Guardian:   Raising the minimum wage  Today, we are setting out the detail of that pledge: we will give the Low Pay Commission the clear task of raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by October 2019 – accelerating increases and guaranteeing the NMW increases by at least twice as much as it has under the Tories.  It will mean someone working full time on the National Minimum Wage being £800 a year better off compared to continuing with the rate of rise under the Tories.  Rail fare freeze  Instead of an uncosted Tory plan they have no idea how they will pay for, Labour will deliver a fully funded rail fares freeze for one year, a strict cap on every route for any future fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the cheapest ticket for their journey.  The cost, of just over £200 million, will be fully funded by switching spending within the existing transport budget from delaying road projects on the A27 and A358 for which the economic case is still uncertain.  Not raising taxes  We will not raise the basic or higher rate of Income Tax, National Insurance or VAT. Nor will we extend VAT to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers or public transport fares. Instead, we will cut taxes for working families by bringing in a lower starting 10p rate of income tax by reversing the Tories’ Marriage Tax Allowance.  Protecting tax credits  Labour will protect tax credits that working families rely upon so they rise in line with inflation from next year, not cut them as the Tories plan.  Setting up a national primary childcare service  The Tories have let down working families by scrapping the legal requirement to provide after-school or breakfast clubs and allowing numbers to fall with only half of parents able to find suitable term-time childcare to fit with their working hours. Only 17 local authorities in England able to provide after-school clubs at all primary schools.  Today Labour is announcing a new National Primary Childcare Service, underpinning a legal right to guaranteed access to wrap-around childcare in breakfast or after-school clubs from 8am-6pm.  This will increase the amount of affordable wrap-around childcare by delivering it through CRB-vetted volunteers and using the lower overheads of primary schools. And it will increase the amount of high quality childcare by providing a route for talented people from arts, sports or music organisations to bring their skills and expertise into primary schools.  The NPCS will be a not-for-profit organisation acting as a hub to match primary schools with volunteers and a range of quality extracurricular sports, art and music activities before and after school. It will be paid for by ending Government funding for the New Schools Network, an organisation set up to promote the Free Schools programme.   In some of these cases, the policy isn't exactly 'new' but the detail is."

LabourUK,32fget,can_triforce,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"I wrote this on the LabourList article by Mark Ferguson titled 'Labour’s Manifesto – Where Blue Labour meets “Brown Labour”':   I'm glad to see it, though I'd actually like to have seen a little more influence from thinkers like Cruddas. The future of socialism is not found in the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of an increasingly corrupt and unaccountable state, nor in allowing the market free-reign over our lives and communities. Real socialism must be about putting power into the hands of ordinary people: Giving communities power over the decisions that matter to them, against the power of both the state and market. On some things like railways, nationalisation might be the answer (as they seem to be a natural monopoly), but on others, we (the left) really need to ask ourselves if the answer is really to just nationalise, nationalise, nationalise. This supposed dichotomy between 'state' and 'free-market' is a false one.  A key thing missing from this manifesto for me was that nowhere that I could see did it talk about co-operatives and mutuals. Workers should own and have an influence and stake in the businesses in which they work, that should be the bar set for any party claiming to be a Social Democratic one. Labour should be doing far more to encourage citizens to create their own small co-operative businesses. It means more economic democracy, fairness, a greater emphasis on mutualism and reciprocity among communities, and another buffet against the forces of both state and unaccountable corporations. It encourages social and community cohesion and strengthens the bond between individuals, giving them a stake in their workplace and a sense of place in an increasingly globalised world. They mentioned the word 'co-operative' once in the entire manifesto, only mentioning them in regards to the British Investment Bank, though how that actually relates to co-operatives I've yet to see."

Commentariat are impressed and this close to the election some normal people will hopefully hear or read it -- or at least some extracts. He compares himself with Attlee, Wilson and Blair (the three Labour leaders who beat the Conservatives in an election), while distancing himself from Blair on Iraq and inequality, obliquely answers the 'Who will voters want in a room with Putin?' question by asking 'Who will voters want in a room with Murdoch/the energy companies/etc?' and, probably most importantly in the great scheme of things, calls time on trickle-down economics:   Because for too long, you have been told something that simply isn’t true.  That’s what’s good for the richest and most powerful is always good for the whole of our country.  That as long as a few individuals and companies are OK, we can just wait for the wealth to trickle down to everyone else.  With one rule for the few and another rule for the many.  And what does it mean under this government?  Insecurity for millions as the prescription for economic success.  Everyday people having to pay the price of hard times.  Young people fated to have a worse life than their parents.  And public services cut back to the core.  We’ve had five years of these ideas.  We’ve had five years of this experiment.  And it has failed.   Obviously we might say 'Five years? More like thirty-five' but whatever. My general response to the speech was: 'Hell, yes', obviously. For me, he's never really failed the 'Picture him in Number 10' test but I'm now struggling to picture him anywhere else."

LabourUK,327y5s,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Sat Apr 11 13:10:16 2015 UTC,"Really? This is a list of all of the two parties' announced policies on the subject, courtesy of the BBC Manifesto Watch:    Conservatives: * No increase in benefits for working-age people for two years to save £3bn. Affects those receiving jobseekers' allowance, income support, tax credits and child benefit. * Cut maximum amount a household can claim each year from £26,000 to £23,000. * Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in ""community projects"". * 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. * Young people out of work, education or training for six months will have to do unpaid community work to get benefits. This will apply to about 50,000 18 to 21-year-olds. * Universal benefits for pensioners, such as free bus passes, TV licences for the over 75s and the winter fuel allowance will once again be protected.    Labour: * Rises in child benefit capped at 1% for the first two years of the next parliament. * Winter fuel allowance would be withdrawn from the wealthiest pensioners. * Repeal what the government calls the spare room subsidy, dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour. * A million interest-free loans to help people insulate their homes. * Double the amount of paid paternity leave available to new fathers from two to four weeks, and increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week. *  Guarantee a job for under 25s unemployed for over a year and adults unemployed for more than two years.  The whole ""they're all the same"" trope really pisses me off, especially when it comes from people who are actively interested in politics. Of course Labour doesn't want to be the party of keeping people on benefits- no-one does. People who are unemployed but capable of work do not want to stay on benefits- they want to be helped back to work. Every party agrees with this point, Greens included. That's just rhetoric, though; what matters is what you do about it. Every single one of Labour's policy is about giving better things to people in order to more effectively help them, with two exceptions- removing the Winter Fuel Allowance from the richest, and capping child benefit rises to 1%. On the contrary, every single Conservative policy on the subject (with the exception of Pensioner things) is either a cut, a removal, or a cap."

Both will keep trident.  Both will continue policies of economic austerity.  Neither will tackle the problem of economic inequality (which got progressively worse under Labour).  Neither will actively work to create democratic electoral system.  Both will continue to blame immigration and the poor for the recession.  Both will continue to privatise the NHS.  Neither will nationalise the railways.  Neither will nationalise the energy industry.  Neither will scrap academy schools.

LabourUK,327y5s,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Sat Apr 11 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"Both will keep Trident   Which most people want. Democracy!   austerity   Is a word, not a policy. Labour and Tory policy in the area of reducing the deficit is very different. Labour will borrow for infrastructure, the Tories won't. Labour are not promising a precise timetable, the Tories are (even though they've shown such a timetable to be useless in this Parliament)   inequality   Are you kidding me? Cracking down on tax avoidance, raising taxes on property and high incomes, lowering VAT, introducing apprenticeships for half of all school leavers, raising the minimum wage, encouraging the living wage and cutting business rates vs. raising VAT, lowering taxes, for high earners, restricting trade union activity and pretending inequality isn't happening/doesn't matter/is someone else's fault?   Neither will actively work to create democratic electoral system.   Labour will introduce an elected House of Lords, just as Labour abolished the hereditary principle in the House of Lords. The Tories blocked an elected house of Lords just a couple of years ago.   Both will continue to blame immigration and the poor for the recession.   Ed Balls was on the TV this morning pointing out that the recession happened because of a crash in the US mortgage market. Actually, this particular accusation can't be levelled at either side, because the Tories blame Labour and public borrowing, not 'immigration and the poor'. Labour also have very different policies on immigration, which link strongly into their policies on inequality. The aim is to prevent exploitation, not immigration.   NHS   The NHS won't be privatised if people don't want it to be. Private services offering some treatments isn't the same as privatisation.   Political compass   Political Compass is a total joke. It's really completely useless -- it has me, a middle-of-the-road social democrat as more 'libertarian' than Gandhi -- an anarchist -- and more left wing than Stalin, who nationalised an entire economy."
LabourUK,327y5s,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"Austerity is a macro economic ideological posistion. It is one all the parties funded by big corporate donors and the super rich subscribe to. You can argue Labour have different micro economic ideals, but that is nowhere near as important.  Political reform has to look at voting systems, first past the post harms the progressive majority in the country. Labour would rather be second forever to the Tories than see them beat but become unimportant.  Inequality skyrocketed under Labour.   Labour is rife with people and funders who benefit from carving up the NHS. Look at Blair."
LabourUK,327y5s,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Mon Apr 13 10:44:27 2015 UTC,"Austerity is none of those things. Labour and the Conservatives practised austerity during and after the Second World War, when Keynesian economics was the order of the day. Cuba continues to practise austere politics to this day.  There's no evidence that more proportional voting systems lead to more 'progressive' politics (note that even if it did, this wouldn't itself be a reason to adopt them).  Inequality skyrocketed under the last Labour government, yes, but that doesn't mean Labour is unconcerned by it now, nor that they will do nothing about it. I've listed for you some of the ways that they will tackle inequality.  Labour saved the NHS last time, privatisation or no. They cut waiting times and raised survival rates. Everything else is just small print. Given Labour's plans to stop MPs from holding directorships at companies, much of the concern you have about voting patterns being influenced by extra-parliamentary commitments will be allayed by the policies Labour will implement once in power."
LabourUK,327y5s,AnxiousMo-Fo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:13:36 2015 UTC,"Political reform has to look at voting systems, first past the post harms the progressive majority in the country. Labour would rather be second forever to the Tories than see them beat but become unimportant.   Labour campaigned on the ""Yes to AV"" side of the referendum (not exactly with great gusto, but still). I know that AV is only a poor man's voting reform, but you can thank the Lib Dems / Tories for that one; we could only campaign on the referendum we were given. And yes Blair was a weasel about it back in 1997, but all I can recommend on that front is ""don't vote for Tony Blair this time"". Writing off the whole party forever for Blair's nonsense (on any point) is silly; you've got to judge the people that are actually on offer this time around, and Miliband is in no world a Blairite (however much Labour's rivals on the left wish he was).   Neither will nationalise the railways.   From today's manifesto (although it was announced months ago):   We will legislate  so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the  private train operating companies on a level playing field.     That's nationalisation, you know. Or it's ""nationalisation wherever it makes economic sense to do so""- which seems grand to me. I wouldn't want to be nationalising where a private company genuinely could do better, I just happen to believe that that will, on cool reflection, rarely be the case..."
LabourUK,327wld,Patch86UK,2,Sat Apr 11 10:40:27 2015 UTC,"We will scrap expensive Police and Crime Commissioners, end the police subsidy of gun licenses and introduce a new requirement for joint procurement and shared services to raise £800million in the first three years which Chief Constables will be able to use to protect over 10,000 police officers as well as PCSOs.   Really glad about that. There are few worse policies in the last five years than the stupid PCCs. What a great way of introducing something expensive that no-one wants, with the only possible ""positive"" effect being...the politicisation of the police force? It will not be missed."

Norman Baker, who has responsibilities for shotgun certificates, said he has been frustrated by the decision to block plans to raise the cost of gun licences, forcing police services to find more than £17m from their operational budgets to subsidise them."

Sounds like Labour really do need more money if we're going to win this.  The only saving grace is the Short Money Labour receive by virtue of being the Opposition. That's a little misleading when looking at the ""total"", though, seeing as it is given explicitly to counteract all the support the Government parties receive in the form of Civil Service time, which is not counted in the Electoral Commission's figures. As the Short Money is calculated especially to match the Civil Service advantage, you can basically add the same amount as Labour are receiving to the Conservative and Lib Dem budgets as ""hidden money""."

In each of the last four years, the ""total"" for Labour is higher only because of the Short Money (in the Public Funds column), which I explained above...   As the Short Money is calculated especially to match the Civil Service advantage, you can basically add the same amount as Labour are receiving to the Conservative and Lib Dem budgets as ""hidden money"".   You'll notice in 2009 (when Conservatives were the Opposition), they had more money in their ""Public Funds"" column instead- this is because they were the ones getting the Short Money at that point, whereas Labour were benefiting from the Civil Service support (not counted in those figures)."

However, Ed's definitely got Labour supporters straining at the leash: Hopefully that'll mean more donations, more doorknocking, etc., and that'll help us win. If Labour supporters were coming away shrugging or disappointed, we'd be dead. But they're not. So we're not."

As was mentioned above though, shocking performance from Kay and Paxman - half the questions were about David, and the other half were thinly veiled insults. Cameron seemed to get more soft ball questions from the crowd too. This just makes Milibands victory all the sweeter though - he really did well in an extremely hostile environment."

The current Lords/Senate proposal seems to include ""regional PR"", too (that is, where each region would select its senators proportionally, although the differing populations of each region would prevent it being wholly proportional on a national scale).  Personally I was all for AV, and think AV+ or the Additional Member system would be fine ideas in the UK General Election context."

LabourUK,308lho,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Mar 25 10:30:22 2015 UTC,"Read the Labour List article for a full explanation of what it is, and the following from Jon Ashworth, General Election Campaign Deputy:   The Tories have a plan to win this election: they will refuse to tell the truth about their own record of failure in government, and they will try to smear our party, our leader, and our vision for the country too.  It’s as simple as it is ugly — and they’re going to be spending huge sums of money on everything from glossy leaflets to targeted online ads to do it. We can’t outspend the Tories to rebut their smears, and we can’t rely on the media to do it for us (spoiler: they won’t). So we’re taking matters into our own hands — and that’s where you come in.   We’re calling it the Labour Response Team — a team of grassroots activists fighting back by exposing the Tories’ dirty tactics and highlighting their real record.  I’m looking to recruit a few thousand of Labour’s most committed  members and supporters to join this new team — and I want you to be a part of it.  Here’s how it works: when the Tories attack us or try to run from their record, we’ll email you with the facts you need to know and a  graphic, article or blog post to share however you like (on Facebook,  Twitter or over email, for example).  It may not sound like much, but people often trust people they know more than the politicians they see on TV. Your voice will carry weight– and working together, we can make sure the facts drown out the Tory spin.  So, will you join our Response Team?  Today is a good example of the Tories’ real agenda. They are refusing to come clean about their plans to raise VAT after the election, but  they’ve tried this before – three times in the last few elections, Tory chancellors have raised VAT after promising they had no plans to do so.  This is exactly the kind of thing we need to be highlighting.  Will you join the Labour Response Team to help do it?"
LabourUK,308lho,MagicBreadRoll,4,Wed Mar 25 10:33:10 2015 UTC,"You have my axe.  Sounds like ""keyboard warriors"" but I would love to just share the facts and set the record straight every time people mutter ""Labour broke the banks"". :)"

LabourUK,308bbd,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Wed Mar 25 12:01:44 2015 UTC,"Firstly, they have committed to raising taxes to cut the UK’s £90 billion yearly budget deficit (i.e. the 50p rate, Mansion tax, bankers’ bonus tax, a higher bank levy), while Osborne has pledged to focus on spending cuts rather than tax rises.   I've never seen Labours commitment to raise an extra £90 billion in new taxes. What's the evidence base for this?"
LabourUK,308bbd,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Mar 25 10:33:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say they're going to raise £90 billion in new taxes: It says they will raise taxes which will contribute to cutting the £90 billion deficit, in contrast to the Tories who think they can do the whole thing just through spending cuts."

LabourUK,308bbd,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Mar 25 11:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well, Maths isn't my forte but... About £10 billion?  Labour don't include spending for infrastructure and investment in their definition of 'austerity', so their whole approach is different from the Conservatives."
LabourUK,308bbd,JoeSalmonGreen,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:22:41 2015 UTC,I was being facetious.
LabourUK,308bbd,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Wed Mar 25 11:56:11 2015 UTC,"It's the article's clumsy wording. The deficit is £90bn, but nobody (neither Labour nor the Tories) are planning to cut £90bn. The next paragraph cleans it up:   It means that while Coalition had planned over £55 Billion in spending cuts, Labour had pledged only to plug potentially a £4 Billion gap – which could even come from tax rises.    £4bn is relatively easy to plug with taxes. The mansion tax on its own is set to raise almost half that."
LabourUK,308bbd,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Wed Mar 25 11:27:40 2015 UTC,"So that difference of £55 billion is that over the first year in government or the whole time in power? £55 Billion isn't that much over the course of a whole parliament, it's probably less than the margin's of error in making predictions about the budget. Annually £500 billion is collected in Taxes, we're not talking huge sums here.  I've had trouble finding the bit in the article that shows a major difference between the two parties. In my mind they are both parties of austerity, I wish that wasn't the case so I'm hoping you can show different."
LabourUK,308bbd,AnxiousMo-Fo,2,Wed Mar 25 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"That would be £55 billion per year (""per budget"", if you like).   £55 Billion isn't that much ... we're not talking huge sums here.   You are kidding right? £50bn is more than the entire education budget, or the entire defence budget, or the entire welfare budget. You could fit the entire national transport budget into that number five times over.   The difference between cutting £55bn per year (as per the Tories) and Labour's single digit cuts is the difference between cutting the equivalent of every penny this country spends on schools, colleges and universities, or the equivalent of... well... not doing that. Taxing a few millionaire's homes instead."

First this one: http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/labour-and-tories-aren-t-same-so-why-do-voters-still-think-they-are    The Tories and Labour have extremely different targets in their election promises. Labour want to cut the ""structural deficit"" (day to day spending) until it's a surplus, while Tories want to cut both that and the ""capital deficit"" (investment in assets) as well. Sound tedious and technical? The up shot of it is that the Tories are planning to cut £33bn, while Labour are planning to shed only £7bn (or 80% less than the Tories, in other words).   What does that mean? On to the second source:  http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/labour-could-end-cuts-next-year-and-still-meet-deficit-targets-says-ifs To meet Osborne's targets, the Tories will need to keep cutting at greater than the current rate until 2020. To meet Ball's target, cutting at the current rate austerity will be all done and dusted by 2016- next year. So Labour literally will be ending austerity in the next parliament, compared to Osborne who thinks he might be able to do it during the NEXT one after that (although he said that 5 years ago, and here we are today).  So in essence, the choice between Labour and Conservatives is a choice between austerity ending next year, and austerity going on for ""the foreseeable future""."

What we do know is Ed has a different set of rules and wants to be less harsh.  Tune of £20-30 billion a year and won't limit investment spending. From my basic understanding fiscal multiplier spending is benefits and investment spending.  Current investment spending has been cut the most with obvious results being worse growth.  When you do the maths it pretty scary just how much money has been wasted around £400 billion from QE with £500 billion in extra borrowing not used for investment.   Just think what £500 billion could have done if it was invested in something useful for reference green party would spend £30 billion on new homes over 5 years.   Government spending is just transfers of wealth over costing money.  Just hope Labour is willing to be bold and start economic stimulus and reform the banks before the next crisis hits. If required take a hair cut and borrow at super cheap rates.  Who knows maybe Labour could start to fix the tax code.   Labour and Tories have not said what they would cut or how.

Personally I can't do that, I live in a marginal seat and I would rather not let the Conservatives win it by the back door by voting for an unrealistic option.   FPTP is the reason for this. Labour will not support PR because they are aware of the consequences for them should it be implemented, which makes them every bit as cynical, disengenuous and uninterested in democracy as their adversaries."

Sort of Liberal, but they've gone too far Orange Book. Sort of Labour, but they're Tory-Lite these days. Sort of Green in that I care about the environment, but they're not remotely competent... so I support individual MPs with (small) donations and my time (this year it will be two Lib Dems and two Labour) phone-banking, door-knocking or whatever they need.

Even ignoring that, the most obvious consequence of full reserve banking are LESS lending in the times you want MORE.   I actually like the idea of a basic income. I was convinced of it by this piece by the Adam Smith Institute (of all places!), and I actually prefer their proposed system to most alternatives. But that has to be paid for, and tax law needs fixing to close the loopholes that enable companies to avoid tax as they do now. That is a massively complex thing to do, the OECD put out a decent framework last year, but nobody is talking about it.   There is no argument that the Green economic platform is anti-business. While ""corporationism"" may be too pervasive, the ""solutions"" on the Greens policy site would, at best, cripple the economy and kick off a recession that makes 2008 look like a hiccup.   I'm an accountant and (amateur) economist, and nobody with an understanding of business or macro economics had anything to do with the drafting of that section of your policy platform. Just one example: EC805 essentially ends the pensions industry in this country. Think through for a moment the consequences of that. If you can't see the calamity that would cause then I can only hope someone buys you a copy of Macroeconomics for Dummies for Christmas.  No party is perfect, but Greens need their ideologies to line up with reality rather more than it does at the moment before I can support them... which is a bit of a shame, because I'm a natural lefty; I believe the state should look after those who need it... but I also believe that needs to be paid for, and the real world exists, and capitalism isn't going anywhere."

The deadline for submitting changes to PSS is something like May 12th (or at least you have to say you are going to submit something by then). I'm already going to be doing a lot of stuff on digital rights. If you can really spot serious holes in the economic ideas then I'd like to get on and fix them."
LabourUK,2z3rvj,JoeSalmonGreen,2,Sun Mar 15 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"The principle that banks ""create"" money through debt is simply false. They do not. They cannot. That is the function of the central bank - it is the very definition of monetary policy. Money circulates through the economy (or parts of it) - this diagram is a reasonable (if simple) model. It doesn't show the amount of money in the economy, but essentially when one of those arrows is held up for some reason (e.g. a recession causing households to spend less on consumption) increasing the overall supply can boost things a little. This is a massive over-simplification, but I don't know if you've ever studied any economics so I'm keeping it broad-strokes.  So, full reserve banking: Currently banks take your savings, lend them out to someone else, make money, give you a slice of it as interest and pocket the rest. What full reserve says is that they can't do that any more, they have to have all your money available to you at any time. Yours and everone elses, so there's no money for them to lend out to make money from (we're sticking to retail banking here, investment is a whole other thing). So current capital requirement is complex wiki and enhanced by BoE rules on banks which carry systemic risk probably not worth reading if you're unfamiliar with finance at all - essentially you're asking to go from ~10% tier 1 to 100% (and eliminating any risk weighting).   Where does that money come from? Over what time period are the banks supposed to find these hundreds of billions? I'm assuming they'll have to retain all profits until the goal is met, but that could still take decades.  Even when it's done they can then only lend from reserves, are they required to be 100% too? How do you record the asset of a loan on the balance sheet? At the moment it's essentially value * risk. A £1000 loan to someone who is 99.98% likely to pay it back is worth £999? Or £1000? Or £1010 with interest? These things matter, and the rules which govern them are national, and international and complicated.   So, now your savings can't be lent out, you receive no interest on your savings and unless inflation has stopped being a thing, your money is now losing value as it sits there. As your bank can't make money from your savings any more, you are almost certainly paying a fee.   Finally let me encourage you to read this article by Frances Coppola, a well respected economist, analyst and former banker (and a very nice lady who helped me out a lot when I first started studying this stuff).   Soooooo, onto Green economic policies...   Honestly, there is a lot wrong with a lot of the core principles, but I only have so much time today. Using this page and skipping a lot of it.   Up top there is a lot of generalisations and principles, which are lovely, but I need to know what that looks like in reality. ""reducing the physical burden they place on the planet"" is a nice line. What does that look like? We all have to stop driving? No more electricity from coal? No more plastics? HOW do we relieve that burden, just saying we should is not enough. I'd REALLY like to know how you make EC202 happen, it ignores human nature let alone modern society.   The ""Indicators"" section is interesting. The first paragraph is simply incorrect, those economic indicators serve valuable functions. Bhutan famously uses Gross National Happiness as a key metric... but they also use all of the others, one does not discount the other. Perhaps we should focus more on GNH, but Happiness is diminished when the wider economy is in the toilet. By all means adopt EC311 along side those measures in EC310, but to dismiss them completely is naive at best.   The objectives in EC401 are, at best, hopeful. Again human nature cannot be ignored and while providing for the basic needs of many will go a long way for some, there will always be others who have that drive to get ahead, and there will always be fields in which they can do so.   I'll skip the rest of the 400s, CI is covered later (ish). I would like to see a number soon. This is economic policy, right? ""a reasonable rate"" means nothing at all. Centrally directed R&D aimed at an economy which doesn't exist is just amusing to me (in fact most of 407 doesn't make a lot of sense).   The 500s are all localism, which is something I don't fully understand. Energy policy needs to be national. So does defence. So does infrastructure. So does Health. So does (most) tax policy. I don't see decentralisation and localism as the answer to the problems we face. Yes, we're London-centric, that's not going to change any time soon, it's one city with 25% of the population, 22% of the GDP (at least, figures vary). These people, and these businesses are not going to pack up and move to Hull.   600s... now we're getting into my area! Show me the data, baby!   Wait, what?   There are no numbers.   On a policy page about the national economy, there are no numbers. There is no costing of anything. There is no predictions about the effect of anything. There are paragraphs upon paragraphs of idealism, but not a number in sight.   You can't just ignore numbers. This is economics, not sociology (and my apologies to sociologists). You can't just use phrases like ""appropriate national public expenditure"" because the very next question anyone like me, or any journalist, or anyone who isn't already ideologically ""Green"" for other reasons will ask is: ""what does that mean?"". I'd love a party on the left to talk about national infrastructure spending, and make the Keynsian argument.. but that requires a ""this will cost £x, with a return on investment expected to be £y, and a long term benefit of [outcome]Z.""    EC650 The unaccountable exercise of economic power by large corporations has done much to destroy the environment and convivial social structures. Green policies will establish greater community and environmental accountability.   What does that look like, then? Let's say I have a couple of hundred shares in Tesco I bought years ago. The dividend payments normally pay for a holiday, or Christmas, or whatever the hell else I want to spend them on... Tesco are a massive corporation, partly responsible for the death of the high-street, putting butchers out of business since the 80s  etc etc, they're not a Green-y localist company.  Are you going to take them from me? How? Forced sale? If so, at what price? If you're not going to force me to sell how are you going to make this massive company more local? By forcing the pension funds who own most of it to sell? Well, maybe, because later on you essentially destroy that whole sector (with no comment on what happens to people who have pension funds with those companies now) Break it up? How? How are you going to impose your will over corporations to bring about this local Nirvana?  Co-operatives section is surprisingly okay, but if the co-op bank farce has taught us anything, it's that there is a disconnect between co-ops and the wider market, don't push too hard. Still no numbers.   The entire monetary policy section is just wrong.    EC660 In a Green society the informal sector will eventually gain in significance so that formal transactions and money generally will have a lesser role than at present.   My landlord will be thrilled. As will the electricity supplier. Pipe-dream nonsense. It's almost as bad as the Tories longing for the Britain of the 1950s that never really existed. You're building a fantasy world which ignores reality - the result of which is that people who have to live in reality get screwed.   661 - Wrong. That money is real money, that it's not printed is simply because it is not required to be printed, money doesn't circulate in paper and coin any more. I pay my bills right out of my bank account, likewise my butcher and baker and supermarket. I don't need those notes and coins.  Still, it's nice to see a % sign on the economics page, even if it is being used completely out of context.   662 - banks still don't create money.   663 - Banks. Do. Not. Create. Money.   664 - entirely based on the premise that banks create money. They don't.   ... and now I have to go cook. Might come back to this tonight."
