Columbus,3e3om2,MiniAndretti,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"Beats me. In classic blogspam fashion, 614NOW linked to an ABC News article from 4 days ago that linked to this list on Foursquare from 2 weeks ago. I'm guessing they just went by user ratings."
Columbus,3e3om2,nicogor,6,Tue Jul 21 19:48:58 2015 UTC,O Betty's is far superior to Dirty Franks.
Columbus,3e3om2,EugeneVictorTooms,14,Tue Jul 21 22:31:37 2015 UTC,Way better.  Dirty Frank's isn't even close.
Columbus,3e3om2,GoGreenGiant,5,Tue Jul 21 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"First off, Dirty Franks is a terrible place to buy a hot dog. They Suck. Has anyone actually ordered a hot dog there? And no, I'm not talking about the awesome chicago style whatever the fuck with tomatoes and pickles and shit, I mean an actual plain fucking hot dog. That guy comparing them to Giant Eagle Get-Go is completely correct. I don't want any of that shit, I want a fucking hot dog. That's what I came there for, that's what I want from a place that sells hotdogs.   What I get is plain, boiled or steamed weak ass tiny hot dog in a soggy ass bun. They don't even toast that shit?!?!. I don't care if you get some awesome abomination with tator tots and unicorn farts on it, the underlying hotdog SUCKS.  That being said, my long time contender for the best hotdog in Columbus has been the Nationwide Plaza 1 Cafeteria. Aweosme, big, thick dogs, they split them and grill them right up for you, and toast the bun. I didn't think it could be beat, but...  Since going to Daredevil dogs, I can honestly say that they serve the best plain hotdog in Columbus. Huge hotdogs, grilled, toasted buns, it's like a giant fucking polish sausage. And yes, you can gets all sorts of pickles and shit on it too, the difference is a solid base.   An awesome hotdog.  Fuck yo pickles & tots, Dirty Franks"
Columbus,3e3om2,about_that_life,3,Tue Jul 21 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, I am one of the owners of DareDevil Dogs.  We really appreciate that you like our food, we spent a lot of time sourcing the best locally baked buns and local hot dogs we could find.   A little bit of shameless self promo, we have three days left on our  Kickstarter for a food truck! We have some great rewards including discounted food. I completely understand when people say they don't want to support it! Next time you come in ask for Tom and I will buy you some tater tots!   Www.tinyurl.com/DareDogs"
Columbus,3e3om2,lol_admins_are_dumb,7,Tue Jul 21 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"They're fine, beef hot dogs. If you just want a plain hot dog, without toppings, dirty franks was the wrong place for you to go in the first place. The whole point is getting one with all the toppings on it. If I want an explosion of flavor in my mouth from my tube meat, I'm not going to smother it in toppings. I want a nice plain wiener when I smother it in baked beans and onions and cheese, to keep a balance. One component stealing the show in an ensemble is not enjoyable to me. Plus they offer other dogs available if you want something crazier."
Columbus,3e3om2,GoGreenGiant,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"I just want a hotdog, man. I get fancy toppings and all, but without a good base product (hotdog), it's just putting lipstick on the pig."
Columbus,3e3om2,lol_admins_are_dumb,6,Tue Jul 21 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"Cool, dirty franks is not the place for you. That doesn't mean it sucks. That just means you're going to the wrong place. Like I said, the whole point there is to get one with all the toppings on it. I don't go to ihop and get pissy that the chicken and waffles aren't up to par (which is a bit more of a stretch, but demonstrates my point). The hot dogs are entirely fine. They are not performing a solo act and as such it would make no sense to get a more in-your-face weiner there. Did you notice the alternate dogs section on the menu btw?"
Columbus,3e3om2,GoGreenGiant,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the whole point there is to get one with all the toppings on it. I don't go to ihop and get pissy that the chicken and waffles aren't up to par   I get what you're saying, and I'll concede that the experience, toppings and whatever makes it what it is. different strokes and all, I'm not tying to put you down.  But I absolutely would get pissy if I went to IHOP and they had shitty pancakes, which I think is the whole point of a hotdog / pancake joint. Regardless of the fancy toppings they try to dress it up with."
Columbus,3e3om2,lol_admins_are_dumb,4,Tue Jul 21 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"But dirty franks never claimed to be ""a great place to get a good old fashioned hot dog"". In fact they go so far as to make fun of them in their menu by calling it a Glenn Beck. The whole schtick has always been ""get a zany dog with cool art on the walls and good tasty beer selection"".  Side note, in my opinion, ihop does make some crappy pancakes, they just dress them up with all kinds of syrups and fruits and nuts and ice creams and whatever the fuck :P"
Columbus,3e3om2,EugeneVictorTooms,6,Tue Jul 21 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"I would never go to a pizza joint that depended on their toppings to cover up their shitty crust.  People like Dirty Frank's and that's cool, but I wish everyone would stop acting like it's the best thing since sliced bread.  Village Coney is better and way less full of itself."
Columbus,3e3om2,DeadRussian88,9,Tue Jul 21 23:28:51 2015 UTC,What he said. I've had it a few times and was not impressed. Their dogs are generic and only alright. I'd much rather go to Acme.
Columbus,3e3om2,BluesCaravan,4,Tue Jul 21 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"Dirty Franks is probably among the worst hotdogs I've ever had in my life.  They are skinny, bland turds that they have to cover in five thousand different kinds of toppings to make it edible.  The only redeeming thing about the place is that they have Frostop on draught."
Columbus,3e3om2,Harb67,6,Tue Jul 21 22:19:57 2015 UTC,"They clearly haven't tried Daredevil Dogs.    Pick up an 8-pack of Oscar Meyer hot dogs, some Schwebels buns, a can of generic topping chili, and a bag of Fritos and you've got a Dirty Frank's meal.  Does nobody else notice that Dirty Franks uses ingredients that can be picked up at a well-stocked gas station?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills."
Columbus,3e3om2,DJ-Salinger,7,Tue Jul 21 19:14:33 2015 UTC,Both are good.
Columbus,3e3om2,scottth1,8,Tue Jul 21 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, place is very average."
Columbus,3e3om2,sermandertis,3,Tue Jul 21 19:33:10 2015 UTC,I just tried it for the first time after hearing good reviews and.... I agree with you. I didn't really get it.
Columbus,3e3om2,virak_john,8,Tue Jul 21 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Not buying it.   You're not going to find Kimchi, fried leeks, Tater tots, grilled sauerkraut, sriracha slaw, mustard greens, baklava, beef brisket, mango chutney or Jeni's Ice Creams at a service station. Nor will you get full bar and a great selection of craft beers.   Daredevil Dogs may be great. But you don't have to piss on Frank's to assert that. And for what it's worth, the restaurant experience is more than ingredients or even recipes. Dirty Frank's has a great brand concept and is, to a lot of people, really fun."
Columbus,3e3om2,DeepOringe,5,Tue Jul 21 19:39:13 2015 UTC,I agree that the #1 selling point of Dirty Franks is that it's fun.
Columbus,3e3om2,Harb67,2,Tue Jul 21 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not pissing on Dirty Franks to make Daredevil look good - each place falters or stands on their own merits, respectively.  Ok, so half of the menu requires that you leave the GetGo and cross the parking lot to the full Giant Eagle, I'll give you that.  The place is wholly unimpressive.  If I'm going to pay someone else to make me a hot dog they had better present something above and beyond what I can manage in my own kitchen.  Get some fancy seasoned all-beef ballpark-size franks.  Use something other than the most generic of buns.  Hell, just make it look like the dog actually saw a grill for more than a few seconds.  Also, we're in Columbus - you don't get points for having a craft beer selection.  Every place in town has a 'great craft beer selection'.    That being said, I agree that the ""restaurant experience is more than ingredients or even recipes.""  I really don't mind going to the west side location when my friends are in the mood because it's large enough that you can be seated and fed in a reasonable amount of time.  I'd never go out of my way to drive myself out there, though.  The ""experience"" at the downtown location is, as far as I'm concerned, insulting.  Wait an eternity to overpay for mediocre food in a tiny, cramped dining area?  No thanks.  I'll go Little Palace two doors north.  Anyway, enjoy what you want to enjoy.  I'm just backing up my opinion because it's 4pm and I've got an hour to kill."
Columbus,3e3om2,GoGreenGiant,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:01 2015 UTC,100% agree
Columbus,3e3om2,DeepOringe,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"I love Little Palace. I went there once because of Dirty Frank's overcrowding, and now it's my first choice!"
Columbus,3e3om2,lol_admins_are_dumb,2,Tue Jul 21 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, so half of the menu requires that you leave the GetGo and cross the parking lot to the full Giant Eagle, I'll give you that.    You just described most restaurants. You don't go there because they're serving incredibly rare ingredients, you go there because they take your standard ingredients, prepare it will, balance the flavors, and provide a good atmosphere and not to mention the good selection of drinks available. This isn't really a con against any place you go to eat."
Columbus,3e3om2,about_that_life,2,Tue Jul 21 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the compliment man! I am one of the owners of DareDevil Dogs. We pride ourselves on using locally baked buns, Ohio Proud meats and making everything(other then ketchup, mayo and mustard) in house from scratch."
Columbus,3e3om2,OhMyWhatIsThat,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:56:48 2015 UTC,Daredevil dogs is a rip off. Double the price for in my opinion the same quality.
Columbus,3e3om2,about_that_life,0,Tue Jul 21 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"I am sorry to hear you feel that way. We pride ourselves on using high quality ingredients. We use all Ohio Proud meats, locally baked buns and we make every topping we serve in house from scratch. Our dogs are also all of a 1/5 of a lb. Although it isn't on the menu(just waiting on a re-print) yet we also offer your standard size hot dog of still Ohio Proud meat and local bun for $2.25. We want to provide our guests with a different option to Dirty Franks. We are also adding a lamb and chorizo sausage to the menu."
Columbus,3e3om2,Chanman_614,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel as well. They both taste equally good to me, and I'll go with the cheaper option most of the time.  That being said, Daredevil Dogs will definitely fill you up more"
Columbus,3e3om2,about_that_life,3,Tue Jul 21 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"I've almost been there a couple of times, but honestly even if it's the most amazing hot dog in History, my brain can't bring itself to justify buying a $6.50 hot dog."
Columbus,3e3om2,Chanman_614,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I can provide a little bit of info to justify the price. First all the dogs are 1/5 of a lb, roughly double the size of your standard hot dog. We use all local meat and locally baked buns. We sous vide all of our brats to make sure they are cooked perfectly every time. We also offer your standard size hot dog for only $2.25, so you don't have to spend $6.50, the only dogs that cost that are our specialty dogs. Thanks for giving us a try and hopefully we can convince you to come in again!"

Columbus,3e2hn1,xYike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"It is true, you're responsible for selling 20 tickets (which totals to $300), I'll let you know how it goes and if it's worth it. Each participant needs to sell 20 tickets and there's around 60 participants, so there should be around over a thousand people in attendance, so hopefully the exposure will be good!"

Columbus,3e2rot,stephentszuter,5,Tue Jul 21 14:48:16 2015 UTC,The elevator was put in for One Nationwide restaurant so that customers could go to the restaurant without going through NW offices. When the restaurant was closed the floor was converted into office space and there is no need for the elevator anymore.
Columbus,3e2rot,HiggsPosse,8,Tue Jul 21 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"I know that it used to operate when I was younger, but the down time was almost constant. Something was always breaking on it and it was out of service. I remember if I was downtown it was always awesome if it was actually open and we could ride up it.  At one time there was an exclusive restaurant at the top of the Nationwide building and you could ride up the elevator to reach it. That would be awesome now, it's a shame it isn't still there.   Unofficial answer: It was expensive to maintain, broke a lot, and not practical anymore."
Columbus,3e2rot,GoGreenGiant,7,Tue Jul 21 14:53:17 2015 UTC,"Once, after a big hungover brunch at the restaurant up there, my roommate pulled off a pretty good elevator-fart-walk-off, leaving the people getting on the elevator after us in his cropdust wake. It's not why the elevator is closed, I just thought it was a cool story, bro."
Columbus,3e2rot,velvta,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"When I was little and my parents and I would visit Columbus, we would stay at the Hyatt Regency and my parents would request a room with a view of the Nationwide Building so I could watch the elevator go up and down, and then one time during the weekend, my dad would take me over and we'd ride it up and down.  The restaurant closed in 1997 and when we went back in the early 2000s (post 9/11) to ride it and were told by the security people that it was a ""security risk"" and wasn't open to the public. I guess at that point, they just decided to permanently close it.  EDIT: It looks like it was operational at least as recently as 2009: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv4fZhLWKk4"

We'll start out with about an hour to an hour and a half of presentations about various subjects related to IoT and entrepreneurship, such as people's experiences in working with startups, crowdfunding, so on and so forth, and for the remaining time it'll just be a meet and greet/networking opportunity for everyone!  Last time we held this event we also had a spot at the end of the presentations so that anyone in the audience who had a product idea/startup could pitch themselves to the audience if they were looking for collaborators.  The snacks'll be a surprise (there will definitely be chips) but I can 100% confirm the presence of beer~  Edit: Last time we held the event we had about 40 people attend and we had enough snack leftovers that we were still finishing them a week later, so you all will be verrrryyy well fed"

So you don't have to wait if you wanted to check something out.   Also their dvd selection is HUGE. They have a lot of rare horror and cult movies that that you're probably not going to find on Netflix or HBO and dvd's are only $1.00 a day.   Plus it's great to be able to walk through and look at movies that you've either forgotten about, or have never heard of before. Chances are the staff has seen it and can give you a good recommendation.  The staff is great.

(Completely killed). Ever.    China has less than 500 Type 99 tanks, that have just been developed, and are not even close to being as good as the Abrams. We have 8,700 Abrams.   We have 10 aircraft carriers. The good kind. Everyone else has 10. Combined. And they are mostly small ships that can launch helicopters.  There are 8,400 attack helicopters in the world. The U.S. has 6,400 of them. source  so exactly why do we need more of anything? The Pentagon doesn't even want more Abrams, but Congress keeps jamming it into the defense budget because reasons. It's cheaper to abandon all of the MRAPS used in Iraq and Afghanistan than bring them home, to the tune of millions (but I guess it's better than selling them to your local PD, so there's that).

They have 73 hunter-killers with which to patrol the South China Sea.  Complicated geopolitical stuff, but we're not exactly worried about the Chinese parking a nuclear sub off the coast of Manhattan and listening to our rock and roll music while they conduct missile drills. We're worried about the relatively constrained patch of ocean between China and Taiwan."

Well, that and China literally stealing islands from Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.   But you're also correct that tensions between China and Taiwan exist for many of the same reasons that China is creating tension with other countries.....they like to take what isn't theirs. Oh say, like the entire country of Taiwan for example."

Columbus,3dyrxz,Sibolt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"I'm just listening to Ron Paul and the figures I've found have mainland China and China listed as different holders. Considering that social security has little to no money in it, but holds a majority of securities, the Chinese hold a much more substantial chunk. I hope we don't default on our national debt interest."
Columbus,3dyrxz,Dollar_Bills,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:51 2015 UTC,http://www.treasury.gov/ticdata/Publish/mfh.txt  This is the list of all foreign holders of US debt. Foreign debt is less than 50% of all U.S. Debt issued (over 50% is held domestically).   So that leaves China holding about 7% of all U.S. Debt that's been issued. Just the Social Security Trust fund holds almost twice what China holds. Most domestic debt is being held by public pension funds and private U.S. firms.

Columbus,3dzzin,0hdeargodno,4,Mon Jul 20 22:13:11 2015 UTC,A good time to go stargazing is mid August (11th-13th) for the Perseiod meteor shower. It happens annually and you can see more meteors during that time due to it's position than most other showers throughout the year. Usually of you just drive 20 minutes in any direction outside of 270 you should be able to see stars without light pollution being a problem.
Columbus,3dzzin,viciouslove80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"I would add that the direction you drive does matter to a certain extent. i.e. If you're looking to the northern sky - be sure you're north of Rt 36/Delaware. If you're looking for sky events in the southern sky, be sure that you're south of Scioto Downs or Circleville. Same for east/west."
