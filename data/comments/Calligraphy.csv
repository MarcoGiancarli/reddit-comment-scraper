Is there a way to do it that helps? Is there a certain pen or paper that makes it easier? I'm not talking about violent tremors, but enough to make intricate tasks difficult."
Calligraphy,3e05om,Sabine7,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"Avoid doing lettering that is small because most people write slower when writing small which will show up your tremor more.  Try putting more movement in your lettering, making letters in a gesture, so larger and quicker.  If you are comfortable try standing up.  This was done standing up because I wanted a lot of movement in the script, which was done as a gesture. With practice, you will be able to write faster, even at a smaller size.  By larger, I mean using a Brause 3 to 5, ruling pen or automatic pen perhaps.  Of course, it all depends what you are comfortable with.  One of my mentors developed a tremor in her late 60's and I watched how she handled it.  It got so bad she had to eventually stop lettering however she was still creative so switched to quilting and incorporates calligraphy into her cloth designs."

Calligraphy,3duy9w,thundy84,7,Sun Jul 19 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"So, I decided to give Carolingian a try for the first time last night. After writing the alphabet (based on Sheila Waters' exemplar in her book, Foundations of Calligraphy) once, I did three attempts on actual quotes. This is the third attempt. The first two can be seen on my IG account, if you’re curious as to what they look like. Anyhow, I know there are a few of us who are quite accomplished in Carolingian here, so constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. The x-height here is 2.5pw and ascenders/descenders at 4pw. The slant is at 5 degrees.      My own criticism: 1. There's a problem with my ascenders. On my first attempt, they too closely resembled the ascenders that I do in my Foundational. After a couple of tries, I decided to simply do an incomplete entasis stroke for all of them (pressure at top and releasing). I also did this for many (if not, most) of the stems of my letters, but I'm not sure if that's an entirely obvious thing. I'll eventually give the typical Carolingian ascenders a shot again relatively soon. 2. Spacing - I think this is relatively tight, which is entirely common for me. I kind of like the look of it, but I think I could definitely let them breathe a little bit more. 3. Ligatures - I mainly drew some ligatures from Sheila's Under the Milkwood excerpt. I'm sure there could be more and they could be better executed. (I just realized there aren't many here, but there are in my other attempts...lol) 4. Majuscules - I read that Carolingian can take on different majuscules, but I decided to go with Uncial. That ""H"" is awful though - it's too modern and probably too upright to really ""fit"" here. 5. Letterforms - I think I did relatively okay for the first attempt at the Carolingian letterforms, but I'm sure there's room to grow. Any and all suggestions appreciated.   Thanks for reading! :) And again, constructive criticism is greatly appreciated."
Calligraphy,3duy9w,cawmanuscript,7,Sun Jul 19 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"Well done and nice to see you trying this often under appreciated script.  As you asked,  I did notice a few quick points based on Sheila's ""Under Milk Wood"".  About your letterforms; your ""o"" is a bit too round as I showed someone else here.  Your 'n' should have more of a springing arch from the bottom.  A few others but they are very very minor.  Your spacing is a bit tight as you mentioned.  Choosing Uncial is a good choice for the majuscules.   Dont worrry about your ascenders if you are using UMW as an examplar.  Sheila modernized the traditional examples especially the ascenders, from a club serif to the almost Foundational one you used. She also changed the ""t"" into a more Foundational form.  But remember, Johnston used an English Caroline as the basis of his Foundational.   Sheila believes in using ligatures whenever possible, especially in Carolingian.  As in all your other scripts, you have a wonderful eye when you look at the letters and the skill to put them on paper.  Well done."
Calligraphy,3duy9w,headwhop26,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks much! :) -- I'll be sure to flatten the 'o' out a bit more in future attempts and will be sure to note that 'n' critique as well. I think I honestly like the effect of the ascenders that I used, so I might stick with it for a little bit. I don't like the effect of the club serifs as it tends to tear the paper (at least my practice ones). With regards to the 'spring,' I see what you mean. I'll definite note to do that for the 'n' family letters."

Custom orders, but will have ready to buy pens if you go to a workshop or a conference. Luis Chiang (Australia) - IG: @luis.creations - /u/mmgc will have more information.  Ashley Bush - IG: @ash_bush - I'm not sure, but I have seen her holders around on IG. I can't really attest to their quality since I don't personally own one.    That pretty much covers the ones that I know who make colorful oblique pen holders. There's many more out there, I'm sure. Prices are to my own knowledge and are, of course, subject to change according to the respective sellers."

Calligraphy,3dwn7f,thundy84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"I meant that you can mask off part of the pen, spray the exposed area, and when dry, remove the masking, mask another part of the pen, spray a different color, etc., until you get the colors on the pen where you want. The idea is very simple. You can have the ends remain natural black, add two gold bars an inch apart, and in between the bars a third color, for example. Nothing fancy."

At the moment, it looks like it might be a bit flat (looking at the top of your T, for instance). Another thing might be that your counters in your A's are very square compared with your majuscule. You can go for spiky Italic, but consistency is probably best. My preference would be to work on getting the first stroke of the O to give a nice inner shape, and then apply that to other letters. But feel free to disregard my noobie advice! :)"

Calligraphy,3du77z,lantern53,8,Sun Jul 19 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"Reddit is essentially a meritocracy—everyone with an account may ""upvote"" or ""downvote"" (or abstain) on any post, or comment, on the site; each vote is worth one point, meaning a downvote cancels out an upvote. Posts that have a high net vote count gain greater prominence to viewers—the rationale being that something a lot of people thought was really good will probably be interesting to you, too, while something that was negatively received will, on balance of probability, not appeal to you.  Things get a little more complicated when you are viewing the so-called “front page of reddit” because all subscribed subreddits compete for top billing. I don't know enough about the algorithms that decide what shows up first, but they are probably weighted by the number of votes divided by the number of subscribers for that subreddit—or something like that. Otherwise, big subreddits like /r/pics would always headline (where vote counts of around 5000-6000 are common) while even highly successful posts to small ones like ours (with, say, 300 net votes) would be buried dozens of page turns back.  Last but not least, posts also automatically lose prominence—regardless of their success—over time. 24 hours after posting, a post will never appear on the front page of the site. It will however still appear if you view the subreddit directly, but will not be displayed as prominently regardless of its success rate. New content will always be inserted above it and push older content further and further back.  In short, you're doing it already. If you want to gain better prominence, you have to make content that more people vote for. You can see the all-time highest-ranked posts for this subreddit here if you're curious."

They're to reiterate the proper space between the letters, showing a rhythm...They're not there for decoration.  I'm also curious, what's so unclear about the second one? If I recall correctly, you've criticized this style of Italic before. If you don't like that style, then by all means, that's perfectly fine. However, if you're going to provide constructive criticism, at least put it into the context of what the OP is intending. In this instance, ""Second line not clear"" is not helpful at all."

Calligraphy,3dn38m,Snyegurochka,4,Fri Jul 17 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"There is some small overlap in knowledge/skills between broad-edge calligraphy (hands like italic, foundational, gothic hands, etc.) and pointed-pen styles (copperplate, Spencarian, etc). If you don't really have an interest in learning a broad edge script, then don't spend your limited time practicing something that you don't want to do.  Pointed-pen scripts have a lot of technical aspects that are unique and don't carry over exactly into broad-edge styles.   TL/DR If your goal is to learn copperlate, then study copperplate."

Calligraphy,3dlm2e,MShades,6,Fri Jul 17 07:03:04 2015 UTC,"気をつけてね~ And you're absolutely right, your Italic has come so far. :) I do have some (nit-picky) things for you to think about though (but please, feel free to disregard as it is your Italic). 1. I love me some flourished Italic majuscules, but I think you might be a bit more careful in creating ones that don't look too fragile. Your ""L"" here, for example, has that pinched corner from the vertical to horizontal bottom stroke. I think if you minimize that a bit more, it'll create quite an elegant letterform. 2. Perhaps look into the balance of your 'e'. Currently, I think they're a little bit top heavy, particularly in the 'e' in ""the"" in the fourth line and the fifth line. I think the two in ""ourselves"" is probably the most balanced and in conformity with your Italic style. 3. Perhaps also try to be a little bit more conscious about that vertical stroke after the arch. There's a few places where it goes out of slope (particularly in the 'n'). I do note that I completely understand the difficulty of maintaining the slant out of that arch though....  If you want more feedback, I'd be glad to talk to you about it via skype/googlechat/whatevs. But that's entirely up to you! :) Again, I'm really happy to see just how far you've come along in your Italic. I do hope that these points are helpful. But again, it's your Italic, so you're more than welcome to disregard any/all of it!"

I'm working from the exemplars made by Elinor Holland, who taught a Copperplate class last month; Wikipedia says that Copperplate = English Roundhand, but I feel like I've seen the term ""Copperplate"" thrown about in a somewhat cavalier manner and applied to various scripts.  I am actually pretty confused when it comes to the distinguishing characteristics of the various pointed pen scripts; I looked at examples of Engrosser's and Roundhand on IAMPETH, and I found it difficult to tell the difference between them. (Indeed...one of the examples of Engrosser's is a certificate that states: ""...passed the required examination in Roundhand or Engrossing Script..."", seeming to indicate that they're the same -- and leaving me even more confused). Please educate me!"

But this should be avoided, as it's also used to refer to half a dozen completely unrelated scripts (including, for example, Foundational).  See the first ~half of this comment for details on the differences between ER and ES. The rest of the thread may also be of interest."

Calligraphy,3dg2y8,yctkfp,3,Thu Jul 16 00:11:29 2015 UTC,"Seconding guidelines. Italic is fine to start with - take a look in the FAQ for some guidance, but here's a tip that should help: the beauty of calligraphy comes (generally) from regularity. In italic, there are shapes that repeat themselves. The n, for example, should look exactly like a u when turned upside-down. That n and u, with a longer stem on them, should become an h and a y.  For example.  a, g, q, and d all share a kind of teardrop shape as well, and b and p basically upend that teardrop shape. If you upend them, your g and b should look basically identical.  So yeah - practice those basic repeating shapes, as well as the other basic strokes for the remaining letters. Italic was a challenge for me, but I pushed through it - you can too.  In regard to your other comment - as you can see, putting guidelines under the paper is totally kosher. You'll want to make sure it doesn't slide as you work, so holding your writing paper on with drafting tape is a good idea. If you have the money and space, a light board will change your life in this regard."
Calligraphy,3dg2y8,MShades,2,Thu Jul 16 04:58:12 2015 UTC,-Use guide lines  -Measure said guidelines according to the script and nib width eg: Quadrata has a 1 nib width in between all vertical strokes (2 in-between words) and 5 nib widths tall for the letter body  -Start with something less organic eg: Blackletter.  *Footnote: I'm no expert

I leave it under, so I have been using guidelines, though I'm not doing anything to space my letters (apologies to /r/keming). Does it look like the alignment is off?  Thanks for the suggestion on Blackletter. It's pretty intricate, so it will be a good exercise for me. I'll be trying it later tonight."
Calligraphy,3dg2y8,ulzo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"I would stick to what you are working on now for a while. You need to get the pen manipulation down before you start the more complicated hands or you will get overwhelmed. You are doing well, keep practicing - letter by letter, stroke by stroke. You don't need to go too fast. Look up videos of people doing the script so you can see what strokes to do, when."

Out of curiosity, how did you do the multiple colors in one lettering? I have a plethora of nibs, ink, and colored pencils... Just haven't been able to figure that one out."
Calligraphy,3ddjkv,70turino351,5,Wed Jul 15 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried this myself, but from what I've read in books and from others here I believe that you basically paint different colors onto the nib, folded pen, etc. Usually, you would remove all of the paint off the nib before moving onto another color. If you leave the first color on and add a second (or third!), the colors will blend together.  *edit: And this is assuming that they used some gouache for the color. I'm not sure you could accomplish this as easily with inks. You literally get a paint brush and paint the nib with whatever colors of paint you want."

Calligraphy,3ddjkv,thundy84,3,Wed Jul 15 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"Guilds exist all over the world, though obviously they have to have sufficient members to warrant their existence; you won't see a guild with less than 20 members or something like that.  Your name contains “Turino” for example—which made me think to look; yes, there is a calligraphy guild in Turin, Italy: Dal Segno alla Scrittura.  If on the other hand you are in a location with no local calligraphic tradition, then you might have a more difficult time finding a formal organization. I know for example of a prominent Greek-Canadian calligrapher who is trying to create a Greek tradition of calligraphy since theirs has long been lost. However most mid-to-South Western European countries have very strong calligraphic traditions—Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain ... and they will all have guilds and societies. One of the most prominent in the western world will be located in England, which is the Society of Scribes & Illuminators. They have some well-known, world-class calligraphers in their ranks of Fellows. Canada follows the British tradition (and so we have many societies here, though mostly in major city centres) and America has many more, especially in population-dense areas such as NYC and California."

Guidelines make everything better, and help maintain a sense of evenness. Check out the generators in the Wiki. Simplify - flourishing and decorating letters is a later stage of development. As a beginner, it's best to keep them simple until you know how the script works. Take a look at examples from the wiki - it looks like you're working towards a blackletter / textura quadrata script, which is great. We have lots of historical samples and good work has been done here with those. Take a look at how those letters are constructed and try to get as close as you can.   Keep posting!"

Calligraphy,3deeyk,butterbeard,3,Thu Jul 16 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"Also, blackletter (a more usual term than ""Old English"" for this style) isn't usually done in all-caps. When you have a big long passage in blackletter, all the lowercase letters form a consistent texture that's occasionally spiced up pleasantly by big capitals, but if you write in all capitals you get a lot of shapes that don't have good cohesion with each other, and look all disjointed and hard to read."

BE: Any straight holder, or make your own. Brause C AKA Bandzug nibs. The two previously mentioned inks, plus designers/artists grade gouache of high permanence, liquid gum arabic."
Calligraphy,3dd721,BestBefore2016,2,Wed Jul 15 11:24:38 2015 UTC,"For broad edge calligraphy, you might also want to try one or two of the larger sizes of Speedball C nibs (C0, C1, or C2). While the Speedball nibs get a lot of hate, that is only really justified (IMHO) for the smaller sizes. They are - depending where you live - much easier to obtain. If you are ordering online, you might also want to pick up some of the mitchell/leonardt roundhand nibs and reservoirs. This way you can try the main styles of broad nibs and see what works for you."
Calligraphy,3dd721,IowaPharm2014,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. For broad edge, I was looking to pick up a set of Brause Bandzug (C) nibs and a set of Mitchell or Leonardt/Hiro nibs. Do you have a preference between the Mitchell or Leonardt nibs? I have read that the Leonardt are in the middle, in terms of flex, between Brause (stiffest) and Mitchell (most flex). Or would you just pick up a set of all and just see what works best? Thanks again!"
Calligraphy,3dd721,IowaPharm2014,2,Sat Jul 18 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"I really like the Brause bandzug nibs. I don't have a preference between Mitchell and Leonardt. I have only tried one size of the Wm. Mitchells because it was the only one for sale locally. The Hiro Leondardt nibs were way too flexible when I was first starting out and are still rather more flexible than I like to use regularly. My hand has gotten lighter and I think with practice that flexibility might be useful for details in a few historical scripts that were traditionally written with a quill.  Whichever brand you end up getting (Mitchell or Leonardt), I would recommend that you get a reservoir for each nib. Be careful with these as they are far too easy to lose. You may or may not use them for some sizes depending on the consistency of your ink."
Calligraphy,3dd721,cheesyfiona,2,Sat Jul 18 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"For pointed pen: Check out the Hourglass oblique from Paper Ink Arts, too. Fits different nibs. I found it hard to use the Leonardt Principals when starting, as I had a heavy hand. If you do, too, try the G's. (Zebra / Tachikawa)"
Calligraphy,3dd721,BestBefore2016,2,Thu Jul 16 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"A heavy hand is one of the reasons beginners should avoid nibs like that. They just reinforce the bad habit. It needs to be done away with asap.  Also, almost all good nibs will fit in a Zanerian flange that's been adjusted for Principals, and the obliqueness of said flange is much better."
Calligraphy,3dd721,cheesyfiona,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"Avoid the G's for the heavy handed? I used to not be able to write anything with more flexible nibs as they dump all the ink as soon as I put pressure. Happy to say though that my hand's muscle memory has improved since that time, and I can use other nibs like the Principal, Blue Pumpkin, Esterbrook 357, etc. Still not the most flex ones, but maybe I'll get there."
Calligraphy,3dd721,BestBefore2016,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"With regard to the Zanerian flange, I have always been under the impression that with most oblique holders, the flange can be adjusted with needle-nose pliers to fit individual nibs? Is that not the case with the ones that John Neal specifies adjusted for particular nib?"
Calligraphy,3dd721,cheesyfiona,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"If you get such an oblique with the classic flange style (like the Zanerian or Century), you will be able to adjust it with needle-nose pliers, but it's not something you can just repeat ad infinitum. The metal gets more fatigued every time, and at some point it will fail. Hence you adjust it to take a certain range of nibs, and keep it that way.  But like I said, it doesn't really matter, since basically all good nibs have a similar thickness and radius of curvature to the Principal."

I personally think it helps because you at least have someone showing you the ropes so that you can practice on your own. You can tell what you're doing wrong and fix those mistakes. The teacher that I took the class from was strict on showing the basics of Copperplate, but she also encouraged us with different variations and finding our own sense of style.

Calligraphy,3d9cuv,pastellist,4,Tue Jul 14 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of calligraphers are women—ask anyone who teaches (or attends) classes. If that makes you feel insecure for some reason, then calligraphy probably isn't for you.  As for motivation—I apologize because I'm sure this is going to come across as sounding negative, but why should it be left up to us to motivate you? Calligraphy isn't something that is learned overnight—it takes years of frequent (e.g. minimum ~1 hour, daily) practice to become a skilled calligrapher. If you can't find the motivation to get yourself started, why should I invest my valuable time in designing a lesson plan for you knowing the odds are that you'll have given up again in less than a week?  I'm far from being qualified to provide a professional opinion, but if you have such trouble getting motivated to see something through, or making decisions for yourself, maybe you should consider seeking help from another profession besides scribes. Just my two cents."
Calligraphy,3d9cuv,aestheticxlies,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood most of my post and honestly your reply is pretty insulting.  1) It's not insecurity. It's an environmental thing. The classes I've seen seem tight knit and I would just not fit in at all.  2) Yes, that's an extremely negative way of looking at it. I'm not ""leaving it up to"" anyone. I'm asking for help. Just like anyone else. I'm not asking you to motivate me. I'm asking (very very clearly) for some kind of stricter starting steps.  3) I never once implied that I intended to learn over night. Everything takes a long time to get good at. This post isn't asking for help trying to get skilled quickly. That was an odd assumption.   If you can't find the motivation to get yourself started, why should I invest my valuable time in designing a lesson plan for you knowing the odds are that you'll have given up again in less than a week?   Not sure what to say to this. Again, I'm asking for help getting started so that I can give myself momentum. I'm trying to find the motivation myself right now with this thread. I never asked for anyone to design a lesson plan as you can see in the second to last paragraph. And yes I have given up before. But (as you could have read) I lose steam when I'm presented with a lot of options. That doesn't happen when I've been into a hobby for a while, so that will not be an issue later on after I've gotten started. Which, again, is all I'm asking for in this thread.   maybe you should consider seeking help from another profession besides scribes   I can't tell if you're asking me to see a therapist or to look into a different hobby."
Calligraphy,3d9cuv,pastellist,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to offend you; merely explaining how I perceive your request; I might have just ignored it wholesale, but instead took the time to reply. You can choose to be insulted by it, or you can seek to understand why I said it. This is the first time I've seen you post here; look through my history and see how long I've been around, and what I've contributed, and decide for yourself if you want to keep reading or slam the door in my face.  If anything about this thread is extremely negative, it's your post, not mine—you might have just asked, “I have some parallel pens and paper but am paralysed by indecision on where to start. Could you give me some clear steps to get me through the first couple weeks?” Making an introduction by way of stating “I need someone to slap me in the face and tell me what to do/I just can not gain any momentum/I end up becoming disinterested and quitting/I have motivation issues” is not the best way to motivate me to want to help you, even if it is disarmingly honest.  To put it in a different context, if these were your opening lines for an job interview to become an apprentice, or as a student applying for an a small but highly desirable course, do you think you would land the coveted spot? People that provide information here are giving their time, experience and skill away for free because we love what we do and want to share it with others—but it would be wrong to assume I give of my valuable time to anyone who seeks help. The ones who work hard, post regularly, and stick with it are the scribes I want to work with, because they have a far better chance of succeeding than the person who—of his own admission—has a habit of becoming disinterested in his hobbies and quitting.  As for seeking help—where, how, and indeed if you choose to do so (or not) is entirely up to you. I'm just not convinced a group of amateur scribes on the internet can provide you with the tools you need to solve your problems.  Best of luck to you."

I don't see how contributions to the sub are relevant here.  You are still misinterpreting things. I said your view was negative, not your post. Your post was almost not relevant because most of what it referenced didn't really have much to do with what I was asking. Take a look at the post I gilded to see exactly what I was asking for. You still seem to think that I was seeking professional help.  As for brevity, yeah maybe I'm long winded. That's what the TL;DR was for. But I felt like if I didn't specify my situation then I might not find what I was looking for. Luckily others understood what I was trying to find and generously provided what they had to offer.  If you only offer help to those who ""work hard, post regularly, and stick with it"" then it seems natural that you would not want to help a person who is new (and can not have posted regularly), and who is seeking something that will help him ""stick with it."" The ""work hard"" part is a negative assumption.  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate that you took the time to post your thoughts and I thank you for that.

Calligraphy,3d28x7,Zombotron,4,Mon Jul 13 09:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm far from being an expert italic calligrapher, but I can suggest being more careful with spacing. Vertical strokes should be uniformly separated like this.  I read here once that calligraphy is music for the eyes. Having a good rhythm is a big part of having your writing look great, even if the letterforms are not perfect."
Calligraphy,3d28x7,rbonvall,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes, my spacing is abysmal. Gotta work a lot on that. I'm a bit overwhelmed by... a bit of everything right now, heh: letterforms, rhythm, spacing, downstrokes... maybe I should use a more complex guideline, with more vertical lines until I have the letterforms and spacing down. Practicing ideas are welcome!"
Calligraphy,3d28x7,Zombotron,4,Mon Jul 13 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not very experienced, but I can see a few things that could be improved.  (Also, I assume that by ""hard"" you mean very nitpicky criticism)   Your slant is mostly uniform except for a few instances. The first l in all, the f in of, and the b in barrie look to be a bit more slanted than the rest.  The i in barrie and the hump of the h in faith look a little too upright compared to the rest. In letters that don't have an ""uplift"" on the downstroke (such as r, h, and n) your stroke ends slightly below the baseline. Your miniscule r is not consistent throughout the quote.  The r in world looks very rounded on the top and is a little thicker in the start of the stroke for the rounded part than the others, the r in trust is a little squished in the rounded part compared to the others, the first r in barrie looks the best I think, the second one looks more like the r in world in terms of curve which makes it look a little different from the r just before it. The negative space in the centers of a and d should all be the same size but they vary a little bit from each other."
Calligraphy,3d28x7,scriBeth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"Many thanks for the tips! By hard I meant it's ok to just tell me ""what the hell are you doing, already on the QOTW when your letterforms are crap!?! Get back to practicing them!"" :)   Right! I must keep on working that slant. So difficult. I must say I got way better in this last month, though! Didn't notice that, you're right! Will keep an eye on that. Absolutely right as well. I'm still trying to settle on a style, I think, since I see many variations on italic calligraphy. But that's no excuse for inconsistent letters. You can't imagine how much I'm struggling with this. No matter how much I practice, I don't get noticeably better. Every single a/b/d comes out different. Worse yet, they're not consistent width-wise, so the whole word/phrase gets ruined. I don't know how to get better results. More practice I guess!"

Calligraphy,3d28x7,lantern53,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I understand now. English is not my first language.  Yes, you're right. I've been following this, which I like, but looks like a stripped down version of italic: http://www.calligraphy-skills.com/italic-lettering.html  I also took a look at the italic alphabets on ""The art of calligraphy"" and ""The calligrapher's bible"", but those somehow are way more difficult to replicate. Plus, some letters look ""wrong"" to me, like in the latter one, the 'h' connecting upstroke stems from below the middle, which according to Lloyd Reynolds and others should not. They just look inconsistent and somehow ugly to my eye.  I'd love to get ""The foundations of calligraphy"" by Sheila Waters, I'm simply blown away by her work and I think she'd be the one I'd like to ""copy"". But it's impossible to get it in Europe. For a reasonable price at least, I don't swim in money. 2nd hand copies go for +500$, which is ridiculous.  TL;DR: I'm basically very lost on what to follow, yes. There seems to be a lot of italic alphabets, each with its quirks (no two 'w' the same, for instance!), and the ones I found on books are somehow trickier, uglier for me to replicate. Could you suggest a proper one so I can stick to it?"

Calligraphy,3d2028,bobby_horne,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:40:11 2015 UTC,"If the nib points in the same direction of the Copperplate slant, you will be creating slanted letters; vertically, it is for writing upright. So, basically it depends if you want to follow a strict slant, or go modern with varying slants, though it is recommended to follow the slants when starting out."
Calligraphy,3czwgc,ctrl2,5,Sun Jul 12 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing that stands out to me right now is the lack of consistency in the spacing. Take a look at the word ""knowledge,"" for example. Three differently-spaced versions of the same word. I think that the second one is the closest to the spacing you should be aiming for. That being said, you have ""power"" three times, and all three are pretty consistent (which is great!). The first ""scientia"" is far too spaced out, while the other two are better. This image is not a great size, but it will give you a good idea of the consistent spacing in this hand.  Your ""a""s are a bit top-heavy. Take a look at this manuscript. Notice the fine tail on the interior of the ""a"" and compare against the diagonal block you have instead. Try using just the left tip of your nib to skate the ink down into that hairline.   I can see that you're struggling with ""s"" also, which can be a really tough one. I love this video by /u/GardenofWelcomeLies of his textura ""s.""   And as general help for black letter, the British Library has digitized A LOT of manuscripts which are amazing to leaf through online and get inspiration from historical texts.  Keep up the practice! It's looking good!"

Calligraphy,3czwgc,SteveHus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:13:29 2015 UTC,"Looks like your pen angle is around 45 degrees. Flatten it much more. The spacing between vertical strokes in a letter should be the thickness of one stroke. The spacing between letters should also be the thickness of one stroke. It looks like you have the basics of the form, now work on these parts. Also, it's better to write out a single letter rather than a whole para or word when learning a new style."

Calligraphy,3czwgc,SteveHus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:07:25 2015 UTC,The pen angle is OK but it looks like the bigger problem is that the letters are too heavy where they shouldn't be—your 's' is enormously thick in the centre but it should only be joined by the faintest of hairlines there. Ditto for the top-heavy 'a'.

Personal notes   I need to work on letter width. I'll probably start actually gridding out the necessary spacing.  Descenders need a lot of practice. I might actually start tracing letters so I learn how to handle the pen. Can't wait to improve basic strokes so I can use a smaller pen, because I'm burning through paper.

Assuming you have pushed it in far enough, and it's still not working, try washing the nib by holding it under running water or dipping it into water.  Wipe dry with a paper towel.  You should see some ink on the paper towel by now.  If not, and if it still doesn't work, take the ink cartridge out. Wash the nibs under running water. (Put the plug in so you don't lose them down the plug hole).  You could put the ink cartridge back in and try writing again at this stage.  If it's still not working, then put the nibs in slightly warm water to soak overnight. Rinse under running water again. Dry with paper towels - give them a bit of a shake to get all the water out. Put the ink cartridge back in. It should write straight away, but the ink will be watered down for the first few words (or more). If the ink doesn't start flowing straight away, hold the pen vertically with the nib touching the paper to allow gravity to get the ink flowing. Don't shake the pen.  I hope that helps."

It said ""calligraphy set from Korea $15"".It was the end of my garage-sailing trip and I was down to my last cash and the woman agreed to $12 as it was all the cash I had left (I think $15 is fair for the box, tbh).  I have a pal who took up calligraphy out of the blue, but he's just taken to it; I thought it would make a cool gift for him. But the longer I looked at the box and it's contents, the more I thought maybe I'd like to learn (so I can keep this pretty thing in my house always ... the selfish side kicking in! D: ) It looks like there's everything one would need to make some calligraphy aside from the paper.  Does anyone happen to know what the writing on the various bits mean?  Would this make a nice gift? Or would it be more like those plastic-y art kits for kids?  Also, my buddy does more of the ""English"" (that's almost certainly not the right term) style of calligraphy .. Would a set like this even be useful?"

Calligraphy,3cyrmm,slumber_doll,2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:21 2015 UTC,"If you're practicing broad-edged calligraphy, getting some french ruled paper can be a huge help. There are some 50 sheet Clairefontaine wirebound notebooks for $5.50 at gouletpens that respond reasonably well to parallel ink. Another (less reliable) option is to look at the paper in your local staples. You can potentially hit the jackpot, but it's a tad risky. If you don't mind drawing your own guidelines and have a sharp eye for deals, you may be able to snag a nice drawing pad that's fairly cheap and grab yourself an Ames lettering guide from Paper & Ink arts for $3.30.   A personal piece of advice- if you ever become rich enough to afford buying Rhodias, they're still not that great. Paper quality is excellent, but I never feel like dots are enough to guide writing. Guidelines are your friend, and most of the common Rhodias (the A4 staplebound) don't really provide them adequately."

Most of the softcover pads of paper are pretty cheap and work with every kind of ink that I have.  Depending on your ink, you may want to buy a ream of ink jet printer paper.

I was quite happy with a straight holder, but thought I should try to learn how to write with an oblique, because that's what everyone does.  I suspect I'd still have the problem with my hands hurting if I have to press too hard (arthritis).  I'd tried a Noodlers Creeper and Ahab before, with very little joy because I can't press down hard enough to get a broad stroke without pain.  I quite like the Zebra G nib, and if I'd been writing with a minimum height of 4 mm instead of 8, this probably would have looked alright.

Calligraphy,3cqead,Qalligraphy,3,Fri Jul 10 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"I managed to misspell the word twice. Without noticing.  My Rotunda is a little rusty, and I'm still learning Carolingian. But I think it looks okay. If anyone can give me any tips on Carolingian, I'd really appreciate it. :-)"
Calligraphy,3cqead,pastellist,5,Fri Jul 10 04:29:08 2015 UTC,"Even though I still don't really feel qualified to dispense advice (I've got some imposter syndrome stuff going on, maybe), I can't seem to stop myself from giving it! I'm turning into a Carolingian Advice Person whether I want to or not.  I want you to know before I launch into this critique that your script is consistent and pleasing, and I like looking at it. Please don't take this criticism harshly; you're really doing very well.    What exemplar are you studying? I have only really studied the Moutier-Grandval Bible, so I'm basing the following criticism based on my knowledge of that manuscript. If you're studying something else, feel free to ignore when needed!  Try slanting your letters a little bit. Carolingian tends to lean forward at a slight angle -- 5 degrees or so -- but your letters are very upright. The clubbed ascenders pull on the letterforms, so if you don't slant the letters forward, they feel like they're being pulled backward by the weight on that stroke. The execution of the clubs on your ascenders is good, and would look even better with a slight slant. (Don't forget about the letter b! :P) It looks like your x-height is a little too big, which makes your letters not compressed enough. E.g., the o forms are too round, and don't have that characteristic squashed lemon shape in the middle.  The ascenders/descenders are too short. One of the characteristics of Carolingian is that the ascenders and descenders are taller than the x-height.   Try an x-height of three nib widths or so, maybe a little less, and an ascender height of 4.5. When I first started, my x-height, ascenders, and descenders were all 4 nib widths; when I changed the x-height to 3 and the ascenders to 4.5, it made an enormous difference. To illustrate: here's page 8 of The Lord of the Rings project, right before the switch; and here's page 9, right after I changed the proportions. (My descenders are 4-ish nib widths -- a little less than the ascenders in order to avoid conflicts with the next line of text.) The energy of the script changes dramatically. Regarding your o form -- I think some of your Rotunda experience is creeping in! The first stroke of your first e is probably your most successful o shape. The bottom of the letter L should echo the first stroke of the o; this letter often butts into the following letter. Your letter L terminates very quickly. Let your e, g, and r off the leash a little bit -- those end strokes often butt into the next letter. Let them dance a little. The branching strokes of your m are nicely done. In the Moutier-Grandval Bible, the arch strokes of the h curves in, as it does with Uncial. But what you do with it is really a matter of personal preference. I like the way that curve looks so much that I use it in the m and n as well, even though it was very uncommon to see that in the MGB.     There are two pieces of excellent advice that helped me tremendously:  One (I think from /u/GardenOfWelcomeLies): Begin your practice by critiquing the previous day's work. Compare every letter to your exemplar, note what's not looking quite right, and make some practice strokes to correct it before launching into your practice for the day.  Two: I'm going to quote /u/cawmanuscript here, who gave the following advice about Carolingian specifically:    Once you understand the important characteristics of the script; then try not to worry about ""correct"", as the script has played an incredibly long-lived role in western lettering. Finding correct is next to impossible.  The script is a flowing, cursive style with fluidity and movement, almost as if the scribes enjoyed writing it. I have studied Carolingian under several world class teachers who encouraged me to ""own' the hand and let it write. Yours is still too constructed, so although I don't want to make any comments on a technical level; I do want to encourage you to not be too fixed on examplars and others comments. That doesn't mean to stop looking at your work but in a less critical way.    Hearing that my hand was too constructed was incredibly helpful for some reason -- don't know why, but that piece of advice just clicked. From that point on, I worked to own the letterforms and to develop an energetic rhythm to my writing.  Hope this helps!"
Calligraphy,3cqead,Qalligraphy,2,Fri Jul 10 23:36:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to thank you for such a detailed critique. All of this will definitely help me out over the next few weeks :)  In regards to exemplars, I'm using Julien Chazal's Calligraphy: A Complete Guide as a reference. I know his work isn't super consistent, but it's a good start.   Try slanting your letters a little bit. Carolingian tends to lean forward at a slight angle -- 5 degrees or so -- but your letters are very upright. The clubbed ascenders pull on the letterforms, so if you don't slant the letters forward, they feel like they're being pulled backward by the weight on that stroke.   Thanks, I knew something was a little bit off, but I couldn't put my finger on it.   Try an x-height of three nib widths or so, maybe a little less, and an ascender height of 4.5. When I first started, my x-height, ascenders, and descenders were all 4 nib widths; when I changed the x-height to 3 and the ascenders to 4.5, it made an enormous difference.   I always manage to screw up the correct proportions. I tried to eyeball it because I'm lazy, but yours seems to look better than what I've been doing.  You're also right about the ""o""s. All of them end up looking like a generic ""o"" or a Rotunda-ish ""o"" no matter what.   In the Moutier-Grandval Bible, the arch strokes of the h curves in, as it does with Uncial. But what you do with it is really a matter of personal preference. I like the way that curve looks so much that I use it in the m and n as well, even though it was very uncommon to see that in the MGB.   The exemplar I'm referring to has two forms of ""h"", one of which being the one you described. I chose the other one just to see how it would look. Honestly, I don't like it as much as the one you suggested."

It depends on what your definition of ""really good"" is. For most people posting frequently on this subreddit, the answer to that is verrrrry different from the people who see some haphazard modern pointed pen script inked in marker on Pinterest and call it calligraphy.   That aside, though, I've always felt it insulting when people (especially friends) seem to forget about all the training you've put into your field of expertise when they ask for you to do it for free/way too cheap. It seems to happen more in artistic endeavors than business, too; maybe because people feel some shame in asking an accountant to do their business taxes for free. But designing a logo?

This is how it usually looks. The copies below them i wrote much more slowly. The last capitalization line i wrote very slowly.  I just think my writing overall is just very inconsistent. Frequently having random letters floating above the line or sinking into it when it shouldn't be. Very inconsistent spacing in between the lettering, which became very apparent when i tried writing the same phrase more slowly as you can see in the picture. Very bad symmetry and balance from one side of the letter to the other (for example: you can clearly see one side of the ""M"" is higher than the other). Also i feel the sizing of the letters are not proportional to the size of the letters next to it, giving it a sloppy appearance.  Should i just scrap it completely and start practicing a different font?  Thanks for the help."
Calligraphy,3cni2l,rexbovum,5,Thu Jul 9 08:33:33 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, /r/handwriting is the real home of this post, so you might try x-posting there. There's also a handful of videos on /r/handwritingrepair that seem like they might be useful.  That said, since I did open up this can of worms here, I'll try to give a proper response (that and /r/handwriting seems a little circle-jerky, but that's neither here nor there).  First off, your handwriting (the meat and bones of it) looks alright to me. It really isn't much different from what you see on /r/handwriting posts. As /u/MShades has pointed out, consistency in form and height of your letters is going to make the biggest difference to your writing.  http://i.imgur.com/EutuuwA.jpg - here, I've re-interpreted your handwriting style (both the lowercase/uppercase and all-caps) with more care to keeping consistency. That one change alone radicalizes it in terms of readability/neatness. From that point onwards, it's really your personal preference what you want your letters to look like (style, or as you put it ""font"").  Side note: I took the liberty of looking at your post history, and saw you didn't have much success with your question to AskReddit - that's because ""font"" refers to computer font (typography), not handwriting. Styles of writing in calligraphy would be called ""scripts"", and your own personal interpretation of said scripts is your ""hand"".   Expounding on the tips: writing using the whole height of the lined paper will help you keep track of whether your letters are consistent in height or not. You can go from wide-ruled to college-ruled and then to printing your own lined paper as you start ""miniaturizing"" into real-life usability. Secondly, practicing one letter at a time (e.g., ""today I'm going to focus on getting my 'a' down pat"") helps you build consistency of look, and zones you into any glaring issues preventing you from being consistent. For example, I can't for the life of me do your lowercase d's well, so if I was practicing it, I would notice that that way of writing d's is sub-optimal (for me) and see if it there weren't any better ways of going about it. It's all about playing around and experimenting!  Lastly, you might want to consider going to a slant rather than writing upright. Writing upright, when you start deviating to the left and to the right, I think it looks more obvious than when you write at an angle. Also, writing at an angle really helps with keeping a certain ""rhythm"" in writing, as beautifully demonstrated by /u/lantern53 in some of his recent posts here. YMMV.  Finally, to keep things relevant to this subreddit, the study of calligraphy itself has much to lend to your handwriting. Personal example - http://i.imgur.com/Aa2T5ia.jpg.   Good luck!"

Calligraphy,3cgi17,dflintastic,8,Tue Jul 7 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"Welcome! A couple small things. One is that I notice you have a fountain pen in the picture, too, and I suspect you used it to draw the hairline verticals. Your square nib can actually do this really well, and with a lot of the black letter scripts, it is important you learn how to manipulate it to make different shapes like serifs and hairlines. Try practicing all with your dip pen. It's a lot more versatile than you might think!  Also, if you're interested in black letter scripts, then dig into some historical exemplars like manuscripts. It's a great place to study the uniformity of the letters, the repetition, and the strict structure the script is under. With that, look at historical and modern takes on black letter flourishing. It's a lot more than just adding tails onto letters (which is totally what I thought when I started!). An image like this is a great example of how intricate the flourishing can get, but how to some extent, it follows a formula.   Keep practicing and posting!"

Calligraphy,3cibw8,Pantogriff,3,Thu Jul 9 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Can't help with a book, but have you tried any of the translucent papers sold as ""vellum"" in art/craft/scrapbooking type shops?  Also tracing paper or drafting paper might suit.  You might be able to find these papers under names such as Butter Paper or Glassine Paper.  There is also Detail Paper, which is 50 gsm. Depending on the brand, sometimes you can get lucky with the cheapest pads of unlined paper sold at office supply stores (very white, nice and crisp, very thin, doesn't feather).  I guess this is basically the same as airmail lined writing pads.  If you're not actually after thin paper, just wanting smoothness, then Fuji Xerox Colotech Idol 100 gsm copier paper is very nice.  I haven't tried their 120 gsm papers, but they come in gloss and silky matt.  I've found the Fuji Xerox papers to be better than the HP ones.  As far as I can tell, there used to be more types of paper available 30+ years ago.  I used to use Croxley Onion Skin Air Mail paper, but it hasn't been manufactured for over 10 years.  I also had some other similar papers (very thin, almost transparent, with a watermark) that I inherited from grandparents.  I can't find anything like that anymore."

I've tried several (3) different forms of vellum and they all have very different properties, ranging from heavy/smooth/non absorbing to rough/bleeding. FWIW, I'd love to try out real velum at some stage because that looks ideal to me.  I'll check out the Detail paper, which from online images looks similar to some Bienfang paper I recently bought. I like the Bienfang for its crisp surface but it's ultra thin, so not ideal for writing.  I'll definitely check out your suggestion of Xerox Colotech paper because I do like writing on heavy paper. From images on the web it looks like some wrapping paper they use in some local cheese shop and which is wonderful to write on: heavy and very smooth.

First of all, you should try and slope your letters a bit to the right. The opinions about the sloping angle are divided but a constant slope of 5--10 degrees makes the writing prettier.  For your s, don't use the normal 45 degree pen-angle but a more moderate 30 degree-ish angle. Try the difference and you'll notice the 30-degree angle produces a more gracious, less heavy, letter.  The letter o is difficult. I struggle with it every day. All I can say is practice, practice, and practice.  Besides that, looks like you enjoy writing and you're on the right track. When writing, try to criticise your own work. E.g. are all os perfect/are they the same? If not, try if you can see what causes the difference, imagine your perfect o and use that image the next time you're writing an o.

Calligraphy,3cgx49,stutalon,3,Tue Jul 7 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I can help give you some of the backstory.  I haven't used the Horizon pens sold by PIA but I believe they are modelled on the old Powell pens from the early 80's.  They were handmade by a man called Powell in the US.  About 10 years ago, I was given a complete set (5 pens) of Powells from a local calligrapher who was retiring.  They were amazing to use and I loved using them but didn't realize what I had until Julian Waters saw me using them at a workshop.  He told me the story of the Powells.  I still them a lot and expect I will pass them on to another calligrapher when I can't do this anymore.  If the Horizon pens approach them in quality then they would be worth the money.   I use automatic pens a lot as well, have great success with them but they will only last for a few years. I got about 5 years out of my 1 inch auto before I had to replace it.  At $10 a go, I can accept that for a good tool  I will probably try the Horizon pens in the next year or so.  If you do get them please give us a report."
Calligraphy,3cgx49,cawmanuscript,2,Tue Jul 7 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"No experience with both.  I've used automatic pens a lot and I love writing with them. For some reason I like the stiffness and the fact that it's easy to switch from wide to narrow side. However, recently I started writing with more flexible nibs (especially Speedball C nibs), which are much more flexible. (When I started I simply couldn't write with the Speedball nibs.) The Speedball writing is much more crisp.  It's difficult to control the ink flow with the automatic pens. I always put a little sponge inside the nib to slow down the ink flow and to make writing last a bit longer. I usually use these cleaning sponges because they have the right thickness and you just cut off a bit. One sheet of cleaning sponge will last a long time."
Calligraphy,3cgx49,dongen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:45:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info - I may get 1 of each to start and see which I like before buying a full set though the Horizon brass did seem a bit more well crafted.

Calligraphy,3cj1er,zackafshar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Love new faces in here. So I hate when I post something asking for advice and get none, especially when I was starting out, so I'll do my best while on my phone :)  First off, I love the concept! The fact that you're already thinking about the relationship between words and their visual representation is dope. However, the most important part of calligraphy and most design is that your dope idea is easily recognized. Because this idea has a lot to do with the words themselves, its important for them to be legible. So we know you have a strong set of ideas behind you, now we can focus on that.  First, I would recommend some sort of guides, whether a baseline, x line, or whatever else. They're invaluable when starting out, especially using miniscules. Next, definitely take a look at some alphabets in books, or online. There are some great examples in our wiki. Pay close attention to proportions and tendencies of traditional forms. Once you've learned and gotten a grasp on the basics, you can add your own flair, but its tough to do so beforehand.   Again, awesome idea! I'd love to see the execution and craftsmanship do it justice :) Write on, brotha! Hope this helped."

Calligraphy,3ccgpt,SteveHus,2,Mon Jul 6 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"Different person chiming in here:  I can't find an exact example of diagonal guidelines, but look at the ""upright slanted"" example at the bottom of this page: http://www.calligraphy-skills.com/italic-lettering.html  You want to keep the angle constant. If it's  upright, you don't want to slowly start slanting at the end of the line. If you're writing slanted, you don't want the angle of the slant (dotted line) to change.  Imagine if you had that dotted line as a guideline throughout the line to help you keep the angle straight. (for upright, this can be a vertical line, although it's easier to do upright without vertical guidelines).   For the guideline comment, look at your last m. The bottoms of your strikes aren't following the guideline or each other, they're all different.   One of my own comments, the top serif (little tail) of all of those letters, most notably of your first ""i"", is too long. You seem to have moved your pen one full nib width to the right before moving vertically down; half a bit width or so is more than enough for it to look life. Practice the stroke of the ""i"" alone until you can do it nicely without thinking (this is a good practice technique for every stroke, and then every letter, as you're learning a new script)."

I've noticed that while my pull-strokes can be kept pretty smooth and controlled, my upstrokes result in slightly jittery lines (also the movement feels super scratchy).  By jittery I mean it looks like a speaker with a lot of bass was playing under my worktable when I was drawing the line.  Any tips for this?  Do I need to apply more pressure (I'm applying as little as possible) or alter my pen angle?  I'm using the Leonardt Blue Pumpkin on Rhodia paper.

Calligraphy,3ccxs0,callingshotgun,3,Tue Jul 7 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"This video is great for going over all sorts of common beginner's problems. If you're scratching a lot on the upstroke, it could have to do with the angle of your pen being too steep. Upstroke hairlines are tough to master (I'm still nowhere close), and a lot of the smoothness results from repetition, confidence in the stroke (not doing it too slowly helps), and the correct pressure (typically very light). But making sure your basics are good (like the angle of your pen) is very important to start.

Calligraphy,3ccxs0,callingshotgun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"Using a straight holder is likely part of your problem. They all just have the nib jutting straight out—parallel to the main axis of the holder body—so the nib meets the paper at too high an angle. Of course, there are other issues with straight holders too. For left handers, I recommend using a left-oblique, AKA a left handed oblique (an oblique with its flange out to the right).  Also the blue pumpkins are quite dull nibs, so it's likely damaged and/or you're applying too much pressure. For a variety of reasons, I second a move to fine pointed flexible nibs (of those that are reliable and modern, the Leonardt Principal is the best), though it won't help you with this particular problem."

If you want to restore the contents of the pages themselves that is certainly within your purview. I believe you have the lettering skill to do it successfully.  However, I recommend doing some reading and experimenting with some offcuts of vellum before addressing the original document as you have limited experience with calfskin, which is a very different beast compared to paper. You want to be familiar with it before putting your pen to an irreplaceable historical document such as this.   William Cowley sells offcuts as well, but they don't sell nor price any of their products online, you'll have to call or email them—but I expect the shipping and timing coming from England will probably not appeal as much to you as from Pergamena in New York."

Calligraphy,3c98hf,cicciona,6,Mon Jul 6 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"Looks great, Tasha.  The one on the right is closer to the desirable weight; the Bâtarde scripts I've studied seem to be between 3-4 pen widths tall. Ascenders and descenders are a little more restrained than what is done here and the letters could be a little closer together. Note that biting of bows is quite common in Bâtarde where two bowed letters meet, so take the opportunity to take advantage of a few of those where it seems fit. Also note that some letters such as the v only use their flourished form when they start a word -- not in the middle.  I have personally found that one of the greatest challenges of Bâtarde is getting the rhythm right when there are so many different curves in play ... I've found thinking about Italic a bit as I work can help, but getting those curves right is challenging. This is a piece I did a month or two ago for a piece exchange ... Not particularly impressive, I know, but I am most proud of the rubrication at the bottom, which I think you saw on IG a little while ago. The shine of the tempera to the letters is all but lost in the scanning process ... Looks nice in person, though. This one is a bit more recent and uses more generous interlinear spacing as well as showing a bit more consistency/comfort with the letters, I think, as I still practice it a little every now and then.  As with other scripts, there are some distinct advantages to working with the slippery vegetable parchment for Bâtarde—namely that it makes the pen manipulation much easier. The down side is that it's much more difficult to control the pen as it has a tendency to skate away from you. If you haven't tried it though, you might find it to be an interesting exercise compared to paper."
Calligraphy,3c98hf,GardenOfWelcomeLies,2,Mon Jul 6 03:43:13 2015 UTC,"I was hoping you'd impart your expertise on this, Kevin. Thank you. :) And that's a beautiful piece; I do love your Bâtarde hand.   I'm using David Harris' book as a jumpoff point, and it doesn't really provide much else besides the ductus. I'm starting to read that book you wanted a review about, the ""Introduction to Manuscript Studies"" by Clemens and Graham and it's immensely helpful regarding context and use of ligatures. They make the analysis of  the hand so I don't have to (although I will do that anyway).  It's been a challenge to do the different curves and twists, the script is...cramped. But the end result is amazing if done right. I'm going to try using parchment for this, so far I've been using some random sketch paper.   By the way, where can I get the Majuscules for this? I haven't found any, and from what I've read so far, it uses other Gothic scripts' (apart from the versals)."
Calligraphy,3c98hf,GardenOfWelcomeLies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Good questions.  I would say David Harris' interpretation is flawed for the same reason as the other Gothic scripts he covers—which is that he tends to cherry-pick letters, and he uses “single” letters for his exemplars—so for example you see the hairline tails on 'c' and 't', but he doesn't explain that those are only ever used at the end of a word. You see how this is also the case with the opening 'v'—you can surely see how spacing is a problem if you use the flourished 'v' in the middle of a word.  That being said, it's certainly not all bad—but as with most of the book, I would spend more time looking at the examples on the previous page than his ductus.  I would also take the ductus for the f/ſ with a grain of salt (from wherever you read it)—for example, David's ductus suggests going down the left and up the right, while Claude Mediavilla (in his book ""Calligraphy"") suggests going down the right and up the left—and Stan Knight says “The heavy f and long s (ſ) are apparently the result of pen pressure”... So none of them agree!   My suggestion to you is to try each out for yourself and find what works for you—I personally find that pen pressure produces the most accurate and pleasing effect, and is also the least likely to pick up and drag fibres with the nib of the pen on the second stroke (whatever direction you make it in—I personally find two strokes downward works just fine). You will also want to experiment with speed—you will probably find it is easier to create a straight stroke during pen manipulation at speed as compared to moving very slowly.  The best majuscules I know of for Bâtarde—and indeed, the ones I used in the Magna Carta piece—are from the excellent Champfleury by Geoffroy Tory in the early 16th century. If pen manipulation is a challenge for you, though ... these may need to wait until you're a little more comfortable with it. You will also want to update the letters slightly to suit the modern reader."

Calligraphy,3c61lk,fish_n_cake,2,Sun Jul 5 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of my first post on this sub. It's very amateurish but you're showing some strong foundations on layout and script mixing.  One thing you have to consider is that your photo is a mix of calligraphy (where you write) and lettering, which is another art altogether. If you haven't already I'd recommend checking out /r/lettering. Lettering involves ""drawing"" letters rather than writing them, which means you can get really cool layouts (like yours with the banner) since you have the opportunity to draw, erase and modify small stuff. Calligraphy is a lot more of a one-shot thing : you write with ink that you can't erase once it's on paper.  Can I ask what tools you've used for this ? The Gothic part at the bottom looks like a felt tip marker. These are absolutely awful and no one would recommend them, but I started out with these and still use them from time to time, because they do get the job done in the end. One thing you have to watch out for, though, is the x-height. Placing your pen vertically, you can draw a small ""staircase"" that will tell you just how big your letters need to be. It looks like this : https://calligraphypen.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/step06.jpg?w=500&h=159 . Your letters look way too tall for Gothic : you should only draw 4 to 5 nib heights (stairs) for a normal letter (x-height) and 2 to 3 more nib heights for the ascenders (the k in cake).  Another thing you have to acquire is perfectionism. I know you probably didn't mean for this doodle to take 5 hours, but calligraphy is a bitch that way : it demands constant perfectionism. So when adding flourishes like the diamonds and arcs surrounding the ""N"", you want to get your ruler out and make sure they're absolutely symmetrical.  Overall, it's a terrible piece, but everyone's started that way. Not to brag but here's my first piece on this sub and here's a recent piece from 2 years later. Yours is a strong start and I hope to see more from you quite soon !"
Calligraphy,3c61lk,OldTimeGentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"Dude, thanks for taking the time to post this. For tools, it's actually just a Prismacolor brush marker, which probably isn't the best tool for the job. and yeah, you will be seeing more soon."
Calligraphy,3c61lk,OldTimeGentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"It depends what style of calligraphy you wanna do. Never tried the prismacolors but cheap brush pen usually do the job for brush pen calligraphy, which is what your ""fish"" is. But for Gothic (N Cake) calligraphy you will need a broad nib. The tip looks like that : http://www.copicmarker.co.uk/manga/images/faq6.jpg so you can get the broad strokes of Gothic.  If you want super cheap markers to start with I can't recommend the Pilot Lettering Pen for Calligraphy enough. If you get the size 30 (3 mm) you'll have the shittiest most useful piece of garbage you can start calligraphy with. You can usually find them at any art store, and sometimes at normal stationery stores. The ink will last forever and when it dries, I use the tip as a brush to get the dry brush effect you can see in my Star Wars piece. Great for beginners."

Calligraphy,3c4dnu,PointAndClick,2,Sun Jul 5 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"The most common mistake is that people try to put too much ink in/on their nib. Dip in the ink until you can't see the breatherhole anymore,  wipe along the edge of  the inkwell. There should be a thin film over the nib, no drops forming.    The ink itslf should be fine, try not to make it too watery. And if there is no gum arabic in those crystals (I dunno, I think there is already), add some gum. Or honey is a nice cheap alternative, just to get the consistency a bit thicker than water.  Canson paper is good in general and beats printer paper by a mile. The printer paper will bleed, buckle, dry badly and cause other problems. But yeh you can write on printer paper, save up for better paper in the future though ;)"

Calligraphy,3bvzlq,rexbovum,3,Thu Jul 2 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"/u/TMarizzle has the right idea—paper cockles (the buckling you have experienced) when wet. The heavier the paper, the less noticeable this phenomenon. Other substrates like vellum and vegetable parchment experience this effect by several orders of magnitude greater than paper.  You can always use the back tip of a paintbrush to flatten the paper right where you're writing, but if you want to keep the paper itself flat as a finished piece (as opposed to while you are writing) you will have to go with heavier paper. The wetter your work, the heavier your paper needs to be to avoid cockling. You can also try flattening the paper after the fact as you would do for a watercolour painting (e.g. by misting the back of the paper then sandwiching under weight to dry) but only if you wrote on one side, obviously."
Calligraphy,3bvzlq,GardenOfWelcomeLies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:51:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this!   Follow-up question: I've heard that vellum and vegetable parchment are used quite a bit in finished pieces --- how do you flatten them, if the cockling is much, much worse? Does the misting technique work here?  I've also run across dry-mounting with silicone paper for traditional Chinese brush paintings (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reZcWk5kQWM). Has anyone tried this for their own work?"
Calligraphy,3bvzlq,GardenOfWelcomeLies,2,Thu Jul 2 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"With vellum/vegetable parchment you work specifically to avoid this problem—for example, you don't paint watercolour-style paintings on this kind of media. Paintings are done with very short, small strokes that dry quickly to minimize cockling.  As for what happens naturally from the lettering? You live with it. It's a defining characteristic of the tool. If it's not something you want or can live with, use paper or a wood board or something. Vegetable parchment and especially vellum are so sensitive to moisture that just ambient moisture in the air affects them—that is why old manuscripts often had locking covers. It wasn't to prevent others from reading the book; it was to clamp the pages tight to prevent warping from humidity."

If all goes well, I'll post small samples from each sheet when I'm done, and you'll all be able to watch my fundamentals degrade as the x-height shrinks. Actually, it's already started—I do better work at 7+mm. Btw, the names are just a random choice of practice material from a series I've been rewatching recently (with honourifics just to fill space at the end of lines).  Written with a Principal, a Gillott 303 that wasn't as good a specimen as it looked, faux walnut ink, and Walker's iron gall ink.  Given the length (I wasn't really keeping track, but this sheet represents something like 5–8 hours of work), I'm very pleased with the lack of ruinous errors. Of course, there are still several big ones:   Most terminating hairlines from lower loops were bad. Many loops in general were bad, but only a couple are properly bad, and a significant proportion are actually close to what I'm aiming for. The 'H's in 'Hitagi' and 'Hanekawa' (only somewhat made up for by the other 'H'). The 'M' in 'Mayoi' (I guess it's not that bad, but it wasn't the form I was aiming for). Neither of the 'O's are what I was going for. The 'Y' in 'Yotsugi' (the left side is wayy too low for an unlooped form). The hairline on the right side of the 'D' is bad, as always. I'll get this one day... Most 'K's had the shades on the right side out of proportion. 'G' and 'I' on the last line are not strictly terrible, but it's pretty clear I hadn't practiced either recently. Etc.   I have to say, though, I'm quite happy with the way my 'T's and 'A's have been going recently."

Calligraphy,3bqjge,1337_Mrs_Roberts,3,Wed Jul 1 09:53:33 2015 UTC,"I've done a little practice with quills and written a little photojournal on my experience with curing and cutting them, but I am far from being an expert, so take with a grain of salt.  As /u/pinatasenpai says, capillary action is the main force that feeds the nib of the pen. Your pen won't work well without a slit to feed the writing edge. This should be ""cracked""—not cut—into the pen as one of the earliest cutting steps, only after cutting the end off and chopping the bottom half of the quill off (e.g. do it before you form the shoulders). If you can't ""crack"" the pen with the knife, it isn't properly cured and probably won't write well.  A raised backboard isn't going to help any more for a quill than it will for any other kind of pen, to be honest. If it's really dumping ink then I would look elsewhere to solve the problem.  The thickness of ink can play a more pivotal role with quills, in my experience. You really want to use ink that you have complete control over, especially as it related to the consistency. There is a good reason reason Donald Jackson (whom you may know as the head calligrapher for the Saint John's bible) favours stick inks as we works with a quill pen; if you've ever watched him work, he also frequently uses tempera as a binder because it is incredibly sticky so clings well to the pen—which means being able to load a little more ink on the pen than something very thin and runny.  As for how much you should be able to write with a quill pen—unless you are working with a very broad nib or otherwise extreme scale , only getting one letter or two per pen fill means you're doing something wrong. Donald Jackson writing with quill, no reservoir—this is using vermilion stick ink bound with egg tempera.  If you're having trouble cutting a quill, you should read Donald Jackson's chapter on the subject in “The Calligrapher's Handbook” edited by Heather Child, and if you need to practice larger use reeds (Phragmites Australis) as the technique is the same, but is several scales larger, doesn't require curing nor a special knife (a box cutter will work) and reeds can be found for free at the side of the road in many parts of the world."
Calligraphy,3bqjge,GardenOfWelcomeLies,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"I wonder if my use of a writing slope has been covering for some other issues in my writing habits ...  I've found that with dip pens, or the times I've tried quills, that when writing on a horizontal surface the ink falls out of the nib, blobbing the paper, but when on the 45o it doesn't.  Food for thought, I think.  I did consider writing something about ink viscosity, but ended up dropping that paragraph.  I've done a little bit of experimenting with gum arabic (thickener) and ox gall (wetting agent) but not enough to have any true data or opinions.

How much ink do your quills store?  Without a reservoir of some kind, the cut will only hold enough ink for a couple of letters, which seems to be what you're experiencing.  Even just a curved piece of quill resting against the underside of the nib will help the quill hold a lot more ink.  I've found writing on a 45o slope makes writing with dip pens of all varieties much easier.  The pen is then slightly above horizontal, which means the ink flow is then purely capillary, and not gravity fed.  That's really useful if there is too much ink in the pen, or if the ink is too thin."
Calligraphy,3bqjge,pinatasenpai,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"I would get a pre-cut quill so that there is no question that it is made correctly. Ink on a quill has to be pretty liquid so that it flows. If you are using gouache, make sure it is just as thin as when using it with a metal nib."
Calligraphy,3bomzt,MoistToilet,7,Tue Jun 30 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"Nice start!  Guidelines though, see our wiki for guidelines.  They're invaluable!"
Calligraphy,3bomzt,unl33t,4,Wed Jul 1 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"I second that! I'm far from an expert myself but the biggest problem I can see here is that you need to make sure your letters are all a consistent height. Guidelines are tedious but it makes a massive difference, and helps with proportion and spacing etc. Otherwise, it's a really good attempt. You're definitely off in the right direction, just tidy up a few things and you could be really good!"

Calligraphy,3blwxg,lantern53,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:54:05 2015 UTC,It makes me so sad that this is a dying art form.   I think back to when writing was an actual artform that was taken seriously and taught in school. Not like now where if you can make it legible it is fine. It is mostly an afterthought now.  I just can't understand how people don't find this beautiful.
Calligraphy,3blqe7,beyondshodo,7,Tue Jun 30 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"The question is almost impossible to answer because there are very few “distinct” examples of scripts; unlike typefaces, scripts evolved over time and geography, and variances are usually detectable even in a single work since many manuscripts required the efforts of more than one scribe.  Moreover, paleographers disagree on a great many things; names and distinctions between variants of scripts are chief among them. One paleographer might say there are only ~9 between antiquity and the 1600s (which is a frequently-seen cutoff date because it effectively saw the end of the manuscript due to the advent of the printing press) while another might proclaim that the number is somewhere in the 50's.  If you want to understand about the different styles of historical calligraphy, I would look to Michelle P. Brown's “A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600”—it identifies approximately 54 or scripts fitting within 9 major periods or classes of scripts. This list certainly includes rather a lot of scripts that might not be considered “calligraphic” by today's standards, such as New Roman cursive or Merovingian chancery—but they all have their place. The Roman scripts are especially important, as they evolved into what we recognize today as Uncial and half-Uncial scripts.  As was already pointed out, the one class that is almost universally excluded from paleographic study are the pointed pen scripts, which again will vary in number depending on who you ask—but the smallest number is probably around “3” while the largest may be 2-3x that many; I don't know enough about it to suggest where to look for answers.  Hopefully that gives you something to run with."

Calligraphy,3blqe7,cawmanuscript,6,Wed Jul 1 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting question. As /u/BestBefore2016 suggests look for scripts not fonts.  The term calligraphy is misleading as well.  It is a relatively modern term dating from the early 17th century.  Within a lot of professional circles the terms lettering, writing and calligraphy are used almost interchangeably and denoted by context.  Two good overviews of the history of western Calligraphy are Ewan Clayton The Golden THread and Claude Mediavilla Calligraphy.    The term ""The Golden Thread"" is more descriptive of the development of western lettering.  No script started and stopped at a given point in time.  It has been continually developing since the Proto-Sinaitic symbols to today.  There are major groupings of scripts which might be a good place for you to start a study.  You could describe these as styles however there are infinite number of variations within each group as lettering is vary individual. The average person can recognize the letterforms from the major periods, beginning with the Classical Roman of over 2000 years ago.  A trained Calligrapher should be able to trace letters through this lettering history of the Golden Thread.  They may not be proficient at all scripts or have chosen to specialize, however they should be familiar with them.  A course on the Golden Thread has been taught by Sheila Waters for almost 10 years now and some believe that Ewan got the title from her.  The history of western calligraphy is a fascinating study as it is still being written and influenced by contemporary life as it has always been.  Good luck with your study and feel free to ask questions.   /u/GardenofWelcomeLies details some excellent factors which must be considered when studying western calligraphy.  A good overview of the American part of this history is Tamara Thornton Handwriting in America although both Clayton and Mediavilla also cover the subject although as more of an overview.

Calligraphy,3bke55,USH008,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:53:05 2015 UTC,"Understandable.  Think about it this way though; in calligraphy, we are drawing the letters rather than writing them.

Maybe even consider placing the paper upside down?"
Calligraphy,3bke55,funkalismo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:08:05 2015 UTC,"Fellow lefty reporting in. This book has helped me out a good deal in learning hand/arm positioning as well as holding the pen correctly. It also has a handful of scripts you can practice. There are a few videos out on Youtube to watch as well. A ""left handed calligraphy"" search pulls up a lot of tutorials and simple videos of lefties doing calligraphy, like this one. I've watched it quite a few times. Watch how she holds the pen and positions her body. Of course, everyone has their own way of doing things so you'll pick up what works best for you.  The video /u/funkalismo mentioned is another excellent video. The first half of the video is him describing his tools and some of the things he's created. The second half shows him doing his calligraphy. You don't get the full picture of how he positions his body, but you can easily see how he turns the paper and positions his hand.  As for myself, I'm still trying to figure out what works best for me. I switch back and forth from a ""hook"" position to writing under the line. I find turning the paper almost completely sideways helps me more in pointed pen scripts, while using a hook position is fine for broad-edge sometimes. You can also even try writing the letters upside down or simply write the letters ""backwards"" (i.e. going from bottom to top). I find it helps me out to think of it as more drawing the letter instead of writing. And of course, as with anything else: practice, practice, practice."

My left hand is still much better at writing with something like a ball point pen or marker, but my right has been catching up quicker than I was expecting. I still use my left hand for writing with pointed tips, so I have the added benefit of only needing a straight holder - I just change hands rather than using an oblique."

Tube ones are definitely stronger and allow more shading. I wish I had known this before I bought pans. But I have a student-level Cotmann set, and it does the job well enough.  how many colors? You really only need a basic set of maximum 8. Most colors you want to mix. Perhaps find an online watercolor book with an introduction? They tend to list the most important ones.  brushes? oh god there's so many. All you need is a large flat one to do washes, a small ~size 10 for details, and perhaps a size 12 or so for filling in other areas. I also have a lovely round 20 that I like using.    In the case you don't want to paint watercolor, I think you should do it anyway. It's a lot of fun! And people say it's the most difficult type of painting to learn, but I feel its so rewarding.

There is also Business Handwriting and the Palmer Method but these are more basic forms of cursive opposed to Spencerian and they aren't written with any shades.   If you are talking about dip pens, then your world has grown infinitely compared to FPs. You have Copperplate, English Roundhand, Engrossers, Spencerian, and Ornamental Penmanship. I'm sure there are other scripts you can do with pointed pen but I can't really think of any others. You have a plethora of different nibs and all vary and have their own characteristics (see /u/terribleatkaraoke 's recent submission of comparisons of nibs).  Dip pens > FPs, for spectacular reasons really."

Calligraphy,3bgjg2,iesyia,3,Wed Jul 1 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Hello, fellow student of the Moutier-Grandval Bible, and welcome to reddit and its calligraphy community!   I'm not an expert at Carolingian, but it's probably my strongest hand...so, since you asked for hard feedback, here's my two cents:   What follows is going to seem like it's a lot of criticism, but honestly, you're off to a good start. I can tell you've looked at your exemplar. The thing that helped me most was reviewing my work, and I'd recommend that to you as well -- look at the previous day's practice, compare it to your exemplar, be highly critical of every letter, note what's not looking quite right, and practice those strokes to try to correct them. Then launch into your practice for the day. I know you saw this on your own, but the spacing could definitely use some work. The letters are pretty crowded -- they need some room to breathe. In particular, watch out for thick strokes connecting with each other (e.g., 'ar,' especially in ""darknesses""). The letters connect with some frequency in the MGB, but when it happens, it's pretty much always with a thin stroke that flows into the following letter.     Regarding angle: you might want to slant your letters just a smidge more to the right. Try to make the clubbed ascenders flow smoothly into the thin part of the stroke. Bringing that 'wedge' stroke down a little closer to the baseline should help give a smoother transition.  The o form is critical to a lot of letters. The b, c, d, e, l, q, t, and even the u all have some aspect of the first stroke of the o in common. (Even that diagonal stroke of the a echoes the o a little bit at the end, as it springs up to join the next letter). Be aware of that as you make your letters. E.g., your e stays thick too long into the stroke, and the bottom of your l is too short -- it looks more like the stem stroke that's part of the d. Let that e and f off the leash a little bit! You're cutting off the crossbar stroke on the early side for both letters; they usually butt into the following letter.  Also -- the f in the MGB usually drops a little below the baseline, possibly to help visually distinguish it from the long s. The g is a tough letter. Try making the bowl of the g a little smaller (in the MGB, you can see the shape is completed above the baseline). You'll also probably want to tame the curve of the descender a little bit -- it veers off to the right too much, and it shouldn't 'underline' the next letter. Also, watch the ear coming off the top of the bowl. In the MGB, it springs out of the bowl of the g at about 3 o'clock, and is fairly straight with a slight upward tilt -- very much like the crossbars on e and f.  Regarding the long s: As you mentioned in a later post, it is definitely historically corroborated in the Moutier-Grandval Bible (hereafter MGB). Words end with the long s all over the place in that document.  That said (and this is my own opinion, so please take this with a grain of salt) -- archaic letterforms like the long s don't scan well to the modern eye. Even when I know what I'm looking at, my brain just wants to read ""f"". And when I have to stop and think about what the text is saying, it detracts from appreciating the beauty of the letterforms. I totally respect your use of the long s, and if it were in a language that I didn't understand, I highly doubt I'd have any problem with it at all; it's only because my brain is trying to read/comprehend the letters that it scans as ""wrong"" at first glance. It certainly doesn't look bad as a letterform taken on its own.    I know there's no example of the short s in the MGB, but I made up my own that's informed by the structure of other letters; it actually draws a lot from the g. My Carolingian's rusty because I've been focused on Copperplate, but I did the QotW last week in it, and it has a couple of (poorly done) short s's in it if you you want to see what I mean.  Ok, I'm going to stop now -- it's late, and I need to sleep! Hope this helps. Good luck to you. :)"
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,pastellist,5,Thu Jul 2 04:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback! This--the advice of a more trained eye--is what I was hoping for, as it would've taken me a long while feeling vaguely wrong about something before noticing all the issues. I will pay attention to these problems when I practice tonight. I personally also have trouble reading the long s, but was hesistant to make one up myself. Yours seem to fit in the rest of the letterforms quite well, I'll probably do something like that.  A question: How did you do the clubbed ascenders? Some (especially the second l and h in the third line and the l's in the fifth line) almost seem like the ""club""s are on the right side of the letter. You did mention using a flexible nib for the piece though, would a Mitchell nib do that?"
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,iesyia,2,Thu Jul 2 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I'm really glad it was helpful.   Regarding the clubbed ascenders: Even though I used a flexible nib (I clipped off the tip of a Brause 66EF, which is a pointed pen nib...fun to use, but weird) for that piece, I still made the stroke as I normally would with a stiffer nib.   To make the clubbed ascenders, I place the nib down a little bit above the waistline, make sure the ink is flowing, and then quickly move it up and slightly to the left until I'm almost at the ascender line. Then I curve the stroke at the very top to soften it, and pull it straight down at the angle of the letters. If you'd like, I can do a step-by-step example for you sometime today.  I've also seen people do the main stroke first, lift the pen, move back to the top of the ascender, and then pull a second stroke down toward the waistline to form a club. It's possible that doing it that way might be more consistent, especially for a beginner, but I find that this script really benefits from developing a rhythm and speed -- and more pen lifts = less speed. (Besides...if I'm ever going to finish my ridiculous project of copying The Lord of the Rings, I need all the speed I can get! Heh.)  The examples where the clubs are on the right side of the letter are mostly just me being rusty/sloppy with the script (and the nib!) and screwing up :P At some point I'll experiment with making the clubs just with pressure from that nib, but I'm not sure if it'll work well. I haven't yet tried Mitchell nibs, although I keep meaning to do so."
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,pastellist,2,Thu Jul 2 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to what I did, except for the position of the wedge thing, but an example would certainly be appreciated.  Had trouble trying to do it in two strokes, so I guess I'm going with this way anyway. Indeed the rhythm seems slightly disrupted by going back and adding the club."

I couldn't see your previous comment, and since I couldn't remember your username, I couldn't even PM you. Thanks for being patient.  Here's how I make Carolingian ascenders.

Calligraphy,3bgjg2,PurpleCHEEZMint,4,Wed Jul 1 04:08:50 2015 UTC,That's the carolingian long s.
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,iesyia,2,Wed Jul 1 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I believe it's only to be used in the middle of words, though. Ah yes wiki says: The long, medial, or descending s (ſ) is a form of the minuscule letter s, which was formerly used where s occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. ""ſinfulneſs"" ""sinfulness"").   I am quite font of your artwork, regardless of the s choice. The shading is excellent."
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,xenizondich23,4,Wed Jul 1 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, did read about that before, but the manuscript I referred to doesn't seem to have a normal short s (except in the uncial majuscules), and the long s is used in the end of the word (2r right column first word) or double s's, so it's not like j, k or w which simply didn't exist then. Now I'm confused.  Edit: The other three links in the historical examples page also have the long s at the end of a word...   Apparently the Wikipedia link says   During this period, it was occasionally used at the end of a word, a practice that quickly died but that was occasionally revived in Italian printing between about 1465 and 1480. Thus, the general rule that the long s ""never occurred at the end of a word"" is not strictly correct, although the exceptions are rare and archaic.   Not sure, seems more than rare in this case, but I only flipped through a few pages."
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,iesyia,2,Thu Jul 2 02:04:35 2015 UTC,You are correct. See my comment above.
Calligraphy,3bgjg2,GardenOfWelcomeLies,2,Thu Jul 2 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"That is certainly the most common historical practice, yes. But there is no short 's' in the Grandval bible's carolingian script—including at the end of words. The letter 'S' only ever appears in other scripts further up the hierarchy, such as Uncial, Rustica, and drawn Romans.  That being said, OP didn't quite get the 'ſ' from the Grandval Bible right. It is not as tall as other ascenders, and its stem should descend slightly below the baseline. The 'f' by comparison is a little taller (yet still not quite as tall as 'l') and extends further down below the baseline like a 'p' or 'q'.  Edit: my own little example"

In calligrapher's terms, this is not illumination—that term is reserved specifically for the use of gold, because it makes the page glow—as if illuminated from within.  What you have written here is a versal, or decorated initial.  If I can offer some brief advice, it is to take some more time to study Italic; I don't feel you have a solid grasp of many of the key points of the script.   I would pay particular attention to the pen angle (should be 45°), the x-height (should be around 5pw), and most especially the triangular interior arch on key letters. The hint of it is there, but it needs study and development.  I unfortunately don't have the time to prepare any comprehensive materials for you nor do a big write-up, but compare these two takes on the same word in your piece. On the left is Foundational hand and on the right, Italic. Look at the arches of letters like 'h', 'a', 'n', and 'g' in Italic, and compare to the flatter, symmetrical arches of letters like 'h' and 'n' in Foundational. You need to understand that arch and use it well to master the Italic script.  This is all just my opinion of course, feel free to take or leave it, as you will."

A few notes on their contents:   I tried a lot of different broad edge nibs before I got anything to work for me. Brause just seem to be much more user friendly. A slant board can just be anything flat and solid. I sit a bit of wood that used to be part of a computer desk on my lap, and lean it against my usual writing desk.   Also, faux walnut ink makes life better."
Calligraphy,3batk0,BestBefore2016,2,Sat Jun 27 20:35:55 2015 UTC,Are you diluting the Sumi ink with water?   Have you tried adjusting the reservoir (either distance from edge or angle to tines)?
Calligraphy,3batk0,IowaPharm2014,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:59:58 2015 UTC,"I did briefly try mixing with water, but the results were again inconsistent. Haven't attached the reservoir to the nib - would that make a significant difference to the ink flow? I thought a reservoir just allowed you to write for longer without dipping?"
Calligraphy,3batk0,cawmanuscript,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"It can make a difference with Mitchell.  /u/IowaPharm2014 has some great advice.  Most Sumi need some diluting but dont dilute the whole bottle.  Put some in a smaller container and add a few drops of water, continue until you get a good flow.    The reservoir should be about 1 mm from the end and no more than 2 mm.  Also try loading your nib with a brush instead of dipping it in as that can overload the nib and cause a large drop when the nib touches a paper.  The reservoir should fit on snugly but not too tight.  When it is on, look at the nib edge and it should be straight.  If it looks squeezed together then adjust the sides of your resevoir to loosen it on the nib.  It would be much easier to show than describe.   Keep a damp rag close by and continue to wipe the nib off and eventually it will get broken in so the ink sticks to in and flows properly to the nib end."
Calligraphy,3batk0,ThenWhenceComethEvil,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:49:26 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Calligraphy,3batk0,lantern53,2,Sat Jun 27 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"I use Sumi Moon Palace, but when I dilute it it's more around 1:3 or 1:4 (ink:water).   Granted this is for pointed pen. But I've found pretty good success with broad-edge using a similar dilution. Most of my broad-edge is actually walnut."
Calligraphy,3batk0,cawmanuscript,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:34:56 2015 UTC,The reservoir controls the flow of ink to the paper. Nobody can do decent calligraphy with a chisel edge without a reservoir.
Calligraphy,3batk0,dollivarden,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't use a reservoir on Brause .5, .75, 1 mm and Mitchell 5 and 6.  I only use a reservoir on nibs bigger than those listed.  It works for me and everyone is different.  I"

The other points can be worked on once the basis are consistent so dont despair.  You are certainly not a beginner and you are ready for the next step.  I haven't forgotten that I would pay attention to your work now that I have returned from vacation.  This piece is certainly an improvement from your QOTW a couple of weeks ago.

Yesterday, when I took a good hard look at your piece, it was obvious that you had a good grasp of the basics.  I did up a sheet with some suggestions for you.  The two biggest things are your consistency and inter word spacing.  Feel free to ask questions or disregard if you wish.  Hope it helps you out."
Calligraphy,3b9ytu,cawmanuscript,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:20:54 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for doing this! Do you have any suggestions for the best way to practice your recommendations?
Calligraphy,3b9ytu,GardenOfWelcomeLies,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  As for practicing, I break practice down into two types. I will either practice to refine my letterforms or to improve my rhythm. I pick out some text that I know well, line up and get ready.  When I start, I finish a page; don't get distract by changing scripts, styles, redoing letters, correcting mistakes etc; just plow through.  When I practice letterforms, I take my time trying to do the forms as perfect as I can and when I work on rhythm I speed up; working on rhythm rather than letterforms.  Here is a slower letterform practice done in 2010 and rhythm practice done this afternoon. After you have finished you can review your work and pick out things to work on in the future.  I do about half and half in my practice. It is a rare day when I am not in study for several hours. I know my style has changed slightly as it always has and always will.  Don't fight it; let your style mature.    I think the best quote about practicing is from a Denis Brown workshop, ""the best thing you can do for your calligraphy is to do more; the worst thing you can do for your calligraphy is to do more when you don't want to""  I don't know if I have answered any specific questions and would be happy to do so if you still need them.  Keep going and do some real pieces, even if it is only for your portfolio."

Calligraphy,3b3f41,dongen,10,Thu Jun 25 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"Uppercase B is a difficult letter. The upper bowl of your B is a big saggy. I don't practice the foundational hand but I think you can improve your B if you start its upper bowl at the top (north west) by moving your pen (more) horizontally to the right, and then gradually start forming the curve, making sure you increase the pen angle as you're getting closer to the end. Make sure the surface area of the bottom bowl is slightly larger and slightly more wide than the top bowl. IMHO the diamonds in the B spoil the letter because of the difference in colour, which is caused by them overlapping the B's spine. I'd add a bit more space after the uppercase B. The v (?) in beliebe (?) looks like a b. Not sure if this is deliberate. If not, don't worry: mistakes like this happen when you're concentrating on the writing, not on the reading. Besides that, the lowercase letters look fine to me."

Calligraphy,3b4o1m,TomHasIt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:38:11 2015 UTC,Please do!
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,my_butt_is_confused,2,Fri Jun 26 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"yay! As you probably already know, I'm far from being even remotely good so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. I just noticed that we share some ""imperfections"" and someone from here pointed them out to me. Also forgive me if my explanations don't make sense.  But first, let me say that I find it beautiful how the thickness of your thick lines (?) is consistent throughout, I struggle a lot with that.  Ok, starting with the lead-in stroke, it should hit the next letter at the outermost left part of the shade, yours touch the letters a bit too low (e.g. ""lo"" and ""ra"" in holograph"", ""ha"", ""nd"" ""te"" in handwritten). Also I believe (but not entirely sure) that this stroke is part of the letter and it should be present even at the first letter of the word.  As for the ovals, I think they're a little bit too shaded at the top. Start without pressure at the top and add pressure as you're going down for maximal thickness just below the half of the x-height. I would refer you to this recent comment by u/BestBefore2016.  Also, I find it difficult to get the square tops right away so most of them just need some re-touching when your done (I like to do it when the ink is still wet so it doesn't look sloppy). I read someone giving advice once about how you need to ""learn your nib"" and figure out which way it open and in that sense when you start the letter, before doing the stroke to open it in the right direction creating the square top.  Lastly, in terms of letter size and spacing, this diagram by Joe Vitolo explains how the letters' size should all be the same if you cover the top half of the word. (done right in the ""tt"" in handwritten but not in ""ocu"" in document for example).  If anyone has more expertise, please correct me if I'm wrong. Again, take whatever I say with a grain of salt as I'm just a beginner myself.  :D"
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,my_butt_is_confused,2,Fri Jun 26 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, one more thing!  The downstroke on letters like ""a,d,g,.."" look prettier when they don't cross the oval but just barely touch it more like the ""a"" in handwritten"". Again, I'm not entirely sure if that's a rule or it's just aesthetic preference but that was pointed out to me once and I like it better hehe.  I'm gonna shut up now."
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,TomHasIt,2,Fri Jun 26 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"No, you've been immensely helpful! Thank you for taking the time to point very specific things out, and to link to /u/BestBefore2016's comment (which is also really informative).   As I'm working on Copperplate, I find myself really struggling with ovals, so seeing specific instructions written out is huge. Most old tutorials I see just say, ""Now, draw an oval,"" without much more written about the subject. Now I can see that I need to start in with a hairline and lower where the shade starts quite a bit.  Seriously, thanks again. Looking forward to incorporating this criticism into my practice tonight!"
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,Eseoh,3,Fri Jun 26 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. I would go through/u/bestbefore 2016 and his previous /u/bestbefore2015 comment history as he gives very detailed and helpful advice and criticism. Also, make sure to try and study some exemplars from master penman and constantly compare your work with theirs. You're definitely on the right track. Just practice and keep up the good work."
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,TomHasIt,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions! As a beginner, I find I gravitate toward anything explicated, step-by-step (like Eleanor Winters or Vitolo), and have a harder time pulling instruction from exemplars from master penmen off IAMPETH. I look at them and think, ""Ok, I see -what- I'm supposed to do, but -how- will I accomplish that?"" But a lot of the comments on this sub revolve around pulling instruction from exemplars, which I feel inadequate to the task of. So, that's a struggle I'm trying to figure out at the moment."
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,BestBefore2016,2,Fri Jun 26 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Studying from exemplars is nontrivial. This might sound kinda bad, but the truth of the matter is that you probably don't see what you're supposed to do. Our brains may fool us into thinking otherwise, but when we look at exemplars, we don't automatically dissect everything and make real observations; after you look away there's just a vague, fuzzy image in your head—missing all the important details.  Here are some things you could do to make study of exemplars more productive:   Overlay guidelines, so you can see each stroke in the context in which you're used to making them. Overlay more lines! If you cut the x-height into two equal sized pieces, you will more accurately see the proportions of the forms. After, you could try cutting it into three or four sections for further scrutiny. Put your exemplars temporarily out of sight, take out a pencil and an eraser, then sketch in detail (with guidelines) a word from the exemplar at an x-height of something like 2-3 cm, or an inch. Now compare it to the relevant exemplar, scanning every detail of every form, looking for key differences. It may be helpful to scan your work in, resize it appropriately, then use one of the blending modes in something like photoshop or gimp to overlay your work on the exemplar in such a fashion that you see both your forms and the originals in direct contrast."
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,TomHasIt,2,Fri Jun 26 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you for laying this out for me. When I look at historical exemplars, I typically feel awe for their skill, then intimidation because I don't know where to begin dissecting it. Then I go running for someone to dissect it for me. You've given me a good set of tools to start doing it myself, which I know is an important part of growing as a calligrapher.  Quick question on exemplars--can I assume that basically every image on the IAMPETH site is a good exemplar? Is there a way, as a neophyte, to tell the difference between good and not-as-good?"
Calligraphy,3b4o1m,BestBefore2016,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"Well ... there are various things to be leery of when going through the IAMPETH exemplars. Some of the samples aren't the best quality, some of them are more modern in their influences and it shows, some of them are the result of great penmen having some fun by mixing in a little Ornamental Penmanship. Of course, even the best samples have their own quirks and imperfections.  Imo you should give precedence to the works of Baird where possible. Secondarily: Lupfer, Howe and Fields. For the lattermost, the main body of text (and not the title) of the rough draft of his Zanerian certificate is quite illustrative. Because effort has not been taken to clean it up, you can more easily see the way he did things."

Calligraphy,3b5k9j,bbsoulcrush,3,Fri Jun 26 03:45:32 2015 UTC,"Seconding Italic or Foundational if you want to get into broad-edge. From the sample you showed us, though, it looks like you're heading towards Textura Quadrata. That's easy to get the basics of, but there are a lot of subtleties to it that will need time to come clear.  For pointed-pen, you're probably looking for something in the Copperplate family. Keep in mind that there are some substantial differences between how broad-edge and pointed-pen are done, so you ought to stick to one or the other until you've got the hang of things."

I am not saying a Shodo Calligrapher can not do it, Its just a bit different. Getting it done would not be the problem. The problem would be the shipping, the frame would be very large (4 x 4 feet), if they sent just the paper you would have to pressed it correctly to remove the wrinkles.  What kind of framing where you thinking? Are you thinking of the traditional scroll framing or in a picture frame? The traditional Japanese scroll framing looks so nice when it mounted in your house. I have few around my house, but you need to take care. The traditional way is to have a few different ones and swap them ever few months. I have been told its to let the paper relax after been stretched by the hanging.   I am guessing you are not planning on swapping something so large, so if it was me I would just get it framed behind glass.   As for me the reason I know a bit about this is because i run an online calligraphy magazine and I study Shodo in Japan. Because of the website I have meet many calligraphers around the world and I am guessing you live in the states or canada because you are using feet. So if you like i might be able to ask a few people i know over there to help you. This would save you the shipping from japan and you will be able to speak to them in English."

With regards with the enso, there is no right or wrong way to do it as it more of a feeling you get from it. With regards to the brushes, well that is another story. Calligraphy brushes are not the same as paint brushes, but since you are doing it for fun. Its all good. My editor wrote a story about the brushes she made and used for her art. It was cool as I never thought about making my own brushes before reader her story.   Framing is really more for personal choice, but if it was me, I would put it in under glass. remember make sure its not in direct sunlight.   Another thing you will need is paper, go for washi and not the cheap stuff, as the paper can tear very easy. A large brush will soak up a lot of ink, and its very hard to control which is why its easy to tear the paper. The people at paperconnection.com might be able to help you with the paper.

The samples are organized into sections, with examples of ""strong lettering"" at the top, followed by ""modern lettering,"" ""cute/friendly lettering,"" and finally ""unassuming/unsophisticated/bad-in-a-way-that-looks-good lettering.""

Calligraphy,3b0ar0,callibot,2,Wed Jun 24 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if somebody could help me find something that was posted on here not too long ago. I do not remember what was posted by the OP, but in the comments somebody gave a somewhat lengthy response about the Carolingian script. He mentioned the x heights vs ascender/descender heights and gave two links of what I think was his own work. I really liked those examples, but can't find them again. I searched through many pages of this sub and even tried a custom Google search. Maybe someone remembers seeing it?"
Calligraphy,3b0ar0,Tikaal,5,Thu Jun 25 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"I remember that post, I think. It was /u/pastellist. This post?"
Calligraphy,3b0ar0,thundy84,2,Thu Jun 25 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, that looks like it. Thank you so much!"
Calligraphy,3b0ar0,Tikaal,3,Thu Jun 25 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"Came here because of /u/thundy84's paging -- glad you found it, and I'm really glad the post was helpful!  Also: just to set the record straight, I am, in fact, a she. :P (No need to apologize, btw -- just letting you know.)   If you decide to pursue it, good luck with the Carolingian -- it really is a lovely script."
Calligraphy,3b0ar0,pastellist,2,Thu Jun 25 02:32:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, I need to stop assuming everyone is a male. I love your work, it inspired me to keep practicing despite the slow progress."
Calligraphy,3b0ar0,Tikaal,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"I am so happy to have inspired you. :)  In some ways, calligraphy is like playing an instrument...if you keep practicing, you'll keep getting better. It's ok that progress is slow. Mastery will come in due time.   Best of luck to you in your pursuit of beautiful letters!"
Calligraphy,3axurn,Juultje,2,Wed Jun 24 11:07:58 2015 UTC,What kind of pen/holder is that?
Calligraphy,3axurn,jorgomli,3,Wed Jun 24 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Voilà, a ""Calligraphy glass pen"" it's actually a nice pen to write with, although the broad part is slightly too big for my hands."

Calligraphy,3aw3rs,bodybyxbox,4,Wed Jun 24 03:52:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I wrote it with a green tombow dual brush pen, then went over the area again with the other, smaller tip until it was shaded how I wanted it to be."

Calligraphy,3awc2b,The_Grape_Bucket,2,Wed Jun 24 06:32:45 2015 UTC,Maybe a Sakura GellyRoll pen? I have a set of metallics and they're pretty impressive for how much they cost. It could also be a Uni-Ball Signo.

Calligraphy,3axry5,dongen,2,Wed Jun 24 10:27:32 2015 UTC,"Your nib angle looks a little wider than 40-45º. And you should really use guidelines. I'd say this isn't bad though, especially being the first time writing with a new nib.  Can someone tell me the difference between Chancery Italic and regular Italic?"
Calligraphy,3axry5,derickjl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:40:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments.   I'll have to look at the angle. I did use guidelines underneath the paper, so you can't see them. The writing is so small and the paper so wrinkly, the lines may not appear parallel, but I can assure you they are. The slope of the letters is also relatively consistent. Cursive Chancery Italic was invented in the Vatican. There are many forms of Italic. I don't know what regular Italic is."
Calligraphy,3axry5,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"Chancery hand:       The term ""chancery hand"" can refer to either of two very different styles of historical handwriting.  A chancery hand was at first a form of handwriting for business transactions that developed in the Lateran chancery (the Cancelleria Apostolica) of the thirteenth century, then spread to France, notably through the Avignon Papacy, and to England after 1350.  This early ""chancery hand"" is a form of blackletter. Versions of it were adopted by royal and ducal chanceries, which were often staffed by clerics who had taken minor orders.  A later cursive ""chancery hand"", also developed in the Vatican but based on humanist minuscule (itself based on Carolingian minuscule), was introduced in the 1420s by Niccolò Niccoli; it was the manuscript origin of the typefaces we recognize as italic.

So now, I'm going to recommend something you won't really like. Sorry:  Don't start with this hand.   When you're starting out, most people (myself included) would strongly recommend starting out with Foundational or Italic. They're very well established calligraphic hands, and provide a strong basis from which branch out from. Starting with flourishes, or more complicated calligraphic hands, is going to make the basics/fundamentals substantially harder to master."
Calligraphy,3axry5,ThenWhenceComethEvil,2,Wed Jun 24 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments; no harm done by your recommendation. My main interests in the Italic hand is using it in day-to-day handwriting. With a fountain pen I can write Italic at a reasonable speed and my next goal is turning it into pretty writing:) FWIW 1: initially, I misread your comment, and I agree with the comment about flourishes making things more complicated. FWIW 2: I know the Foundational hand, I know the origins, but I hate it. I much more like Johnston's interpretation of Italic (I just love the picture of Johnston's letter in Plate 74 of A Book of Scripts), but not as much as original Italic hands,"
