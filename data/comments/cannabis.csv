In a move, which will be seen as a further step towards decriminalisation, Durham Police has said it will only go after people growing and using the drug if there is a complaint or if they are being “blatant”.  While the force has insisted it will continue to tackle large scale cannabis farms and other areas of criminality associated with the drug, those who grow and use the cannabis at home will not be actively pursued.

It's just one more reason why cannabis should be decriminalized and one more thing that proves this prohibition was based on bullcrap.  The government is actually addressing the fact that not only cannabis prohibition, but, the war on drugs has been poorly executed and ,in general, has been a bad idea all around.

Which GOP candidate would you like to see in the general election?   Paul, obviously.  And Sanders for the DNC.  They'd both move their respective parties in a better direction."
cannabis,3bo5cj,rainbowwow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't matter which one of them is the lesser of all the evils on offer. They are all climbing over each other in a frantic attempt to out conservative each other. And the conservative values they all claim to espouse are ridiculous at best and scary as hell at worst. These are people who claim to believe that starting wars is a good idea. The GOP is the party that started, supported, and continues to spew propaganda about cannabis like how many people have died from using it. These are people who want to go backwards in social issues and, for the most part,  in drug law enforcement (drug testing welfare recipients, for example), further criminalizing a plant. Which one of them will do the least damage? It's a toss up and won't impact who I support. Yes, the GOP will probably continue to control the senate and/or the house, but that doesn't mean the voting public should just throw their hands up and hand over the presidency to the GOP."

cannabis,3bo5cj,sleepyslim,3,Wed Jul 1 10:58:30 2015 UTC,"When it comes to the two major parties, yes, Rand is by far the best option of mainstream candidates when it comes to marijuana. I'd say about half of the Republican candidates are taking a ""states' rights"" approach when in comes to medical marijuana, and a few are are entertaining recreational if it passes in states. Paul is however actively talking about War on Drugs in a broader context, including it's racial bias and assault on civil liberties. He's supportive of decriminalizing marijuana at a federal level as well as opening the door for broader marijuana research. I should note that Sanders is a close second, being heavily supportive of medical marijuana and coming out against the War on Drugs."
cannabis,3bo5cj,MikiLove,0,Wed Jul 1 01:40:52 2015 UTC,Missing the forest for the trees.  Rand Paul being elected would be terrible for the United States.  He's pandering.  Zero fucks given about the American people with that guy.
cannabis,3bo5cj,pcar773,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"To be clear, you think a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination is faking support for removing federal prohibitions on marijuana in order to gain an electoral advantage with the GOP base?  That's... an interesting hypothesis.  Does that also apply to his non-interventionist foreign policy, or opposition to domestic spying, or opposition to the disenfranchisement of non-violent felons."
cannabis,3bo5cj,rainbowwow,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that he's pandering to the pro-pot crowd in order to gain access to a voting block that typically doesn't turn out in elections.    With how close elections are nowadays and with how pathetic the turnout of Millennials is, an additional 10k or 20k votes could make a big difference.  Regardless of his intentions, he's a terrible candidate with some incredibly stupid ideas of governance that will destroy our country."
cannabis,3bo5cj,pcar773,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:29:53 2015 UTC,So you think being pro-pot would be a net gain in a GOP primary? And a net gain with his foreign policy? And a net gain with his opposition to domestic spying? And a net gain with his opposition to the disenfranchisement of nonviolent felons? And a net gain with his opposition to corporate welfare? I don't think anyone seriously thinks that.  I think perhaps you are a bit fixated on the general election. Who would you prefer be the GOP nominee?
cannabis,3bo5cj,rainbowwow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Millennials are the largest demographic since baby boomers.  They are also the bloc with the lowest turnout.  So yeah, I think Rand is making a hard push for Millennials."
cannabis,3bo5cj,pcar773,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt he's pandering when it fits with his larger Libertarian ideology. Do I agree with all his principles, no. He's a little extreme in many of his views, including government role in the economy. But his pro-pot stance is similar to his father, which wanted to decriminalize all drugs. He wants to do it simply because it's a waste of time and resources for the federal government, and it infringes on American's right to privacy. I highly doubt he's a soulless politician who wants to destroy this country. He's trying to fire up his base of young Republicans, who tend to be much more Libertarian, and shed some light on the issue to maybe change older Republican views. If anything this might hurt him in the primaries, which makes him even more commendable."

Though the article points out that NC had weed decriminalized in the 70s, we should also remember that at that time NC was still forcing some blacks and poor people to be sterilized at that time.  And the 70s was at the height of the decriminalization movement just after the Vietnam War when the American people forced our criminal government to end that war -- the height of the American people's power -- and before Reagan seized power in the 1980 election and started moving our entire political spectrum to the political right.   ""Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed.

Biggest neg development recently has been the closure of a dozen or so coffeeshops in the Red Light District, as part of a 'regeneration scheme', and extra restrictions on opening hours for other shops that are near schools.

cannabis,397dhb,MrWalkingTarget,7,Wed Jun 10 23:27:43 2015 UTC,Large cohort studies and statistical studies are inconclusive - meaning there's not a large enough control group with a strong enough statistical confidence interval to make a conclusion.

cannabis,397dhb,MrWalkingTarget,0,Wed Jun 10 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"What the fuck is that supposed to even mean. Larger cohorts mean increased statistical strength. EVERY study uses statistics. You are probably referring to association studies... Which cannot show causality between related variables. Still... These are useful when we have other types of studies showing potential mechanisms of action, which we do in the case of THC and marijuana."
cannabis,397dhb,MrWalkingTarget,4,Wed Jun 10 17:49:52 2015 UTC,It means that the existing large group studies are not showing a strong enough statistical link to make any statement with a good degree of confidence.   Purely statistical studies need to be properly controlled and currently suffer from a very large self-identification bias.
cannabis,397dhb,MrWalkingTarget,-1,Thu Jun 11 02:26:51 2015 UTC,Have you had statistics? Multivariate?
cannabis,397dhb,MrWalkingTarget,3,Thu Jun 11 02:29:34 2015 UTC,"have you?  A large cohort study of this type is typically done retrospectively. You would need to identify the various routes of cannabis administration to find the smokers, which while a large portion, do not make up 100% of users. You then need to exclude concurrent users of tobacco products and exclude them from the model and follow only those people who report usage of smoked Cannabis alone and then control against members of the cohort with similar age, income level, relative beginning health and familial genetic factors. That's the only way to get a true statistic for Cannabis related disease.   Due to the illegal nature of Cannabis, all of these studies also suffer from self-reporting bias - people who will lie about use, downplay or under report frequency of use, etc.  This further suffers from the factor that a non-insignificant segment of Cannabis smokers will be those using it to deal with stress or illness.   Multivariate statistics, while useful, would not assist in further refining reporting.   Simply put, a ""large cohort"" has yet to show a statistically strong link between moderate cannabis use and airway diseases.   This is not significant on it's own though, due to the difficulty in obtaining and tracking enough specific cases in that population."

Studies that take into account socio economic indicators do not find these effects. OP is citing studies that are finding social effects and mis-attributing them to marijuana.

Most research is done by Universities, so what do you mean by ""Government Researchers?.""   Why not cite any of the multiple studies showing no effect on teenagers?   Because in Neuroscience we deal with complex physiological mechanisms and its easy to miss things; there's a reason why articles like that aren't submitted to journals.  I understand your concerns, if I were to post articles concerning marijuana showing no adverse affectivity then I would simply be posting every article I could find about marijuana which is not the purpose of this post.  As for negative affectivity in regards to the specific pathophysiological mechanisms that I posted (i.e axon fibre inhibition, altered cerebral blood flow, white matter, and cognitive decline after adolescent use) I don't think there is reputable research that exists that states the contrary but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong  It's a dangerous fallback to blame the Pharm industry on a lack of findings.  There are Thousands of privately funded research institutions out there.  When you start taking the word of one or two researchers over all the rest in the field, you may want to do some bias checking of your own.  EDIT: I'm going to watch your video in a bit  Watched it.  Dr. Dreher points out in the Jamaica study that it is far from conclusive. The population in this group was small (33 users and 27 non users), and there’s an abundance of other research that contradicts its findings in significant ways. For example, Lidush Goldschmidt, et al. at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that prenatal marijuana use was significantly related to increased hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention symptoms, increased delinquency and externalizing problems later in life.  It's interesting to me that you're willing to reference unpublished research that the researcher herself acknowledges is incomplete while it contradicts essentially all other findings.  This is the logic that anti-vax follows."
cannabis,393jjq,Archimid,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"I work in a lab.    You aren't the only one. I was involved in research for about 10 years of my life at a highly ranked institution. I did research in physics, biology, and biophysics.   I have a fairly advanced understanding of statistics compared to the average redditor.   Furthermore, there's a conflict of interest section at the bottom of every piece of research which shows where funding came from. Most pharmacological studies include at least one large pharm company/government agency funding them. I made a point to choose articles that do not, because frankly they aren't hard to find.   I'm not sure why it was important to point this out.   DEA funding is not listed as a conflict of interest despite considerable flaws in the way their funding is awarded.    Do you have any research experience? All of these studies had controls.   Ok. Do you have any research experience?   Several of the studies you highlighted were association studies done on large populations of students. Simply ""having a control"" says nothing to WHAT those controls are.   What exactly is your role in the laboratory? This is something that should be pretty obvious to anybody that isn't a junior researcher.   Several studies have gone back forth on the effects of marijuana on children because of confounding social factors: poverty, abuse, bullying, mental disorders, access to healthcare, parental employment levels, etc are ALL known to affect IQ independently of the marijuana, and also known to coincide with abnormalities in the hippocampus,  prefrontal cortext, etc.. Several of the studies have shown that these effects disappear when controls are properly matched or that these abnormalities exist before the marijuana use even started.   As far as brain abnormalities go... even some brain scan studies have specifically mentioned that they could eliminate previous findings by properly matching for controls. This was shown in adolescents that smoked as many as nine times a week.   So... your responses are kind of weird. It is because of how they were controlled for that prompted my original comments, and yet the actual process of controlling for confounding factors in an experiment seems to be something you have difficulty understanding.    Because in Neuroscience we deal with complex physiological mechanisms and its easy to miss things; there's a reason why articles like that aren't submitted to journals.   Your ignorance continues to astound me.... I am referring to peer reviewed research that has been well covered in the media.   No offense... but is the school you attend even fourth tier?   It's a dangerous fallback to blame the Pharm industry on a lack of findings. There are Thousands of privately funded research institutions out there. When you start taking the word of one or two researchers over all the rest in the field, you may want to do some bias checking of your own.   Literally you are the only person making this argument. You have continued to bring up pharma over and over again... and I'm still confused why.   Nobody is arguing that pharmaceutical companies are misrepresenting the data... the argument (that you have malformed into a straw-man) is that they are LOBBYING against marijuana while conducting their own experiments to show that it actually does work for certain conditions.   I'm not sure why you think people believe that pharmaceutical companies are the ones the conducting research on child populations to malign it.   Most people are making the claim that the government is donning this role by selectively awarding funding. SO get your arguments straight maybe?  As for Dreher.... Its interesting you point that out. She cites comments in her own research and during that lecture (by the only other two  researcher teams in the field to present data on that topic) that even admitted their own studies had flawed control methods.   She even cites the above researchers own personal correspondence discussing their inability to control for cocaine and opiate use in American population studies which has undoubtedly affected cranial size.  Jamaican rasta communities are one of the few population groups to naturally eliminate these types of associations.  Also, the number of participants is only one factor affecting statistical strength, also important is the length of time and amount of data that was collected for participants (again something you should already be aware of if you have to do any kind of statistical analysis).   On a larger scale however, Jamaica has yet to shown any differences in mental health or neurological functioning despite wide spread use in the population."

Quotes:   McConnell’s ties to the Chaos go back to the late 1980s, when James Chao began donating to the senator. In 1993, McConnell married James’s daughter, Elaine Chao, a Republican activist and former Reagan administration official who would later serve as secretary of labor in the George W. Bush cabinet.     ...   At a Young Professionals Association of Louisville event this month, McConnell stressed his opposition to carbon dioxide limits imposed by the federal government that would impact the domestic coal market. He argued that such efforts would be fruitless given the role of coal in developing countries and the rising coal trade. Foremost [Maritime Corporation] ships routinely transport coal from ports in Australia and Colombia, countries with cheap coal, for export to Asia and Europe.   and....   McConnell has benefitted in many ways from his relationship with his in-laws.    The Republican Senate minority leader’s personal wealth grew seven-fold over the last ten years thanks in large part to a gift given to him and his wife in 2008 from James Chao worth between $5 million and $25 million (Senate ethics forms require personal finance disclosures in ranges of amounts, rather than specific figures). The gift helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year, and ensured they could pay off more than $100,000 in mortgage debt on their Washington home.    The generous gift made McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, with a net worth averaging around $22.8 million, according to The Washington Post’s review of his financial disclosures.   finally   McConnell has positioned himself over the years as a tough on drugs politician.   He's a hypocrite because he's 'tough on drugs' yet a major corporation tied to him has been caught smuggling 90 pounds of cocaine. If this was anybody on the opposite side of the aisle, people would be calling for his resignation."

He is putting his own interests before those of the people that he has been elected to represent. How dumb does he think we are? How does someone in good conscience take massive payouts from big pharmaceutical companies and then go on to profess that they are primarily concerned with the interests of the public, when it is clear that those same pharmaceutical companies that Matt Baker is receiving 'donations' from are pushing prescriptions onto people and causing a massive opioid and pain-killer crisis in our state? I have close family members and friends that are victims of this. They are suffering from depression and dysfunction that is a direct result of a cornucopia of prescription pain killer abuse. When will Matt Baker realize the pain and death he has on his hands, and that a legal and regulated marijuana market could solve a LOT of our problems in Pennsylvania? Does he truly believe that marijuana should remain a schedule 1 drug, making it classifiably more dangerous than cocaine? If so, he is truly ignorant and uneducated and is unfit to be the head of the Health Committee. There is a reason that an overwhelming majority (88%+) support legalization in PA (as well as the rest of the nation/world), and that reason is because it already is medicine to them, regardless of what Matt Baker or the FDA says.   Shame on you Matt Baker. If you really wanted ""only the best medicine that is proven to be safe and effective for our children and my heart breaks for children and parents who have to endure very serious epileptic seizure activity"" then you would stop spouting your inaccurate bull-shit and take all that money that you have received and turn around and use it to try and get medical cannabis legalized in PA immediately.  I urge anyone that lives in PA to contact him and express their thoughts. I have called several times (717-772-5371), and sent in several letters/email (mbaker@pahousegop.com). Here is mine, please send yours:     Rep. Matt Baker,  I am writing to urge you to reconsider your stance on medical marijuana, and to urge you to allow the House of Representatives to exercise their democratic right regarding Senate Bill 3 and put it up for a vote. As the Senate has now approved the bill twice with overwhelming support, and as close to 90% of Pennsylvanians-- that you were elected to represent-- support it, I join many others in adding my voice of support for the bill and the responsible use of cannabis. I am also writing to help you realize the irony of the behavior that you are displaying as an elected official and as the acting chair of the Health Committee, and bring to light the inaccuracies of your statements regarding the issue. With a wife that suffers from the endless pain that comes from severe Fibromyalgia, and a mother-in-law that suffers from both severe Fibromyalgia and the debilitating side effects of Crohn's disease, I am very passionate about educating myself, my family, and those such as yourself that stand in the way of an otherwise easily attainable solution to these ailments. I am writing to tell you unequivocally that you are wrong in stating that ""the lion's share of the medical community and medical associations are not recommending legalization of marijuana for medical purposes."" It is in fact the opposite. The science is sound, it is verifiable, and the responsible use of cannabis can and does not only treat, but can also altogether cure an extensive number of diseases and conditions-- including Crohn's disease. I have stood by sadly and watched as my mother has sought relief through a staggering amount of pharmaceuticals-- many of the same pharmaceutical companies from which you have received financial contributions-- going unsuccessfully from one combination of drugs to another, and eventually becoming addicted to prescription Morphine and steadily declining into severe depression and dysfunction. These profoundly negative side effects are a direct result of the drugs that she has been cornered into purchasing, and would be avoided entirely by treating her ailments effectively with cannabis. Next month the National Geographic will publish an in-depth look at the science and medicine of cannabis, in which Raphael Mechoulam, a world-renowned organic chemist and the discoverer of tetrahydrocannabinol, reports: “We have just scratched the surface … we may well discover that cannabinoids are involved in some way in all human diseases.” I look forward to the day when my wife and mother are legally permitted to use cannabis, a plant grown organically and naturally, to treat themselves and lessen the pain they experience on a daily basis, rather than the opioids or similarly harmful and addictive synthetic drugs that are currently being presented to them as their only option for treatment.  We all live in communities-- locally, nationally, and globally-- where the scales are quickly tipping in favor of full legalization. The majority, due to increased education, have abandoned misinformation and inaccuracies and recognized cannabis for what it is; a plant with very real, measurable, and quantifiable benefits. It is a shame that even though we are surrounded by more compassionate states, Pennsylvanian leaders and legislators such as yourself are uneducated on the subject and are afraid to come forward, recognize the facts, and amend or remove current apathetic legislative inaccuracies and misconceptions. Rather than sitting back and waiting to see what happens in other states, Pennsylvania could stand out and be an example and a champion for good. It is also unfortunate that you feel it necessary to wait for the federal government to make a move before Pennsylvania does, even though President Obama and his administration have expressed that exactly the opposite needs to happen; that states need to continue to take it upon themselves to change antiquated legislation before the federal government will take action. This is a very cyclical problem, and will remain just that until you, I, and anyone and everyone else that can, will stand up and take it upon themselves to change things for the better. As Henry David Thoreau said, “Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once?”  I am hopeful that you will educate yourself and ponder deeply the power that your actions can have not just on me and my loved ones, but on hundreds upon thousands of individuals in this the Keystone State of Pennsylvania that are eagerly waiting for the legal permission to access the compassionately God-given medicine that is cannabis.  Thank you,  [name withheld]  EDIT: added Matt Baker's direct email"

What this guy needs to understand is that the FDA not approving (or ""clearing,"" which is different than ""approving"" in the eyes of the FDA) something for market use is not the same thing as it being dangerous.    What it comes down to is the FDA will not clear or approve drugs/devices for market use unless they are provided with data to support clearance/approval.  But no one can give them said data because it is currently illegal to be in possession of cannabis - And how exactly can you test and gather data if you can't even possess the specimen in the first place?

So, this bill is simply bringing in to effect a 1990's law. What's stupid about it though is that the original bill is not being considered for changing, even though it was written well over 20 years ago - including which diseases marijuana can be prescribed for. The ONLY diseases are as follows:   glaucoma, symptoms resulting from the administration of chemotherapy cancer treatment, and spastic quadriplegia in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and hospitals and in accordance with FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and DEA administrative guidelines for procurement of the controlled substance from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

I know smoking Mj does something to my lungs in a negative way. It comes down to usage. Maybe the one or two joints a week will not cause issue. But when you smoke a joint day after day for most of your life you are going to have issues."

cannabis,36g0hi,jatnal91,2,Tue May 19 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"This article is cool but it's both non verifiable, and anecdotal. If you want to publish MMJ articles that can benefit the community then they should be cited, with evidence. Articles from medical journals, with clinical study procedures and credible authors are really the only ones that are worth anything. For crying out loud the woman doesn't even know what compound consistencies are in the drug she is administering to her toddler. CBD CB1 CB2, sure, but THC, to toddler...? There are 2 legal FDA approved tested and synthesized THC drugs (marinol and some other one)... A much safer choice for a toddler, with likely better results."

If that were the case, we'd still be sitting around wondering about whether MMJ might work, rather than having around two million people legally using it in various states who could be studied. People using it and talking about it is what gave other people the courage to try it."
cannabis,36g0hi,OldHippie,1 point,Tue May 19 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it's a huge honour to have gotten a response from you, you were the one who taught me how to make my first glass bong out of a goldschlagger bottle, you also taught me the ways of ABV.   Secondly, you're right, maybe this is a slight exaggeration, in reality I should have said that those types of articles are worth a lot more. I agree that some anecdotal evidence is extremely compelling. Sadly, as someone who loves MMJ, and used it to battle insomnia and migraines, I really do think this article is counter intuitive. It brands people who use MMJ in a negative way because it encourages the use of MJ in toddlers, completely ignoring the risks associated with usage in undeveloped brains, yet alone those of children, and does so without any scientific basis. It brands this community as irresponsible, which is not something we want considering the reputation MJ users are trying to change.  Lastly, to give some perspective as to my stance, I've sadly given up MJ recently and vowed to halt my use until I can convince my parents (I'm a 19 y.o who lives out of the house for the record) that some real good can be done (If they won't change I won't use). Seeing as how they are both MD's and Prof's in North America, I know more than most about the struggle of convincing physicians to look past the stigma. I read scientific publications by doctors and pharmaceutical studies on PubMed every single day, I know how much detail and testing is truly required to change the opinion of an academic, especially one in the health care profession. Here's the kicker, they are the ones who get to refer/prescribe MMJ, they belong to the American Academy of Paediatrics, and they unanimously oppose regulation outside of the FDA regulatory process.   tl;dr Yes anecdotal articles can be a great driver for social media attention in some cases, but if you ask me, I think this article does more harm then good (and that's not even considering what people might do to there kids after reading it.)"
cannabis,36g0hi,amitball,1 point,Tue May 19 06:43:47 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it's a huge honour to have gotten a response from you   Well, I'm honored that you feel honoured!   Sadly, as someone who loves MMJ, and used it to battle insomnia and migraines...I've sadly given up MJ recently and vowed to halt my use until I can convince my parents that some real good can be done   I am indeed hearing a lot of sadness here. It sounds like you are taking a martyr's stand as someone who has had presumably good results using MMJ against insomnia and migraines, and yet is giving it up to ""prove a point"" unnecessarily (at least from the logistical standpoint).   Perhaps you can bear the pain and bounce back from sleeplessness, but would you stubbornly hold to your point if you were having repetitive seizures (as a friend of mine does without her (illegal) MMJ)?  You and your parents seem to hold great stock in the FDA's process. In another comment, you talked about FDA-approved drugs like Marinol. Unfortunately, Marinol is the only form of ""medical marijuana"" that has actually killed people. There is nothing magic or ""scientifically safe"" about FDA-approved drugs, and I strongly recommend you check out the book Bad Pharma to find out just how unsafe and unscientific their approval process is (side effect warning: your eyes may bug out and head explode from reading it).   There are tens of thousands of medical studies on cannabis. It has been studied far more than almost any conventional medicine. It's way past time we stopped demanding more studies and started demanding more access for sick people. Let's face it, there's no possible way that a double-blind cannabis-only study on cancer patients will ever be approved in this country, so we're going to have to go with a certain amount of ""anecdotal"" evidence. Let's make sure these brave people doing experimental medicine on themselves and their kids don't do it in vain...use their experiences for science!"
cannabis,36g0hi,OldHippie,1 point,Tue May 19 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm lucky is because both migraines and insomnia do have other easily implemented treatments. To be honest, they might take a little longer, but there won't be any damage to my neural network... the amount of MJ I was running through was not necessarily healthy. To be fair, yes I agree, marinol and drobinol are THC only substitutes, so a CBD epilepsy treatment wouldn't be a candidate for either... that's not to say that weed cures epilepsy. It can be an anti-spasmatic and anti-convulsant, but statistically speaking, I'm almost sure that MJ triggers seizures for more epilepsy patients than it helps.   Interestingly though, a human study on 170+ epileptics who use MMJ showed a 52% improved rate for tonic clonic seizures caused by Dravet whereas only a 48% percent improved for other types of epilepsy. I believe only 10% reported a complete reduction in siezures whereas the 48-52% only saw a reduction lower than 50% frequency. This is all VERY promising, but I would think twice before giving an undeveloped brain THC... and if your friend knows a cbd treatment that works for him/her AND he is non responsive to other treatments or finds there side effects more harmful, then he should proceed with caution and continue to treat his condition while always making sure to educate himself on the research, but the solution here is surely not to drug toddlers,  who cannot even understand that they are consuming a mind altering substance. If proven to truly be of high efficacy, maybe my opinion will change, but I definitely think that this article could have better been used to research and provide real information. If the only evidence supporting the claims in the article is a screenshot of 2 MRI's side by side with one showing a smaller blob, thats not really too scientific in my personal opinion.  Sorry by the way if I come off as hostile, I last posted about 3 hours ago and I have since had a full nights sleep... yes very fucked up... I actually do support MMJ in many many cases, and fight for it, especially amongst the physicians around me... Including for epilepsy, including for cancer. It's just not easy when animal studies prove that the cancer effected is in the colon, liver and breast, whereas human study shows nothing. It's hard when all my work is undone by a 16 and pregnant girl who walks into the ER for the second time in 2 years and doesn't even know she's about to give birth yet alone of her pregnancy, to many, the fact that she smokes at least 3 joints a day might have to do with her having smoked herself stupid over the years. She gave birth both times, baby given up for adoption both times, ended up in foster care.   We have a hell of a battle to go, I just get frustrated when I feel people are being counter productive. Keep helping people and inspiring change in the world, you do a lot of good for a lot of people."
cannabis,36g0hi,amitball,2,Tue May 19 09:22:45 2015 UTC,"A heap of anecdotal reports leads to a meta-analysis, that then gives workable data. Forget this not, for this field of research is still new and we are learning literally every day.    As for the article, the cannabis seems to be helping her with the illness inducing effects of chemo.  Though cannabinoids may be playing a larger role than most may assume. Only time will tell, and as time goes on, more evidence supports that notion."
cannabis,36g0hi,PuzzleDuster,0,Tue May 19 04:52:56 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, just a shame that the FDA regulatory process and the AAP will never except anything short of mass scale human clinical trials that are tested vigorously, with placebos and blinds... Maybe indeed anecdotal evidence can lead to meta analysis and that could garner the attention required to both reclassify MMJ to Schedule2 and to raise enough investment to fund studies. It's my personal opinion however that, for example, anecdotal evidence such as the Sunjay Gupta documentaries regarding Charlotte Figi and CBD's potential success in blocking Grand Mal seizures caused by Dravet syndrome actually do a lot of good for the communities push, whereas these kinds of articles come off as absolute bullshit media, and actually slow the positive impact other evidence presented in better and more verified ways. This is in my opinion, taking a piece of evidence that could further the cause, and instead of treating it as delicately as we should, shitting all over it completely and then publishing that to some random website."

Those guys would sit around and get fucked up on every drug they had access to just to have 'visions'. You may have been reading for 25 years, but you sure as hell didn't learn anything. I have no doubt that it has medical benefits, but it didn't cure this little girl's cancer, chemotherapy did. If they opted out of chemo in favor of cannabis only, this girl would be far worse off. Cancer is an incredible resilient thing, and even under very tightly controlled laboratory conditions, unaltered cannabis compounds haven't been proven to reliably kill cancer cells. Let alone inside a person. You're mindlessly supporting something with no scientific basis, which is what can kill people. Go bang on a drum or something, when you grow the fuck up and decide to look at everything with scrutiny, come back and have an actual discussion."
