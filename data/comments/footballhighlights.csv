footballhighlights,3e29ic,Death_Pancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:12 2015 UTC,Probably a good idea to use a spoiler tag on this.
footballhighlights,3e29ic,Tripptek,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"Hah crap. I'll just delete it. Quality take though, right?"
footballhighlights,3e29ic,Death_Pancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:08 2015 UTC,Let my upvote speak for me when I assume that was a quality take

footballhighlights,3dun3l,mightier_mouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:55:48 2015 UTC,Indeed!
footballhighlights,3dun3l,decho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:55:51 2015 UTC,"Hey mate, the audio goes off around 42:30, just letting you know. I think it's also desync cause the commentator says ""The referee blows the final whistle...."" etc.  I didn't watch the whole thing, just skipped ahead a bit."
footballhighlights,3dun3l,decho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:06 2015 UTC,Openload can be a bit temperamental at times. The file itself is fine and I just checked openload and there were no audio or sync issues for me (in fact they were perfect). Sometimes you just need to refresh a few times to get it playing correctly. It also helps if you go a bit slowly and allow all the elements to load.
