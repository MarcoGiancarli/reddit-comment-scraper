whitepeoplefacebook,3d37so,PixelsAreYourFriends,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:53 2015 UTC,I'm from the south. The flag is racist. Using a racist flag to support gay rights is weird and ignorant

whitepeoplefacebook,3d37so,PixelsAreYourFriends,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:13:21 2015 UTC,"what the fuck is your problem? Where did I say ""all southerners are racist"" or ""all southerners are ignorant"". The fact is...if you fly a confederate flag, you are one or the other...no matter where you are from. If you fly a gay pride flag (showing support for one oppressed group) while flying a confederate flag (being against another oppressed group), you are a idiot."
whitepeoplefacebook,3d37so,jenjen265,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"Better question: where did I claim that you're calling southerners racist or ignorant? I did neither, but you, in fact, did call all people to use the flag those two and an idiot.   So let's tally this up: I said literally nothing about calling anyone names, but you called people 3 so far."

If you know what the flag stands for, and you still fly it, you are a racist. If you fly the flag without knowing it's history, you are ignorant. If you fly the flag while knowing it's history, and choose to fly it alongside the gay pride flag, you are an idiot. I'm not sure why that's so hard for you to understand."
whitepeoplefacebook,3d37so,jenjen265,0,Mon Jul 20 23:13:51 2015 UTC,"Again, let's tally it up: Can't detect sarcasm, claims I use the flag even though I don't, calls me racist even though I'm not, calls people who choose to use it and the pride flag idiots, then insults me saying i can't understand when I think we all know who is the one who can't understand.

whitepeoplefacebook,3d37so,jenjen265,0,Tue Jul 21 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"Never said you claimed all southerners are racists. Again, you're making shit up.  Never said or implied I was offended. Basic middle school ""you gonna cryyyyyy?"" tactics don't work on adults, bud.  If you can detect sarcasm, then why didn't you before? Again, another child tactic of watching people point out your flaws then saying ""nuh uh, i totally can!""  Downvoting comments instead of coming up with arguments that actually make sense. Yet another childish tactic of thinking points on internet forums mean anything.   So that makes (don't worry, I'll do the math for you) 4 stupid arguments.  Grow up, dude."

whitepeoplefacebook,3bayjq,fusionx13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that refusing service to gay people is not clear cut or that refusing service to black people is not clear cut?  From the article   The entire United States is covered by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by privately owned places of public accommodation on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. Places of “public accommodation” include hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, health clubs and stores. Nonprofit organizations such as churches are generally exempt from the law.   The article goes on to say that you can't just make a rule like ""no tie, no business"" and only apply it to black people. But that ""no shoes, no shirt, no service"" isn't discrimination if the owner applies it to everyone."
whitepeoplefacebook,3bayjq,known0thing,2,Mon Jul 13 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"But its their business. Most likely its a family owned place. Even if it isn't I wouldn't want to be a customer there anyways. It's not morally correct but people can choose who they serve. I don't think it's cool, and its definitely not a good business practice. Hey, fuck em. If they want to let their views prevent them from making more money then it ain't worth it.   Just think, say a car repair place doesn't serve gays. Now the law says they can't legally turn any one away because or sexual orientation. I will bet you the gay person would not only get a shitty job done on the car but they may also ruin it somehow. Shady shit like happens. I say if they are prone to treating people wrong then don't treat them at all."
whitepeoplefacebook,3bayjq,fusionx13,-1,Mon Jun 29 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're totally right. And while we're at it we should stop making people do business with other minority groups! I mean, it's their choice. If they're morally opposed to someone being black they shouldn't have to serve them! After all, they'll probably get worse service anyway.  Oh wait, that's fucking stupid. Take a history class. Separating people doesn't make things better."
whitepeoplefacebook,3bayjq,Mewzen,4,Thu Jul 9 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"Well I'm black and if I knew that a place didn't want to do business with me but had to because of law. I'd more than likely find a different place. As a consumer I have a choice to make just as much as a owner. There are many things that are protected by law through discrimination and I'm glad these laws are in place. Yet that doesn't change the fact that these people's views won't change. You have to pick your battles.  My friend is mixed albino. Mom is white and Dad is black but just looks white. He got a job down at some lumber place and he left because they were all racist as shit. They paid great money but he just couldn't listen to that shit.   Don't get me wrong, this helps nothing. Being able to turn away people helps nothing. I just think that if it'd what they want to do then I don't want there service in the first place for fear of what shady shit they would do. Shit has happened to me many times before with restaurants, stores, and just other services. Fuck them though, I don't want their service.  I don't get why this is a hard concept to grasp, people won't like you no matter what the law says. Fuck them. I don't care if Billy don't want to change my oil, I bet Chris will. I bet if Billy had to change my oil my shit would be fucked up. Stop trying to make everyone like you. It will never happen. Times change and a better company will open. This is the real progress. The company that sees this shit and instead of wanting the law to change will instead invite all types of people into their business. This is growth, this is change. We can't change there minds but we can make our own."
