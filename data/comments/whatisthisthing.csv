whatisthisthing,3dyupn,iBeenie,12,Mon Jul 20 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"Also you shouldn't eat over something that you deem to valuable to stain. The host should either get over the stain (I mean for God's sakes it's a tablecloth, it's kind of meant for that) or keep it wrapped up in a box somewhere labeled ""Our unforgettable trip to France"" only to be looked at 3 times before they die and the kids inherit it and sell it at a garage sale for 2 dollars."

When I was pretty young (I want to say 10/11), my family was invited to have dinner at the house of a new friend if mine.  This was a new country for me and I wasn't great using chopsticks yet, but I did my best getting the fish from the center of the table to my plate.  I misjudged at one point which resulted in the wine bottle tipping over and splashing the dress of my friend's mom.  She was instantly upset and stormed out saying something about ""silk"".  I couldn't believe the lack of composure, but apologised as did my dad saying he'd pay for the dress.  From afar we could still hear key words as she changed, but I was really shocked and confused as to how we were supposed to react to the situation.  I kept thinking back to something my grandfather said to me when I was helping him in the garage.  ""If you can't afford to fix it, you can't afford it."" I remember the phrase every time something of mine is broken, every time I forget to save a file, every time I see a car parked across three slots, and most importantly...every time I'm entertaining.  It doesn't take much to realize guests are out of their comfort zone.  Why make it worse?"

But this is a tablecloth. It's not as if the guest was doing something he wasn't supposed to. He was at the table, drinking wine he was served. And the tablecloth served its purpose. The purpose of a tablecloth is to protect the table from scratches and stains. It is supposed to be washable and in any case easy and cheap to replace.

Have someone who knows how to test this find out if is true.  If it is go back to the electrical panel and switch off the breakers one by one to find out which one it is hooked up to. Look up on the panel door to see if it says anything. If you can prove it can be switched off at the panel you know the sensor for the alarm is on that circuit. Check if there is 24 volts, that would be good to know.  OK, eliminate a radon alarm, that thing is too old to be one. Fire alarm, I doubt it. Why? No fires.

This is because the metal contains a significant residue of glassy slag left over from the source rock, the forging process draws it into a pattern like wood grain, and the material under a slag pocket corrodes more slowly than nearby exposed iron.  If it lacks this structure, it was made with modern steelmaking methods, which began to be widespread in the 1860s."

(He was a skeptic like me, so neither of us actually believed it.)  He often got stacks of new $2 bills from his bank, and would pass them out as novelties, mostly to children, who almost without exception were duly impressed by them. (While they are somewhat unusual, they are indeed legal tender.)  His name was William, and one of his nicknames he earned was ""Two Dollar Bill.""

I suppose if you left it in the fire long enough it would melt, but most people probably won't do this. You remove it when you are done pokin' the fire.

When he gets home he realizes that the tool won't fit because of some stupid piece of metal sticking up and has to go back to Sears and find these similar tools with a hole in the middle. Joe will probably not return the normal torx set because he pictures himself using them later on in life and purchases the tamper-proof set as well even though the only tamp-proof torx they stock in stores are the socket ones that cost $35.

whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,NastyEbilPiwate,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:14 2015 UTC,I'd assume it would. Maybe some strength difference in to tools though.
whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,volcanonacho,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yes a tamper proof torx will work on regular torx. No there isn't an appreciable strength difference the limiting factor is more the ""lobes"" of the torx bit which tend to either bend or break outright.  They're somewhat of a funny development for the big world as they're designed to prevent ""cam out"" (the bits tendency to push itself out of the bolt rather than spin it) whereas Phillips was designed specifically to ""cam out"" to prevent over tightening on the assembly line. Now that torque limiting drivers have gotten significantly better more and more industries are moving to torx as it allows a more ""positive"" torque setting as it's far less likely to prematurely cam out and make a false positive."

whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,HaveaManhattan,9,Mon Jul 20 14:38:38 2015 UTC,This is correct.  Normally torx screws that aren't torqued enough can be removed with a proper sized flathead. The raised center blocks flatheads from being used to removed the bolt
whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,VolatileBeans,11,Mon Jul 20 15:20:46 2015 UTC,But it works wonderfully with a smaller screw driver. The pin holds a flat blade nicely if you go from star point 1 to star point 3.

whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,achievable_chode44,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:18:47 2015 UTC,you can wedge a flat-head in a standard torx but the rod in the center stops you doing that in the tamper proof ones.
whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,pigeon_soup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:33 2015 UTC,Cause it's not illegal to manufacture or sell those tools. So it's still tamper resistant you just need the right tool. You can buy a firehydrant wrench or lock picks for example. But many stores won't sell them since they're slightly frowned upon (and can get you in trouble depending on circumstance).
whatisthisthing,3dxmj2,notaneggspert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"tamper visible would be a better phrase. Twisting the screw will notch the head, and usually there is a paint seal on the screw."

whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,work_account11,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:41 2015 UTC,It should be able to be removed by turning it to the left.  If that doesn't work you can get a grinder with a cutting wheel and cut it off just be careful and it will probably take a couple of wheels and a grinding wheel to smooth it down whats left.  Also you can use a cutting torch.  and then grind it down.
whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,bigroblee,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:05 2015 UTC,It just turn around freely. Maybe I will cut it. What a waste.
whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,ProudTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:13 2015 UTC,If you end up torching it off make sure to put some wet card board around it and keep a hose handy so you don't leave torch marks in the concrete. that burn will stay forever.  and if you go with the cutting wheel approach you will need to secure it with something to keep it from wanting to spin.  you could probably back a truck to it and use a ratchet strap to put enough tension on it to keep it from spinning.

whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,ProudTurtle,4,Tue Jul 21 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"What a shame you have to remove it. A payee like that is sort of a hot commodity in some circles. If you find that you can't angle grinder through it or you don't have an angle grinder, a hammer and chisel should loosen that crack at the base to let you chip out the concrete. Then you'd have to get some cement to patch the hole. On second thought a cheap angle grinder might be $20 at a harbor freight or northern tool store."

whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,work_account11,4,Tue Jul 21 13:56:32 2015 UTC,you might be able to sneak a sawzall blade under the base if you have a sawzall. This might be easier than grinding it down as others have suggested
whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,jigjiggles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,this is the most logical solution... he can use a grinder to smooth it down if need be after he sawzall's it off.
whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,imforserious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:02 2015 UTC,I bet that would take a 100 sawzall blades.
whatisthisthing,3dzs8g,demux4555,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a bit of a pain.   Get a 4.5 inch angle grinder and a cutting disc (the thinner ones) to cut through the ring. Then I'd use a grinding disc (the fat ones) to slowly grind away at the base (and your sanity) until it's level with the concrete.   Definitely wear earplugs, a face shield, and suede gloves. Don't wear any fabrics with synthetic fibres. The sparks can light your clothes up and they'll melt right into your skin. Stick to natural fibres, ideally leather or wool, and you'll be fine. Also clear your garage of any flammable chemicals or rags.   Good luck!"

whatisthisthing,3dz89r,ItstheGodDamnCops,3,Mon Jul 20 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly. They use similar devices for moving road barricades. I'm not sure what the exact name is for the ones to move bricks. Honestly I lay paver bricks for a living and I just recognized it because we have one in back of our shop. I've never used it because we use mechanical paver installers that have a hydraulic clamp at the front, same idea as the clamp you saw, but more mobile and faster. Lemme do some googling real quick and get back.  Edit: it would appear it's just called a paver clamp. Construction can be nice and simple like that sometimes. Our two main machines are simply referred to as ""the installer"" which picks up and puts down pavers. And ""the screed machine"" which screeds the setting bed to make it level. Pretty straight forward."

You can tell it's a grey fox and not a coyote because the tail is longer and the black stripe runs the length of the tail. A coyote's tail usually won't touch the ground when it's on all four legs and there's only a small amount of black at the tip of the tail.

Also, it seems somewhat debatable that this model was designed to be a school bus, since it isn't really a thing here in France (most ""school bus"" services uses regular vehicles, with removable markings, there's no such things as stop arms, mandatory yellow color, blinking lights, etc.). The roof rack makes me think it was just a regular shuttle passenger bus, a frequent sight in french countryside where personal cars were far from omnipresent yet.

This looks like a different Kodak medium format camera, of which there were lots of different models.  The film is not really produced any more (although there are some places that produce it, it's really expensive).  Usually, cracks in the leather bellows and around the lens allow moisture to get in around the lens, causing damage to the lens that compromises focal clarity.  Because of this typical type of damage, even if you had the right size film for the camera, it probably wouldn't come out anyway (sorry).   What I find a lot more interesting than the camera is the tripod!  I see cameras like this all of the time, but almost never find the old tripods!"

This here is simply a beefed up RFID unit, similar to the loss prevention tags stores use on merchandise, but designed to work at a greater distance.  Toll lanes are usually at least 108"" wide (Federal minimum lane width), and cars using toll passes are approaching at up to 25 mph, sometimes faster, so the units have to have to be beefed up quite a bit to respond in that brief time frame and at a much greater distance than the merchandise ones.  If you think about it a bit you'll realize that RFID, like any other radio signal, follows the same laws of physics as the rest of the things in the universe.  The tiny RFID unit in your credit card can't respond from very far away, no matter how powerful the signal is, which is why credit card readers that use RFID need you to actually touch the unit.  The range is measured in inches.  Merchandise tags are bigger, and can respond from a greater distance, but even those  distances are seldom over a few feet (notice how close those detectors are that you walk between, or that are on either side of the doors).  It's the inverse square law at work."

whatisthisthing,3dv1cc,freckles42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:    A cezve is a pot designed specifically to make Turkish coffee. The body and handle are traditionally made of brass or copper, occasionally also silver or gold. Though, recently, cezve are also made from stainless steel, aluminium, or ceramics. The long handle is particularly useful to avoid burning one's hands, and the brim is designed to serve the coffee.  In the rest of the world, the cezve is known as an ibrik, which is also its most common name in the United States, just like in Romania. Ibrik is a Turkish word from Arabic `ibriq in turn a rendition of Persian a:bri:z - a:b water, ri:z (older rêz) a cup.[2][3] In Turkey, 'ibrik' has another meaning, it is again used for long spouts but used for handling liquids like oil and wine, not for brewing coffee.

whatisthisthing,3dqcsf,DishwasherTwig,27,Sat Jul 18 20:41:04 2015 UTC,thats copper sulfate. try not to get it on your skin. a nice bath with water mixed with baking soda will clear it right up. use a brush to get into places that need a scrubbing.   I just did this. Terminals look great.
whatisthisthing,3dqcsf,catfapper,4,Sat Jul 18 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"Clean them up before it leaves you stranded. You'll need a box of baking soda, a steel wire brush, a hose, gloves and disposable clothes.  Pull the terminals off the battery and scrub everything down with the steel wire brush. Empty 1/8 of the baking soda into a gallon of water and dump onto the battery. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there is no more fizzing. Soak the cable ends in the baking soda solution. If you have a serviceable battery, pry up the caps and add distilled water until the level touches the bottom of the tubes. Reseal battery. Now soak the entire area with a hose for 5 minutes.  This process can stain cement, chew holes in clothes and burn skin. Be careful. Wash hands and face with soap and water.  That corrosion will inhibit the flow of electricity from the alternator into the battery and from the battery to your starter. It will leave you stranded and promotes rust under the hood. Clean it up nice and shiny. :)"
whatisthisthing,3dqcsf,moresinsthanyou,4,Sun Jul 19 02:28:29 2015 UTC,"They actually make a tool specifically for cleaning battery terminals and the connectors. It makes it much easier to get a good scrub on them, which also results in you only really needing at the most half a gallon of the solution.   Baking soda is cheap, I make a solution with more baking soda.  Also, while adding distilled water to batteries is good, battery acid is also needed eventually, but by then it's probably easier to just replace it."

You would need a female to female d-sub adapter/cable - most likely crossed over  (oh yeah, the manufacturers love to make you order more ""special"" cables).

They're all decorative items produced for the mass market starting in the 1950s. ""The Circle of Friends"" may reference earlier, less commercial art, but don't be fooled by its pseudo-rustic appearance or the fact that some hippies may have bought it. It's from a time when decorative art in the US was all about appropriating themes from Other Cultures and adding exotic backstories. I'd bet that most people who bought early versions of it rightly expected that their friends would be wowed by their selection of a supposedly ancient and unique ""artwork""."

The trailing portion just looks like sea foliage caught on it but I think the bulk of it is just a carcass (or part of). Can't make out the shape but something that is dead and floating around a long time will become quite bloated between decomposing gasses and taking on water. I've seen a whale carcass floating in the sea that was this same color white and the part on the surface was heavily burnt/blistered.   Edit: digging for a picture of a dead whale I came across this which somewhat resembles the shape of this creature (seal). I'm guessing a baby or very small seal since 70cm is quite small.

These are deliberately written as official documents, with bits censored and in a style that suggests they are part of a bigger agency.   There are also fanfic stories that are written by the community, where certain characters in the organisation often reoccur,or are the story of how a thing was discovered or a fictional report of a thing escaping.

Google translate:     Established October 27, 1937, the Italian youth of Littorio (GIL) was fascist youth organization for the ""spiritual preparation, sports and paramilitary youth"".  Its creation was part of the educational mission of fascism, which he considered essential to devote more care to the education of youth through supporting social institutions, solving all the problems related to the school and expounding rigorous work in educational institutions, schools and educational. Gathered young people between 6 and 21 years old, previously from employees' Opera Nazionale Balilla and Fascist Youth Combat, and he reports directly to the secretary of the Fascist Party.  Under the motto ""believe, obey, fight"", the GIL organized children and young Italian in the following categories: for males, Young Fascists, Avanguardisti and Table; for females, Young Fascist, Young Italian Small and Italian; more Lupa for the Children of both.  Youth male GIL cultivated every military attitude, providing secondary education that prepared them for life in the Navy or in the Air. Instead, the young women were targeted courses of preparation to domestic life, in which the Italian girls were training to good housekeeping in those jobs that correspond to their skills and the practical needs of life that should have led.  Young people classified in organizations GIL were bound to the following oath: ""In the name of God and Italy swear to follow orders of the Duce and to serve with all my strength and, if necessary, with my blood, the cause of the Revolution fascist "".  In 1943 the GIL came to have over 8.7 million subscribers. Annually he organized the Ludi juveniles of culture, art, physical education and sport. Its significant housing stock formed long land dispute between the state and the anti-fascist organizations which it had seized during the Resistance."

whatisthisthing,3dnkzj,aberl,30,Sat Jul 18 05:12:42 2015 UTC,"Eastern Black walnuts (Juglans Nigra) are native to the U.S from Texas north into southern Canada and east to the coast. Juglans Cinerea aka Butternut is native to parts of the Eastern U.S. from Alabama to Canada.  Juglans Hindsii is native to a small area in California and Juglans Californica to southern California.  Other walnut species are Juglans Microcarpa and Juglans Major which overlap in range with each other and with Juglans Nigra in some areas.  Wiki has a reasonably good article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglans_nigra  To harvest walnuts for eating, wait until the walnuts drop to the ground, pick them up and remove the husks.  This can be done by placing them on a gravel driveway and running over them with a car, running them through an old hand crank corn sheller, or stepping on them with an old pair of boots.  Wear old clothes, they will stain anything that touches the juice.  It is important to remove the husks as soon as possible, once they turn black, the kernels inside the nuts will often be stained black.  Once the husks have been removed, place them in a 5 gallon bucket and fill it nearly full with water.  Stir the walnuts with a shovel for about 5 minutes, pour out the water, then re-fill with water and repeat the process.  Three or four washings should be enough to get most of the black stain and tissue off the nuts though some varieties may be much more difficult.  Place the washed nuts in a single layer on a table or a tray.  Direct sunlight will dry them quickly but can cause the suture to crack which can lead to problems later.  It is best to dry them outdoors but in the shade such as under a carport.   Be careful where you put them, squirrels will work for hours stealing your hard-earned walnuts!  Let the walnuts dry for about 3 to 4 weeks, then crack and shell them.  A hammer and brick can suffice for cracking and a pair of side-cutter pliers are effective at removing the kernels from the shell.  Shelled nuts should be kept in a sealed container in the freezer.  Walnut cracker: http://www.masternutcracker.com/  Walnut Council: http://www.walnutcouncil.org/  Northern Nut Growers: http://www.nutgrowing.org/  Source of trees to plant: http://www.nolinnursery.com/  If you are seriously interested in walnuts for timber or just for nuts to eat, please contact either the Walnut Council or Northern Nut Growers.  If you send me a message, I can provide other information sources.  Source: I have 50 acres of black walnuts planted for timber and an acre of trees grafted to selected nut producing cultivars."

Recently, I began a new project, and wanted to find more of these wheels. All I could find are the wheels seen in picture one. Literally. They were the only two of their kind present in the obscure model aircraft shop I finally found some in. I think the smaller ones even date back to 2006, since their pricetag as ""2006"" on it. They are the right size - I want two 2"" and two 1.5"" wheels - but are made completely of plastic.

whatisthisthing,3dqds5,nottyham,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:37:06 2015 UTC,It feels like elastic. And it's stretchy.  I looked on the bottom of the K cup and it would certainly fit through the hole made. I used a white cloth to dry and have never had this issue. Starbucks tweeted me and said they were concerned because it could have come from the cup. They asked me to send the picture and describe what happened. Glad they are working on figuring it out.
whatisthisthing,3dqds5,nottyham,4,Sat Jul 18 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm still pretty confident that this did not come from inside of the K Cup. If you look at how a K Cup is constructed here, if the piece of string was in the coffee grounds, the filter would have prevented it from getting through. It's possible that the string was in the space below the filter, but it's very unlikely that it would have made it out of that space during brewing. The hole on the bottom of a K Cup is not much wider than that string, and the hole is made by puncturing up from the bottom creating small jagged pieces on the inside. That string would have had to align itself in just the right way to come though that opening. Also, as u/brock_lee mentioned, ""...the tube that carries the coffee from the pod to the cup is thinner than a paperclip."" If the string didn't come from inside the K-Cup, it must have come from somewhere in the environment of your kitchen. Personally, I would have discarded the harmless bit of string, and moved on with my day, but hey... maybe you'll get some free stuff out of Starbucks."

The only thing that I can see that gives any sign of age is the art style and the patina (weathering/greenish color).  The patina indicates that it is at more than 30 years old as it takes time for that color to develop naturally and bronze busts/statues usually were not chemically patina'd. And the art style indicates that it is less than 500 years old. That's the best I can do."

whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,formerwomble,55,Thu Jul 16 15:00:40 2015 UTC,"I can add some information:  The metalplate inside and attached to the head is welded to the pole going into the base at the bottom. It's not forge welded, so it's at the most a century old. Probably post WW1 if I were to take an educated guess, since that's when arc welding really took off on an industrial scale.  This doesn't have to mean anything, since someone could have taken an old head and attached the plate to it much later, to make a display piece out of it. I can't tell from the picture if it's obvious that its tacked on later, or if its obvious that head was cast in such a way that it could be displayed that way.  The bit about the patina is correct, but. (And I am using the word ""patina"" now to mean signs of aging.) Any art dealer will tell you about patina, aging and distressing. That is, artifically age something and create the right kind of old patina for the piece. This is also done with bronze pieces.   I mean, you can buy old looking bronze pieces in Asia that are about a week old. Cast it, put some chlorides on it and baby, you've got a nice old green patina going!  Bronze can also have different kinds of patina, ie colour, depending on what kind of chemical you treat it with. Black, brown, white or green is common. This is creating the colour and look you want, which is not the same as making it appear older, I hasten to add.  Now, that was a long post, so I'll get to it:  This looks to me like bronze, which has had white patina on it originally (or atleast once upon a time). That's why you see a lot more green on the inside of the head, because it was not covered as thoroughly when the chemicals were applied to create the patina. On the outside you see the green colour starting to appear in streaks and spots.   The shape of the head, the eyes, and the level of detail is okay, but not great. I think the head got the white patina, when it was first sold or later, because someone wanted this to look like a classical white marble sculpture.  TLDR; Take it to someone who does this for a living and have it looked at."
whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,verdatum,9,Thu Jul 16 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"This looks to me to be a combination of chemical and simulated patinas.  Chemical patinas react with the bronze to form oxides, simulated patinas are basically paint.  It's pretty difficult to tell the difference between a chemical patina and a simulated one just by looking at a photograph.  So, they might all be simulated.  But if any of them was chemical, it'd be the green.  The tan and white colors are fairly clearly applied overtop, implying that they are painted.  When you apply multiple layers of different chemical patinas, they tend to mix together a bit more.  The fact that the patina is so uneven suggests that it is not natural patina; though with bronze sculptures, they almost never are.  After casting, one generally either seals the piece with lacquer to protect it from oxidation, or they intentionally apply patina, optionally followed by lacquer to prevent further oxidation.  The stand isn't just welded, that's MIG welded, strongly suggesting that the stand is post-WWII."

whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,cjwi,12,Thu Jul 16 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"make a model from wax. Cover wax in clay with reinforcing. (Or anything heat proof and mouldable.  Bury in sand (stops it from collapsing)   pour hot metal in the top.  The wax will pool out the bottom and hey presto you've got a casting.  Edit: I missed a stage, see below"
whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,Timmies_addict,7,Thu Jul 16 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  In lost wax, you take the clay coated wax and bake it in a kiln. The clay turns into ceramic, and the wax pyrolyzes into CO & CO2 leaving a completely clean cavity.  Then you pour the liquid metal into the still red-hot mold.  Also, the burying it in sand thing is often not needed."
whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,mayihaveatomato,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:37 2015 UTC,I knew it was something like that. Its been many a moon since my properties of materials lectures though where we learnt about different castings.
whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,raaaargh_stompy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't use clay. Clay has organic stuff in it and shrinks during firing. Lost wax typically uses ""investment"" plaster, which is a very durable silica based ceramic that doesn't shrink when fired. Also, most professional casting studios de-wax with steam before burn out / firing the mold, so they can recycle their wax. burning out large amounts of wax in a kiln (burn out oven) creates toxic fumes and a huge mess."
whatisthisthing,3dhxxl,AttalusPius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"Investment plaster tends to be used on a smaller scale. Ceramic clay is used on larger scale. when clay is used it is done as slip (clay and water) and allowed to dry before firing. the slip is used along with silica or sometimes zircon sand that reinforces and reduces shrinkage.  Regarding dewaxing with steam, yeah, that could be true these days. But not doing so is traditional, and the fumes are no more toxic or messy than burning a candle.  All the hydrocarbons of wax are able to cumbust into gasses. Nothing is left behind."

If you cannot find any markers for age it's probably not old and a replica of little value. But if you want to know for sure then only a lab can tell you.

Thought yall might like to know.  joshthemoore left you a message in your inbox:  ""Without looking at any of my notes or books and just going off what I see from the pictures. Here is my free opinion. If you find out different you can let me know if I was right or wrong. The base of this item is your deciding factor IF you can't find a makers mark. Without a maker's mark people will shy away from buying this due to the stand. The stand appears to be around 30 years old. If this item does have a makers mark the stand will hurt the value but not in the same way as without the mark if that makes sense. The mark means everything on a piece like this or a verifiable backstory as to the origins. This is due to reproductions, and artificial aging methods. My guess is it is a reproduction. I hope this helps. If you find a mark of any kind on this statue or any other items you can buy my gig and I will id it for you. If you want me to dig deeper on this you can buy the gig but I doubt there will be much more to find. """

I don't think this is that old because the head is hallow. This seems to be a replica made from some sort of plaster mold.  If it was very old, I would expect it so be solid because the original artist would carve it out of some sort of stone and making is hallow would be unnecessarily difficult.

I doubt it's for reenactments thought, considering I'm from Norway and I have never heard of any reenactments of Nazi activities here, also the helmet seems to be crudely made with a single sheet of metal, it got tons of imperfections on it with ''iron bubbles'' popping up at places, which wouldn't make sense if it was produced for reenactment only.    Also, I can detect rust on places where the paint has come off so it has to be from the second world war, considering it has been up in my attic for quite a while apparently.

whatisthisthing,3dn1yd,pipkin42,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:50 2015 UTC,The bayonet and helmet are not related.  They're different eras.  The bayonet is 19th century and the helmet 20th century.  The bayonet looks damaged.

whatisthisthing,3dn1yd,pipkin42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"But if you flip it over, doesn't that just make it on the right side?   I'm not trying to be snide - I really don't understand why the thing can't be used on either 'side.' As I understand how these worked, you slid them on and then locked them into place. Are they really 'sided' in that way?"
whatisthisthing,3dn1yd,AutismIsNotReal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. If i flip the mortise to the right side, the bayonet blade will be inverted of course, and that doesn't make much sense.   I did some elite paint copy and pasting, and you can see that the opening on the Brown Bess and my bayonet is flipped, so I can't just flip it over because as I've said, the blade will be upside down then.  Edit: I did some more googling and my brain couldn't imagine bayonet blades being upside down, I think indeed it's a Brown Bess bayonet but I still think it's weird that the opening is on the opposite side than shown in several pictures."
whatisthisthing,3dn1yd,AutismIsNotReal,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"Ohh, your pictures do indeed clarify things. Thanks for including them. I didn't realize the hole in your copy was part of a more elaborate locking mechanism.  I can think of a couple theories: One, weapons were not fully standardized at the time, so this could just be a variation. Two, maybe it was for a lefty? I don't like either of these explanations at all, but there you go. Maybe a military weapons expert can chime in more. I'm certainly not that."
whatisthisthing,3dn1yd,Crabbyab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"The first idea could maybe be true, I assume they used very crude ways of making bayonets etc. in the earlier todays and didn't have the necessary machinery to produce perfect copies.    The second idea might also be true, it would make sense considering it's flipped.    Don't know of any military weapons expert in Norway at least. But thanks for the tip."

whatisthisthing,3dkkc8,DimKingdom,3,Fri Jul 17 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't have residual radiation. It may have been exposed to some form of radiation, but it wouldn't have been in contact with actual radioactive materials.  As for ideas on what to do with it, it depends on the specs. It looks to me like it's designed for 120vac, and simply runs from 0 to 110%, like most variacs. If it indeed can handle 10 amps, then it's definitely decently robust. Units like that are often used to compensate for the local power being just a few volts too low or high for the intended device, maybe because the X-Ray machine is super sensitive to line voltage differences. It does a good job at boosting or cutting line voltage slightly, but it does so at the efficiency level of a transformer rather than a resistor.  Google is your best friend for ideas, but here's one: Build a rectifier using heavy diodes and large capacitors, making it beefy enough to take about 10 amps. Feed the rectifier using the variac, and add an ammeter and voltmeter to monitor it, plus a 10 amp fuse for safety. Presto, you now have a simple machine that can produce anywhere from 0 to about 50 volts DC, and can sustain up to 10 amps of load.  Bonus: use your new machine to charge up capacitors to 50 volts. Use test leads with alligator clips to connect a coin to each side of the capacitor. Touch the coins together to instantly discharge the capacitor through the coins. When using a big enough capacitor, you can actually weld the coins together from the heat of the arc."

Sometimes the time between Cellar and the next item is only 15 minutes or even less. Times are most frequently rounded to 5 minute boundaries, but quite often not.   Questions that occur:   do these events all refer to the same house? is the person recording the events the one doing them? are they cleaning? why else would they visit each room once, in a similar order? why do they clean every day?  why does it take 4 hours to clean a 1 bedroom house? :) why do they write the numbers 1 to 5 each time? It seems redundant why is 19 Sept out of order? how can the cellar take 3 hours on some days and 12 minutes on others?   EDIT  More oddities:   start time varies more (6:37-8:17) than end time (12:12-13:15) on Tuesday 23, the big gap is after room 2. Every other day it's after room 3. the big gap varies from 2:35 to 5:00.   And just an observation: if this is a cleaning timesheet, and it's AM, it seems weird to do the bathroom and kitchen first thing in the morning, when you'd be in the way of the resident(s). But cleaning at midnight also seems weird.  EDIT  More stats:  Excluding times when a room is the ""big gap"" (more than 90 minutes), the average times are:   Bathroom: 17 minutes Cellar: 27.5 minutes Kitchen: 25 minutes L.Room: 48 minutes B.Room: who knows?"
whatisthisthing,3dfc47,GingersGotSoul,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:11:38 2015 UTC,There's also only one instance of a correction--on Sat Sept 13. Looks like what might have been 6:32 (Bathroom) was changed to 6:37 and Kitchen was changed from something to 6:22. It's the only time the list goes out of chronological order.  Could there some significance here?  This may suggest that the order of the rooms was not set in advance or that if they were the order was flexible.
whatisthisthing,3dfc47,Frankenstooge,16,Thu Jul 16 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"Hear me out. Someone is being tailed/stalked. The cleaning list theory is reasonable, and granted it could be that. My opinion is that the time variances don't add up for that though. Notice how on one date, the time between the kitchen and the next room may only be fifteen minutes, but on other nights it's hours. Sure, maybe some nights it only takes a few minutes to clean the kitchen and other nights it takes hours. Or maybe someone is tracking someone else's movements. Some nights the person is just making a quick snack, while other nights he/she is cooking a full meal or hanging out and having a glass of wine/beer. Also notice how the order of the list changes from day to day with one exception it always ends with the bedroom(around the same time) when the victim is goes to bed.Notice that the time in the bathroom is generally 5-15 minutes or around 30 minutes. Not really enough time to clean a bathroom, but certainly enough time to use the bathroom and get ready for bed or take a shower. Of course there are a few instances in which the bathroom is a 2-3 hours. I suppose this could be a number of things, such as the voyeur losing track of the victim for this amount of time. Of course it may be a cleaning list, but I don't know... The fact that the rooms are always in a different order except the bedroom bothers me. I always find it's easier to work your way from one room to another, have some sort of system when I'm cleaning. A routine. A lot of the professional cleaners I know or custodians seem to do it the same way. Also, it seems weird to me that someone would have their house cleaned daily(but hey maybe rich people do that). The way the rooms change from day to day seems much more like the loose routine most people subconsciously keep in their free time at night. Dinner around 6-8, bed by 12-1. Repeat."

Again basing this entirely off my own habits, but cleaning my kitchen generally takes about the same amount of time give or take a half hour or so. There's much higher differential here. I do it once every two or three days, and it takes about the same amount of time. I can only imagine if its done by a cleaning professional daily it would take about the same time every day, certainly not 30 mins one day and hours the next. Again, though that's entirely my opinion. Like I said it very well could be a cleaning list, but I don't think it adds up entirely.   Also, anyone can and would keep such a list in their pocket(especially if it documents days/weeks/months worth of information). It's just convenient."

Why does it take 8 minutes to clean the bathroom on 9/16 and 2.5 hours the next day on 9/17?
whatisthisthing,3dfc47,tattmanndann,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that you might start in rooms that are unoccupied, or in rooms that need more attention than others. and for b) I would imagine that the room may have been messier on the following day. following that logic it doesn't make sense to me why i put $20 in gas in my car last week but nearly 40 this week. or maybe it doesn't make sense why it took me 45 min to mow my lawn with a riding mower but nearly 3hrs to mow it with a push mower. and when I'm stalking someone I keep track of when they leave there house. I'm not inside to see when their in the cellar or when their in the bathroom. so really for a stalker list this is pretty impractical. and I'm not sure why I'm arguing with a stranger on the internet. several people above have confirmed what the list is for. if I were wrong I couldn't give a shit less. maybe you are right, in which case, more power to you."

whatisthisthing,3dfc47,Yubbivapor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:13:20 2015 UTC,"I took a piece of paper and folded it in the same pattern and then plotted some things on each square that are similar/different from other squares.  A few interesting observations learned in this process:  The paper is folded in 20 equal sized squares at the beginning. This is very purposeful. Whoever did this wanted equal size squares since it is not really quick and easy to fold paper this way. The paper was first folded in half lengthwise and then half again lengthwise. for the wider part of the paper however, it is not folded in half first. It is folded in five equal parts (four folds). This takes a little bit more planning than just folding in half and then half again which would result in fewer squares and rectangular sections, not perfect squares. It would've been easier to fold the paper in half and then half again and then half on each side to make 16 sections but they would not have been perfectly square and would've resulted in a slightly larger rectangle when folded up all the way.  By folding this way, the list seems to have been folded into one perfect square in order to fit in a pocket or something. For each day it seems the list was re-folded into a compact square so that only the current day would be shown to write on.   It doesn't seem that 20 days on one page has any significant meaning other than each day is a perfect square which kind of points to the OCD thing.   If you observe each day, you can tell that the dates and the room lists were probably not written out at the very start (to later fill in the times) but written each day. Although all in the same handwriting, the order of the rooms sometimes changes as well as the way the date is written. Sometimes September is abbreviated ""Sep"", other times it is abbreviated ""Sept"". The fact that there are different orders and slightly different ways of writing the dates points a little away from OCD behavior IMO but I am not an expert in OCD of course!  The majority of the order of the room list and each section is the same - 12 of the 20 segments in the same order (Sept 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, and 25). Four of the other segments are in the same order (12, 17, 23, 26) and then two other dates same order (12, 17) and two segments different than all the rest (19 and 20).  The way the word September is abbreviated differently in squares does not correspond to the order of the room listed.   In most cases, the times related to each room on the list are in order from earliest to latest. But not always. September 13 the first two times are not in order as well as September 19. Can't tell for September 22 and 26 as those not visible in the image.   Not sure what all this means but perhaps someone else might come up with an idea that matches this particular kind of list making behavior.  Edit: skipped a word or two, edited to make sense."

whatisthisthing,3dfc47,RESPEKTOR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"It seems clear to me that these are end times, not start times. I base this on the fact that the time between 3 and 4 is always largest, and while 3 changes, 4 is always ""L.Room"".  [To prove this, you could take the elapsed time for each of the first three rooms, using both methods: I predict that the time variance will be closer to that of the bedroom under this method, than under the method that considers them entry times.]  So if the recorder is taking three hours to clean the living room (or whatever task they are performing) then it makes sense that they leave the living room 3 hours later than they leave whatever was room 3.  So, it's a list of exit times of rooms. The last two rooms are always the same, the others vary.  Why would the order vary? My best guess: because the natural order (B, K, C) means starting at the bathroom, moving on to the kitchen, and then the cellar (since this is the most common). A good reason for getting these done first is to get them clear for users, and so that if they are occupied, there is still other work to be done until they are free. So if either B or K is occupied, then the others are done first. Does this look realistic from the numbers?   BKC - 12 times. KCB - 4 times, bathroom occupied longer than cleaning kitchen took. BCK - 2 times, kitchen was occupied after cleaning bathroom. KBC - 1 time, bathroom occupied for less time than cleaning kitchen. CKB - 1 time, bathroom and kitchen were both occupied.   I'd say that looks possibly realistic.  This could be a stalker list, marking what times each room is last entered. Evidence against that is that each number is written once, without correction.  They never take a day off - this is 7 days a week, with the same handwriting every day, for 20 days. That suggests they are not an employee, not even a live-in maid or au pair.  This, then, is most likely a choresheet of a housewife or child, describing when they completed each task. This has a parallel with cleaners who clean and initial sheets for public restrooms - the time written down is always when they left the restroom, once cleaning was completed, not when they entered.  Whatever task it was, took longest in the ""L.Room"" which is most likely ""living room"".  [Pet peeve: ""OCD"". I don't think this term means what many of you think it means. When in doubt, consider instead ""obsessive-compulsive traits"" or ""... behavior"". Or just say ""obsessive"" or ""finicky"" or any of many other synonyms. OCD is a disorder; nobody using is here is likely qualified to diagnose it, and nobody on earth is qualified to diagnose it based on this one photograph.]"

whatisthisthing,3djfru,GrilledCheeseBitches,5,Thu Jul 16 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"This is a Tetragammaton Pentagram:   19th century occultist Eliphas Levi constructed this pentagram. It is commonly interpreted as a symbol of mankind, as many pentagrams are. However, it is a symbol of many things that unite in the existence of mankind, as is evidence by the variety of additional symbols involved.  Union of Opposites  There are several symbols representing the union of opposites, including:   The conjoined symbols of Venus and Mercury in the center of the image The sun and moon symbols to the right and left of the Venus/Mercury symbol The alpha and omega symbols above and below the Venus/Mercury symbol The caduceus, which is below the Venus/Mercury symbol and partially within the omega   The Elements  The four physical elements are represented here by a cup, wand, sword, and disk. These associations were common in 19th century occultism both through tarot cards (which use such symbols as suits) and ritual tools. The eyes at the top might represent spirit. While all elements were commonly assigned a point on the pentagram, the position of spirit was of particular significance. Levi himself believed point-up pentagrams (such as this one) to be good, with spirit ruling over matter.  Alternatively, it's been suggested that the absence of a symbol in the upper left (with the first syllable of Tetragrammaton) might represent spirit.  Astrological Signs  The idea of macrocosm and microcosm is that mankind, the microcosm, is a miniature reflection of the universe, the macrocosm. Thus, all of the elements can be found within mankind, and so can influences of the astrological planets. Each here is represented by astrological symbol:   Moon, Mercury and Venus in the center, as already described. Mars on the upper left point Venus (again) on the upper right point Saturn on both lower points Jupiter on the upper point"

The parents will typically push the baby out of the next before it's fully ready to fly, and spent the next few days feeding the baby on the ground until it's ready to take care of itself. She said if I really wanted to help it I could leave out some water in a shallow dish, but really the bird was fine on its own.

whatisthisthing,3dfkto,Super_Sic58,3,Thu Jul 16 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"Charlie was right, under bird law: Migratory Bird Treaty Act as of December 2, 2013 it is illegal to own a hummingbird (Selasphorus sasin).  I just didn't know enough to argue."
whatisthisthing,3dfkto,anelephantsatonpaul,2,Thu Jul 16 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"It is illegal to own, handle, or mess with nests/nesting sites of native birds, including native humming birds. The only species not covered are invasive species introduced from outside the US.  Pigeons, european sparrows, and starlings are the invasive species we have on the east coast that are not covered by the Migratory Bird Act (aka not illegal to own).  I dont know the laws involving importing wild animals from outside the US, never had to deal with that in my time as an Animal Control Officer. I know permits are involved but thats about as far as my knowledge goes for those laws.  TLDR; No, you cannot own a hummingbird, but you can own/raise pigeons, starlings, and european sparrows without permits."

whatisthisthing,3dfkto,Thalenia,25,Thu Jul 16 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"This is what appears to be a house sparrow! They are actually pretty independent once they have all their feathers and will spend their first few days hopping around looking for food before the fully fly. The best route would be to return him to where you found him, or somewhere nearby. The parents will hear him and come find him. If that is not possible, I recommend taking him to a wildlife rescue/rehabilitation near you! If you go that route, I would create a little nest out of toilet paper in something shaped like a butter container. He is most likely not old enough to be eating solid food. He will still mostly be fed by force feeding into his crop, which is pretty difficult and should not be attempted by someone who does not have experience."

We also have a large milk cap filled with water.   We have an event going on in town today and worry about returning him with all the foot and bike traffic.

whatisthisthing,3dfkto,I_poop_in_10_seconds,5,Thu Jul 16 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"This looks like a sparrow, so far from an endangered species. If you think it would likely be run over where it was, what can be the harm in caring for it at home? The worst that will happen is it will die and if you feed it often and keep it warm at night it might not. Birds produce lots of offspring because many don't make it. It's best to leave them where they are in general but I don't think you need to feel guilty about it. There are an awful lot of pictures of owls posted. Where do those come from? Do pet stores sell them? Enjoy your sparrow."
whatisthisthing,3dfkto,bizlur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"Yup, softened cat food is what I fed when I was doing baby bird feeding. I recommend chopping the pieces in half! I also used to feed them thawed peas (it's fun because you can see the green in their crop). And just shove it in there! I recommend using tweezers to feed them, I found it's a lot easier than trying to stick it in. Their crop is in the back of their throat.  Just keep feeding him until he stops asking for it (like the site says). Good luck!"

Back in the day, if you wanted to outline a block of the page or input a symbol, you used the appropriate key on the keyboard. Most everything was done by keyboard, the idea of the mouse had barely been invented. If you were lucky, you had an old Atari joystick or trackball for games that supported it (because they sorta worked).  In the modern day, pretty much all computers use the same ASCII character set.

I just googled and can't seem to find out exactly what it was officially called but I remember it was a lot of fun to play."

whatisthisthing,3d91ib,AtlanticSailor,25,Tue Jul 14 15:19:33 2015 UTC,"Likely Solved!  Toss-up between this answer and the yacht mooring buoy flag.  EDIT: I think the fishing net buoy is probably a better answer.  The large number (957) and the handmade quality make me think it's less likely to be a mooring buoy flag.  Also, the anchor symbol seems redundant for a mooring flag, but makes sense if you have several flags on a fish net and you want to say ""this one has an anchor.""  EDIT: So it was attached to a fish net in Lake Huron or on the western side of Georgian Bay, broke away during a storm, was carried by currents across the lake where it eventually ran aground on the island.  It rested on the rocky shore for a spell, being slowly bleached by the sun and dampened by the odd wave, growing pale and mouldy.  At this juncture our trail grows cold.  By whose hand was the broken flag moved from shore to hilltop?  Was it a kayak camper, stranded here by bad weather, driven to savage boredom on this barren island offering no diversions but bare rock and gnats?  Perhaps it was carried by a mink, gussying up his island abode to woo his lady love?"
whatisthisthing,3d91ib,Aplicado,12,Tue Jul 14 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent speculation, OP. Though might I suggest it was possibly carried aloft by seven sea-gulls in desperate wroth at the height of the '14 Rebellion against the Hegemony of the Eagles, once flying in proud defiance, once brought down by cruel claws and now spluttering ground-soiled, as the storm that raised it abates to a breeze, but never dies and ever gathers strength, not an iron-wind but a rock-wind, not fleeting as the rusting sword but patient as the greyspeckled daughters of Lava?"

whatisthisthing,3d91ib,Cheesius,18,Tue Jul 14 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"Where I'm from the number is mandatory. It's associated to the fisherman that owns the net. So when the ""fishing police"" (don't know the correct translation) finds a net placed illegally they know who to contact. Otherwise they just confiscate it.  The colors usually indicate in what way the net place according to the bouy itself, making it easier to pick up.  (I think i remember black to be east)"

As you can see in the satellite pic, the entire area is one enormous navigation hazard.  I'd guess that any boat with a significant draft (even a sailing dinghy with a daggerboard) might find it perilous.  It would be possible to anchor to the west and come in on a tender, though. Given the prevailing winds (WSW) it might be difficult to read the flag through binoculars from the west.  The islands are small, flat and rocky, so not really fell-running terrain."

whatisthisthing,3d91ib,iMarmalade,3,Tue Jul 14 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's a good idea, and close to my first thought, some kind of Swallows & Amazons ""Secret Water"" expedition.  It's a 15-20km paddle from the nearest harbours, and getting there involves a lengthy open water crossing that can be quite challenging/impossible if the wind picks up.  And you have to plan on being stuck there for extra days if the weather turns.  Possibly a very intrepid troop, in which case hats off to them.  I would have loved being marooned there as a kid."

whatisthisthing,3d91ib,Eastixk,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. All the moorings in a harbor are numbered, and authorized by a harbor master.

A storm could have pushed it up onto the rocks."

whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,onlyonejudge,5,Wed Jul 15 23:19:32 2015 UTC,This. It pumps water out of your basement if there's a flood.
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,talidrow,7,Wed Jul 15 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"Or, even if the water table is rising under the house, this will prevent a flood."
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,brock_lee,3,Wed Jul 15 23:23:25 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to keep your basement from flooding when there's a heavy rain or when snow is melting in the spring.   If the sump pump fails, then you'll have a flood.   And trust me, that's not a fun thing to deal with."
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,Reset108,3,Wed Jul 15 23:25:32 2015 UTC,Yup. The black thing is a float like you have in your toilet. This activates the pump once it reaches a set height. The long skinny pipe from the pump is going to the sewer outflow pipe.
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,ficuswhisperer,3,Thu Jul 16 00:25:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! My realtor was useless.
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,funkyfresh2,2,Thu Jul 16 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"If a realtor doesn't know what this is, they should be fired"
whatisthisthing,3dfwfu,ModemGhost,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Also, OP, if you decide to buy that house (or any house, really) get an inspection.  That sump pump is not set up very well.  First, the flexible plastic tubing shouldn't be used in the house.  Plus it looks like it's several pieces duct taped together, which will fall apart the moment it gets wet.  It should have a PVC line.  Second, many municipalities do not allow sump pumps to drain into the sewer.  Instead, you may need to route it out into the yard.  This prevents a ton of groundwater from unnecessarily going into the sewer.  Finally, having it plugged in to an extension cord draped across the room is not a good idea.  There should be a GFI outlet right there for it to plug in to.  Depending on code in your area, any one of these may cause the house to not pass inspection, which could jeopardize your financing.  I want to mirror /u/funkyfresh2's comment.  If your realtor doesn't catch this sort of thing, you need a new realtor."

Living in Canada I knew that they would not be enough to handle the snow and ice that I'm used to driving on, so i went out and got 4 Pirelli Winter (only tires) the change was quite noticeable.   The all seasons used to spin as soon as I tried to ease the clutch out to go (torquey diesel), i could feel it slipping out in corners and generally just didnt feel safe with them.  The all winter tires grip the ice when I ease the clutch out, i've only had ABS kick on a few times and luckily it was in town at low speeds.  I've been through many snow storms and general terrible driving conditions (when often times I probably should have gotten of the highway and waited it out) but I have 100% confidence in those tires.  I've tried to get it to fishtail while using those tires in the winter through a frozen parking lot and it was really hard to do with the combination of front wheel drive and the tires (even with abs off). At most I could get it into a handbrake skid"
whatisthisthing,3depye,pizzasteak,0,Wed Jul 15 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, constant slipping (warning lights flashed constantly going even 10mph). Mines gas, all season tires which I assume might be part of the problem. Honestly ABS scares the shit out of me, though I suppose it shouldn't.

So someone's relatives had a combination workshop and living room, which led someone to later make a combination kitchen and woodworking bench, in their grandparents' honour, or something.

Glasnost gave citizens access to historical government archives (similar to the ""Freedom of Information Act""), but the horrors of the Stalin years shocked the public. Perestoika was an attempt to give factories more autonomy (and responsibility) for production, but it was a shock to the system and shortages were frequent. Democracy backfired and paved the way for the oligarch ""Yeltsin Family"" to rule. as Lenin said: ""Liberty is such a precious thing...that it must be rationed"".

When water from a spring comes from a kakei, the tsukubai acts as an initial retainer for the water. Although some kakei do not continuously produce water, others do, as I think was the case here. This caused overflow in your tsukubai and rounded the edges. The excess spring water is usually then drained to a pond or river. I bet this one was next to a river and got washed down. Here are some examples: https://www.google.com/search?q=tsukubai&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=785&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCKHXlq7G3cYCFY-ciAodKqoDKw"

whatisthisthing,3db614,brutinator,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"People sell this kind of pin en masse in Russian cities — like this. As I understand it, most of them commemorate war victories, athletic events, anniversaries of important Soviet events, etc. For example, the one that says 1917 commemorates the founding of the Soviet Union, and was probably issued on an anniversary.  That little green one intrigues me. It says ""Izhorskii Taran — Green Belt of Glory"". Taran means ""battering ram"" which initially made no sense to me, but after a brief red herring with a region in Kazakhstan, I discovered the first word (which I couldn't read at this resolution) must be ""Izhorskii"" after finding this map. It shows the Green Belt of Glory memorial, built along the battle lines of the Siege of Leningrad. Izhorskii Taran is monument number 14 of this memorial, and if you locate it on the map you'll see the same symbol this pin depicts (the shape of the monument).  Digging further I found this site which confirms it does indeed mean the ""Izhora Ramming"". It turns out ""Izhora"" is a steel factory in Leningrad, so it makes sense that the Nazis would attack it during the siege.  Here are photographs of the monument.  I didn't find anything on the Izhora Ramming itself, but here's an English language description of working at the factory before the war. Although maybe something is lost in translation... ;)   I remember a funny incident. During rework drawings Sergei Abramovich asked me: ""Where will attach on the stove chute descent acidic slag?"" But the fact that the acidic slag during melting does not go down, he was even given to the filling of the previous heat."

whatisthisthing,3dbh6z,mrrp,6,Wed Jul 15 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"It definitely sounds like it's supposed to hold the pencil while it's being sharpened. My instinct would be that the thumb tabs would loosen some jaws within the hole in the sliding portion. You would put the pencil in place while holding the jaws open, pull back the sliding portion based on how far you'd want to sharpen the pencil, and then release the jaws and they'd clamp onto the pencil. Now you could sharpen one-handed! It's a little convoluted, but so were electric can openers.  If you can put a pencil through without doing anything with the thumb tabs, my guess would be that it's broken."
whatisthisthing,3dbh6z,Alnakar,9,Wed Jul 15 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"I had one when I was a kid. You're mostly right. It's an automatic feeding mechanism for he sharpener. The spring loaded jaws push the pencil into the sharpener. You didn't need to account for ""how far you wanted to sharpen the pencil"" as the pencil would stop advancing as soon as the point hit a stop just beyond the sharpening blades.

There is usually a button you have to hold down while you light it until the pilot generator is heated enough for the pilot to stay lit. Then you turn the valve to the on position. If it wont stay lit, you should probably let someone else fix it."

whatisthisthing,3dcmbt,pawxy,7,Wed Jul 15 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"I believe that's a PCI elbow card. It allows you to lay any kind of PCI card flat against the motherboard, as opposed to having it stand adjacent to it. Did you buy a compact/HTPC case?"
whatisthisthing,3dcmbt,evolost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"Its a u1 server chassis that I was sure was going to be compatible with my motherboard but this this came with the chassis and now I'm kind iof worried. So if I understand you correctly, it's just a PCI card that I can plug another PCI card into so it will fit in the (flat) chassis correctly?"
whatisthisthing,3dcmbt,Astec123,3,Wed Jul 15 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, they are actually called PCI Riser cards and designed among other things to fit larger cards into cases where they would not fit in the traditional way or to move a PCI card that would otherwise get in the way of an existing card that itself is an odd shape. In some cases you can also get ones with multiple ports for several cards.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riser_card  Wiki should be able to answer any more things about it."
whatisthisthing,3dcmbt,Astec123,2,Wed Jul 15 05:54:33 2015 UTC,I think it would be so I could have the card be horizontal rather than vertical since the case is so thin.  Makes perfect sense.  Thank you!!
whatisthisthing,3dcmbt,evolost,2,Wed Jul 15 05:56:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. A 1U case wont fit any cards in the traditional desktop manner so a riser card solves this issue. They can be quite useful for people outside the server world who are using a motherboard with limited PCI slots and who have for example a large graphics card/tuner card that would foul other required cards that need to fit in the case.

That said, I am fairly dubious of his claim that coating it with gold would change it. You need to understand how the sensor works. You can get a brief explanation in this video.  The sensor used is not a high-precision lab instrumment. It can get a fairly close gauge, but it cannot tell the exact alloy used or anything like that. For the gold plating to change the reading, you would need to add enough gold that you are fairly significantly changing the properties of the coin-- and with the value of gold being what it is, it is safe to assume they don't put any more gold in than absolutely necessary.  His aluminum foil example is flawed reasoning. The amount of metal in aluminum foil is substantially more than in a layer of gold plate. Gold is so malleable that you can hand hammer an ounce of gold to cover a 100 square foot area. Gold leaf can be as thin as .18 microns thick. Aluminum foil, in comparison, is typically 16 microns thick, so about 89 times thicker. So even if you could somehow apply the foil smoothly enough that it would pass through the slot and roll without causing problems, the difference in the metal you have added would be so dramatic that the two comparisons are worthless."
whatisthisthing,3d3y8z,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:52:16 2015 UTC,I am not sure if it's the same with American coins but in Canada they don't keep the magnetic properties consistent. There will be magnetic coins from one year that are not magnetic the next. There may even be multiple runs in a year that are different.   I think vending machines go by size and or weight.

You are no longer allowed to melt coinage for the purpose of making a profit.  You are allowed to smash your pennies, and turn old silver coins into spoons; you just can't sell them for more than the face value of the coin.  The reason for this is that the value of the metal in many coins is frequently worth more than the face value of the coin.  You can't go to the bank, buy $1m worth of nickles, melt them into zinc, and sell that zinc for $1.4m without running afoul of US federal law."

Other way around. You cannot sell US money for LESS than it's face value. You can always sell it for more. The issue with melting coins for melt value profit is just illegal because it was recently made so. The law on other forms of destruction of US currency says it's allowed so long as the intent is not to defraud or remove the currency from circulation (even if that's a secondary result). I make art with currency, in the process the bills and coins are destroyed to the point they're no longer useable for circulation. I've researched this quite a bit, and despite selling my work in public and people telling me I can go to jail, I am, in fact, still free."

It wasn't in a well organized location.  But, yes, you're allowed to turn coins into art and sell them for profit.  As you say, the only dangerous thing about manipulation is for the purposes of fraud.  In your case, you aren't selling the coin metal for profit, you are selling the artistry."

A salamander will have 4 toes or fewer, a lizard will have 5.  A lizard will have claws, a salamander won't.   As for what it would eat, the general rule for lizards is anything narrower than the space between its eyes, and shorter than its head, and doesn't bite back.  Usually has to be moving as well.  A pet shop that sells lizards will have small mealworms or crickets that should work."
whatisthisthing,3d9lsf,plaidpaint,3,Tue Jul 14 17:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think common wall lizard is likely right.  In Cincinnati they call them Lazarus Lizards.   The lizard got its nickname from the family that brought them to Cincinnati. George Rau brought back about 10 of them from Lake Garda in northern Italy. His mother was arts patron Irma Lazarus, and his step-father was Fred Lazarus III, who was president and chairman of the old Shillito's department store.  The young Rau had stuffed the lizards in a sock before boarding the plane for his flight home. He released them in his family's east side Cincinnati yard, and the lizards made their home in the stacked stone walls. They quickly adapted to life here because Cincinnati's climate is similar to northern Italy's. Source"

As I understand it, most of them commemorate war victories, athletic events, anniversaries of important Soviet events, etc. For example, the one that says 1917 commemorates the founding of the Soviet Union, and was probably issued on an anniversary.  EDIT: Oh god. This little green pin I get obsessed by is actually on this hat, a different whatisthisthing submission.  That little green one intrigues me. It says ""Izhorskii Taran — Green Belt of Glory"". Taran means ""battering ram"" which initially made no sense to me, but after a brief red herring with a region in Kazakhstan, I discovered the first word (which I couldn't read at this resolution) must be ""Izhorskii"" after finding this map. It shows the Green Belt of Glory memorial, built along the battle lines of the Siege of Leningrad. Izhorskii Taran is monument number 14 of this memorial, and if you locate it on the map you'll see the same symbol this pin depicts (the shape of the monument).  Digging further I found this site which confirms it does indeed mean the ""Izhora Ramming"". It turns out ""Izhora"" is a steel factory in Leningrad, so it makes sense that the Nazis would attack it during the siege.  Here are photographs of the monument.  I didn't find anything on the Izhora Ramming itself, but here's an English language description of working at the factory before the war. Although maybe something is lost in translation... ;)   I remember a funny incident. During rework drawings Sergei Abramovich asked me: ""Where will attach on the stove chute descent acidic slag?"" But the fact that the acidic slag during melting does not go down, he was even given to the filling of the previous heat."

I had the same LG VX8300 for almost 8 years and I never missed a call, had to reboot, clear cache, roll back an update, or even troubleshoot the thing. It just worked. I never even remember someone asking why I didn't get a text, because I always got the text (though that may have more to do with carrier).  Thing is, it's not really fair to compare smartphones to flip phones. In fact, I think we can all agree these are more pocket computers that make calls, not portable phones that do other stuff. Thing is, they evolved from phones, and were offered by phone companies, so that's how they're seen.  I have spent the past year bouncing around phones and carriers since updating to a smartphone. I've had all sorts of different issues. I can deal with them for the most part, but I do miss the days where I could just place and receive calls and not have to worry about optimizing things. But I suspect I couldn't really go back if I tried. All the current flip phones are total shit, which is why I felt compelled to cross over when they stopped making new OEM batteries for the LG."

Somewhat analogous to how Japan never quite caught on to the PC in the way the west did; it's not that they lack the technology, it's that they accomplish the same goal through other means.

whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,fluent_in_gibberish,3,Mon Jul 13 18:58:53 2015 UTC,I'm in iron mine country and can confirm that that is a bore hole left from a blast. The explosive charge is just big enough to fracture the rock so it can be moved and hauled for processing. It's very common for for pieces to be found with intact holes in them but the ones in the ore are crushed and processed. The ones you see in people's yards are almost always from overburden or waste rock that is hauled to a dump.  You have to remember that an average blast has hundreds of holes drilled somewhere between 20 and 50 feet deep with just enough charge to break up that layer of rock. If a larger charge is used we get all kinds of bad things going on like rock landing in the highways or windows being blown out in town.

whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,the__funk,3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"That is actually a very good idea that hadn't occurred to me.  There is a tremendous amount of coal mining that goes on around here.  Those could be from the boreholes they drill for the explosives, and these are the waste rock that they sell off for landscaping.   Edit: I'm going to go ahead and mark this Likely Solved.  Some basic research shows that boreholes of 6 to 7 inches can be used for blasting for mining, and with all of the mining in the area that is the most likely answer.  Thanks for the suggestion."
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,LBenDover,4,Mon Jul 13 20:05:40 2015 UTC,It's possible but it seems likely that if it was a borehole for explosives the rock would be fractured around it.
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,pala4833,2,Mon Jul 13 20:36:24 2015 UTC,The explosive was packed in past this rock. Then when the charge was set off this rock flew out of the crater.
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,RamblingWrecker,-4,Tue Jul 14 01:53:41 2015 UTC,....because that nice round hole would be left afterwards?  Your understanding of explosives seems flawed.
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,Maldevinine,2,Mon Jul 13 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on things like powder factor, stemming, lithology, brissance vs heave/gas, initiation pattern...  I don't work surface like the coal farmers (UG hard rock life), so I haven't seen it first hand. Another very likely possibility is that there is a rock mechanics lab nearby that has cored these out for testing. I had that job back in college."
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,plaidpaint,2,Tue Jul 14 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a common outcome. To get a fracture like this requires a weak plane above and below the section of drillhole, and for those planes to break apart during firing giving an outlet for all the expansion of the blast gases.  That said, a surface mine produces massive quantities of blasted rock, and so while they are not common, you'll see some of them after every blast."
whatisthisthing,3d5pp8,mrzippyz,3,Tue Jul 14 07:24:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm no explosiveologist, but I have definitely seen rocks with round holes left after blasting.    I've always assumed it's due to the charges being placed deep enough, and the holes spaced such that the fracture plane doesn't intersect all the holes.  Maybe if the goal is simply to break up the rocks, and not create a smooth surface afterwards?"

It's either mold or bug eggs, hard to tell from that photo. However, neither of those is something you want on your mattress. If the mattress cover is completely air tight, any sort of moisture inside it would cause mold, but I've never seen mold quite like that.   I hate to say this, but if I were you, I'd toss that mattress and get a brand new hypoallergenic one, and a brand new cover, and put the cover on immediately. Also, you do have a bed frame, right? If your mattress is sitting right on your floor, that's a recipe for disaster."
