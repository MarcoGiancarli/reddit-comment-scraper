Cyberpunk_Music,3e24pz,LaughingWoman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:32 2015 UTC,That section gave me NIN vibes. Good chillout song.

Cyberpunk_Music,3dqi7u,WeAreAllGeth,4,Sat Jul 18 13:50:46 2015 UTC,"Not exactly what most people on thsi sub would be looking for, but it makes sence. When I first heard Death Grips, I imagined it as the kind of thing that a group of 'urban youth' in a futuristic megacity would listen to arround a beat up hatchback."
Cyberpunk_Music,3dqi7u,Technoguy_at_1200bps,2,Sun Jul 19 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're very industrial and gritty sounding, but at the same time kind of psychedelic. I love it"
Cyberpunk_Music,3dqi7u,Technoguy_at_1200bps,2,Sun Jul 19 00:42:42 2015 UTC,/mu/    It's getting patrician in here.
Cyberpunk_Music,3dqi7u,xinx9,2,Sun Jul 19 02:09:30 2015 UTC,i think this one is more cyberpunk imo
Cyberpunk_Music,3dqhwb,3gaydads,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:03 2015 UTC,Off the excellent User Input album. Check it out if you don't know.

Cyberpunk_Music,3djkgb,coffeepunk,2,Thu Jul 16 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"I just released ""ghost process"" by I'm already working on another EP due out in October.  I still plan on going to work on my first album after that but I couldn't resist getting an EP together for Halloween.  “O-8015” will be released on October 13th, 2015. It tells the story of a Cadence Medical Service Android named “Olivia.” (Cadence is the fictional city featured in my upcoming first album). Something goes wrong with Olivia’s limited A.I. capabilities and they slowly become obsessed with the doctor they’re assigned to, but not in ways that you might think. That’s where things get really bad.  The EP will come with a PDF booklet containing stories that pertain to each track as well as artwork provided by the talented strawberrysuicide115.  This clip is a preview of the first track “GOOD MORNING.” I think it’s safe to say this clip does not refer to a particularly good morning."
Cyberpunk_Music,3dhqlo,orbitalfox,2,Thu Jul 16 11:03:53 2015 UTC,I love this. and it looks like there are 3 more parts by the same person. I'll listen to them all and report back.
Cyberpunk_Music,3dgux6,qtalll,3,Thu Jul 16 04:11:27 2015 UTC,"Have loved MN84 for some time now, great stuff."

Cyberpunk_Music,3de7je,ClaudeVanFoxbat,3,Wed Jul 15 16:05:28 2015 UTC,Great song from a great album.  So many memories involving this track!
Cyberpunk_Music,3de7je,handamputation,3,Wed Jul 15 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"The entire album is amazing, I had never listened to it before today (although I was somewhat familiar with Underworld). Really glad I did!"
