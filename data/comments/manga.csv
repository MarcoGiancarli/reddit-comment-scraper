There's a nice blend of romance and comedy to it, but it's the fact this has left me in tears of laughter that I rank it so high. It's a light summery of my opinion but it's 100% worth the read.   You might have heard of: Mahou Tsukai no Yome   A very cute manga with an incredibly fantastical world that I can't help but be immersed in. The characters also have a level of depth that's rarely seen, with each having serious potential to be very heavy on feels but handled delicately to not take away the focus.   I doubt you heard of: Rikudou   Personally, I feel this manga should have more traction. It's one of the few real-life fighting manga that make the punches feel legitimately heavy. There's weight behind the characters and the dark tone never makes me feel like a DBZ moment will happen. Victories are earned, not given.   Most likely never heard of: Koi dano Ai dano   This one... my god... I can't really describe how it is. All I can say is that it's unlike any Shoujo I've ever read ever and it's amazing."

That or maybe theyll see it as a checkpoint and decide they want to be the headliner for concert instead of an opening act.

I've actually realm liked the plot twist with fuuka and am interested to see where it goes. I wasn't really a big fan of Suzuka, so the fact that this kills its ending doesn't bother me as much.

I love that Suzuka is getting some conclusion, it felt so wrong to kill off fuuka with out any mention of how Suzuka and Yamato were doing, I hope we see both of them some time.  The conversation between those two felt a little awkward at points, but that may have been by design.   The whole fuuka's birthday is the same fell flat on me, but it explains why Suzuka was even there. It might have been better if she didn't know it was Yuu's birthday because the way she said it felt so forced. I felt like I would have been more interested if she just happened to mention it and Yuu had a small reaction. I felt like Seo tried to make it some big reveal.   However my Mother and Father had the exact same birthday and when I realized that it was amazing to me so I might just be underwhelmed because it's not new to me.  The art was very good this chapter, such an interesting choice of putting them under those trees and dedicating himself to drawing the leaves' shadows & sun's glare. They did seem like it was just a computer template, but it looked nice.  A lot of great panels this chapter, but I love the effect this page gives off. Seeing the subtle progression of Yuu's face really help solidify that Yuu is still grieving.   Seo is known for being slow so I'm not bothered by not getting much progression on the many strings he's opened. We got a new song and Yuu's decision to play the concert so I'm happy with this one."

Those are all by Mizukami Satoshi, by the way. They're all Sci-fi/ fantasy, though, and I don't know if that's up your alley. If you are looking for abililties, though, I'd say, of the ones I recommended, you'd go with Hoshi no Samidare, followed by Sengoku Youko, and finally Spirit Circle."

manga,3dzyyw,letsreview,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"Feel free to downvote this, but I think calling that site "" a batoto equivalent"" is a huge understatement.  Tencent pretty much has set up a microeconomy of sorts with that site,, not to mention all the animation projects that are currently underway.  While Batoto is a very community friendly comic site, tencent has a payroll system and their own animation contests (they do some ""episode 0"" type animations of popular manhua and let the fans vote it out, winner gets to become a 动画). Besides, 95% of that site is Chinese webtoons, not manga.  I've actually yet to come across a Chinese scanlation group friendly site (please PM me if anyone knows of one)  EDIT:it's not that tencent isn't community friendly or anything, but they clearly have a much more commercial mindset when compared to Batoto ( not that there's anything wrong with that, they've done a tremendous job of balancing the premium and free content)"

manga,3dxnou,xMongolian,24,Mon Jul 20 11:55:09 2015 UTC,"Narutaru was one of the most brutal manga I've encountered. I've seen many type of gore in anime, but more often than not, it has very little emotional impact and just look over the top. However, the brutality of some of this stuff made it feel so much worse...kind of like hearing some tragic story on the news that has nothing positive about them.   One of the most disturbing scene for me was  huge spoiler alert when the MC's dad find his daughter cut in piece in a trashbag after she went missing for a few days.  You can see the scene here, if you don't mind the spoiler of course. Visually, its not too bad, but its depressing as hell to think about, and the well written character (her father in this case) made it even more painful.   At least, you still have the anime OP to cheer you up, right?  [edit]  In case people aren't aware, Narutaru was written by Bokurano's author, which is one of the better manga out there in my opinion  (and the anime adaptation was quite good too if you ignore the ""anime-only"" ending). Narutaru's  isn't on par with it, the ending was unnecessarily convoluted, and too much ""shocking"" stuff, but if you enjoyed Bokurano style, it's worth try.  Just lower your expectation considerably before reading it. And if you never gave Bokurano a shot, and want to see a depressing Evangelion with more realistic kids, do that first. That one is great."
manga,3dxnou,Kaellian,7,Tue Jul 21 00:08:49 2015 UTC,Wait what? How the fuck does the story go on if that happened ?
manga,3dxnou,nevaritius,12,Tue Jul 21 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"Spoiler again obviously There is a rebirth later on.    Last part of the manga is honestly too weird. They went for something like evangelion, but it didn't work well, and undermined some of the tragedy that came before.  Bokurano was a much better manga by that author in my opinion, and its ending was incredibly more satisfying, even if I enjoyed Narutaru."

She's pretty much a stereotypical bully who bullies the smart girl in the class. The main victim who recently acquired power, was the one who sent the monster to kill the siblings in the youtube video.    The victim gets her revenge by getting the monster force the girls to ingest worms and raping the girl with its claw. Then she gets brutally sliced in half.   The manga is pretty fucked up, but it wasn't that good imo. It felt like it was gory for the sake of being gory, and the story gets really convoluted later on."

Same thing that happened with for instance Usotsuki Paradox. Two volumes untranslated but nobody has touched it in over a year... frankly this is probably one of the few manga series that I couldn't find more than 1 character I somewhat liked or found to be remotely realistic in terms of emotions and logic.

There's also no love triangle - not only is Nanami's role marginalized, she's never more than a character that had a crush on the protagonist, no hints that he might like her too - Shiina is the only love interest. Also right after the events of anime she gets into trouble because she isn't poor anymore or something and has to leave the dormitory. She gets on a bus and she disappears for the entire story. She gets like one scene before the end, where she apparently cut her hair to show that she's over the MC...  Second, they fuck. As in, Shiina and MC, right after they start dating. It's not very romantic or subtle. The MC in general turns into a horny asshole and is completely unlike the previous volumes or anime.  Third, they break up because MC feels Shiina will make him depressed, because she's too talented and he'll feel bad in her shadow and grow to resent her...  Fourth, they meet again right after they graduate from UNIVERSITY. Yeah, a fucking time skip. And they immediately get together again, say their love is stronger than before, yada yada yada.  tl;dr it got a lot more boring and pointless, new characters served no purpose and it's one of the cases where adaptation is superior to source on many levels. I don't think you'll find a translation of the last volume, everyone dropped the project."

Both have ridiculous amount of gore, ""good"" characters dying left and right, scenes of torture, rape, sex and gruesome violence where you just cringe at what next the author will do to shock us.  Oh, oh, and Deadman Wonderland, but at least sometimes it has comedic elements to balance it out. For example, one of the chapters has a girl lose in combat, so she has to donate an organ as it's customary for the loser. Protagonist's ally hacks the system at the last moment and changes the result of her donation to ""hair"" which is arguably better than losing an eye or a kidney, since if I remember it's done without anesthetics or painkillers.

Now the oldman has to add a hour to keep the balance. Otherwise It'd cause ripples and freaky shit to happen in spacetime.   If this was true I'd speculate that the Queen found out about this conservation of 'time'. Since she was getting old and starting to have wrinkles, she'd have to find a way to be young again. So, the Queen demands Eide to take years of her life, but Eide has to become the equal amount of years old to achieve this(I know I am making it sound easy but I guess there is a special process etc. just speculating). Eide must do it of course. After the deed has been done or Eide has outlived his usefulness. The Queen throws him into prison, aka the Oldman. I think the Oldman wants to take the years back, so he can be young again.   To add to this is that Elen shown in this chapter must be the girl the cast met a 1-2 chapters ago. I think she traveled either further or backwards in time to help/warn/be reunited with the Eide. I guess it'd be an effect of the Queen making herself younger process."

manga,3e0kkp,_amazingBastard,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:45 2015 UTC,The old Tokyo Pop went of out business during the recession. Everything they used to print is out of print other than the few rescued series. It is lucky that the 12 volumes are pretty cheap though. Tokyo pop volumes can be in the 100 dollar range.
manga,3e0kkp,shwag945,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:53 2015 UTC,Really? Because if so I just hope SGT. Frog isn't as pricey.
manga,3e0kkp,shwag945,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:37 2015 UTC,It depends on the popularity of the series and how many volumes were printed before the end of Tokyopop. For example the last to volumes of the hardcopy omnibuses of Battle Royal are extremely expensive.  v.04: used starting at $96. New Starting at $140.  v.05: used starting at $250. New starting at $525.  A series like Blame! also has used and new starting prices going from 15-130 dollars.   In addition for a lot of series in general good condition new tokyo pop series are really expensive even if used or bad quality new volumes are cheap.

manga,3dytty,inanimatebananamint,4,Mon Jul 20 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yanderes challenges the common practices of modern medicine, as we saw in the last chapter's hand-slicing event. Also, as we saw in this chapter, yandere reaction times are unparalleled. All this leads up to my assumption that the hair pin hit her eyelid as she blinked in defense, which would also explain why there was so much blood (since eyes are filled with aqueous humour and wouldn't necessarily bleed like that).  It was already answered, but here's a response straight from Divulge Scans:   There’s still the bonus chapter, and also six chapters of NicoChuu (which focuses on a different pair at the same school), but for now please enjoy this explosively heartwarming finale."
manga,3dytty,Abedeus,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:41 2015 UTC,NicoChuu   what is that and where can I find that... or is it yet to be release..  -thanks..
manga,3dytty,inanimatebananamint,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"It is a side story that was bundled with the physical release of Love/Death. Divulge Scans is working on it:   The LOVE/DEATH tank finally arrived and, as we were hoping, it included Kuzushiro-sensei’s wonderful NicoChuu series. The best way I can describe NicoChuu is to say it’s like taking LOVE/DEATH and flipping it inside out.  Anyway, it turns out these two series actually overlap a couple of times, particularly in the bonus chapter—meaning we really have no choice but to pick up NicoChuu too.   Also, for anyone wondering what order they'll release them, the chapter listing in the physical release has Love/Death 1-7, NicoChuu 1-6, and then 'Extra Episode'."
manga,3dytty,inanimatebananamint,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. But from the comments it seems there's an extra chapter that serves as an epilogue for this series and another, not scanalated/translated one (that the group might pick up, I believe) and therefore won't be released until the other series is fully released as well."

I also absolutely love the closing lines and what that implies.  For anyone wondering, this is the final chapter but the volume it released with has a bonus chapter and a side-story set in the same school! Also, Kuzushiro said the series might continue if it sells well, so do what must be done!  Thanks to Divulge Scans for all their work on this series!"

manga,3dxrwk,shady8x,3,Mon Jul 20 15:27:09 2015 UTC,The beginning isn't very good(I mean it starts like a typical fantasy story with actual fantasy giants... and takes like 50 chapters to get to the battles that make this story stand out) and anime adaption is horrible.  Great combination to drive people away before they get to a point where they realize how great this story is.
manga,3dxrwk,MyAwesomeAfro,40,Mon Jul 20 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Kingdom has to be one of the most satisfying, consistent, well written manga I've ever had the pleasure of reading, every single chapter drags me in more to the point I'm checking here every single day just in case a new chapter is thrown up early.  I care for the characters, their aims and desires. I give a shit about the balance of power in the world, the dream of unification. I remember poignant moments in previous chapters that still hang around with me now.  It's rare you get a manga like this, Berserk is about the only competitor Kingdom has in terms of rich, grand storytelling combined with some general badassery.  Huge thanks to Turnip Farmers for giving me my weekly fix."
manga,3dxrwk,TitanBlueprint,4,Mon Jul 20 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you. Even compared to all-time great manga like Berserk and GTO, the pleasure I've gotten from reading Kingdom is significantly ahead of any other I've read (though that may be in large part due to Turnip Farmers' biweekly releases of 3 chapters each a year and a half ago).   Excellent dialogue (thank the heavens a great group like TF picked it up) and commentary, captivating characters, incredible art (past chapter ~110), etc. Best of all, I think Kingdom does an unparalleled job between straddling the lines between shounen and seinen. You definitely get some dark and gruesome scenes, but it's excellently balanced by the heroic, inspiring victories by the protagonists."

manga,3dxrwk,FailerQt,8,Mon Jul 20 12:47:59 2015 UTC,Even if History doesn't it makes sense for this story. The six generals waging war and conquering whenever and whatever they want will speed up the process of conquering China alot instead of a General having to wait for word from the capital.
manga,3dxrwk,drumkn0t,6,Mon Jul 20 13:09:21 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly they did not exist.  E.g 2 or 3 of the previous 6 were probably 1 actual person split up into 2 or 3 characters  http://forums.mangafox.me/threads/477476-The-Ultimate-Facts-Thread-on-Kingdom-Characters  The characters of the old guard existed in some form or another but female characters in the story were probably males in actual history.

He's no good at cooking, so they've been eating packaged meals from the convenience store. A series of events lead him one evening to a restaurant run by the mother of one of his students, Kotori. Her mother isn't there, but Kotori does her best to feed them both. It turns out that Kotori is often alone, since her parents are divorced and her mother is frequently not around. The three of them begin to meet and cook tasty food together.   One of CR's recent licenses, they released the first three volumes within the last week or so. Previously, this series was being scanlated by Maigo, who had released 2 chapters, but it looks like they dropped it.  If I had to compare this with something, it'd be Koufuku Graffiti. There's not much drama, and the main theme is how food brings people together. The possible teacher student romance takes a backseat to family. Plus, recipes!"

If he wanted to use the armies and metal vessel holders to attack neutral states and build an empire they would refuse to help.  If Kouen had pretended he was okay with coexistence with the seven seas alliance at that peace conference Sinbad would have had a harder time convincing them to launch a preemptive strike.

manga,3dxxy0,Asthariel,23,Mon Jul 20 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"Can you really say Sinbad is the villain though?   The Kou Empire's entire strategy is world peace through world domination. Sinbad's strategy is world peace through alliances and understanding Sinbad offered the chance of peace without war to Kouen at the Summit - his only condition being that they must cut ties with Al Thamen - ya know the people who really want to bring about world destruction. Kouen refused Again the Kou Empire is basically the pawn of Al Thamen and Sinbad offered his help in eradicating them from the Kou Empire - Kouen refused, even after admitting that he knows that they're just a pawn. Even Riem sided with Sinbad against the Kou Empire   Sure Sinbad is sneaky and plays dirty sometimes... But can you really blame him when the enemy is the world's enemy?"
manga,3dxxy0,heathersaur,16,Mon Jul 20 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"He just backed up in a war young sociopath who brainwashed pretty much his entire army. You can even see of faces of his followers that they are not happy with his decision. Not to mention that there is A LOT of ofreshadowing that he will end up as antagonist.  And good! Villainy is the only way Sin can stay being interesting in this manga - after all, if he is strongest man alive he has to be a) a villain or b) dead, and he is too cool to die in vain."
manga,3dxxy0,Asthariel,6,Mon Jul 20 15:26:51 2015 UTC,So you're saying he should have taken the moral high road instead of taking the chance to strike at both of his enemies at their weakest?  Edit: Also there is a theme of no one is pure black and white (good or evil) but instead are more grey
manga,3dxxy0,heathersaur,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"But am i blaming him here? The act of attacking Kou perhaps isnt villanous YET, but it can certainly be seen in this light when we think about plot and foreshadowing of the series. Sinbad WILL end up as antagonist (not Big Bad, and im pretty sure he will regret it and sacrifice himself heroically in some way), so any morally questionable act he commits from now on can be judged to be villanous or merely pragmatic.   And about foreshadowing - i mean, do you read prequel about him?"
manga,3dxxy0,Asthariel,10,Mon Jul 20 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing a lot of the appeal of Magi. The point is there is very little that is good or bad - with Judar being an exception, everyone is simply doing what they think they should. Both Hakuryuu and Ren simply want the kingdom at peace - Hakuryuu wanted it free from Al-Tharmen, and Ren wanted peace through domination.  This isn't Sinbad being villanous, this is Sinbad being pragmatic. He's got a chance here to completely engulf one of the three largest empires into his own, and defeat Ren - the closest thing he has to a rival - while drawing Hakuryuu completely into his debt. If Sinbad wants peace subsuming one of the most powerful and warlike of the countries into his own, to be ruled essentially by him, is a good way of doing it."
manga,3dxxy0,Freddichio,4,Mon Jul 20 16:31:23 2015 UTC,"Backing up Hakuryuu isn't bad at all. First of all, yor write him off as a lunatic, but while Hakuryuu's definitely taking a more evil stance on the matter, it's because he wants to regain his rightful throne and pretty much every single character that could be considered ""good"" was going ""yeah.... nah."" even after Kouen and the others admitted they're wilful pawns of the certainly evil organization and even after he defeated Gyokuen and revealed she was an usurper who killed the king and the 2 heirs.   Pretty much everyone knows by now Hakuryuu was right and he has the right to the throne, while the pink haired brothers not only were siding with the only definitive bad guys, but their ascendance to the throne was also unlawful and they have been subjugating other cultures by force, crushing their traditions in favour of their ugly Chinese architectural style and imposing slavery and serfdom through fear and oppression. And what if Hakuryuu brainwashed his army? It was his biggest chance, or would you suggest he lost? He wants to win obviously, and militarily it was actually a very smart choice. Anyone in his position, with his goals, would have done something similar.  Also the only thing I saw in Sinbad's follower's faces is that they are serious and decided because they're about to go to war, not that they're doubtful or mad at him."

Right now Ill Ilah is the only thing that I consider to be important in the final stretch of Magi. Is it something about creating peace in this world or is it about defeating Ill Ilah so that he doesn't destroy other things anymore? How are they gonna defeat it?

manga,3dxxy0,guppywastaken,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"3 things.   The existence of the multi-species soldiers in the Seven Seas Alliance leads me to believe that the magic forcibly changing Alma Toran species into humans is being counteracted by the household consecration, or is simply an effect of constant breeding within enclosed populations. For all intents and purposes, cat ears is one thing on a human, eagle/lion faces is another. Ren Gyokuen dying doesn't necessarily imply Arba's out of the picture for good. It also doesn't mean the hole above Magnoshtatt is fully closed, meaning that Ill Illah could be brought down at any time, so long as Judar and Hakuryuu are close to each other. They've amassed a massive quantity of black Rukh. Sinbad, having halfway fallen already, is a dangerous ally for Hakuryuu, and his utopian ideals are still sketchy. Yunan doesn't trust him, and I'm going to side with him, if only because Yunan has such a wealth of experience. Something's up, and I believe Alibaba will come to expose Sinbad's nature in time."

Arba didn't just die, she blew up her magoi so unless she had some way of pulling back together she's basically out. Judar might bring down Ill Illah but that doesn't really go in line with what Hakuryuu wants to do. Sinbad mind controls people like Hakuryuu so they can bond over that I guess."

Supporting Hakuryuu will basically put an end to Kou's evading and conquering of other countries - something that the Seven Seas Alliance is purely against. Essentially this made Kou the world's enemy (why would any country want what was done to Balbadd done to them?)  Second a weakened Kou means that Sinbad can go in a eradicate Al Tharmen. Sinbad offered this as a chance of peace at the Summit to Kouen, to which Kouen even admitting to knowing that they needed to be gotten rid of. But Kouen refused. Not only because accepting Sinbad's offer would mean he would have to give up his ""ideal world"" (one that was completely dominated by Kou) but probably also out of stubbornness, ""this is our problem and we'll deal with it on our own"".  Even now Sinbad is going to Balbadd to try to talk first, not outright attack.

Just to give a bit of info on Sugar, if I remember correctly, it's not a cohesive story but various mini-stories throughout it's life span based around female leads in high school. Very cute and very fluffy.  On the note of the art though (which is what I immediately recognized), if it's what you're interested in, the artist, Mika Yamamori, has done several manga before.  Her most recently completed is Hirunaka No Ryuusei and is currently working on Tsubaki-chou Lonely Planet. Recommend both, though it's yet to be determined the direction of Lonely Planet with the chapters currently released."

manga,3dykl6,wingsday1,7,Mon Jul 20 16:13:44 2015 UTC,Both of them are worth it I guess. The anime has a lot more stunning visuals and looks so amazing your brain basically melts. While the manga focuses more on the story and fleshes it all out a little more. The con of watching the anime  would be that some people find that the story is a little too fast paced and doesnt really grab you (In my case it did). The con of reading the manga would be that basically the anime has extreme visuals while the manga is a manga.  In my case i watched the anime first (as the art and all is basically why people find it amazing) and read the manga a few months later. Both of them were worth it.  Hope this helps!

She's seeing for the first time how predatory her race is towards humans, instead of seeing them as livestock for a food supply, she's going through a transition of change that will likely be the start of some plot progression not focused on romance.  She'll of course understand the fact that it's about the survival of her race and preserving it. Integration is very possible of course, hundreds of years down the line of mixed breeding they might evolve and no longer have to rely on humans to survive, and because of that, the original ('pure') race could just as easily go extinct. (Because of the mixed blood the ""pure"" breed of Vampires can't get energy from them and slowly begin to die off.)  I'm interested to see how the rest of the story goes."

manga,3dxz3n,kulturtraeger,3,Mon Jul 20 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"Guys, I said it before and I'll say it again: Mari is schizophrenic or something and is just thinking she is the hikikomori dude 'residing' on her body because of some huge ass trauma she had as a child who broke her (Maybe adopted because real parents die?). The 'mother' said already that this is not the first time that she had that kind of weird behaviour. Think in how the author previously protrayed some bits of 'Aku no Hana' from Nakamura's perspective. (Another 'broke' character of his)  The apparent nonsense and difficult to understand what is going on at some times, get explained when we think that we are told the story from the point of view of a person who is not right in the head. Julio Sabato's ""The Tunnel"" is good example of this kind of narrative, if you are intereseted in a very good read."

The real dude, never actually said something like that ever happened.

manga,3duh1x,galactic_punt,19,Sun Jul 19 19:54:09 2015 UTC,I think it's in poor taste to sit in a bookstore for hours and read an entire book or magazine.

That's why they have couches there after all, isn't it? If it comes down to reading and not buying vs not reading and not buying anyway, there's no difference as far as the bookstore is concerned.

I stepped back and he put back a copy of the latest volume of AoT ... one that he was clearly reading while on the toilet. Disgusting."

It would get worse by the ""manga cows"" we dubbed them.  A group of teens that would grab dozen books or so and plant their ass in the isle reading.  When they put them back it was always on the lowest shelf, never back where they found it, with curled back covers.  I use to chase them away but others allowed it.    I don't work there anyone but my local book store is agressive with their books.  I hate it.  One lady (I asked if they put a security sticker on a page if I could return it, they did it once and I couldn't get it off) began to flip the book, fan the pages, pulled back and broke the spine, shook the book by the cover before rubbing it on a dirty counter causing scratches on the back side.  I was so furious when I left.  My husband couldn't calm me down.  I literally pulled over, found a tree, and punched it.  (Anger issues just a bit)  Then I wrote an email to the company.  I hate people man-handling my books.  I take pride in my massive collection."
manga,3duh1x,NetSage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:21:19 2015 UTC,I hate those damn security stickers. Once in a blue moon I'll find one on a page. No trouble peeling it off (I search for these before I buy them) On the inside of the cover? Fuck that. I tried taking one off before and it leaves this super sticky residue. I tried goo-gone and after an hour I eventually got it off. The downside was that I had to use so much goo-gone that it bled through the cover. It faded (but not completely) eventually and the cover feels fine at least. No way in hell am I trying that again. It was infuriating.

manga,3dx7xo,henryfc,2,Mon Jul 20 07:45:13 2015 UTC,IMO the manga is ending in a good spot. I'm not sure it could drag  the story much longer (also the author probably wants to end it).  I just hope the ending is as good as the rest and that it doesn't feel rushed like the explanation for the time traveling stuff. With only 2?(not sure how many) chapters to round up the manga.

Do you think you'll win the lottery? You'd like to think so, we all would. But Sumida is different. He wants the status quo to remain in every way; live a normal life, get a normal job, have normal kids, never to be anyone fortunate or unfortunate, content in normalcy. Anyone who doesn't agree is foolish, doomed to live their life scraping up a mountain that they can never conquer, fated to die in despair wishing things had been better.  When his mother kicks his father out of the house and onto the streets, he thinks he'll be fine. When his mother leaves him to live with her boyfriend, he makes the best of it. When he realizes that he's no longer average, he strives to make his life worthwhile the only way he knows how. When the demons in the back of his mind speak to him, he tries his best to ignore them.   A pretty dark Manga and it kinda reaches a lvl of Oyasumi punpun but overall its a really good manga it doesn't fuck around and tries to hard to be realistic and even if you know how it will ends you are still hooked how the MC will do."

manga,3dw2dx,Drakendrengi,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:56 2015 UTC,Like I know Uncle is on the way and Immortal Phoenix is strong but damn this looks so hopeless for them. Ah Gou is so outclassed and there isn't enough Dark Ones around to pull off the same Soul trick he did with Shen Yen.

manga,3dw2dx,good_vibes_all_day,6,Mon Jul 20 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"iirc Some citizens of Wan Qu back after the nothingness arc were like ""Did you notice savior has.."" and the other one was like nevermind that for now.

manga,3dvh0n,SkitZoFrenic,15,Sun Jul 19 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"I really like this series, that's why it still hits me hard whenever someone brings up the ending. I honestly thought Chihiro and Keima were mean to be and OTP and stuff, but in my mind Tenri, Ayumi, Chihiro, Haqua, and Shiori were fighting for Best girl status. That's why I cried like a little girl when I got to the last part. Jesus, I was just trying to decide which girl was the one I liked the most and then you come up and hit me with all that shit at once.   They forgot Haqua, Tenri got Kaneki'd, Dokurou's goodbye. That was too much for my confused heart to handle.  TL;DR: Too soon, man."
manga,3dvh0n,denunciadolince,0,Mon Jul 20 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"Don't really see how Shiori was in the running to be honest. She herself questioned why she and everyone else liked Keima because he just seemed to be a player in her eyes. While she was conquered by him, I think ultimately she didn't really want to be with him."
manga,3dvh0n,roboctopus,11,Mon Jul 20 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"You bring up some good points. I know there was a crazy shitstorm when Chihiro won, but it always really confused me. She seemed like she was the obvious winner from pretty early on. She even gave Keima problems in her first arc, after all, and after the Goddess arc she was obviously the clear favorite (and Best Girl).  Best Girl won. Mangaka be praised."
manga,3dvh0n,roboctopus,4,Mon Jul 20 00:58:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure people just thought Tenri should be the one he ends up with given the final arc and all. Chihiro x Keima otp, though."
manga,3dvh0n,DirtBug,13,Mon Jul 20 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people also thought Ayumi had a real shot (Maybe due to the wedding scene?)  I think what a lot of people didn't pay attention to was Keima himself, and how he reacted to things. He was clearly shaken up by Chihiro every time. She always put him off his game, and when he realized she liked him totally independently of some capture and he had to turn her down, he was obviously really distressed by that.  So for me, Keima's reactions to Chihiro were what mattered. He described her as a background character with few defining characteristics initially, but in a dating sim game, the MC also is usually a character with few outstanding characteristics, so I kinda think Chihiro was built from the start with female MC specs, and Keima ended up on her route despite his best efforts.   Chihiro was the female MC, and she won."
manga,3dvh0n,HipsterMe,10,Mon Jul 20 02:12:58 2015 UTC,I was rooting for Ayumi though. And I thought she won after that 'marriage' thing. Also helps being the first girl and a sporty one a that.

Even after reading it so long ago the number one scene in my mind is when the 2B Pencils play and everyone on stage is a goddess except her and she starts crying. Then it shows Keima in the park apologizing and crying as well. Memories of a first love. Powerful shit, just powerful. I didn't really hate any of the girls, but some were more memorable than others. I will say this the last arc.....seemed to drag on for so long.

But I think that new RC cells streghten body and not kagune, because they replace old cells with new ""augmented"" ones. You could say that human cells are replaced by ghoul ones.  Uri says: ""The damaged muscles repair and become stronger..."" and doctor tells him: ""The more of those pathways you have, the more you can increase your physical abilities."" Also as you can see, thanks to this, Uri is able to lift more. I'm almost certain this isn't about making kagune stronger.  My English is poor so I'm not sure if you understood what I wanted to say.  Edit: typo"
manga,3dtonf,Badname419,8,Sun Jul 19 11:41:40 2015 UTC,"Well there was a 6 month time skip between kaneki beating Jason and kaneki first using his half kakuja so I wouldn't really call it spontaneous, at least in universe. Also some people mentioned that there was a rumor that half ghouls were stronger and more resilient, can't remember what chapter that was in though.  Don't forget that cannibalism increases the amount of rc cells in a ghoul/half ghouls body which may result in a stronger kagune which are made completely of rc cells."
manga,3dtonf,lostmyth,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:22:02 2015 UTC,But Kaneki himself was confused what the half-kakuja was and it was probably the first time he used it (as seen here).
manga,3dtonf,BaconMasherz,9,Sun Jul 19 11:29:34 2015 UTC,Just because kaneki didn't know what a kakuja is doesn't mean that he can't be one. It's a biological thing for ghouls so it probably came naturally to him. And like I said earlier there was a 6 month time gap and it seems to take time for a ghoul to develop a kakuja as very few ghouls have one and all known half-ghouls seem to have one so they might be able to get a kakuja faster than normal.
manga,3dtonf,lostmyth,7,Sun Jul 19 11:34:19 2015 UTC,"That wasn't that he didn't know what the kakuja was. He knew full well what he was doing by feeding off of only ghouls but instead that point was of him losing it after hurting Banjou while still not being in control of himself.  Like /u/lostmyth said, that's 6 months of eating just other ghouls to make himself more powerful, nothing super quick."
manga,3dtonf,Methil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:36:03 2015 UTC,He did get peeled by jason for weeks so his body have that power up then he was eating ghouls and fighting so he was always strengthening his body.

manga,3dtonf,Siroha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:00 2015 UTC,"For me, it's because we're now reading from the perspective of the dudes in white, which imo is more boring. I preferred reading about the underdogs or oppressed ghouls more.  Also i feel like the mangaka's gotten worse at panel progression. It's hard to understand when there's a scene transition and the action scenes are harder to understand as well. The art in general just feels much more disoriented.  And i miss the old crew, i literally can't remember the names of more than 5 new characters. They're just soooo... uninteresting, compared to the old characters."

manga,3dtonf,phaggymiscer,-11,Sun Jul 19 10:57:56 2015 UTC,"I also agree. Ishida took away everything that I loved about TG. There's no Kaneki, Anteiku, some of my favourite characters like Touka or Banjo, there's no amazing fights or revelations anymore. Even Aogiri. Re: is a shadow of TG. Sasaki is boring, the CCG is boring, the fights are boring and he's introducing so many characters I can't remember half of them or care about the ones I do remember.   The CCG was interesting on their own but they don't work as the main focus of the story. TG was all about Ghouls and now they're just barely in it. Not to mention the tone change in Re: compared to TG. If Ishida doesn't bring Kaneki back for good (which doesn't look like it's going to happen) I'm just going to drop this manga."

Most of these things happen later in the chapter count that we're current at. Kaneki itself doesn't have a fight up till ayato, the only exception being with Amon in Mado's death.  I mean, okay you have to wait now and stuff and we understand, but seriously, half of those complains just speedread the whole 143 chapters and complain about slow pacing, it's a fucking joke."

Though the Japanese was ahead of us and releases were infrequent. Yes they happen later but they happen and shape TG. TG hits it's stride around then and keeps that form for the remainder of its duration. Re: is nothing like the first half of TG either. Even the first half had interesting fights and featured focus on Anteiku characters and ghouls. I don't see how my points are invalid.   Also if you read my comment again, not once did I complain about slow pacing."

My issue with this manga is that the focus is on 50 brand new characters that I cannot bring myself to give 2 fucks about. There were so many great characters developed over the first season, and now they're all disregarded in the favor of essentially a bunch of brand new faces. What is even going on right now?"

manga,3dtonf,Red-San,4,Sun Jul 19 12:30:29 2015 UTC,I do think Ishida is doing on purpose and I do love that.  Most mangas I read have a hard time to slow the pace and make good world building/character building aside the MC.  He is taking his time and he is exploring some stuff that you can't really say is a straight shounen battle manga but for me is great.

Baam wouldn't have lasted a minute against a ranker on a feat of STRENGHT, but as has been repeatedly shown (Koon against Quant, Wangnan against Mule Love) trickery CAN get you an advantage.  I mean, in a world where even basic math skills are not certain (the puzzle Hwa Ryun solved required basic high school maths at best, yet was taken as an extremely strong lock, one sufficient for a person of Hoaquin's caliber)... This is the only way one could have won.  As Hermione said, even some of the strongest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic."

manga,3dudoh,accountmadeforants,7,Sun Jul 19 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"It'll get a more elaborate explanation later on, but the gist of it is that you have to ""accomplish something great"".

E.g. run a 100KM marathon, get more agility and stamina points - go on a true adventure, get a higher level. Conversely, you don't get points simply for walking, and you don't level up simply by going through the dungeon and killing a few mobs."

manga,3dudoh,accountmadeforants,4,Mon Jul 20 05:12:32 2015 UTC,"A little bit of both. It's important to note that the stuff the gods write on their back isn't just their stats, but also their life's story (starting from when they join the familia), so the event that makes them level up has to make for a good story, in a way.  In that sense, the event being of great importance to the person in question makes sense, but it doesn't necessarily have to be, and probably won't work unless it's something genuinely impressive. (Otherwise, Ais and people just in it for the money would have a much harder time levelling up.)"

manga,3dudoh,LastWalker,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure about that... I think if someone manages to level up with a stat at the lowest possible rank, it will still be weaker than 1SS."
manga,3dudoh,Tumor159,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:58:00 2015 UTC,No. lvl up is a hard reset. Your previous stats don't matter at all.
manga,3dudoh,LastWalker,7,Sun Jul 19 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure their previous stats still matter after leveling up. Leveling up gives them a huge boost, but I don't think that, for example, someone who has never used magic before will be able to use spells as powerful as someone's who mainly used magic before leveling up."
manga,3dudoh,PM_ME_TITS_MLADY,2,Sun Jul 19 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"In that sense yes, someone without magic won't suddenly have magic. Other than that you are wrong, at least it is never mentioned."
manga,3dudoh,LastWalker,3,Mon Jul 20 05:46:12 2015 UTC,"No, leveling up is not a hard reset, it's actually hinted that it's carried over all over the novel.  2D is not stronger than 1S if the aggregate sum of their 2D and 1X isn't higher than 900."
manga,3dudoh,PM_ME_TITS_MLADY,2,Mon Jul 20 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source? Like specific pages where you get that from? I read up to volume 4 and i always understood it as a hard reset. Your normal traits still carry over (bell is fast, others are stronger) but your stats conpletely reset to the lowest."
manga,3dudoh,LastWalker,2,Mon Jul 20 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"I dont know the exact source, but it's stated very clearly in one of the novels that there are hints/rumors among the various familias that stats from previous levels becomes a hidden stat after you level.  Certainly not concrete, but there are zero sources that states what you say about 2D being stronger than 1S, that's your total speculation, whereas the hidden stat thing is at least mentioned in the novel."
manga,3dudoh,PM_ME_TITS_MLADY,2,Mon Jul 20 07:31:40 2015 UTC,"I remember the first part, you are right there. However it is clearly stated multiple times that no lvl 1 can fight a lvl 2. Under no circumstances should that be possible, which is why bell surprised everyone"
manga,3dudoh,LastWalker,2,Mon Jul 20 08:33:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what proves the existence of hidden stats, because he is the exceptional case, he is that special circumstance, because his stats for lv1 is bigger than what other people have for 1+2."
manga,3dudoh,Havoshin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:59:00 2015 UTC,I think we are arguing in different directions. It seems like what you call hidden stats is what I just understand as the level up.   We should stop here since we are moving into spoiler territory with our argument

manga,3dvc79,MagicalQazq,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:48 2015 UTC,In some of that site's earlier chapters they had a page inserted with the rankings.  I can only suggest looking through some of the chapters in the late 20s and 30s.  Correction. It seems they removed those pages from the early chapters.  but Chapter 46 page 23 has it.

manga,3duse8,Heatstrike,7,Sun Jul 19 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"Real Account - ch. 1-21 - Really enjoying this. Very fun to read. The art is great, the dialogue is well written, and it's interesting to read. Yuuma is a good MC.  All You Need Is Kill - finished - Loved this. Should have read this a long time ago. Art is pure quality and the plot had my full attention all the way through. Keiji is an extremely great character. Smart, made decisions very quickly, and the intensity of his resolve made him extremely fun to read. I wish there was more, but it was very satisfying.   Pluto - finished - A very gripping story. The plot was well thought out. Dialogue and characters were high quality. The conclusion lived up to expectations too. Intense and emotional and the ending was satisfying. But I did feel it would have benefited by having 1 or 2 more chapters to show the aftermath, explain a few more things and show what the characters are doing now. Overall, pretty great. I rate this higher than 20CB.  Bonnouji - ch. 1-20 - It's alright. A nice, innocent romance. But not anything exceptionally praiseworthy. Comedy isn't that strong. And the main guy brings it down. The main woman is a good character, but the guy is boring. He's just kind of... there. Mostly says generic ""small talk"" lines. It's decent enough to finish though.  Ubel Blatt - ch. 1-10 - Had potential. The MC is decent and there were some good moments, but it just seemed like a second-rate bootleg Berserk. Tries too hard to be edgy sometimes, and the writing isn't too great. There's too much repetition in the speech and it feels like the characters' personalities aren't being fully taken into account. They say what the plot needs them to say. Most of the villains don't have much depth to their characters either.  Hatarakanai Futari - ch. 1-42 - Concept had potential. But the comedy/jokes fall flat most of the time. The punchlines just aren't strong enough."

manga,3duse8,cowflu,5,Mon Jul 20 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"I read more than I had planned to this week.  I really should study more.   Aho Girl (ch46) - Looks like that's the end of the vacation arc.  Akkun was a real sourpuss this chapter. Daitai Konnande? (ch01-03) - cirno9baka is translating and likes this series so I decided to give it a shot.  As a fan of the genre, I find it rather average.  It's enjoyable, sure, but doesn't really do anything to set itself apart.  The main character looks a lot like Yui from Yuyushiki (which I enjoyed more), so this manga had me constantly thinking about that. Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon (ch09-10) - Excellent as usual. Cloth Eating Girl (oneshot) - The ""zombie"" angle was really weak.  Like, I'm sure there's some sort of textile ghost/spirit in some culture.  There are spirits for everything! Yuusha ga Shinda! (ch04-26) - I'm really enjoying this.  There's more fan-service than I expected, but the characters are good and the plot is entertaining.  spoilers Boku to Kotori-chan (ch1-15) - There are some funny parts, but overall I'd say this series is just average. Dragons Rioting (ch01-22) - While looking at the MU listing for some manga I'm never going to read, I noticed there is a ""All-girls school becomes integrated"" tag.  Heh.  Aside from Seitokai Yakuindomo, I'm uninterested in those series since they are nearly always harems.  But Dragons Rioting has such a cool name!  The synopsis sounded good and it seemed to be a comedy-action series, so I checked it out.  It definitely delivers on those fronts.  There's a lot of over-the-top fight scenes, and the protagonist isn't pervy so his condition is only used for jokes.  Unfortunately, the ecchi is also over the top.  I was expecting high-kick panty shots and standard shenanigans, but the protagonist ended up at Boin High: where the bust sizes are made up and the dress code doesn't matter.  Also, clothes exploding off during fights.  Ugh.  The fanservice is grossly excessive, which is a shame since the rest of the series is pretty good.  The protagonist is likable, his adventures are fun, and the plot moves at a decent pace.  I quite like Rurina too.  I'm hoping she starts getting more screen-time after the current arc.  The author could be setting her up for it, and it'd be cool if Rintaro built up his own faction.  I'm hoping she doesn't end up like Himeji from Yankee-kun to Megane-chan. Tonari no Nanige-chan (ch01-13) - I wasn't expecting much going into this (the premise is fairly standard), but the series ended up being really cute and funny.  The first chapter or two is about what you'd expect, but then the cast and situations become more robust.  The chapters are surprisingly long.  I'd expect a series like this to have 5-9 page chapters, but these are usually 18 pages.  Or maybe there aren't really chapters and Overload is just cutting them like that.  In any case, the chapter count of 13 actually represents two and half volumes. Kumamiko - Girl Meets Bear (ch01-10) - This was okay.  I was expecting to be cuter and/or funnier though. Madoka and Mei's Secret Workshop (ch01-03) - Pretty meh.  It's the kind of story which is labeled as comedy just because it would be suspicious if there weren't any genres.  Pitiable main character, lots of jerks.  Not for me. Saint Young Men (ch34-35, 44-45) - Reading those lackluster series reminded me of this glorious one.  There's a gap in the translations since a new group is partially taking over the project.  I'll probably wait until the gap is filled or the German tank is released to continue the series."
manga,3duse8,KnivesMillions,2,Sun Jul 19 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"I just began Saint Young Men, only in chapter 9 but I gotta say the OVA and Movie are way better, at least for the few chapters they adapted of course, I hope the manga gets better."
manga,3duse8,cowflu,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I can't really compare the Saint Young Men manga and animation since I think both are great.  I'm a big fan of the manga though (it's easily one of my favorites), so I hope you start liking it more.  Is there any aspect you find particularly shortcoming?  I am a little biased since I had finished reading the Bible shortly before I got into the series so I was excited to get the Jesus-references that would have flown over my head a year prior."
manga,3duse8,KnivesMillions,2,Mon Jul 20 07:57:46 2015 UTC,"The art for the first few chapters was pretty bad, and might still be (can't remember), its not just the characters but the lack of environments made it somewhat confusing and weird, which doesn't happen in the movie. Again, this is just from the chapters I've read but seemed like just a bunch of the jokes the author came out with slapped together to makes some chapters, without much connections between them."
manga,3duse8,cowflu,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Thanks to the kinds of stuff I usually read, I'm not particularly attuned to art and environments.  I'm just concerned with the quality of jokes, and I find them pleasing here.  The series is quite episodic though.  I just attributed it to them being on vacation."
manga,3duse8,shwag945,6,Mon Jul 20 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"Got stuck in EU4 again for most of the week. Got to read a good amount of my print manga.  Completed  The Angel of Elhamburg (Elhanburg no Tenshi) - A Josei manga by Aki that i purchased. I am gonna need to reread this short series that was actually supposed to be just a oneshot. Somewhat confusing because of constant time jumps. In terms of what the angel means Some intense emotions involved in the series and i could not put it down (partly because i would be lost if i did). The art was quite nice with the exception of one thing. The mangaka has serious issues with hands. Most of the time hands are out of the frame but when they are they look horrible most of the time. It is sorta funny. The art is not to josei. I would recommend people read it even if my score is low. Overall on a first read i give it 6.5/10. I expect the score to rise on a reread.  Reading/Ongoing  Thermae Romae - Oh man I have been waiting to read this series for so long. I have had all three omnibuses on my shelf for a while just waiting for the right time to read. (got a good discount like $20-$25 per omnibus compared to the retail of $30-$35). This series has three major things I love put together in a manga: Ancient Rome, Modern Japan, and bathroom humor. The reaction faces are some next level stuff (really postures tho). The jokes are really hilarious. The story also seems somewhat believable if you think about how a very rational architect from ancient Rome would act if he suddenly time travel to modern Japanese bathrooms/onsens and wanted to adapted the Japanese way into Romen architecture. The art is fan-fucking-tastic. The mangaka trained at an art school in Italy and the art resembles a mix of Japanese manga art and also European looking art. The MC looks like an ancient roman statue. In addition the mangaka has down a two page spread of historical information about various Roman and Japanese bathing rituals/related stuff along with her own life story between each chapter. Really interesting stuff.  I have only read the first half of the first omnibus plus one chapter. So the first volume and starting the second. If you like Ancient Roman History and Bath houses you will love this series.  Fujimura-kun Mates - Read volume 4. The harem continues. dat kiss at the end of v.04 doh lmfao. Also Eri is still the best but Claudia is second because she is hilariously stupid.   Also I read the chapters of Girls of the Wild's, One Punch-Man, Tokyo Ghoul:re, and Minamoto-kun Monogatari that came out this week."
manga,3duse8,blablabla9876,6,Sun Jul 19 19:30:06 2015 UTC,"Reread:  Onani Master Kurosawa (1-31, i.e. beginning to end) Reacted pretty similarly to when I first read it several years ago -- the reveal was still heartrending (even if it was 100% the best for all parties involved) and the confession made me stop and collect myself before continuing.  Rurouni Kenshin (1-255, i.e. beginning to end) This is such a great manga, there's really nothing more to be said, honestly -- wait -- Oro?  Read/Currently Reading:  Shamo (165-58+) Dropped this a while back when the China arc ended. I noticed it being represented in the banner and when I looked it up, I found out it had ended. Decided to see how it went... so far I've regretted my decision to pick it back up.  It started off so well, but I just can't stand this shit. Like, let's say at the beginning of the manga on a scale of 0-100, he has no training or strength, etc. and is a 0. At the end of an arc he's a 60. Next arc starts, he's a 10; end - 70; beginning - 10; end  - 80. Everything he learns and does during the previous arc just disappears. He learned Chi manipulation -- where the fuck did that go?! Who was that old lady? Why is MC talked up like such a beast, but at the same time such a jobber?! Worst part is, I'm going to end up finishing this today, getting more and more upset."

Urgh, I'll never understand authors who do that, once is already infuriating enough (those who have read the Breaker and its seqquel New Waves know what I mean) but to use it at every arc is such a cheap way to make the story longer.  I get it, training is necessary, new challenges arise, more powerful foes, you need to acquire new techniques or improve the ones you got, maybe switch things up a little and mix a bit of another martial arts into yours because the techniques you got are flawed against that new opponent ... but don't let your character grow weaker overtim, it's just not fun."

Tonari no Robot (Ch 2-4) Nishi Uko always writes a beautiful story. The emotions that this series shares are something indescribable and I can't wait to experience the rest of it. Disc  Murcielago (21-27) A big thanks to CXC-scans for yet again providing a huge update on this series (and for Tonari no Robot). Murcielago proves that even the craziest and most depraved stories can be strangely warm and funny amid the bloodshed. Disc  Eventually I Will Become Yours (Ch 2) This series keeps pulling me in with an intriguing story and writing that is so completely satisfying. Disc  Sakura Trick (Ch 34) The perfect mix of happiness and kissing. Disc  Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon (Ch 10-11) More Tooru was just one of many reasons these new chapters were such a welcome sight. This series is extremely well paced, all the things I love about it keep getting better and better even as the characters and their interactions slowly begin to change.  Stretch (Ch 40) Another chapter released, another long wait begins for the next one. Disc  After Hours (Ch 2) Another incredible series that doesn't let up in its second chapter. I can't wait to see it continue with this unique mix of story and art. Disc  Haiko Dolls (Ch 1) A new 4-koma series about a strange girl who turns someone into a doll. I need to see more to get a better idea of what kind of story and comedy this will involve, but so far I like it enough to keep reading.  Fuwa Fuwa no Kimochi What I thought would be just a simple relaxing story proved to be surprisingly funny. Disc  Age 15 (Ch 2) The NSFW story for the ages continues to be very NSFW. The story is surely going to heat up in other ways, but for now it has gotten off to a great start.Disc"

manga,3duse8,MelonMelon28,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"This week, I was in the mood for some light-hearted mangas, some sweet slice of life stories, no violence, definitely no gore, apparently a lot of shoujo ai.   Temen de Gushi - A great slice of life story on its own with an interesting MC, the shoujoi ai is just some cherry on top as she meets and falls in love with a girl from another school while she commutes to school; Exciting / Fluttering Feelings too, which is another shoujo ai story but set in college this time around, art is slightly worse than TdG but it's a promising story. Ano Musume ni Kiss to Shirayuri o - yet another shoujo ai story, the author seems to have a strange idea of what an all-girls high school would be, pretty much everything leads to a love story, coach-player relations, top student rivalries, senpai-kouhai relations, etc .. ah well, filled my quota of sweetness for the week. Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko! , Tomo-Chan is a girl but as she was always a tomboy raised by some dumbass Karate dojo master, she's always treated by her best friend like some bro, which leads to some really hilarious situation ... seems like their relationship is starting to evolve but I'm sure it'll lead to a lot more misunderstandings along the way, definitely recommend. Ame Nochi Hare - pretty much one of the only ""big"" gender bender mangas I haven't read (well, the genre has so few interesting stories, I'd classify anything with correct drawing and an interesting story lasting more than a few chapters as ""big""), the other being the AKB49 one ... main characters switch gender when the rain falls which leads to some interesting situations, it actually got me thinking about how interesting it would be to live a life where you'd experience living as both genders, it would probably be as awkward as interesting."
manga,3duse8,cowflu,2,Sun Jul 19 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"Oho, if you're interested in filling your quota of sweetness with some light-hearted shoujo ai, I recommend everything by Itou Hachi, particularly Snow of Spring (not shoujo ai) and Spring, a Minuet (completely unrelated to Snow of Spring).

I used to read a lot more genres when I was younger, but now I know what I like and tend to stick to that.  I may try out alternate stuff at some time, but that's a task for when my backlog doesn't have 300+ entries.  I mostly read light-hearted fare, so here are some things I can recommend off the top of my head:   Flying Witch - A relaxing manga about a witch-in-training.  The premise may make you think there's room for conflict, but all the characters are easy-going so they're just like ""Oh, you're a witch?  Cool."" Joshi Kausei - A dialogue-less ""cute girls doing cute things"" manga.  It may sound gimicky, but the author pulls it off really well.  Majo to Houki to Kurobuchi Megane - A cute, silly, funny 4koma about a high-school girl and her really-bad-at-magic witch neighbor.  This series has been fully translated. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon - The everyday life of an office worker and her dragon maid.  The author's drawing is a bit wonky at times, but the series is very enjoyable. Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu - A very shy girl wants to befriend everyone in her class.  The main character is super adorable.

manga,3duse8,acksed,2,Mon Jul 20 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"Not much, as it's been busy and I kinda forgot which manga I was following, but I'm mostly caught up:  Nana to Kaoru 135: I have been waiting for this for a very long time. Nana finally realises it's love, courtesy of Tachi outright telling her. It's hard to read the preceding pages of Nana's misery, though. ;_;  Teppuu 30: It's a warmup chapter for the final fight, but it's very effective at ratcheting up the tension. Natsuo's going full Alucard, Yuzuko's looking forward to a big heaping bowl of spiders... They're going to absolutely slaughter each other. The brother finally makes his appearance, too.

For the sake of your enjoyment I will not say anything about the plot, but urge you to at least read the first 3 chapters. They should give you a clear idea about what this manga is about  Mahou Tsukai no Yome I like the ""Magical British"" feel of this manga. The story is good but the art is quite lackluster. They are not bad but I wouldn't consider it to be anything more than standard fare  Me and the Devil Blues Probably the most american thing ever written by a Japanese author. So raw, so vigorous, so well-written, so good. Hiramoto Akira once agains proves to me how much of a genius he is with his acute sense of directing and art quality of the highest caliber. Being one of Hiramoto's first works, it's so radically different from Prison School but also similar in many ways, like his trademark dramatic facial expressions, for example. It got cancelled at volume 5, unfortunately."

It is a shame a lot of the earlier scans are the same quality as an overused .jpg meme but it was readable (just).

The sequel is quite short(around 9000 words, the translator did a really good job) and is highly recommended since it gives the manga an even more satisfying ending."

manga,3duse8,Aruseus493,3,Tue Jul 21 06:12:57 2015 UTC,"Forgot to post this last week.   Sword Art Online - Progressive (Asuna Manga) - Re-read - Was chatting about this series with some friends and ended up re-reading this silly adaption of the LN. Despite the non-canon part of it, it's a lot of fun to see Asuna as the main character.  Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou - Caught Up - Started and caught up on this series this week. In the end, seems just like another To Love-Ru to me. MC is a little more composed than Rito and is more of a man I guess. In the end, it's pretty much just a slice of life harem. I'll keep reading in the future.  Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut - Caught Up - Started and caught up on this manga adaption this week. If I had to describe this series based off the first 4 chapters, it's literally Infinite Stratos for a Fantasy World. Overall, it's just a cliched series through and through. Wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for something well written.   Stuff from this week.   Daitai Konna n de? - Start and read the two chapters for this series. Seems interesting. Although still not at the point of the club yet. >_> Mei☆Com - Caught Up - Started and caught up on this spin-off of Gate. It's essentially a series within a series kind of thing. This is apparently one of Itami's favorite series and I can see why. It's pretty enjoyable and has a slight deconstruction aspect in regards to Magical Girls. Nothing like Madoka but more related to traditional Magical Girls. Would definitely recommend this enjoyable comedy. Gate - Teikoku no Bara Kishidan - Pinya Co Lada 14-sai - Re-read - I re-read the only two currently scanlated chapters for this spinoff of Gate. I'm still looking forward to more of this series since it's pretty funny to see Pina at a younger age. Hshs Sasero!! - Started - Chapter 1 - Despite the English title, this series is actually pretty funny for the first chapter so far. Looking forward to more in the future. Kuzu no Honkai - Started - Started and then immediately caught up as usual. It was picked up by CR under the English title, Scum's Wish. It's a pretty entertaining messed up romance series. There's pretty much pity all around as the web of love is warped with plenty of non-returnable love. Overall, it's a pretty interesting series so I'd definitely recommend it for someone looking for a different kind of romance story."
manga,3duse8,Alfndrate,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Berserk Volumes 1 - 10 - I saw the anime about a year ago, and never bothered to pick up the series because I had heard that it's slow, and the author has been known to disappear every time a new Idolmaster game is released. But after much poking and prodding by my friend who introduced me to the series I started to tear through the volumes. I'm reading these volumes as quickly as I can because of everything that's covered in the anime, and I'd like to get to stuff I haven't seen yet. I'm really enjoying the series, and didn't think I'd not like it, but I was kind of daunted by the number of volumes I'd have to collect.   Tokyo Ghoul Volume 1 - I've seen both seasons of the anime, and last weekend when I was at Barnes and Noble buying a late birthday gift for a friend, I saw this and snagged it up. Much like Berserk above, I've seen these scenes before and so I tore through it, but it was cool to see Kaneki's origins again.   Food Wars Volume 6 - If it wasn't for some self control I would be caught up on this series and have massive spoilers for the anime, but I'm really excited about the anime, so I don't want to spoil more than an episode or two. Though all bets are off when the anime finishes it's first season and I'm left with nothing but the manga until the second season :P.   Bokura no Hentai Volumes 1 - 7 - This was mostly two weeks ago, but I didn't participate in last week's thread. So this and the next manga were suggested to me because Crunchyroll suggested that I check out ""Scum's Wish"". So I checked it out and was going to read it until I discovered what the big secret was. The secret fell flat on its face imo so Bokura no Hentai was suggested by one of my friends because he was trying to guess the big secret and suggested that it was a pair of Traps, but I said that would have been a better twist. I am enjoying the story, and I find it very well written simply because I've gone through the cycle of wanting pummel the main characters throughout the story. Like Character A does something dumb, I get upset at their stupidity and then later go ""no it's okay, don't worry life doesn't always suck this much.""   Yubisaki Milk Tea Chapters 1 - 34 - Same as Bokura above, this was another series suggested by my friend after discussing the big secret in Scum's Wish. Unlike Bokura I'm enjoying the series, but it's certainly taken a back seat to other series I'm reading because I just don't like how wishy-washy the main character is.   In addition, I've been keeping up on Fuuka and Seven Deadly Sins, along with a few others that haven't updated in the past week but haven't caught up on."

'Inside Mari' starts off with spectating the pathetic life of Isai Komori, a hikkokomori who's dropped out of college, hasn't told his parents, lives off of their money, and spends the majority of his time sleeping, playing video games, and masterbating.   However he has ritual that he follows, everyday without fail he goes to nearby convenience store and stalks a girl home who comes there everyday as well.  One evening while he is doing this she happens turn around and the next thing Konori knows is waking up as this girl, Mari.  The story so far faces his struggles at trying not to destroy Mari's life as well as dealing with the female body and all of it's nuances, while trying to get back to his own body.  So far the series is at 54 chapters and we get an approximate half chapter every Monday.  It's actually an amazing series so far as i've never seen a series that tackles this series so well and the writing is brilliant.  Be prepared however this series is very much NSFW as it has plenty of nudity and obscene... scenes. But if you're in for somthing diffrent then I emplore you to give it a try."

Supporting your favorite authors, telling your friends, and enjoying new chapters is what it's all about. I just wanted to stop by and explain why it's less than FwPA's normal quality.  When I first started out I was QC, but I wasn't very good, so we supplemented it by posting the beta of the chapter to 4chan. Since people enjoyed the new chapter threads so much, I kept the tradition going. Usually by the time it gets to 4chan it's mostly complete, but every so often I forget something or someone points out something to me. It's sort of a last change public QC before the actual chapter gets released.  And it is possible you spoke with me. I was at Anime Expo along with a few other FwPA staff. Either way, I'm glad you all enjoyed the chapter. It doesn't get any less wacky from here."
manga,3dt6jh,thejellydude,2,Sun Jul 19 08:06:28 2015 UTC,"I hate to be off subject, but I've been curious. I heard that the manga is significantly ahead of what is currently translated. Is there a reason for this? Do you guys need help, or donations? Or is it a conscious choice by you guys?"
manga,3dt6jh,Tarage,6,Sun Jul 19 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"Not off topic at all. I'm here to answer any question you guys have.  There are multiple reasons for staying behind the most recent chapter, and the biggest one is this: http://raw.senmanga.com/Jitsu_wa_Watashi_wa/85/20/  We scanlate using Takabon raws, meaning raws scanned from the books the author puts out when enough chapters have been drawn to make a sort of anthology. They are usually much higher quality and a lot easier to work with. Magazine raws, on the other hand, often suffer in quality. If we ever go fast enough that we run out of Takabon raws, we would be forced to use these inferior scans, and thus the job of cleaning and redrawing becomes exponentially harder.  This ties into another reason why we are purposefully staying behind: Jitsu Wa is a weekly manga. FwPA prides itself on quality scanlation releases, and while manga like MM are caught up with the raws, it's because it's a monthly manga, so we have time to properly do the cleanup. In order to catch up with the raws, we would have to release more than a chapter a week. That would burn up our staff quite quickly. Remember, scanlation is a hobby, not a job, and our members do it in their free time. Anything more than a chapter a week would just be asking too much.

manga,3dt6jh,landsoul,35,Sun Jul 19 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"For all of you complaining that it took 86 chapters to get this glorious progression: Seriously. This manga is basically equal parts romance, as well as comedy. A lot of chapters focus on making you laugh, and the more serious ones try to address Nagisa, Mikan and Youko's feelings. So, technically it only took 42 chapters (mikan's confession) for significant progression. It also went through nagisa's realization and confession, as well as Youko's realization of her feelings, getting over the guilt of ruining the group, and her confession. That's 6 major plot progression points.   Compared to nisekoi, which has 178 chapters and 2 points of progression, This is like a rocket-propelled bunny rabbit versus a superglue turtle.  Tl;Dr: It didn't take THAT long guys, come on."
manga,3dt6jh,qwerto14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:53:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's far less impressive because it's primarily comedy. This has a greater overarching story than the romance, so it can afford to close that subplot this early. When the romance in Nisekoi is over there's a very good chance the series will end, so he really has to delay it if he wants the series to continue."

manga,3dtza2,xMongolian,2,Mon Jul 20 11:57:13 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is an examination of the impact upon the family when their kid has a debilitating condition like that.  It's a less cutesy version of watamote because the girl in this one is dragging her family down into her misery.  She also seems to present symptoms of aspergers as well, which produces obsessive interests to exclusion of all else and difficulty engaging socially.  I would recommend therapy, social skills workshops and anti-anxiety medication.  Unfortunately the culture in Japan doesn't readily recognize the usefulness of mental health treatment, instead treating it as some sort of stigma, which results in many families trying to treat the mental illness on their own or live in denial of it altogether which can end up with a critical case of ""hikikomori""."

If online prices then i got series to buy. If store prices then oh well.   update: it looks like they are are keeping the online prices!!!  proof. They only increase the price of the item they are going to take off so don't worry. Also they choose the cheapest item to remove. The price was exactly what i predicted.    Also withh my membership discount at right stuf the price would have been $64.77 as compared to $56.58 with this sale. :)

manga,3drfy9,Radicool21,8,Sat Jul 18 21:32:27 2015 UTC,I can only see the comedy tag and not a tragedy tag. This this probaly won't have the same ending as the original play. Unless the mangaka has some really dark and sadistic humor.  My worst fear is the shounen tag. I hope that this manga will go further than a loosy ending where nothing is resolved. I hope to see their marriage at least or their kids. And maybe 4 eyes with the sidepony girl.

manga,3dt4ax,shwag945,10,Sun Jul 19 04:59:12 2015 UTC,:/  I wonder if they are going to remove all the manga data about series that are not licensed because they know that people are reading scans and don't want to promote scanlation.   hopefully not RIP in peace MAL.
manga,3dt4ax,c00kinfire,5,Sun Jul 19 05:01:31 2015 UTC,Doubt it. MAL is a database. Why remove content they need to fill? The only things they've done right now are removing/hiding fansub groups from unregistered users.
manga,3dt4ax,Aiorax,5,Sun Jul 19 07:31:53 2015 UTC,They could end up making it a licensed only database now that it is owned by a Japanese company. Possible due to lawsuits direct at them by Japanese publishers. Also out of their own business interest since they are themselves digital manga publishers. Stamping out scanlation (possibly even in this meta way) is still a goal of the publishers.   Another issue coming up is the TPP. No one knows what exactly is in the TPP but a major known goal is copyright protections to all parties. This might mean that we see publishers going after scanlators and readers alike in the US.   I know this is tinfoily but this kind of stuff has happened on the internet before.

Now in their 2nd year of middle school, Mayama has become an ero-freak who specializes in harassing Himemiya.  Determined to unravel the greatest secret of girls, what happens on ""that day"", Mayama follows Himemiya and uncovers...!  --  A manga that takes a period that can be rather awkward for girls, and ramps it up to 11. I quite enjoyed reading this manga as it takes a subject that should be one of the most natural things in the world and gives it a rather unexpected twist.  The characters are pretty fun (Nonoa's hilarious <3), and while the MC starts off as an annoying little shithead, he later on manages to redeem himself and even becomes a bit likeable.   Definitely a manga I would recommend everyone to read. :)"

The art is as beautiful as most, but the style of the dust jackets are much better than most.  There are intricate celtic symbols and  the title backgrounds are detailed instead of being a plain matte.  There are also some house and room layout drawings on the back covers and some cute 4-koma on the front. We all know how nice the story is and the covers are well done to suit the classic nature of the story.  I did a little bit more than just stitching them together this time, I tried to level them so they looked pretty close to the covers as I compared them to my screen.  I know I should have a calibrated screen if I want to do something like that but that's not something I am interested in shelling out money for so I hope my Mk I eyeball was close enough.

The amount of energy that he can use in his ""level 3"" is actually equal to the energy that is typically about level 14 of the spirit forming stage (or w/e it's called). Why is this? Honestly, it isn't explained well (or maybe I forgot, so if anyone wants to jump in here and correct me, feel free) but it has to do with the bead as well as with his inability to give up his earthly attachments."

manga,3dt0tv,petrichorE6,7,Sun Jul 19 04:45:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't recommend bleach to anyone. I loved the series until the fulllbring arc and beyond that the series has been going downhill. The past 100 or so chapters weren't totally crap, but it's not good either. There's a saying that in bleach, the art gets better but the story gets worse; and as an ex-diehard-fan, I have to agree. The only reason why I'm reading it, and there are many who agree, is cause I just want to know how it ends, I don't really care at all for the characters and certainly not the story right now. But people have their own preferences, I for one wouldn't want anyone to start it after reading the current arc, and it says a lot about a series when half the fanbase just wants to see it end.  One Piece however, ages brilliantly. It's been consistent with the story and the character's developments, not many bad things you can say about one piece to be honest and the thing is, the story is just revving up its engines too. There's a ton of chapters but it's worth the investment in every single one of them!  I remember Yuyu Hakusho as one of the first series I've ever watched ever as a kid and I think it still holds its own. I've only seen the anime for it and not the manga but since it's by togashi who made HxH, I'm guessing the art isn't that great and it might be a put off for some people. But don't stop cause the art is bad,art style is just a compliment to a good story.  not like bleach  Which reminds me of your question.. a manga that fits the description(and I can't believe no one has said this yet) would be One Punch Man since the premise is very very similar with the whole super hero business and stuff. It's very similar, and the MC of the series, Saitama, is basically like All Might at 100% at all times. Haha you will have a lot of fun reading this, very funny and there's not many chapters for Murata's manga adaptation just yet. (OPM manga is an adaptation by Murata from the original webcomic version by ONE, their both on going and very good)  I also recommend  Tokyo Ghoul and its sequel TG:re but I guess you have quite a list already so yeah, that's just my 2 cents."
manga,3dt0tv,lostmyth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:51:19 2015 UTC,Bleach is recommendable up till the end of saving Rukia arc. A great case could be made that it's the GOAT shounen arc.
manga,3dt0tv,lostmyth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:02:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I thought it was the perfect shounen manga/anime when they were saving rukia but after that, characters like chad and orihime just became redundant except for a few scenes, like they were introduced as main characters and where are they now? Their forgotten characters, Orihime's hairpin had like specific powers and personalities to them but now all she does is heal, cry and paper shield. They barely held their own against like some weak retired espadas and didn't stand a chance against the actual ones back then so I don't expect them to do much in the current arc which I think is a shame and bad writing on Kubo's part. Also, how BS do you think it will be when all of the sudden chad is able to hold off one of Ywach's like guards?"

manga,3dt8j1,Aruseus493,2,Sun Jul 19 06:08:29 2015 UTC,It's mostly all intertwining stuff that takes place in-between episodes.
manga,3dt8j1,XKriegor,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:01 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be to watch all of the anime(incuding OVA and specials) first before reading the manga.  After that you can read GuP Manga for the same story but from a different perspective(manga uses Yukari's perspective). After that read Little Army so you get to see why Maho is how she is in the anime.  There is also a LN series showing the same events of the anime and manga but from Saori's perspective. Sadly I think this is untranslated.  Next you can go for Gekitou! Maginot-sen desu to see an event not shown in the anime.  Ribbon Warrior tells the story of a different character from the anime from a different school while Motto Love Love Sakusen desu is a silly spinoff that focuses more on the Slice of Life and comedy aspect of GuP.

manga,3dqj1b,BlackB345T,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:16 2015 UTC,Agreed the black hoodie gives her a Spider-Gwen vibe. Would be nice if we got some progression on Jaegu and he finally picks someone (or tells them all flat out no).

Queen with the hoodie outfit though, she rocked that pretty hard, and Daldal is cute as a button but I don't like how the artist is forcing it so hard for her to look like she needs to hide the fact that she met and is on friendly terms with another guy & his little brother.  All of these chapter episodes recently has been lacking the best girl Goseul Lee, she was the first one who helped Jaegu, why isn't her part in the story bigger than this? It really seems like the artist just intended for her to be a supporting character, but we want her to be a main character (or at least I do). It's like Levy McGarden from Fairy Tail, Levy was meant to just be a background character but fans really liked her so she became more of a main supporting character in the series. I guess that's the only difference between this and that..."

manga,3ds0l3,kaidynamite,6,Sun Jul 19 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Since akatsuki no yona was also recommended to you:  Mahou tsukai no yome is the most fantastical/magical of the three.   Akagami no Shirayukihime has the most focus on romance out of the three. its very fairy tale-ish. almost like something from disney  Akatsuki no yona is the most action/adventure oriented of the three.   I love all three and highly recommend you read them all
manga,3ds0l3,kaidynamite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:04:06 2015 UTC,Pretty much what i thought. I already read the first 5 chapters or so of Mahou and about 15 of Akagami so i have an idea what they are about and what the tone is like. Akatsuki i saw a single PV but it had quite a bit of fighting in it.  Either way thanks for all the info. Will probably end up going for all three then. Any recommended order?
manga,3ds0l3,Vhrix,2,Sat Jul 18 23:17:00 2015 UTC,mahou tsukai no yome is at only 20 or so chapters so youll catch up to it quick. Akagami is on 67~ and akatsuki is on like 95~ so just go in that order i'd say.   akagami's anime is airing right now and its top notch so you can try that if you want as well.

Much like her loss to Soma during the Autumn Election, Alice has completely forgot about what the customers of the main street would want; something cheap, delicious, and basically people food.  This chapter shows she is willing to go beyond the boundaries of expensive molecular cooking. I wonder how she will be able to balance Hayama, Ryou, and her style of cooking. I'm sure it'll turn out great."

I didn't mean to say that her 'white' form is the reason I like her, but rather the contrast between her default and pure forms - that is gap moe. The power of a single person to encompass the two complete opposite sides of HNNNG, that's why I respect her.   Where most characters are limited to one aspect of adorable, she can channel both and accentuate them through that contrast, keeping all dimensions of her personality fresh and amusing while staying consistent and true to her character.

manga,3dpt08,linkboy83,2,Sat Jul 18 07:19:38 2015 UTC,3 with girls. they are short lived but reflected on and the girls come back often. Aunt and step mom are glanced at so its possible. NTR is something to watch out for though.
manga,3dpt08,hydrosphere13,2,Sat Jul 18 07:19:29 2015 UTC,wait what was the ntr again?
manga,3dpt08,shwag945,3,Sat Jul 18 07:59:54 2015 UTC,There hasn't been any actually NTR yet. It just is NTRish and the incoming Yuu-san break up has a ton of NTR flags.
manga,3dpt08,hydrosphere13,2,Sat Jul 18 08:06:16 2015 UTC,does seem that way. Hope it doesn't though but we're only half way through the 14 so something will have to break terumi and yuu up.
manga,3dpt08,shwag945,3,Sat Jul 18 08:23:38 2015 UTC,It is rare really to see most of the readership agreeing on one ship (not including Kaoruko). It is quite interesting. I am going to miss yuu-san so much :(
manga,3dpt08,linkboy83,-1,Sat Jul 18 08:26:29 2015 UTC,"Ntr happens subtly in this book. MAINLY the douchy friend as he tries to fuck the aunt. Now this teacher dude. I guess AOI got NTRED from her dad and her obsession, she was first fuck. Glasses girl could be classed under it. The stepmom will have it for sure. YUU i dont think so, yuu will just get screwed over or exstremely jealous havent figured out yet."
manga,3dpt08,shwag945,7,Sat Jul 18 08:54:07 2015 UTC,Stepmom? Also none of those are NTR. NTR is partner poaching in its most basic meaning. NTR in the the pure manga form is when a character catches their SO getting fucked by another person right in front of them. In the most extreme versions they are forced to watch (including sometimes rape). The extremely light version is when a BF or GF is caught kissing someone. Anyone hitting on or manipulating the aunt is not NTR because she is not in a relationship with anyone.   Also in terms of Minamoto's relationship with Kaoruko if they were caught in the act it would be considered NTR but the moments that Kaoruko is with Minamoto alone they are actually outside of the story narrating. Also usually that stuff happens between conquests.   IIRC the Glasses girl did not tell Minamoto she was still with that guy also they did not get caught cheating. In addition since they were not the couple with infidelity problems (not even a couple) they were not the subject of the possible NTR.
manga,3dpt08,linkboy83,0,Sat Jul 18 09:08:52 2015 UTC,Due tell NTR is cuckolding by base meaning. Did glasses girl willing cheat if yes then Ntr or else no. She did. ( getting caught doesnt matter)  Did AOI mind fuck herself and cheat on her daddy cause shes got daddy issues.yes  dude bro couldnt get any futher with the aunt due to credits for her class so theres nothing subjective to hold a conversation with her. Hes in her class now though with the magic of story pacing. That teacher is sketchy and fits how your thinking of NTR.  Are you reading the tale of genji cause  genji fucks his stepmom and knocks her up meaning unless she changes it minamoto will have a similar  affair with his. This is subjective to what role the aunt sees herself as but the stepmom will be  a girl.
manga,3dpt08,kaidynamite,4,Sat Jul 18 11:22:37 2015 UTC,cheating != ntr
manga,3dpt08,Hulliganner,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's this.  Basically, the girl is in a relationship, cheats on him and ends with the other guy for a reason or the other. Depression/rage inducing, yes.  Nowdays, NTR as a term is wrongly used more often than not for situations where a rival appears between the main couple, even if they are not in a relationship."
manga,3dpt08,MajorLeeScrewed,3,Sat Jul 18 08:21:12 2015 UTC,"He knows what NTR is, he's asking where it appears in the manga."

manga,3dpt08,linkboy83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:45:42 2015 UTC,Actually you need this cause NTR is a broad term for adultry. People miss little things cause they are looking for that base element of someone stealing the aunt away which is one part of what NTR means.

manga,3dqyw1,Strong_Right,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:22 2015 UTC,Seems a lot of people have not bought any digital copies. Interesting.
manga,3dqyw1,Random-Webtoon-Fan,5,Sat Jul 18 17:44:07 2015 UTC,I'm actually amazed the answer for digital copies is not zero.
manga,3dqyw1,drapollo,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"I bet there's quite a correlation between people who answered ""yes"" to digital and ""Japanese"" to language. Amazon.co.jp has an astounding selection of digital manga in Japanese, for less than the cost of a physical copy and obviously no shipping costs, but almost none of it is available (legally) in English digitally."
manga,3dqyw1,weeaboo_throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:38:20 2015 UTC,"That explains a lot. It also supports the sales of a series domestically in Japan, and that really matters for new series.  Can you buy digital copies on amazon.co.jp with a western credit card and no Japanse address?"
manga,3dqyw1,drapollo,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:47 2015 UTC,"I made an amazon.co.jp account with a fake address, but then once I put in my credit card it removed all the ""buy now"" links on digital items, because apparently they don't want people outsite Japan buying downloadable things, possibly at the publishers' requests or possibly for some legal reason, who knows. So, I made a new account, this time only putting in an address but leaving out the credit card. I then bought a gift card in Yen on the first account, paid for it in USD, had it send to my new account's email, redeemed it in the new account, and it added the balance fine. You need to give them a (fake) phone number the first time you buy something, but you should be fine after that.  I've done this like 6 times now and I'm wondering if they'll try to stop me before I go broke.  Keep in mind that while the quality is generally pretty good, Amazon seems to have no real quality control on the files provided by publishers, and out of the ~30 volumes I have bought so far, one of them has some pretty horrific JPEG artifacts on the cover and color pages (though the grey pages were all mostly fine)."
manga,3dqyw1,weeaboo_throwaway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:53:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, I'm mostly interested in buying very new stuff, were your quality issues mostly from older volumes? I'm also thinking of mostly Weekly Shonen Jump series, so I feel like their quality should be consistent, since they also release issues digitally.  Anyway, thanks a lot for your description, I'll look into it. By the way, why the throwaway? Don't want people to know you're a weeaboo?"
manga,3dqyw1,drapollo,2,Mon Jul 20 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"The low quality volume is the first in its series, but it's newer than other, older series' with no quality issues from the same publisher.  When I post, I generally make a new account for every post, because last time someone found out about my ""real"" account it was devistating. However, I made this account for a post on /r/manga the other day, then instead of making a new account for these posts today, I just logged into this one for no apparent reason. So ironically, this account with ""throwaway"" in the name is currently the closest thing I have to a ""real"" account."

manga,3dqyw1,drapollo,2,Mon Jul 20 08:41:12 2015 UTC,"The series was Himegoto. Don't judge me ;)  The books are sold as AZW3, which can only officially be read on a Kindle or the Kindle desktop app for Windows or Mac OS X. However, you can install Calibre, a free and open source ebook manager, and then install a plugin which can break the AZW3 DRM and import the books. You can then export them as a ZIP which contains, in addition to some other garbage, a folder with JPEGs in it. It's a little more work than I would like, but it's certainly worth it.  If you're fine with the Kindle reader, and not too paranoid that Amazon will erase the books after you've bought them, you could just use the official reader, but it's very obnoxious."

manga,3dpa57,Bzorkyarm,3,Sun Jul 19 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"So how much more could the odds be stacked against FT? Zeref as Emperor, the Spriggan 12 each being more powerful by and large than ANYONE in Ishgar, AND Acnologia? Part of me is really banking on the bit about ""The 12 not being easy to keep still"", maybe a few of them will betray the Empire? Hell, maybe Serena is just a double agent for Ishgar. Either way, even with nakama powerups or training, I find it difficult for FT or even Fiore to win this conflict. Maybe we'll get to meet more Wizards from other countries on Ishgar and they'll be the reinforcements FT needs to tip the scales."

manga,3dpa57,FailerQt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:20:00 2015 UTC,Indeed him setting himself and Acnologia apart really seems to me it will be everyone including Fairy Tail the Spriggan 12 etc vs Zeref vs Acnologia. No matter how strong the Spriggan 12 are they will be no match vs Zeref
manga,3dpa57,guppywastaken,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:19:30 2015 UTC,Tip the scales    You mean Nakama plot magic isn't good enough?

He couldn't take on Acnologia and the humans on his own, so he created an empire to compete with them both. Impressive.

manga,3dqu0h,Strong_Right,8,Sat Jul 18 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"This is interesting, but I think you'll get better results if you gave options for specific numbers, like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc.  Many people bought a volume just once or twice, or just bought the volumes for one series out of everything they read.  I think that for the vast majority of this subreddit, if you had to compare ""manga read"" with ""manga bought"", it would be something like a 50:1 ratio.  Seriously.  (but for this poll, you will probably come up with almost everyone having bought at least one volume in their lifetime.)"

Top 2 in this list are Kingdom and Akame ga Kill in terms of action all other manga's also really focus on story but Kingdom and AgK really focus hard on the action."

manga,3dqw7p,Vhrix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"Might check out Matsumoto, but actually despite him having a unique style I'm not really a fan of it from what I've seen in Tekkon Kinkreet (tho i liked the backgrounds) and Ping Pong. Anyways, what besides those two would you recommend the most.  I see all the seasons of JoJo and I'll probably be checking out the other parts in manga too. I usually dislike battle shounen, but I like the over-the-topness and overall silliness quite a bit, plus it helps that each story eventually ends and doesn't go on forever like all the dragonballs, narutos etc."
manga,3dqw7p,undefinedobfuscator,2,Sat Jul 18 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"If you didn't like Tekkon Kinkreet and Ping Pong, I guess there's no point of reading Matsumoto, it's probably not your type of thing. The image I linked is from Takemitsu Zamurai, so if you liked that style, you can try that.  If you're looking for beautiful art in general and not just ""surreal artsy"" stuff, I also recommend stuff by Daisuke Igarashi, like Children of the Sea. (edit: I just saw someone else recommended him in this thread, so nevermind. But you should definitely check him out.)  Uhh, other than that, I'm not sure. There's a lot of beautiful manga, but I don't know what exactly you're looking for."
manga,3dqw7p,fredheynes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I added some of my favorite titles in the OP so that might help. Anything kind of similar to the anime titles I mentioned would be good too. I generally like somewhat odd and weird things. For example I really enjoyed the odd settings and narratives in angel's egg, evangelion or lain. I liked the puzzle-like exposition where it was kind of the viewers responsibility to put the elements together and know what was going on. I also like weird settings in general, I don't like typical medieval fantasy but I like obscure, unique fantasy like in dorohedoro (manga), bas-lag by china mieville (books), morrowind or planescape (books). I like sci-fi too, especially cyberpunk (gits, lain, ergo proxy, tex, alita, eden) but I dislike the ones with the more edgy or unsubtle aesthetic like Akira, Cyber City Oedo or Genocyber. I guess you could say I like post-cyberpunk more. Not really a fan of space operas, I find them rather visually stale. I love some styilized, weird-ish sci-fi settings like Kaiba or Casshern Sins.  As for characters the only real preference I have is for strong female characters, really two types. One is the independent and empathetic types like Nikaido, Nausicaa and Erin. The other is the more strong, but sometimes a bit crazy or even mentally damaged ones like Nanjou Sachi, Hitagi, Misato or Revy.  Besides the abstract, surreal and weird I'm going on about I'd say I like more psychological stories when it comes to genre. I've generally prefered seinen, I dislike battle shounen but I haven't tried many other demographics so I might find something in shounen or josei I'd like but I just don't know. I loved Utena and that's shoujo."
manga,3dqw7p,rasenganbeast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:36 2015 UTC,Since you like yoshitaka amano's art ( angels egg) why not try the vampire hunter d books. They are light novels though with yoshitaka amano's art. He also has some art books if you are into it.  For manga....well there is natsume book of friends. The art is not the best but it has this ethereal air about it. I found it to be quite surreal.  Jinjo ito's manga is surreal but more on the horror side.
manga,3dqw7p,ThelMi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"Well, actually I did watch Natsume the anime. I can't say I was really a fan of it, I liked Mushishi and Mononoke a lot more which were in a similar vein. I really do like Yoshitaka Amano's art, I saw his designs for the final fantasy games and honestly I liked the a lot more than the actual games : D. So I might check his art books out. I'm not really interested in light novels. I treat books as a seperate medium and look for different things in it than in anime/manga (since they are visual mediums). So I rarely read lns or genre fiction but rather stick to literature."

So many anime are adapted from manga instead of produced originally.  Scale down and we find the same thing true for manga vs. light novels in particular.  A novel might only be a handful of people relative to a manga especially where writing, drawing, and editing require more investment.  A built-in fan base from an already successful novel series helps ensure financial success.  Rinse and repeat.  It's essentially a content assembly line.  It's almost like the Hollywood motion picture system.  And it's sick because what's hurt are the indie efforts.  (Which is just like Hollywood.)"

manga,3dmrwu,ZedOPasfuck,4,Fri Jul 17 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the grand prize winner is a bit lacking story wise, I love the first half (the child dreaming of being an astronaut) but once it's been established that she actually became one, it ... doesn't do much with it (maybe she wants to go back to Earth or misses her mother / older sister but there really isn't much emotion).  I would have liked the story better (entirely subjective) if we followed the little girl through the years (standing up in class probably explaining her dreams, studying, working hard, training) ... hell, you could probably even stop the story before the actual launch with the girl looking at her helmet or the mother watching her on TV with the reflection of the mother perfectly aligning with the helmet the same way it did at the beginning.  But hey, I love cliché stories and it's probably really hard to tell a fulfilling story in such a short amount of pages without dialogue, I did like Without You more story-wise, almost teared up at the end though most stories in that competition use death/abandonment as a way to get you to tear up, feels a bit like cheating at this point, it's way harder to make a good and happy silent story."

manga,3dmrwu,anindecisiveguy,19,Sat Jul 18 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"I have some opinion that I hope can help you.   One problem that I have with your story is that while the theme and the message are great, the story itself is a little weak. There's no climax for the story. The three situations are just variations of the same thing, sitting down then see someone and give the seat to them.   What I suggest is just to have the 1st guy and the old lady as the main characters. You can show the guy going through a hard and tired day, having trouble and bad luck through the whole day, and he only finds comfort in having a seat on the subway. Then you show the old lady and his thought process like you did here. That would be better IMO.  It's still a good work anw. I hope you can one day achieve your goal."

manga,3dmrwu,anindecisiveguy,3,Fri Jul 17 19:49:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the story was a huge issue, I thought the art was most glaring issue. Not that it was bad, but since OP went for a simple, stylized approach, you aren't really showcasing your fullest extent as an artist. Other contestants had very clean line art in styles that suited their story. If you go a simple art route, which some also did, you better have a story that blows others away. That being said, I really did enjoy the oneshot, I think OP has the potential do well next year."
manga,3dmrwu,aimanicose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"It's a story most of us can relate to, we all have parents and grandparents, we've all been kids at some point, we meet these sort of characters pretty often, we hopefully learned some basic etiquette and no matter how sweet that free seat could be after a long tiring day, there might be someone who needs it more.  I agree with you, we only need to see the struggle of the first character, what led him into that train and what got him so tired he lunged towards that seat without thinking about it twice. It's a simple thing and a situation we can easily understand, who wouldn't want that seat ? Why does it feel so weird and disappointing to give up on that seat even though deep down you not only know it's the right thing to do but have already made up your mind the second you saw that elderly woman anyway.  Seeing the older woman give up the seat afterwards is ... why not I guess, it fits the overall theme of the story and I love reading up stuff where everyone is kind and shows a lot of empathy towards others, but still, the flashbacks were uneccessary, it's probably better to leave it up to our imagination."
manga,3dmrwu,Schmuck_God,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's nothing bad about the latter part of the older woman giving up seats. But when it repeats three times, it does not contribute much to the story. At least from how I view it, if the story just ends when the guy giving up the seat, it will not change or reduce much to the message here either."

I wouldn't say it's NOT interesting, but compared to the others, it is a feels a little bland due to the almost similar scenarios. Hope you don't take offense at this, and good luck! :)"
manga,3dq5rl,the-adolescent,5,Sat Jul 18 10:49:10 2015 UTC,"Point one: I read exclusively on my laptop so I don't have a great idea of what the best apps are, but I've heard good things about Mangarock. a little research will probably go a long way for you there.  Point two: There's are legitimately thousands of series out there, and the huge amount of material in so many different genres is one of the coolest things about starting to read. I think you'll probably want to start with some series that have finished and will likely be available on any good reading app.   A thing to keep in mind is that the term ""seinen"" describes the demographic you're looking for (men aged 18-35) and I'll reccomend in accordance with that.  Here's a top five shortlist of things you will probably enjoy based on what you're said:  ""Great Teacher Onizuka"": A classic series about the exploits of a motorcycle gang leader and third degree blackbelt who becomes a teacher for initially dubious reasons. Read the first half dozen or so chapters before you make a judgment call as to the series' motives.  ""Fullmetal Alchemist"": In a world that bears a strong resemblance to Europe during the industrial revolution, there are people who can use a power known as Alchemy to change the world around them. However, two young brothers commit the ultimate alchemical taboo and meddle with life itself, suffering disastrous consequences. This is quite possibly one of the best action/adventure series ever written.  ""Kingdom"": Not completed but over 400 chapters in, this story is a heavily dramatized account of the first emperor of China's rise to power and the story of one of his greatest generals. I'd favorably compare it to a super high energy ultraviolent dynasty warriors storyline.  ""All You Need is Kill"": A short manga adaptation of the japanese novel of the same name which just so happens to be the book that Tom Cruise's 'Edge of Tomorrow' is based on. A tight, excellently illustrated work that doesn't pull any punches.  ""Wakusei no Samidare/The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer""(I have seen both the original Japanese and English translation used frequently to refer to this series): Beast Knight Sir Noi Crezant, talking lizard and herald of hope to a world in danger, is tasked with gaining the help of college student Amimiya Yuuhi for the express purpose of saving the earth from a calamitous end. However, Yuuhi is anything but a hero, and perhaps the kind of man who would rather see the world end...? This is a quirky series that has a fair depth of emotion hid behind its ridiculous premise and cartooney art."
manga,3dq5rl,Assaultkitten,2,Sat Jul 18 11:34:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you (and others who left a comment) for spending time and giving some great info about questions i asked.   It seems i was looking for the word ""seinen""! Will check all your recommendations."
manga,3dq5rl,Shivin302,2,Sat Jul 18 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"Mangarock suffers from an atrocious broken pages problem when reading from Batoto (the best source). I highly recommend Mangawatcher, especially since it got an update last week"
manga,3dq5rl,TheBattleToaster,7,Sat Jul 18 15:22:30 2015 UTC,Check out Holyland!
manga,3dq5rl,Volandum,3,Sat Jul 18 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"I must differ with most other commenters on what ""realistic"" or ""mature"" means. Indeed, I'd consider most shounen ruled directly out. My recommendations are as follows.   Sabu to Ichi is a story about detective work in Japan before the turn of the last century. Fits all your criteria, and it's a classic by possibly the most respected mangaka of all time.  Spice and Wolf is more fantasy, with a little adventure. An economically savvy merchant and his ageless, divine companion travel around exploring their world.  You've been recommend GTO and Hammer Session! is another fun teacher manga, but for your requirements I think Dragon Zakura better suited - it's more realistic, with mundane students and realistic approaches to learning, and the art is good.  Team Medical Dragon was an excellent series until the author died and it started shambling around as a corpse, which it does to this day. Jin is the best medical manga I know and indeed my favourite manga to read, but I'm not sure you like the time travel concept. So I'll recommend another classic - The Tree in the Sunlight.  Finally, I'll recommend one of my own projects. There's a supernatural element to the premise, but the characters of Sakuranbo Syndrome are mature working adults who work on their relationships sensibly and with patience."
manga,3dq5rl,Volandum,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, by calling 'mature' , I  wasn't mentioning about gore, violence,  erotica or even over-caricaturistic characters.   I was talking about drama, relationships and other ordinary life subjects."
manga,3dq5rl,quantindo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:03 2015 UTC,That's what you'll get in the projects I mentioned. Sakuranbo is about drama and relations between sensible adults. Dragon Zakura is a harsh but sensible and positive look at secondary education.  Let me know what you think/what you end up discovering about your tastes and we can provide more recommendations.

Or she's just naturally a rotten person and the writer is trying to emphasize it because it's relevant to what happens later.

A lot of times, someone who thinks they have below-average looks can become very attractive if they put effort into grooming themselves and wearing clothing that fits properly.

manga,3dlx4b,Sleepytimer,6,Fri Jul 17 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"I always wondered how this series would progress in terms of its villains. In the Ark arc (heh) they were pretty much straight up bad guys but over time they really grow on you, and the whole ""We're actually apostles"" thing confuses me on whether they're legit baddy villains (I mean, they make Akuma and all but y'know).  I don't want Road or Tyki to die either. Love those two, especially when they're friendly with Allen."
manga,3dlx4b,ShiroYashaa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:22:25 2015 UTC,I don't think so. This is my speculation but since the Earl was split into two beings then the Noah memory of the Earl must also be re-inherited. In this case I assume Nea while getting the similar powers of the Millennium Earl did not inherit the Earl's Noah memory while Mana did. Seeing Mana being pulled into the Noah family could be one of the reasons why Nea killed the previous Noah family except for Road and Mana (Who influenced by the Noah memory kills Nea).

manga,3dlx4b,newbatthis,8,Fri Jul 17 13:44:18 2015 UTC,I loved this series back when they first assaulted the Earl's place and the MC fought the Earl the first time. After that the series just went full on wtf. Monthly serialization didn't help my lack of understanding either.  Oh and the anime has some killer opening songs.
manga,3dlx4b,InTheOtherWorld,5,Fri Jul 17 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"Let's all talk about how adorable little-Road was this chapter. Like, Jesus. It was good to see the Noah again.  I had foreseen the ""Mana is the Earl"" twist for some time now, but goodness I wasn't expecting that Mana and Nea were once the original Earl! If the Earl is only at half of his strength right now, that's a big problem. Oh my.  I have a feeling that the Earl came into contact with the Heart, whoever that is, because I'm relatively confident that only the Heart could make him go to such extreme levels as reverting himself into two babies (or perhaps he had a reason to: maybe he wanted to feel human again, or he wanted a break from the war, or he wanted to be with someone he loved (Katrina (Nea and Mana's ""mother"") seems a relatively good candidate for this)). It should also be noted that Young!Mana bears a heavy resemblance to Past!Earl.   I'm assuming that what is going on, which is making it very confusing for some, is that the Earl (meaning Mana, Nea, and the Suit) is undergoing a huge personality crisis. They were all once the same person, and now that they've been split up it's all very messy. When the Earl split, he formed two babies. One was Mana, who is kind, and the other is Nea, who is cruel. Both form two polar sides of the Earl (both can control and pilot the Ark, and their swords (one of which Allen inherited) match, but with inverted colours from each other). What is left behind is that fat-man suit that we all know the Earl for, that has been embodying the human Earl for over 7000 years. It represents the Earl, and is seemingly his main power. Now without a vessel, it became a ""mad puppet"", as Nea mentioned. It chased down the twins to get its host back, and is probably the closest thing to the Earl that's left (note that when the Suit stood before the tree in 218, and Mana and the lifeless Nea in 219 it had no hands, just empty sleeves). It probably has a mind of its own after being active for so long. When the Earl as we knew him acted kind, it was Mana resurfacing, but when he becomes dark it is the Suit taking over again. ""Mana is the cause of everything"" is the Suit talking, and he's using Mana's body against his will to say it (you can see Mana's body crying and in anguish as he talks to ""Allen"" in 219). When Mana left the Suit to hug Nea!Allen, Hoshino put a lot of emphasise on the Suit disappearing behind him. As soon as it disappeared, Nea became more alert and Mana stopped acting so pitiful, becoming much darker instead. That was because the Suit went back inside him, and took over again.   The night that Allen made Mana into an Akuma, all three sides of the Earl were present. The one that looked like the Earl was the Suit, Allen (unknowingly) embodied Nea which is almost certainly why he wasn't killed, and Mana was the Akuma Skeleton. When the Earl says ""I have always wondered why I didn't kill him"", it isn't the Suit that's talking, it was from the perspective of Mana, who at the time was an Akuma Skeleton and by right should have killed Allen to make a new Akuma. Yet he didn't, hence why he always wondered. When Allen exorcised him, the Skeleton wasn't actually killed. It held on long enough to be reclaimed by the Suit, and thus one half of the Earl, the Earl we know, is formed.  When Nea says he'll ""kill the Earl"", he most likely means the Suit, so that he and Mana could be free. Or, as I suspect, Nea really is the darker side of the Earl and he wants full reign over the more gentle side that is Mana. Mana is always weak and unstable, and although Nea experienced defeat he has always been very much in control. Nea's exact words were ""I'll kill you and become the Earl myself!"" – which could mean that he takes over as the controller of the Suit aside from Mana, because Mana represents the Earl's weakness and must disappear (that could also be why the Earl split – to remove the weak part of him).  Some interesting things to point out:    When Nea takes over Allen, it always puts more emphasise on his right eye. This is significant because Allen's left eye was cursed by Mana. Not only is Allen a representation of both the humans and the Akuma, he now also holds the two opposite sides of the Earl born on him. Some have mentioned the similarities of Apocryphos and the Noah Memory. Also at the start of Kanda's flashback – onwards, the Innocence has been shown as a limbless torso with wings and without a head. The Noah Memory has always been shown as a simple, bald head with a large, smiling mouth, and occasionally with arms but no visible torso. I have a theory that the two have a common ancestor, but fell out for whatever and have been fighting ever since. There has always been an emphasis on how much each hates the other.   TL;DR I can understand the confusion, but personally I don't find it that confusing, and I'm loving making more theories for this crap. I love the way DGM is heading, and that whole time without us really knowing it has always been about the Earl. And DGM's mindfudgery is still nothing compared to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles', holy shite."

manga,3dlx4b,JBrambleBerry,-4,Sun Jul 19 08:04:07 2015 UTC,I just hate the art style now. It's not bad but it's just distracting so much different from the previous darker style it feels like it takes away from characters instead of adding to them.
manga,3dlx4b,Kniij,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:08:21 2015 UTC,"Lol why - points for this one? Its true her old art style is much better. But maybe its the wrist thing, thats why shes being conservative with her art ever since her hiatus."

manga,3dlx4b,JBrambleBerry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"Not really since that was before she started taking major hiatuses. It became a monthly in November 2009 after being on break for a few months, and in 2012 the hiatus became indefinite. You can say that's been her art style for longer, but she has done far more of D.Gray-man in it's original then it's new because of her infrequency, so your argument hugely ignores context."

He draws energetic, flowing lines that goes along with his sketch style very well. His lines describe form very well while being gestural. He has a great sense of composition, especially in his sense of location and use of landmarks in battle scenes. Nakaba makes the environment alive to the reader by letting you know where exactly the characters are at different points of a battle. Great fundametals w/ figure drawing, has a great grasp of poses that he can draw characters from all angles. This has the added benefit of him being able to play around w/ the ""camera"", using extreme angles that add to the dynamics of a scene. Just the general feel of his drawing, especially how he draws foliage and environments, reminds me of the way painters sketch.   tl;dr - Nakaba's work has the feel of someone who has had some traditional fine art training, and is using it very well to draw shonen manga."

His art style is more realistic than most traditional shounen manga artists and he also goes into great detail to portray the world around them. The space in his pages is full - but not crowded - and goes to great length to portray a surprising amount of detail. Beyond that, his ability to draw characters is somewhere amongst the top artists in the industry and because of that, it's easy for people to get hooked into his works.  Now.

And compared to which traditional shounen? One Piece and Dragon Ball are the ones I can come up with on the spot that look very unrealistic but there are a lot of traditional Shounen who go for a more realistic approach as well( Bleach, One Punch Man, Death Note, Kuroko No Basket, Slam Dunk, D.-Gray Man). Being a Shounen doesn't automatically mean the art is unrealistic, Shounen is a huge genre which covers pretty much all kinds of artstyles. You could say that its realistic compared to Shoujos though.  Also every single character he draws look the same only with different hair. His backgrounds are on point though, I give you that.  He isn't a standout artist at all everything considered. He's not bad either though, he's just average."

The author of Naruto is friends/rivals with the author of One Piece and even included the series' logo on the Hokage statue headband in the final chapter (700). It's also part of the Big 3. Bleach. A lot of people have mixed feelings about it but it's alongside Naruto and One Piece as part of the Big 3 for a reason. Boku no Hero Academia. This one is still fairly new but it's great. Assassination Classroom. Seems to be wrapping up but it's another fantastic series. Bakuman. It's completed and by the same authors as Death Note. Totally different feel and genre though and instead about a duo's struggle to break into the manga industry. All you need is Kill. This one's just by the same artist as Death Note's but has a different author. It's only about 2 volumes long but it's another good read.

manga,3dlj7h,BraveDude8_1,13,Sat Jul 18 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"So, they were watching him for a while it seems. Since he left the company after Saiki died, and then he started to fail to get into jobs, they couldn't have just been watching him after many failed attempts.   Going on this, if they observed him at the grave, then they must have been considering him for a much longer period than was necessary, before he even started doing bad.  One possibility is brought up then about the ReLIFE program is all about. It can't simply be about people who cannot find a job for some reason, there are plenty of people out there in the same situation.  It could be a program meant to help people get over the death of someone close to them who committed suicide, and for those who witnessed their body. This is naturally a traumatic experience for anyone, and it would affect anybody's perspective on life. By regressing them to the life of a child, you are open to the possibilities of what you were like as a kid when times were simpler, and seeing other children grow up around you, you can begin to appreciate life again. By shaping the other children's futures, you can avoid a similar situation for them by giving them worldly advice from one who has witnessed death and betrayal.  I had an even more radical theory, but I believe it is even more unlikely..."
manga,3dlj7h,TurbanatorUK,7,Fri Jul 17 06:50:07 2015 UTC,The whole relife thing is really ambiguous. We don't really know much about their intentions except some basics.

I wonder though why ReLIFE was chosen to promote VISA, not really seeing the connection right there.  Also damn this chapter was a bit heavy handed yet it's understandable considering the situation. What's still bugging me is that it's apparently way too convenient for the characters to ""change age"" at will. With that kind of technology you'd think they would be selling it at a steep price instead of doing this experiment. Or maybe that's just the capitalist in me speaking."

Takaya said that the sequel manga is meant to commemorate the release of the collector's edition. Takuya added that while those who have never read the original will be able to read the sequel, those who have read the manga will get a good laugh out of the new series.

manga,3dj2zo,Blurted,8,Fri Jul 17 03:48:44 2015 UTC,Highly recommend it. It's widely considered the manga that kickstarted/defined the harem genre.
manga,3dj2zo,Captain_BDS,2,Fri Jul 17 04:38:41 2015 UTC,I thought Tenchi Muyo was the OVA that kickstarted the harem genre.

manga,3dj2zo,Lord_Ray5555,15,Sat Jul 18 18:43:40 2015 UTC,Just gonna start off that it has a satisfying ending. But there's so much group travelling with little development then it returns to status quo. Then a MASSIVE development within 4 chapters then back to status quo.

Shaft's previously had some shows where they got some information on the story ahead of the manga they're adapting (Like Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei), so who's to say they didn't cast him for his ability to be a harem lead, but for his abilities in those kinds of roles, huh?  Who's to say your prediction won't come true and the next arc is Raku masterminding some serious gang wars, and manages to tear them all down from the inside and with his tactical genius? Who's to say this won't take a belated turn into Medaka Box territory, slowly spiraling into insanity and ever larger conflicts? Who's to say the constant returning to the status quo was only Komi baiting us, and didn't have some deeper meaning, yet to be revealed?

And even if they did somehow get there, it'd hardly be enough to take on a massive collective of triads.

This is just speculation but while I don't think she'll die, I do think she'll end up leaving for somewhere less stressful or somewhere that has facilities to help her.   As for Onodera, the Christmas thing was literally nothing. Neither of them were able to confirm anything but it did hint that they're beginning to realize their feeling for each other. The thing that renders this useless is the fact that Raku is questioning his feeling for her and is beginning to lean towards Chitoge.   The plot's been moving. Just subtly and extremely slowly. We're pretty much able to confirm who's not going to be chosen though that's been pretty obvious from the beginning. Especially with that oneshot."

manga,3dj2zo,accountmadeforants,17,Fri Jul 17 04:04:09 2015 UTC,And next week Raku wakes up from his coma after realizing he had amnesia because of Chitoge's knee to the face in the first chapter.
manga,3dj2zo,DahjerCanaan,10,Thu Jul 16 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"And when that reality gets too ""progress-y"", it turns out he was still in a coma, but from when he got that scar on his forehead.  However, despite all those years having passed, all the harem members are still there because of the key promise.  ...which finally makes the key promise and scar remotely relevant again. Shit."

manga,3dj2zo,sleepslacksnooze,11,Thu Jul 16 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"This is without a doubt the most actual plot progression in a chapter to date. We got a confession, a rejection, the removal of one part of the harem and perhaps most importantly real signs that Raku's starting to realise he likes Chitoge. I may be a naive idiot but I believe this is the beginning of the end, though it will still be slow and frustrating."

But for Nisekoi, can you really say any of them 'bad'? They are fucking entertaining and great in their own right that I can't really cast them away like other manga."
manga,3dj2zo,DirtBug,6,Thu Jul 16 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you, each girl is great in their own way, which is why I think we'll all come to appreciate the plot-less chapters when Nisekoi ends."

manga,3dj2zo,DirtBug,3,Thu Jul 16 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"doesnt mean any harm yet but who knows how far she might go, especially if she gets rejected  and she literally kidnapped him, thats more then a bit crazy"
manga,3dj2zo,Forikorder,5,Thu Jul 16 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna be an asshole but...I find Kosaki completely boring. She hasn't really had many funny moments although that is because she is the shy one. Tsugumi's random intense violence, flash of hitman sides are great. Gorilla kun has chemistry with Raku and they work well together, I ship them. I don't have to mention how great Marika is. I even like Haru more than Kosaki, I just don't know why. I get they're all great, I just never saw the greatness in Kosaki."
manga,3dj2zo,SmexyPro,7,Fri Jul 17 00:03:09 2015 UTC,Onodera is the homely gentle wife everyone dreams about while Haru is just Chitoge in Onodera's skin. I'd say that's pretty great in itself.

manga,3dj2zo,5thEagle,7,Fri Jul 17 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"if this ended as a harem manga, Nisekoi is become just mediocre. With the passage of time, it will just be refereed to as "" another harem manga"". If the author has the balls not to fuck with us and actually sink down the other ships, it will really be something that can set it apart as a series that actually strives for an ending."
manga,3dj2zo,Ataniphor,3,Fri Jul 17 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Harem endings are actually really rare. The vast majority of harem light novels and mangas have an ending with one girl, its just most of the time we never get the full adaptation in English, so we think that it's open based off of incomplete adaptations.  I don't think Nisekoi would work with a harem ending anyway (I kinda like the idea of having one main ending, and then publishing some 'alternative universe' endings for the other girls), just saying that the archetype isn't nearly as common as you might think."

Does this mean all the girls are gonna get the confess/reject route until its left to chitoge and onodera?  Is marika already out because of her latest arc so we should consider her rejection super incoming?  I hope chitoge doesnt win.

So here it is, when Komi's serious he's a really good romance writer. I loved this chapter so much. Page 8 was epic (Chitoge best girl confirmed) and I think it's time for Raku to think about it carefully. Raku answered seriously and directly, without any stupid gag or something. Was about time! Lastly, that kiss was really, really sweet.    So here's what I think about the all matter. No more trolling (in this arc and I hope in the rest of the manga). Yui-nee's going to go away, more adult (title) and with a proper closure (last page)."

For example all girls decide to confess around the same time and it branches off into each girls ending but there's no way that'd happen and I knew all along but S.S Onodera's pretty much sunk... Sad days."

manga,3dj2zo,Donimyc,4,Fri Jul 17 00:03:00 2015 UTC,The only logical answer to this progression right now is that Komi's assistants; filled with rage at the lack of progression have locked him away and are completing the series themselves.

manga,3div71,xaxzzzaz,0,Fri Jul 17 20:50:12 2015 UTC,You.... hadn't? There were tons of Cap comparisons being drawn to All Might when he was first introduced...
manga,3div71,5thEagle,3,Fri Jul 17 08:15:02 2015 UTC,They were talking about Deku.
manga,3div71,thenekkidguy,-2,Fri Jul 17 11:04:54 2015 UTC,Deku is extremely similar to All Might. The similarities are meant to extend.

manga,3div71,PakiIronman,20,Fri Jul 17 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"I wonder why the Hero Killer wants more real heroes. Maybe he was a hero once with the facets of good and evil like Sparky Sparky Boom boy and was betrayed by selfish heroes or tried stopping them, leaving him with the desire to kill them all?  I'm enjoying how this manga is growing and shaping up."
manga,3div71,Bromojo,11,Thu Jul 16 18:12:41 2015 UTC,Maybe endeavor had something to do with it.
manga,3div71,Haniho,14,Thu Jul 16 20:55:58 2015 UTC,It would explain his appearance in this chapter.  It might also be interesting if Stain had his face burnt beyond recognition to lead him to become a villain.
manga,3div71,solidfang,13,Thu Jul 16 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Just a guess, based on tropes and such: He watched his family or someone important to him* die (and got the scars) as part of the collateral damage of a fight between some heroes and a villain.  *(Or hell, maybe just a bunch of innocent civilians.)"
manga,3div71,accountmadeforants,11,Thu Jul 16 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"Or maybe he was injured helping people, but he didn't get recognition because he wasn't popular or his methods were not heroic (killing villains?)."

manga,3div71,5thEagle,0,Fri Jul 17 08:24:31 2015 UTC,I think a huge problem with Naruto Shippuden is that there wasn't a crew battle to show the powers of the side characters. Because of that the side-characters really got gimped and were mostly Jobber+ status.

Also, about rehashing tropes, I didn't mean there were no common tropes between this and other manga. What I meant was that this manga has actual substance, and it is only complemented by tropes. The story/characters/everything is creative and exciting rather than just being a rehash of tropes, like most of the garbage that calls itself shonen manga these days."

manga,3div71,WillBlaze,5,Thu Jul 16 20:26:09 2015 UTC,In a previous chapter it sounded like Deku was foreshadowing that something happened to Iida.

manga,3diftq,rizenfrmtheashes,23,Thu Jul 16 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"So, there seems to be a good chance that leveling to 100 for Gnome involves building an emotional relationship with the spirit. Something we see heavily foreshadowed in this chapter. This could also be death flags for Gnome or troll death flags to the brink of death, that forces her to evolve to the next state.   In other news, I was not expecting diabetes this chapter :3"
manga,3diftq,seanthemanpie,17,Thu Jul 16 16:37:09 2015 UTC,I think with the level 100 foreshadowing a death flag is unlikely

manga,3dk4sn,rtwpsom2,7,Thu Jul 16 22:35:14 2015 UTC,"A few weeks back I was watching Hamada Yoshikazu's live stream and he spent a few days doing some very nice color drawings. Not being able to understand Japanese I could only guess why, but it turns out they were for the cover and a color spread in this months Gekkan Action (Monthly Action), published by Futabasha.   Around the same time /u/volandum from Norway Scans shared a copy of the digital version of Weekly Shonen Magazine with me.  It was enormous. Hundreds of pages and chapters from dozens of series. It blew my mind how much content was in it.  By this point I was really curious to see a serial in real life so when I saw a copy of Gekkan Action for sale at CDJapan I bought it.  I just got it today.  This thing is huge.  It's easily twice the size of tankobans, but oddly light.  It is reminiscent of old phone books, but maybe half the weight, and the drawings are so large in comparison to the tankobans. I don't know how they make them so cheap, it was only $5.25 (plus $7 for shipping), which is less than most magazines here in the states, though I know most magazines are made from glossy paper and the serials are made from pulp. Still, this is 5 times as thick as a US magazine easily. Anyway, another dose of my ramblings for you."
manga,3dk4sn,Kep0a,2,Thu Jul 16 22:44:13 2015 UTC,CDJapan    Where are you located? My shipping charges are showing up as around 25$ for the US.
manga,3dk4sn,Kep0a,2,Sat Jul 18 22:48:30 2015 UTC,"Washington state. I ship SAL. I paid $12.91 total. $4.85 for the monthly and $8.06 for shipping. My numbers were slightly off, I guess I remembered wrong, but you shouldn't ever pay $25 shipping for one serial or tankoban.  And to be completely transparent, I didn't actually pay anything, I used points for that order but the yen total was ¥1602."
manga,3dk4sn,Kep0a,2,Sat Jul 18 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"Okay just checked your exact issue and I can get it for that cheap enough shipping, cool. Other magazines shipping was weirdly more expensive though. ): edit: 11 dollar for jump SQ, so not much more  How long did it take to get to you?"
manga,3dk4sn,-tuhbakee-,2,Sat Jul 18 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"For SAL they are pretty accurate when they estimate 1-3 weeks.  I have gotten them 8 days after shipping, I have gotten them 20 days after shipping, and everywhere in between. I have never ordered any other serials so if they are the same size but the paper quality is different they could be a lot heavier. Like I said, it's the size of a phone book. I am sure the weight is the prime consideration when shipping, and not the size."
