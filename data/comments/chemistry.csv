Purification of the crude material you get from that sequence seems to just be recrystallization from EtOH.  Now, given no other information, I would guess they actually mean that they bubbled dry HCl gas through a 9:1 mixture of EtOAc/EtOH until it was saturated, rather than adding some quantity of fuming HCl. Regardless, there's a decent shot that what you attempted will work. You may just have a good bit of conc. HCl you will have to get rid of from your product.  Good luck!"

It's fine to use in a bath, aside from the fact that it is one of the more expensive solvents. If you don't need the temp to be exactly -40, I would say use acetone as solvent and monitor the temp while slowly adding dry ice.  If you use acetonitrile, obviously read the MSDS first for any precautions- but I treat it the same way I treat any other organic solvent. Keep in a fumehood, wear proper PPE, etc.   To make the bath, you should use a dewar that is an appropriate size for your reaction. I usually add the dry ice first, then slowly add the solvent (it will bubble vigurously, so be careful). It's probably useful to have a low temp thermometer to monitor the temp as well."

Concepts and mechanisms from O Chem 1 are likely to some degree ""easy"" for you at this point (potentially with a quick refresher), but are really difficult for someone learning it for the first time. The things you learn in the first year of grad school feel relatively ""easy"" to me now, but I remember it wasn't that way at the time.

With this option, you can practice doing mechanisms (think: one chapter a week!) and learn tons of chemistry! There is also this book made by a fellow redditor for free, or buy the print copy for $18. I've only skimmed through this book but its visually stunning! You can't go wrong with organic chemistry for dummies, either. Read the reviews!  The second option is that you can use online sites, such as Wikipedia, Khan Academy, organic-chemistry.org, or even  sparknotes. Khan Academy is a great place to start, although admittedly I do not think they are nearly comprehensive enough (that is, having a lot of different RXNs, mechanism). Typing ""organic chemistry"" into youtube also yields dozens of playlists, that look quite promising!  With any of the options it is imperative that you get a pen and paper and actually write out the mechanisms several times, and follow the logic (nucleophile to electrophile, etc) in your head!

That being said, it makes me wonder if these tenured professors staying in the workforce so late into life are preventing new scientists from being hired into tenure track positions. I know at my university, there has been funding cuts by the government and some tenured professors took voluntary severances, forcing them into an earlier retirement."

If it was up to me to figure out I'd probably just go about researching the reaction and finding it in literature. The way I was taught orgo we never really needed to figure this stuff out on our own, so I'd love to see how people go about doing that."
chemistry,3dxkwz,dmso-d6,4,Mon Jul 20 21:06:50 2015 UTC,"At first you can look on the overall transformation without even looking what is above and below the arrow. Aldehyde was transformed into alkyne, so we need a C-C forming reaction with C1 unit and deoxygenation. Carbonyl group is naturally electrophilic on carbon, so some nucleophile must attack this position. When you see a base as a reagent there is damm high probability that something will be deprotonated - look for acidic protons. In the system (excluding the THF) there are 4 types of hydrogens. ArCH, COH, HN2PO and CH3PO. Now, knowledge what makes a given proton more acidic than the others is crucial. In a nutshell, the more stabilized the resulting anion (less basic) the more acidic is the corresponding acid. In this case, proton alpha to phosphorus is the most acidic because it is stabilized by the phosphonate group by resonance. After deprotonation there is a carbanion which is going to attack something. Now we are looking for electrophiles. There is benzaldehyde floating around, let's attack it. Looking back to point 1 we have make a necessary C-C coupling, now it is time to ged rid of the oxygen. At this point it helpful to know that phosphorus likes oxygen (P=O bonds are very strong). There are some other important reactions in org. chem which make use of this affinity (Wittig, Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons, Corey-Fuchs). Rest of the mechanism is classical from the reactions above (formation of oxaphosphetane and fragmentation). Only the very end step may be troublesome to figure out (1,2-hydride shift on a carbene), but you won't usually see it very often. In generall, If you would like to know more about org chem and be able to solve mechanisms I highly recommend reading and learning from the book: The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms + learning most important name reactions."

However I'll try to answer as best I can.  Basically, a lot of the perfumery world isn't traditional chemistry as one would think. Perfumery is mostly derived on the senses alone rather than any reactions that might take place. Aditionally, one fragrance might consist of 100+ compounds, so reactions are very hard to predict. That said, some components are certainly more reactive than others. Usually compounds are thought of in terms of their intrinsic reactivity rather than how they might react with another specific component (if that makes sense). Additionally, certain components are more hazardous than others and are avoided. Benzaldehyde for example can self-ignite.  One of the main chemical properties to take into account in perfumery is ""substantivity."" Basically, its a measure of how long a fragrance component will last. This tells you how strong it will smell to you initially as well.   A good place to find information on specific components is www.thegoodscentscompany.com"

chemistry,3du4pk,BSCowboy,4,Sun Jul 19 16:04:02 2015 UTC,"Chemical engineering is a diverse field and there are a lot of options for career paths. You really will have a lot of flexibility to choose. To give you some examples, during my co-op/practicums I worked in mining, pulp and paper, dairy processing, a chlor-alkali plant and at a water bottling plant. Some of these were in major cities and some in rural areas. So you really do have options to choose. Its worth noting that a lot of career options are dictated by local industries. For example, I live in Canada and many of my friends went to work in the oil and gas industry.  I currently work at a municipal consulting firm where I design pump stations and water and wastewater treatment plants."
chemistry,3du4pk,dimo0991,3,Sun Jul 19 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a Student of chemical engineering in Germany. Our universities master program is divided in two possible paths: Chemical processing (what you would consider to be aimed at working in a chemical plant or factory after graduation) and applied chemistry. The latter path focuses more on research , e.g. luminescent materials, materials science or polymers. (those topics vary between universities) For both paths a working environment located in a factory or production facility is possible but not necessary. So you can still work as a chemical engineer in several fields without necessarily working directly in a factory.  Hope I could help, sorry if I made language mistakes"

chemistry,3duxnl,Steerbeen,6,Sun Jul 19 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"I would guess that it couldn't, just because wine is so complex. There's more to it than just the alcohol produced by the fermentation, or the tannins, or all that. There are a lot of complex mixtures of many different chemicals that are all interacting in a way to provide that unique taste.  So, I guess in pure theory, many (many many many) catalysts could be used to produce all of these compounds in just the right amounts (if you knew the amounts needed and all that). Practically, I don't think it would work."
chemistry,3duxnl,DatNewbChemist,12,Sun Jul 19 19:05:42 2015 UTC,The short answer is that there are too many things going on in aging wine and at different rates for a single catalyst to influence in the way you imply.
chemistry,3duxnl,XM525754,4,Sun Jul 19 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"What makes a wine great is not age, but vintage - the specific year with great growing/weather conditions. An old wine bottled from a shitty season isn't worth saving.  Fermentation is mainly to get bacteria to convert sugar to ethanol. Anyone can make ethanol it's not particularly difficult. That's not where the quality is distinguished.  As others have mentioned, there's some cultural baggage. If you could produce an exact copy of a $2,000 bottle of wine for $5, and you made it known it was the result of chemical engineering, no oenophile would even deign to spit it out of their mouth. :)"
chemistry,3duxnl,redidiott,3,Sun Jul 19 23:14:01 2015 UTC,Also wine is a complex mixture containing hundreds of organic compounds at concentrations in parts per million/billion. It could not be (with the technology we have today) the result of chemical engineering trying to mimic the result of a good grape harvest.
chemistry,3duxnl,vingnote,3,Sun Jul 19 23:23:59 2015 UTC,True. I was speaking hypothetically. Like a Star Trek replicator only one that works perfectly enough to re-produce wine (and Romulan ale).
chemistry,3duxnl,redidiott,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"I would say the limiting factor is not the (re)production of a chemical composition but the analysis and determination of the actual chemical composition (what makes the aged wine taste better etc). I don't think you even need a catalyst, a ""simple"" mixture or addition of the critical components (if you can identify them, as stated above) should be sufficient."
chemistry,3duxnl,davebdrian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"A similar thing is sort of done to beer; an enzyme (acetolactate decarboxylase, I think) can be added to speed up the lagering process - the fermentation time spent that removes the 'buttery' taste of acetolactate - from days to hours.  Unfortunately this is not the only reaction that happens during the normal lagering process, and hence is why mass-market lagers (Carlsbergs etc) taste shit.  So basically good alcoholioc drinks need time to develop the complex flavours needed to taste good."

chemistry,3drq4v,butylparaben,9,Sun Jul 19 05:26:05 2015 UTC,"I use MgSO4 pretty much exclusively.  It supposedly does reduce yields by trapping product, but it is definitely much more rapid than NaSO4.  I rinse the solid MgSO4 with the same solvent and shake it around pretty vigorously and don't seem to suffer much loss of product.  Just throw scoops of the anhydrous stuff into a flask with the organic layer and swirl for a few seconds.  Add until the solid remains as fine granules and no new clumps form.  Filter it off and you should be good to go."
chemistry,3drq4v,radiatorcheese,4,Sun Jul 19 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"I like sodium sulfate just because it's easier to decant/filter off. Mostly I just chuck in whatever is closest (sodium sulfate if the molecule looks sensitive). I've heard that mag sulfate and sodium sulfate have different efficiencies for different solvents, but it's hard to pin down which combinations to use. I wonder if part of it is your filtration - gravity filtration in both cases? Glass wool for sodium sulfate - filter paper for mag sulfate? Filtering volatile solvents through filter paper often gives me a rime of ice, so if that's being washed in it could explain your water (glass wool plugs don't have enough exposed surface area for this to happen)."

chemistry,3drq4v,Iamjonh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:45 2015 UTC,Na2SO4 absorbs more per weight?

For drying solvents I use activated molecular sieves, they work extremely well for most solvents.   To answer your question: You are most likely using too little MgSO4 if you still find water in your samples. You should add enough for there to be free particles in suspension, not just lumps at the bottom. Think of a snow globe!  If you have problems with water in liquid compounds/residues, I often have success with blowing a stream of dry nitrogen into the flask for a few hours (the compound should of course not be volatile)."

If you're talking non-sensitive compounds in an acidic sense, then I'd say I still like it for it's ability to be easily filtered and added (kind of like how you said). Magnesium just doesn't fly for me. Plus I've found if I have a few electron dense neighbors (like ketones separated by a few carbons), then some product tends to stick to magnesium sulfate - not a lot, but still some.

chemistry,3dp4fi,furryscrotum,2,Sun Jul 19 00:28:01 2015 UTC,First boil some water or get it really hot then remove it from the heat source.  Then dissolve as much copper sulfate as you can in hot water. Your solution should be saturated(most salts have higher solubility in hot water).  After you have done that cool the solution down(to lower the solubility) and crystals should form on their own after some time(different chemicals take different amounts of time to crystallize) .  You can look up solubility charts for copper sulfate at different temperatures if you want to see what your theoretically yield should be  If you have good product itll look like this http://imgur.com/gallery/tyUelxw  so they look really nice. Post your results im curious to see how you can get them to come out. Also always wear gloves i think copper sulfate is an irritant

What this has meant essentially every time is that I ask them ""do you know how to do X?"" and their response to the affirmative is actually totally misleading in that they actually were not fully trained, don't understand the concept, dramatically overestimate their competence in the matter, or some combination thereof. I've had a bear of a time convincing visiting students that part of learning is being taught and isn't aided at all by bravado.  This is all to say that, regardless of where the student comes from, I always retrain them to do work to my specifications.

chemistry,3dkld5,cheezburgerlover,7,Fri Jul 17 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"I must say that I hate the attitudes of grad students who look down on undergrads as a nuisance. Many times the undergrads who are not competent is due to the poor training from graduate student or post doc. If you take the time to properly transfer your skills then you give them the opportunity to become efficiently independent researchers. To be honest there is not much difference between an undergrad and a 1st or even a 2nd year graduate student anyways, just a superiority complex. As an ""undergrad"", in my first year I published a 1st author paper, the second two authors were undergrads. In fact during my time as an undergrad in the lab no new graduate students have published anything, period. Being hard on someone is fine, as long as you are not being hard on them for the fact of being hard but rather to teach them the proper way to do something. This also varies from person to person because if someone is not good at taking creative criticism then they will quit because they think you are being hard for no other reason than being hard or that they are not good enough. You have to nurture those who you mentor to be effective, it takes time and effort and is risky because they may leave after living up to your expectations. I would also like to add that I think it is sad and pathetic that people think that undergrads are only good for washing dishes. How is anyone supposed to be engaged intellectually and technically in the lab by washing dishes?"
chemistry,3dkld5,wellwastedyouth,4,Fri Jul 17 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"I agree but attitudes seem to vary between universities. I went to school for undergrad and graduate in eastern Europe and undergraduates were almost totally unsupervised. The attitude was absolutely ""you learn by failing"". I got a copy of Vogel and a project and was told to go at it. We didn't even have access to online databases like scifinder and this was in the early 2000's.  When I was a postdoc in the US at lot of graduate students micromanaged undergrads, like on a daily basis. This was a pain because the undergraduates didn't like this and pretty much all ended up gravitating to me. I helped one of them who was very motivated out a lot and after a year, they were good enough to train new undergrads in all the basics.   I think it's optimal to have undergrads teach each other the basics. They generally have more time, work together more closely, and it can be a learning experience for both parties in the process."
chemistry,3dkld5,disposable125,5,Fri Jul 17 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"I was pretty lenient on my undergrads when I looked after them. I expect mistakes and screw-ups and the most important thing in my view is that they know they can ask questions and admit they messed up. I don't expect too much out of them - most people are pretty rubbish in the lab when they first start and the transition from structured classes to independent research is a tough one.  I was fairly hands off when it came to their actual work as well. I expected them to discuss every procedure with me first but I didn't supervise their every move because making mistakes and fixing them is important (obviously I closely monitored them if they were doing anything remotely dangerous). By the end of a semester or two with me, I expected them to be able to contribute some ideas (mostly bad), search the literature for conditions, have a first pass at interpreting NMRs and run most reactions, work-ups and columns reasonably independently while being able to ask pertinent questions. Most of this is slower than a trained grad student and I still generally set out what they would do each day but they were generally independent enough by the end that I didn't need to supervise their every move.   I was pretty strict on hours for undergrads - under no circumstances were they allowed to work past 5pm and no reactions/columns could be set up after 3pm as working longer leads to mistakes.  I will say that if your lab feels you're being too tough on them, you likely are being too tough and should ease up. If you're finding them too much to handle, then you should talk to your supervisor about assigning them to another grad student."
chemistry,3dkld5,Delphinium1,2,Fri Jul 17 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, not being able to work past 5pm seems a little harsh.

chemistry,3dkld5,intermag,8,Fri Jul 17 03:35:48 2015 UTC,I found it worked quite well actually - it makes efficiency in the lab important and prevents a lot of stupid mistakes caused by being tired or in a rush to get home. Long hours have been a hallmark of organic chemistry but I personally don't think they're required. You can get a lot done in 9-5 if you work constantly through that period - I don't work any longer than that in industry unless it's really necessary. Time management is a really underrated skill that is important to develop early in your career. I also think that it's important to have a life outside of the lab and working until 8 as an undergrad is overkill. This was my PI's philosophy as well and our lab was much happier and productive because of it.
chemistry,3dkld5,Delphinium1,9,Fri Jul 17 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"The 5PM cutoff is good for establishing boundaries, too.

I'm also a senior, but I feel like I'm in the baby stages for getting lab experience, as I JUST started working in someone's lab. I made a mistake the first day by not paying attention to the rotovap and possibly destroying one of my advisor's samples. I won't be doing THAT again."
chemistry,3dkld5,YourPureSexcellence,3,Fri Jul 17 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm currently an undergrad working in a lab doing synthetic organic chemistry.  I've been doing it for about 2.5 years now, so I've gotten pretty self sufficient for the most part, but even still I need guidance.  I would say your expectations should really be based off of what you teach him or her.  Keep in mind that the undergrad only knows what you have taught them, so anything new should come with guidance.   Depending on the undergrads experience, they can be pretty dependent on you or pretty independent. Also keep in mind that the undergrad has a larger course load than you do since he or she is taking anywhere between 3-5 classes (depending on the school) while most grad students will only take a couple classes at a time. Plus, undergrad classes are not structured to be lab friendly. I mean that as in often times undergrads need to take teaching labs and those frequently suck up 4-6 hours of a day 2-3 days a week depending on the class.  So from that. I would guess a time commitment of anywhere between 12-20 hours a week is reasonable, but again depends on their course load.  As far as actual work goes, keep in mind undergrads are still learning. Even if they've been shown a technique once, they will likely need some explaining for the second and maybe third time just so they can get the hang of it.  Also keep in mind that undergrads frequently don't see the big picture/end result. And that's not really out of not wanting to see the big picture, it's more that grad students don't keep them in the loop completely and they are probably not attending group meeting to get the big picture completely. Because of this, they may not see the next step even if it is extremely obvious to you.  I've had the privilege of working in a pretty small lab and new lab, so I have frequent interaction with my PI so I luckily have the general idea of what's happening, but even still moving forward often depends on your results from a reaction, and what is in the mind of the supervisor. So moving forward as the undergrad without guidance can be a bit of a gamble. What if you didn't actually want to run the next reaction yet? What if you wanted to do some trouble shooting to increase the yield of the one you're on?  All in all, undergrads really only know what you tell them, expecting more is unfair. If you want one who performs well, make a schedule with them that matches yours, and really tell them everything and keep communication open.  Tell them if they makes mistakes, but also don't forget to praise them when they do well. Remember, they're still learning and you're teaching them."
chemistry,3dkld5,Godoffail,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"I think the mistakes most graduate student make is that they don't foster independent thinking in their students. Think about how when you were a first year you had the professor or post doc more or less determining the direction of the project. As your grew more into your own and finished orals you now have more of a sense of where to take you projects and really only need the PI/post doc as more of a feedback/ advice support.   Now apply that same logic to an undergrad. Inteligence doesn't vary just because someone has a PhD, or a even a BA, but experience does. In addition to teaching him/her about how to safely and efficiently do reactions, you should be teaching them how to effectively do research and think critically about their problem and project. If you succeed in inspiring and influencing your undergrad will have the confidence and motivation to improve their skills on their own and only have to come to you when they encounter a problem they feel you would be better suited to solve."
chemistry,3dkld5,AlkaloidSwag,2,Fri Jul 17 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"It strongly depends on what year they are in and what classes they are currently taking.  Sophmores, 1st semester juniors, they're just replication bots. Show them how to do something then they repeat.  2nd semester juniors and seniors should get a lot less guidance. Show them scifinder ask them to look up reactions ect. They should plan/do everything on their own and ask for help when they don't know something.  If the undergrad. has a tough schedule, make sure they are putting there classes first while still maintaning their minimum number of hours working. They still need to learn this stuff! and it is way more important for them to learn in class."
chemistry,3dkld5,flick-a-bic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:33:54 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what kind of lab it is. Inorganic I would not expect too much. I think inorganic research will be relatively less undergrad friendly as there is more stuff they won't be able to do without hand holding or simply can't be expected to even attempt.   Organic or analytical I'd expect a lot more. Honestly I believe a motivated junior or senior could be just as dependable as an OK grad student in fields like organic, polymer, or analytical. Inorganic or materials no way. The issue is there is just not much intermediate level stuff for them to do. Stuff tends to be either mind numbing busy work or complex enough they become a liability in doing it."
chemistry,3dkld5,disposable125,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think I've had this person in more mind numbing projects for this very reason. Most other things are air sensitive and require glovebox work. Typically it's things that need to dissolve and mix together and maybe rotovap. Also, lots of recrystallizations. This person still can't read procedures from a notebook and follow them. They even have problems deciding on the size of glassware to use, after talking to me about it."
chemistry,3dkld5,FatSquirrels,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"This person still can't read procedures from a notebook and follow them. They even have problems deciding on the size of glassware to use, after talking to me about it.   That does sound like an issue, but it sounds like a teachable one.  I've had a couple students that wouldn't think about what they were setting up, they would just do what they did last time even if things should have been done differently for whatever reason.  Without knowing too much about your situation I would try to give them a specific reaction to run and a general procedure and then get them to map out a full start-to-finish plan including appropriate glassware, conditions, estimated timings, what they should be seeing or what might indicated completion (or whatever is appropriate for your stuff).  Sit down for as long as it takes, go through their plan and ask them to explain everything and talk through what you see as wrong.  If they manage to get that then let them run it and force them to record everything that differed from what you said.  Undergrads are generally told that these kinds of things are important but a lot of things require practice and rules of thumb that aren't always obvious.  Figuring out the size of the flask you need can be confusing if you haven't done the reaction, but you can always use a ""2x solvent amount"" or whatever rule you follow so they should be able to do that.  Based on what you have said I would try something like this and critically evaluate their progress without being mean, snarky, hovering, or doing anything else where their nerves are under attack.  If they fail badly then have a serious talk with your PI about this person's competence.  If you feel that you cannot work with this student then it could be possible that another grad student might be able to oversee them better, or they might have better affinity for another type of work if it exists.  It is also possible they shouldn't be in the lab at all, especially if there are other candidates.  My 2 cents.  Good luck."
chemistry,3dkld5,areuwakeup,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"Somewhat offtopic, but rather than making a new one:  Could someone sort of sum-up the American university process, I often see things like this and don't entirely follow. In the UK you pick your degree (in my case, Chemistry, although Pharma, Analytical etc are available) straight out of college (18/19) and follow a pretty broad course that covers analytical, organic, inorganic, lab work, polymers etc, you don't really get any module choices til final year at which point you graduate with either a BSc or an MChem if you do the extra year.  I understand that you guys get a lot more freedom in making up your yearly credits but ""having an undergrad working for [you]"" is madness to my ears."
chemistry,3dkld5,FatSquirrels,2,Fri Jul 17 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone else has actually given the broad overview yet, so I'll try.  Undergrad: Going for a bachelors degree generally requires 4 years of schooling.  Regular classes and lab classes included.  Some work in a research lab may or may not be required.  Masters degree: generally 2 years, applied to separately from your undergrad program.  A few schools offer a combined bachelors and masters program that usually just adds 1 year onto the bachelors, though in my experience that is more common for things like engineering than the hard sciences.  Thesis based track focuses on research, non-thesis focuses more on classwork and case studies.  Programs differ by school.  Generally, in chemistry at least, these people get their schooling paid for by working as a teaching assistant for the department or by grants in their research labs as a research assistant.  Doctorate: 4 years plus or minus a lot, you can usually start on a doctorate without a masters and the 2 years of masters education is just kinda lumped in at the beginning.  Lab research required.  Can also involve TAing like the masters, usually just early in your degree though.  Postdoc: after you get your PhD but before you have the clout and/or publication history to get you a real job you go work in someone's lab as a ""grad student +"".  Focus is on building your publication list, refining your skills in a particular research area, and getting out there to network.  In big research labs the advisor/PI often oversees the postdocs who oversee the graduate students who oversee the undergrad workers.  The smaller the group generally the attention of the PI moves down the list.  Sometimes postdocs work very independently as they theoretically don't need much supervision.  To sum that all up, someone that wants a PhD and doesn't take any breaks would kinda look like this.  Year 1-2: regular classwork/labwork  Year 3-4: regular classwork/labwork, extra work in a research lab  Year 5-6: graduate classwork at another school, TAing for the department and starting research in a lab  Year 7-8: classwork finished, full time researching in the lab and publishing papers (hopefully)  Year 9-10: postdoc in a lab at another school or at a national lab  Year 11: real job?  After year 4 you have a bachelors degree, after about year 6 you can get your masters, after year 8 you have your PhD."

In my lab I'm paid and don't have my own research projects, so I do basically whatever anyone asks: clean this, label these, arrange this, etc so that others can work on writing and planning experiments, meetings, etc. I also analyze samples, which frequently means troubleshooting problems with equipment or researching and adapting analytical methods, which they leave almost entirely up to me.

For a bachelors degree this seems excessive, and there are coursework based masters degrees around that generally seem to require building some kind of non-research case study that gets presented instead of novel research.  Personally, I think the field of chemistry is broad enough that research experience on the undergrad level is overkill for many.  Regular lab courses should be enough to teach you the basic broad skills you need, while research should be there for students that want to go into research right out of college or start their advanced degree."

chemistry,3digec,SynValuate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Nitronium tetrafluoroborate, NO2[+] BF4[-], is a useful nitrating agent which has several advantages over nitric acid. The oxidizing power and nitrating ability of nitric acid comes from nitronium ions which have some equilibrium in highly concentrated solutions of nitric acid.   (2) HNO3 <--> NO3(-) + H3O(+) + NO2(+)  With nitronium salts, such as the tetrafluoroborate, a nitration reaction is not limited by any equilibrium, as nitronium tetrafluoroborate is a solid ionic compound, which contains positively charged nitronium ions NO2(+). There are also some nitration reactions where the presence of the nitrate ion would prevent the desired product from forming.  I happen have a long D.I.Y. recipe for preparing it.  Nitronium tetrafluoroborate can be prepared by adding a mixture of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride gas and boron trifluoride to a solution of either highly concentrated nitric acid or nitrogen pentoxide dissolved in nitromethane. _ WARNING: Rubber gloves, an apron, and a plastic face mask are strongly recommended. All operations should be carried out in a hood. If hydrogen fluoride comes in contact with the skin, the contacted area should be thoroughly washed with water and then immersed in ice water while the patient is taken to rushed to the emergency department. Burns caused by hydrogen fluoride may not be noticed for several hours, by which time serious tissue damage may have occurred.  Note: Any operations involving liquid hydrogen fluoride must be carried out with equipment resisting hydrogen fluoride, such as fused silica, polyolefin, monel steel, or teflon. Kel-F grease is recommended for ground-glass joints. Nitronium tetrafluoroborate slowly attacks silicone stopcock grease, causing air to enter the flask. After completion of the reaction, all equipment should be washed with plenty of water. _ A 1 L three-necked polyolefin flask is provided with a short inlet tube for nitrogen, a long inlet tube for gaseous boron trifluoride, a drying tube, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath and flushed with dry nitrogen. Under a gentle stream of nitrogen and with stirring, the flask is charged with 400 ml. of methylene chloride, 41 ml. (65.5 g., 1.00 mole) of red fuming nitric acid (95%), and 22 ml. (22 g., 1.10 moles) of cold, liquid, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. 5. It is convenient to condense anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, b.p. 19.5°, from a cylinder into a small calibrated polyolefin flask immersed in a mixture of dry ice and acetone. As hydrogen fluoride is very hygroscopic, it should be carefully protected from atmospheric moisture, preferably by maintaining an atmosphere of dry nitrogen over it, otherwise by means of a drying tube. The hydrogen fluoride is then simply poured into the reaction flask. _ Gaseous boron trifluoride (136 g., 2.00 moles) from a cylinder mounted on a scale is bubbled into the stirred, cooled reaction mixture. (The temperature of the reaction is not critical, but the reaction is slower at higher temperatures because of the lower solubility of boron trifluoride in the solvent). The first mole is passed in rather quickly (in about 10 minutes). When approximately 1 mole has been absorbed, copious white fumes begin to appear at the exit, and the rate of flow is diminished so that it takes about 1 hour to pass in the second mole; even at this slow rate, there is considerable fuming at the exit. After all the boron trifluoride has been introduced, the mixture is allowed to stand in the cooling bath under a slow stream of nitrogen for 1.5 hours. The mixture is swirled, and the suspended product is separated from the supernatant liquid by means of a medium-porosity, sintered-glass Buchner funnel. Note that since free hydrogen fluoride is no longer present, filtration can be carried out with glass or porcelain equipment. _  The gooey solid remaining in the flask is transferred to the funnel with the aid of two 50-ml. portions of nitromethane. The solid on the funnel, nitronium tetrafluoroborate, is washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of nitromethane and two 100-ml. portions of methylene chloride. In order to protect the salt from atmospheric moisture during the washing procedure, suction is always stopped while the salt is still moist. The moist salt is transferred to a round-bottomed flask and dried by evaporating the solvent. At the end of the procedure the flask can be gently heated to 40–50°C (Nitronium tetrafluoroborate is thermally stable up to 170°. Above this temperature it starts to dissociate into nitryl fluoride and boron trifluoride.) The yield of colorless nitronium tetrafluoroborate is 85–106 g. (64–80%) It is stored in a wide-mouthed polyolefin bottle with a screw cap. The edge of the cap is sealed with paraffin wax after it is screwed on. Nitronium tetrafluoroborate is very hygroscopic. It is stable as long as it is anhydrous, but it is decomposed by moisture, and all transfers should be in a dry box.  _ Nitronium tetrafluoroborate slowly attacks polyethylene and polypropylene, but apparatus made of these materials will last for several preparations of the salt. _ The last part of the procedure can be used to purify nitronium tetrafluoroborate that has picked up water on standing. The impure salt is washed twice with nitromethane, twice with methylene chloride, and is dried under reduced pressure. _ For preparing the Boron Trifluoride: _ Boron trifluoride is a very toxic gas, which readily reacts with water to form metaboric acid and Fluoroboric acid, which then can further hydrolyze if excess water is present. It is a strong fluoride ion abductor, meaning it will pull a fluorine atom from many covalent compounds to form the tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4-), while leaving a positively charged cation. However, boron trifluoride is not as powerful of an abductor as antimony pentafluoride, as demonstrated by its unreactivity towards trichlorofluoromethane. _ Boron trifluoride may be prepared by heating a mixture of boric oxide and calcium fluoride with concentrated sulfuric acid. It may also be prepared by mixing 5 parts of potassium borofluoride (KBF4) with 1 part finely powdered boric oxide, then heating with concentrated sulfuric acid. The boron trifluoride, can be collected over mercury. Potassium borofluoride may be produced by heating together 2 parts boric acid, 5 parts CaF2, and 10 parts conc H2SO4. The liquid is then cooled and filtered, and a solution of a potassium salt is added. Potassium borofluoride precipitates out, and may then be recrystallized from hot water. By this method it can be prepared as anhydrous hexagonal crystals. If it is prepared instead from hydrofluoric acid, boric acid, and K2CO3, a gelatinous mass forms instead, which however forms cubic octahedral and cubic dodecahedral crystals when heated to 100degC.  Boron trifluoride also results from heating a mixture of boric oxide and calcium fluoride to a white heat in an iron pipe. Heating solid borofluorides to red heat, boron trifluoride is evolved, leaving behind metal fluorides."

I did this on a 30 g scale back in November! :) I used a similar methodology to what they mentioned in the thing you linked, but with a few changes:    I compressed the silica manually rather than tapping, just to get a compacted layer. Only then did I add solvent (ether) to check it. I didn't bother tapping. I used an old bent large spatula to compress it.  We use smaller silica.  Not sure off hand but IIRC it's smaller than what they mentioned in the thing you linked. I didn't dry load my compound, just poured it in, rinsed the flask with pentane, and added sand on top.    More relevant info:   My compound was about as non-polar as you can get (TBS-protected alcohol sticking off an alkyl chain with a terminal alkene) so the actual purification was fine. I only had three spots on my TLC: product (Rf 0.98), something (~0.7) and something else (~0.2) so my actual separation couldn't have really gone wrong.

I'll leave out the set-up, since you already have that, but my procedure is as follows:  1) Get a big, fat sinter-funnel and fill it 2/3 full with fine-grade silica gel. Tap the side of the glass gently until you have a level surface.  2) VERY IMPORTANT: Place a circular piece of filter paper on top of the silica; this is the equivalent of using sand on the top of a regular column to prevent the silica moving about.  3) With the vaccum on, pour hexane/apolar solvent to almost fill the remaining 1/3 of the funnel. You should see the solvent moving down in a horizontal line. You may need a few attempts before it flows well.  4) Open the vaccum and collect/throw out the used solvent.  5) Dry-load your compound by adsorbing onto celite. Swirl the celite with your apolar solvent and pour it into the funnel. Now you're columning!  6) You can transfer residual celite with more solvent.  7) Now switch over to your columning solvent mixture (Eg. 3:1 Et2O/Hexanes). Apply vacuum, collect solvent until column is dry, turn off vaccuum, collect your fraction. IMPORTANT POINT: Make sure the vaccuum is ON whenever you pour solvent onto the column. Otherwise the column packing will get all messed up.  8) Repeat step 7 until you've got enough fractions to get your squeaky clean compound.  Any questions, feel free to ask. Happy columning!"

I've heard someone else mention celite is the way to go with dry packing, is this kind of a universal rule?

My normal columns for this stuff doesn't really provide good visual indications of where my bands are and I end of doing the whole spot TLC plates song and dance (pretty normal).   As silly as it sounds, based off of the drawings, it looks difficult to switch out tubes or whatever is being used to collect without contamination from the previous fraction. Even with the second figure using the sep. funnel, I can't help but think that some of the previous fraction would hang out as beads and that it would ultimately get mixed in with the next fraction.

chemistry,3dj579,bishopsfinger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:13 2015 UTC,"Regarding celite for dry loading; yep its pretty universal. Its like silica which doesn't retain anything organic. I found it to be essential for dry vacuum columns, but i sometimes use it for flash too.  Regarding cross contamination of fractions, its definitely possible, but its never been a problem. Flash has some cross contamination too (at the nozzle) so its not unique to DCVC. Just apply vaccum, pour on solvent, fill the separating funnel, open vacuum, collect your fraction, and repeat. Any crossover is negligible."

I have been seeing lab workers getting reagents on their hands and continuing on without changing them. The researcher pictured should change their gloves with this level of exposure.
chemistry,3ddsuk,EdibleBatteries,23,Wed Jul 15 15:55:49 2015 UTC,That's under UV isn't it? You won't actually see most of that normally i'm guessing (probably just most of the yellow crap).

I went into industry before I went into an academic research lab. Glove habits were drilled into me in industry, but it was mentioned in the safety talk at the start of our research projects and that was about it. That would be fine if more senior people actually followed it. Even after directly asking a lot of the PhD students they still didn't seem to think there was anything wrong (or chose to ignore it) with having them on when they clearly had things on them or the odd person actually taking them off and putting them back on some time after."
chemistry,3ddsuk,Nymthae,6,Wed Jul 15 18:36:34 2015 UTC,I'd change gloves more often if they were cheaper.  Sure it's 2.5 dollars for 2 pairs...  But 2.5 dollars is a lot if the gross income a month is below 300 USD (Yay Hungary!) and you're a student.

We wear nitriles as standard, but also boxes of those dirt cheap thin vinyl gloves. Bob a pair of them on top of the nitriles not for so much protection but it means you can remove the soiled stuff easily and preserve the nitrile longer.

chemistry,3ddsuk,hoodie92,5,Wed Jul 15 19:27:01 2015 UTC,Isocyanate does permeate gloves. So if you get some on your gloves you had better be changing them or you are just holding the stuff against your skin.  If you don't change them you are much safer without gloves because you will notice the exposure directly to your skin more easily and wash your hands before worse permeation can occur.

Especially the 'older' generation tends to use IGOR, whereas most of the PhD students are using Matlab, because they are used to it from their master's theses.  In general, where the majority of the group lies will most likely indirectly decide, which language/software new people pick up. It would be hell for a new student to suddenly start using Maple here, because no one could help them, so someone with no previous experience will pick up Matlab or IGOR, most likely whichever his current supervisor is using.

Print this out and give it to your lab mates to read: http://cenblog.org/the-safety-zone/2015/01/piranha-solution-explosions/  There are a lot of issues when people who don't understand pirahna choose to use it.  Firstly, there should not have been a ""stock"" solution left out (especially unlabeled! Argh!) piranha should be made fresh prior to use.   In my opinion i don't think piranha should be sonicated as this inevitably leads to heating of the solution, which can result in explosion.  Furthermore, if the students weren't familiar with the incompatibilities of piranha with organic solvents, they may use acetone to dry the glassware after the piranha bath.  If there is ANY residual piranha left on the glassware, this can be extremely dangerous (see link).   Piranha should be a LAST RESORT for cleaning glassware.  Base baths (KOH/IPA) and/or acid baths should always be attempted first, among other things.

IMHO, bring it up with your PI and if possible have a group meeting discussing the topic. In my ol' academic lab, that's what we would have done and if multiple instances occurred, the offending parties would have some sort of discipline inflicted.  Best of luck!  EDIT: of course you can use MeOH/EtOH, acetone, other solvents to take care of some easier stuff..."
chemistry,3dek68,Morgii,4,Thu Jul 16 03:02:38 2015 UTC,Yeah you need to make a fuss.  Piranha should really be last resort since there are plenty other very aggressive cleaning solutions that don't have a propensity for explosion. Putting foil over the beaker is just dumb as fuck too.
chemistry,3dek68,ardbeg,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd be concerned with sonicating piranha. Sonication causes small bubbles in your liquid which collapse and emit a shockwave (see cavitation). This isn't something I'd be keen to do to an explosive solution. 50 mL of piranha can still make a big boom - I know someone who was sent to hospital from a piranha solution detonating on him when he accidentally added some acetone. Unless you really need exceptionally clean substrates, I'd recommend telling your lab to avoid piranha and use it as an absolute last resort.  Also unlabeled? That's a disaster just waiting to happen."

chemistry,3dek68,LincolnAR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:04:54 2015 UTC,Base baths vary by lab and person.  I prefer saturated KOH in EtOH but I know people that make mixtures with water anywhere from 5-50%.    Acid baths I've used are 6 M with water.
chemistry,3dek68,midnight-cheeseater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"To make a base bath, I would typically dissolve about 1 Kg of KOH in a couple of litres of water inside the big plastic tub the base bath was to stay in. Preferably a tub with a clip-on lid of course. Once dissolved, I would then dilute with 25 litres of IMS (85% ethanol, 10% methanol, 5% water). This is because KOH or NaOH takes ages to dissolve in neat IMS or IPA.  For an acid bath, I would fill a similar tub with about 25 litres of water (tap water is fine), then add an entire 2.5 litre bottle of 37% hydrochloric acid. Finally, mix well!  I did know a colleague who would make his acid bath with undiluted 37% hydrochloric acid - he would use 10 bottles of the stuff! Not to mention the expense, this was also somewhat dangerous for his lungs, and anyone working around him while he was washing up. I would have to leave the lab while he had his acid bath open - HCl fumes do not agree with me!"

It's high impact, people usually hold it in high esteem but if you look into the experimental part in the SI, that's very often a lot of BS, wrong stuff (how should I add a 0 molar solution of something?) or terrible looking data.

Another thing to keep in mind is that different journals (or rather, their editors) have their own pet subjects (for example, Nature Chem loooves their supramolecular chemistry).

chemistry,3ddf61,midnight-cheeseater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"Question about the production of CO from formic acid and sulfuric acid. Before anyone asks, I run a home lab, so I cannot get a cylinder of it.  I am aware of the reaction involved in producing carbon monoxide from formic acid and sulfuric acid. My question is more to do with what apparatus and conditions would be best suited to do so. I have seen it done on a small scale in a school lab, but that was over 20 years ago and I cannot remember the precise procedure used.  Is it necessary to use a Kipps gas generator apparatus to do this, or can the two reagents simply be mixed (slowly of course) in a large round bottom flask? Does heat need to be applied to force the reaction, or is it spontaneous?  The supply of formic acid I have on hand is unfortunately only 54% pure, and I am unsure as to whether this is sufficient for the reaction. Since the boiling points of water and formic acid are almost identical, it would seem that it is impossible to concentrate it further by distillation. Obviously, since there is a significant quantity of water present, the sulfuric acid would need to be added to the formic acid solution, not the other way around!  Does the sulfuric acid need to be of the common lab grade 98% strength for the reaction to work? I have on hand a supply of 91% sulfuric acid - will this be strong enough, especially considering the amount of water present in the formic acid solution?  The reason for doing this experiment is to demonstrate that carbon monoxide can be used as a fuel gas on its own. I hope to be able to fill some small balloons with the gas and ignite them (outside of course) to demonstrate its flammability."

In fact ,because the energy barrier for this oxidation is so high, cara use a catalytic converter to ensure only CO2 is emitted from the tail piper.  If you mix organics and strong acids, your going to have a bad time/a very violent exothermic reaction."
chemistry,3ddf61,midnight-cheeseater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:02:13 2015 UTC,"It's just that I had heard persistent rumours that CO burns with a beautiful blue flame, and that the experiment I described above had been done in school labs to demonstrate this.  Also, before we started using natural gas (mostly methane) as a cooking and heating fuel, we used what was referred to as ""town gas"". Apparently, this was made by destructive distillation of low grades of coal, and consisted of a mixture of hydrogen and CO. My dad is old enough to remember using a gas cooker which ran on town gas, and he told me that it burned just fine.  In fact, if what you are telling me is true about the activation energy to ""burn"" CO being too high, then every household using town gas in their gas cookers would have died from CO poisoning, since only the hydrogen component would have been combustible!  Since my dad and many others from the era of town gas use are still very much alive, this suggests that you are mistaken and that CO can indeed be used as a fuel gas."

Would then add my sample through the septum via syringe (with vent needle removed, but schlenk line needle still attached). Can either quickly replace rubber septum with a regular NMR cap, or keep the rubber septum on and cover vigurously with parafilm.

CaH2, 4 Å molecular sieves, or a plug of 10%w/v activated Al2O3 are more than sufficient to get benzene down to single-digit ppm H2O. Potassium and sodium can slowly metallate benzene to make phenylsodium or phenylpotassium, which will slowly decrease the deuterium enrichment of your solvent.  And if you're buying your solvents from Cambridge Isotopes, for much of their catalogue (and most applications) you can skip the drying step as long as you order the ampoules and open them in a nitrogen glovebox.

I routinely flame seal NMR tubes with solvent (not for NMR though) by hooking them up to a shlenk-line under static vacuum using a home-made adapter.  I don't know if you can use these for NMR though as the top is likely to be slightly deformed and the spinner supposedly can cause damage if the tube is deformed.  Another option using a similar method could be to flame seal an X-band epr tube and place it in an NMR tube. The only thing I'd be worried about with this is the EPR tube rattling about in the NMR tube. You'll need a pretty hot flame for this as well as EPR tubes are quartz.

chemistry,3dc3hy,bornDead999,10,Wed Jul 15 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"To add onto /u/audiobydarksock's post:  The most fundamental element in the universe is hydrogen, which (in its simplest and most abundant form) consists of nothing but a single proton with an electron orbiting it.  Every single other element other than hydrogen-1 was formed in a star.  Stars fuse together hydrogen atoms into helium atoms.  When a star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it starts fusing helium atoms together into carbon atoms.  When it runs out of carbon, it starts producing oxygen, neon, silicon, and all sorts of other stuff (this process is known as stellar nucleosynthesis).  The chain ends at iron, which is a unique element in that it has the most binding energy per nucleon of any element, meaning that stars cannot fuse iron atoms together to form heavier elements.  When a star reaches the point that it only has iron atoms to fuse, it generally dies.  ""But /u/paradigmist"", you might say, ""iron isn't the last element in the periodic table.  What about cobalt and nickel and copper and zinc and all those other amazing atoms?  Where did they come from?""  The answer to that question is fucking awesome: supernovas.  Every single atom of every single element heavier than iron was, at some point, created in a fucking awesome supernova when a star many times bigger than the sun collapsed into itself in a gigantic explosion bigger than pretty much any other event that we know of.  Fusing post-iron elements together is not energetically favorable, but supernovas create such huge bursts of energy that they're able to fuse them anyway.  When people start going on and on about how ""we're all starstuff"", they're not wrong.  This entire process answers your question: yes, lighter elements are far more common in the universe, because in the end everything comes from one-proton hydrogen atoms and it takes multiple hydrogens fused together to make anything heavier.  Part of the answer is also because our universe is not particularly near its expiration date; there's still a ton of unfused primordial hydrogen ""fuel"" that has yet to be fused into heavier elements (as /u/audiobydarksock noted, 74% hydrogen and 24% helium)."
chemistry,3dc3hy,Paradigmist,3,Wed Jul 15 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"A few more of the lighter elements were also formed after the big bang (rather than being entirely sourced through stellar fusion) in an event known as primordial nucleosynthesis.

Everything you learn afterwards will build on these principles.  A good solid understanding of the basics will make memorization of mechanisms and reactions unnecessary (to a decent degree at least)."
chemistry,3dazi9,chemicalbob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"I did Organic Chem 1 last year but only did averagely in it (it has a pretty big failure rate in my college though). I asked one of my lecturers how I could improve my grade for Organic 2. She told me that as well as going through notes and learning everything on there (which is what I usually do) - practicing the mechanisms is key. So do questions on mechanisms and ask your tutor or lecturer to look over them for you, and tell you where you're going wrong."
chemistry,3dazi9,adounia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:48 2015 UTC,"Don't let it get in your head. It's doable. Also:  http://www.freelance-teacher.com/videos.htm#ORGANICCHEMISTRY  Maybe try watching a few videos to get a lil bit ahead? I'd say there are certain sections that are harder than others. When you get to the SN1,SN2,E1,E2 stuff, it begins to blur. So try and plan for that and don't get cocky when you find the first few chapters too easy (:  Someone on Reddit also posted this, and it seems pretty great.

chemistry,3dazi9,Malchikiwiki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:50:45 2015 UTC,"I actually did worse in Gen Chem than I did in Organic, so that may be a good sign for you ;)  There is a lot of information to learn in this course. Stay on top of everything. If you feel yourself start to fall behind, try to get extra help (either from TAs or the prof).   Learn all the mechanisms, and not just by memorizing, but by trying to understand how and why the molecules are reacting the way that they are.  If you want to get a head start on something easy that will help you stay ahead for the first little while, (re-) learn or go over the naming and rules for naming of organic functional groups (e.g. alkanes, esters, ethers, alcohols, carboxylic acids and their derivatives...)"
chemistry,3dazi9,HashTagUSuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"like everyone else said, understand why a mechanism is the way it is, after doing this for a while you'll be able to predict mechanisms you've never seen before. do all the problems in your textbook and find some more online. I also advise against a model kit because to me it's a time waster on quizzes and tests so learn to do stereochemistry in your head. Lastly study on a whiteboard with other people and bust out mechanisms. That way if anyone makes a mistake then everyone else can see it and correct you. Just remember that organic is as hard as you want it to be, if you study hard then your grades will reflect that."

chemistry,3d6p7g,FoolishChemist,9,Mon Jul 13 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Best to rinse NaOH (or KOH) residues down the sink - they are harmless enough to not cause any environmental problems.  In fact, when strong alkalis get into the sewers, they tend to saponify built up sewer fat (from cooking grease poured down drains in restaurants), turning it into soap and therefore making it soluble. This then helps to dissolve unreacted fats, which has a clearing effect on sewer lines.  This is precisely the mechanism by which NaOH cleans out drains, which is why it is sold in bulk as an industrial drain cleaner."

Let me clarify something that you may be misunderstanding: there is no such thing as ""an element of 99.999..% purity."" Elements are atoms with an exact number of protons. Sometimes the number of electrons are different (we call those ions), and sometimes the number of neutrons are different (we call those isotopes), but the number of protons in the atom defines the element. This is what is called the elements ""atomic number.""  What is referred to by purity in this context is the concentration of the particular element in your sample. For example, say I have a metal block made up of one million atoms (it's a very small block!) If 900,000 of them are gold atoms, and 100,000 of them are silver atoms, then the block is 90% gold.  Now, let me answer your original question. There is nothing physically impossible about having a chemical sample that is ""100% pure."" That just means all the all the atoms in the sample you are interested in are the same element, with no atoms of different elements mixed in. However, because of a concept you may encounter in the future called entropy (which you can think of as randomness or natural chaos), this becomes extraordinarily rare as your sample of interest contains more and more atoms.  As far as practical benefits of having a sample that is 100% pure vs. 99.999...9% pure, there basically are none in any real-world application of chemistry or physics."

As you said, if you have a passion for science, there are jobs out there you can do without having to do practical chemistry.   There must be someone in your department who will give careers advice etc., have a chat with them and your personal supervisor if you are having doubts about whether chemistry is right for you or not.   Edit: just so you know, I've always been terrible at physics but I generally did quite well in the phys chem modules as it was mostly just learning theory. If you asked me to integrate a rate law or any other undergrad phys chem problem I probably wouldn't be able to do it, but don't give up on phys chem before you've even studied it!"
chemistry,3d3kzh,elnombre91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:15:07 2015 UTC,"The only chemistry I have taken so far is a year of general chemistry.  I have taken two quarters of laboratory courses that I did not find stimulating.  Examples of a couple labs I did are determining the amount of acid neutralized by an antacid tablet and determining the molar mass of an unknown solid.  I enjoyed the electrochemistry lab we did where we measured the voltages of various anodes with both copper and silver being the constant anode.  I enjoyed studying the theory of physical chemistry, mainly aspects about thermodynamics and spectroscopy.  Because the labs are geared toward general chemistry students, I understand that they only allow us to do the basics.  Do labs in organic and physical chemistry become more interesting?  My general experience in completing the 2 labs is that I am a robot following the instructions and aiming to measure/see the desired values.  I really would not want to be a lab technician for a career.  The main reason I am considering jumping off the chemistry ship is to find a more stimulating career available after I graduate.  Do you know career options besides lab technician that I can get with a BS in Chemistry?   There must be someone in your department who will give careers advice etc., have a chat with them and your personal supervisor if you are having doubts about whether chemistry is right for you or not.

In a research group, you will not be doing analysis for the sake of learning analysis, as you do in your freshman lab courses. You will be answering a scientific question, and the techniques are the means to an end. I was never too excited about wet bench techniques either until I joined a group.   So do the experiment on yourself. If you are passionate about science, gun for a research position in which you find the ideas and questions appealing. Make sure you are excited about the research question you will be working on. If you still don't enjoy wet chemistry/biochemistry, try a computational group.   Finally, don't underestimate the ""consulting"" route, where you apply your major and perhaps business classes on the side towards internships in biotech management.

My first job was in a lab attached to an aviation electroplating shop where every day I followed a schedule that had a six week cycle. The work didn't need much more knowledge and skill than I had acquired in high school chem, but from that job I worked my way up to become an engineering technician, and later into management positions in the industry only marginally connected to chemistry/metallurgy which is how I spent the bulk of my working life, and then when I retired, into consulting jobs.  The point I am trying to make is do not look at your education too myopically - where you start, is not likely to be where you end. Furthermore the skills and knowledge you develop doing an undergraduate (or even graduate) degree are not necessary the ones you will use past some entry-level position. The fact is you'll not be any better in a lab than someone who took a two year technician's program, but your potential for advancement will be far greater.

At the beginning a great deal of my time was spent checking compliance for equivalency as part of materials and processes department. OEM manuals would specify one product, and often to reduce cost we would want to use another. To do so both products had to be compared and the paperwork filled out showing that you had determined and was certifying they were the same. As well I wound up doing a lot of MSDS paperwork, as that was the time this system was being introduced. I also worked on environmental tasks, coordinated audits looking for time-expired material, gathered information for trial repair procedures where there was a chemistry/metallurgy component. But mostly I was the interface between the workers on the floor and the engineers, a task I sort of took on voluntarily and that, as it turned out was the key to being offered my first management position.    Is the potential for someone working in a lab to advance far greater than an engineer in a 2 year technician program or vice-versa?   It's been my observation that most lab techs (who often have highly specialized training) stay lab techs unless they become lab managers if the facility they work in is large enough to need one.  Those with a degree generally have greater mobility have career paths that can find them (like in my case) with responsibilities only obliquely related to the actual subject they graduated in."

That's an entire guess though, someone might correct that. Once you've got the PhD then nobody will bat an eye at the undergraduate type. The whole MChem degree really is designed as a stepping stone into PhD programs here. Don't you guys sign up to courses that you can cash out to an MSc or continue to a PhD anyway? If you enter at BS level there then I don't see why it wouldn't.  Vaguely, I don't think it's viewed entirely equivalent to an MSc across Europe, but in the UK it's good enough. That was when I was looking at jobs for that level. I don't think it instantly rules you out though either.   Personally (as an MChem holder): worth it if you're a home student that has the fees covered by student finance. If you're from elsewhere and are stuck having to pay international fees for that extra year then why not just do a full MSc? My main gripe with the MChem is you don't specialise as much as an MSc (and from the monetary perspective you get more time in the lab for your project for an MSc)."
chemistry,3d14zn,Nymthae,2,Sun Jul 12 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"For jobs, it doesn't give much advantage over BSc - a MChem 2:2 is probably worth about the same as a BSc 2:1 unless there's a specific 2:1 cutoff, for example.  For PhDs in the US, a BSc is sufficient.  For the choice of doing any Master's, it's certainly a lot cheaper than doing an MSc, and a UK MSc has about half a year's less credits than US/EU mainland ones, so you should keep that in mind. They are accepted, but not as well as full 2 year Master's. I went the BSc then MSc route and it made getting a PhD much easier because my MSc is in a different subject and my PhD research benefits from both. But if you're a UK student, MSc funding will not exist.  Also, you might decide to stay in the UK - it's probably more likely than you think, laziness is powerful and in the end the GRE is a pain to do when you can just apply like that in the UK. In the US MS/PhD is all one degree usually (you start with the MS and then move onto PhD when you passed that) and UK funding bodies are trying to make the UK system the same, so 80% of PhD positions here will include another Master's. Most of those will also kind of expect you have the MChem or some form of Master's degree going in, so that's something to keep in mind also. It is super likely at this stage that you need the MChem to do MSc (then MPhil) then PhD as a postgrad."

The chemical formula is really just the first page which says how many pieces you'll need.   Actually getting those structures (wood, drug, etc) is a really long and complicated task. Chemists spend whole careers sitting down and working out how they can assemble pieces together to make a drug. Its no trivial task (ie. imagine a super hard lego build without any instructions, you need to work it all out yourself D: )  As for wood, the chemistry that plants and animals perform is utterly crazy, and honestly, we are only really starting to understand very small parts of how they manage to achieve a lot of this.  In very basic terms synthetic chemists aim to make interesting molecules, usually this requires understanding the parts (formula), the shape (structure and stereochemistry) and then use a toolbox (of chemical reactions) to assemble what they are interested in. A lot of the time they are missing a tool and so they have to design a new one (by inventing/discovering a new reaction). Sometimes nature has already done this, and so by studying nature we can reverse-engineer some chemistry!   Hopefully thats sort of helpful!

I don't see why this degree wouldn't be accepted in Canada- but I think it's important to have some research experience so you can show that you know how to think and work on your own, rather than just following a lab manual in a course-based lab. For a low-level lab tech job in Canada, this degree should suffice but having research experience would definitely improve your chances of being employed."

Others - not necessarily so.  Polish degrees are usually perceived as rather detached from professional life and overly theoretical. If you want to overcome this misconception, I would suggest you to start looking for company internships for your summers (e.g. within the framework of Erasmus program) and some lab rotations during the academic year. Effectively, you need to show that you know stuff (as evidenced by your grades) and that you know how to do stuff (evidenced by your experience). For the career in the industry (as opposed to academia), the latter is significantly more important.  To be hired to work in Canada (or any non-EU country), you need to prove to your prospective employer that you are a better hire than a local person. There is bureaucratic overhead and costs involved with hiring a foreigner, so you need to be good... If you don't mind me asking - why Canada? Why not US? Or Singapore? Or somewhere in Europe?  If I had my mind set on Canada, I would most probably move there and decide to do my undergraduate (and graduate) studies there.

It's really not the advisor's job to manage the group's social life, in all the groups I know anything of the advisors don't generally get involved in group get-togethers outside of occasional slightly more formal things like farewell parties for group members and that sort of thing.  To be honest what you describe about your advisor (re: being only interested in your work and not you as a person) is pretty normal.  He's there to be your boss and academic mentor, not your friend/father figure/whatever.   Only having two group meetings a year is a bit weird, I will grant you that.  Perhaps you could organize some sort of more frequent meeting without your advisor, if he doesn't want to do more himself?  Maybe a journal club sort of thing would be appropriate or you could just get together and update each other on your projects.  Also if there's other groups at your school doing related research you could probably ask to sit in on their group meetings and perhaps even be added to the presentation rotation.

If you want the group to be more sociable, it's up to you (especially since you're the senior grad student). Organize outings. Find excuses to wander over to the other office. Hell, bring in a sixpack on Fridays. Invite groups whose offices are close to yours. If they don't respond, then put your head down, grind out your M.Sc. and get the hell out of there. There are lots of good research groups looking for students, and you're not getting much from this one. I feel you, though.

chemistry,3cq6ye,morjax,18,Thu Jul 9 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"Last week I was at a festival. Some guys had a beer bong that was leaky between the tube and the valve, and they just didn't know what to do. I instantly saw the need for parafilm but of course that's not something I take with me camping (why not?!). They just thought I was a helpless girl and dismissed me. Then I realized gaffer tape could be a replacement for parafilm, quickly fixed it up for them and they were just amazed.   Moral of the story: Parafilm has taught me important skills that can be used inside and outside the lab! And I wish I had it everywhere, but sometimes you just have to live with gaffer tape ...."

chemistry,3cq6ye,Anisound,2,Fri Jul 10 06:38:45 2015 UTC,I had a student once who parafilmed his ester sample. Then turned the whole flask over to take the lid of a marker to label it.  All the ester poured out on the floor.  He was so confused. Gave him a little lesson in solubility and then the general idea that it is just fucking stupid to turn any sample bottle upsidedown the way he did even with a lid.

I actually interviewed there at the beginning of my sophomore year but never heard back (which ended up being great since I later got into an amazing research group in my department). Anyways, it's a smallish company that looks for young undergrads to work 10-20 hours per week during the school year and full time in the summer. Some people stay on full time after graduation (my friend opted for a PhD program, however, and was told by schools he visited that industry experience was valuable)."

There are always people being hired somewhere, just as there are people being laid off or retired. I would have hired an appropriate student from a community college anytime, although I admit I was never approached. Having additional experience besides formal education is a huge help."

I've only taken two chemistry classes in college, but I'm currently doing meaningful synthesis, often alone, of fascinating compounds at a sizable biochem company. I got the job because I had some experience doing research, but more importantly because I was referred. Get to know your professors and when it's appropriate, ask them what they know about companies that might be hiring."

chemistry,3cruws,new-comp-chem-guy,2,Fri Jul 10 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"Already started on the optimisation minutes after it was posted!  I'll fill you in.  Even before modelling it, I wasn't sure how well it would turn out with the two carbons that are each bonded to four oxygens.  For the first carbon of the tail, I decided to put the hydrogen down so that the rest of the tail would come up, like a scorpion (it actually looks a lot like a scorpion).  With the groups coming off of the pyridine nitrogens, I wasn't particularly keen on the aromatic notation.  As a phenalene derivative, it's going to need to be a doublet if it's neutral.  That's how it was written, so that's how it's being modelled.  The peroxide eyes greatly prefer to attack the adjacent carbon (next to nitrogen) forming epoxides, so now it really seems like Boc lobsters would have monocular vision.  The mandibles appear beak-like because of the tetrahedral geometry, which is a nice touch.  The tert-butyl groups needed to start with a N-C-O-C dihedral of 180° (not 0°) because of steric hindrance.  I tried to go right for a double-zeta optimisation, but SCF was too far from convergence, so I ended up deciding to do a Gaussian Centipede instead of changing up SCF parameters.  Relaxed the structure by forcing Cs symmetry and doing a PM6 optimisation before eventually doing a triple-zeta PBE optimisation."
