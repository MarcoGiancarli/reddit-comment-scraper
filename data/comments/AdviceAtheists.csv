AdviceAtheists,3dxe6m,ka6emusha,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"While a lot of the ""facts"" in the Horus column have typically been debunked, there are still plenty of stories the bible has stolen from other mythologies. Consider the story of Utnapishtim from the epic of Gilgamesh. He was told to abandon his worldly possesions and build a giant boat by the god Enki in order for his family and other animals to escape a flood. Sounds a bit like Noah's Ark doesn't it? Only, it was written roughly a thousand years before Noah. The Bible is simply an amalgamation of many different stories and mythologies passed down from generation to generation. That is what this image is trying to convey, it is just slightly inaccurate."

AdviceAtheists,3dd94e,dukesinbad,3,Wed Jul 15 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"This is kinda cool, but these aren't exactly comparable.  I mean, rape happens a bunch of times in the Bible.  So?  It's bad when people get raped, don't get me wrong, but why is it bad to talk about it, which is what the Bible does?  Lot's daughters rape him, for example.  This is a huge insult to the Ammonites and Moabites, who resulted from that incestuous rape, because rape is, you know, bad.  Human sacrifice doesn't happen in the Bible.  At all.  Maybe it does in the Christian sequel, I don't know.  I didn't read that one.  But it ain't in the Bible, except in a few bits where it tells you not to pass your children through the fire for the god Molech, and what exactly passing through the fire means is up for debate.  Maybe it's quick.  Maybe it's a brand.  Maybe it's actual child sacrifice.  It's not explained.  The only bit where something like human sacrifice happens is when Abraham takes Isaac to get sacrificed.  But then Isaac doesn't get sacrificed after all, so it doesn't actually happen.  As for animal sacrifice, there's nothing particularly wrong with that unless you're in PETA.  It's a bit weird that God demands animal sacrifices, because that's not something we do today, but it's MUCH more humane than factory farming, and most of the time, those sacrificed animals were sacrificed as food.  As in, dinner for the priests and Levites for the general offerings, and dinner for your family when you brought an offering yourself.  There's nothing particularly outrageous about this.  It's just outmoded by 2000 years or so.  Murder, generally bad.  Don't murder.  I feel like that might be one of the Ten Commandments, actually.  Sounds familiar.  So presumably the Bible would show examples of murdering and how that's bad, which it does.  (If you're talking about stoning people, that's not murder; that's a government-prescribed execution.)  You do have a point when it comes to God killing people.  But calling that murder fails to understand what murder actually is, so I don't know if that ought to count.  As for slavery and misogyny, that's where the problems with the Bible really start.  That stuff actually represents the Bible's authors being shitty people.  If you want an honest look at the terrible teachings of the Bible, you should start with these two and take away most of the other markers.  There's a lot of bad stuff in the Bible, but murder and rape aren't encouraged and sacrifice isn't actually bad.  Slavery and misogyny, though, are actually bad."
AdviceAtheists,3dd94e,xiipaoc,3,Wed Jul 15 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Im super lazy so ill only address your first point.  Rape is bad in the bible because the bible doesnt just talk about it.  It actively commands and encourages it.  If you rape a woman you need only pay some sheckles to her dad and you now own her.  If you take over another town you can keep its virgins for yourself (any and all other people must be killed) but at least its gracious enough to command putting the rape off until she has had time to grieve.  And thats the short list.  Its not just ""and lo was josephina raped"" as a matter of story telling."

Christians refer to a compendium including Old Testament (Tanakh ) books and New Testament books as ""The Bible"".  No other religion, AFAIK, has a ""Bible"".

Read it and try to debunk it for Yourself. Its nothing that needs just a few minutes or hours, provided You try this to do objective. Otherwise You dont even need to read it to ""know"" that its made up.  and btw: he wrote much about his predecessors. The link of this thread points this out.  2nd Edit: spelling"

For example, if I told you I flew to the store today, would you believe me without my proof? Should you be forced to give proof that I never left the ground?  Therefore, you are challenged to prove the truth of the Quran, that it is more than simply a book."

This does not make Muslims Christian or believers in Jesus.  What distinguishes Christians is belief in the divinity of Jesus.  That is what it means to 'believe' in Jesus.  Just the idea that Jesus was a historical figure and a prophet does NOT make a person Christian.  For more clarification, please ask your pastor."
AdviceAtheists,3bq982,thatcantb,0,Wed Jul 1 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Judaism doesn't believe in Jesus as anything relating to god or religion. Therefore, to have a belief in Jesus as relating to a god, by believing him to be a prophet of the Abrahamic God, they have to believe that he existed. Therefore their faith has to have a basis in Christianity.   Furthermore I am an atheist and I don't believe Jesus existed at all in any way that could make him a basis for the biblical Jesus and at best is probably just an amalgamation of a few cult leaders. Most Christians would completely reject the idea that Islam and Christianity are in any way related. Also, I never said that the followers of Islam were Christians, anymore than Christians are automatically Jewish for believing in Moses."

(i.e., a ruling class is right with god; some people are more equal than others)  Alternately, Pastor Mel Kunkle could be saying that since most people realize that equal rights are the correct ideal, maybe this Satan dude was more like MLK or Gandhi and everybody should re-evaluate their relationship with Satan and the good ideals for which he stood.

AdviceAtheists,38qcwk,HaiKarate,9,Sat Jun 6 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"I have to confess that the whole concept of gender reassignment makes me uncomfortable.   Why? I'm a physician and I have treated hundreds of transgender patients for over a decade. This population of patients has a suicidality of about 30-40% untreated. After treatment that goes down to the small single digits. Moreover I have seen patients be able to go off all psych meds and have lifelong depression evaporate after treatment.  I had one patient - a pretty successful professional (mental health field) despite his problems, who had been on psych meds for years. They never resolved his depression, but kept him from being suicidal and did help him function better. He transitioned and it was a rocky couple of years but he did quite well. He confided in me later that when he was transitioning at one point he was worried he was becoming manic - though he was still sleeping OK and wasn't hyper. It took him a while, but he eventually realized that he wasn't manic - the unusual emotion he was feeling all the time was just simple happiness.  So why do you feel uncomfortable? This diminishes suffering, and not infrequently is lifesaving treatment. It's also pretty mainstream now, with the AMA, both APAs, and ACOG all supporting it as medically necessary. Why should you be uncomfortable with people getting this type of health care?  Moreover, why should this not be something that keeps being in the news just like breast cancer, HIV, etc? That 'icky' feeling you get is precisely the same feeling that motivates fundamentalists' hatred. The difference is they revel in it (while it probably makes you uncomfortable) and they use the schizophrenic ramblings of a bunch of bronze-age goat herders to justify their feelings.  That said, as a queer person who cares for a lot of transgender patients, I would much rather see just about anyone in the news improving visibility for the transgender community than a Kardashian. Not all publicity is good publicity, and a Republican fame-whore is not who we need representing us."

It is also widely known as the ""jackass"" penguin for its donkey-like bray, although several related species of South American penguins produce the same sound. Like all extant penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh on average 2.2–3.5 kg (4.9–7.7 lb) and are 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall. It has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask; the body upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band. This pink gland above their eyes helps them to cope with changing temperatures. When the temperature gets hotter, the body of the African penguin sends more blood to these glands to be cooled by the air surrounding it. This then causes the gland to turn a darker shade of pink.     Image i     Interesting: National Aviary | Humboldt penguin | Banded penguin | Inguza   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Because that's not really the point of Shabbat.  The idea behind that, at least in modern interpretation, is that it's to keep Shabbat holy, that is, separate, allowing them to firmly get rid of everyday concerns for a day each week.  I think there are better ways to accomplish this, but it's not altogether crazy.  Crazy is photoshopping out women from pictures of government leaders -- not covering them, but actually making it so that they never even appeared.  Crazy is spitting on and throwing rocks at people who do drive on Shabbat.  Crazy is treating a bastard child as an outcast for ten generations (they actually do this).  Crazy are the contortions they go through to ignore historical evidence regarding the Bible.  Crazy is their adherence to Rabbinical law as unbreakable despite how fucking insane all the regulations are -- crazy is not listening to a woman sing out of concern that it may lead to sin (or whatever their rationale is).  Crazy is putting on a plastic bag when flying over a cemetery because you're a priest.  An unplugged Shabbat is one of the least crazy things done by Jews -- as evidenced by the fact that even relatively liberal Jews do this, and it's generally one of the first steps towards fuller observance if you're into that sort of thing.

AdviceAtheists,36pre4,doombybbr,1 point,Sat May 23 12:33:42 2015 UTC,It basically means you can't go into the temple to pray.
AdviceAtheists,36pre4,elbruce,1 point,Thu May 21 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"It basically means you can't go into the temple to pray.   Who prays at the Temple?  (Actually, Hannah does, but it's so weird that the High Priest thinks that she's drunk.)  The Temple is for sacrificing.  The whole idea of prayer is much newer than the Bible.  The Psalms, for example, are praises, not prayers, and while they were certainly sung at the Temple, the actual reason for singing them was to accompany the sacrifices.  As for the whole ""Congregation of the LORD"" thing (or ""Assembly of God"", which is not what the verse actually says): first off, it's in Deuteronomy 23:2, not 23:1, but 23:1 really belongs to the previous chapter so maybe someone changed it in the version OP read.  Now, who's not allowed in this congregation?  23:2 says people with mutilated genitals.  23:3 says bastards and their descendants to the tenth generation.  23:4-7 says Ammonites and Moabites and their descendants to the tenth generation, with an explanation for why these particular countries are singled out.  It even says that you shouldn't be concerned with their welfare!  Pretty fucked up -- and directly contradicted by the book of Ruth -- Ruth, a Moabite, was shown favor and concern by the Israelites, and she became the great-grandmother of King David himself.  Basically, Ruth was written by people who were pro-immigration, while Deuteronomy and Joshua were written by rabid nativists.  Anyway, 23:8-9 says that Edomites and Egyptians are allowed in the Congregation of the LORD starting in the third generation, and that's all the Bible has to say about that.  Notably absent from this whole passage?  What the fuck the Congregation of the LORD actually is.  Is it just about being ritually unclean, but in a permanent way?  People who are unclean need to leave the camp for the day and bathe before coming back.  It's not a huge deal.  So are they simply not allowed to be Israelites?  Modern Jews actually care about this shit -- the whole thing with Jewish women and religious divorce is because, if they remarry to another Jew without first obtaining a religious divorce, their kids will be bastards.  (Turns out they can just marry a non-Jew and their kids will be Jewish but not bastards.)  But whatever modern-day Charedi Jews think, it doesn't actually say it in the Bible.  So yeah, I have no idea what a Congregation of the LORD is.  (By the way: LORD is capitalized not out of respect but because that's how you generally translate God's name, YHWH, in the Bible.)"
