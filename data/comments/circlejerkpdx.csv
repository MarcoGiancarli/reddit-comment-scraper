Hopefully this will find you well and then we can carry on with our lives by having a productive conversation about the state of Portland—the Rose City, Soccer City USA, and perhaps most famously of all, the seat of Multnomah County. Even when the topic is repetitive, difficult to grasp, or hard to talk about for reasons of socioeconomic justice, political correctness, or matters of the environment it's important to have dialogue.  In addition to these important subjects I feel we must also consider the very nature of /r/Portland/ itself as a venue to discuss such matters. This vibrant community, despite its lack of diversity relative to even the city itself, is a sounding board for contemporaneous issues and anxieties of the region. Most critically it seems that the appropriate format for voicing such concerns is with impenetrable walls of text which are somehow upvoted as if anybody has the time or patience to read that shit when they could be looking at cute pictures of animals, making dank memes, or reading screencaps of greentext stories on 4chan. I suppose when you type on a phone or your tablet there just isn't time to edit so you just keep writing in the hope that any of it will come together but very often it does not.  Like my fellow Portlanders, I am familiar with the iconic carpet at our eponymous airport and am aware of the customary Instagram photo of one's feet ""back at home"" at the gate. For reasons unexplainable, the carpet with this familiar pattern is being changed for carpet of a different and obviously less beloved pattern. Over time, will we come to accept and love it the same way we love the old pattern? It is possible and I have considered it many times even if I don't fly very much but that time has not yet come. Maybe other people think this way but I haven't gotten the sense that anybody else is ready to make that change either.  Well that's just my $.02 on things, or an opinion if you will. Sometimes you wonder what other people think but then you read what they have to say and decide that you'd rather throw yourself from a bridge or in front of a train because if you'd be halfway dead before these people get to the point if they ever do. You know the kind of person I'm talking about they're your Facebook friend you went to school with and you politely added them back but yikes you have to unsubscribe from their updates yesterday because whoa. It's not your fault they have problems and I certainly have my own but I don't share them on social thinking anybody wants to hear them or has the power to solve the problem. It's not ambivalence much less apathy, it's just that we all have personal things to deal with and if you need help some venues are better than others when you go looking for it. I mean if there was a TLDR flair on /r/Portland/ I think you could put it on every self post out there.  Thank you all."

THAT is a huge problem - I have appliances older than I am and faulty wiring in my place, yet they're raising my rent by $200 a year every year to meet the prices of the brand new units coming in down the street. Units that have no set parking, are tiny and offer little in amenities for a big pricetag because people from out of state are willing to pay the rates. They don't even bother to look and see if there's anything cheaper, or better. This pisses off the people who are suddenly paying WAY more than they were just a couple years ago and getting nothing for the increase. So it isn't a sense of entitlement for low-wage workers; it's an issue of fairness, when we're losing so much and not finding any way to get back to where we've been."

A foundational of such an enlightened society is a firm and stable foundation of physiological needs at the base.  To achieve this, the development and perfection of GMO crops has been attained, and continues into perfection.    The stability of a safe, predictable and nutritious food supply maintains the physiological needs at a low economic attainment level, freeing all to pursue higher order social objectives.  The insistence of non-GMO products is a regression to the plan of The Patriarchy (R) (TM) (Patent Pending) (UL) (C) all rights reserved, wherein those malcontents who have yet to find their individual harmony within the all-embracing love of the Patriarchy, and force upon fellow citizens the needless drudgery of a non-GMO commodities production model.    Being forced into such production modalities limits those engaged in non-GMO commodity production from spending their time in pursuits that are harmonious with the will and guidance of The Patriarchy ibid.   Valuable citizens are engaged in the needless and tiring pursuits such as manual weeding, hand picking, and non-mechanical collection of resources when they could be working towards perfecting our economic hegemony worldwide.  Please, please think through your comments before blaming Patriarchy for circumstances that clearly are counter to the benevolent and loving will of The Patriarchy."

He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of money his business associates supposed to balance his from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, (such as real estate management).

circlejerkpdx,2v9xbq,-sgma-,11,Mon Feb 9 06:16:58 2015 UTC,I downvoted you because of your view on fluoridating the springwater corridor.

circlejerkpdx,2v9xbq,Marinaisgo,2,Mon Feb 9 09:02:05 2015 UTC,"It did, but it fell off. Turns out locally sourced vegan organic sticker glue is kind of crappy.   Don't worry, I ran into traffic to retrieve it so it could be recycled."

circlejerkpdx,2v4tcb,hmmokwowthanks,2,Sun Feb 8 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"With spring coming they tend to shed some of their rain jackets and broken shoes in favor of train-crusted carhartts and patches. Being their mating season, they also tend to behave more aggressively if provoked by such actions as ignoring them. To prevent an emergency it is advised to never be seen carrying beer around them as it is necessary for their mating rituals."
