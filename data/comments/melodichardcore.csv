melodichardcore,3dzdhe,CommanderViral,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"This album (really an EP) had so much potential. They built it up as this big full-length and it ended up as a short release with two whole filler tracks of sound. So really, about 23ish minutes of music. Plus none of the tracks are distinguishable from the others. I wanted to like it though."
melodichardcore,3dsyj3,TheLegacy82,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:33 2015 UTC,Pretty pumped for their new album. Cool band from the UK.

I've listened to the album non stop, since Tuesday, and I don't care to listen anything else, because I feel every strain in Brendan's words.   Among a few other bands, if weren't for Counterparts, and Brendan's lyricism, idk if I'd still be here. I relate to no other lyricist, the way I do to Brendan, and the musicianship is just perfect; a mash of hardcore/melodic hardcore, and metalcore in a way that other no other band does it."

But yeah I'm Canadian too but it's crazy for me because I've never got to see them live and I've hardly heard anything bad about the band in general. They seem like nice dudes especially Brendan.

I'm proud to be Canadian and this is one of the reasons why!"

melodichardcore,3cld0x,allaboutandroids,3,Wed Jul 8 23:07:37 2015 UTC,Can't agree more. TDBHAH is one of my favroutie albums ever and I was blown away by this album and think it has the potential to become my favroutie.

melodichardcore,3cld0x,TheWallaby,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the best, but I can't help but say Solace is a better song, gives me goosebumps every time. The way he talks about the person he's writing about hits so close to home, ""I'd Rather die than live without you"". And he brings back the concept from their previous album, ""I think ive finally identified the difference, i think i live in both my hell and my home"" it shows they're maturing.

I've listened a few times through now and I think Resonate is probably my least favorite. I LOVE the end of Burn transitioning into Tragedy, and all of Tragedy. Also really love Collapse into Drown. Awesome stuff. They never disappoint"
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Mankyliam,2,Tue Jul 7 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"That transistion from burn into tradgedy is great. Tragedy may be my favorite song on the CD right now. Gonna have to give it some more listens though. And you're right, they never disappoint. My favorite Canadians."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,PowerRangersFreak,3,Tue Jul 7 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Will Putney is cool and all but I'm not a fan of his work on Northlane's Node (at least the songs that have been released thus far), the guitars sound so muddy and the whole thing is hard to listen to for me. Maybe it was the band's decision to go with that sound idk."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,HateResonates,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"I need to give it a listen. Truth be told, I haven't really listened to them outside hearing a song or two on pandora or iTunes Radio. It could be their idea to go with that sound, I've heard of things like that happening. I mean, the customer is always right. On the other side of that coin, Putney has been hella busy in the last year or so, so that could play into it to. But at the same time  I don't see Northlane putting out something theyre unhappy with."

melodichardcore,3ce65a,Informalmoose3,2,Wed Jul 8 08:42:38 2015 UTC,"He is a producer/mister/maxerer, that means he is responsible for recording the album and pretty much making sound the way it does. Bands can give instructions as to what they want but it all comes down to the producer in the end.    As for the Northlane album, to me it doesn't like a metal/metalcore album at all. This in theory can be good (not sounding like every other album in the genre etc.), but in practice the guitar lost their substance, for example there are a few breakdowns that are not as enjoyable as they would be. Then I noticed the vocals and how diverse they are, but again they don't stand out the way you would expect them. Rot isn't a prime example of what I said, it was recorded long before the rest of the album was composed and the production is more similar to Singularity than anything. My opinion isn't final cause I have yet to listen to the rest of the album"
melodichardcore,3ce65a,xhaveheartx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:22:25 2015 UTC,The band did ask for that sort of sound. They're moving into a much more ambient style and the guitar tones fit with that. It's also much more dynamic when you listen to it loud as hell but you won't really notice this on youtube ect.
melodichardcore,3ce65a,maxxmurda,4,Thu Jul 9 15:21:09 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that doesn't think they can make a record better than TCWCU?
melodichardcore,3ce65a,YoJabroni,5,Tue Jul 7 10:21:28 2015 UTC,"Nope. I said the same thing when TDBHAH came out. Glad I'm actually not alone on this one.  Maybe I just need to listen to this one a little more, but I always find myself falling back on TCWCU  I think most people like the two newer albums more cause Difference was essentially their breakthrough and they're still hyped on that.  Edit: jk just listened to the whole thing a second time. Fucking incredible album. Still enjoy TCWCU more, but this is definitely a step up from TDBHAH"
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Fenix40,3,Tue Jul 7 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"I can respect this. For me, choosing a favorite record is like choosing a favorite child. TCWCU is a classic. If I had a gun to my head, that would probably be my favorite as well. Prophets really got me into them, TCWCU solidified it 100%. TDBHAH is a great album, but will admit it's pretty one note. I feel like they took some influence from other bands a little too much. But this CD, is truly great. If not their best, definitely their second best."

melodichardcore,3ce65a,Fenix40,2,Tue Jul 7 10:36:15 2015 UTC,TCWCU will always bey favorite album. But this is pretty close

It says a lot for their consistency of their music though that it is some people's favorite record.  It just did not click with me at all, and I never find myself listening to it."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Penguino92,2,Tue Jul 7 19:14:04 2015 UTC,Its OK. On first listen there's a few songs that I dug but most of it is just boring to me unfortunately(and this coming from someone with a counterparts tattoo). I think I would of liked this more if this is what they had put out after TCWCUA instead of TDBHAH. I'll have to listen again with headphones but I don't think it'll change my mind much.
melodichardcore,3ce65a,uberhaxorowen,2,Wed Jul 8 05:55:08 2015 UTC,"I pretty much felt the same way as you on my first listen, but after going back to it I'm digging it so much. Give it some time, it may grow on you."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,ImAnEagle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:03:38 2015 UTC,I've probably given it a good 10 or so spins now and I'm still honestly not digging it too much. There are a few songs I enjoy but a lot of the riffs are just recycled from other songs. It has its moments but probably not something I'm going to revisit to much. Which sucks because Counterparts used to be one of my favorite bands now they just don't do much for me.
melodichardcore,3ce65a,normcollison,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:12:52 2015 UTC,Where did you listen to it
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Maximus77x,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:23:28 2015 UTC,Buddy sent me a download link. It leaked apparently.
melodichardcore,3ce65a,choochoochrain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Dude, I totally agree with you! I've been listening to it nonstop. No other album has caught my attention like this one has."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Mankyliam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"I'm with you dude, 100% a heavy contender for the album of the year! These guys are my favourite (Active) band and I love everything they put out. I think they get better with each album I know a lot of people will pic TCWCU over TDBHAH but I think it was a step in an amazing direction. I have this album pre ordered and I'm stoked for them"
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Informalmoose3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"One thing that came to mind when I was listening to it in full for the first time was that it sounds like all of their old stuff combined, but at the same time it sounds like something completely new to Counterparts, and the genre as a whole. Really digging the handful of spoken word parts of the album."
melodichardcore,3ce65a,Mankyliam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"This is (in my eyes) AOTY hands down, we've had so many amazing cd's in every genre come out this year but Counterparts just claimed the medal. I am so in love with this cd, the music, the lyrics the vocals, everything is just top notch, I really love the breakdown at the end of stranger, with those lyrics and the fact that it gets slower gives me chills, and solace is just the perfect way to end this masterpiece, the guitar work is beautiful."
melodichardcore,3c9mov,BaconNutellaSandwich,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"Dammmmmnnnnn They sound like a mix between Defeater and Underoath, and I fucking love it."
melodichardcore,3c9mov,FinalVersus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah when I first heard these guys Defeater was the first thing that came to mind as well. Not so much Underoath, but I can definitely see it."

melodichardcore,3c9mov,the_mixmaster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:36:12 2015 UTC,No problemo! Thanks for listening! Oh yeah for sure the part with the blast beats at 2:30 has a major Black Metal vibe.
melodichardcore,3c9mov,the_mixmaster,2,Mon Jul 6 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"RIP Manners. I knew a few of the guys in the band, they're from my hometown. Glad that they 'made it' from our local scene"
melodichardcore,3c9mov,ShawWow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"Ah man I didn't know they were done for, that's quite a bummer. I loved Escapism and Apparition, but Pale Blue Light was my favorite release of last year. It was such a dark unique album with a wide array of influences and the song writing was top notch.  They really were something special."
melodichardcore,3c7iix,MikeyMac88,11,Sun Jul 5 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"for constructive criticism's sake; you lose almost all credibility going into a review if you say ""i checked out their debut album once and haven't listened to the second one"". While a first impression is valuable, i generally don't want to keep listening to your review if you're going into it blindly, not being able to compare their previous effort from the album you are reviewing seriously detracts from the review. thanks for sharing though."
melodichardcore,3c7iix,HXCpolarbear,3,Sun Jul 5 17:28:49 2015 UTC,Agreed here - why would I relate to your review if you have such a different taste in music than myself (i.e. BAAO)?
melodichardcore,3c7iix,PM_ME_MY_NUDES_PLZ,2,Sun Jul 5 18:32:33 2015 UTC,I totally understand what you're saying.  I guess the purpose of the review is to showcase my opinion of the record and (in this case specifically) there isn't always going to be a personal history with the band. But I get that without any comparison to older work from BAAO there's a lot of potential discussion lost.   Next time a situation like this occurs I'm going to make sure to have a better sense of previous releases from a band. I appreciate the help!
melodichardcore,3c7iix,the_mixmaster,2,Sun Jul 5 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"Finally someone who reviews metalcore albums. Perhaps a track by track discussion or discussing some tracks you liked? You should review Hundredth's new album, keep up the good work"
melodichardcore,3c0ect,scottheisel,4,Fri Jul 3 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Man, why don't you see security guys enjoying themselves more often? I realize Hardcore is not for everyone, but at least some of these guys must've thought ""Awesome, free concerts!"" before they took the job."

melodichardcore,3c2tt9,Galerider,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:00:22 2015 UTC,"New hardcore song that I wrote/played/produced in my basement, which is the sonic equivalent of my unbleached anus. Galerider is my solo project, which I am planning to develop into a gigging band soon. Thought I might as well post it here, cause posting stuff on the internet is a surefire way to generate nothing but glowing reviews and positive criticism. I can imagine this being somewhat appealing to fans of bands like For the Fallen Dreams, Stick To Your Guns, Counterparts and Your Demise. Ily."

melodichardcore,3bn6ec,natejs,2,Tue Jun 30 15:51:49 2015 UTC,this isn't a new album. its a remaster of their EP before they got signed to a label.

melodichardcore,3bakjv,seventhousandmiles,-7,Sat Jun 27 10:31:55 2015 UTC,"Oh wow another Christianity bashing song that shoves something in their face, how original yawn. Either celebrate the ruling or recognize that homophobia isn't limited to one religion."
melodichardcore,3bakjv,-warheadsonforeheads,-6,Sun Jun 28 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, love this song, but the song talks about the religious (Christians in particular) persecuting gays. The Supreme Court ruling found gay marriage to be Constitutional. There's obviously an association here, but calling this song celebratory really pulls away from both the song and the ruling to me."
melodichardcore,3bavo1,CautionCurb,0,Sat Jun 27 13:26:57 2015 UTC,I find screamed vocals along with an acoustic guitar cringe inducing. I can see how its emotionally raw but it just sounds bad to me.

I think I recognize some of the areas in the video.  Used to live there when Shores was still together.  I had some friends in Thomas Helvenstine's old band Shores.  Small world man!
melodichardcore,3b3r9w,Shihska,6,Thu Jun 25 18:53:03 2015 UTC,"After listening to the album through four times, I have to say that this album is my favorite BAAO to date, and I think it's their best release. They took the tone from HWBWP and went further in to the sound but made it way better, as HWBWP was actually my least favorite album they did.  The best three tracks are   Judas, Our Brother Forgetting Is Forgiving The I Sleeping Sicarii/Ain't Nobody Perfect (<-- couldn't decide)   This album is BAAO at their prime sound, this is what this band is meant to sound like. They've really matured and found their way to this sound, and I love the direction that they went with it."
melodichardcore,3b3r9w,Morphang,2,Fri Jun 26 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely enjoyed this album! it has some solid tracks on it. i love st. peter, sleeping sicarii, and sins of the father.   the only complaint i have is that its a little too religious/christian for my taste. i know Joels a pretty big christian but what drew me to them is how religious ideas were put into their songs, but as abstract thoughts. this album is a little too preachy for me.  but i do really enjoy the overall sound of it. like others have stated, they have definitely matured their sound since the first album."
melodichardcore,3b3r9w,bennybunny25,2,Fri Jun 26 14:09:23 2015 UTC,"It's good, though I'm sort of too caught up in the new ABR hype to pay a huge amount of attention to this one"

melodichardcore,3b3r9w,gnc_fb,5,Thu Jun 25 21:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after Dear God, the drummer and rhythm guitarist left and they brought on some new people and basically changed the entire band chemistry and genre. I freaking love  Dear God, and I don't mean to hate on BAAO but they sorta fell off imo."
melodichardcore,3b3r9w,HeyGuysImMichael,2,Thu Jun 25 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"Dear G-d felt was much more melodic. I like Mikey McGough's vocals but I think he's brought more a ""gloom metal"" vibe to the band. But I loved The Elijah though so I have no reason to complain ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

I enjoyed the song, there's a lot of mediocrity in music and it's nice to hear bands that know their stuff. These songs could easily be blended into one and I hope you're incorporating that into your live performances. The guitars have good tone and the vocal quality is definitely above average. (At least for bands where I'm from.) The bass could use a light touch of distortion to boost it. The bass tends to get lost very often in the mix and I can hardly tell it's there.  The drums are on point and I can feel the attack. I hope to hear more from you guys in the future. If there's a facebook page of you band, you should drop a link. I would love to show my support and keep up to date with you guys."

melodichardcore,3ab7wr,shredler,2,Fri Jun 19 17:29:24 2015 UTC,Expire is the best band to lift to imo
melodichardcore,3ab7wr,blondecloudyhaze,3,Sun Jun 21 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"I'd check out Napoleon, Climates, While She Sleeps newest album brainwash and Blood Youth. While she sleeps is the only one of those bands that has multiple albums. Napoleon, Climates and Blood Youth all only have singles and EPs. Actor/observer is great as well."
melodichardcore,3ab7wr,itsableeder,3,Thu Jun 18 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"If you like Napoleon, check out Dead Harts and Polar as well. They're all bands that came up at the same time and played together a lot, and they have a similar sound. Dead Harts and Polar have more releases than Napoleon too."
melodichardcore,3ab7wr,blondecloudyhaze,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:06:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions. I was just thinking yesterday I wish I could find more bands similar to Napoleon. Between how good the music is and great the production is there's a lot to love.
melodichardcore,3ab7wr,itsableeder,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:49 2015 UTC,No worries at all. I've gigged with all of those bands a few times over the last 3 or 4 years and they're all great. It's nice to see them getting some love out in the wild.

melodichardcore,39qzr6,ironicirenic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Also, look for inspiration other places too.   This would be my suggestion too. I'm not very experienced in writing music (not at all actually), but if you're going into writing with the mindset that the music has to have a certain sound, then you're just unnecessarily limiting yourself. Also, if you're only taking inspiration from 3-4 bands, the music can easily come off as very derivative."

melodichardcore,39gys4,DeadBlessings,3,Thu Jun 11 17:26:26 2015 UTC,They started streaming it today and i am in love
melodichardcore,399vnq,liamb-,-1,Wed Jun 10 08:23:02 2015 UTC,I got about 10 seconds in. No thanks.
melodichardcore,399vnq,andrewsmd87,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:06:59 2015 UTC,not a problem.
melodichardcore,395ihk,buymedinnerfirst,14,Tue Jun 9 12:02:36 2015 UTC,Lyrically one of my favourite songs Brendan has written but the music isn't as strong as it has been in the past.   Still an excellent track.
melodichardcore,395ihk,HateResonates,4,Tue Jun 9 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I LOVE Counterparts. Even got their logo tattooed on my arm.   But the two songs so far are a LOT simpler and not as fleshed out as The Current & The Difference. Though the mid-section of this song is more like the past, it's hard to explain, but it's just not as strong and innovative as the past. Really hope the departure of Alex Re doesn't hinder the strength of the LP. Hopefully they still have some bangers hidden away."
melodichardcore,395ihk,Informalmoose3,9,Tue Jun 9 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"Simpler doesn't necessarily mean not as good, I personally think this is on par with all their older stuff."
melodichardcore,395ihk,normcollison,2,Tue Jun 9 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, I fucking love the two songs for what they are. The instrumentals work perfectly with the lyrics, it's just a powerful song."
melodichardcore,395ihk,ShrubsLI,8,Tue Jun 9 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you and /u/HateResonates, especially with the ""not as fleshed out comment."" If you haven't already, put on your headphones and really listen to it a few times.   The song clocks in at only 2:38, but it feels twice as long. All the tempo changes; enough parts and changes for an entire album's worth of music from a lesser band; the various textures of Brendan's voice, from the raw stuff to the cleans to the little bit of spoken word; the absolutely ridiculous drum work.  Maybe the guitar parts are a little understated compared to the stuff on Difference, but overall, the work on this stuff is beautiful and textured (I hate to keep coming back to that word, but it feels like the perfect word to describe the thought and musicianship that went into this song). My favorite moments guitar-wise are subtle ones--:31-:33 and :49-:51. It's stuff like that that puts Counterparts so far ahead of any other band in the genre right now.  And then the intangibles--the raw emotion of this music is just amazing.  Based on this song and ""Burn,"" I really think we're looking at an album that's going to set a new standard for the genre. That's a cliche that gets thrown around a lot, but I think it's true in this case."
melodichardcore,395ihk,jack_fucking_gladney,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm not at all worried about this album, it's going to be excellent."
melodichardcore,395ihk,HateResonates,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:52:19 2015 UTC,Don't forget Eric isn't on this album either.
melodichardcore,395ihk,TheReflexTester,3,Wed Jun 10 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"True, but they've said multiple times that Jesse pretty much writes all of the music and Brendan writes all of the lyrics so I don't think they're departures will make much of a difference."
melodichardcore,395ihk,robargarthan,0,Wed Jun 10 06:43:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who has heard the entire record, trust me. It's all like this. Good, but nothing like before. While I don't think simpler songs = worse songs, in this case their songs just aren't as good as they used to be, IMO. Hate to say it, I really do."
melodichardcore,395ihk,TryingToHaveGoodMood,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Well that's saddening. No doubt that I'll love the album, but I guess TCWCU will always be my favorite then."
melodichardcore,395ihk,Informalmoose3,0,Wed Jun 10 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be a bummer, but in my opinion it's just really not nearly as good as their last two records. They're obviously hard to top, but still. Let down for me at least"
melodichardcore,395ihk,TryingToHaveGoodMood,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well I know I won't be let down as they're one of my favorites ever, but I was hoping to hear something that could top The Current."

melodichardcore,395ihk,normcollison,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:56:19 2015 UTC,Not imo. That's everyone's favorite because that was their breakthrough and usually the first LP that someone would hear from them.   I've been a fan since Prophets was released and The Current is without a doubt their best album to me.
melodichardcore,395ihk,Informalmoose3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"As have I, but I respect your opinion"
melodichardcore,395ihk,normcollison,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:14:49 2015 UTC,"As someone who's in the same position and can't find a single thing to dislike about any of their previous releases, I believe this album is going to rule."
melodichardcore,395ihk,Maximus77x,0,Wed Jun 17 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a little disappointed, but I was also kind of expecting this. It seems like the music has been getting more simple since people started leaving.   Some of Ryan's drum parts were insane (there used to be a drum cam of Digression on YT, dunno if it's still there but it was really impressive), and I loved those. I still think the new album will be incredible and I love both of the songs they've put out, but it would be 10x better with that same complexity.  Just IMO, obviously."
melodichardcore,395ihk,Tothoro,2,Tue Jun 16 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"Kelly's drums sound way crazier to me. More stripped down and to the point, sure. But technically and musically they are far more stimulating. The majority of the snare hits on Hell and Home are ghost notes and off beats, tons of time changes, etc etc. Ryan just hit the drums more/crazier. (Not that he wasn't also phenomenal. I just think Kelly is on another level, theory wise.)"
melodichardcore,395ihk,asleeplessmalice,0,Wed Jun 17 11:28:30 2015 UTC,"True. I wasn't trying to say Kelly was bad and maybe simple was the wrong word. Less aggressive might be more appropriate, but I originally said simple because I play drums and Ryan's parts are much more difficult for me to play than Kelly's.  Kelly and Ryan are both great drummers, I just prefer Ryan's style over Kelly's."
melodichardcore,395ihk,Tothoro,9,Wed Jun 17 13:10:30 2015 UTC,This album is gonna be straight fire.
melodichardcore,395ihk,xxLEGIT360NOSCOPESxx,10,Tue Jun 9 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"This album is going to be the soundtrack of my year, just like every album by counterparts before it."
melodichardcore,395ihk,-Shadlez-,9,Tue Jun 9 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"it's pretty damn neat, altough I think Burn is even better"
melodichardcore,395ihk,zsombro,4,Tue Jun 9 13:29:20 2015 UTC,Man I'm glad I checked this sub today.
melodichardcore,395ihk,bucketshazz2,4,Tue Jun 9 13:02:23 2015 UTC,Their best song yet. Honestly. Best song and I'm a fan of all their stuff.
melodichardcore,395ihk,hadjicfc,2,Tue Jun 9 13:06:50 2015 UTC,"Meh, while I wouldn't say I dislike any of Counterparts' stuff, none of it really sticks out to me either, and this is no different. Maybe it's because I tend to like bands that are a bit more experimental, but I haven't seen much progression from them between The Difference Between Hell and Home and the new songs, and that sort of keeps me from getting into them."
melodichardcore,395ihk,DeadBlessings,3,Tue Jun 9 18:31:02 2015 UTC,Try Soil  Make sure to read through the lyrics along with it. This is probably my favorite song by them and is definitely on the more experimental side of their music.
melodichardcore,395ihk,surgeon314,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it, definitely one of their better songs, I just feel like bands like Hundredth and Defeater are doing a better job at the sound they have."
melodichardcore,395ihk,DeadBlessings,2,Wed Jun 10 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah to each his own then! Because I have exactly the same problem with Defeater. I just can't get into them, none of it interests me. Hundredth is rad though."
melodichardcore,395ihk,surgeon314,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting, in my opinion Defeater is pretty much the best band in the genre (as you can probably tell from my flair)"

I really saw it with TDBHAH, and from what I've seen so far its happening with this album.  Then again im not really a fan of everything on TCWCU  The songs may sound simpler, but they certainly are just as strong as everything that came before them, no doubts this album is going to be top of the list for me."
melodichardcore,3958if,sheldonhuk,5,Tue Jun 9 10:08:56 2015 UTC,Lyrics are kinda cheese but the everything else is super tight.

melodichardcore,391uqx,FuckedUpMaggot,4,Tue Jun 9 00:29:45 2015 UTC,I really love STYG but I found myself bored of their new album really quickly
melodichardcore,391uqx,I_Nut_In_Butts,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:57:55 2015 UTC,How so?
melodichardcore,391uqx,lAbstractedl,2,Tue Jun 9 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"A few reasons. It wasn't as long as I was hoping, there was a lot more singing than I had expected (not that I dont like Jesse's cleans, quite a few of the songs felt like fillers, I wish the instrumentation was a bit better/faster, etc.   Just little things like that kept me from listening as much as I thought I would. Don't get me wrong, there are some gems on this album, just not as many as Diamond had."
melodichardcore,391uqx,I_Nut_In_Butts,2,Tue Jun 9 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I'm feeling the same about the new Northlane tracks they've put out for their upcoming release. For that situation though, I don't feel like it's the same Northlane. Too different than their previous stuff.   With this latest album from STYG, I still feel like they're still STYG, but a different version if that makes sense. I understand that bands grow and evolve, sometimes in ways that everyone loves, sometimes in ways that everyone hates, and the levels in between. I like Disobedient a lot, but understand where a lot of fans are put off by it when comparing it to Diamond, and especially earlier stuff like The Hope Division. Maybe this was just a change of pace, and their next project will radiate old school STYG."
melodichardcore,391uqx,lAbstractedl,2,Tue Jun 9 18:16:52 2015 UTC,The new Northlane has been hit and miss for me.  I really enjoyed Rot. I think thats a really good song. Ra and Obelisk are just boring though.
melodichardcore,391uqx,I_Nut_In_Butts,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that Rot is my favorite of the three so far. I just feel like Marcus isn't bringing that same gritty, heaviness that Adrian was able to create with his vocals. They were so well suited for the style that Northlane projects. It just sounds like a different band to me."

melodichardcore,38sw0l,yourmindsdecide,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:10:44 2015 UTC,The band themselves said in an interview that they don't like being pigeonholed into a genre. That probs why on facebook they have listed for genre: decide for yourself.

They started out as a hardcore band like this -- I believe all of their older material is collected on the Barely Legal / All Ages compilation set of their older stuff.

Went to The Story So Far show with her the other day and she left saying ""Terror was amazing!"". Honestly she never would have given a band like Terror a chance if it wasn't for them opening for TSSF. Now she is asking me for hardcore bands to listen to. I don't think I could have gotten her to like hardcore but seeing a band really kill it live got her to. I'm hoping that when we go to this show she approaches it with an open mind (she already wants to see Counterparts) but I'm hoping ETID blows her mind. Realistically I hope everyone goes to shows like these with open minds. I love that the scene is trying to come together and I can't stand elitists that wanna pull it apart.

Where's the ""melody""?   You guys can downvote me now, I'll go yell at some clouds ;)"

They're more towards the post-hc/metalcore genre.  My favorite Melodic hardcore bands are:  Touché Amoré  Killing the Dream  Dead Swans  Verse  More Than Life  These bands is the way into melodic hardcore, whenever someone asks me where to start, this is it.  Hope this helps, I read an article ~6 months ago about the history of melodic hardcore but I couldn't find it, someone else here might have it though. Stay trve!"

Although the bonus track 'Every Second' is pretty generic Hardcore. I feel that their previous albums fit the bill of Melodic Hardcore perfectly, although I'm not a fan of the 'Melodic' part of it all. I guess when I think of Melodic Metalcore I think more along the lines of In Flames and Soilwork, but I do get where you're coming from."

Have Heart (Songs to Scream at the Sun omg) even early The Ghost Inside the first For The Fallen Dreams album is awesome no matter how much I hate them now Sinking Ships is a little later down the road, but still classic"

But yea, Verse, Comeback Kid and Have Heart might be bands you want to listen to.  STYG and TGI, yea they are, but with a more mordern influence. TGI has more metalcore elements, where as STYG has more hardcore elements, imo."

melodichardcore,35komd,Hitler_the_stripper,2,Tue May 12 10:26:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't even think of this! There are numerous stories of people saying that their vocalist frequently gets girls drunk (underage girls too) at their shows to take advantage of them sexually. He hasn't communicated with the band for a while now (since before the split).  One of the commenters asked whether the band feels accountable for Charlie's actions since they knew about his habits and still let him go ahead with this stuff, to which they replied this:  ""Your comment is fair. We always knew Charlie was promiscuous but I can assure you that privacy on tour 100% does exist if you find it, which he very often did, so stuff was able to go on behind closed doors. You could also hold accountable any band we've toured with if you think that everything happens out in the open. This isn't actually the sole reason we broke up, because we learned of an incident involving an underage girl about 4/5 weeks after we split and facts started coming out the woodwork. You can frown all you want at sleeping around but a lot of people do it and it's part of the music industry, we had words multiple times with Char about his behaviour particularly whilst drunk and been met with a defensive god complex. More and more bands we toured with were getting sick of his attitude and behaviour because he seemed to care more about sex than anything half the time, but not basing it on underage stuff as it wasn't something he seeked, but something he wasn't nearly careful enough about. You can kinda understand the variation of what went on within this band when you learn that half of us had girlfriend's during this whole time and I've (Ed) personally never slept with a girl on tour, not even once."""
melodichardcore,35komd,Janaar,3,Tue May 12 10:40:21 2015 UTC,"no need to apologize, it just is what it is.  Thank you for writing it out, I really love everything this band has put out and it is upsetting to find that A) they aren't a band anymore and B) the vocalist would do some shit like this.  I'm not edge but this is why alcohol is a terrible thing.  I enjoy drinking but it really can and does kill people, their reputation, their careers and hurt people around them.  Sexual addiction is just as bad.  Again, thanks for writing out the post for me to see.  It's going to be hard to listen to their music in the future, despite how good it is."
melodichardcore,35komd,moshlyfe,3,Tue May 12 11:11:12 2015 UTC,"What the fuck. I didnt even know they split, fucking facebook.   Anyway, Id like to hear charlies side of the story first, before I make my mind up."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,yoaxeen,10,Mon May 11 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"Along those same veins, I think a lot of it also has to do with the kind of music one grew up listening to as well. As someone who spent a number of years listening to metalcore before branching out as an older teen, my progression went from nu-metal (Linkin Park, Slipknot, etc.) to metalcore (BFMV, Trivium at the time, etc.) before I ultimately started branching out into death, melo-death, prog metal (when I joined a band), and then hardcore because of the local bands we played with which ultimately turned into a love of melodic-hardcore.  In that sense, metalcore is definitely much more audience friendly, I guess (?), as far as the fact goes that it's accessible coming from nu-metal/screamo. It's also the most scene-driven subgenre of metal, which helps when that all gets peddled in Hot Topics and whatnot (actually the reason my sister started listening to my music, to be in a ""scene"").  As for melo-hxc itself, due to the fact that a lot of lyricism tends to typically deal with tougher topics of emotion and trauma, it's a little less accessible to wider audiences methinks. Similar to the metalcore progression thing, I know that a lot of my love for melo-hxc came out of growing up listening to emo, pop punk, and screamo, and melo-hxc kind of completed that harder sound with a similar feel.  But honestly, that's just me. Different strokes for different folks, aha."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,MetalGojira,19,Mon May 11 05:52:50 2015 UTC,"It's something you really have to compare on multiple levels. First off, and probably most common, screaming. Most people say it gives them head aches.   Melodic hardcore is also a more serious genre, with themes like depression and being oppressed. This also alienates people. While most have been sad before, they might not connect to the depressed feeling that the song pushes. I'd also say that the majority of people listen to music for happy feelings, or for fun.  So why do people listen to metalcore more often? Metalcore is a lot less serious, for one, and it also has a lot of hype moments as well. While melodic hardcore also has break downs occasionally, they're usually not as exciting on a surface level. It's comparable to a bass drop in dubstep, if you understand what I'm getting at.  I hope I helped out!"
melodichardcore,35kbpm,alukard15,3,Mon May 11 05:36:39 2015 UTC,I hope you're getting upvoted for the first paragrah because I honestly don't see any sense in the other ones.
melodichardcore,35kbpm,edubkn,5,Mon May 11 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"Melodic hardcore is also a more serious genre, with themes like depression and being oppressed. This also alienates people.   This is pretty ridiculous. Some of the biggest songs of all time are about depression, you can't honestly be using this as a reason for why melodic hardcore is underground.   Metalcore is a lot less serious   Also ridiculous. No genre is more 'serious' than another, even some pop music has very serious political undertones.   While melodic hardcore also has break downs occasionally, they're usually not as exciting on a surface level.   '...on a surface level'? Come on man now you're just making shit up. Some of the best breakdowns I've ever heard have been in melodic hardcore bands. Check out Reach Beyond the Sun by Shai Hulud."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,Counterfarts,-1,Mon May 11 21:41:06 2015 UTC,"Hey I didn't mean to upset anybody with this. Yes, any genre can have serious songs. But are you going to see Being as an Ocean put out a song about truffle butter anytime soon? Probably not."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,alukard15,5,Mon May 11 22:32:41 2015 UTC,But are you going to see Being as an Ocean put out a song about truffle butter anytime soon? Probably not.   TIL Metalcore bands make songs about truffle butter.
melodichardcore,35kbpm,Counterfarts,1 point,Mon May 11 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"You've sparked an interesting debate, and I don't think either of you are wrong per se. I guess it's a subjective thing. For me the genre is certainly depressing but in a bittersweet, ethereal sort of way that I don't always get when listening to metalcore."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,AsGoodAsDeader,2,Wed May 13 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it isn't really a genre.  It's just kind of a description of a sound.  Who even fits this genre?  Counterparts and The Ghost Inside?   /r/metalcore endlessly argues the ghost inside isn't metalcore which I personally think is ridiculous.  Especially after seeing them a few weeks back, to me that is the epitome of metalcore.  Saw Counterparts too.  It's a punk band.  With some breakdowns.  I feel like the label melodic hardcore is being forced on a handful of bands but it isnt really a thing.  Like when people argued 'djent' was a sound not a genre... then djent blew up.... and.. I dont really have a point.  I would challenge anyone who isn't  adamantly pushing this genre or label to name five melodic hardcore bands."
melodichardcore,35kbpm,Maximus77x,2,Thu May 14 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"You really think so? Here's a bunch:  Counterparts Means For the Fallen Dreams (old) It Prevails The Ghost Inside Shai Hulud Capsize Shai Hulud Heart in Hand Defeater Landscapes Saints Never Surrender Being As An Ocean My Iron Lung Worthwhile Napoleon Have Heart (more traditional hardcore -- bridging the gap) Sinking Ships (same as above -- bridging the gap)  Granted, you could argue a few of these are closer to just ""hardcore"", but that's why sub genres exist in the first place. I mean, melodic hardcore has been a ""thing"" since 2000 or before lol."

And you could categorize them as post-hardcore, I just think they're awesome bands and their style fits in with the melodic hardcore bands I like. As for similar bands to BAAO that's a tough one they're pretty unique. You could try capsize although they don't have too many clean vocals. I'll dig through my old spotify playlists to see if I find anything else. There's one band who went form hardcore to almost identical to BAAO I just can't put my finger on their name."

melodichardcore,35ccwn,jimhatesyou,1 point,Sat May 9 11:35:33 2015 UTC,This is so bad ass. I found a few other instrumentals off this site including Key To The World by Four Letter Lie which was a local band for me and I loved that album. Finding that from a band that's not that big is awesome.   There's Ohio Is For Lovers instrumental available on that site too. Just google:  instrumental site:anothervictory.com

I love when you find bands at the right time in your life. I hope they can make it to the US some day."
melodichardcore,35aipm,superblah,1 point,Fri May 8 16:39:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. They just got me with the song Hell and then everything just falls together. Looking forward to hear more from them.

melodichardcore,357kwb,DeadBlessings,1 point,Fri May 8 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"At first, I thought there was no way that the Warped lineup could be as good as last year and until the last few lineup announcements that still held through, but now it looks like its going to be just as good. blessthefall, August Burns Red, Pierce the Veil, Fit For A King, Being As An Ocean, '68, and Sirens & Sailors make for a pretty solid lineup."
melodichardcore,357kwb,DavidR525,2,Fri May 8 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"There weren't many bands I liked last year, so I was especially excited about this year. August Burns Red, '68, Miss May I, Fit For a King, We Came As Romans, Hundredth, Being as an Ocean, Blessthefall, Beartooth, and Silverstein are the ones I'm really looking forward to."
melodichardcore,357kwb,DeadBlessings,2,Fri May 8 00:39:28 2015 UTC,No they just posted the same link with The Wake on it.

melodichardcore,357kwb,stijnkloos,2,Thu May 7 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"I actually thought the opposite, the last two albums, especially the first, were ""top tier"" to me, however this song did not move me emotionally. To me it sounds like any other band could have written it, while the first two albums bear a very distinct sound"

melodichardcore,357kwb,asleeplessmalice,-2,Fri May 8 01:54:21 2015 UTC,I liked their change in style. I just hope they drop the whole try -hard pretentious overly artsy title thing

melodichardcore,355zze,keenankoso,5,Thu May 7 15:44:55 2015 UTC,That's kinda shitty of them. I don't use Twitter. Why can't I post it on my Myspace page?
melodichardcore,355zze,SchrodingersMatt,5,Thu May 7 14:42:30 2015 UTC,Idk how I feel about it... I feel like it needs to be remastered differently; more like their previous album. His vocals sound like their myspace releases (unmastered).
melodichardcore,355zze,magnamighty,1 point,Thu May 7 15:55:32 2015 UTC,Im sure they'll make it as good as the last album was.
melodichardcore,355zze,ohshitishitmyself,5,Thu May 7 18:39:02 2015 UTC,I know I will catch shit for this but I havent liked any of their music since Dear G-D. Which is kind of sad because I LOVED that album. I just dont like the direction they are headed I guess. The hardcore scene is already full of what they are trying to become.

melodichardcore,357v9v,YourphobiaMyfetish,4,Thu May 7 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"Some definitely will find them boring and uninventive, but for me they are one of the best bands around. The Angst In My Veins was my second favorite album last year but it took a couple listens for it to truly click. The whole album just feels really dark and the lyrics hit home for me. They're older stuff is just as good, but I can see them having to be an acquired taste for some."
melodichardcore,357v9v,Discovering_Oceans,1 point,Thu May 7 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"I love the genre, I've been listening for years so I don't think acquiring a taste for a band will be a thing for me. They just don't sound different from most other melodic-hardcore bands to me for some reason."
melodichardcore,357v9v,yourmindsdecide,1 point,Fri May 8 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"This is because they don't. They're doing very standard Melodic Hardcore, it's just that many people can relate to the lyrics. If that doesn't click for you, there are many bands with a similar style that may be more for you."
melodichardcore,357v9v,Informalmoose3,2,Fri May 8 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's really easy to find music nowadays. Just go on Spotify and listen to their full-length.  IMO, their full-length was one of my favorite albums last year"
melodichardcore,357v9v,Brianlarcom,1 point,Thu May 7 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm listening to them now on youtube."
melodichardcore,357v9v,Brianlarcom,1 point,Fri May 8 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"I'm really torn on this band, some of their songs I think are really good. But half of their album just blended together and sounded the same and didn't do much for me, I still thought it was okay tho. The live performance is what ruins it for me, the instruments kill it but the vocals were just so bad"
melodichardcore,357v9v,bloodlusting,1 point,Thu May 14 03:27:02 2015 UTC,That's disappointing. It seems like a live performance can either make or break a band sometimes.

melodichardcore,350i93,uberhaxorowen,11,Wed May 6 02:15:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know of there's really a huge tier gap in melodic hardcore compared to most genres. Its a niche genre on its own so people end up exposed to either all or none of it. That means there's really not a central leading artist that influences the others more. I think they kind of all develop and evolve together because of that. Of course, some names still stand out... Just not as prominently as leaders of most other genres would."
melodichardcore,350i93,PaidToSpillMyGuts,9,Wed May 6 02:38:38 2015 UTC,Definitely Counterparts.  They are killing it.
melodichardcore,350i93,xintrovert,5,Wed May 6 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Touché Amoré maybe? I think they are a pretty big deal in the genre. I'm not sure about Capsize though, maybe I just accidentally missed their material."
melodichardcore,350i93,zsombro,3,Wed May 6 13:17:54 2015 UTC,"While she sleeps and Polar should be added for sure.   On the other hand, we have such few really popular bands. Most of what I listen to is under 10k likes on facebook, and they sound so much different from our bands with 100k plus. Whos leading? Or are we going with who is popular? Id say crooks, dependence, casey, Lakota de kai are really the ones shaping what melo HC is becoming. But again, not as popular."
melodichardcore,350i93,Janaar,2,Thu May 7 22:31:35 2015 UTC,The new WSS Album is fucking sick. I saw them live in Munich. Crowd was not that good but they were amazing. One of the best albums of 2015 for me.  Ah and Lakota de kai..EP was really good. too bad that they split with the singer. At least thats what I heard.
melodichardcore,350i93,MyMindsWeapon,1 point,Fri May 8 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"Fuck that sucks, the singer was pretty much the band. Like Letlive."
melodichardcore,350i93,Janaar,1 point,Fri May 8 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"It's understandable to see it like this, but it just isn't right. Loz was the last one to join Sleeps in 2010 while the others were around since... 2006 I think? A long time in any case. They're a very homogenous group of people and every one of them is f'ing exciting to watch on stage. When I saw them in Karlsruhe, Aaran and Mat jumped off stage and moshed with their instruments. Meanwhile, Jason Aalon is the last remaining member of the original lineup and he pretty much defines what letlive. is about. Sure, the other members bring their own stuff in, but it's not as homogenous as Sleeps.  I'm sorry for rambling, but I love both bands to death and I want to talk about them all day so I'm pretty much all over everything that's being said about them."
melodichardcore,350i93,yourmindsdecide,7,Fri May 8 16:32:51 2015 UTC,I'd add Being As An Ocean to that list as well
melodichardcore,350i93,DeadBlessings,-3,Wed May 6 02:45:22 2015 UTC,"To put BAAO in the same league as Touché Amoré, Defeater and Counterparts is honestly pretty ridiculous."
melodichardcore,350i93,Counterfarts,4,Wed May 6 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"While you may not like them as much, they're definitely one of the bigger bands in the genre, and personally, I feel like they deserve to be. If nothing else, they have amazing lyrics."
melodichardcore,350i93,DeadBlessings,1 point,Wed May 6 16:31:26 2015 UTC,BAAO is pretty good at promoting and ish.

melodichardcore,350i93,TacoCorpOfficial,1 point,Wed May 6 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"I assumed he meant BAAO didn't stack up against them because they didn't have as much of an impact on the scene. I was stating they have a larger following than those bands, and are definitely a genre leader right now. They are massive (in terms of melodic-hardcore bands anyway)"
melodichardcore,350i93,keenankoso,0,Wed May 6 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thats because there are too many tumblr boys/girls who flock to anything ""dark and artsy""."

melodichardcore,34kxou,asleeplessmalice,2,Sat May 2 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'll check with the venue before hand, some wont let you in with any professional looking cameras (any camera with detachable lens)."
melodichardcore,34kxou,iseenorocks,1 point,Sat May 2 02:48:45 2015 UTC,If it's a basic camera (as in not a professional one) it's ok in most venues as long as you turn the flash off. Whether or not it's worth the risk of it getting damaged is up to you.
melodichardcore,34kxou,DeadBlessings,1 point,Sat May 2 03:00:08 2015 UTC,"I'd only recommend it if you're a professional photographer. If you're looking to get into taking pictures of bands, that's awesome! However, it's better to get started shooting at shows for your local bands. You'll make a lot of friends that way, too. It would just suck if you broke your equipment, and some venues are very picky about cameras.  Just enjoy being at the show. It always kind of bums me out when people stand around on their phones or cameras at a really, really cool show. Music is an experience."

melodichardcore,33pya2,SomeHandsomeDevil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:11:10 2015 UTC,No Saviour was my favorite track off their new record. I wish this tour came through my state!

melodichardcore,33pya2,ironicirenic,2,Fri Apr 24 17:50:24 2015 UTC,I thought all of Letters Home was right up there as some of their best work
melodichardcore,33pya2,DeadBlessings,2,Fri Apr 24 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"Letters home was one of the most emotional albums they've done in my opinion.  It has so many emotions besides anger,  there is so much regret and feeling like he never lived up to his family/brothers expectations. Sleepless days/Empty nights is a close second though."
melodichardcore,33pya2,Alivebydesign,2,Fri Apr 24 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, Letters Home was my favorite of theirs, with Empty Days/Sleepless Nights as a close second. Not that Travels or Lost Ground were bad at all though"
melodichardcore,33pya2,DeadBlessings,2,Fri Apr 24 19:56:06 2015 UTC,Travels and Lost Ground are both amazing as well.  I do think that in terms of how memorable the albums are they fall short of Letters home and Sleepless days though.  With how much of a turn Letters home was I'm very excited to hear the new album!!

melodichardcore,33pya2,DeadBlessings,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:37:02 2015 UTC,"Here's the setlist if anyone wanted to see it.  I enjoyed all of the show, but wish they played more songs, especially off their first two albums.  I figured they never got a chance to properly tour for Letter's Home and they've already finished tracking a new album, so they'd better play those songs while they can.  I could have done without a few of them like Rabbit Foot and Dead Set.  I also didn't think Bled Out was that good of an encore, its just felt a bit slow.  Capsize was fun, but the singer needs to up his game.  Even in good studio quality stuff like audiotree he sounds like he's mumbling the whole time.  Counterparts was pretty much flawless, definitely lived up to their reputation and sounded just like the recordings.  Sadly about half the venue left after Counterparts. I knew they were popular, but I thought people would want to see Defeater too. :("
melodichardcore,33pya2,Pandos636,2,Fri Apr 24 19:41:40 2015 UTC,What about Hotel Books?
melodichardcore,33pya2,-bearh-,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"I missed their set.  I really wanted to see them too :(  I got to the show halfway through Better Off's set, they were very out of place, more like an alt rock or indie band.  The one thing I'll say about them is they should have pulled out a cover to win over the crowd.  As an alt/indie rock band playing to an audience of punk kids, a well timed cover of [Sowing Season]() would have made everyone think ""hey, these guys aren't that bad"".  Instead the crowd was just waiting for them to leave so Capsize could come out."
melodichardcore,33pya2,Pandos636,2,Fri Apr 24 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"I actually think that's a really good list, the best of each album plus a bunch more from Letters Home. I don't think they really could've done much better without making the sat longer."
melodichardcore,33pya2,DeadBlessings,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"A longer set would have been ideal, but if we're confined to 12 songs I would have dropped Dead Set and Rabbit Foot and brought out some crowd favorites like Warm Blood Rush or Forgiver, Forgetter.  If they insisted on played stuff from the 3rd album, I think Hopeless Again and Blood in my Veins are better songs.  Brothers was a weird choice too, in the past they've played I Don't Mind and/or But Breathing.  I was singing my heart out for Brothers, but I don't think the crowd liked it as much as the band did."
melodichardcore,33pya2,Pandos636,2,Fri Apr 24 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think Warm Blood Rush instead of Dead Set would've been good, but I would've kept Rabbit Foot. I am a bit biased though, since Rabbit Foot is probably my favorite Defeater song  Edit: Also, Brothers is my favorite of their acoustic songs, so I'm glad they played that one"
melodichardcore,33pya2,DeadBlessings,2,Fri Apr 24 20:41:31 2015 UTC,I've never understood the concept of leaving early/arriving late to a show. You paid for the entire thing. Why shortchange yourself?
melodichardcore,33pya2,Pandos636,2,Fri Apr 24 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid we'd ALWAYS be standing in that line waiting for doors to open, every show sometimes for a couple hours.  Now that I'm older I've got too many responsibilities and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions that result in missing part of a show.  I'm disappointed in missing Hotel Books because I think they are unique and wanted to see how they hold up live, but I'm happy that I got to the venue in time to catch Capsize, Counterparts and Defeater because they were all fun.  For a $13 ticket, I don't feel short-changed.  I could picture fans of a band like Better Off getting the fuck out after their set, you can't always expect cross-genre shows to go over well with fans.  I took my wife to see Knuckle Puck last year and she left to hang out with a friend while I stayed for To The Wind, No Bragging Rights, and Senses Fail.  Great concert, but she would have hated it if I made her stay for the whole thing."

melodichardcore,33dq6b,junglist918,7,Tue Apr 21 18:16:14 2015 UTC,Chadwick must have changed his vocal technique or something? It sounds a lot different.
melodichardcore,33dq6b,TheNewerMcRib,5,Tue Apr 21 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"He seems to be doing more pitched screams, I personally really like it"
melodichardcore,33dq6b,DeadBlessings,3,Tue Apr 21 21:23:35 2015 UTC,After a few listens I actually got into it. It threw me off at first. I think this is exactly what they need.
melodichardcore,33dq6b,TheNewerMcRib,3,Tue Apr 21 21:57:02 2015 UTC,Agreed
melodichardcore,33dq6b,DeadBlessings,3,Tue Apr 21 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"I respect their change, however I'm not a big fan of the new vocals. Will have to listen to the whole album to decide though, I have hope!"

Honestly, I ask him the same question pretty frequently and I still can't figure it out, haha. From what I've gathered, he kind of does this falsetto note that he pushes into a scream if that makes sense."
melodichardcore,338uua,I_Nut_In_Butts,2,Tue Apr 21 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that.  Anyways you both kill it... A+ drumming, especially, their drummer is a monster."

They are one of the most popular and successful hardcore bands around, it would be foolish of them to call it quits when they are one the very few bands in the genre actually monetizing their music."
melodichardcore,31tlef,bojank33,6,Wed Apr 8 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"They introduce a few characters in each album and they could always spin of the storyline to one of them.

melodichardcore,31tlef,Pandos636,2,Wed Apr 8 06:56:58 2015 UTC,Context?  Blind guess: A band's name  is a powerful brand  so they might as well continue.

melodichardcore,31t1hd,thyfoolish1,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"Just listened to this. I guess this is your first song? It's quite impressive how well the instrumentals work together. Especially that piano interlude, you don't hear that very often. Harsh vocals also sounded solid, although they didn't flow well at some points. The cleans were a joke though, whoever does that should either take lessons or cut it completely. I honestly thought you were kidding me when I heard that.  Lyrics are alright, although I didn't quite get what the song was about at first. There's definitely room for improvement there."

melodichardcore,31morz,SevenHarmlessSins,17,Mon Apr 6 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"For me, the biggest draw to those three you named is the strength in lyricism they all have. The tunes are great too, but the quality of the lyrics are really want drew me to keep listening to them.  Unfortunately, I don't know of too many newer melodic hardcore acts that can rivial them. I'll list what I consider some close matches, as well as a couple bands that match lyricism very well but not exactly ""melodic hardcore.""    Citycop  Interesting take on melodic punk/hardcore in that Acoustic guitar is the lead instead of electric. Dude can still play some furious, blistering tempo punk, but is also able to make use of the more melodic sounds of an acoustic. Vocalist reminds me a lot of TA, in style and lyric writing.    The Carrier  More harsh melodic hardcore, and really similar in style to Defeater at times. Really gets you pumped and energetic though, and lyrics focus on a lot of the emotional/personal aspects that the bands you listed do.    Killing the Dream  Another harsher melodic hardcore act in that there's very little ""clean"" singing, but still highly passionate and musically similar to TA, Defeater, and La Dispute's more punk/hardcore influenced songs.    Miles Away  A bit harsher/louder as TA/Defeater/La Dipuste, but has a similar guitar tone and song writing as them. Also focuses on really heartfelt, passionate lyrical delivery during slow clean, melodic build-ups/breakdowns.    Title Fight  A bit more pop-punk influenced (and just plain pop on newer albums), but still some good energy, melodic hardcore punk that's hard not to sing along with after a few listens. They also have done some acoustic covers and songs (similar to defeater) which is alright on it's own right.    American Nightmare/Give Up The Ghost   The best match in lyrical content imo. Lyricist [Wesley Eisold](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Eisold) is widely cited as an influence on those you listed, and many other bands.)  They're more of the 90s/early 00s hardcore style, and there are very few vocal parts I'd consider ""clean"" although he does possess a great more clarity in his harsh vocal style than a lot of acts. That helps make it easier to pick up on some lyrics easily and hear most all of them clearly after you've read them over and become more familiar with the songs.  Musically, they do play with more melody and have more diverse song writing than a lot of traditional hardcore punk acts, but I wouldn't 100% call it melodic hardcore. For me they set the standard for me with what good lyric writing in hardcore could be, and broke a lot of barriers in sound and style during their time.  (Fun Fact, Wes won a plagarism lawsuit against Fall Out Boy for ripping off his lyrics without permission.)    Poison The Well  Post-hardcore/metalcore more than melodic hardcore, especially on the first 4 albums or so, but I feel what they did in the 90s/00s helped pave the way musically for the more recent wave of melodic hardcore and post-hardcore, and metalcore.  Still has some great lyricism and is a fun listen, but best enjoyed with some context to the time period. They helped bridge a lot of separate styles of punk/hardcore/metal when scenes seemed to be pushing towards more ""pure"" ""brutal"" or ""heavy"" acts.  They showed you could have punk/hardcore aggression, experiment with more melody/clean singing, be technically proficient, and pull it all off without sacrificing too much in any area. Because of their relative success and influence, there's was more attention and interest towards more melodic and experimental alternatives towards what could be done with punk/hardcore/metal."

There will be no album better than this in my opinion, and I'm so glad that they are back and that Loz kept his voice after the throat surgery. I can't wait to see them in Frankfurt/Karlsruhe this month.  Other bands that are somewhat similar are Darkest Hour and... maybe... Obey The Brave? Sleeps really do have a unique sound, so giving recommendations is hard. If you want to dig a bot further into the genre itself check out Counterparts, Stick To Your Guns, The Ghost Inside, Hundredth, Polar and Burning Down Alaska."

I'm not a big fan of genre lables and there is definatly a crossover with 'metalcore' and 'melodic hardcore'  Yeah, it's great to see Loz and the band back. I admit I did forget about them a bit. Also, what do you think about The North Stands for Nothing. I know's its only a half-album of sorts. But it's my favourite album of theirs and I always go back to it. It's hard to explain with words it but it really unique atmosphere and harmonies which you don't find in their last two albums."

She said 10 bucks each. Like, seriously? I'm not paying 10 bucks for 5 songs that's not how this works. Ended up buying Resist and feeling ripped off.  So yeah.

melodichardcore,317y32,jewdogg420,7,Thu Apr 2 18:42:18 2015 UTC,Fuck yes! So happy for Wes. I dont believe what Climates wrote about him.
melodichardcore,317y32,Janaar,3,Thu Apr 2 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"Out of the loop, whatd tgey write about him?"
melodichardcore,317y32,Clint_Swift,3,Thu Apr 2 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the wall of text coming.  Tl;dr is they thought Wes was lazy and selfish and pessimistic. As well as wanting the band to go in a different direction.   From their Facebook:  ""This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make as a band and as individuals, but it was not made without a LOT of thought, consideration and discussion. It was not a decision that we made off-hand and callously, and it was not even something we wanted to talk about openly so soon as we were hoping for a little time to heal and figure things out. But, with Wes making his feelings so public this past week, we’ve been left with little option but to let you all know our perspective. The truth of the matter is, we as a band have become increasingly unhappy with Wes’ contribution to Climates, not only as a vocalist and frontman but also in terms of attitude and outlook. In terms of performance, we have been asking him for the best part of this year to improve his abilities as a live vocalist; we even used band funds to pay for vocal lessons for him, but it made very little difference.  Wes was the driving force behind bringing more vocal melody into the Climates sound, and yet he seemed resistant to improving his abilities so that he could actually perform his parts live to a suitable standard, which is not something we really understood as musicians. The four of us all work hard to be the best musicians we can be, and we regularly rehearse our instruments, both separately and together, but Wes did not appear to share this dedication to his instrument.  We raised these concerns with him on multiple occasions, and yet he showed us very little in the way of effort and improvement - it seemed as though he already felt he was good enough, and what we thought didn’t really matter. In terms of attitude, Wes seemed to be on a very different page to us; he was often a very negative and pessimistic person, who was unhappy with what Climates was achieving. He would regularly draw comparison between us and our more successful peers, and vent his frustration that we are still a band with a long road ahead of us.  It was also becoming increasingly apparent that we did not share the same musical vision for Climates; Wes wanted us to move in a more melodic rock direction and become a band in the vein of Mallory Knox, which is not a desire that we shared. Wes did not write any of our music. His contribution was lyrics and vocal parts (although Sam wrote about 50% of those), and we do not wish to take away from the elements that he did bring to our songs, we all remain proud of the recordings we made together over the past two years.  However, by the same token, there is a lot more to this band than just vocals, and regardless of who originally formed the band, Climates is just that - a band. Climates is not a solo project, and it does not exist today because of one single person. We understand that many of you are shocked at this turn of events, but we hope that you can understand our perspective, stand by us through this time of transition and keep an open mind as to what the future holds for our band. Climates is very important to us, and we have all worked very hard on it these past few years - too hard to let is fall apart due to differences with one member. All that being said, we wish Wes all the very best for his future endeavours, and thank him for the good times over the past few years. Thank you for reading, we hope to see you all very soon."""

I think the decreased set time was in part due to Counterparts having quite a good chunk of time. Lots of people seemed to come out for just them rather than Defeater. Also the fact that 5 bands are on the tour contributes to the length of the set.  As for the the new song, maybe they just didn't feel comfortable with the music yet to play it live? Could also be that they might just release the album and go on another tour with that new album sometime in the next year. That's just my speculation though."

melodichardcore,30u6x8,TheNewerMcRib,2,Thu Apr 2 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"They played pretty much all from the Angst in My Veins. They had a surprisingly shitty sound quality on their amps. Could have just been an exception that day, but it was super muddy."
melodichardcore,30u6x8,FinalVersus,3,Thu Apr 2 17:56:59 2015 UTC,I saw that too and thought it was weird because Counterparts was said to be playing 11 songs as well.

melodichardcore,30u6x8,DeadBlessings,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Saw them last night in Atlanta and it was incredible, one of the best live performances I've ever seen. In regards to the set list, that's it. The doors opened at 630 and defeater didn't play like 1040 and were done around 1115. There are just a lot of openers and the Atlanta date had 1 more act, fireworks, who totally killed the mood. they were sandwiched between counterparts and defeater and a lot of the crowd went outside and skipped fireworks set. So, in short, there really isn't time on this tour for them to play Longer especially since counterparts were given a lot of time which they deserved (they were great also). Fuck fireworks tho man, they ruined the vibe of the show so much. At leastdefeater came out right after and killed it."

Also just a disclaimer for Evergreen Terrace, they've been around for a while now and they have albums closer to traditional melohxc and others closer to metalcore, so try a good amount of their songs to find out which albums you might be more into (likely their newer stuff haha). But yeah happy jamming man!"
melodichardcore,300u1k,Megakenny,2,Mon Mar 23 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"Most actual hardcore bands, not the stuff that is in thread, steer away from breakdowns. Some bands like Hundreth and Counterparts will use them sparingly. Honestly, though within the scene breakdowns in the sense that you're looking for are looked down upon by a lot a people. Try out Shai Hulud, Have Heart, Trapped Under Ice, Converge, Code Orange, Turnstile, Harm's Way Comeback Kid, Expire, and Verse for a good assortment of bands, past and present, that play actual hardcore but tend to have heavy parts that people who like breakdowns like in my experience."
melodichardcore,300u1k,Megakenny,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:46:26 2015 UTC,I figured that was the case. I just really enjoyed the sound of a few of those bands that used breakdowns but couldn't quite find anyone else like them yet. I'll keep looking! Thanks for this

melodichardcore,2z7rpi,PowerRangersFreak,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"Metallica was thrash, meaning they took influence from punk, thats why the lead is similar, because melodic hardcore is a type of punk"
melodichardcore,2z7rpi,keepitcutthroat,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:32:24 2015 UTC,The era of Metallica I'm reffering to (wah pedal solos) definetely isn't Thrash.
melodichardcore,2z7rpi,PowerRangersFreak,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:59:02 2015 UTC,then maybe you just dont know the difference
melodichardcore,2z7rpi,keepitcutthroat,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"Please note the difference so I will know from here and on. I'm not being sarcastic, I actually want other people's view on the subject."
melodichardcore,2z7rpi,PowerRangersFreak,3,Mon Mar 16 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"the main differences can be seen in the guitar and the vocals  the vocals are the most obvious probably, theyre shouted or barked the way hardcore shouts are done rather than growled or screamed. The guitar is a bit harder to explain, but basically, the initial lead is traditional hardcore fused with the slow twang and harmonies of 90's emo. One the song kicks in the guitar focuses on chord progression rather than lead, one of the defining differences between punk and metal. The solo is just a solo, lots of genres have them. Around the three minute mark, the chords are traded in for basic tremelo picking, this is where the melodic becomes prevalent in melodic hardcore. The last thing id like to point out is the heavy usage of gang shouts, a technique almost completely unique to punk  I apologize if theres still confusion, but i tried to explain the best I could"
melodichardcore,2z7rpi,keepitcutthroat,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"I've come to accept this because, really, I have no choice. But While She Sleeps just sound so vastly different to every other band in this genre. I mean, they really don't sound like any other band at all, but if I had to group them together with others, I'd rather choose some Melodic Metalcore band like Darkest Hour. In some cases, Trophies of Violence for example, I'd even go as far as to compare them with early Slipknot. Grouping them together with stuff like The Ghost Inside or Stick To Your Guns just feels like I do them an injustice.  And after all, we're arguing about arbitrary lines we draw. These arguments really don't hold any value other than to get pissed off at others and I'd get laughed at if I started discussing these bollocks anywhere but on the internet."

melodichardcore,2z1sbo,rascalmonster,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"Opened with dear youth, then played between the lines, then unspoken. Also played move me, great unknown, this is what I know about sacrifice, then the song after that on the CD (I forget the name). Also played faith or forgiveness, mercy, and dark horse. Then they ""finished"", everyone chants for one more song, then they play avalanche and finish with engine 45. Overall decent show, tgi killed it obviously but I'm not a big fan of AS or Gideon, I was excited to see in heart's wake but I think where I was standing in the corner the bass echoed and it was overly loud. When I moved the sound was better. But enjoy the show!"
melodichardcore,2yyblr,Jellyboi911,5,Fri Mar 13 21:19:06 2015 UTC,I saw them on the 22nd (day after the video) and it sounds so much better live. Also it reminds of stuff from Prophets. Love it.
melodichardcore,2yyblr,PowerRangersFreak,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:42:01 2015 UTC,It actually reminds me of a lot of some of the breakdowns from Code Orange's I am King. I really wouldn't mind if CP went for a heavier sound

I usually try to play some drop chords and riff a bit at the same time. But it always ends up sounding more like sludge metal and I miss the 'melodic' sound, do you get this sounds solely by the lead guitar or does the rhythm guitar also contribute to this? sorry if I may bother you, but it would help me out a lot :3"
melodichardcore,2yis1b,shadowxxs6,2,Tue Mar 10 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"This gonna sound shitty but learn to play some of your favorite songs and then rip them off a little bit.

melodichardcore,2yhwdl,alexxxpoling,3,Mon Mar 9 23:10:37 2015 UTC,Aww man that sucks. It seems like they just began to gain traction. When they continue with the band they'll basically have to start from zero again.
melodichardcore,2yhwdl,yourmindsdecide,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think it gives them time to build hype.  Defeater just finished their 1 year hiatus and I couldn't be more pumped to see them next month.  It also gives people some time to really let their last album sink in.  I really liked Cycles, but didn't care for The Concrete Flower until like 6 months after it came out and I gave it another listen.  I'm sure when they come back it'll be with a solid tour line-up and some new fans that missed their chance to see them this last year."

melodichardcore,2xsydl,jewdogg420,9,Tue Mar 3 17:37:06 2015 UTC,Yeah the Front man apparently was a control freak and wanted the band to be like Mallory Knox rather than a hardcore band like the rest of the band wanted. Big problem was that the front man apparently wasn't a very good singer and it took a lot of effort to get what little cleans they did sound right in studio. The band paid a lot of money to get him vocal lessons but the bloke stopped bothering and didn't improve. So they rest of the guys kicked him out and started moving in a direction they wanted to. That's why they renamed the band Blood Youth.

I did like what I heard in the video, especially the post-rockish guitar influence. However (and I seriously hate to be a genre whore) I do not qualify this as melodic hardcore. I don't know what the rest of their stuff sounds like, but it was definitely more spoken word and with this particular song, way too soft to be anything hardcore. And I'm concerned that hardcore styled or post hardcore styled music (Touche Amore, Being As An Ocean) is starting to get bloated as a genre... but that said I will listen to more of their stuff since I am seeing them soon.

Like the 5 of us were friends before this band, but once we formed the band it became more of a family. So that friendship died and was replaced with a family ties sort of bond, I don't wanna use the term brotherhood, but that's what it is. Plus there's a kids book about the dinosaurs called All My Friends Are Dead and that's pretty neat too."

I feel like MeloHC is starting to turn into Metalcore in the sense that there's an immense lack of diversity with new music. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough, or maybe the good stuff is getting drowned out by all the mediocre over-promoted tumblrcore bands. If you know what I mean, and you can suggest any bands that don't fall into this category, feel free to point me in the right direction, because quite frankly it's been a while since anything on this subreddit has interested me."

I know I may have come off as an elitist douche, but it's really frustrating when you are asking for bands that started the subgenre and people are suggesting so much stuff that isn't even hardcore. Most everything in this thread besides /u/Phatman516, /u/bodowned,  and /u/awesomesawse posted is metalcore or post-hardcore not hardcore. Despite what many people seem to think The Ghost Inside, Stick to Your Guns, and all the bands that copy them are not hardcore bands. They're metalcore bands that got huge because hardcore is ""in"" and catchy choruses and breakdowns are marketable. Since they have noticeable influence from hardcore in their music they are a labels wet dream. That said, calling them hardcore is like calling Taylor Swfit's early music country. Sure, it has influence from country but it's clearly pop. Bands like TGI and STYG have influence from hardcore but are pretty clearly metalcore."

Expire is not melodic hardcore, but since you listen to metalcore I think you might like em.  Probably my favorite hardcore/punk band right now.  Comeback Kid is on the heavier side of melodic hardcore (not like FFTD or Gideon though), but very punk-influenced and pretty solid overall.  For the Fallen Dreams is more on the metalcore side anyway, but they're pretty solid.  Modern Life is War is a very cool, very punky melodic hardcore band.  Killing the Dream is a little more chaotic, but still cool melodic hardcore band.  Gideon is fairly similar to FFTD in style, I think at least; heavier with a bit of a melodic undertone.  Casey Jones is very punky and very cool.  Sort of similar in style to Comeback Kid.  No Bragging Rights has a pretty decent mix of clean/harsh vocals, so they might be a good transition from metalcore/post-hardcore.  To the Wind is pretty cool, some heavier riffs in there.  Another one that might be a good transition band.  Trapped Under Ice is not melodic hardcore, but super punk influenced and very cool New York style hardcore.  Backtrack is also a very cool, very punky New York style hardcore band.  Until We are Ghosts is a really cool melodic hardcore band.  Similar to counterparts in the way their guitarists riff.  Your Demise is more of a straight up hardcore punk band, but they are really cool.  Some singing, and probably the first 'hardcore' band I ever listened to.  Very good for transitioning from metalcore/post-hardcore IMO.  This is probably their most popular record, but The Golden Age was what got me into them.  To each their own.

melodichardcore,2v09qq,alextico24,3,Fri Feb 6 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"I love this album, not as much as Diamond or The Hope Division but they are tough albums to beat. Can't wait for my preorder to arrive."
melodichardcore,2v09qq,satan-says-meow,7,Sat Feb 7 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"I am a huge STYG fan and coming into this album I feel they could do no wrong. There are a couple of songs I like but I am really let down by this album. Maybe I need to listen to it a couple more times but It seems like every other song sounds the same and have to have a catchy chorus. ""Left you Behind"" just doesn't fit. Maybe I am expecting too much but they could they have done the song like ""Reflection"" from Counterparts. Just a song full of raw emotion but no we get a song that sounds like it should be played on the radio. With an album with a theme of being ""disobedient"" they just don't seem as pissed off as they should. Now downvote me to oblivion."
melodichardcore,2v09qq,arcminion,2,Sat Feb 7 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that Diamond was just so insanely tough to follow. With Diamond, you had an album that not only had a cohesive concept, but a title AND a logo that all fit perfectly together and that had a title track with a reprise to tie everything up perfectly into this incredible concept of an album.  ""Disobedient"" feels a lot less cohesive. Like... you've got the title ""Disobedient"", and there are definitely some songs that really fit that theme, but then there are some outliers that, while they are good songs, don't reaaaaaaally have the feel of that theme. And I don't get exactly what the infinity symbol has to do with Disobedient. The title track isn't even a song, it's just a quote (which they could have easily put at the beginning/end of another song)... It just all makes a lot less sense than Diamond. Do I like the album? Absolutely. Do I think Diamond was better? Absolutely. And do I think that it had something to do with the guy they produced the new album with? Abbbbsolutely (and I too, am an insanely die-hard STYG fan, so yes, I get it haha)"

melodichardcore,2v09qq,normcollison,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:05:01 2015 UTC,I really like the acoustic bonus tracks though. Although I did really enjoy the the We Still Believe acoustic track that they did so it could just be a taste preference.

melodichardcore,2v09qq,Oprama2016,6,Sat Feb 7 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"This album is great. More melodic than ever, pretty catchy but still heavy as fuck. Don't think the vocals are overproduced at all. Whatever ""overproduced"" means. They are no longer pissed-off 18 year old kids. Every band grows and the way STYG has been growing is the right way, in my opinion..  I am not from Orange County (or the US at all), but I can see this band grow to be compared to one of the OCHC greats. The Ignite influence on Nothing You Can Do To Me is already there anyway, and what a sick track it is. And 'I Choose Nothing' pissed me off in the best way possible.  This is their best album yet and I am seriously wondering how they can beat this. Ofcourse I can understand how some people don't like it. I am definitely loving the hell out of this!"
melodichardcore,2v09qq,furialel,2,Fri Feb 6 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"It's like The Ghost Inside without the mindless chugging and shitty Pop-Punk sound.   I've never really listened to Stick to Your Guns, someone give me a good place to start."

melodichardcore,2uebo6,gypononymous,2,Sun Feb 1 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"La Dispute and Defeater are part of the same ""group"" of bands that self-deprecatingly called themselves The Wave a few years back. They've all got a similar feel in the emotional post-hardcore stuff, but with lots of different takes.  Touche Amore is very much hardcore punk-influenced. Check out their second album, Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me . Pianos Become the Teeth started as a rather generic post-hardcore group, but their most recent work Keep You is a damn good synthesis of melodic hardcore and indie rock with a shoegaze production quality. Make Do And Mend is the fifth member of the group of friends, but I honestly don't listen to them too much. I don't think they've found their footing as well as the other four, but they still warrant a listen.  Otherwise, check the shit out of Modern Life Is War. If you want some feelings, listen to Witness. Tracks 6-8 form a shiver-inducing suite. Also look into At the Drive-In's Relationship of Command, which is the prototype of these types of bands. Cloud Nothings' album Attack on Memory is a bit similar to the Pianos Become the Teeth blend of melodic post-hardcore and indie rock. Tracks ""Stay Useless"" and ""Fall In"" are the best, and the lyrics are immediately relatable."

They did a final mini tour of two shows in their hometown of Mt Gambier and Melbourne, Australia. Me and my friends did a small roadtrip and drove 16 hours to see them for their last shows and it was incredible. We talked with the singer Brett and he was one of the most genuine people I've ever met. The world lost an incredible piece of it the day Sierra broke up."

melodichardcore,2rh2jj,Pandos636,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:33:27 2015 UTC,Is it bad that I can't tell which of those bands you think belong in which genre?  I mean ADTR has released songs that stretch from alt rock to poppunk to -core genres.
melodichardcore,2rh2jj,asleeplessmalice,0,Fri Jan 9 18:56:36 2015 UTC,If you can't tell the difference between the story so far and chunk no captain chunk/a day to remember then everything must sound the same to you.
melodichardcore,2rh2jj,Pandos636,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"I was questioning what genre YOU think those bands are since you listed them all like its obvious.  I can't stand Chunk and don't listen to them, but I think they are easycore?  They use a lot of synth right?  ADTR is somewhere between poppunk and post-hardcore depending on the album/song.  TSSF is (Tr00) poppunk, heavier poppunk without the dog fucking jokes and other stupid shit.  Such Gold sounds like Melodic hardcore to me, but I guess you could call it poppunk too, reminds me of Title Fight.  Citizen started as an easycore band, but their other releases are mostly post-grunge citing Brand New and Nirvana as their biggest influences.  All that aside, I always considered FYS easycore."
melodichardcore,2rh2jj,asvigny,-3,Fri Jan 9 21:00:42 2015 UTC,Shhh... that's too easy..
melodichardcore,2rh2jj,Buckwheat33,0,Tue Jan 6 05:22:07 2015 UTC,They have melodic hardcore breakdowns though and they're so niiiiiiice
melodichardcore,2rh2jj,lazenbooby,2,Tue Jan 6 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why we're being downvoted. ""Easycore"" is clearly a more melodic sub-genre of hardcore. Whatever. Music elitists."

melodichardcore,2r7cqd,caseyfoor,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:53:44 2015 UTC,It seems their last two were more melodic hardcore and the upcoming album has more 'party rock' in it. Was trying to figure that out by posting it here.

melodichardcore,2r138w,apopalo44,14,Thu Jan 1 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"Reflection. From the very first line: ""I've never told this to anyone..."" Not talking about feelings is something I struggle with a lot. Also, the last lines of the song: ""so I will pray to a God that isn't there, to a world that doesn't hear, to anyone who will listen, to keep me from becoming everything I promised myself I will never be. I do not deserve this."" It hits so hard, especially coming from a very religious family but no longer identifying myself. All of their songs are very emotional and relatable, but reflection tears me down so hard."
melodichardcore,2r138w,ironicirenic,4,Thu Jan 1 20:03:17 2015 UTC,I actually believe in God and this song is still very amazing. Losing faith in a higher power when you're at your all time low happens and this song is perfectly describing such a state.

melodichardcore,2r138w,MrCoolPantz,6,Sun Jan 4 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks Witness is a word for word perfect description of depression. Soil also has the lyric ""I am not fit to walk among you, but I don't want to end my life. Just know that if I knew of any common ground, I'd leave here now and I would find a home that I could die in. Just to say I tried to rest in peace."" Means a lot to me."
melodichardcore,2r138w,Janaar,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:02:55 2015 UTC,Witness is the perfect representation of depression. But not the attention seeking kind. Like people who physically just feel sad all the time and just try to live their regular life. I listen to it once a day no lie. And It usually makes me feel better. Haha

It feels like nothing good will stay, unless I stay the same. I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty.""  and despite the negativity the song ends on such an empowering note of ""I refuse to let fear define me"" A line I will one day have tattooed."

melodichardcore,2qxwzm,KiwiCore,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:59:21 2015 UTC,I agree. And I kind of wish they'd bring back elements from this album like the lyrics. Definitely some heavier stuff.
melodichardcore,2qxwzm,KiwiCore,1 point,Thu Jan 1 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"To me this will always be their best, but I have to say that dear youth is just such a powerful album - for different reasons. Clearly vigil has a lot to say this time round, and whilst I love his lyrical content for fury and the fallen ones and the general uplifting nature of the music dear youth shows the growth of the band like no other. Having Jason Butler piece on wide eyed was just awesome, still fucking heavy all round but the new perspective is quite refreshing. What you reckon?"
melodichardcore,2qxwzm,KiwiCore,1 point,Thu Jan 1 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, they definitely hit their stride with this one. I do enjoy the uplifting lyrical content they bring. I wonder if their bassist change brought that about after Fury and The Fallen Ones?"

I also really love Wide Eyed, Mercy and Phoenix Flame  Edit: damn, can't believe i left off Dear Younth, one of the best songs on the album. Also, The Other Half and Blank Pages are really really good."

melodichardcore,2pz59q,colesun,2,Sun Dec 21 21:05:37 2014 UTC,"Could you elaborate and how it was boring? To me it sounded relatively similar to their previous albums, maybe with darker lyrics and better production but overall their sound hasn't changed much."
melodichardcore,2pz59q,ToasterDave,3,Mon Dec 22 05:21:05 2014 UTC,The guitars felt very tame compared to Fury and the Fallen Ones
melodichardcore,2pz59q,firestorm6,2,Mon Dec 22 07:39:06 2014 UTC,Come on. The guitars sounded tame tame in the returners if your gonna compare it to the first album..NOTHING will live up to Fury in my opinion

melodichardcore,2pz59q,ToasterDave,2,Mon Dec 22 21:46:14 2014 UTC,You just explained why it's boring. It's not fresh. Nobody wants a band to put out the same album every other year for their whole career.
melodichardcore,2pz59q,brianl95,1 point,Thu Dec 25 12:40:13 2014 UTC,I think what we have here is a case of someone who set their expectations too high lol I heard Avalanche and Dear Youth knew that the album was going to be Give What You Get 2.0
melodichardcore,2pz59q,ToasterDave,1 point,Thu Dec 25 12:58:41 2014 UTC,"Again, Get what you give 2.0. That's boring that's the same album they put out 2 years ago.

melodichardcore,2pz59q,brianl95,1 point,Thu Dec 25 13:15:11 2014 UTC,Yeah would agree for a more progressive band such as August Burns Red but not for The Ghost Inside. They aren't exactly breaking any new ground in this genre.
melodichardcore,2pz59q,ToasterDave,1 point,Thu Dec 25 13:21:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah but returners and fury and the fallen ones don't sound the same. Get what you give and returners don't sound the same. But dear youth and get what you give do. Stale to me, but that's just my opinion."

melodichardcore,2nhout,yourmindsdecide,2,Wed Nov 26 16:49:22 2014 UTC,such a fantastic song! Altough I wonder if it wouldn't be more accurate to post this in /r/metalcore ?
melodichardcore,2nhout,zsombro,3,Wed Nov 26 17:04:08 2014 UTC,"Last time I suggested to the mods of /r/Metalcore that While She Sleeps is indeed a Metalcore and not Melodic Hardcore, I got this response:    As for While She Sleeps - which I've tried posting several times in the last few weeks - you're just straight up wrong for removing it. They're taking a bit of Melodic Hardcore influence, but they're clearly Metalcore. Hell, they've even got a flair.   I apologize for the flair, we have been working on re-doing the flair system for quite a while now, and we still have some flairs that need to be removed, the WSS flair was added from a request in the flair thread as was every other one, the flair will be removed shortly to avoid confusion. As for WSS being metalcore, adding to my previous paragraph, WSS has hardcore shouted vocals, rhythmic punk oriented drum patterns, guitar leads which avoid legato and based form out of punk chord progression. They have just no metal influence, and I totally understand the confusion.  I hope i helped clear things up"
melodichardcore,2nhout,zsombro,2,Wed Nov 26 17:27:31 2014 UTC,"Interesting. I'm not an expert on drums, but I think if you look at only this one song, it's full of rock and heavy metal influenced drum patterns, that deviate from classic d-beats and others similar punk patterns."
melodichardcore,2nhout,satan-says-meow,3,Wed Nov 26 17:36:51 2014 UTC,"I'd definitely categorize them as Metalcore too. Bear in mind, this was written before any of the new tracks were released and WSS is really evolving with their sound.  I honestly have no idea of how music works. I listen to it as long as it sounds good to my ears. But this whole genre debate that's constantly going on in the -core music subreddits really bothers me. It's a very broad genre and all I really want is a platform to talk about heavy music with breakdowns in it. That's why I saved myself /r/hxc, but I'm too lazy to really make anything with it."

I have been there and understand what you mean, but I'm older now. And as someone who went through the same stuff, let me tell you a couple take aways.    A lot of people do ""good"" things, like donating, charity work, what have you, because God commands it or they go to hell. When I do something good, it's not because I'm doing it to try and not go to hell, it's because I'm doing it because it's the right fucking thing to do. I had a really good year money wise, and so I'm adopting a family for xmas presents. They will never know me, nor I them, I just have their list. I deliver it to the charity doing this, and they make sure the presents get delivered. It doesn't have to be that big of a deal, but when you hold the door for someone, or do anything nice, it's not because of a fear of some being, it's because you're a good fucking person. If there is a heaven, afterlife, or whatever. You lived your life being a good person because it was the right thing to do, not because a god would punish you if you didn't. If whatever afterlife won't accept you because you didn't do x, y, or z in their name, then you don't want to be a part of that anyways.    Music saved my life and is close to me as well."

melodichardcore,2m39j7,GNi33,34,Wed Nov 12 18:15:31 2014 UTC,Bands today don't make much money from music compared to 10-15 years ago so the exposure of streaming services is awesome. We use spotify all the time.

I've got a couple questions I'd like to ask:   Andrew, when you first joined The Ghost Inside, what would you say was the biggest change from when you were with For The Fallen Dreams? Do you feel like your drumming style changed significantly after playing with a new group of musicians? Aaron, being a vegan on the road presents a lot of challenges as you expressed in your peta2 interview awhile back. How do you manage adhering to your diet and do the other members (jokingly) tease you about it from time to time? Jonathan, if you had to root for another team other than the LA Kings, who would you root for? Zach and Jim, the rhythm section of any heavy band is a crucial component to keeping the energy up and moving during live performances. Was it difficult to lock in with Andrew and his drumming after KC's departure from the band, or did it all happen pretty seamlessly? To the whole band, to me, Dear Youth as an album is about being able to grow and learn from our past. If you could spend a day with your 12-year old self, what would you do for fun? And also, would you tell them about who they become, or leave it as a surprise for them to discover?   Thank you all for your time and best of luck on your tour. Take care guys."

melodichardcore,2m39j7,willshani,4,Thu Nov 13 02:54:54 2014 UTC,Locking in with Andrew was easy. He's a great drummer. KC has more of a punk style and Andrew come from a more metalcore background so there are small differences in how they play. Both guys crush though!
melodichardcore,2m39j7,AgonizedGrub,6,Wed Nov 12 23:15:39 2014 UTC,The biggest change was the faster punk beats. There wasn't much of that in FTFD so that was the only thing I needed to get used to. -Andrew

You guys really hit it with this one, and Get What You Give.

melodichardcore,2m39j7,FailedDovahkiin,6,Wed Nov 12 23:20:21 2014 UTC,"Hey guys! Thanks a lot for doing this!  I've been at the show in Munich this year on your tour with Asking Alexandria, as I've been to every show you guys do around or in Austria.  For me this particular show was pretty different to any I've attended before mainly because of the crowd that Asking attracted and left a lot like-minded people that were there because of you a little dissapointed (kinda short set, weird front-row crowd, it just didn't feel like a TGI gig).  So my questions would be, how do you feel about these kind of shows where the crowd really is split up because of the difference in style or even genres of the headlining bands?  And, even more important, when can we expect a TGI headlining tour in central Europe? :)  Anyways, been streaming the new album on repeat since you published it, it's amazing! Keep doing what you do!"
melodichardcore,2m39j7,LetsMoshJosh,3,Wed Nov 12 17:56:56 2014 UTC,"Hey guys thank you very much!  I've seen you back in ( i think it was ) 2010  with For the Fallen Dreams and Lower than atlantis in a small bavarian Town called Bayreuth and you've been my favorite Band ever since. (seen you on the US Warped Tour 12 and in Rock in Park 13 - amazing!)  I am in my 20's and trying to get the most of my youth as possible, so the lyrics to Dear Youth really move me. My Question is: Is the song reflecting to a certain point a desire to get back to those days were the path had yet to be chosen and everything was possible or is it maybe a part of processing the realization you are getting older - and your ways can not be changed anymore (at least not without great sacrifice) Altough I am still young I fear that I've already made the wrong choices for being who I really want to be, and not what society and my environment expects and wants me to be. I am pretty sure that is a struggle alot of modern day kids need to face.  And are you absolutely happy with where you are right now?  Oh and I second that request for a tour in Central Europe ( but please not before March 15, as I am currently in Brazil haha)"
melodichardcore,2m39j7,bakeobson,3,Wed Nov 12 19:48:06 2014 UTC,"Hey guys!  First of all, I have to say that Dear Youth is amazing! Your music has always helped me to get through times and keeps me going! Especially Dear Youth since I can relate so well to the lyrics, I think it is lyrically the best record you guys have ever made!  Coming to the questions, I've got 4:   Do you guys connect some songs through your different albums? Looking at Mercy there is a line in the lyrics saying ""Life’s swinging hard but I’m swinging harder."" which somehow feels (to me) connected to Engine 45's ""But I'll keep swinging..."" or Outlive's ""But this time, I stand for this. There’s no space between the lines."" which reminds of Between The Lines part of ""What do you stand for?"" (and the song title itself obviously) So is this just a coincidence? Or is there a special meaning behind this? Are you guys going to explain the meaning behind each song of Dear Youth like you did with Get What You Give? Are you guys planning on coming back to Germany anytime soon? And is there any chance that you might play in smaller places then?Like a small club?

I've listened to the new CD 20 times through already, can't wait to buy it Monday in sf! And I ran into Jonathon at a kings game when they played San Jose, that was awesome. Go kings go  Can't think of any good questions, but I guess if I had to ask one, I'd ask that now you guys are a relatively successful band, do you make your livings off just the band or do you have side jobs when not touring? And where do you guys see yourselves in  5 and 10 years?  Your music is super inspirational and I'm planning on getting my first tattoo with the words Test the Limits, that song means a ton to me."

I just wanted to start off by saying that you guys have been my favorite band for a good while now, and some of your music has gotten me through rough times and Jonathan is someone that I look up to as a person and a performer and he is one of the reasons to why I'm straight edge. So you guys mean a lot to me.  So my question for Zach and Aaron. What have been your favorite guitars to play on tour? And are you endorsed by ESP and Fender respectively? Do you guys have full endorsement or do you just get a discount?  My question for Jonathan. What vocal technique do you use and how do you manage to keep your vocals sounding as amazing as they do throughout an entire tour?  And do any of you still talk to KC, Tyler, Soyer or Garrett? I talked to Soyer on reddit a few years back and he was in the military as far as I can remember.  PS. I met Jonathan and Andrew at the Asking Alexandria show in gothenburg. I basically traveled halfway up the country just to see you guys.  http://i.imgur.com/sGiFv63.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/ao9ey0I.jpg"

How would you describe your progression from record to record? Did you come at Dear Youth in a different way than you have in the past?

How much do you value critics' opinions on your music? Is it important to you that your music has an appeal even to people who are very picky? Or couldn't you care less? As Jason Butler did guest vocals on your new record (hell yeah!), what's your stance on guest appearances in your songs? Will you do more, and how do you think it can enhance the feeling of a song? What band(s) would you like to tour with in the future? Do you ever encounter fans at your shows that are just really awkward, maybe because they're so excited to see you? If yes, what do you think of these people?   Thanks in advance for answering these questions."

melodichardcore,2lto67,KxMadden,13,Mon Nov 10 10:48:55 2014 UTC,"The Ghost Inside definitely is a very solid band, and a good start into the genre. Glad you gave them a listen, most metalheads are very closed-minded when it comes to this. Most bands have already been mentioned, so I'll just give you a little more insight into each band.   Stick To Your Guns: Give their new song Nobody a shot. It's not really the typical 'STYG' sound, but it's the lead single off of their upcoming album, so it's maybe worth a listen. Other songs to listen to include D(I Am)ond, which is my personal favourite, We Still Believe and Amber. All of these are live favourites. Counterparts: Damn I wish I could see them live again. They really nailed it with their newest effort, The Difference Between Hell and Home, but their other albums are worth listening too. For starters though, I'd recommend Witness, Slave and Reflection. All of these put a great emphasis on lyrics, which is why the sub feels so strongly about them. It's about the connection you have to the musicians. And the breakdown in Slave. God damn, that shit's nasty. Hundredth: They've really come a long way since their first album, When Will We Surrender. They abandoned their Christian belief since and are now a completely secular band, and not for their bad. They rarely play anything before their Revolt EP except Weathered Town live. So this is where you want to start. The Revolt EP is a very political one, setting the focus on enviromental problems and the pollution of the earth. And it's not just talk, they helped building wells in poor countries through a water campaign. Songs worth noting include Ruin and Free Mind / Open Spirit. Their new EP, Resist, was way more introspective. It's not long so you could honestly just listen to it as a whole, but I think especially Resist is just fucking well written. While She Sleeps: Alright alright alright. This is my absolute fucking favourite band on this planet, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think their music, their live show, their lyrics, their everything is fucking brilliant. I wouldn't really consider them Melodic Hardcore, but you can't post anything by them on /r/Metalcore anymore so fuck it. You'll want to start at This Is The Six, their debut album, because this is the more accessible of the two albums they've released so far. Check out Our Courage, Our Cancer and Death Toll. For their first mini-album, The North Stands For Nothing, give Crows a listen. They've also got a new album coming out in March next year and you can already listen to one of the new tracks, called New World Torture. It's definitely worth it, check it out! Polar: I've been talking about this band for almost a whole year now. They're from the UK and they're getting on bigger tours than ever right now. They've got a new album out this year, and it's really their best work to date. Give Black Days and Bloodlines a listen. It's just a very refreshing brand of (Post-)Hardcore and if you dig any of the bands above, I seriously recommend these guys to you.   Other bands to listen to include: Climates, Dead Harts, No Bragging Rights, More Than A Thousand, Comeback Kid, Worthwhile, Being As An Ocean and Have Heart. Many people like them, but I haven't listened to any of the bands enough to give you a paragraph like for the ones above."

They are metalcore band (a very good one at that) with some melodic hardcore influences. So don't go in expecting any of the bands I'm going to suggest to sound like them. Hardcore and Melodic Hardcore are generally not as heavy or as polished. It's raw, unbridled, and passionate. All of that said, here is a link to a post I made last time someone asked this question"

melodichardcore,2lto67,SGDrummer7,2,Mon Nov 10 13:57:05 2014 UTC,"While I understand your frustration it doesn't change the fact that they aren't a hardcore band. The only reason I even said anything is because over the last few months this sub has been overrun with TGI, Being as an Ocean, and various other Post-Hardcore/Metalcore posts. These bands aren't hardcore just because they're melodic and slightly less heavy. This sub used to be full of awesome hardcore bands, now half of the posts on the front page aren't even hardcore bands!"
melodichardcore,2lto67,madelikeatree,1 point,Mon Nov 10 13:55:17 2014 UTC,"You're trying to draw hard lines in a topic that's a lot more fluid than that.  Truth be told, TGI has much more Hardcore influence than 90% of the stuff that's posted in /r/metalcore, so it gets redirected here.  They're probably best defined as a mix of the two, but there isn't a sub for that.  I would argue that BAAO's first album really did fit in this sub, but the newer one definitely would fit in /r/posthardcore better, yet once again no sub caters to bands that are sorta 50/50. If it's getting voted to the front page, though, I don't see a problem."

Bands that go into that really deep death metal type growl are usually an immediate skip for me.  I highly recommend Defeater if you haven't heard them yet.  I found myself quickly becoming obsessed with their music because of the storyline told between the songs.  Each album puts you into the head of one of the characters so you can understand what they are doing and why they are doing it.  The Red, White and Blues is a good intro to them.  It introduces a character from the first album known as the ""prophet in plain clothes"" the night before he is sent off to fight in WW2.  They used to open their live set with this song."
melodichardcore,2lgag2,oTurkeyJerky,1 point,Fri Nov 7 08:55:40 2014 UTC,"Section 1. Musical style and lyrics of article  Defeater %28band%29:       Defeater is a melodic hardcore band who like to take ""creative liberties"" when crafting songs. According to guitarist Jay Maas, ""There's a prevalent thing in this genre where if you're not doing what hardcore bands have been doing for the last 25 years almost verbatim, you're fucking up.""  Defeater also showed their softer side with the four acoustic tracks at the end of their second studio album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights.  Lyrically, Defeater is a concept band. All of their music serves as narration over one overarching story, telling of the struggles of a working class New Jersey family in the Post-World War II Era. Vocalist Derek Archambault stated in a 2009 interview that all of Defeater's work would take place within this story.   Their debut album, Travels, established the story and characters. Travels tells of a younger brother, born to an abusive father and innocent older brother and addict mother, he runs away from home and becomes a drifter after killing his father in a fight, later to return and face redemption. The Lost Ground (EP) tells the story of the ""Prophet in Plain Clothes,"" a homeless street performer whose song inspires the protagonist of Travels to stop running from his past and problems. Lost Ground reveals the Prophet's past, an African American World War II veteran that returns home only to be shunned for the color of his skin. Hopeless, he becomes an alcoholic train hopper and street performer, singing of his struggles in order to survive. Empty Days & Sleepless Nights returns to the New Jersey family, this time centered around the older brother of the protagonist of Travels, who spends his life waiting to get revenge on his younger brother for murdering their father. Letters Home features the life of the father of the family.

Don't get me wrong, I love them. But I discovered them with Fury And The Fallen Ones and was like ""these guys have the best breakdowns out of any band"". The Returners came out and it was absolutely perfect, better production, breakdowns of the CENTURY with Overlooked (my opinion lol). I think I actually might like that album the most, it was the perfect blend, still as angry as the first, but just improved.  Get What You Give was also a step forward with the clean singing that I love, but there are probably a couple songs that I could do without. (and despite this, still obviously a Top 5 album of that year for me), but this album, I don't know - none of the singles excited me, and I dig the lyrics and what not, but there's something that just hasn't satisfied me with it. Cliche, but I've known TGI for always having the best breakdowns in music for me - a perfect blend of hardcore and metalcore. I feel like they're getting more hardcore than metalcore lately though.

It's a bit different but I actually think it's slightly better than their previous ones, never thought I would be able to say that, but I'm truly amazed by this. I couldn't find any bad song. Jeremy McKinnon and Jason Butler did great in the songs they were involved in.  Such an amazing job on the lyrics, you can really feel it. They worked their asses off to make this album great. I heard about this around one year ago and they've worked hard for this. I hope we'll see Jeremy in every album they're going to produce in the future. He's been so important for them.  To end this small ""review"", here's my rating for every song:  Avalanche - 8/10  Move Me - 7/10  Out Of Control - 8/10  With The Wolves - 7/10  Mercy - 9.5/10  Phoenix Flame 9/10  Dear Youth (Day 52) - 9/10  Wide Eyed - 9/10  My Endnote - 7/10  The Other Half - 8/10  Blank Pages - 8.5/10  Overall rating:   8.5/10  This album saved my year."

melodichardcore,2le754,sanitysshadow,1 point,Thu Nov 6 10:22:52 2014 UTC,I'll have to give it more of a listen but holy crap what is with this trend of making the Snare so god damn loud? It's really frustrating cause I can hear there might be some cool guitar stuff going on but instead the snare is front and center. This was clearly a conscious choice too as Andrew Wade has engineered plenty of great sounding albums before
melodichardcore,2le754,bodowned,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:06:57 2014 UTC,"I've noticed that as well. It's like they're trying to take that punch that sounds really good on the kick drum but they're putting it all over the kit, and especially the snare."

melodichardcore,2l86ln,ajchxc,0,Tue Nov 4 14:42:01 2014 UTC,"God that video is awful.  I think the cameraman had a stroke while filming it.  This band is really sick though.  The lyrics come off as corny sometimes, but the singer is 100% genuine and seems like a really nice guy who is just trying to push out a positive message about overcoming addiction and depression and stuff.  EDIT: Oh and the drummer really abuses that fast pattern that starts at 0:07.  It feels like that same pattern is in all of their songs and gets a little repetitive.  These are all different songs, mostly from the same album (Cycles).  Cycles, Outdated, Appraisals and Ommissions, Not My Salvation, Legacy.  I'm sure they are all slightly different, but they sound too similar to me."

However the crowd reacted better than to other opening acts I've seen (e.g. Secrets which was the opening act for Asking Alexandria, The Ghost Inside, Crown the Empire) but they were definitely better than Wovenwar (basically old As I lay Dying)."

I'm seeing them live in a week so I can get back to you on how good it is live if you want?"

Its obvious you have production behind studio recordings and its not really natural most of the time. Look at this:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlVF5CpVKWM  I doubt he could do these high notes like this live, but it still sounds somewhat natural and ""real"". What bugs me about ""nobody"" is that it doesnt sound natural at all, it sounds fake and I just dont get why theyd do it like this. Is it lazyness? Or even intentional? Id just like to understand the reason cause I cant come up with a good one to do it this way. Well I hope they dont stick to that (ha!).   And again, Ive seen them live, theyre awesome and really cool and I wont drop them for this."
melodichardcore,2jwd0i,-y0shi-,1 point,Wed Oct 22 16:03:21 2014 UTC,"Holy shit hahaha I didn't know they did a cover of that! Maybe they tuned the vocals like that to fit in with the guitar a little better? They compliment each other almost perfectly, maybe Jesse can't reach the pitch required to match the guitars? I know what you're saying though man, I'm so stoked!"
melodichardcore,2jwd0i,Bojangle_your_wangle,2,Wed Oct 22 16:07:11 2014 UTC,"Like I said, I didnt mind it on the cover because it still sounds natural, and maybe he can actually sing that. I know that bands downtune to ease the burden on their singer, e.g. The Gaslight Anthem play in D-Standart which is really weird for their kind of music. It just sticks out so badly on the new song, that bothers me, I have a hard time looking past it.   We're really lucky here in Germany, thanks to impericon theyre here all the time, Ive seen them 3 times in the last 18 months?"
melodichardcore,2jwd0i,-y0shi-,2,Wed Oct 22 17:05:56 2014 UTC,"Two times this summer for me, they're all over. The Never Say Die! Tour will be the third time within only five months. I really can't wait how Nobody will do live."

And yeah, I noticed that when I looked at the NSD! history page, but other than STYG I haven't seen any of the bands live yet. Gonna be nice seeing Comeback Kid on their run for Die Knowing, I love that album."

I saw CBK on their birthday tour with scott in cologne, that was a really special show to me. I never got into die knowing, I love almost all of their stuff but die knowing seems dumbed down, idk. What songs do you like? Maybe Ill give it another shot. Also if you like CBK check out this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt_cSkOdACc"

Wish I could've catched the set of Hundredth, but it just didn't fit because Polar and them were overlapping.  As for CBK, I really can't get into the albums pre-Symptoms + Cures. And Die Knowing is just so full of energy and awesome hooks, especially Didn't Even Mind. If you dig any of S+C, you gotta check that song out.  And thanks for the link, will take a look soon. :)"

It's cool listening to it again from that perspective."

Almost all of my recent music discoveries have been from no-name local bands on reddit. Leave the ""mainstream"" write ups to big publications. If I want to read about La Dispute, I'll likely go to a bigger publication. Small bands with good music need people/blogs to represent them."

melodichardcore,2j2aww,lauucken,3,Mon Oct 13 04:40:12 2014 UTC,"If you didn't know already, all of Defeater's music is telling out the story of a really tragic family in the 1950's.  It's interesting because some songs are retelling the same story, but from a slightly different perspective and each song adds a little more to the storyline of the family.  This song is about the elder brother meeting his wife at the local bar and falling in love with her.  I Don't Mind is the same story, but with a little more detail.   Blessed Burden the first track on their first album is a fantastic intro to the family, and it's partner song is But Breathing, and maybe Bastards from the father's perspective. Everything Went Quiet and Brothers. Cemetery Walls and Headstone Forgiver Forgetter and Warm Blood Rush Debts and White Oak Doors   The songs that don't have matching songs are good too, they just fill in the life story of each character.  Like I said, Defeater is really fucking good at what they do and I can't wait for them to start touring again."

melodichardcore,2j2aww,lauucken,1 point,Mon Oct 13 06:57:44 2014 UTC,"I'm very glad I came across this band, they're really impressive. This song in particular has a great feel and flow where up until the last 45 seconds everything is spacey and melodic but still heavy, then fills out and ends with the built up momentum of the song. To tie in two completely unrelated genres it reminds me of In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins or Puppets by Atmosphere. I'm looking forward to getting to know these guys more."

melodichardcore,2hvo23,the_drowned_man,-1,Tue Sep 30 13:14:08 2014 UTC,"Despite what many people here think, this doesn't constitute hardcore. It's trendy post-hardcore. It seems I am in the minority but I would be much happier if bands like this stopped popping up in this subreddit."
melodichardcore,2hvo23,bojank33,1 point,Wed Oct 1 04:18:49 2014 UTC,What makes you say this? How are they not hardcore?
melodichardcore,2hvo23,theblehlife,-2,Wed Oct 1 21:16:51 2014 UTC,"Because they aren't a hardcore band. It's as simple as that. Here is a post of mine that should outline what melodic hardcore and hardcore in general really is. A lot of people think hardcore is a broad term that means anything heavy that isn't metal, especially in this subreddit. But that is incorrect. Hardcore is a very specific genre, it is a derivative of punk. It is meant to be fast, abrasive, and in your face. Sometimes its melodic, hence melodic hardcore and sometimes its quite heavy, but never as heavy as metal. The vocals are shouted not screamed or growled, the guitars are rarely downtuned more than a step, it rarely has breakdowns, and most of the time it sounds closer to punk than metal, at the most it will sound like an even mix of the two. The song posted here is none of that. It's slow, has several breakdowns, contains growled vocals, its far too calming, and sounds nothing like punk. This song should be considered post-hardcore, a genre that splintered off of hardcore in the mid to late nineties and over time left the all important punk influence behind. Thus it was no longer hardcore and as a result doesn't belong here if we are going to be true to our subreddit's name."
melodichardcore,2hvo23,bojank33,0,Thu Oct 2 01:43:11 2014 UTC,"I agree with you 100%. Another thing, apart from them not being the correct genre, don't forget that they aren't very good anyway."

melodichardcore,2g6hme,WhiteSoxG7,19,Fri Sep 12 06:43:46 2014 UTC,"To start with you should check out Have Heart. They broke up in '09, but they are regarded as one of the best hardcore bands in years for a reason. Both of their albums are amazing but if you're looking for a more melodic sound go with Songs to Scream at the Sun. Listen to the whole album, it's barely twenty minutes long. The Things They Carry is heavier and has more of a traditional sound for hardcore, though it's still catchy as shit.   After you've fallen in love with Have Heart you need to know where it comes from, so check out these three.  Comeback Kid- Wake the Dead  Bane- Can We Start Again  Shai Hulud-  My Heart Bleeds the Darkest Blood  These next two are my favorite songs from two classic bands from the time I got into hardcore in the mid to late 2000's  Verse- The New Fury  Champion- Promises Kept  So, I've shown you the bands that got me into hardcore. Now, these next three are all very popular current acts that I also like. A lot of people coming from metalcore in recent years cite them as the bands that got them into hardcore.  Defeater- The Red, White, and Blues As of right now this is my favorite song on the list besides the Have Heart album I recommended.  Hundreth- Carry On  Counterparts- Jumping Ship   I hope that helps. Just a PSA, all of those bands are hardcore through and through, so they're not going to be as heavy or generally as catchy as either of those bands you mentioned. Hardcore places much less emphasis on those elements when compared to metalcore.   On a closing note you should also check out Terror, Foundation, and Backtrack. They're not melodic hardcore but they're still three of my favorite hardcore bands these days."

Normally I'd rattle off a long winded list, but as far as melodic metal core goes, the previous comments are pretty concise. I will toss these out there though;  More Than Life, Carpathian, Dead Swans, Modern Life Is War, Life Long Tragedy, Dead Hearts."

Alexisonfire - Pulmonary Archery (They're post-hardcore past this album, but this album has a lot of melodic hardcore elements.)  Pianos Become The Teeth - I'll Be Damned  mewithoutYou - January 1979 Their newest stuff is more indie sounding, but the first two albums are very much spoken word style hardcore.  Capsize - This Song Made Me Think Of You"

Kinda-sorta close to melodic hardcore:   Poison the Well.  I like everything they've done, though I wasn't crazy about their last album.  Most people would recommend The Opposite of December and Tear From the Red, though I prefer Versions to the latter album. Shai Hulud - A Profound Hatred of Man and Misanthropy Pure are my go-to albums from these guys.   More Metalcore-y / Mathcore-y:   Converge - Everything from Jane Doe forward, including You Fail Me, No Heroes, Axe to Fall and All We Love We Leave Behind. The Dillinger Escape Plan - Pretty much solid all around.  They seemed a little more 'mathy' on their first album, though their current singer (who's been with them from their second album forward) has way better clean vocals than the first.  Not quite as manic a screamer, but still quite good. Genghis Tron - I'm not quite sure where these guys go, to be honest, but I just like recommending them to people."

melodichardcore,2ftim9,yourmindsdecide,4,Mon Sep 8 17:54:43 2014 UTC,"The drums (mostly the snare) are too dense and forward.  They drown out the guitars a little bit, so they've (the guitars) lost that bit of aggressiveness that they had on Get What You Give.    An example is the breakdown at 2:54.  Imagine that with the guitar tones on Get What You Give.  It would sound way punchier and really hit you as a listener.  It's not a bad mix by any means though. Just my two cents."
melodichardcore,2ftim9,GOML_OnMyLevel,1 point,Tue Sep 9 04:19:30 2014 UTC,Completely agree with this. Toss on a Get What You Give song right after this and you immediately hear the difference in guitar tone and mixing. The guitars take a back seat to the drums (snare) in this song.

No matter where I rest my head for the night, you're resting in my mind.  When no one else would listen your attention was consistent. I just want to hold onto the best thing to fucking happen to me. Maybe this is more than you asked for, Maybe this is more than I can handle. I can't remember the last time that I held on so tightly.  Maybe look a little closer. You'll see the change I want you to see in me. Maybe wait a little longer. You'll see the person you're wanting me to be. Just wait for me, I can be who you want me to be. Please wait for me.  Just promise me if I fall back asleep, you'll be there when my eyes open.  To be clear on what I'm saying, I just hate to keep you waiting, but nothing is changing for now.

melodichardcore,2dcwws,satan-says-meow,3,Tue Aug 12 19:16:20 2014 UTC,"I loved Dear G-d and hoped that HWBWP would be somewhat more similar.  Picking up the guitarist from The Elijah and the drummer from Sleep Patterns I thought would make it heavier if anything, but when I first put it in and listened to it all the way through, it honestly felt like ""pop hardcore.""    I've come around to liking it a bit more now, but I had to accept that Being As An Ocean is a different band now."

I use a 2X10 Acoustic-brand bass amp and it works great for me. Just the SansAmp box and a tuner going through my amp and I'm personally good to go  Here's the SansAmp Bass Driver: http://www.tech21nyc.com/products/sansamp/bassdriverdi.html

First time in June, they were talking to the crowd a lot like ""fucking move"" and all that stuff.  Second time in July they went all preachy with speeches in between the songs aboit how you should be yourself. I actually thought that was better, as it had a more personal feel.  They got the crowd going pretty hard both times though, and the actual performance was absolutely awesome. I'd see them again if I had the chance. Hope you have fun. :)"

melodichardcore,2cq1qh,shortbusoneohone,3,Tue Aug 5 20:46:48 2014 UTC,Not really sure how to answer this but you can usually come up with some cool stuff by playing around with power chords and changing up the highest note so like instead of an 8-8-8 power chord you could do like 8-8-10 or 8-8-7 and if you're in standard tuning then things like 5-7-6 or 8-7-9
melodichardcore,2cq1qh,Informalmoose3,3,Wed Aug 6 00:30:55 2014 UTC,"Exactly what I do. I find the root power chord, but then try out other notes on the higher strings to see what works and sounds cool."
melodichardcore,2cq1qh,PowerRangersFreak,2,Wed Aug 6 00:43:36 2014 UTC,"The 8-8-10 (in Drop tuning), what's it called? I've seen it countless times in Melodic Hardocre/Metalcore and I never know how to call it."
melodichardcore,2cq1qh,PowerRangersFreak,1 point,Wed Aug 6 00:49:54 2014 UTC,"For the 5-7-6 chord you mentioned for standard tuning, I like to use this instead:   E||------|  B||------|  G||--4--|  D||--6--|  A||--7--|  E||--5--|   It's a fun little chord, but I've been stuck in a rut with guitar lately. All I can do is find cool chords that I don't know what to do with."
melodichardcore,2cq1qh,PowerRangersFreak,2,Wed Aug 6 03:01:48 2014 UTC,"I always use chords like:  C||---------------------------------|   G||---------------------------------|                         E||---------------------------------|     B||--0---2---3---5---7----8---10----|   F||--1---3---5---7---8---10---12----|   B||---------------------------------|   I use Drop B in this tab cause it's my preffered tuning,  and also that's the Natural Minor scale, the most used scale in Melodic Hardcore/Metalcore.  Now onto progressions, I was going to use Roman numbers for intervals but most people don't know them, and it's too much work for me to figure out the proper ones on each occasion so here are some tabs. (Considering B is your root note)  C||----------------|   G||----------------|                         E||----------------|     B||--7---7---5---3-|   F||--8---8---7---5-|  Play around with this for a while and then: B||----------------|  C||----------------|   G||----------------|                         E||----------------|     B||--3---3---5---7-|  at this point I switch to regular power chords for variety but F||--1---1---3---5-|   you can use the weird chords I listed above if you feel like it B||----------------|   You can also add an open (low) B at each chord because it is the root note and it sounds right with all the above.      That's my most used progression, I can list a different one in a similar fashion if anyone is interested."
melodichardcore,2cq1qh,Tickle_Me_Elmo,1 point,Wed Aug 6 01:05:31 2014 UTC,"Nice! I love those chords. They're reminiscent of Blink for me. I like to use this chord in standard.   E||------|  B||------|  G||------|  D||--4--|  A||--2--|  E||--2--|   You can use this shape as a substitute for heavier stuff in standard tuning. This functions basically as a quartal voicing, stacked fourths -- so, it sounds extra mean. It sounds best if you do mostly chromatic stuff in the bass.   E||-----------------------|  B||-----------------------|  G||------2---------------|  D||--4---4---5---4---3--|  A||--2---2---3---2---1--|  E||--2---0---3---2---1--|   I like this little progression."

melodichardcore,29qxmb,themightypooperscoop,2,Thu Jul 3 16:13:13 2014 UTC,I was so sad when they broke up. I never got to see them live. These guys are the reason I started playing hardcore music in my early teens.
melodichardcore,29qxmb,StarDamage,2,Thu Jul 3 16:37:44 2014 UTC,One of my all time favourite ep's. The musicianship on this album is ridiculous.
melodichardcore,29r6eo,sheldonhuk,7,Thu Jul 3 17:09:01 2014 UTC,"No, but it's a great record."
melodichardcore,29r6eo,LeStephenHawking,2,Fri Jul 4 16:18:03 2014 UTC,"It was remixed by Jay Mass (defeater, have heart) and he basically just cleaned up the recording quality. I'm surprised you can't tell a difference. Listen to Unlovable old and new back to back. The new one is much cleaner and way less harsh on the ears. The first release was very harsh and nasty sounding. If you aren't listening on decent headphones or speakers it might be hard to tell."
melodichardcore,29r6eo,yammyham,1 point,Sun Aug 10 16:56:30 2014 UTC,I think I'll give it a second listen with my headphones then because my speakers are pretty shitty. Thanks dude!

EDIT: The melodimosh stuff is getting to be a bit trite, I swear I have heard this song a hundred times done by better bands. It sounds good as far as quality is concerned, but it just sounds like more bargain bin melodimosh to me. Nothing stands out about this song aside from the painfully predictable chugga-chugga breaking into a pop chorus."

melodichardcore,27ivx8,SGDrummer7,3,Sat Jun 7 03:16:47 2014 UTC,Cool song! I'm a fan of both Counterparts and Worthwhile and can definitely hear the similarity to both of those bands.
melodichardcore,27ivx8,Sam_Son_of_Sam,2,Sat Jun 7 06:48:29 2014 UTC,Nice. I can hear the Counterparts influence :)
melodichardcore,27ivx8,allaboutandroids,4,Sat Jun 7 03:19:30 2014 UTC,Lately I've noticed that Melodic Hardcore bands have the habit of getting their band names from other bands' song names even more so than metalcore ones do

Goodtime Boys - Rain   Again great vocals from a more unknown band, seriously underrated and great melodies, almost like Gnarwolves but heavier.   Capsize - I've Been Tearing Myself Apart EP   Capsize are one of my favorite bands so anything they release is at the top for me, although this is a very short EP it still packs a wicked sound.  And I agree with you on Hundredth, such a sick album!"

From the new album they have been playing witness, wither, slave, outlier and debris recently. They started ending with compass instead of disconnect (they still play it) which is pretty rad. They usually sprinkle in refection or i am no one and if you're lucky they may play only anchors but they may have retired all the prophets' stuff. Have fun"
melodichardcore,2707s1,ericmscher,1 point,Sun Jun 1 03:43:03 2014 UTC,I saw them recently and the setlist was:  Witness  Debris   Slave  Oulier  Wither  Reflection  The Disconnect  I Am No One  Compass  And then they usually throw in Only Anchors or (You Think You're) John Fucking Locke

Their new material certainly leans towards that."

Their instrumentals are essentially the same as every other melodic hxc band out there. Honestly to me they are a melodic hxc band with a large emphasis on clean vocals instead of harsh.

They definitely went for a new direction lyrically and they improved their sound. Especially Euclid (Slave Song) off of Revolt and Resist off of Resist are my jams.  The one song off their old album that they'll most definitely play is Weathered Town, it's a fan favourite.  Edit: For other bands, be sure to check out Polar. They went on tour with Hundredth, BAAO and Counterparts in February and even though their new album is my album of the year so far, they're still not very well-known."

I personally think the new clean vocalist still brings raw emotion to the lyrics, but I feel like the lead singer did a well enough job on the first album.

But after a couple more listens and the album really grew on me. now i cant stop listening to it. the melodies and drumming are great and i love all of joels spoken word parts through it. definitely cant wait for my preorder to get here!"
melodichardcore,24eadx,Janaar,1 point,Fri May 2 01:28:01 2014 UTC,"Not a big fan of the slow part that comes after the intro (which was bangin and seemed to be about to bring up an even heavier part imo, so a bit of a let down). But otherwise, really solid track. It got me way more excited for the upcoming album than the last song did."
melodichardcore,24eadx,Fenix40,-3,Wed Apr 30 22:12:52 2014 UTC,"Sounds exactly like previous BAAO pretentious, boring, and not worth the praise they get at all"
