HBOGameofThrones,3dywkm,guaranic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:25 2015 UTC,I can't even find the one on the official channels. I looked on HBO's YT channel and GOT's YT channel. I even did it in the channel search bar and still couldn't find it. And the one's that are in 720p on YT you can easily tell they ripped it. So it's a compressed video that got compressed again.

HBOGameofThrones,3du93n,Strix121,13,Sun Jul 19 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"I  felt like this season, more than any other season, was made more as a ""shocking spectacle for TV"" than a fantasy story.   Never before have there been so many multi-episode buildups,  teasers and cliffhangers,  and shocking scenes for the sake of shock. I think D&D have discovered and settled into a formula that gets ratings and makes for good watercooler chat,  but deviates from what made the show so good in the previous 4 seasons.   For example,  the Sansa/Ramsey scene,  the Shireen scene,  the Cersi walk of shame scene (10 minutes was a bit too long), the fighting pit/dragon scene, and Jon Snow's big scene.  I'm being vague to avoid spoilers.   I'm not the first to say it but Dorne was disappointing and mostly silly. I'll just leave it at that. No need to beat a dead horse.   Im very bored with Dany's story.  Who gives a shit about her struggles with governing a different culture. We've been watching that crap for 3 seasons now.  ""Should there or should there not be fighting pits?"" is not a story that should occupy a major character for more than 10 episodes. How did we go from a War of Five Kings for the Iron Throne to debating cultural conflicts. BORRRING!   Hardhome was excellent and exciting, and I'm glad to see that something significant and conclusive finally happened to Stannis.  But other than that,  the vast majority of Season 5 was a series of teases,  shocks,  and spectacle."
HBOGameofThrones,3du93n,elmarko44,4,Sun Jul 19 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here. Dorne was a family sitcom with all the stupid squabbles, and dany has a such a boring story line."
HBOGameofThrones,3du93n,RyanCantDrum,3,Sun Jul 19 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"I remember be extremely excited to finally see and experience Dorne, and then it was all kind of dull. It never had the sense of place I had hoped for."
HBOGameofThrones,3du93n,Coldhandles,3,Sun Jul 19 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority, but on the whole, I found it satisfying - that is to say, I was looking forward to the next episode days before it aired. Yes, Dorne made me cringe a few times, but I also think they have a bigger plan and needed to introduce them into the fold. Highlights: Cersei being brought low right after shaming Margery; obviously Hardhome was badass; Reek/Theon admitting that he did not kill Bran and Rickon- his ""redemption"" thru Myranda, taking off w/ Sansa; anything with Tormund/free folk.  Downside: Waste of good talent on the Jamie/Bronn adventure; the mismanagement of the jailed Tyrells trial; Jorahs greyscale needs to be acknowledged (he touched Dany, could this be a problem?; still waiting on the North to fight back against the Boltons and for the Freys to be repaid.  I had already been spoiled on the last episode, so it was expected but still painful and I really don't think I can watch the show anymore if that was really the end of him. Also hoping Stannis was spared for conflicting reasons."
HBOGameofThrones,3du93n,ShameBell,2,Sun Jul 19 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"not much to say here, i didnt like it at all. books are imo much better and im glad ive read them first instead of watching the Show. the first few seasons were quite good actually, but the more it diverse from the books the less i like it, because no one can compete with martins Vision."

HBOGameofThrones,3dmnib,yobbr18,14,Fri Jul 17 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation, but Joffrey and Myrcella were both murdered by poison, and both by the family of their betrothed. I don't see the Tyrells pulling off another regicide-by-poison, but I could easily see Margery getting killed or put aside as a result of her trial. This would leave Tommen to find a new bride, and I figure that bride's family will poison him.   That, or he'll somehow get hit by crossfire during Cersei's trial-by-combat, like an axe will slip out of someone's hand and go into his skull."
HBOGameofThrones,3dmnib,SharMarali,13,Fri Jul 17 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"That bit about the axe....would actually be awesome. No one would be expecting it in the moment. Total shock to viewers and characters, and who knows who they'll put on the throne."

HBOGameofThrones,3dmnib,SharMarali,3,Fri Jul 17 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"Unless we get a lot more character development from Tommen, I am thinking it will be something quick and relatively painless, like Myrcella. We don't hate him enough for it to be something that he really suffers through (and he is like a baby in the books so that would be messed up).   Tommen isn't put in very many compromising positions, so it would have to be something sneaky or a weird ""accident"" of sorts."
HBOGameofThrones,3dmnib,er40,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking he will be killed by another of the great families during a coup.  Dragon fire from Daenerys, or maybe Littlefinger has some cruel fate up his sleeve for when King's Landing is at its most defenseless after Cersei has her revenge on the Sparrows?  Maybe he will be flayed alive by Ramsay?"
HBOGameofThrones,3dmnib,genericdude999,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the last we heard of Tommen he had locked himself in his chambers and was refusing food. I predict suicide- it is a cowardly move, and that's how they've been hyping him the whole time. His wife is still in prison, his mother was just humiliated, and he believes he's helpless to save them. Not to mention, poor Ser Pounce is nowhere to be found. I think we'll see him swinging in the first few episodes. Hope I'm wrong."

HBOGameofThrones,3datpk,GameofTitties,2,Tue Jul 14 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"I noticed this as well! This is pure speculation but taking into consideration that nothing on this show is done by accident, it's reasonable to assume these subtle changes MAY have meaning and were not just a coincidence of color grading.  I think the darkening of their hair reflects the development of their characters. For Sansa, the darkening of her hair could reflect the loss of her innocence, naivety and softness. For Mel it could reflect her ever deepening obsession with power and the evil means she uses attempting to obtain it. It's the minor details that go into this show that makes it such a winner."
HBOGameofThrones,3datpk,lady_penn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"With Mel I was wondering if it was a sign that maybe she is not on the right side, i.e. I wonder if it turns out that she is in fact working for the Other rather than Rh'llor without noticing it. I think it's interesting how Rh'llor is the god of light/fire/and all things good but somehow shadows are a part of him as well (the shadow babies she births) yet what does that leave for the darkness of the Others?"
HBOGameofThrones,3datpk,E-Nezzer,2,Sun Jul 19 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, Melisandre. I thought her hair seemed much brighter when you first see her on Dragonstone, and at the wall her hair seems to be much darker. She says that she has more power at the wall, but she seems to be much darker, her hair is almost brown/black at the wall.   Here are some links to footage as my evidence:  Season 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1OpEwhEMdc  Season 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9Zg6M-wFc  This may be something minor, like the production team running out of Red #5 hair dye, but I just found it interesting how she went from a bright bright red color to an almost purple/black red color, and I wondered if anyone else noticed or thought it could be significant."
HBOGameofThrones,3datpk,Ceane,7,Tue Jul 14 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"Carice van Houten said somewhere she uses the same wig since season 2. It's just that during post-production they give certain places a different tint, mostly to create a sense of temperature. Scenes in the North or at the Wall tend to look more colorless, while in the South or Essos they are more colorful. Both Mel and Sansa moved from the South to the North, so we see the a fainter shade of red in their hair."
HBOGameofThrones,3datpk,rbrtcnnll,2,Wed Jul 15 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"What /u/E-Nezzer said. This is also evident when you look at her dress in a photo from the costume department, versus a shot of her wearing it in the show. There's a lot of detail you can't see due to the colour grading."

HBOGameofThrones,3d8b1e,invz27,6,Tue Jul 14 08:01:52 2015 UTC,I cant think of anything too specific. Mostly just quotes foreshadowing future events. In a big picture sense you really get the feeling that every single little thing that happened in se1 some how plays a huge part in later seasons. I enjoy noticing these little decisions and how they affect what you already know is going to happen.
HBOGameofThrones,3d8b1e,crocbot1,5,Tue Jul 14 10:00:15 2015 UTC,"Also just started over again with a new girlfriend.  Only on episode 2, but a few things stood out that I didn't notice the first time around, or forgot:  1)  Daenerys always seemed small and weak in the early episodes.  Knowing what happens, it's pretty obvious that this is not the case.  2) When Jon meets Jaime, they shake hands, and the focus is entirely on Jaime's right hand.  And their conversation surrounds swordplay and fighting. Pretty obvious foreshadowing for him losing his hand.  3). Jaime is a DICK.  I forgot how much I hated his character at the beginning.  Smug, incestuous child murderer.  Yet he becomes one of my favorites."
HBOGameofThrones,3d8b1e,Silent--H,3,Tue Jul 14 13:21:15 2015 UTC,Dany still is small and weak. She relies on her advisors because she pretty much fucks everything up when she's acting alone.   If it wasn't for her Unsullied and the dragons she'd be long gone by now - We've never seen her fight or anything.
HBOGameofThrones,3d8b1e,255255255noise,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"LOL - I thought the same thing about Jamie when I was watching ES3 last night!   The thing that's stood out to me the most was when Cersei tells Cat Stark about loosing her ""black"" haired baby to fever. It may have been the kings baby as it wasn't blond. I think she may have killed they baby. Thoughts?"

Pretty jealous since my family did it without me right before I came home for the summer.    But like others have said, pay special attention to what people say. Knowing that some people will never meet again, pay attention to their parting words and feelings towards each other. Or pay attention to how people act if you know a dramatic change is coming their way.    And try to ignore the changing wigs. Each time I see S1 Tyrion's hair I am completely shocked."

Pretty much all of the characters are written so that you seen the good and evil in all of them.   So far,  white walkers have been portrayed as the bad guys, but the most recent season did show us that there is hierarchy and a goal that they are working towards, even if we don't know what that is yet.   It makes sense that we might gain some insight on that.    I think you are reading into the deader than dead too much...  It's an expression and could be applied to him just being actually dead.

GRRM has tried to show in the books that people are not the same when they come back. I think that he will come back but it would not be the Jon Snow that we have known. Exactly what that means, I don't know. I don't think that he would go with the White Walkers though.   I just can't see Jon Snow being dead and that's the end of it. His parentage hasn't been addressed but that's a big thing, right? So why would that question linger when he's dead? I just think that his death releases him from the vows of the watch. Melisandre saw a power in him. Why would she say that and then he's dead and we don't find out what the power it is that she saw?  He's coming back. He will be changed.

HBOGameofThrones,3catye,Tarygaryen,30,Mon Jul 6 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"I liked him from the beginning to the end, he was extremely clever, ruthless, just generally brilliant.  Even when he allowed Tyrion to be accused, and allowed Cersei to conduct that farce of a trial, he had his reasons. I don't believe he did it because he hated Tyrion, he probably took joy from it for that reason, but he wouldn't do that just because he hated Tyrion. Up until the trial, Tyrion was promised Winterfell, Tywin clearly meant to genuinely give it to Tyrion; Tywin had no plans to get rid of Tyrion.  Tywin allowed all of that to happen because he knew what would happen if they actually investigated Joffrey's death. He knew it wasn't Tyrion, that much was obvious, it was highly unlikely it was Sansa. That basically left the Tyrells with a good motive, or possibly the Martells (what with Oberyn the poison-expert turning up the week before). Tywin realised that if they investigated, then they might find who actually killed Joffrey and it wouldn't be someone as easy and convenient as Tyrion. If they discovered it was the Tyrells or the Martells, then that would force a war, something neither the realm nor the Lannisters could afford. So, Tywin allowed Tyrion to be blamed and found guilty, thus avoiding any actual investigating that might lead to a much less convenient truth."
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,tantan628,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:42:11 2015 UTC,I would think he could figure out other people to frame without taking out a Lannister.  I think the main reason was the he knew that at that point there was no way Cersei and Tyrion could coexist.  That was a bigger threat to the family than losing Tyrion.
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,GracchiBros,2,Tue Jul 7 21:22:56 2015 UTC,"They could easily coexist, in fact Tywin had a plan for exactly how that would have worked, it involved marrying Cersei and sending her as far south as he could, while sending Tyrion as far north as he could."

HBOGameofThrones,3catye,Bilbosnaggers,11,Tue Jul 14 06:59:17 2015 UTC,"I would say that I respect Tywin as a powerful, smart, and effective leader. He's second to none in the series on those qualities.  However, he's arguably the most evil and deplorable character. He benefits by acting through others to commit these deeds and never himself, thus giving himself a nicer image as a leader and not a butcher (ironic considering his first scene in the series is him butchering a animal).  Even despite this, he's a man of logic and principle. He doesn't make rash decisions (unlike his children). Every action he takes is very calculated and precise to achieve an intended purpose.  His only flaw was pissing off his younger son."

HBOGameofThrones,3catye,dbutlerjr,5,Mon Jul 6 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"He was a complex villain you love to hate.  His scenes with Arya were good in S2 and he was quite brilliant and machiavellian in his schemes.  He was not a ""nice"" person"" per se and was especially cruel towards Tyrion, which ultimately bit him in the a**.  He wasn't outwardly evil or sadistic like Joffrey though his seemingly principled and pleasant demeanor makes you sometimes almost forget that he helped orchestrate atrocities like The Red Wedding and, even more importantly, the genocide of House Reynes of Castamere, which we don't see on-screen but know what happened."
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,micoleslaw,10,Mon Jul 6 21:50:40 2015 UTC,"I would say I liked him to the very end.   A man does not keep his position by putting his children first.  He was arguably the most powerful man in the realm, and his legacy is everything for his family to keep that power.   I suppose his legacy is the promise that it wouldn't all be for nothing and that his deeds were remembered."
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,strangely-wise,3,Mon Jul 6 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"I liked him, and when Arya was serving him I really liked him, and disliked him at the same time. But his smarts and wit when speaking with Arya were fun."
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,manubfr,6,Mon Jul 6 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"Tywin was one of the best characters on the show. Credit to Charles Dance for making him a figure of authority that intense. Favourite scene is one of the small council when they learn about the Red Wedding. Tywin says nothing for the whole scene, eventually things geth heated and Joffrey yells ""I am the King"".   Tywin: ""Anyone who must say ""I am the King"" is no true King""   End of discussion!"
HBOGameofThrones,3catye,i_am_c_dog,3,Tue Jul 7 10:36:01 2015 UTC,He was a man of principle and you ahve to respect that. He wouldn't let anyone soil the family name including his own children.

HBOGameofThrones,3bqb8b,mama-cass,16,Wed Jul 1 07:52:28 2015 UTC,1) I don't believe its the same faceless man.  2) Arya is acting out of revenge instead of the death being an offering to the many faced god. Its a selfish act.  3) Arya Stark took the life. If a faceless man does it then no one has killed them and it is a offering to the many faced god.
HBOGameofThrones,3bqb8b,Ender8613,8,Wed Jul 1 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"He told her that she could do those things, but he didn't mean like, tomorrow. It's like how Bran was told that he can fly. I don't think anyone's expecting him to take off next week; he's got a lot of training to do first.   Arya took a face without permission, without completing her training, and without telling anyone what she was doing.   She's also supposed to be learning to be No One, and she simply isn't allowed to go around becoming Arya again whenever it suits her fancy.  So she did a lot of things wrong here, but basically it all boils down to her being impudent."
HBOGameofThrones,3bqb8b,SharMarali,2,Wed Jul 1 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"So if Arya instead not taking a face but, hypothetically, had a wig or something to alter her appearance that wasn't a face that belonged to Jaqen and instead killed Meryn as ""Arya Stark with a wig on"" would she not have been punished in the end?

In reality LF did very little to keep House Aryn out of the war of the five kings. At the same time he did almost nothing to get them to join, he was just there planning and improving his hand.  The main thing that kept House Aryn and the knights of the Vale out of the war was Lysa Aryns's extreme isolationism and paranoia about losing Robin. Lysa is not mentally well, it's her defining characteristic in the show. Her motivation is much simpler than almost anyone else in Westeros: keep Robin safe. She lost her husband at the capital and now she see's almost everyone ( including her sister on her visit to the Vale) as a threat to her son.  So, if you were a paranoid and mentally ill mother who happened to own one of the best fortified castles in the world what would you do? The answer is nothing. The Aryns, who lead the Vale, isolated themselves and ordered a vast number of knights to their future kings protection. Entering the war held no benefit to them as Lysa is loyal only to her son."

Her slave liberation will be long forgotten in the wake of her brutal, merciless tyrannical wrath.   -Stannis is dead.   People argue that Stannis isn't dead because the show ""always shows the actual beheading"". However, we didn't literally see Ned Stark's head get severed. I think that for important characters central to the story, they don't necessarily show the slice.  -Tyrion will die a heroes death and be remembered as one of the most courageous and important figures in Westerosi history.  -The Hound and Breanne will becomes lovers  -Petyr Baelish will prove to be good-hearted under his cloak of mystery and deception  -Arya will abandon her hitlist after coming to the realization that there is nothing she can do to change the terrible past. She will end up a Lordess of Winterfell.    -Jon Snow is really fucking dead (pains me to say it).   -Cersei and Jamie will end up isolated from society, with no one but each other.

HBOGameofThrones,3azimf,AaronRamsay,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:30:33 2015 UTC,"Mine is much more idealistic and won't come true because George Argh Argh Martin likes to play with my emotions and I would fight him if I ever met him.  Stannis' death or King's blood is what Melisandre uses to revive Jon Snow. With his first death, his watch has ended and frees his obligation to watch bringing him metaphorically from night to light.  Appropriately with Drogon returning to the Dothraki sea with Daenarys confronted by Drogo's old khalsar, the Dothraki see Daenarys and her Dragon as the Stallion that mounts the world and follows her to Meereen where the city is probably under siege or something. With Drogon and Dothraki, Daenarys lifts the attack from the slaving cities joins them to her army. Having her mercenaries, unsullied infantry, dothraki calvary, and siege dragons she just needs ships to Westeros. When she comes to Westeros she'll land on Dragonstone where she was born and begin her campaign there.   Sansa makes it to Petyr somehow with Reek. Upon hearing about what Ramsay had done to her, Petyr launches an invasion into the north to remove the Boltons from power. Theon flays Ramsay and Sansa marries Petyr unifying the Vale and the North. This causes an upheaval brings the Lannisters and the crown in conflict the the Vale and North.   Amongst all this chaos of warring armies between North/Vale, Daenarys' return, Lannisters, and whoever else the wall comes down and the others arrive with their wight army to be met by Daenarys, Jon Snow, and Bran who hopefully wargs a dragon along with the armies of Westeros.   There's some kind of interconnectivity between the last hero, stallion that mounts the world, and the prince that was promised to defeat the others and their wights."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,Tarygaryen,6,Wed Jun 24 12:18:16 2015 UTC,I never thought about that but it makes perfect sense. The show kind of made a point to show how big the Bolton's army was and how shocked Stannis was when he saw all of them. Maybe he realized they defected?
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,optimusrhyme18,3,Wed Jun 24 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that this is actually what happened, although it's not made clear by the show.  But remember Roose Bolton didn't want to fight, he wanted a siege because he knew Stannis had a good sized army that they couldn't face on an open field. Roose wanted a siege so that they would have the defensive advantage to aid them in driving off Stannis. If the Boltons had had this large cavalry force all along, I don't think they would have wanted to force a siege at all."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,tantan628,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"I think the show made it quite clear that is what happened.  In episode 9, Stannis says the guards are either incompetent or working for the Boltons.   Couldn't be much clearer than that."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,lunk,3,Wed Jun 24 19:29:06 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about that, I guess maybe they actually were traitors. But, I don't think so, if they had been, why did they stay? Why not let Ramsay through then leave with him? I mean, he's just burnt all your supplies, and Stannis might realise you're a traitor, why do you stick around?  I thought they were just not used to the northern lands, and Ramsay was, he could have known of some game trails or paths that the watchmen did not."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,tantan628,3,Wed Jun 24 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"I stand by the fact that what happened to Shireen, Is entirely the cause behind it too. He's in such a bubble of his own power fantasy, that he doesn't see the brutality in it anymore. Where as his soldiers, most certainly did... and acted accordingly in my opinion."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,LolFishFail,2,Wed Jun 24 17:03:52 2015 UTC,I think he could have as well. He may have been determined but he wasn't that foolish. Boltons had column after column of heavy Calvary. Stannis made the remark and mercenaries aren't loyal and that panned out. Boltons could have paid them more.
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,nastylep,2,Sat Jun 27 06:07:46 2015 UTC,Seems quite possible.   The way Stannis' army was swallowed up by the Bolton cavalry was eerily reminiscent of how Stannis' army swallowed up the wildlings earlier in the season.
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,arukise,2,Wed Jun 24 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think so too. There was nowhere else to go, Winterfell was the closest place to go for them"
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,nickromas,2,Fri Jun 26 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"You never know, with so many of the northern houses disliking/not fledging allegiance to the Boltons, i cant see any other way how they would have mustered an army so large.   Very good point, although they were mostly sell swords, maybe they got the money from the Lannisters to fund it."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,agryan12,2,Wed Jun 24 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but with I believe the Lannister alliance with the Boltons is over now that Sansa has married Ramsay. I'm not sure how the Boltons came up with the money unless they already had it."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,LolFishFail,2,Thu Jun 25 09:56:43 2015 UTC,"I think it will become clear in the first episode of season 6.  When you see Stannis' cavalry inside Winterfell.    They will all be flayed too, of course.  With Ramsey making a cheeky comment about how they won the battle for them and they didn't even have to pay them for it."
HBOGameofThrones,3ay0k6,Lady-Mormont,2,Fri Jun 26 14:49:03 2015 UTC,"I actually believe a lot of his army deserted after he sacrificed Shireen. We all found it incredibly fucked up, Imagine it from a soldier's perspective. This guy just horrifically dispatched his only child and heir... Imagine how low you as a soldier rank in comparison then.  Nobody would serve someone as brutal as that, unless forced, thus all his sellswords and most of his requested banner-men mutinied or switched sides.  It makes sense to me.

HBOGameofThrones,3awegl,ladatnow,12,Wed Jun 24 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"The mods in this particular sub don't really like book discussions, so I'll keep it brief.  The books contain a ton of insights and hints to what makes the characters tick. You'll have an easy time getting through the first three books, since they match up pretty well with the first four seasons of GoT. You'll know who the majority of the characters are already.  Books 4 and 5 get somewhat fuzzier. Some of the major storylines will be new, and many points were extensively rewritten for the show, so you might be a bit confused now and again.   GRRM really is an amazing writer. He manages to keep every one of his bazillion characters consistent in their actions. Ever wonder why Tyrion popped by to visit his dear old dad on his way to escape from King's Landing? It'll make perfect sense when you read it.  But do try to remember that storytelling has to be done differently for television than for books. Some things look amazing on the page, but have to be cut for budget reasons, screen time reasons, or just plain because it's too confusing to people who only get an hour of story a week. It doesn't make either version better, just different."

Pros: by reading the books you catch some details not shown in the show, and more importantly you feel more intimate to the characters. Reading from their POV makes helps you understand and get to know them better. Also, you gain some more knowledge of the world GRRM created, not to mention that his style of writing makes the reading process very fluent, and you can barely feel the pages going by, very immersive.   Cons: after a while you start to miss seeing something new, yo really miss the element of surprise :/ To me that was satiated by watching season 5, but I know that AFFC already has new stuff for the show, so that pushes me forward. Not exactly a con, but can't not mention it: the books are huge, so be patient."

HBOGameofThrones,3awegl,_TheRooseIsLoose_,2,Wed Jun 24 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"The way I'm dealing with the wait for the next season and book is by reading ""A World of Ice and Fire"" then re-reading the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" books. After all of that, I will re-watch the series.  I feel like it would be really worth it to watch it all over again since I blasted through it the first time by binge-watching it. Since I was a show watcher before I was a book reader, it took some time to figure out all of the names and locations and what the heck was happening in the first season or so. Having a good grasp of all that now, I think things might make more sense the second time around and I might pick up on things I didn't the first time. Same goes with the books. I powered through them since I was reading them at the same time as my mom. Now I'll give myself more time to let it sink in."
HBOGameofThrones,3awegl,maybe_kd,0,Wed Jun 24 10:48:56 2015 UTC,I actually attempted to read years ago and gave up from headaches at attempting to follow all the multitude of characters and locations and stories. The show actually helped straighten out a lot and so I've gone back to the books and will read up by next season starts. I've always been a believer in reading a bood before seeing the show. It always makes the show better because you do have insights into character that the show cannot cover in any real depth. Now if GRRM would get off of his fat ass and finish the series  it would be good.
