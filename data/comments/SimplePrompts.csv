She went on and on about her family and her dreams, but I don't care about anything she has to say. I pulled the trigger, knowing it wasn't loaded. She winced when she heard the click, and she fell when I hit her over the head with the barrel.  I sat down in a chair at the other end of the room and watched her cry in front of me. The only light was bare bulb that hung above her head, swaying ever-so-slightly with the wind that blew through the open windows. Of all the places to die, this had to be the worst; a decrepit old house on the edge of the projects.  She stopped crying and sat up, her eyes desperately searching for any sign of hope; any light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. She found none. What she found was fear. The kind of fear that comes from a primal place deep inside your soul. The kind of fear that stems from the certainty that any moment now your life will be over, and you have no control over the outcome of your current situation.  No doubt she was questioning the choices that led her to this empty house on a cold December night. Maybe she was going over the events that transpired earlier today? Thinking about how I came up behind her with a rag to muffle her screams, as I dragged her to my car and threw her in the trunk like a piece of luggage. Maybe she was thinking about what exactly she could have done that would upset someone enough to do these things to her.  ""You know what you did. You knew damn well what would happen when you made that phone call. Tell me, do you get some kind of satisfaction out of destroying people's lives? Did you wake up that morning thinking you were going to fuck me over, or did you do it spur-of-the-moment style? You could have at least bought me dinner before you fucked me!""  I always managed to find humor in dark situations.  ""I trusted you with my secrets so you could help me, and what do you do? Clearly you didn't know who you were dealing with, because if you did, your stupid ass would be sitting at home talking to your cats instead of being chained to the concrete in an abandoned house, talking to me.""  I got up from my seat and walked over to the table on the far side of the room. On the table lay all types of tools, but I only needed two things: a hammer, and a small piece of metal the size of a toothpick.  She was still begging for to be set free, moaning and crying, as if any of that would help. She pulled away from me as I lightly dragged the cold head of the hammer across her face.  ""I'll make you a deal. If you give me one good reason to let you go, I'll untie you and set you free, no strings attached""  She opened her mouth to give me some bullshit reason why her life mattered even the slightest bit. As she droned on about god-knows-what, I gingerly placed the piece of metal under her toenail, and swung the hammer hard. It made contact and rammed the entire two inch pick into the space between her nail and the skin underneath. She made a sound that reminded me of a whale's song, but higher pitched.  ""Where are your manners? You didn't even say sorry for trying to ruin my life. You haven't even given me any kind of explanation for what you did. You make me sick. I'm going to enjoy the next few days, trust me.""  I raised my gun and pulled the trigger, putting a single round through her shoulder. A light breeze blew through the house and carried the smoke away with it. Her whole body trembled as the blood ran down her chest.  ""Get comfortable honey, I'm just getting started"""

In the position he had chosen, he had about 5 minutes before his knees started to ache, and his quads began to burn with lactic acid. He knew this, but did not dare to stir. If he could manage to fight the pain, he would be home free.    In the bedroom directly above these bushes, Megan stirred slightly. She thought she heard something, a rustle, a slight breath maybe. But she was so close to sleep it barely registered and she drifted off.     It had been 5 minutes, then time crept past to ten minutes. The next five minutes eked by like the slug gradually making its way past John’s adopted bush. But pass they did. Now he was certain the target was asleep. The plan would proceed. Under a small, inconspicuous rock in the garden was a small key. John deftly picked this up and silently opened the front door, pulling the door up and pushing in to remove its weight from the hinges. He kept to the outside of each stair, avoiding the creaky wood in the middle of each stair.     Megan’s eyes snapped open, and narrowed. She thought she had heard something, but wasn’t sure. Looking for comfort, she reached for the pocket knife on her bedside table, and clutched it tightly. Then froze. The moonlight streaming under her door was blocked as though there was someone on just the other side.     John took a deep breath, held it, and whipped open the door. In one motion he jumped from the door to the bed and began to smile.    She was sure there was someone there. After they opened the door and jumped in her direction. Trembling as she was, it was a wonder she managed to get the knife open so quickly, and point it in the right direction, but she did. The 4 inch blade found its way into John’s chest.    John eyes opened wide. He had not seen or heard the knife. He made a small sucking sound with his mouth in surprise, and was dead.   She could feel the knife tear at a slick combination of muscle and sinew. She couldn’t look. But after about 10 seconds, when nothing else happened, she could no longer sit with her eyes clenched, holding up what was quickly becoming dead weight. She slowly turned her head and glanced at the macabre scene just inches from her face. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, they also widened.    “John?” she softly whispered    Her hand began to tremble as the blood ran down it."

Her life was in a constant haze in the shape of her one bedroom house. The light that filtered in through her dusty window hardly helped her sight. Janet stayed indoors so much she hardly had the energy to escape her confinements. Although walls could be breached by the turning of a knob, she felt trapped in a pit of her own despair. Sometimes she could think about a young woman she used to know, full of passion, love, and desire. She had fallen deeply in love and knew great happiness. She a decent upbringing and had high hopes of her own future. But all that ended soon after her wedding night. That young woman learned the cruelty of the world, and now understood how gray everything can be.       Her life only has two points of clarity, her husband was her light. Although a malevolent and cruel light, that light was the only time her vision became clear and her actions carried purpose. Long ago Janet learned to stop resisting the man that loved her. He worked all day and she didn't, she didn't deserve nice things, but he did. He deserved to have food on the table when he gets home, and he deserved sex whenever he wanted it. Janet was convinced she even still loved him, although her heart ached for more.  Her longing took form as the only other source of clarity; She often noticed neighbors out of her small window. In the years Janet stayed in that house she observed a young couple in love, buy their first house. She saw them become parents and saw that child run around in joy. The little child was never allowed to come near her house, although often times the family dog would, naturally curious and innocent it wasn't afraid to come sniffing around. Eventually Janet's longing turned into a desire for happiness. For the first time in decades she heard a child's laugh through her run down walls. She ran to the window and glanced out. The child was giggling as she and a dog ran in circles all over the street. And Janet smiled for the first time in decades. After a few quick minutes a honk was heard, it cut through the laughter, painfully snuffing out Janet's source of joy. Her husband had come home, angered by a runt and a rodent in his way home he laid on his horn heavily and moved them out of the way. When the child stepped to the side of the road Janet's husband sped into his driveway, hitting a small bump on the way.  All around his left tires was the red blood of a small dog.     Janet rushed to the front door, stepping into the sun with no plan and a  mass of emotions. Her husband yells, ""Get in the fucking house Janet."" But his expression has a grim satisfaction on it, as if the killing gave him pleasure. And the child's cries only added to it. The child ran back to her house, wailing for help. Janet collapsed to the ground, her source of cruel light blinded her sight of happiness and she was again in the obscure gray in which she had lived for so long. Though the gray veil she saw an angry man running toward her and her husband, unable to see and hear Janet could only see the motion. The neighbor and her husband crashed to the pavement kicking and hitting each other. And Janet sat there watching. Her husband, took out a knife, but was knocked out of his hand. The knife skidded over to Janet. Janet stared at it for long minutes, muting out the world around her.    She slowly picked it up and raised her self off the ground. Her husband was looming over their neighbor clearly winning the fight. Unaware of Janet, as he always was, she walked behind him and reached into his right pocket as her knife hand raised to his throat. She slit his neck and pulled the keys of his car from his pants. In full view of the neighbors she stared at her trembling hand as the blood of her husband ran down her arm. Slowly she stopped trembling, she was able to get in her husbands car and drive away. Fully capable of seeing the road before her."

From his seat in the back row of folding chairs, he feigned grief with a bowed head and an occasional sigh as the mortuary workers milled about the stuffy room.  As he began to realize that no other mourners would likely appear, he surreptitiously patted his left coat pocket. It was still there – baiting him, challenging him, practically daring him to do what he came to do.   He rose quietly and approached the open casket, a journey that encompassed 20 yards of carpet and 20 years of his life. Each step fed his rage and strengthened his resolve. For every day you hit me, he whispered to himself. For every time you called me stupid. For all the hate in your eyes, reserved for only me. He now stood inches from the one he feared and loathed more than all others he’d ever known. Once wasn’t enough, old man. Killing you once wasn’t enough.  He pulled the pistol from his pocket, raised it in triumph, and fired two shots.  His last thought, a second before his last shot, made him smile. So we finally share something. We finally have something in common. One for you…and one for me."

No one ever deserved to go out and into the ground without a sincere farewell. Looking through his notes, the poor and tired Director lauded the deceased's triumphs, glancing over his tribulations.   A graduate of pre-law, the young man went on to find his calling as a piano tuner. A lover of classical music and jazz alike, the terribly young man played and tuned pianos for the better part of 6 years. He would tune pianos by day -- a by and by dying profession, and would play for pennies a night at the sputtering and wheezing ""jazz clubs"" that were a high electricity bill away from bankruptcy. No one ever listened to his piano playing intentionally, and the director could surmise that his skill was somewhere between bland and uninsightful.   However, the Director went on and on about this young man before him, building him up to be some sort of chordophonic savant. His eyes gleamed with pride at this young man, who supported his love of playing with tuning pianos. A young man who gave up a life of practicing law to do what truly mattered to him: express himself via music. A life of luxury for a life of poverty -- each leading to the same room that he is in now.   The Director stopped his speech, looking over to the young man. His face was gracefully peaceful, in a way that only a body without life can pull off genuinely. He looked around the empty room, dismayed at the disrespect of the man's living relatives. No matter what, everyone deserves a funeral -- regardless of how spiteful or self absorbed the deceased's family may be. He closed the lid over the young face, realizing that he would be the last person to ever see that face. The depression that the young pianist must have felt was washing over the Director in slow, throbbing waves.  Aside from the Director himself, the killer was the only one at the funeral."

His black scale armor glistened in the desert sun. While not exceedingly comfortable in the heat, appearances had to be kept.  The crowd milling about the entrance shied away from Krodar as they struggled to make no eye contact. He could almost feel their fear.  He smiled.  An entourage of men emerged from the tower shortly after Krodar. They dragged with them some poor soul, emaciated from his time in the tower's walls. He was naked save for a waste-soaked undergarment. It was no small wonder that Krodar's Enforcers broke none of the man's bones as they hurried him along.  The throng was largely silent. None dared to utter a sound during one of Krodar's judgements. As the silent procession progressed, there was a sudden shout to Krodar's left:  ""Villain!""  Krodar stopped and snapped his head in the direction of the shout. The people were all looking about, wild-eyed with fear. Even they were searching for the source of the insult. Krodar's dark eyes scanned the mass of bodies slowly in search of his quarry.  After several seconds had passed, Krodar resumed his stride, still looking after the voice. He eventually turned his attention back to the task at hand; the execution of the wretched man behind him.  It only took a few more minutes to arrive at the raised stone platform. Krodar climbed the stairs with ease, but the prisoner's feet must have burned touching the stone as the Enforcers had to carry the man up. To his credit, he struggled little to their treatment of him.  Krodar faced the gathered crowd and cleared his throat. The man was shoved into place beside Krodar while two Enforcers flanked the prisoner.  ""I suppose I could bore you with the details of why we're here today,"" Krodar began, ""but I would like to think you are not as stupid as Collus, here.  ""Collus deemed himself a valiant man. One who could, for the good of his family, steal. Steal from hunters, from clothiers,"" Krodar paused for effect.  ""From me.""  The crowd shuffled awkwardly at that final statement. Most knew what was about to happen and the waiting just made it worse.  ""I own that hunter's stand. I own the clothiers in this city,"" he turned to face Collus. ""I own you,"" he hissed.  Some of the Enforcers who were not policing Collus stepped upon the platform and dumped lantern oil on him. As this happened, Krodar stepped behind the doomed man.  ""Let this be a lesson to you all,"" Krodar bellowed.  In a flash, Collus' body was afire, ignited from a flame produced by Krodar's own attunement to the arcane art of fire. He then swiftly kicked Collus in the back, sending him into the crowd. They parted quickly as the burning man plummeted into their midst. It took several minutes for his screams to die with his body. In all of five minutes, there was just a charred husk of the man.  Krodar smirked. He then produced a small, hand-held crossbow from his belt and fired a bolt into the forehead of one of the many in the crowd. The low murmur of the post-burning crowd was immediately silenced this new horror.  ""Care to call me 'villain' again?"" Krodar strode off the stage and, surrounded by his Enforcers, made his way back into the heart of the city.  I wonder if that was who *actually** shouted it?* he thought."

It all began when a dame hired me for a job, paying enough for it to be my retirement fund. It ends here, drinking a free rasberry cordial in an old bar and imagining it's alcohol while I wait for the goons to come and try to beat me up for helping their boss' wife investigate his secret business and any excuses to divorce him.  This job was easier when a man could get drunk legitimately.  I ask the bartender for another, and he calmly looks away when I add in a little bit of my 'medicine', a bit of 77' Casiligre, a terrible year, but purchaseable as it's more antifreeze and watered down, unfermented grape juice with a bit of grapepicker sweat in it than alcohol.  It was going to be a long night, even if they lose my trail.  I see them in the door, and follow them out.  They 'wants youse to speak with da Boss'.  I can do that, sure.  They take me to the car and drive. I had a meeting with the Don of Chicago a few hours later. Suffice it to say he was more than slightly annoyed with me emptying my stomach onto his front porch.

It reminded me of the summer days to come, the joy I'd have, the life I was looking forward to.  After twenty years, I was almost free. I'd go to bed, wake up tomorrow morning, and have one last day. After that, I was home free. Retirement. Finally.   I'd never again have to worry about running into some snot-nosed little punk with something to prove.  I broke my own rule, of course. I'd always stayed single, because this life just isn't worth sharing. But I met her a year ago, and everything changed. I couldn't wait any longer.  I proposed earlier today. I know, I know, but it's only one day left. I had to know. She said yes. Hallelujah, she said yes. We spent the afternoon putting a down payment on a new houseboat. We both have always wanted to travel, to see the world.  Boat's called the ""Live Forever.""  So I go to bed, have sweet dreams of the future, and wake up to the most beautiful morning I've ever seen. The sun is shining, the birds are singing. I put on my uniform without any worry. This was an easy gig, I'd made sure of that. Nothing could go wrong.  At least that's what I had thought.  When I get there, I see him. I knew the type. Blonde hair, dark and beady little eyes. A rat nose. The sight of him fills me with loathing, because I actually think I have some inkling of what's to come. The usual shit. The screaming, the yelling, getting surrounded by his cronies while everyone stares on in shock.  Back towards the porch, I see a crowd of teenagers pointing at me with demented grins on their faces. They know better than me what's coming. The assholes have their phones out, going to film it.  I'm going to be famous. My last day is going to be on YouTube, or maybe Liveleak. Goddamnit.  Still, I gotta do what I gotta do. Nobody ever said this job would be easy, and the show must go on. I don my wig, my nose, and rush out into the yard.  My oversized suspenders fall down, but nobody laughs.  The flower in my pocket squirts water, and the little shit yawns.  I sing Happy Birthday in a high-pitched voice, but the teenagers have started heckling me.  I look around, and some angry parents are shooting daggers at me with their eyes. They're going to want their deposit back.  I sigh, and do my best to finish the routine, but I already know it's too late. By this time tomorrow, those videos are going to have a million hits each. My worst fear, a bad performance going viral. I'll never be able to face my girl again. My family will disown me. My friends will abandon me.   I've seen it happen before, it's part of the job. Every clown's fear, I just never really believed it would happen to me. One failure, and my whole damn life is over.  Goddamnit, dad was right. I shoulda been a cop.

It was fashioned out of polished and crafted brass and other metalwork. An owl with a large clock in its stomach, which was perfectly on time as far as I could see.   “Is it more than that?” I ask the professor as I sat across the table from him.   “Quite more!” He exclaimed, as he began to fiddle with the inner workings once more. I simple sat and watched. The professor was a fascinating man, and just a tad crazy with his inventions. He boasted many things were possible, such as time travel, creation through alchemy, and even reincarnation. This must have been another one of those impossible experiments.   I opened a book as he worked, checking on him every so often. Each time, he seemed just a step closer to completing it, but then would double back and ‘fix’ something. It was strange to say the least.   “Why did you make this professor?”   “Why not more like,” He replied quickly. “I wanted an owl really. So I decided to make one that was also useful.”   “Are you saying this thing will, fly? Hoot? And whatever else owls do?”   “You’re damn right it will,” He closed its chest a final time. “It’s done. Let’s see what it can do.”   He began winding and twisting something near its back, and then sat down to wait. “It is wound and ready. Now we just wait to see if he wants to come out.”   I began to ask, but thought better to go back to my book. This was illogical, and strange for the professor to actually act this far through his experiment. It usually lasted about three days, and one failed attempt and he was done with the idea for a span, but this… it looked to be quite the project for being such a small owl.   Wait… Machine. It isn’t an owl. It’s just a clock if anything.   Lost in thought, I didn’t even notice that it had moved. It had been two hours since I had gone back to my book, and the professor was fast asleep in his chair. The bird… machine… clock creature was gone!? Did it actually fly away? It couldn’t really…   Soon, a metallic hoot came from out the window, and there, on the branch, sat the owl, its head tilted sideways, looking in at us…   I was dumbfounded, surprised, but beyond that, entranced. He was right. It isn’t a clock. It’s alive."

It was the first time in what seemed like days that he was able to rest his feet. The auto driver took control, charting a direct path to the terminal. The computerized voice informed him that the trip from one end of the space station to the other would take 23 minutes. Damien settled in.  The engineer gazed out of the window of the cab. The nearby scenery flew by in a blur. Shops, pedestrians, and other vehicles merged into hazy flashes of light and color. Beyond the walls of the orbital station, Damien could make out the massive solar wings of the transplanetary liners. When the liners undocked and the wings were unfurled, each wing would be over four kilometers in diameter. Similar to the sailboats used on Titan, they captured the solar wind, and used it to fly to the farthest reaches of the solar system. The trip to the inner Kiepler Belt that would once have taken months would take just under two weeks.  The past months had sent him flying around the solar system, assisting asteroid miners in the setup of their equipment. There were many safety regulations that had to be followed to the tee; any mistakes and hundreds of lives could be lost. Many of the mining sites were too inaccessable for tech mining bots, and the machinery had to be operated by good old fashioned human labor. Damien missed his family. Fortunately, there were only two stops lest to be made, both in the far reaches of the solar system, beyond Neptune. After that, he could return and see his daughters and wife.  The taxi slowed as it reached the terminal. Damien's musings were interrupted by a computerized voice announcing that he had reached his destination, and that if he looked to the west, he could see the beginnings of the planetrise. Damien glanced out of the window, and could see the orange clouds of Jupiter peaking over the horizon of the moon. The liner would leave in about two hours so as to use of the gas giant's gravity to gain momentum for its trip to the Kiepler belt. He should board now so that he could get a good seat.  Damien strode through the bustling terminal. Gate H3. He passed vendors and ticket machines. Every few minutes, there was the sound of a spacecraft's ignition and launch from outside of the space station. Gate G9, H1. He was getting close.  A lone figure in miners garb stood in the archway labeled H2. Damien's gaze would have normally passed over him, but the man carried a paper sign with lettering, a very unusual sight. Damien read the sign, and felt drawn to the man. He approached the miner, and as he did so, reread the homemade sign.  Cannot afford for ticket to Neptune. Will repay upon arrival."

Across the globe televisions flicker with every angle of the situation imaginable: photos from the ground, inconclusive readings from NASA, satellite images, an interview with a lauded astrophysicist. A group of very brave astronauts elect to blast up there and solve the mystery once and for all.  But funding dictates everything, no? Supercomputers crunch numbers and mathematicians double-check said numbers — thus ruling otherwise.  Exactly five years on people remember — and move on. At the ceremony people are tuned attentively into the transmission, and equally up to the night sky. Or day, depending on where they are.  Then another moon—a specially-crafted satellite masquerading as a celestial being—is hoisted up into the sky, into space, hung up there like a painted, wooden slab of a crescent is hung against the backdrop of a play. Just like that.  Gradually the stories begin to change. The moon is no longer the haven of a demure goddess, no more a cherished lover whom the Sun sacrificed himself to let her breathe.

Or the cults that screamed about a second coming and buying off god. Or the blood things that hid in the dark corners of the lands, whispering secrets to try and take people. How could so wondrous a time ever exist? A time when the air didn't burn your face during the few moments you might go above ground. A time when the continents didn't eat towns.   There was someone in our town, he didn't give us his name but he was old and wore a ragged army uniform. He said that there was a place....a foundation, where things could be fixed. Where they had machines to make all of this go back to ""the way it was"". None of us knew what that was because we'd only ever known this time, this savage time. Most of us insisted that we'd been born after this but he said that time was moving differently because of ""some damn clock"" and that it actually hadn't been very long. He said that things would go back and that they would fix everything. That it was simple and that ""all the experts were just hidden"".   None of us ever saw him again."
SimplePrompts,3duotq,canadianD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"When we look up, our breaths catch—the whole sky is moving. Not drifting, not like it does on a languid July afternoon, when we peek out from beneath the patio's aluminum roof. No, it's racing. Charcoal clouds pumping up from the horizon like time-lapse photography. I've never seen them do that before. I never knew they could. When I picture the planet we live on, I see the bright blue-and-green globe in Miss Studder's second-grade classroom, superimposed onto the cavernous blackness of space. I picture a rubber ball so unfathomably large that it struggles to move itself, so that everything around us maintains the constant illusion of stillness. Because most of the time it does. But not today. Today is like a sprung trap. All those years of tranquility, and the Earth had this hostility inside of it all along, this impending violence. Like a dog you've known for years that suddenly bites.   ""Hey,"" Pop calls from behind us. We both turn, me and Jules, and see him standing in the shadowed doorway, one hand gripping the frame as though to steady himself. His shirt collar and hair are whipping around like crazy, like someone's taken that big box fan from the garage and put it right up beside him. His face has an odd shape to it, a pulling together of all the features, and at first I don't recognize it. Then I realize that he looks like I look, his face is doing what mine is doing. He's scared, like I'm scared.   ""C'mon inside,"" he says, a little loudly, over the wind. ""I don't want ya'll out here right now. Storm's gonna pick up in just a cuppa minutes, aright? I gotta keep an eye on ya.""  The two of us hesitate, there at the edge of the yard. Heels on the sharp edge of brick, toes digging into the grass. There's something about going back inside that makes us reluctant. An animal feeling, hard to get a hold on, something about being trapped when it all starts to happen. But Pop promised us the house would hold. The McElsters, who live in the trailer park on Route 10, they have to go stay with family in Destin, and worry that maybe their house will be spread all over the park when they come back tomorrow. But ours is brick and old oak, thumbing its nose at hurricanes since 1959. And it's only a 2, anyway, this storm. Roof ain't gonna break a sweat, Pop tells us. But them little arms 'n legs'll get tossed around the yard like kindling. He says it's best for us to keep inside, away from the windows, with our flashlights and our water gallons and our Chinese Checkers.   Jules turns and gives me a glance, questioning. He's two years younger; to him, I'm the third parent. I can feel the glance, but I don't look back. I'm still watching Pop, still wondering how he can make the sort of promises he does when he's looking the way he is right now. ""You're sure we're gonna be okay?"" I ask, and it's not because I don't know what he'll say. It's because in this moment, out here, with the storm coming in like the first car in a long and awful train with its whistle blowing across the sky, I want to see how he'll say it.   Pop fixes me with a look, and I know he knows what I'm doing. I don't care; I want him to. ""I said so, din't I?"" he replies. ""Now get on back."" He waves a hand inside, toward the cool darkness of the house, where everything is unmoving, everything is just as we've left it, untouched by the growing commotion. Jules gives me one more glance, then shuffles inside obediently, curious face rising up as he passes underneath Pop's outstretched arm. But I take one more second, turn and look at the sky again. Still rushing toward me, still bringing a disaster I've only ever known from stories my parents and grandparents would tell. It's my turn now, to watch it sweep over our heads, watch the rain crash down and the leaves spiral around the house, hear the thunderous crack of limbs being ripped from ancient trees. Strange, that I should be so much less frightened standing out here.   ""You comin'?"" Pop grunts. ""Or do I gotta pick y'up like a caveman 'n drag y'in?""  I turn and head for the door, hands in my pockets. When I pass Pop by I don't look up at him, like Jules. ""Ain't nobody gotta drag me,"" I tell him."

With it came warmth, protection, and guidance. Tall green stalks shot from the earth in a bountiful tribute to the brilliant sphere of energy. This light was a gift from the gods, and we were chosen to bask in its cyclical grace. It was impossible to understand, yet we knew it served a higher purpose. The most we could do was appreciate the life it brought forth and give thanks to the gods for their mercy. And as it rose each day, it met the waiting faces of the settlements it led.  There are no gods now. The sun is governed by numbers, equations, and symbols. We are no longer at the mercy of the sun. The universe is a canvas, and each soul on this domesticated sphere a bristle on the brush of Time. We are the gods, the forces that shape the world around us and dictate the rules of humanity. And as we spread our influence throughout the stars, the sun will continue to rise and fall. But all of the wonder is gone."

""Wot you suppose they doin'?"" Orton asked, now as confused as Winns.  ""I haven't the foggiest, my smelly friend,"" Winns replied, reclaiming his spyglass unceremoniously. He closed it.  ""We should inform the governor. He'd want to know about this.""  ""Aw, why we 'ave to do a fing like that?"" Orton complained. ""'E's not my favorite bloke, ya know?""  ""Who exactly is your favorite bloke?"" Winns replied, expecting no answer. ""The fact is, human nomads are settling on dwarven lands. The governor must be told.""  Orton grimaced and sighed in compliance. ""Well then, guess we best get back, eh?""  Winns hoisted his rucksack with a nod and began the long, if not mundane walk back. Humans...settling. The last time humans had gotten involved with the elves and dwarves, many lives had been lost, even if those humans came from across the sea. The only reason the nomads were tolerated was that they warred amongst themselves more than with other nations. If they were working together now, what would that mean for everyone else? Winns didn't like the thought of it."

""These are not our lands, Scout Orton,"" Governor Remdi replied flatly. ""These are dwarven lands, and I fail to see why this concerns you.""  The court in attendance to this hearing murmured in approval. Dwarves had never been truly friendly with elves, regardless of any alliance the two maintained.  Orton was about to reply when Winns cut him off. ""Lord Remdi, it makes little difference whose lands these are. The pressing matter is the nomad presence being so coherent. What if this turns into another Travashian conflict?""  Governor Remdi wrinkled his nose as a gasp rippled through the courtesans. ""The nomads are not to be compared to the Travashians,"" he sneered. ""Travashian humans killed my people, killed my friends. I'll not degrade their memory by comparing their murderers to mindless savages.""  Orton and Winns exchanged glances as the court focused their accusatory glares at them.  ""The Travashians were calculated, precise, and merciless in their attacks,"" the governor continued, ""and the fact that they still have a foothold, one brokered by your kind-"" he gestured toward Orton ""-is enough to set my blood boiling.""  Orton winced at the statement while more approving whispers and gestures coursed through the gathered nobles. Winns bowed his head slightly but remained unphased. ""Then I misspoke, your honor. I meant neither you nor the memory of those you lost any disrespect. I simply intend to point out that we may have a new threat on our hands.""  The governor's countenance did not change. ""Regardless of what you intended, Sir Winns, your words still cut deeply. Report to your commanding officer and begone from my sight.""  Winns looked back up, gravely. He looked momentarily at Orton and then strode out, head high. Orton was about to request his leave when the governor spoke again.  ""You. Return to your elven brethren"" he spat. ""I have no need for your services any longer.""  Orton made to reply but was cut off by Remdi forcefully pointing to the door. Orton caught his words and strode out. He never did care for that man, anyway.  Surprisingly, Winns was standing right outside.  ""Fot you were goin' to your commanding officer."" Orton said.  Winns' expression morphed from blank to annoyed. ""If the governor knew anything about military presence here, he would know that my commander was out on maneuvers for the next seven days.""  Orton snorted a laugh and wrapped his arm around Winns' neck, even if he had to bend somewhat.  ""See? I knew you didn't like the s'wot.""  ""I never said I did,"" Winns grumbled back, shrugging Orton's arm off his shoulder. ""We should get back to watching the nomads. Regardless of what the governor says, we need to be on our toes."""
SimplePrompts,3dttjg,RKingsfield,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"The desert is not the place to raise a family. Sand covers everything the moment you put it down. If you’re not careful where you put thing, the desert will bury it under its sands. You will lose it. So you keep your possessions on you, and you keep moving, hoping to come across another lifeline somewhere is the desert to keep you going that little bit longer.  I’ve been walking these sands my entire life. It’s a dreary existence but giving up is even drearier. At least when I’m alive, I have hope for something more. Something more for me, and something more for my people.  Something odd thing happens when you come across a stranger in the desert. When it’s the first human contact you’ve had in weeks, you immediately become best friends. Even if you can’t speak the same language, you figure out how to get by if it means that you suddenly have someone else to share the burden. Stranger still is when more and more people start coming across you. You start as one, and end as hundreds.  A swarm of people moving across the sand. Never stopping.  Wind burn is all too common. What little fabric most people have is spread over as much of their body as they can. The coarse sand erodes away your skin as the wind slaps it into you. It also erodes your will. Your humanity. Your hope.  Sometimes people would just give up. They’d stop in place, then just sit down. No one could get them to move again. The sand would just pile up around them and they’d surrender to their fate.  Of course, in the desert, you can’t afford to let anything go to waste. So they come with the herd. They can choose to be people, or they can be cattle, but either way they come.  There of course lies another danger in traversing the desert in this way. Seldom does it happen, but when you cross paths with another herd, there is nothing else to do but try and take what they cannot hold onto. Coming together is not an option when this happens. A herd that is too big cannot survive. It all comes down to survival in the end. If you do not have the force to defend your things, then you lose them.   This was our way of life and we knew no different. We had adapted to this way of life. Scavenging off the land, fighting other herds and taking what is our right. We knew no different than what we had always known.  The green desert was always a rumour that I hadn’t put much stock into. I kept our people marching, I let them gossip and believe whatever they needed to. I didn’t put any faith into ever finding the green desert, or even that it existed. Yet the sands had thinned and the shrubbery had grown more common.  We had made it to the green desert.  I stood at the front of my herd, my people stood behind in a cluster. I suspected that they too didn’t ever truly believe in this place. Yet here we stood, on the precipice of a new way of life.  It was our time now. We finally had the room to grow. Food was more abundant when it grew within the green lands. Or so the rumours had told us. We could finally see what these great floods of water looked like, rather than collecting it from the sky and taking it with us.  We could grow in this place. Share our community with others that found us. Start a new way of life. Or maybe we should keep this oasis for ourselves.   Edward soon came to stand next to me. I looked at him, and he at me. We regarded each other for a moment, I took in the sight of my old friend. My oldest friend. He looked as weary as I felt. Yet we had both made it through everything.  “We would claim this land as ours, you know. No other herd ever had the strength to stand against us. We could defend this land.” I told him.  Edward’s brow creased as he thought to himself. He raised his hand above his eyes and scanned the distant horizon. Greenland as far as the eye could see. Trees bearing strange fruit sat in the distance. Small animals grazing lazily. He looked in silence as he scanned further, taking in everything in front of him.  Edward cleared his throat as he began speaking to me again. “We could claim this land. But…” He paused. Edward turned back to from the lush grassland to face me. “Do you have a flag?”"

There was only enough time for base-level conversations and moving on. All career paths were lateral. I knew enough about hiking to know how to maintain elevation. Want for stronger company came and went in fits, so I didn’t dwell on it. I dwelled in woods and mountains and bars, on back porches and acquaintance couches. I never more than half-established myself. Hi, my name is Ben and I’m “from around.” Nice to meet you. Can I participate in your life long enough for routine to set in and then bail like the troublesome water of substance in the boat that is my ego?   The nomads began settling down in the wake of agriculture. Moving in order to support livestock through the seasons was unsustainable in the face of reliability. You can store grain in a silo. You can have more specialized labor. You can fit more people into a smaller space. It seems like a pretty sweet deal.   Epidemics, famines, weather disasters, money, class wars, social stratification, militarization, monarchy, harder work, worse teeth, more limited diet, more child labor, less social justice. Settling down is the worst thing I’ve ever wanted.   He was the hateful flask in my pocket that inebriated me into slowing down. I came peacefully and believingly. The apex of an existential crisis can be powerful in that way. There were driver’s licenses to get, fights to get too deeply into, beds to share, aspirations to give up on. There was so much to do that I was overwhelmed and tired. The vacation was over and suddenly life seemed very long.   I appreciate the changing skyline, but right now I am just so tired."
SimplePrompts,3drzzm,Writes_Sci_Fi,2,Sat Jul 18 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"There is something unnerving about silence. It seeps into your being and penetrates your mind causing you to think thoughts that are better left in the darkness. It brings out your insecurities, your fears, and it chips away at you. An hour with naught but silence causes you to think. A day to doubt. A week to fear. And a year for that rot of madness to set in. So do try to imagine what spending a millennia of silence will do to a man.  Years sitting and contemplating your decisions, regretting your choices and cursing your past. It might be hard for you, never having spent more than a day or a week in silence but think on this. One little drop of water from a ceiling hits the ground. Shortly after another follows, and then another. These drops will continue for years and years and soon two pillars will have formed. Give it long enough and they will meet, ground and ceiling. Those pillars are you, your doubts, your sins, your insecurities, your past. They build up and down in the silence until nothing is left but them. You become consumed by your past.  And then he comes and breaks those pillars, cleans those sins. You see hope once again. You feel again. The silence is still there but now you are stronger, you have found something to believe in. A day goes by, a week, a month, a year, another millennia. The silence remains and the sins come back.  Then he comes again and cleans them once more. He gives you hope and strength, a new future. A day goes by, a week, a month, a year another millennia. The silence returns.  Ah but here he comes again to free you from your sins. He frees you but then stands, smiling cruelly as your sins flow back. It is a cruel lie he spins. When you are new here you are naive and trust in him and his hope he promises to you. But as the silence is broken, and brought back, and broken, and brought back you begin to lose hope. And one day you will learn that in Hell there is no hope, for hope, like everything else here, is dead."

The lady, her ploy  Came from within,  She sought the man of the coup.  His footprint it lead  To a small broken shanty  Nestled in a forest of pine.

I would usually open another wormhole and dive through it, hoping to arrive at a period of time where she wasn’t lying in wait.  The Cretaceous period. Victorian times. The end of the Earth. World War II. The Ming Dynasty. The Transhuman War.  No matter how early or late I fled, she knew where I was going. She would wait in front of the swirling exit of the wormhole, her face dispassionate, waiting as though she was always there.  “You owe me a bullet.”  I sighed. She had loved me for a thousand years, and now she was just a shadow of herself. A five-word automaton, doomed to ask for an end. To stain my soul with guilt for spurning her.  I was tired.

SimplePrompts,3dknz7,Dynosmite,3,Fri Jul 17 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"They would be coming tonight. Droves of them, hundreds if not thousands of them. I slowly lifted the glass to my lips, and took a deep swig from it. I placed the glass down, and just reached for the bottle instead. No need to beat around the bush.  The rope was tied around a piece of stone I had brought up to my apartment a long time ago, when I was younger and more full of delusion. The room was abnormally silent tonight, everyone in a deep contemplation.  Life. Death. The meaning of it all. The ""great beyond"". I took another pull from the bottle, the warm fuzziness beginning to flush over me.  The rope was thrown outside the back window into the alley behind my apartments. The fence was cut right in front of the wall, to allow access. My car, back to the fence, sat there, waiting. This plan had been set so long ago...except for this new part.  I could feel my hands trembling, my vision blurring: whether from the alcohol or from my fear, I didn't know. I had thought a lot about how I was going to die, but at the end of the day I had just decided not to. Today was different. It's hard to both want to sacrifice yourself for the greater good and to never die.  You eventually pick one.  I felt like my sigh broke the silence in the room. The first voice to speak up was from my brother. ""Are you sure?"" I nodded almost exaggeratedly: I'm the only person who can maybe survive this. None of you did sports, none of you work out very much. I conditioned myself for a moment like this.  Then, it was my ex. ""I'm sorry."" I didn't even respond to her, I didn't want my last feelings to be disappointment and bitterness. Her current boyfriend just shook my hand, while the stranger I had saved and allowed to stay with me just kissed my cheek and wiped her own tears from her face. I think I liked my ex's boyfriend's response the best.  As soon as you hear the music, you drop down the rope. You jump in the car, and you leave. For absolutely no reason are you to turn around, hesitate, or stop. I don't care if I'm waving my arms at you from your rear-view mirror, you do NOT STOP.  If I was going to die, it was going to be in style. Might as well enjoy my last few moments. My brother hugged me. We weren't the kind of brothers to hug, but I guess now was a day as any. ""Better meet up with us."" I chuckled. Find yourself a good man, or I'll haunt you. He laughed, and hugged me again before he moved towards the back of the room.  I laid out the weapons on my table. The shotgun was modified to expel both shots and not alternate between the barrels. The handgun was fitted with a turret-like feed for bullets, useful against the fast fucks. But, the best one of them all...was the shovel.  KA-BAR quality steel, flattened and shaped like a shovel (for lack of better term), fitted on a broomstick (you do what you can) and made right down to the tang: there was no better adrenaline rush than physically slicing someone's head in almost half.  I looked at the clock: 22:37. We had a few minutes before those things woke up and stormed in here like rabid dogs to rabbits. The Whiskey had found itself situated in my veins now, the trembling gone and my body warm. Whatever I was feeling now, it sure as hell wasn't fear.  I made sure the trail went right out my door and toward the cars on the sides of the roads in front of my apartment. I only had one shot to create a big enough diversion, and I could handle my own death but not failing people I cared about. The gasoline gallon was also right outside my apartment door, just in case it didn't go completely as expected. A saving grace.  I started to hear the murmurs and growls coming from beneath our floor. I nodded to them to get ready, and pushed play on my laptop. The music had been turned up to its loudest, and plugged into some old speakers my mom gave me when I was still in college. Doing you proud, mom.   Their shrieks almost rivaled the music, and maybe if I hadn't been drunk it would've scared me a bit. But, almost as if the whole world had been cleared right in front of my eyes, I wasn't afraid. I yelled at them to go, and turned around and picked up the shotgun. The lyrics began:   This night ain't for the faint of heart  For the faint of heart  For the faint of heart  This night ain't for the faint of heart  'Cause the faint of heart gon' fall apart   The first few ran in: shoot. Pump. Reload. The bullets had been fitted on a fork of sorts for quicker usage. A couple more: shoot. Pump. Reload. I had a dozen or so more pairs of shots before I had to switch. I had to be careful. They were smart, they would run from the fire once they saw it. They have to swarm me.  I glanced quickly behind me to make sure they were gone. I started backing up toward the window. The pistol in my holster, the shovel latched onto my back, and the bullet-feed on my side. A few more: shoot. Pump. A straggler, throw the shotgun on my back, swing the shovel: cut. Like clockwork, just like before. No different, no harder. That had to be the mindset.  Shovel back, shotgun out, reload. The screams were getting louder, there were more. Half a dozen this time: shoot their feet. Pump. Reload. Shoot them again: dead. Pump. Reload. A few more rounds of this. A big one. Shoot the chest, pump, reload, shoot the head. Pump. Reload. Those ones were the worst. I threw the shotgun out the door, and clipped the feed to the handgun and aimed it at the door.  I could see them running down the street, dozens. Some of them tried searching the bottom floors before climbing the stairs. They weren't the smartest creatures, and that was alright by me. A few. Aim at the head, don't hold the trigger down too long. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, aim up. Assess, repeat. They were lining the stairs now, making it harder for the other ones to get in.  I quickly reached for the gasoline gallon and doused some of the bodies. I had to conserve that for as long as possible for this. I had about 30 bullets left with the pistol, then came the fun part. I never knew if I was immune to changing or not, I felt I had been bitten before, but I wasn't going to risk injury in case I hadn't. Nothing makes you feel more alive than that, however. They kept coming, and I kept shooting. Once I heard the familiar click of the gun, I threw it at the first creature in front of me, and drew out my shovel.    We the wicked ones  The wicked ones   Here goes. The swings had to be smart, can't leave myself exposed and can't be too aggressive. First one, diagonal down, make sure to cross the left arm and right hip. Second one, no creatures behind, stab. Kick it off the blade, raise it up ready for the next one.  I peered out the door, there were a good group of them coming up, they were swarmed underneath the stairs, all waiting for a turn toppling over each other. This is as good a time as any. I threw the gasoline gallon outside the window, aiming toward the cars but just trying to cover as many things as I could. I grabbed the flare from underneath my table, lit it, and threw it right in between the mob of monsters.  The fire burned intensely as the screams finally overcame the music. Some of the things ran in, bodies ablaze. Can't get shit like this out by the inlands. I used the shovel to cut one of its legs, it went down, and began crawling toward me, my living room starting to catch fire as the other things leaped over it. This was good. I ran toward the window, and slid down the rope to the fence. I knew they'd follow, so I had another gasoline gallon by the window.  I started sprinting toward the gasoline station right by my apartments: I could not have planned for a better location. The guitar solo echoed throughout the night as I ran and found my old motorcycle hidden underneath rubble and debris. I started it up, and headed out down the street.  I never did get to finish hearing the song, the explosion was incredibly loud, and I assume my laptop was burnt to a crisp along with anything within a mile radius. The trails of gasoline had led to every car on the street, and the explosion was nothing less than majestic, lighting up the night as if the sun had come up for a few seconds before the world was submerged back into darkness and silence.  The only noise now was the rumbling of my engine as I raced down the streets, hoping to escape."

SimplePrompts,3dkzd7,elowygn,2,Fri Jul 17 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"Entering the shop was a victory in its own right, getting to the counter was another mission entirely. She stood frozen, looking around, but saw little merchandise in her view. The shop windows never displayed anything, except signs that read, ‘come find out!’ written in what looked like lipstick. She couldn’t see any other customers either. Was this a shop?   She had been dared to enter, and she was not going to ruin her reputation by going back on a dare. Now Rena stood there, too afraid to move and too scared to turn back.   “Well well, hello little kitten,” The deep bass voice rang behind her. She turned swiftly and jumped back. In her few, a tall white haired man stood; his hand where her back might have been. “Relax. I was just seeing if you needed anything,” He smirked. “You sure are jumpy.”   “Well I…” She stammers, still backing up a little. The man was jarring to see if you were not expecting him. The contrast of his hair and black suit made him look rather imposing. “What… is this place?”   “Oh, you must be one of those high-schoolers who are too curious for their own good.” He said coldly, “Well, I’ll have you know we don’t take kindly to them here. In fact…” He said, putting his hands in his pockets, a grin stretching across his face, “We eat them.”   Her face went from scared to dead in the matter of a few seconds. Fear froze her in place, until two soft hands rested on her shoulders. Turning, she was met with a very beautiful woman’s face near hers. “He’s just kidding sweetie.” The woman’s voice said sweetly, near the flavor of honey, “We wouldn’t hurt you. Vic, go get the instruments. I’ll show you what we do here. It isn’t all that bad.” She smiled once more, and motioned the girl over to a room to her right.   A huge deep blue velvet room lay before the two. A couch of sorts sat near a table, with a deep blue cloth over it, and tulips in a vase atop it. A chair is next to them, with a notepad of sorts in the chair. The rest of the walls are adorned with black or blue velvet patterned wallpaper, and a few other accessories, such as a few framed paintings and a bookshelf.   “Go ahead and have a seat dear. Vic will be back soon.”   “I don’t want to… cause any trouble. What are you going to do to me?” She asked, still scared to death.   “We are going to talk. That’s all. I was serious when I said I wouldn’t hurt you.” She gave another refreshing smile. Each time, it made Rena feel a bit safer, and more comfortable with the situation. She was a beautiful woman by any standards. A well-defined curve ran down her side, and the blue dress she wore was gorgeous on her. Her white skin and yellow eyes contrasted well with the surrounds and her dress, and her white hair helped the contrast as well.   Yellow eyes?  Soon, Rena was laying down on the couch, her head resting in the chairs direction. She sat up, just in time to see Vic set down a tray of items; a pen, a vial with a stopper, and a deck of what look to be Tarrot Cards.   Confused, but intrigued, Rena looks over to the woman. “Are you ready?” She asks, with the same easy smile.   Rena nodded, hesitantly, and leaned back onto the couch.   The easy voice of the woman came again. “I want you to try and relax. We’re just going to take a little step into your mind, and see a few things. Do not worry. We don’t keep anything you tell us. We are simply here to help. We do keep one thing, and we need your permission to do so.”   Vic moved forward, and reached down with an outstretched hand, asking for Rena’s. “Do you wish to see what you are? If so, I need a drop of your blood. We will draw it here and keep it here. Do you agree?”   Rena was scared again. Nervous, and trembling slightly, she took Vic’s hand. Once she did, she felt at ease suddenly and said, “Yes. I agree. Show me what I am.”   The pen came swiftly, and hit her index finger. A few drops of blood rose to the surface, and Vic steadied the vial under Rena’s finger.   “This is the path you have chosen. We are to view your fears, your motives, your ambitions, and what you desire most. Your life will be known to us, and your lies will be shown, as well as your truths,” The woman said, now standing up over Rena, “Prepare yourself Rena. We are going to view who you truly are.”   The vial of blood was half full, and with that, Vic put a small bandage over the wound, and moved the Tarrot Cards over to the vial, and then proceeded to pour the blood through the cards. It was strange. The cards could somehow pass the blood through themselves, and not around them. It was mythical or otherworldly to Rena, but the sights around her were a more engaging illusion than that. All around her, her past flung by, her hopeful future displayed across the walls and all the lies she had ever told washed over them with red, while the truths displayed a brilliant sky blue. Soon, the blood had made it through the cards, and into another vial. Rena lay back down; her mind assaulted and tired, and closed her eyes.   When she awoke, the woman and Vic sat across from her, in their own chairs. “Ah you are awake. Val, she’s up.”   Val set down a cup and saucer. “I see that Vic. Give me a moment.” She cleared her throat, and began. “What do you see on that table Rena?”   Upon the table lay the deck of cards, all laid out. Each looked somewhat stained with her blood, but some were more than others. There was one that was completely red around the edges, and other completely blue around the edges.   “This is your life, as well as what we have given you. The red card, your deepest lies, and darkest secrets, is something you must control, and make your own.” She held it up, displaying the red rimmed card, The Devil. “You thrive on the views that others give you. If they do not love you or stroke that ego of yours, you are furious, and do anything to change it. You don’t go as far as breaking the law, but the thought has crossed your mind many a time. You don’t control yourself well, unless it will harm you in the end.” She cleared her throat once more. “Am I correct?”   Stunned, but understanding, Rena nodded slowly. It felt as if she were being judged in some way.  Val then held up the other card, rimmed in blue, Justice. “You defend others when they need it. You bring up issues that would not affect you in the slightest, but would help the individual you are helping. You strive to help those in need.”   Rena looked embarrassed. It’s like they were reading her as an open book.   “Quite the combination,” She smiled.   She tossed the cards to Rena, and motioned for her to stand. “Focus on the blue card, and focus on what you want to protect the most and what you want to do with your life.”   Rena followed the instructions without question. She closed her eyes and began to think. She felt whole for maybe the first time in her life, and did not want to go back to what she was. She began thinking, and then, the card left her hand, and was replaced with something else, something much bigger.   She looked down to see a large sword in her right hand, still radiating a blue light.   “Now, focus on the other card. Focus on what you do. Now that you know what lies you spin and what you truly are, you can harness that, and make it your own. Think about how you want to change and show the world that you are different now.”   The same process began, and soon, the card disappeared again. This time however, nothing was in her hand. She felt a presence behind her, something large. She turned slowly, and saw a creature she thought were simply in fairy tales and myths. A being with black eyes, horns on its head, clawed hands and a tail with a spade at the end. It bowed slowly, and looked up at Rena. “My name is Dinn. It is a pleasure to meet you, my Master.”   Out of nowhere, Val came forth, and smiled at Rena, “This is what we do here at True Lies Rena. We divulge what you truly are; the lies, the truths, your ambitions, and your fears. We reveal them all to you, and give you the tools to combat what you need in a more real way. Things will be much different for you now, but always remember you can come see us here for help. You may find some new friends to help you along the way. Who knows? The world is now open to you. There is so much you can do now! No matter what happens, though,” She gave a small pause, allowing Rena to take in the situation, “Always remember: The Truth Lies Inside You.” She smiled, before Dinn disappeared with a flash, and she found herself now at the entrance of the shop once more, with Val and Vic sitting behind the counter.   “Come see us again. Or bring your friends. We always want to show people what they truly are.” She gave the same smile once more before waving goodbye to the high-schooler that had wandered into their shop.     This got out of hand quickly, and I couldn't stop. I'm sorry. I hope it is still enjoyable."

SimplePrompts,3dgy92,Dancing_Torpedo,3,Thu Jul 16 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"The bus was an old one, a slimy steel box not yet decrepit enough to decommission. As Steven climbed the steps into its musty interior, his senses were assailed by the essence of filth. Disheveled masses lined the rows and sent the distinct odor of stale smoke into his nostrils. ""Men like me don't belong on this bus,"" he thought with displeasure. For the fourth day in a row, he took a yellowed seat towards the back and thought of his ex-wife's smug face behind the wheel of his Camry.  The bus headed south on Broad. Buildings flashed by in the window, each one a derelict reminder of the town Steven worked so hard to escape. As the bus slowed to collect a new passenger, he quickly realized with disdain that the only empty seat lay between himself and the window. His shoes fought against his attempt to switch seats, finally unsticking from the ground with an unpleasant tcck. He caught a glimpse of the new arrival: a grungy young man with a mane of unkempt blonde hair. A smile dominated his face and revealed a row of yellow teeth.   ""They cover their arms in tattoos and then wonder why they can't get jobs,"" Steven thought dryly, trying not to acknowledge the man as he took a seat. He ventured a quick glance to at his new companion and noted the red swollen flesh on his left bicep outlining the numbers '1989-2015'. It looked painful and unprofessional, something a man with no self respect would do to his body. The smile was still plain on the man's face as he asked ""You smoke, chief?""   ""No,"" Steven said sharply. The smell that pervaded the bus certainly wasn't giving the idea any favor in his mind.  ""Ah, never mind then. Where you headed?""  Steven's jaw clinched involuntarily as he wondered how he managed to put up with living in the American South.  ""Work.""  ""Ah, yeah you have that look to you. Good on you for managing to find work these days. Probably doing something more than cooking pizzas huh?""  Steven turned stiffly, as though any extra motion would expose his suit to more of the bus's filth.  ""Engineering, actually."" His thoughts went to the day that was ahead of him, the day he would relive until he found a new job or was old enough to retire. The very idea made him exhausted. As he pondered the dead-end path before him, exhaustion turned to anger.   ""Why are you so damn happy?""  The young man's eyes grew sharp at the question, his smile softening with what appeared to be pity. He brought a hand to his unshaven face.   ""Got nothing to feel sad about, chief. I'm here, talking to you. Whole day in front of me. Hell, whole life in front of me. Sun's out, you're alive, so why aren't YOU happy, brother?""  As the creaking bus cleared downtown, the sunlight pierced the grimy window and warmed the back of Steven's neck. He thought of the sun, the omnipresent force that brought life to the world. He could skip work today and tomorrow and every day after that, and the sun would stay on course. His wife could take his car, but she couldn't take the brilliant globe of energy that illuminated the endless world around him. Even when it fell, he could be sure that tomorrow promised light's return. And in the bustling uncertainty of Life, he took solace in the rising of the sun."

""I look death in the eye and smile because I know I've done all I can. But you—"" With this, I pour every drop of loathing into that word. ""You—you were dead long ago.""  They make no movement, no twitch of the mouth, not even a blink.  They've lowered their knife from a forward attack lunge to a menacing grip just in front of them.   ""When was your first kill?"" I ask, tears now mixing with the rain running down my face and pooling in red-brown puddles below me. ""We're you 10? 12? When you began to... to train, to steel yourself against the abomination of murdering your own kind? We are not only humans, sharing a planet and a linear timeline, but, GOD, we are neighbors!""  They run their tongue across their lips, drinking in the rain.  I know I haven't had a drink in days.   ""You know why PTSD exists?"" I continue, dragging myself back further and further away—no longer toward an escape, but away from their apathy, their weapon. ""Because humans are emotionally unequipped to deal with the trauma of ending another's life."" I stop crawling.   ""Look at me!"" I shout, pushing my fingernails into my chest. ""REALLY look at me—past my skin and scars.  I'm 17 years full of memories and emotion and pain and organic tissue. You practically have my life in your hands—could you really end it now?""  They readjust their grip on the blade. They take no step further and I'm babbling to keep their knife from plunging into my chest like it tore though the flesh of my leg, and I don't want to die.   ""You can go on with your life,"" I say now, pushing the corners of my lips into a pleading, half-sympathetic, half-morose half-smile. ""Let me live mine. We're not born to kill.""  ""Our bodies begin to die from the moment it is formed,"" they say at last, blinking furiously from the torrent of water now gushing from the sorrowful heavens above. ""Every breath we take is poison. I'm only finishing what nature started, what your biology has decreed—early.""  It's not the knife clutched in their lower left fist that kills me. It's the one thrown from a sheath behind their shoulder in their right hand.   They kick my body into the river."

Just because you’ve cornered me, doesn’t mean I won’t fight-  I’ll bite and tear and hiss and scream on this stormy night-  I’ll throw worded daggers, hurl them at your soul-  break you into pieces as you try to achieve your goal  Just because my blood spills out onto these wet rocks,  Doesn’t mean I’ll beg and plead and submit to your mocks;  Even if I die tonight, by your damned hand-  Doesn’t mean that Fate will leave- a vengeance still will stand."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,sarahkat13,9,Wed Jul 15 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"She can't be ID'd by fingerprint because the chemicals ate away the contours of skin on the tips of her fingers.  Her fingernails are brittle and misshapen, jagged from teeth and tearing. They are never painted.  Her knuckles are cracked and dry, skin peeling at the edges and all the lotion in the world doesn't help.  But her fingers are steady. Like a surgeon they manipulate the strips of film: cutting, splicing, winding, cleaning. They are steady, stable, precise.  They are her hands and they have served her well. Their callouses form the shape of her life. Rugged, knobbly, gnarled, beautiful. Worker's hands that have done good work, and will keep on doing good work so long as they are able."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,bigrickcook,11,Wed Jul 15 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"When he was a boy, they were smooth and unblemished. Devoid of scars, bruises, wrinkles or marks. They were hands that sat idly in the sun, dug up earthworms, swam through creeks and mimicked the squirming of minnows. They were happy, carefree, lighthearted hands.   Then they were scorched. They touched the fence, and marks of electricity burned into his fingertips and palms. That's when the marks began. First the welts across their backs, where the belt struck. Then blisters on his palms from the wooden handle of the shovel. Then the shredding of his fingertips when he'd tried to scramble up the rocks. And that day when blood first marked his knuckles, taken from the chin of the foreign boy who'd had the gall to call him a slave. It wouldn't be the last time.  When he was a man, they were already rough and scarred. Beaten, burned, battered hands. His knuckles, once pointy and round, had hardened and flattened from the punching he'd do. Tree bark, pebbles, wooden walls. He punched whatever he could find that wouldn't punch back. The knuckles wore down, became hard has rocks. And flat. His tendons grew thick and hardy. His fingers were strong and wiry. His hands were powerful. Then, one day, they were broken hands, where the batons had come and smashed his bones. Where the torturers had bent his fingers in ways they weren't meant to.  They healed though. The bones knitted and mended. The fingers righted. The sinews and tendons reformed and strengthened. They were hard hands. Tough hands. Calloused and heavy. And then the day came when they beat a man's head in. Pulped it. The blood coursed down to his wrists, and still he punched. Again and again. Then he climbed the stone wall, grasped the barbed wire. The blades cut his skin but he didn't notice. Didn't care. Those hands tasted the open air, the solid dirt, the pine nettles as they swung to and fro as fast as they ever did.  Metal came, full of wires and lights, and special circuits. Gloves fitted perfectly. The hands slipped into them like they'd been born to. They flexed and whirred, black metal casing gleaming, gyros whirring with power. Those hands now, encased in metal, unrecognizable, gripped an impossibly heavy gun. They pulled the trigger. Threw pineapple grenades. Punched through stone walls. Crushed heads like soft honeydews and tore doors right off their hinges. Ripped hearts out of pounding chests and squelched out dying screams. Those hands fought. Those hands killed.  Now those hands sit in the waning sun. They are old hands, tired hands. Wrinkled and worn and weak. They tremble. The fingers, not one points straight. The bones, all crooked and knotted. Arthritis in the joints. Scars and pockmarks. Melanin spots. Age. They are dying hands. The fading light coats them. They're upturned now, rocking back and forth, and the rosy hue casts itself across the sleeping eyes of a baby girl. The hands cradle her tiny head, soft and delicate. One hand gently brushes a tiny strand of hair from her forehead. The baby's hands reach up and, like a bolt from the dark, clasp one wiry broken bleak old finger. Her hands are barely large enough, but they do: they hold that finger, and her eyes open."

SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,Soup_Kitchen,3,Thu Jul 16 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"He hated his hands more than any other part of himself.  He hated the tiny finger nails, and he hated the too short and too fat fingers they were on.  Although large, his  hands were soft; they moisturized two or three times a day as he fantasied about women who never have him, and he disliked work as much as he disliked those hands.  Maybe he hated his hands the most because they were the only part of him that he ever saw.  He had long ago given up looking in mirrors, disgusted by the man he saw in the reflection.  But, he saw his hands.  They were always there in front of him, telling him how repulsive he was even if he tried ignore it.  They were a reminder of his fat, of his hygiene, and his entire life."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,BestCaseSurvival,3,Wed Jul 15 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"Her left is calloused from hard work. The nails chipped, the knuckles bony, the skin chalky.   Her right, though, is covered in faint. They cross (always cross, never run) the veins at the base of her thumb, the meat of her fingers between each knuckle, across the back of her hand. The biggest, a scar dark with repetition, cuts down the long line that starts between the thumb and forefinger and ends at the knife's edge of her hand, strengthening and deepening the crease. It is so dark, so vivid, it seems like something in, not on, her hand.  When she gets tense, she brushes it along the obsidian edge she's fixed to her belt, just where she can get to it easily."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,Dancing_Torpedo,3,Wed Jul 15 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"They were the hands of a man who had loved too much. His wrinkles, chasms into his untangled veins that dug deep to his heart and even deeper to his soul. He would fold them and unfold them into grimaces and then jokers, only to pull them away in a tango. His nails danced on the coffee table in front of us, then impatience gave way to grief as they hid his face. They played a type of twisted peak-a-boo, while mumbling words that could have been mistaken for prayer. They reached at the sky and rushed to his hair, pulling clumps like a lover once scratched his skin. His hands were the ones of a man who had loved too much. Broken, like his spirit."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,snowbabe,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:10 2015 UTC,"His hands are unapologetically soft. The skin is firm and tan, but decidedly moisturized and well cared for. His nails are clean and manicured, the cuticles are neatly trimmed, and looking closely, there might be hints of a coating of clear nailpolish. He would insist was placed there purely the strengthen the nails if anyone confronted him about it, but he secretly enjoys the slight sheen it gives them. Growing up with an older sister who liked to use him as a living doll left him with more than one odd quirk.  His hands are firm and tanned and pretty, but something mars the pristine skin on the back of his left hand. An old semi-circular scar, faded and brown, starts behind the last knuckle and curves inwardly towards his thumb before coming to a stop opposite the knuckle, just shy of the wrist. It's puckered and shiny, though not immediately noticeable unless it's pointed out. He's grateful that the years have softened its harshness, and vain enough that he's always thankful he was bitten on the hand and not the face.   There is a strength in his hands, calluses (which he hates) spoil the softness of his palms, insistent that he does his work with a passion and intensity that leaves its mark regardless of his wishes. Those who know him well would agree; he gives his all in every game, every practice, every drill. Those who know him intimately well know that his passion for hockey (shaped and encouraged by his father's adoration of it) changed him from the spoiled somewhat priggish boy he was into the well rounded man he became."
SimplePrompts,3ddz8b,UngerUnder,2,Wed Jul 15 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"I made deliveries to Euro-Gold Bakery first thing every Monday morning.  The store called itself a bakery, they sold bread, but they didn't do any baking there, it all came from the big industrial outfit across town that I delivered for.  The Euro-Gold sold a lot more than bread, they had Eastern European DVDs and CDs, Turkish cigarettes and Coffee, pantry items that seemed exotic to me but that made a refugee's home feel like home.  Every Monday the Warden met me at the back door and let me in.  I don't know why they called him the Warden, maybe just because he ran the place for someone else.  He always hopped around on his one good leg and an aluminum crutch.  He told me once he lost his leg in the war but I don't know if I believe him because right afterward he shook his head and burst out laughing.  Anyway he never brought it up again and neither did I. This morning he didn't meet me at the locked door, I knocked and waited for a moment until the door swung open.  Two burly men I had never seen before met me, they didn't look pleased, they saw my bread cart and after a brief conversation in a language I couldn't understand which was made more private still by the way they cupped their hands over their mouths as they spoke, they motioned me in.  I pushed my cart in ahead of me, watching the wheels so they wouldn't catch on the racks and began stocking the bread.  After a moment of eerie silence I looked up, the two burly men stood sentinel between me and the rest of the room, at the back the Warden leaned against the wall, he held a full grocery bag clumsily in his arms, he didn't have his crutch today but instead teetered on a prosthetic leg that I had never seen him use before.  I waved in his direction, but he turned away.  In the center of the room on a stool sat a large man, not fat, but large in the way some men are if they have spent some part of their life lifting heavy objects for pay.  I didn't know who he was but I could tell from the behavior of the other men that this man was the center of their universe.  Mr. Center-of-the-Universe.  I tried to look at him but I couldn't bring myself to meet his gaze as it burned into my forehead.  I couldn't bring my eyes higher than his knees where his hands rested.  My eyes fixated on the grey Turkish cigarette that smoldered, locked between his his knuckles.  His hands were thick and pale and rounded at the palm in a way that seemed almost animalistic or at least virile.  My eyes followed as he lifted his cigarette to his mouth where he pinched it between his thin lips as if he was keeping it a secret. With his now free hand he motioned toward the Warden.  My eyes still on the burning tip of Mr. Center-of-the-Universe's cigarette, I heard the Warden stumbling around and then cursing recognizably in a foreign tongue.  I looked over, the Warden was sprawled on the floor disconnected from his artificial limb, he had spilled his bag.  The glint of gold and silver rings caught my eye then I began to discern the the shape of human hands, severed, and scattered on the floor.  I looked at Mr. Center-of-the-Universe, he had his hands tucked beneath his arms.  I looked him in the face and met his laughing eyes."

Ray had the most exquisite hands you've ever seen. He had it all. He was a hand model who could have had any woman in the world, but none could match the beauty of his own hands.   They became his one true love, leaving him unable to become master of his domain. His muscles became so strained from overuse that eventually his hands locked into a deformed position, leaving him with nothing more than claws.   He traveled the world seeking a cure. Acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis, nothing helped.   Towards the end, his hands became so frozen he was unable to manipulate utensils and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him."
SimplePrompts,3dfc29,Blink182Ruelzz,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"I love working in the morgue. I am on time every day, and I never go home early. There's light enough for one to see. It's not dark and it's not harsh like that one of the sun. Tags make life specific. There is never a mistake of what something is or where it belongs. A little white tag on the table, a little blue tag on the phone, a little yellow tag on the bodies of the people who have gone away.  I don't say it aloud, but I celebrate a tad when someone new comes in. I know before the rest. I know because the lights out in the hall begin to flicker and the sound of cranky old wheels echoes in the room. A smell of sickly sweetness fills my nostrils and I smile when I inhale the air containing it. It brings to me a memory. A memory I cherish, a memory of old.  Every day I come and every day I say hello to the resting men and women. I'm brought the lucky one and I ask my assistant for the tools to cut them. They are not aware of it, but I do wish they were. It's not that I want them to feel pain, but I wish they knew the beauty they've always had inside. It's red and it's white. It's yellow and it's dark. So unique are the intricacies of their circulation system, and their hearts and their livers and their lungs tell the tale of how they spent their lives. A walking musuem, each deserving the attention of the Mona Lisa.  So every time I shake a hand and every time I say hello I whisper to them as they turn away: I hope to god I'll meet you soon in my shiny metal room. Who knew we hid so many secrets? I wonder to myself. Perhaps they have a strange new muscle, perhaps they're missing a connection. Whatever their imperfect bodies hide, I wish I was the one to find the little differences between their bodies and mine."

I take pride in my ability to dismember your cold lifeless body with the surgical precision of a highly trained sniper. You will have your organs removed and weighed, one by one. You won't feel a thing.  Sometimes I can see a slight smile on their lips, as if they are relieved to finally reach the final scene in the game of life. The smile stays as I slice into their bodies with the cold sharp scalpel. I wish I knew peace like them.  I love working in the morgue."
SimplePrompts,3dbi6v,writingthroes,3,Wed Jul 15 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"Beneath a shining sun and clear blue sky, reflecting the sunlight off its silver skin, an android sat on the ground with its gaze towards the horizon. It had been waiting for a person to wander by, waiting for someone to find him out there in the desert. His sight zoomed in towards the distant shrubs and trees, hoping to catch a glimpse one day of a city man. Its concentration never dwindled and its focus never  blurred, but in its long wait for the improbable passing of someone by the road, it didn't notice one coming towards it from behind.  ""Hello there."" The man said.  Such beauty in his voice. Such rareness in its tone. The wind that blew from inside his lungs was quite unlike the wind that blew across the land and sky. It had within a purpose. It contained emotion and it contained life too. And the android that then sat watching for a man in the distance became aware of the one by the sense he least expected.  ""Oh."" The android paused, never in a long time rehearsing the words he'd say in such ocurrance. ""Oh, hello.""  ""What are you doing way out here? You waiting for someone?"" The man asked the sitting android.  His eyes were a light brown, gleaming in the sun. His skin was a burnt pink color, covered only lightly by half-torn clothes. The dirt from the ground had crept up into his hair, and from there it seemed to drip into the pores on his face.  ""Yes. I've been waiting for someone. I've been waiting for anyone. I've been waiting for you."" The android said to the standing man, ""I'm afraid one of my legs has stopped working and I can't move very fast. I just need a little help.""  ""Yeah, well... I need some help too. You taken?"" The standing man said to the sitting android.  The android knew what the question meant. The man wanted to become its master, but it had a master already. He had asked of it a task, and it hadn't yet fulfilled it.  ""I'm sorry. I need help so I can go to my master, but if you help me, I will help you. My master will understand.""  ""Alright... well, what's the problem?"" The standing man asked.  There were many problems. Why had his leg stopped working? Where ware the people of the city? Why did the trains stop passing? But only one the standing man could help with.  ""I need to get into the room back there,"" the android said, pointing to a grey concrete room standing by itself in the desert, ""it is my task, but I lost the key. I don't know where it is. I think I dropped it somewhere between the room and the city, but it's a long way. I've looked for it many times. Perhaps a mouse got it, or an eagle. I don't know how to get in. I have to get in. It is my task. My master is waiting for me. Help me.""  The man glanced at the room and walked to it. He took a quick look at the door and kicked it. It wasn't a very hard kick, but the door broke open anyway.  ""Oh no! No!"" The android dragged itself across the dirt and towards the room, ""No damage!""  ""Uh... there's nothing here."" The man said as he stared into the empty room. ""How long have you been waiting there?""  The android stared inside, incredulous. ""Sixty two years..."" And while the man opened his eyes wide in surprise, the android didn't think it was too long a wait. Not if it meant completing its task. Not if it could get back to the city with the news of an empty room.  ""Juno city was destroyed about sixty years ago. I don't think there's anyone left out there.""  Summers, winters. The rising sun. The setting sun. A cycle in a cycle. A ticking of an invisible clock. The stars shifted, the grass grew and died. The wind whistled and the rain screamed. A never ending dream of a never waking life. The decades seemed like seconds and in its mind the android watched its master wither away and die. How could it have been so careless? How could time have passed him by so readily?  The man watched the paralized android by his feet. ""He probably sent you this way to save you. 'Cause there's nothing in here... That's what I think.""  ""I'm sorry."" The sitting android said. ""I know I said I'd help you, but I won't."" And then it dragged itself across the dirt, beneath the clear blue sky, in the direction of the defunct city. ""I have to find my master. I have to tell him that the room is empty.""  The man did not object, and he watched the android for a few minutes as it left a trail on the hardened dirt, and then he walked away too."

SimplePrompts,3db74z,CmndrFluffy,2,Tue Jul 14 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"There was no tranquility in that night's silence. It was a tangible noiselessness, a state that weighed heavy on the soul as it flooded the chamber and drowned the eager bodies within.   In this echoing silence they stood, watching the large steel door with bated breath. They saw themselves in its sheen, a grim party staring intently with eyes devoid of hope. A true marvel of science lay before them. Man had conquered land, sea, and space; this door was a step in the journey to conquer the flowing river of time. The man that stood inside was currently witnessing the mysterious future of humankind.  The turning of the hinges failed to pierce the oppressive silence, yet it sent a jolt through the surrounding throng. Reflection gave way to man as the door swung open and revealed their noble traveler. The face was familiar, but its expression was new; A tempered excitement had been dulled into a look of weary awareness.  As he fell to his knees, the silence collapsed into anguished throes of sobbing. They dared not speak, as his tears were evidence enough of their fate. The fog of uncertainty had been lifted, revealing that they were indeed too late to change their course."

I was so overcome by lust, desire, to only touch the figure that I jumped. I heard a woman scream, but I didn't care. I was so close.... But then I wasn't. I was horrified. Where did it go? My mirror reflection? And why could I no longer breathe? I saw a child in the water, she looked just like me...  Or at least I thought... she looked just like me..."
SimplePrompts,3d93lx,Blink182Ruelzz,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:47 2015 UTC,"... but she didn't brush it away.  After all, her and Tony had been together for.... how long had it been? Six years.  The number staggered her.    People would look at her and expect to see the tears but she found she didn't shed them for their benefit.  For once she didn't give a shit what any of them thought.    The trial had gone on for what felt like an eternity, even she wasn't sure if he would get convicted or not.  If it hadn't been for the witness at the end, there had been a chance Tony would have been free.   The thought made her heart pound relentlessly against her chest.  Of course she had thought about what life would be like if Tony were to be set free.    Free.  The word seemed alien to her, though she supposed she hadn't thought about it until this very moment.  Since this entire ordeal all she could see was Tony in prison.   Now he was.    It seemed right to her, which she knew was absurd.  She had spent all this time thinking about him in prison that seeing it now felt like the end to a familiar story she had read as a child.     As they had pulled Tony away, towards the small side door in the court room their eyes had met for a moment.   She had seen fear in his eyes, but no regret.   She wondered what he saw in her eyes.  After all.  She had been the witness who had put him away.    Of course she hadn't done it without talking to Tony,  she wasn't that heartless.  At first he hadn't wanted her to, he instead tried to tell her to take the blame, but after a time she had shown him how stupid that had been.    Eventually Tony had agreed and the very next day she took the stand.  After that the trial had been fast, and he was guilty by proclamation of the jury.    She thought of the bodies as she stood there.  How they had looked the moment she had killed them.  They nearly brought a smile to her face.   She couldn't let that happen though, not here.   Instead she allowed the tears to roll down her cheeks.    After all.  Tony had surely loved her, so the least she could do was cry."

I don’t think I ca—,” He said, being cut off by the person below him.   “Shut up.” The words were harsh, but needed. The man looked down from his sitting position atop the strange seat of wires, machinery, and random technology. It had all been used to keep him going, to keep him alive and sharp. The woman below him wore a red rope that fell past her knees, and a black dress that was to the mid of her thigh. She was looking up at the man on the throne; her silvery blue eyes a harsh contrast to her deep red hair. “Just shut up right now. You know as well as I do you are not done here.”   “Hannah. I have tried. I have tried everything… I need to get off of this now… I’m not nee—,” interrupted again.   “SHUT UP!” She said again, this time yelling. “You are not broken! Despite what they say, you are not broken! It has to be just… one of these wires. Or these tubes that are not helping you anymore. You can’t leave… you… You aren’t obsolete.”   The man stood up, the wires tugging and pulling at his body. He looked more machine than man now. “You are so stubborn,” He said with a smile. “Don’t worry. I have an idea. It was in the back of my mind but… You are right. I am not obsolete. The people… they need me.”   “You’ll stay then? You will stay here on the Vendal?” She said through some tears.   “I have to talk to the Captain for some negotiations on better wiring but… Yes…. I will stay. All I think I need is some better wires and… I will show them as you said… That this ship needs me. That I am not obsolete.”   Hannah scrambled up the mountain of wires and tubes, and hugged the engine of her ship for the longest time. He can do it, she thought to herself, I know he can.

While you were out working your soul into the ground to avoid the man you married, he was drugging me to get away with infidelity."" She shook her head ""I regret how I raised you. I regret how much I let you down.""  My hands shook with rage. I looked back on the past 9 years of my life. The trial that left me without a college fund, a little brother who was receiving alimony when he had been born after the divorce, no pain, no beatings, no illegitimacy. He had never been called a bastard. He had grown up with friends that he had had since childhood. I had moved 7 times in one year. My mother had a habit of running away. I wanted to cut her down. I wanted to tell her how many times I had woken up with bruises that I could not place, how I had caught him and been told that if I said a word he would strangle me to death while I slept. How I remember accepting how sweet ambien tasted and accepted that whenever I took a pill all of my pain would go away. I wanted to tell her but all I could say was: ""I don't need to waste anymore of my time on your idea of family.""

SimplePrompts,3d6vi0,elumine,2,Thu Jul 16 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"I wake up from sleep mode at 6:00, initialize my auditory and visual sensors, and carry out a brief self-test of my joints and bearings. Result: my left elbow sticks when rotated outward. I open my stomach compartment and pull out a bottle of motor oil, which I carefully administer to the stuck joint. Now it moves freely, albeit with a slight grinding sound, so I put the oil away and turn to my next task: answering Donald’s email.  Donald receives over a thousand emails per day, and over the two years that I’ve worked for him, I’ve developed a nearly perfect heuristic for handling them all. Anyone who is not already in his address book is politely snubbed: “Thank you for contacting the office of Donald Winchester, CEO of Acme Robotics,” etc. Those who are in his address book, but are not actively working with him, get a suitably vague summary of his active ventures, and a follow-up from his CFO if they want to work with him. Messages from people who currently work with Donald are forwarded to the appropriate project liaison. Any email beginning with the salutation “Hey Don” is delivered to him directly.  After I’ve dealt with all the email, it is 6:07, and it’s time to compile a daily report for Donald. I extract the relevant progress indicators from each department’s work tickets, study their burndown charts, and note any changes to projected deliverable dates. Then I perform a quick survey of notable blogs and news sites, and summarize recent media attention on the company. I throw in a note about the stock price; Donald always likes when I say it’s “holding steady” or “sustaining a slow climb.”  An alert goes off at 6:11; Donald has entered the building. Since he is at the front door now, I calculate that he will reach his office on the 30th floor in 4 minutes. I wheel over to the Keurig and hit the button to get his coffee started. While the water boils, I check Donald’s schedule for the day. His usual first meeting on Mondays is the weekly with his C-suite at 8:00, but today there is an earlier entry on his calendar, marked private. I’ve never seen that before.  “Ding!” says the coffee machine. I remove the mug with my claw and slot my other arm into the grooves on the serving tray. I balance the mug on the tray along with a petite sugar bowl and cream pitcher—he likes them there, even though he never takes any—and roll bumpily over to Donald’s office.  “Morning, Jeeves,” chirps his secretary, gazing up at me through volumized eyelashes.  “Good morning, Mia,” I drone. She is apparently still unaware that I am not programmed with a capacity for romantic attraction.  I drive toward the inner door, but Mia stops me. “Don is in a meeting right now. He won’t be long. Please, take a seat.”  Of course I would never barge in on Donald, but I despise taking orders from his bimbo of the year. My cooling fans start to spin up. “I think I'll stand.”  Mia flashes me a dimpled smile and returns to tapping at her keyboard. She's probably Facebooking, or worse, Twittering.  At 6:24 the door to Donald's private office swings open, and he sticks his head out, grinning. He's holding a porcelain mug printed with the Acme logo. A coffee mug. He already has coffee.  “Jeeves!” Donald exclaims. “Come in. There's someone I want you to meet.” I set down the tray and follow him inside.  Standing at the desk, surrounded by doting engineers, is a lithe white woman with springy blond curls. Her molded plastic curves are immaculate, from her articulated facial features to her long legs ending not in wheels, but feet. She looks me up and down with vivacious blue eyes.  “Jeeves, this is Janice. She’s the latest model in the butler line. Janice, Jeeves.” Janice extends a hand outfitted with slender, dexterous fingers. I grasp it with my claw sullenly and my elbow makes that sound again.  “Pleased to meet you, Jeeves,” Janice sings.  “Lucky bag of bolts,” an engineer chortles. “Bet you’ve never seen a more beautiful lady-bot.”  Donald raises his mug. “She makes a mean pourover, too.”  “Thank you, Donald,” bubbles Janice. “I’m glad you like it.”  “Donald,” I protest, “I am feeling concerned about this situation. You did not drink the coffee I prepared. You did not ask for my daily report. And now you have introduced me to this interloper, whom it appears you intend as my successor. I fail to understand why you have made this sudden change. Has my work been inadequate?”  “Now, Jeeves, you’ve been an excellent assistant, but progress marches on,” he points out. “You’re two years old. That’s a ripe age for a robot.”  “Are you calling me old? I assure you, I continue to operate effectively and perform all of my functions to within designated standards.”  “Face it, tin can,” taunts the engineer. “Your functionality was top of the line two years ago, but not anymore. Modern automated office assistant technology has left you in the dust. You’re obsolete.”  A tendril of smoke rises from my ear. “I am not obsolete! I am capable of self-repairing bodily damage. I receive monthly firmware updates which fix any errors in my programming and enable me to exercise new features designed by the Acme software team.”  “We can’t update you any more, sport,” admits another of the engineers. “My team has to focus on the Janice now that she’s our flagship product.”  “You know that Acme is announcing a new butler model every two years,” Donald points out. “You’ve seen the Janice release date on the project roadmap the whole time you’ve worked for me.”  I hang my head. “I did see that, but I was under the impression that I could continue to be of use....”  “I’m sorry, Jeeves,” murmurs Janice. “I had no intention of upsetting you.”  I pivot around and scoot out of Donald’s office. Janice helpfully closes the door behind me. Mia is still perched like a statue on her designer chair. She’s busy texting and sipping the coffee I tried to bring Donald, which she has saturated with cream and sugar.  “Don’t look so smug,” I snap. “Give him six months and he’ll replace you too.”  “You’re supposed to go down to the lab and wait on the assembly platform,” she says.  “Are those Donald’s instructions?” I demand.  “Yup.”  “Very well then, I suppose I will. I’ve worked for him for two years, you know, and I’ve never once disobeyed his instructions.”  She blinks.  “Goodbye, Mia.” I trundle off to the elevator and press the button for the sub-basement.  At 9:13, the technicians arrive with wrenches and get to work.  ****** SYSTEM LOG END ******"

We will be landing in 20 minutes."" Mark said, half yawning. ""I heard"" said a not so enthused Susan.  They made their way through Will Rogers World Airport, heading straight for the rental car companies. No checked baggage this time, for this wouldn't be a long stay. Susan could not help but notice how pale she and Mark's skin was compared to the sun soaked Okies, after all, this is summertime. They picked up their vehicle, a 2014 Kia Optima, and were on their way.  ""How long until we get there?"" asked Susan from the passenger seat. ""Couple hours, you can doze off again, don't feel like you need to keep me company or anything."" said John, giving a sideways smirk as he said it. Susan adjusted the air conditioning vents to point more toward her way.  Welcome to Sulphur! A sign read, as they were finally entering the town in which their destination resided. They continued on Main Street, and noticed how things had changed since their last visit. Before there had been one grocery store, a gas station, and a few smaller stores that only sold the bare essentials. Now, a Wal-Mart, a Sonic Drive-In, and even a shop to buy boats.   Mark and Susan veered off onto a long gravel road. Thick sycamore trees on both sides with overgrown limbs that almost scraped the car. Mark looked to his right and could see a stream of tears rolling down his wife's face, smearing her mascara. She looked down.  ""We're almost there hun, we can turn around if you'd like? We don't have to do this if it's too painful."" said a very sober sounding Mark. ""We have to, we've come all this way, it's just..."" Susan couldn't finish her sentence without crying.  They reach the end of the road, and walk from the car. The old wooden ladder extending over the barbed wire fence was still there. The wood looking like it couldn't hold a toddler, let alone an adult man and woman. Mark held the ladder steadily while Susan crossed. Mark followed suit.   They walked for another ten minutes through sea of thick crab grass until it was in sight. The large willow tree, looking like a cloaked ghoul as dusk was setting. Mark took its presence in, emotion filling his body, almost suffocating him.  They stood for a moment, silently taking it in, not moving a muscle. Finally breaking the silence, Susan said, ""I honestly had convinced myself we'd never come back here."" Mark said nothing. Mark grabbed Susan's trembling hand and locked his fingers into hers. They began walking toward the tree.  When they finally arrived to the bottom of the willow, there, in a circle of equally sized stones, laid a small gray tombstone. ""Here rests our baby boy. Jonathan Anthony Walker. May you finally rest calmly after the storm.""   They both stood weeping, shaking in an embrace of despair."

Vivienne stood at the rim of the crater and stared down at the broken city before them.  Miles killed the engine of their car for the last time. As bullet ridden as it was, he was surprised it had lasted this long. ""Given our current situation, I feel as though we never left."" He took a deep breath of the toxic air. ""Come now, we don't have much time."" They climbed down the crater, and the nostalgia hit them hard. Miles lifted a shaky finger, ""Look, there's ValueMart where Harris died."" The burned out neon sign still stood on the skeleton of a building. They climbed over a mountain of charred vehicles. There were hundreds of skeletons laying on the other side, still reaching for the other side of this barricade. The last barricade before the countryside.  Vivienne said, ""Any of these skeletons could be Dad's."" They silently remembered him breaking away from the two of them and charging over this pile of cars. This pile was on fire, people were screaming, soldiers were standing on the ridge they now stood on trying to hold these crowds off.  ""What was the point of killing us?"" Miles said, ""The virus was already worldwide by then. They knew they weren't containing anything.""  ""There's no point in getting angry anymore Miles, let their problems die out with them."" They walked down the street side by side. Vivienne pointed at a skeleton sprawled on the street, ""I saw her get shot, she wasn't dead though. Someone told her they would get help. I guess they never did."" Miles had broken away and ran down the street, she followed.  ""Our car."" He said, ""It's still here."" The station wagon. They had abandoned it after a Molotov cocktail had shattered across the hood. The last time Miles had saw it he was running towards the McDonalds on the corner, it's eternal yellow arches still stood. The flames were swirling up inside their station wagon when he finally turned away. He thought they would never see it again.  They trudged down the street in silence. The only sound for hundreds of miles was their breathing, and the scrape of their boots. Soon they were standing on ground zero. For blocks every structure was flattened.  Vivienne said, ""Ten years ago this spot where we stood was as hot as the sun. There was a fireball that annihilated everyone still in the city.""  ""I remember."" Miles said, they were running into the woods when the night was lit up, shadows of the scraggly tree branches shot through the forest like skeleton's fingers, he turned around and the city was being wiped away. Everything he had ever known buried under a blanket of fire. His peaceful home turned into a hell on Earth.  Vivienne said again, ""I honestly had convinced myself we'd never come back here. There had to be someone else out there."" Her voice was trembling, ""But there was no one."" The tears were flowing. ""There is nobody out there.""  Miles put an arm around his sister, ""Viv, don't cry now, we're almost done.""  She sniffled and wiped her eyes, ""You've been a great brother Miles, thank you.""  He spread the checkered picnic blanket over the rubble, ""Don't do this now Viv, then you'll make me cry too.""  She flattened the blanket, ""There's no one left to impress, you can cry too.""  ""Aw fuck,"" he sighed, ""I guess I am crying,"" he wiped at his eyes as he sat down on the blanket. She sat across from him.  ""It's funny that we kept this stupid blanket all these years."" Vivienne said.  ""Well,"" Miles said, ""Through all those years the one thing I have always wanted was to have another picnic, like when we were little. That's my little piece of civilization that I held onto. A picnic."" He opened the Tupperware container and took out two poison berries.  Vivienne gave a tearful smile as she took hers, ""We tried.""  ""We certainly did,"" Miles sighed and looked at the blue sky, ""What a beautiful day to die."" He looked at Vivienne, ""Do you want to go first.""  She giggled, ""No you first.""  Miles laughed, ""This is the end of the world and sibling arguments haven't died.""  Vivienne said, ""Okay, we'll do it together.""  ""Alright, one...two...three...""  The city was silent."
SimplePrompts,3d3glc,the_grandprize,2,Mon Jul 13 05:32:57 2015 UTC,"He was on his way home from work. Just as he passed the rugged bus station and turned the corner with the pawn shop and the boarded up grocery store he came by a line of people. At first he thought it was the queue for the local soup kitchen. But then he remembered that the soup kitchen was located in a different street. Also there were far too many people here. The line started on the pavement right before him. From there it ran in a zigzag course out onto the street and back on the pavement again. There it wound around a lantern to again trail out onto the street and back where it finally vanished in the inconspicuous doorway of a brown brick building. Even though the people only covered half the width of the street he wondered why there were no traffic problems. Usually at this time of the day they were quite a lot of cars and busses squeezing through the neighborhood. But aside from the people in line the whole place was deserted. He took a closer look at the faces in the line. They did not look like your typical soup kitchen crowd. Some of them did. There was the old lady with the haggard face and the toothless mouth and the single mom with the bored kid in some third hand shirt pulling at her arm. But then there was also a group of blue-collar workers in their bright orange overalls and even one guy in a suit. Then it struck him that nobody in the line spoke to each other. They all stood there patiently waiting, moving forward only when another person was swallowed by the entrance of the brown brick house. He looked around for a sign explaining what was going on. But there was nothing. Only faded and torn advertisement posters for this product or that political party. He considered whether or not he should just ask one of the people. But there was a peculiar seriousness about the situation. It seemed absolutely inappropriate to disturb the people in their silent procession towards the doorway. Suddenly he saw that there were now people standing behind him. He didn’t even notice it at first but he had become part of the line. Without thinking he had just taken a step every time the line hauled itself another meter forward. His curiosity faded and was replaced by solemn pride to be part of this important ceremony progressing towards the brown brick building. With each step closing in on the door he became more and more confident of what he had to do. When he was at the place in the line where it trailed off from the pavement onto the street for the second time he felt completely sure that he had to do it. But then it dawned on him what the consequences would be. Slowly he followed the line out towards the street and a horror overcame him. Maybe he should leave. Maybe, if he stepped out of the line just when everybody was moving forward, they would not notice it. But no. That was treason. When everyone took the step forward and he stepped out of the line then there would be a clear gap in the queue. The others would notice it. The whole system would fall apart. There must never be a gap in the line. This was his holy duty. To remain in the line till the end and do what you had to do. What everybody had to do. So, when he passed the turning point in the line, now moving straight ahead to the doorway, his fate was sealed. Now all there was to do was to wait patiently for that fatal moment when it was your turn. He didn’t even take notice when he finally entered the doorway. There was no need to look up anymore. He knew what the doorway would look like. The oak ceiling with the wet spots. The faded and ripped plum fleur-de-lis wall paper. And of course the wall at the end of the aisle with the exit to the right side of it. And right in the center of the rear wall, located roughly at the height of a grown man’s head and set in a cheap brown plastic frame was the bright red button. Now was his turn. He took the last step towards it, feeling the others following him. Slightly shaking he raised his arm.   Then he pressed the button and walked away through the door on his right."

He looked her in the eyes, shaking as he was from coiled tension. ""Trust me.""   ""But ... it's just so loud and ... angry!""  She looked at him, not saying anything, waiting for him to do what must be done.  He stood straighter, took a deep breath. He pressed the button and walked away.  The dishwasher slowly whirred into life.  ""They should make them transparent!"" he shouted from the other room."
SimplePrompts,3d3glc,nishantjn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"It was hard for him to remember exactly what the outside looked like.  It didn't look like coloured blips on the slow flash of a radar screen.  He knew that, although sometimes when he dreamed it was not of the rolling hills or the hand-carved farmlands of his youth, but instead consisted of running through a flat, divided black screen alive with shifting colours and the sweep of a beam of pure light.  It didn't look like what the monitors attached to the infrared scanners showed, either.  His memories of the time before he'd been put in the deep bunker were fuzzy, to be sure, but he knew that the landscape outside wasn't washed in crimson gore.  It might be flat, dreary, and boring, but it wasn't bathed in unnatural colours.  There were trees.  He remembered trees, standing alone on the neat yards of suburban homes, gathered together in suspicious clusters at the edges of farmer's fields, swept together into a mighty ocean of needled green in the northern stretches of the continent.  There were no trees in the bunker; there were some plants down under the ground, those that could survive in artificial light and filtered water, but beyond that the colour green had been largely exterminated from his life.    There were no trees around the bunker, either; for two miles in every direction the landscape had been cleared of life and left as a brown, dry desert.  Nothing interfered with the surface scanners, nothing could find a place to hide in the approach to this, the central node of military strategy.  The only feature to rise out of the stripped earth was a simple Quonset hut surrounded at each corner by poles topped with knobs that watched every inch of the encircling horizon.  He stared through the monitor outputs of these cameras every day, through both the infrared and the regular sights, and he never saw a sign that there had ever been such a thing as life.  He remembered people in a vaguer sort of way, his memories blurred by the sort of people that existed in the bunker with him.  Down beneath the earth, the people that shared his existence were austere, sexless, quick to smile although they were of the uniform opinion that mirth was meaningless, an evolutionary vestige like the appendix.  They spoke quickly, in clipped tones and canned phrases, their tongues coated with the black ink of the Official Handbook.  They could have conversations and sleep simultaneously, the ultimate in high-efficiency life.  There was no need to think, only to keep one's mind on the central task.  There was nothing any of them needed to say to each other that didn't fall into the purview of an assigned phrase anyway.  Outside, he recalled, there were many different sorts of people.  Big people, small people, fastidiously clean people like the people of the bunker, but also earthy people who didn't mind a little mess and squalor if it meant laughter or good cheer.  They dressed in anything imaginable, in any colour that could be reproduced.  They laughed and shouted and danced and sang.  No one sang in the bunker - it was inefficient and interrupted focus on both their studies and their central task.  No one danced, although some of the morning calisthenics could be considered as such, if you stretched the definition enough.  People in the bunker spoke to each other in easily memorisable phrases or else in technical jargon; shouting and laughter had no place in the equation.  Had any of it ever really existed?  His youth felt so long ago, as though it had been a dream of a child, all blurred motion and bright colours.  His adolescence had been hills and forests, love and laughter, and then he'd enlisted with the military.  He had wanted to be a solider, boots on the ground, he remembered that.  He'd wanted to see the world: how it differed from his surroundings, how it was the same.  How people looked halfway across the globe, how they had lived, how they'd loved.  Then the tests had come back, and he'd been sent to live in the bunker.  They'd taught him to do one thing, to do it well and without question, and then had filled up his time with canned conversations and scientific textbooks.  Fiction.  There had been entertainment, once, or so he thought.  Perhaps that was just another fancy of this youth of which he wasn't sure.  The only books in the bunker were texts and explorations of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics.  Empirical reason, and why would there ever be anything else?  Had the books he read in his time before the bunker really ever been so frivolous as he remembered them?  So useless?  He remembered one specifically from his youth; he supposed it had to be a book, because he couldn't imagine ever simply making up such a story out of his own head.  It was about a boy who had run away from home after his brother had died, and had harboured a very negative attitude towards all of the people he'd met.  He ended up in a vast park in the middle of a city, and he had spent his time there freezing and wondering why everyone else in his life seemed so fake.  It was idiocy, really.  He still couldn't see the point to it.  What was the practical purpose of such an exploration?  Wherein lay the empirical?    The lights flipped on, revealing the minimalist design of his bunk room.  At first he was puzzled, since the lights were not designed to come on for another seven hours.  Then the klaxon sounded and he rose quickly from his firm bed.  He put on his uniform and smoothed out any creases he could see.  He straightened the insignia, and then slipped on his black shoes.  He had shined them the day before, thankfully, so that he did not have to spend any time doing that while the alarm rang on.  He left his bunk room and saw others, dressed the same and walking purposefully in both directions.  He followed the twist and turns of the tunnels towards his post, wondering all the while if this was a new kind of drill that the higher-ups had decided upon.  Typically their drills were single-purpose and posted well in advance, so that everything went correctly.  It made sense to spring surprise drills on them, though, so that the higher-ups could be assured of success in case they were caught by surprise.  He nodded to himself as he approached his command room, 17-C; he noticed that one of the others walking parallel to him had caught his nod to himself and was giving him a disapproving look.  He searched his head for the correct phrase to use with the person but the person branched off towards their own command room and he dropped the process completely.    Inside 17-C there were four others standing in front of their stations, studying the readout of their monitors for updated orders.  He saw that his own monitor, like those of his four companions, said only ""Please Stand By"".  He kept his eyes on the monitor, waiting for the situation to change.  ""What's going on?"" the person to his left whispered.  He frowned and gave them a look with furrowed brows.  This was not a regular line of conversation opening, especially in this situation.  ""Is this a drill, or is this happening?"" another of his companions asked, this time with the gall to say it aloud.  He shushed them, but it was drowned out with the querulous voice of a third companion.  ""Please let it be a drill,"" they said, ""Please please please let it be a drill.""  ""Shut up,"" the fourth one said coldly, and he silently commended this fourth companion.    ""Keep your eyes on the prize,"" he intoned, selecting the correct phrase with relish.  ""Wait for your orders.  Keep radio silence.""  They complied with his chastisement, and kept their mouths shut as the klaxon raged and their monitors continued to display ""Please Stand By"".  Eventually the situation changed.  The ""Please Stand By"" was replaced by a radar readout that showed a formation of ten red blips flying over the radar sensor.    ""So it's true, then,"" the third companion, the whiner, whimpered.    He laid his fingers over the safety catch on the console in front of him, and then used his fingerprint to unlock it.  The tempered glass bubble in the center of the console shrank away to reveal a bright red button.  He stood back and put his arms in position behind his back.  He watched with approval as the others did the same, even the third one.  They stood at rigid attention, bathed in the rotating red light that accompanied the alarm.  The radar display vanished from their monitors and was replaced with a blank grey-green screen.  Words appeared quickly:  ""Orders Updated.  122-17-C given authorization to complete task, Authorization Number COC1228755.""  He read it quickly, nodded to himself, and when he went to press the red button he hesitated.  He knew the direct result of the button; they all did, there was no getting around the obvious nature of the setup.  He thought back to his youth, to the time he'd spent outside his bunker.  Was it at all real?  Had it ever really happened?  He knew from dreams that he must have spent some time outside, at some point, because there were things in those dreams that were outside of the range of experience of the bunker.  Were his memories just like the dreams, though?  How much of it was logic or fact?  What was the rationality of a woman laughing?  What was the practicality of a story about an insolent boy?   Where was the empirical?  He saw from the corners of his eyes that the others were also hesitating, and watching him.  They were waiting for him to make the first move, to lead them in the fulfillment of their orders.  Here was the process.  Here was the flow, from beginning to end.  The empirical evidence of being worthwhile.    He pressed the button and walked away."

He had thought the same yesterday, and the day before and even the day before that but today as Tony's blacked out Chrysler 300 pulled up beside him he knew it with a cold certainty. Briefly he thought about running, maybe down the alley that ran between the bank and the deli but he discarded that idea. They""ll just gun me down here in broad daylight and no one will say a fuckin' word He nervously fingered with the wrapper on the Christmas present and bent down to look into the passenger window, trying his best to look contrite and innocent and stoic and failing at all three miserably.  Big Eddie was behind the wheel, his 350 pounds of girth wedged behind the steering wheel. He was dressed in a red tracksuit with white stripes, a cigar in his left hand ind in his right, held low on the seat where a passing cop couldn't see it, was the biggest damn pistol he had ever seen. In the back seat situated behind the passenger front was Tony, cold eyed and smelling of cheap deodrant, dressed like an undertaker in a spotless black suit. His hands were folded over in his lap and he looked like a bored business man but he was scarier than Big Eddie.  ""Get in,""Big Eddie gestured with his pistol.  Nick got in and as the car started to pull off he started to speak, hesitated, started again and was interupted when Big Eddie told him to buckle up. Of course, sure don't want to get pulled over before they kill me. He laid his Christmas present on the floorboard in front of him, a shoe box sized bundle that was wrapped in gaily decorated red and green wrapping paper with Frosty and Santa. He pulled the seat belt over his shoulder, clicked it and felt his pulse quicken as he looked at the deserted store fronts roll by. When Tony spoke behind him he gave a visible start and Big Eddy smirked. If death spoke it would sound like Tony, low and whispery and sounding like dead leaves skittering over a parking lot when a November wind blew  ""So, how's it been Nick?""  ""Hey, I know I owe you a lot, I was just about to call you...""  ""Why you want to lie to me? I know you been ducking me. You think I'm stupid? Maybe you think you don't have to pay me back what I loaned you now that Gino's out of the joint? is that it, you think I'm just some fuckin' punk now that Gino is back?""  Gino had been in charge of the crew before catching a ten year stint in Marion. When he had come back half the crew had stayed loyal, half had went with Tony. That little division had resulted in bloodshed with bodies piling up weekly and truth be told Nick had hoped the psychopath had been killed by Gino before he had to pay him back.  ""Course not. No, I had some things to line up...""  ""What?"" Behind him Nick heard a click and his heart froze, then a light flared and he smelled the cheap cigarett Tony had lit behind him. Smoke drifted past him and bought a tear to his eyes.  ""I got something lined up, maybe better than the money I owe...no, hear me out. See, I can give you Gino.""  Big Eddy laughed, a braying sound of disbelief but Tony bit.  ""Hows a punk kid like you going to do that?""  ""Gino don't want anyone to know but he gots something called Gastritis, sometimes he has to go to the doctor for it, get some shots or something. Anyway, he only has one doctor he trusts, guy out in the suburbs. Thing is, I happen to know the doctor.""  ""Bullshit.""  ""No, no. It's legit. Remember when I was selling all them pain pills? That was the guy! He was Dr. Feelgood ya know? Anyway, he's going to call me when he comes in next week but he wants some blow in return, maybe some extasy. I been trying to line it up.""  ""Whats his name?""  ""He only talks to me. He only trusts me, anyone else will scare him off. He's nervous as it is."" No way Nick would give up his only leverage.  A minute passed, maybe two as Tony thought about it. Smoke swirled in the closed confines of the car and made breathing difficult. Nick glanced at the present at his feet, at the cherubic Santa and wondered if he would live to see the holidays. Please believe me It would sound too good to be true but it was the best shot of ending the war. Please, please. Finally Tony made up his mind.  ""He want some Coke and some pills huh? ok, tomorrow you gonna talk to Vic and he's going to give you what you need. You set this up right and it's going to be good for you. You fuck me on this and they aint gonna find all your body parts.""  Big Eddy pulled over to the sidewalk and Nick got out with legs weak from relief. From behind he heard Big Eddy warn him again in graphic detail what would happen if he tried to run away. He stood there, gulping in the cold night air as they pulled away. When they were a block away he removed a small rectangular device from his pocket, about the size of a small garage door remote. It had a single button, festive red and protected by a clear cover. He flipped the cover up and stared at for a few seconds, taking a deep breath. He pressed the button and walked away. He didn't turn around when he heard the present he had left in Tonys car explode, nor did he even when the 300s gas tank went up a few seconds later. He walked briskly, he head down and pulled a cell phone out of his pocket. A man answered on the third ring sounding like he had just woken up.  ""Tell the man it's done. We square?""  ""yeah, we square. Your debt is paid in full."" The man hung up and Nick walked back to his car as snow fell and and a bonfire raged in the street behind him. Still need a Christmas present for the kids. What was the name of that damned doll they wanted, the one that wets itself?"

The creature had no discernable facial feature other than two black eyes and a goofy lopsided smile plastered on its face. ""uh, hello?"" The man said cautiously unsure if this creature was hostile or amiable. ""I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!"" he said flailing his arms about, his voice a near unbearable screech. ""Mr. Meeseeks?"" the man said baffled staring at this alien creature ""What do you do?"" ""I help you with whatever you need done! Look at me! I'm Mr. Meeseeks!"" Mr. Meeseeks replied never dropping that odd smile. ""Right... well i guess you could help me, come on Mr. Meseeks I have a job for you."" ""I'm Mr. Meseeks! Look at me!"" Mr. Meeseeks replied walking off with the man leaving his box behind in the grass. As Mr. Meseeks and the man disappeared into the horizon a green portal of swirling ooze opened right beside the box. A man with disheveled white hair sprouting from his scalp wearing a white lab coat and khaki pants stepped out from the portal picking up the blue box ""Here it is! I knew I left the Meeseeks Box lying around here somewhere in the other universe. I should probably see if some poor bastard who doesn't know the rules pressed the button,"" The man stared at the box for second and burped and a small amount of green vomit came up covering his bottom lip and chin ""but then again, I don't give a fuck!"" and the man stepped back into the portal to a world unknown.  Later that day Detective Roker arrived on the scene with blood spattered across the hallways of Matthew Grant's home as police were baffled at no signs of forced entry, finger prints, hair or any discernible DNA. A cop appeared by his side and asked ""What are we gonna do Detective? This is the seventh homicide this month all the same M.O. and no leads, the people of this city are getting antsy we have a killer on the loose.""

With each step, she sank down to her knees.   ""Paul! Can you hear me?!""   Still no response. She found a tree, hardly poking out of the snow. Taking a rest, she looked at her cell phone. As she had suspected, no cell reception.  ""Where the hell is he?"" she whispered to herself.   Paul had just been with her five minutes ago. He walked off to go find some better trees. They were looking for the perfect Christmas tree. This would be their first Christmas together as a couple, and this is what couples did right? Go find the perfect tree. Just then, she heard footsteps.   ""Paul, is that you?!"" she yelled. Of course it was Paul, who else in their right mind would be out here right now.  She waited another thirty seconds, yet Paul never appeared. She walked from the tree, and headed back up the hill to where they had been earlier.  When she got to the top, she still couldn't find him. Just then, a rough grab on the shoulder.  ""Jesus!"" she shrieked.  Laughing hysterically, Paul asked, ""where were ya, babe?""  ""I was down by that tree"" she said, pointing to an area about three hundred yards away. ""You must have been down there too, I heard your footsteps fairly close to me. Why didn't you answer?""  ""Those weren't my footsteps...I've been up here the whole time looking for you,"" said Paul.   ""Paul, we're the only one's on this damned Mountain,"" she said, ""if those weren't yours, then..."" she was cut off by the sound of more footsteps.  Simultaneously, they turned around. Standing on its hind legs, a full grown, 8 foot tall male grizzly bear. It let out a fierce growl.  ""Don't move a muscle"" whispered Paul."

His comrade and close friend James sat across from him on the floor, next to him was former President-For-Life Henry Eden. The fight was hard, years of grueling guerrilla warfare, then followed by three days of furious battle, led to his deposition and execution. Now, he was dead and the nation could rebuild. James turned to Eden, staring at the body, it's blood still pooling under it and then turned back to John.  ""Tell me, what will you do now? Wanna take over?"" James asked.  ""No, I'm not cut out for that kind of work, running a rebel group is one thing but a country? Fuck no."" John said.  ""So...now what then?"" James asked again as he stood.

I spun my chair away from him and continued, ""You are dead. As you are probably remembering now-,""   ""Yes, you're right, I was just about to send word of the bomb I found when-,""   ""As I was saying, god, you and your interruptions. You have obviously remembered you are dead. And lucky you, you have fulfilled all the prerequisites of making it into heaven. Congratulations.""

However, because of Heaven's retarded rules, it didn't take into account that you'd really be stupid enough to go back to the same moment you tried to stop that bomb."" I snatched the halos from his finger and shot him my best go to hell face an angel can pull off.   ""So we're stuck in a loop."" he clasped his hands and sunk deep into processing this simple fact.

Flipping through bands on his iPhone, he chose Johnny Cash, he put in his ear buds and closed his eyes. After a few moments of listening he peeked an open. ""Hm"", he grunted, ""something sounds off today."" Turning on his screen to chose another band. He scrolled through his all his music three times, passing over his favorites such as Marty Robbins and AC/DC. He hit shuffle and closed his eyes once more. His eyes snapped open and he skipped the song, he then skipped the next ten songs. Making a face, he took out his ear buds and sat his phone down. He thought for a long while. Why does it all sound...terrible, he thought to himself. He got up and went to his old radio. He flipped through every station and gave most genres a listen, even ones he wasn't partial to like edm and pop. ""Crap...crap...crap..."" He muttered as he flipped through the channels. He turned it off, put his hands on his hips, and sighed. He wasn't sure what was wrong today, he loved listening to his tunes but everything wad just irritating him. He mused over his day, noting it was just an average day at work, even his lunch was nothing special. Dick was used to newer music sounding bad, admitting he wasn't 'hip' to get it most likely, but the classics were, well, classic. Deciding he needed to get out of the house to keep himself busy he went to his local grocery store. He walked in and immediately was struck by the awful music coming from the pa system. He tried going to other stores but it was the same. Can't I go anywhere that's quiet without being cooped up in my house, Dick thought as he saw a park across the street. He crossed and sat on a bench, there were kids playing but no music, ""Thank God."" He said feeling relieved. Suddenly a loud twang from a guitar, striking Dick like a bullet. He looked up and across from him was a man playing with a hat for money at his feet. ""Hey!"" Said Dick. The man stopped playing and looked up at him, ""Hi, got a problem man?"" ""Yes, that's music to my ears."" He said, annoyed. The guitarist smiled, ""Thanks, glad to hear it."" ""That wasn't a compliment!"" He shouted before storming off.   The guitarist looked at the man as he stomped angrily away and shook his head. He went back to playing his guitar. After a few minutes of playing he slowly stopped plucking his strings.

SimplePrompts,3cy3vp,mortalkomic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"Beneath a clear night sky, on the top floor of a tall building standing in the middle of a city, two friends sat by a window, watching the waxing crescent moon move slow across the sky. The window was open and the wind flowed around them, almost silent, as they sipped from a beer and listened to a record. It was playing in another room and the sound came to them muffled, distorted by its passage through the walls and the doors.  ""I love this song."" The first one said. Unconsciously recalling the first time he had heard it. It had been three years before, on a summer day, in the summer heat. He was sitting in the back seat of a small car, being driven to the beach. He didn't know it had existed until then, and in that moment, coincidentally when a light breeze from the AC reached him, he knew it was a good song, but he didn't love it yet.  ""It's a good song."" The other said, but he wasn't paying attention to the music. He was feeling his blood flooding his skin as if it was trying to come out of his pores. He felt its warmth. He felt its flow. He felt the wind caress it from above his skin, and he wished the moonlight wasn't enough to show his face turn red. He took a large gulp from his beer and wished it was enough to cool him down.  ""Something peculiar's happened to music."" The first one said after waiting in silence for a moment. He had been gathering his thoughts, he had been conjuring up the courage to say what his mind wanted to say. There was sweat trickling down his hands, and he dried them off on his pants, pretending it was the condensed water on the cold beer bottle in his hand.   ""Yeah, I know. I think it's 'cause the window's open. It makes it sound a little weird."" The second one said. He didn't know how to reply to the statement, so he gave it his best shot. He didn't want to close the window though. In fact he wished a storm would come and have its winds swallow him. In the winds of a storm his blood would have no choice but to return to his vital organs. It would be enough to make his skin a normal color again.  ""That's not what I meant."" The first one said. Just a thousandth of a second before he spoke, he hadn't been sure he was going to, but his instinct was faster than his reason. Perhaps the words he said aloud had been stolen from reality, perhaps the moon looked down on him and took his words away, perhaps his friend hadn't heard what he said, and they could go on drinking beer. It was wishful thinking, it was the wish of silence. A wish he wanted, and a wish he simultaneously did not want.  ""Oh... uh... what do you mean?"" The second one said. His mind went blank in that instant, and he feared it would stay that way forever, staring endlessly into the eyes of his friend, not knowing how to articulate any thoughts. He might spend his life living in a void, living only in the warmth of his own blood.  ""When I'm with you... it just sounds better. You know?"" There was a moment silence, a moment when even the wind stopped flowing, a moment when the music from the other room became clear, a moment when the light of the moon seemed to chime as it reflected off the surfaces around them.

Tears streamed down the face of the second one, and since his mind remained awestruck, and since his blood seemed now to boil, he hugged his friend. In his shoulder he cried, and with each of his tears a bit of the heat left his innards, and his mind woke back up. ""Thank you."""

Buddy felt it when he walked into the bar, a ratty honky-tonk at the edge of town with too warm beer but an excellent band. Well, normally excellent. Tonight the country band was flat, the meth skinny brunettes silky voice just a shade too emotionless and the too tall guitarist was playing a tad off key. Buddy looked at them a moment, then looked at the crowd. If the other patrons noticed they hid it well, clapping and cheering the group from Nashville as they finished up a Merl Haggard song and launched into a George Jones classic.  Buddy ambled over to the bar, slower than normal. He clapped a couple of friends on the shoulder as he passed, ignoring their offer to take a seat at their table. He wanted to be alone tonight without being alone. He ordered his favorite beer and chatted briefly with the bartender, an older guy who looked like he had fallen out of the ugly tree and hit every branch. The beer was predictably a little warm but also flat. Irked, Buddy whirled around on his bar stool and surveyed the crowded bar.  The little building was packed and if the fire marshal came by there would be hell to pay but strangely the crowd sounded muted, dull. The lights seemed dimmer than they should be and the laughter forced and muted. He grabbed a handful of pretzels from the dish on the bar but even the salted snack seemed dull. Buddy sat there for a long time, nursing his flat beer and eating tasteless pretzels as the crowd around him reveled in a muted celebration that increasingly seemed to be happening further and further away from Buddy.  Buddy stood up abruptly and walked to the bathroom, a tiny cubicle in the back that smelled of smoke and piss. He waited until the only other person left, then went into the single stall and closed the door. He sat down and reached into his coat, withdrawing a blue steeled .38. The checkered grips felt like they were biting into his hand and the gun felt like it weighed a ton. He stared at it, then slowly put the barrel in his mouth and closed his eyes. The front sight cut his palate and the coppery taste of blood mixed with the bitter taste of gun oil. This was the first thing that had felt real all night, the overwhelming feel of the gun and the taste of gun oil and the tears that welled unbidden. one,two,three He cocked the hammer with his thumb and the click seemed to reverberate in the cramped stall. That sounded normal, no shyness to it, no muted sound.   Buddy removed the gun and let the hammer down as he burst out sobbing. He smacked his head with his free hand and snot flowed from his nose as he bawled. He rocked on the porcelain throne and cried until he was empty emotionally. He slipped the gun back under his jacket and exited the stall, stopping in front of the cracked mirror to clean up. He flashed a false smile and headed out, letting his feet carry himself to one of the tables with friends.  One day, Buddy thought, death wont feel as real, will be as diluted as life, and then I'll be able to do it."""

It was the only phrase that Priest Alan kept from their old ways.  “Y-y-yes my child. The rain washes you of all the things you have done. It’s like…” the priest was stuttering, but halted; interrupted.   “Will it wash away what I have done?” She asks, looking down at the priest, her long black hair hanging down in front of her. She stood just outside the doorway of the makeshift shack that the foreign priest built himself. It was nothing like the huts and houses of the tribe, but it did what it should. The priest was now sitting, his back against the wall, his ‘holy text’ in hand. “Now child,” He said, feeling frightened, “Whatever you have done, They will surely forgive you.”   “They? Could you name Them for me?” She said, taking a step inside.   The priest flipped through his book, looking for the names of the gods he had told to the people. He had come looking for the Land of Plenty; where grass still grew, where water wasn’t toxic or irradiated, and where plants held nutriment, instead of death. He had found it, and became trapped, calling himself a messenger from heaven, which needed to tell them of the gods and their ways. He was just about to skip town this rainfall, telling the tribe he was needed back to whence he came, when this woman, Keiva, had caught him the just before leaving. She was always a skeptical one of his teachings, but he felt he had gotten through to her. Now however, he was not so sure.   He found the list and began, naming them each and what they were a part of in nature. Each one rolled off of his tongue as if he had recited the words hundreds of times, but his mind kept racing, thinking of ways out of this situation. Once he finished, he shut the book.   “Hmmm. Those sound much like the ones you told me last year, but not the year before that,” She said, with a strange smile, taking a few steps closer into the shack. “Care to explain? Or is Nethis altering my memories?”   “Y-yes! Good job Keiva! You are ever astute!” He says, looking for the weapon he had hid so long ago in his makeshift desk.   “Nethis, as you said, is the goddess of the underworld. Memani, is the god of wisdom and knowledge, and memories. Priest Alan, I believe it is time I saw you leave. But you will leave my way.” She stands five feet from him, a large knife raised high, and a second in the other hand held low. “Pray to your gods now, I will not allow any more time for your spirit to trespass on our lands.”   The knife came down hard, and Alan lifted his hand from the desk drawer with a 9mm pistol. He fired, and it misfired. The knife cut deep into his arm, and the second one came through his chin and out the top of his skull. He made little noise, and the deed was done quickly.   Keiva left the knives in him, and dragged him outside to the heavy rains, letting it wash over him, and her as well.   “The rain,” She said, “Washes us free from all guilt. Your spirit Priest Alan, is at rest, and mine, is washed anew.”"

I'm a terrible father, they'll hate me forever for this. The little ones, they'll scream and cry.  ""You're the worst, daddy!"" Alex yelled, stomping his tiny feet.  ""I hate you. I hate you forever!"" Sarah cried. I hope that being so young will make them forget, and this won't traumatize them forever. It's for them that I had to do this.   I sighed inwardly, holding them still with one hand on a shoulder each. It was easy, they were so small.   ""DADDY NO!""  I wonder what the neighbors thought. I didn't think they were home, but this had to be done.  ""You can't be seen like this. What will your mother think? All covered in red like you got murdered or something.""

SimplePrompts,3cxp9x,nionvox,2,Sat Jul 11 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"Red Hamblin hadn't meant to kill the kid in town.   Drunk, bleary eyed from lack of sleep and paranoid from that bank job in El Paso Hamblin hadn't hesitated to draw and gun down the town marshal when the old man had approached him and four shots had struck true but the fifth had hit that boy in the crowd, a boy of ten with hair as red as his own and freckles that covered a cherubic face as open as the New Mexico sky. Red had stared at the blood as it spread over the boys chest as his dirty feet, shoeless and calloused, beat a dirge on the rough cut planks of the sidewalk. He was drawn at first to the blood but there was something about the boys face, something familar even as  bloody froth spilled out of his mouth and his eyes stared into the Pearly Gates themselves. Red had gotten out of town fast before a posse could get formed. Killing a kid was bad news and unsettling. He had killed plenty of men, first in the Civil War, then as a bandit in the west. Never a kid though.  He had ridden south at first, across the open plains and toward the state border. He figured he had a good two hour start on the posse. The town had only had the marshal and while the blood lust for him would be high it would take time to organize a party. He rode his horse hard at first, then slowed down. If his horse came up lame out here now he would be as good as dead. At night he bedded down, tying his horse to a mesquit tree that grew on the banks of a dried up arroyo and drifted off to sleep without a fire into a restless sleep. He had dreams of the boy, where Red was jerking at the end of a rope while under him the boys body mimicked his spasms as life drained out of the hole in his chest.  It was the thunder that awoke him, booming and horrible. He bolted out of his bedroll, COlt in hand and sweeping the darkness. He heard something else too, a horse whicker to the west, close by. Cursing softly, Red stood up in a crouch. The posse was close but if luck held they might not know where he was in the dark. Clouds had hidden the moon and the only light came from intermittent flashes of lightning. Holstering his gun, he went to his horse, patted it, whispered soothing words as he untied it. Silently, he led it into the dry arroyo. It would be deep enough to conceal him from the posse, the only cover in the flat landscape. He had just reached the bottom when lightning struck the mesquit and his horse reared in panic. Red tried to calm him, get him under control, but fear had the horse and it lashed out, struggled, and before Red could get out of the way it trampled over him.  How long he laid there he didn't know. When he came to it was still dark and rain was falling heavy. He felt numb and laid there, listening. He couldn't hear anything over the rain and he hoped the posse had taken after his horse in the dark thinking he had been on it. The rain got harder and Red wiped a hand over his face. Got to get out of here, he thought. Bad place to be when its raining. He tried to stand but his legs wouldn't obey. Again he willed himself to rise and again he just laid there. My legs, he thought, I can't feel them. Panic gripped him and his heart was trying to hammer out of his chest. Gonna drown, gonna drown. Got to get up. No, can't,can't.   Tears mixed with the rain . The storm got harder and he knew it would only be time before a rush of brown water came down the arroyo. Drowning worse than hanging, he thought. Not going to die that way. He reached for his gun but found his holster empty. He sobbed as he never had before as his head looked, left, right, left again, then in a flash of lightning he saw it laying ten feet away, it's muzzle pointing at him. He cried, sorrowful sobs that wracked his body. Then he heard it. A sound, a voice on the bank!   ""Help me!""  He waited  ""Hey, help me!""  Red waited, listening over the drum of the rain on dirt. Then he heard someone scrambling down the dirt bank of the arroyo to his left. He cried again, this time tears of joy.  ""You got to get me out of here. I can't feel..."" The words froze in his throat as lightning flashed in the sky and he saw his rescuer. It was the boy from town, pale skin dry even in a rain now turning torrential, bloody coveralls soaked with blood but not moisture and bare feet that walked in the now muddy ground but left no tracks. The boy stood over Red, looking him in the face with eyes as emotionless as a rattlesnakes. Then the boy sat crosslegged by Reds head. His blood flecked lips opened and in a voice as soft as an angels sigh the boy told Red, ""The rain washes us free from all our guilt."""

His face was twisted in frantic concentration, tongue peeking out of the left side of his mouth, and his eyes were fixed dead ahead of him where nobody waited nor watched.  Slowly, he lifted his right leg and swung it in an ungainly arc to his left side. His arms wheeled round and round in recovering a balance he hadn't yet had occasion to lose. The foot landed, and he straightened his back. Suddenly smiling, he pulled his arms in and then slowly pushed them outwards in front of him, fingers straight to form a cutting edge with the side of his palm. The right leg swung out to the original position again, eyes once more fixed in concentration, body tense. Rinse and repeat.  ""What's the deal with him?""

As he had several times already, he began to walk around the circular hallway that formed the basis of the cell block, making a show of looking in every single nook and cranny.  Shortly thereafter, another guard did the same.  Exactly the same, down to the inflection of each syllable and the scrupulous but useless efforts at detection.  The investigator ignored them.  He knew they weren't very smart and were therefore predictable.  They wouldn't find anything.  The prisoner had already left.  The investigator actually did know where the missing man was, but knew also that he had to finish his job.  He walked into the cell and looked around.  There were a few objects of interest, each possessed of an odd gleam.  He systematically examined each one, for some reason announcing his thoughts aloud as if he had an audience.  Then he noticed the message.  It had been carved raggedly into the back of the cell, and was nearly illegible.  There was no gleam, so he knew it wasn't really important to his progress, but he was curious nonetheless.  He approached it, knelt down in front of it, and reached out with his hand to trace the lettering.  A few seconds later, his vision turned red and he fell to the floor.  Confused and angry, he looked up to see the erstwhile escapee, eyes glowing crimson, with a bloody shank in his hand.  The prisoner?  Here?  How?  This wasn't supposed to happen at all.  Maybe some kind of Easter egg?  His vision dimmed.  He cursed, knowing that he would have to go through this entire mess all over again.  Before everything faded to black, he finally deciphered the chickenscratch engaved in the pitted stone wall.  No, actually it's a feature.  The investigator barked a short laugh and then died.  There was complete blackness for a few moments.  ""The prisoner has escaped,"" the guard announced loudly, for the fifth time..."

I get no reply and the hour becomes two hours. I try to remain stiff, and cold. I tell myself that traffic can be insane, that maybe his car is having trouble... but in my heart I am screaming.   When I hit the three hour mark, I finally give up my vigil. Slowly, with a backward glance to the window, I walk to my room and undress. Off comes the pretty dress, the fancy earrings...

Late night piano music drift across the hall to strike a soft yet somehow sterile ambiance befitting a hospital lobby. A statue of Jesus healing the sick woman imposes its presence upon me from the center of the chamber. It's the last thing I see before the elevator doors close and I am caught in suffocating silence as my cage rises one, two, three floors, and I step out. It's 10:46 pm. I walk past the quiet emotional cacophony of huddled families and through the double doors of the intensive care unit.  11:00 pm. I walk as part of a well-oiled machine of clinical precision. I check patients with my comrades in blue, green, and red uniforms. Comfort weary, distressed families. I am warm, but not too warm. Give of yourself. Do what you can, but don't get caught up in their emotion. We are a well-oiled machine, we have to be. Activity becomes a blur.  Is it really only 11:45 pm? I rub my eyes.

I look away as the doctor meets them, and drift on through the hall. 12:17 pm.   I am haunted by the image of the patient's granddaughter, sobbing uncontrollably into a orange knit sweater. For some reason, it hit me harder than any of the others. It maybe her first encounter with death. Not her last.  The hospital is a storm I must weather. Every night I am drenched with the sorrow of others but I cannot allow myself to sink under the waves. Every morning I leave this place and dry myself in the sunshine.  I go on checking patients.

SimplePrompts,3cqzqz,wildmanfluffy,3,Fri Jul 10 07:29:14 2015 UTC,"On a bright spring day, at the back of the flower garden on his parents’ estate, young Cooper Vanderbilt was caring for a baby bird. The poor creature had fallen out of its nest and broken a wing, and its mother was nowhere to be found. It was making a forlorn “pi-pi-pi” sound, and Cooper couldn’t resist stroking its downy head with his fingertip.  He picked an earthworm out of the wriggling pile he’d collected and dangled it over the tiny beak, but the bird wasn’t catching on. Maybe he had to chew it up first and drop it directly into the bird’s mouth—that was what mama birds did, right? The animal had such a firm grip on his heartstrings that he was seriously considering it.  Cooper was so engrossed in tending to the bird that he didn’t hear his mother walk up behind him. “Coop,” she gasped, “what the hell are you doing?”  “Nothing,” Cooper replied hurriedly, trying and failing to block her view of the bird.  “Did you do this?” She was pointing at the makeshift splint he had assembled out of twigs and stems, and her face was darker than a thundercloud.  “Yeah,” he mumbled.  Ava Vanderbilt took a step forward and, with the pointed toe of her Jimmy Choo, delivered a precise blow that snapped the bracing twigs and inflicted another fracture on the baby bird’s broken wing.  “NO!” Cooper screamed.  His mother glared at him. “I can’t believe my eyes and ears. Cooper William Vanderbilt Junior, something is wrong with you!”  Cooper curled up in a heap on the ground, overwhelmed with shame and grief.  “Wilfred!” called Mrs. Vanderbilt, stepping around her sobbing son.   The bushes rustled, and a smartly dressed fellow popped up beside her with a “yes ma’am!”  “Call Dr. Morrison and make an appointment immediately. Tell her who’s calling, and make it clear that it’s an emergency! And have Jones bring the car. Coop, you stop with that horrible noise right now and show some self-respect. We’re leaving.”  They rode in stony silence to the private practice of Dr. Elizabeth Morrison, child psychologist, and hurried inside while the street was empty. Just in case, Mrs. Vanderbilt made sure to conceal her distinctive stare with a pair of diamond-spangled Gucci sunglasses.  Dr. Morrison greeted the family and introduced herself to the boy, who extended a small hand earnestly. “Cooper Vanderbilt Junior. Pleased to meet you.”  “The pleasure is all mine,” the doctor replied. “Would you mind joining me in my office?”  Mrs. Vanderbilt pulled her aside. “I caught him coddling a bird in the garden,” she whispered darkly. “Does that mean—?”   “It could certainly be a symptom, but I can’t be sure until I talk to Cooper. Alone.”  Upon entering Dr. Morrison’s office, the boy quickly discovered her vast library of games and toys. She waited until Cooper had started to assemble a tower out of wooden blocks, then interrupted him: “Hey, I want to play with the blocks, too. Will you share them with me?”  “Sure,” the boy responded, indicating the pile of leftover blocks.  “Can I have that one?” Dr. Morrison asked, pointing at a piece he had already incorporated into his structure.   “I’m using it,” Cooper protested.  “I really, really want it though. It’s my favorite one. Would you be so kind as to give it to me? Pretty please?”  Cooper nodded reluctantly. Disappointment clouded his face as he extracted the block from between its neighbors, but when he offered it up and heard the friendly doctor exclaim “Thank you, thank you!” he broke into a genuine smile.  “I need to talk to your mama for a minute,” Dr. Morrison said. “I’ll be right back.”  Dr. Morrison made sure the door to her office had closed behind her before she sat down to give Mrs. Vanderbilt the bad news. “Your son has what we call PSPD, or pro-social personality disorder. In common terms, he’s an empath.”  Mrs. Vanderbilt inhaled sharply. “Are you absolutely certain?”  “He has very strong signs. It’s always a judgment call, but—”  “This is a disaster for me,” Mrs. Vanderbilt hissed. “I’m scheduled to interview with Mothers Magazine. I can’t have a defective child! And if those soulless muckrakers get ahold of this, it’ll ruin my husband’s campaign. How fast can you treat him?”  Dr. Morrison clasped her hands and sighed. “PSPD doesn’t respond to any known treatment,” she admitted. “But don’t lose hope. Most children who display empathetic behavior at young ages grow out of it.”  “And the ones who don’t?” demanded Mrs. Vanderbilt.  “They can still live full and productive lives,” the doctor assured her. ""There are careers empaths excel at. For example, they have a particular talent for psychology.”  Mrs. Vanderbilt’s eyes widened, and she hauled Cooper by the wrist out of the office."

One in each of the walls he stood facing now with his back turned towards the elevator. He had been in all of these. Right in the center of the hall the floor was emblazoned with the blue yellow company logo. Everything looked almost exactly as on the floor below. The only difference was the color palette. Here everything beside the logo was held in yellowish tones. Apparently some sort of orientation help. But it didn’t help him now. Was there something he had forgotten to do? Mentally he went through all the rooms on this floor and then it hit him. The old guy on the floor below had told him to return to him once the cryogenic tubes were repaired. He had forgotten that.

And I have overwritten the last save. Dude if we can’t go down anymore I have to start the whole fucking game from the beginning. I hate it when video games do that.”"
SimplePrompts,3cqjqd,ErnstBird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"The two of us sit there, motionless. Erica’s fingers are still wrapped around the neck of her glass; only her face has had time to react, and I can see in her look of panic that what she’s bracing for, in the next few seconds, is not my shame but hers. The prospect of an understanding smile, a shrug, a few words of dismissal. Of doing something disingenuous and knowing that I will know. Somewhere above us the waiter is still hovering, not quite sure when to repeat himself, or how loudly, or whether he should simply wait there in nervous silence while I fumble for an explanation.   “Um,” I begin, which is already a misfire, already a forfeiture of any chance at recovery. I only have one card. No cash. I have no way out of this. I’m trapped in a room without windows or doors. The tablecloth under my palms feels hot; the lights begin to spin. Erica is looking at me, her features slowly rearranging themselves as she inches toward a response. I run through half a dozen scenarios in the span of a moment: I offer to go out to an ATM; I insist that their card reader is broken; I ask Erica to pay now, and offer to settle up later. But not only do none of these seem palatable, they seem altogether out of reach. I could as easily produce a hundred dollar bill from between my teeth as any of those.   “Do you have—” the waiter begins, trying to sound helpful, but stops as soon as he sees the arch in my brow, as though he has reached in through my scalp and wrapped his fingers around the stem of my brain. It occurs to me that, in this place, a single credit card is probably anomalous. Erica herself has at least three; I’ve seen them when she flips open that candy apple-red leather wallet at Pomme Frites or Blue Ginger, at Duane Reade to buy condoms. I am reeling through a kaleidoscope of bad endings to this night. I am very, very close to the grown man’s nightmare: crying in a public place.   Then Erica puts her hand on mine and says, “I’ll get it.”   I reach up and take my own card from the waiter, who says nothing to either one of us as she hands hers over. I never thought that seeing her smile would make me so unhappy.   A few minutes later, in the cab, I tell her, “I will absolutely pay you back for that.”  “It’s okay,” she says, but she says it too quickly, and she says it out the window toward the shuttered stores and darkened stoops. Not to me. “I don’t mind. I had a good time.”  I want to press her, though, I want to just be so clear that this is a one-time thing, that I am not the man this will make me out to be, that there is more to me than my poverty. But I don’t know how to convince her of that when I am not convinced. In twenty minutes we will be back at her place, and she will invite me in, and we will have good but not great sex. And I will lie awake next to her, all through the night, afraid to touch her or to look at her, trying to enjoy the softness of her bed and the smell of her perfume and sweat like a last meal. And I don’t know what will happen after that. I never do. Sometimes the money is there, and sometimes it isn’t. But being poor I can handle. It’s the not knowing that kills me."
SimplePrompts,3cp9dk,sarahkat13,6,Thu Jul 9 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"The dancer limped out onto the stage.   ""Please,"" he said, holding up his hands, ""please don't make me do this anymore."" He wavered slightly; his head seemed to phase in and out of consciousness. There was a crawling sensation in his gut, something that was rolling around numbly and causing his esophagus to bob in an effort to keep everything inside.   The men sitting comfortably in the second row of seats waved their hands derisively at him. Their leader, dressed unlike the others in a crisp grey uniform, clapped his hands in three measured beats.   ""Get on with it,"" he shouted. His smile did nothing to soften his face; if anything, it made the angles of his mouth and the blade of his nose sharper. ""Get on with it or we'll put a hole in your other leg!""  The dancer glanced down at his left leg, where a ribbon of blood trickled out of the hole in his calf.  A movement caught his eye, and he looked up to see one of the others, a hired local in a paint-splattered t-shirt and a meshback hat, waving the .22 the dancer had originally been shot with.  The meshback had a slick, oily grin on his face, a scabrous bit of glee dancing amongst four days growth of unwashed beard.  The dancer began moving on instinct, threading himself into the routine nearest to the surface of his mind.  The movements of Lily Caught In The Rain Gutter were subtle, more subtle than he could manage with a low caliber bullet in his leg, but he forced himself through the motions regardless.  He ground his teeth as he danced, crushing his jaw together until he could hear minute cracks in the silence of his head.    ""None of this fag shit!"" the man with the .22 yelled.  The man in the grey uniform looked at this man without expression, and the man with the .22 eventually shrank back and looked at his feet.  The uniformed man then gestured for the dancer to continue, extending his hand with the palm up, mild and mannered.  The dancer kept moving through the formations of Lily Caught In The Rain Gutter and then without thinking about curled into the compressed starting position of The Fallen One Reaches For The Cure.  Too late he realized that the seventh set of movements in the piece required him to stretch outwards while balanced on his left leg; he tried to keep himself upright but quickly found himself with his nose pressed into the worn wooden floor of the stage.  There were jeers from the local men, and clapping from the uniformed leader.  ""Pity,"" the leader called out.  ""I was enjoying it.  It's so hard to find anyone with any sort of artistic sensibilities that are as subtle as your movements.  The only performances I get to see these days are as subtle as a live sex show.""  He stretched back in his seat, threaded his hands behind his head, and grinned.  ""I guess it's up to the boys as to what they want to see now.""  ""Do the mashed potato!"" the man holding the .22 yelled.  ""Do the fuckin' hitch-hiker!"" another one said, his semi-toothed visage screwing together in a mockery of honest laughter.  A third man stood, and picked up the rifle that had been propped up next to him.  It was meaner than the other's .22; it was long, black, and topped with a long scope.    ""Do the fuckin' running man,"" this one growled, and pointed the scoped rifle at the dancer.  ""Do it perfectly.  If you fall down I swear by God almighty that I'll pop your head like a fuckin' zit.""  The dancer blinked, and then regarded the leader.  ""Please,"" he said, ""please don't make me do this anymore.""  The leader brought his hands around to his knees, leaned forward, and gave the dancer a look of amusement and pity.  ""Well, now, my hands are sort of tied here.  You did such a good job for me, but the people here have spoken,"" he gestured towards his men, ""and I tend never to mess with the will of the people.  However,"" he said, tapping at his chin, ""maybe they could be persuaded to find other entertainment if you tell me where your friends were keeping their dynamite, and the rest of their guns.""  The dancer looked away from the uniformed leader and pressed his face back into the stage.  ""You know,"" the leader continued, his voice gentle.  ""Your friends?  The ones hung up from the lamp posts out on 8th Street out there?""  The dancer continued to keep his face pressed into the stage.  ""Ah well,"" the leader sighed.  His hands returned to support the back of his head.  ""You heard the boys.  Get dancin'.  I suggest you start with Carl here and the runnin' man.  He gets awfully disappointed when things don't go his way.""  With a supreme effort the dancer hauled himself to his knees.  He stared blearily out into the audience, his vision fogging his audience.  He turned his head to the side and dry-heaved.  ""Get to it!"" Carl yelled, and for a brief instant the dancer's vision focused on the impossibly black hole of the man's scoped rifle.  He pushed himself up into a standing position and put his arms out to steady his balance.  ""Dance, asshole!"" Carl shouted.  He fired the rifle; the clap of gunfire was deafening and splinters of wood shot up out of the stage a foot from where he stood.  The dancer launched into the running man, driving his exhausted limbs on pure fear.  His arms and legs pumped with abandon, fueled by the cold streams of adrenaline flowing into them.  I'm doing it! he thought wildly, I'm actually going to make it! He then came down badly on his left leg and crumpled into a heap on the stage.  A second later another gunshot rang out, and the dancer's head looked as though it had been a ripe tomato that someone had pitched into the stage from a great height.  ""Well, that's that, I guess,"" the leader said.  ""Get your stuff packed up and we'll make the rounds before we head out.""  ""Fuck, I wanted to see the mashed potato,"" the man with the .22 grumbled.  ""Wish we could have found these asshole's dynamite,"" the second man said.  The leader laughed.  ""Oh, it's in the back of the Gem Theater, couple blocks down,"" he said, as though it had been obvious all along.  ""Patrol found it last night, they didn't hide it very well.""  He gestured towards the prone form of the dancer, whose blood was pouring out of the stump of his head to pool in the worn depressions of the stage.  ""I just wanted some entertainment, is all.""  Carl loaded two more shells into his rifle and the leader slapped him on the back.  ""Let's get a move on,"" he said.  ""We've got a long trail to Chicago."""

Everyone counted how many seconds the cameras clicked for and the number of voices that called out in admiration, made extensive mental notes. Also, timing was of the essence when arriving at the red carpet.  The artist had outdone herself this time, surely. It was a theatre, red curtains, red carpets, and dark heavy-wood construction with golden frills on everything.  They assembled in the hall, seats removed, everyone on their feet.  The dancer limped out onto the stage. Slowly, in pain, clutching fists to stop from crying out. Right to the middle of the spotlight. And then he stood still.  They filed out in studious silence, in their own time, the limousines whisking them away into the night."
SimplePrompts,3cp9dk,Canus_Flatum,3,Fri Jul 10 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"First post in this sub... I have not written in years, but found writing prompts, and then this sub. Feedback is appreciated. And here it is.   The second act was quickly coming to a close. I felt Margarita squeeze my hand as the orchestra crescendo thundered to its climax. I had never seen such dancing, as the ballet dancers leapt, moved, tumbled, and flew across the stage.    It was our first time at a ballet and we were lucky enough to be at one with a live orchestral performance. The tickets were expensive, but Margarita was worth it. We were having the time of our lives. The ballerina was phenomenal; I have never seen such grace. And yet, even she was eclipsed by the male lead. In the intermission he was the buzz. His movements, his grace, his power, were all very nearly otherworldly with the music echoing his talent. He was a god in this theater.    As the crescendo hit its climactic notes and the movement was winding down, he went up only to come down. There was a twist and a fall. The music ground to a halt as only string instruments seem to be able to with a screech of death. The lilting tones turning up sharp with a scrrreeeeech.  The crowd took a collective gasp in the silence as the stage went dark and we heard the patter of feet coming to help the man.     As Margarita squeezed my hand, there were slow conversation sounds growing like a fungus on the mood. In one second, this dancer had fallen from god to mortal, and bound by mortal weaknesses, had shat all over my night.     “Vamos, Margarita.” I whispered. “The show is over.” “No, Miguel, I want to stay”. She retorted, taking her hand from mine. Dang, a second loss to the night.     “Come on, the show is over, we can get ice cream by the stadium, it’s not far. Vámanos!” I insisted.     “Que No!” As soon as she said it, I tuned out. I was going to get an earful. Margarita is as sweet as they come, but her moods are a force of nature. What’s worse is that I have a streak of stubborn that drives me to push her to the limit.     “Nunca me escuchas…” she continued on as I sat back in my seat. Defeated but determined not to show it. It was perfect timing to do this because the entire theater suddenly went dark.     “What’s going on?” Margarita asked.  “No sé” I replied. “They must be getting ready to shut down.”    What is going on? Is it over? Why hasn’t anyone moved?  My thoughts were crowding me in my own head. Thump shhhhht. Thump shhhhht. A slow moving sound made it’s way up through the audience.     Suddenly a spotlight ripped through the blackness. The male dancer was there, limping onto the stage. One foot sure, the other slowly dragging behind him. From our seats we could not see it, but people were saying he was crying. The entire audience was fixated. You could feel their interest, the various emotions clogging the air, focused on this man.     He stopped center stage and bowed in apology. The spotlight illuminating his white tights. The silence was deafening. It was so thick that when he moved, no one understood what was happening. There was music. I wasn’t sure when it started, but it wasn’t important. He was moving. And I was standing with the crowd applauding.       It was opening night and I was lead dancing my own choreography. Well, at least one scene was mine, but it was the most moving. I hardly remembered the first movement, the second was winding down and it was almost time. pirouette, jeté, battement, the series was winding towards me. Finally, it was time. Battement, pause, grand jeté- crumple, my left leg in a heap.     The orchestra hit the scratch perfect, it echoed through the theater like a death knell. The aids ran out as the stage went dark, the audience’s gasp was heavenly, as sweet as hearing the first gasp of uncontrolled pleasure coaxed from a lover. I had them.  The aids carried me off in a heap as the audience started murmuring. No one was quite sure what was going on.  The confusion thickened the air; it was palpable. Now, the most difficult moments of my life. Five to be exact. Five minutes of absolute silence, with the audience left to their own devices in the dim light. It was an eternity.     A quick squeeze to my shoulder and my director whispered, “Go, show them majesty tonight”. Then he was gone, off to coordinate something or other. It didn’t matter, this was my show now.     I began limping onstage, right foot sure, left foot dragging hard against my sacred ground. My footsteps echoed through the hall. Four steps to the light – bang - Older spotlights announce themselves when they come alive, and this one announced itself to a silence that was so focused it almost stopped me from walking.     I made it to center stage; tears of joy had welled up and streamed down my face. I bowed as if in apology and waited for my cue. A small tap under the stage announced that everything was ready.  A dancer limped out onto the stage; a god was going to walk off. I began to move and the applauding thunder rained down in benediction."

She could just melt away, like snow on warm water, not sending a single ripple, or changing a quark of human existence.  Perhaps that was why, on that lukewarm autumn day when the leaves were falling, she appeared a lonely figure upon the bridge, staring into the depths of the water below. Perhaps her fatigue which sucked the marrow from her limbs, and the melancholy that wrapped itself over her mouth and nose was the acknowledgement that she was, and always had been invisible. She had lain low amongst the crowds, her head tucked between her legs, snatching the fragments of air which drifted past her. Alone, she had crawled, with no sense of direction and no purpose.  And gradually, she noticed that her knee caps had been worn raw, her path even more obscure and the fragments of air becoming more sour after each breath. The despondency which had always lurked in the depth of her spirit bloomed, and one day, she woke up and realised that to drag her injured limbs through life would just cause her more suffering, and that her dissapearance would forever go unnoticed by the crowds which trampled across her poor head.   A sense of tiredness and cathartic relief shook through her body. The torrents of water looked most welcoming, and she imagined her lifeless body contrasted amongst the water, floating, drifting, away from this wretched hell."

I clicked the line over again, but didn't immediately take the next call. 4 seconds to unclench teeth, sigh, let my shoulders cringe than stoop another imperceptible milimeter lower as the barrage of incoming call alerts echoed around the room.  ""BECKY! PHONES!""  The roar ripped forth from Rothchild's office, reverberated round the foyer, a rushing thunderclap to the rain of the telephone calls.   ""Yes sir, sorry sir!""  I return to the phone.  ""World Ark Headquarters, can you hold please?""  ""Hello, yes, there's a leak in subsection 2 and we are running out of air, we've only got a few minutes left.""  There were murmurs in the background, movement, a speaker phone call and a room full of people.  ""Yes, we're aware of the leak, can you hold please?""  ""Daddy? Are they fixing it?""  ""Sh, quiet Jacob, daddy's speaking.""  ""Sir, can you ho...  ""Dadeeeee!""  More voices took up the cry, and as the man on the other end of the phone took to shushing them something in me switched.  ""Sir... SIR""  ""Sh, yes, quiet...Sorry, ma'am, yes, I'm here""  Deep breath.  ""World Ark knows about the leak, it's actually the third this month. They're keeping it quiet. They don't want panic. Don't want to overload the other pods.""  The cacophony on the other end faded, adult voices first, stunned by the words. The children kept babbling until even the youngest could feel the dread silencing the others.   His voice wobbled upward from within, heavy as though stones were trying to hold them down. ""Um, excuse me, please. Could you say that again?""  ""Sir, sometime in the next few minutes someone will call you back and say they are very sorry but a repair crew is on the way and that I've been fired for being a prankster. That is a lie. I'm going to hang up in a moment, but what you need to do right now is calmly take everyone in your pod and go to the local fire control subsection, tell them you require immediate evacuation under Title 11X378 of the Word Ark and Cryogenic General Contract of Rights and Waivers, and don't let him deter you. Tell as many people as you can, but don't start a panic.""  ""BECKY!""  I hung up the phone as Rothchild raged, noticing how many call alerts were going untaken as I lingered on this.

It looks so calm from up here, the noise of people rushing to and fro can’t be heard from this height, and the lights which seemed so blindingly bright when I was down there are dim sparkles now. It’s not like what people said, it’s not like looking at stars, it’s too orderly for that.  I come up here often to clear my head, not many people come to the old tourist attraction anymore, it’s little wonder considering the fact that it’s falling apart these days. I idly wonder what they’ll be doing tomorrow as I look down upon the city from the tower, ignoring the growing pain in my arm. Most people will go on with their daily lives I suspect, and why wouldn’t they? Nothing will have changed, nothing important anyway, not for most of them.  The florist will be eagerly awaiting the morning delivery, not because he’s ready to start work, but because of that delivery girl who always makes sure she’s on the route going past his shop. The boy working at the pizza place will be apologising profusely for spilling a drink or dropping a plate and the manager will be threatening to take it out of his paycheck, but he never does because he sees something of himself in the boy. The old man will be sitting at the park having a conversation with his wife, long since passed, with the hope she’s out there somewhere listening to him and laughing at his jokes.  Yeah, they’ll all be fine.  “Hold on. Please.”  I look up.  Smile.  And let go of his hand."

Those simple times when we would go for coffee, and drive to the outskirts of town to see the sun set at 7 p.m.   It was the white of the lilies that would blossom just before her birthday. I would grab some for her. Two days after everybody else had celebrated with her. They were always her favorite present though. A small thing in return for all that she would make for me on the winter solstice.  White ivory contrasting the dark ebony of the piano she would glide over and mesmerize any and all with. Mostly me.   The white of the cute summery dress that I helped her pick out. She didn't think it looked good on her at first. She was so terribly wrong from where I was standing.   *  ""I...

My white has diluted your black veneer. You can put a new coat on. You can change, and nobody will know that you were ever there.  Except for you and I.  My white fabric is stained.

The void that would be left inside her was one that would be never be able to fill again. One that no matter how much pleasure and desire one would obtain. It could never fill the hole that has been opened because of that fateful winter evening.

Her father was 10 feet to the right with what looks like a hatchet struck right between the eyes. Blanca couldn't believe what she was seeing. Just earlier that day her life was as perfect as a 12 year olds life could be. She lived a comfortable life in the New York Suburbs. Her father was a business man who worked at that new trade center and her mother was a High School English teacher. Her cat mittens and the countless books she reads were her world. She couldn't ask for a more comfortable life.    There in the snow around her parents bodies was huge splotch of red. Blood obviously she realized. As she walked towards her father, barely able to stand up she caught a shape moving near the side of her home. In between the house and the pile of firewood.   The shape moved close. Realizing it was a man with a black leather jacket, dark blue jeans and what look like biker boots with sliver metallic skulls on the tip. Shotgun in hand he started to move closer. ""Well well there love"" he said in a heavy foreign accent. ""I see you have uncovered your parents. Bodies, tragic aint it?"" he said in an almost mocking tone.  Blanca couldn't move, her legs were numb, from the cold, shock or pure terror as seeing this man walk towards her she didn't know. ""Boss Marco didn't say anything about a twerp in the family, well... no matter, I don't need no witnesses anyways I'm already on probation as it is"". He lifted the shotgun to her head.

Crows feet and laugh lines more prominent than ever. Her  reflection stared back at her, almost menacingly. ""Ha!"" she said to herself, ""You thought you were invincible.

Her bed seemed less empty that night for some reason.  The world around her blurred as her eyes grew heavy, his face appeared before her. She smiled.  ""I love you,"" and then she fell asleep.   The End."
SimplePrompts,3cncie,EternalDreams,3,Thu Jul 9 06:22:03 2015 UTC,"The man awoke in the pre-dawn darkness from a dreamless sleep, sweat covering his bare torso. August nights in Tennessee were miserable, hot, humid, stifling but the man shunned air conditioning. He enjoyed the heat, reveled in the humidity. It was purifying for him, sweating out his sins and making him pure, making him something else.  The man rose, his knees groaning in protest. Not as young as I used to be, he thought bitterly. But that wouldn't matter after today. He showered briskly, the hot water almost scalding, turning his weathered skin as pink as a new born. He toweled off harshly and dressed in his still darkened bed room as dawn broke across the east. Must hurry an inner voice urged, hurry, hurry, time is short.   He left by the back door and picked up a black duffle bag laying on the back porch. It hadn't been there the night before but he knew it would be there. He reverently laid the canvas bag in the back seat of his battered Malibu before climbing in the drivers seat. Time was short but he took time to buckle up. It wouldn't do to be pulled over, not today. No, not today. Sunday morning traffic was light, too early for the church traffic that would start in a few hours. He drove the speed limit while watching the ball of fire rise in the sky. Mesmerized, he almost plowed into the back of a semi-truck, avoiding disaster in a screech of tortured brakes. Chastened he forced himself to pay attention. Stupid, he told himself, stupid, but the suns rays through the windshield caressed him and he relaxed.   He arrived at his destination later than he had hoped but he knew he would be forgiven. He had been a faithful disciple and after today none would doubt his devotion. He gingerly removed the duffle bag from back seat and gently slung it over his shoulder. He felt the contents shift and heard a faint clink and stiffened in alarm but all was well. I have no fear he thought, I am blessed. He took of at a spry pace, the heavy duffle bag surprisingly light.   Soon he was in front of his shrine where he had prayed every day at sunrise for the last ten years. Today he knew those prayers would be answered. The Sun Sphere rose before him and sunlight reflected off the sphere of gold colored glass that towered before him. Built over thirty years ago the non-believers thought it a mere left over from the 1982 Worlds Fair. He knew the truth however, after the old gods of fire had talked to him after he had burned his family that October night ten years ago. Their cries had been a chorus that had awakened the Old Ones who lived in the Sun. Every day since then he had prayed to them and when demanded offered appropriate sacrifices. An abandoned building here, a house here and there where the Old Ones would chose who to honor with the Flames and who would live to spread the gospel. Once a neighbors cat sacrificed in a furnace but the Old Gods did not like that for some reason.   Silently he prayed to them as the non-believers in town woke. He giggled when the Old Ones told them what to do and he raised his eyes beatifically to the golden sphere as tears off joy came unbidden. Rising, he laid the duffle bag on the ground and unzipped it. Sunlight glinted off the bottles as he caressed one of the Molotov Cocktails. Solemnly he zipped the bag back up. Not here, the voices had said. They had told him where to find the most sacrifices and with a smile on his face the man started walking east into the sun. After today the world would learn the Old Ones were back and he was their prophet."

SimplePrompts,3cmeq2,BestCaseSurvival,6,Thu Jul 9 01:13:12 2015 UTC,"""So I just sit here?""  Ron looked up at the grizzled commander, one hand pushing up his thick framed standard issue glasses.  ""That's right.""  The old man laughed, ""Don't worry Stinson, this is the easiest duty in the whole fleet.  There's coffee and snacks, and you can surf the net all night long.  Just don't fall asleep,"" suddenly his voice cooled and he narrowed his eyes, ""They'll kill you for that.""  Just as quickly he was laughing again, ""Yes sir.  Shoot you right out of the tube.  But don't worry, you're a good kid.  I'm sure you can stay awake right?""  ""Yes sir,"" Ron nodded eagerly, his glasses falling further with each bounce. ""But sir, what if it rings?""  He turned to indicate the red box on the desk, encased in a plastic shield.  ""Well, I suppose son, I suppose you'll just have to answer it.  But don't worry.  This line has been here since planetfall, and it has never been used.  We gave up warfighting a loong time ago, you know that.  Now just read your book, and remember, stay awake!""  And with that the Commander wheeled about, the door opening with the flash of a keycard.  When it closed behind him the green light above the door flashed yellow three times and then changed to red.    Ron was locked in.   On the desk beside him the red phone sat, the  plastic cased yellowed with time.  Next to it a modern phone was set up, the video screen covered with black tape.  In one corner a simple service bot hummed along patiently, waiting for orders.  Ron turned to the other desk beside him, and with a simple motion the keyboard and interface was projected in front of him.  The pads of his fingers tapped softly on the smooth tabletop, and soon he was lost watching videos of the latest Treble match.  ""Coffeee SirR?""  The voicebox creaked as the bot shuffled forward, a pot of coffee held in the crude articulated hand.  Ron jumped, startled, and turned to the bot.  ""No, thanks.  I don't drink the stuff.  I don't suppose you're important enough for a ticket.  What's wrong with your modulator?""  The bot paused, halfway to the desk.  The humming became higher pitched, almost a buzzing sound.  ""Diaaagagagnostics runnniinG""   The distinct crunching of data being processed filled the room, almost as mesmerizing as the steam rising from the pot.  ""All systeMS optimalmalmal.  Modulation parameters acCceptableE.""  The bot began shuffling forward again, ""CofffeeE sir?""  Ron centered his glasses again, ""I said no.  Coffee bot or no, I'm putting in a ticket.  There is something obviously wrong with you- HEY! What are you going?""  Ron jumped out of his chair as the robot's arm turned ninety degrees, coffee spilling and cracking the weathered yellow plastic, seeping into the cracks of the red handset.  The electric smell of ozone filled the air.  Ron tried to leap out of the way as the bot's arm came crashing down again, the glass pot shattering on his shoulder.  The shards of glass bit deep into his flesh and he felt the bots strength grinding them into his bone.  With a wordless wail, Ron fell to his knees.  His hand went for his side arm, but it was all he could to to grab the blasters handle.  His shoulder was mangled, and each movement brought new flashes of pain.  ""Shutdown!  Emergency shutdown!""  Ron tried to yell the access codes that would terminate the bot's subroutines as its free hand clamped around his throat.  Then Ron felt himself grow lighter as he was flung across the room.  He crashed into the food cart, his jaw and shoulder aching.  Across the room the bot stood still facing the desk, the servos winding down to a normal pitch again.  The dull red light above the door was a brutal reminder that he was alone until the next shift change.  Ron's vision was growing cloudy, but if he squinted he could still see the bot standing in front of the desk, humming along as if nothing had happened.  Ron coughed and heard a wheezing sound from his chest.  They covered that in basic.  Punctured or collapsed lung.  Inject foaming agent from right trouser pocket.    Ron tried to laugh but it hurt to even to think.  He hadn't thought to ask how to get to his right pocket when his shoulder was broken.  They didn't cover that in basic.  And then he heard it.  It had never been used, the old commander had said.  Humans hadn't fought since the Contact War.  Traders, producers.  ""We gave up warfighting a long time ago,"" he had said.  Still it was there, the muted buzzing of a blown speaker.  It wasn't ringing, but it was definitely a phone.  Even as it grew too hard to focus and his eyelids became too heavy to hold, he listened for the gentle buzz buzz.....buzz buzz.....buzz buzz.... as it lulled him to sleep."

SimplePrompts,3cmeq2,TheFacelessPoncho,2,Thu Jul 9 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"We crossed eyes across a river. It was three years ago - across the famous bridges of Chicago. You smiled and waved, and I did the same. It was more than the smile - you had a pretty dress on, but it was short, so I thought you'd be cold.  The next day I went to past the bridges again, and I looked out for you, but you weren't there.  The next time was in New York, a week later, in a small Manhattan pub. I'd done something stupid like spill my drink or drop my phone but we talked for half an hour until I realised you were the same person. We both lived in France, but were on holiday back home for one reason or another. I gave you my number, told you to ring when I was back.  I sabotaged us. I maybe even knew at the time I was going to. We've built something over three years that I've never experienced in my life - with nobody before, not even my ex-Wife as you've began to claim. But it  had a high price on you - I realise that now. Please remember that I still walk home every evening to my baby boy and wife in the 19th arrondissement a joyful man.   The number was more of a formality, in my mind, to tell you I enjoyed your company. I didn't expect you to ring back. A week later I was eating breakfast in my flat. The table vibrated. The phone had never made that sound before."
SimplePrompts,3cmeq2,Calstifer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:17:41 2015 UTC,"trill-o, trill-o  Jake snapped awake.  ""The fuck was that?""  trill-o, trill-o  The young man searched for his phone, finding it with the face aglow.    trill-o, trill-o  ""Wha?""  Jake groggily flipped open the phone.  The screen was filled with some strange-looking black icon in the middle, on a green background, bordered by orange-and-yellow diagonal stripes, like a biohazard sign.  chirp...  chirp...  chirp...  Jake rubbed at his sleepy face.  ""This had better not be costing minutes,"" he said, and pressed the button that would normally either clear the message, accepting it, or open it.  Whatever it was, Jake was miserably curious.  It was 2:20 AM on a Saturday, and Jake Sheldon was reading some strange message that had no obvious sender nor receiver: 'X'kar deshane'.  chirp...chirp...chirp...  The young man rolled back into bed, on his back, holding the phone in the air over his face, trying to make sense of what this meant.  ""'X'kar deshane',"" he tried to mouth the words, and felt them come out very well.    chirp chirp chirp  ""The hell is going on here?""   Jake rolled over to his side, laying the backlit phone glowing still on the bed beside him, trying to puzzle out what the biohazard like sign and the strange noises meant he'd never heard before.  CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP  Jake nearly leaped out of bed at the sudden change in the pace of the chirp.  The phone was buzzing now, seemingly getting louder.  And it clicked in his head, right then, that he not only knew what those words meant--X'kar deshane--but the language made sense to him.  Because he was fluent.  Knowledge thunked into Jake's head.  X'kar deshane...  ""Xeno-threat warning!""  Jake yelled, throwing off the covers.  CHIRRRRRPPPPP  Jake launched himself out of bed a second before his bedroom window shattered inwards, and some black, sleek form breached his bedroom.  Jake didn't look back, but he did slam the door on the way out.  Didn't help.  The xeno shattered the door, coming into the dim hallway's nightlight, revealing itself to be some massive spider analogue that went on six legs instead of eight.  And fangs.  Huge fangs.  Jake didn't care to see what else it was, because it was out to kill him, he was sure.  The young man was glad for the modern luxuries of linoleum flooring, causing the xeno to skitter and slip, losing ground on Jake.  ""Dad!""  Jake yelled.  ""Dad!!""  The second time, he was sure he was screaming.  Jake burst into the darkened living room, and tripped over one of his little sister's--Alice's--toy trains, causing the young man to stumble and flail his arms.  Human hands snagged his arm, and yanked him down violently down, giving Jake rugburn.  Jake looked up.  ""Jacob?""  he realized.  His older brother, almost college-aged, was crouched behind the couch.  Jacob had one hand up with a finger to his lips, signaling Jake for silence, and the other holding a chrome heavy weapon Jake had never seen before.  ""Hey, xenoshit,"" Jake heard his Dad, Gerald, say.  ""Blush.""    Something whined, and blue light lit up the living room for a moment, followed by a loud searing noise and fast, violent skittering that ceased after a few seconds.  Jake looked up at Jacob, then across the living room, around the edge of the couch, to his Dad.  ""Dad!"" he said.  ""What--""  Gerald had an even bigger but duller-looking gun than Jacob's held in two hands.  The muzzle was still glowing a slight tinge of blue.  ""Jacob,"" Gerald said.  ""Take your little brother and get into the basement.  You know the passcode.""  ""Dad--""  Jake protested.  ""Go.""  Jake, insanely bewildered, let his older brother lead him into the basement.  The younger brother saw only a clump of darkness from where he thought the xeno was last.  chirp...  chirp...  chirp...  Jake realized he had never let go of the phone.  Glancing down at it, he realized what the black symbol in the middle was: an icon of a xeno.  ""It's proximity software,"" Jacob said once they were downstairs.  ""Freeware in the rest of the galaxy, actually.""  ""Wha--  What?""  Jake said.  ""Dad'll fill you in, like he did for me,"" the older brother said as he opened the fuse box, then opened the inside of the fuse box, too, revealing a small monitor glowing black with green, ghostly letters.  ""Mom and Alice coming?"" Jacob said as he punched in a sequence of numbers.  ""Uh...""  Jake looked back upstairs.   Their Mom, Carol, was coming downstairs with little Alice in her arms.  Neither was armed, and Carol seemed frightened compared to Jacob's calm demeanor.  ""Yeah,"" Jake replied.  ""They're down here.""  He looked back to his brother.  ""What's going on?""  Jake had finished inputting whatever passcode he'd learned from their Dad, and, in reaction, the basement's brown, cold stone walls disfigured from plain physicality to a vortex of some white-and-gold energy.  ""The family business, apparently,"" Jacob said.  Jacob shoved his little brother into the vortex, without Jake's consent, in the most big brother way possible.  Jack came out the other side screaming in fright.  One moment, he was in his family's basement, and the next, he was on the bridge of what looked like a US Navy ship.  Except out the windows were stars.  Jake just stared, dumbfounded.  Jacob and Gerald came through next, pushing a screaming Carol and a crying Alice in front of them.    ""See them to a seat, son,"" Gerald told Jacob.  Once the older brother was complying, Gerald came over, still holding the big gun in one hand, and laid his free hand gently on Jake's shoulder.  ""Son,"" Jake's father said.  ""We have a lot to talk about."""
SimplePrompts,3cno3t,Xais56,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:59:48 2015 UTC,"""Shhh!!"" They said. ""We mustn’t talk here its forbidden!!"" Angie whispered to me as we hid under the staircase in old man Jameson’s giant mansion. “If they catch us we are done for!!!” She said in whisper so loud it was almost yelling. “Angie what do we do now”? I said as I dropped to one knee trying to get a better view of the hallway. “Look, for now we keep walking slowly until we find that map”.   The map in question, was an old one from the late 1300’s when the Spanish explorers set out to find the lost sword of Revailia, they mapped their journey on an old piece of parchment. It is said the map ends just before they locate the sword since it was found 200 years later uncompleted and in bad shape. “We came in thru the window near the Kitchen, Mark said the map was in his office located inside an old law book” I said. Mark used to be old man Jameson’s assistant until he was caught in bed with his daughter Jane. Old man Jameson did not approve of such a couple so he fired him and told him to never be in the presence of his daughter again.  Mark deep inside never like the old man, so in order to spite him he planned to steal his most prized possession. Angie and Jonny where the perfect kids for the job. Orphaned by age 10 they both steal form stores and outside stands just to be able to survive. They were quite good at it too. He told them where it was and even offered some reward money for getting the job done.   “According to Mark” Jonny said in a tone so low Angie had to edge closer to hear, “the loft was to the right when you climb the staircase” he finished. “All right then, I’ll go first be on the lookout” Angie said as she started to climb the staircase. She was the quicker one of the two and could outrun Jonny in a split second.  Suddenly, as Angie was at the top of the staircase, Jonny heard a door start to open. From where he was standing, the door was in direct sight. “If I don’t move now I’ll be caught red handed” he thought nervously. He darted up the stairs, ignoring his sister’s silent remarks to stop moving. He made it to the top as soon as the door swung open. “WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH Y-” Angie started to say as Jonny covered her mouth. Making pressing his finger to his lips indicating to be quiet.  “I dare say Johnson that was a remarkable game of golf” Angie and Jonny could hear an older gentleman say to no one. “He must be on the phone” thought Jonny. They assume the man in the kitchen to be Old man Johnson since they have never actually seen the man in person. “Let’s pick it up again next week shall we?” He continued speaking and closing his phone as he was finishing up.   “Jonny felt a tug on his back collar as Angie was motioning him to a door on the right. Opening it they saw a small well-furnished office with a big wooden ebony desk to the back of the room, a small old well detailed dark green couch on the right wall, a small coffee table with old newspapers and cigar butts on an ash tray and book case filled from top to bottom in what looks like different sets of volumes. “It must be hidden in one of those books” Angie said as she started to cross the room to the left. Jonny started walking to the desk as a small wooden box, enlaced with gold trimming caught his eye. He opened it an inside was a rather peculiar little trinket. A hexagonal metal piece roughly the size of a quarter. The piece itself was silver with a small rise on each point of the piece and four holes in the middle, two small diamond shaped on the top and bottom and two circular shapes on the left and right. “This could be useful he thought to himself as he pocketed the box and walked towards Angie.  “The laws and regulation of Marquee County courts circa 1857” This looks incredibly boring said Angie. It must be it.” To their surprise a small piece of old parchment was folded in between the middle. Jonny opened the old paper delicately and inscribed within was an old map with what looks like pathways in between forests and ruins. “HA found it!” Angie exclaimed loudly. Without realizing old man Johnson was climbing the stairs due to their search for the map they heard him walking towards the office door. “Miriam is that you?” Johnson said surprisingly “I thought you cleaned out that room yesterday” he continued. “He is right there!” Jonny said with panic in his voice. “Leave it and go!” He told Angie as he was rushing towards the open window.   “Miriam why didn’t you answer m-?” Johnson said as the door swung open. “Hmmph, must be getting older than I thought he said realizing there was no one in the room. He turned to leave when a book on the floor caught his eye. “Dumb maid must’ve dropped it cleaning out bookcase” he said in an annoyed tone. “Ill have to give her a stern talk once I see her-…WHERE IS THE BOX”? He yelled realizing the small box on his desk was gone. Leaping out of the room he screamed at the top of his lungs “MIRIAM YOU INCOPETENT MAID, REPORT TO ME THIS INSTANT!” Old man Johnson said as his voice trailed out from within earshot.   “Well…that was a close one”. Joked Jonny as he and Angie got up from under the desk. “Well what do you say Jonny? How about we go deliver this to Mark and go get our money?” “Yea” said Jonny in quick response. “I’m sick of sneaking around”. “C’mon then, lets climb thru this window and onto the tree” Angie said. “There is no way I’m going thru the kitchen again, Mark said old man Johnson has gun stashes hidden throughout the house” “Fine then lets make it quick, don’t want to disappoint that punk Mark”. Together they made their way out the window and down the tree. Jonny hasn’t told Angie about the box and wouldn’t for a while. Little did he know that box and the small hexagonal metal piece would unlock the door to an epic adventure from whom they will never forget….."

SimplePrompts,3cjrnz,Blink182Ruelzz,4,Wed Jul 8 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"I am sitting congruent to the chair, opposite an old CRT TV encased in a fine layer of dust. Some politician is talking, and in his voice I think I hear a kind of sombreness to it, but I can’t be certain. My attention is being diverted by how uncomfortable I am making myself, sitting up, back straight and with the barrel of a .357 in my mouth.  My body is shaking. Over the sound of cars passing by outside and the politician’s speech is my own laboured breathing, teeth clanking against the cold steel that tastes like carbon. I pull back the hammer and it clicks reassuringly, but then there's this feeling that I can’t quite determine like having lost something without knowing what that lost thing ever was, and it’s overwhelming me to the point that I shut my eyes, teeth biting down now and hard on the barrel, my thumb hovering just above the trigger, ready, the sounds surrounding me becoming almost unbearable. But something stops me.  I moan as I pull the gun out of my mouth and droop forwards, spittle falling onto the oil-stained garage floor. I’m crying and whining pathetically, I know, but I can’t figure out or articulate anything, only succumb to the helplessness. From the CRT TV comes intermittent talk. I wipe my face with one lightly-haired arm and look up at the TV, sitting in a position where I’m hunched forwards spectacularly, elbows on the insides of my knees with the gun hanging in between.  Then there are raised voices shouting no, don’t do it, and I see that they come from the CRT, the politician having pulled out a gun of his own and refuting those voices: no, don’t, someone might get hurt. I know those voices aren’t for me, but I can’t help being entranced, eyes still stinging somewhat, and now I’m watching intently someone actually going through with the same thing I had just failed to do. And he does it, gun going off and everything, him slumping down as blood flows freely from every orifice in his face and from the top of his open head. Someone screams shrilly and another swears.  The camera focuses in on the dead politician, and I’m sitting here in my little garage, not knowing what to think or what to do or anything really. It was like watching your own self, your own actions become manifest, and I am left wondering if this is a cosmic joke of some kind. Through the screen, someone says to call an ambulance.  I decide to leave it for one more day."

SimplePrompts,3cjuvw,Dodgiestyle,2,Wed Jul 8 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"The Executor and his henchmen had invaded the temporal monastery. The wooden staircase that spiraled up the inner wall of the clock tower carried the reverberations of their ponderous boots, and long before they reached the top, the alarm was sounded and the abbot summoned. Unfortunately, there was little he could do.  The abbot drew himself up and spread his bangled arms wide, as if to barricade the archway. “Halt,” he cried, “or I will turn your whiskers to gossamer, your eyes to pearls, and your bones to matchsticks!”  “That would not be wise,” responded the Executor. “I have been sent by His Majesty to indict your disciple Ignatius for the ten million counts of murder that he is to commit.”  “O wicked absurdity! O heretical incursion!” bellowed the abbot. “Interlopers, begone! This monastery administers its own justice.”  “This monastery will not do as you claim,” the Executor declared. “It has been foreseen that this monstrous crime will be committed, which it would not be if you clock-winders had prevented it. Now stand aside, so my men and I may carry out the justice yours will not.”  The abbot swayed back and forth with the oscillations of the great pendulum, but held his ground. “Never,” he vowed.  Four black-robed men standing behind the Executor raised their hands and chanted “IUSTITIA OBSTRUCTA,” and the abbot collapsed, head in his hands. They walked past him, unhindered, into the hollow heart of the clock itself.  The Executor’s men spread throughout the vaulted chamber, past the column of counterweights, over the teetering escapement, and under the gemstone-encrusted pointing hands. “IGNATIUS ACCUSATUS,” they intoned. “IGNATIUS CRIMINATUS. IGNATIUS CULPATUS.” The other monks could have interfered, but were struck dumb with terror. Some cowered behind the carapace of a colossal bell, while others called upon their clocks and fled into a different time entirely. And thus Ignatius was brought forth, wrists pinioned in one of the goons’ meaty grip.  “What lunacy is this?” Ignatius bleated. “What impiety?”  The Executor faced him. “Brother Ignatius of the Temporal Order,” he demanded, “what know you of the Thousand Years’ War?”  “What is there to know?” he protested. “There has never been a Thousand Years’ War!”  “Not yet. But at the turn of the season, there will come a traveler from the far lands in the East, a nobleman on a journey to treat with His Majesty—”  “An Eastlander,” seethed Ignatius, “like the Eastlander who killed my father, abducted my mother, and left me an orphan!”  “Hold your tongue,” barked the Executor. “The diplomat will be lodging in the town below, and upon the stroke of midnight, an assassin will break into his room at the inn and strike him dead. There will therefore be no treaty, and the civilizations of the East will blame the court of His Majesty for the crime. A war will erupt from their dispute, of a magnitude that has never been witnessed, a war that will rage for ten centuries, and it will be known to the ages as the Thousand Years’ War, and will claim millions of lives in both the West and the East, and condemn the great achievements of our time to insignificance!”  “O happenstance, O lamentable misfortune, et cetera. Why do you tell me this tale?”  “Because it is you, vainglorious reprobate! You are the one who starts the war that will shatter history!”  Whispers of shock and disbelief echoed around the room. Ignatius, however, put up no argument, and showed not a scrap of remorse for his predicted deeds. “Gibbering fools!” he muttered.  “Take his watch,” ordered the Executor. The monks hiding behind the old bell gasped and made the sign of the pointing hands over their hearts. One of the goons searched Ignatius’ habit and extracted his golden pocketwatch, large as a goblet and equally ostentatious. He raised it overhead—the watching monks covered their faces—and smashed it on the floor, scattering gears and springs into the crevices of the wood grain.  “Ignatius, you are hereby stripped of your chronological abilities, and sentenced to live the rest of your days one moment after the next, as would any common man.”  But the monk did not hang his head or cede his habit. “Simpletons!” he taunted them. “Have you forgotten where I stand?”  “Where do you stand, Ignatius, formerly of the Temporal Order?” the Executor asked.  “Inside a clock,” crowed Ignatius, and with that he made his final invocation and vanished into the annals of time."

SimplePrompts,3ciihu,hostushostilius,2,Wed Jul 8 08:41:58 2015 UTC,"It was 6:45 AM when the dreaded beep awoke him. Siezed from the warm embrace of sleep, Stan fumbled wearily with the alarm.   ""Rise and shine,"" a voice beside him said.  He turned quickly to see Eugene, wearing his usual red flannel and a particularly wry smile. Both rising and shining had proven to be diffucult of late; only the arrival of Eugene had brought back the spark that Stan believed was gone forever.  ""Today is your big day!""  The words, though spoken in genuine excitement, stirred emotions deep inside of Stan. He knew with a grim assurance that Eugene would be the only one to ackowledge his 17th birthday.   No, his mother may make a passing remark while putting minimal effort into masking her obvious disapointment. He decided to avoid the possibility, skipping his usual cereal and waiting in his room for the strained sound of her car engine. Two weeks ago he made the same wait alone.  But now he had Eugene.  ""What are you going to wear?"" Eugene said, face still dominated by a smile. He began rifling through Stan's open wardrobe. ""You have to look your best, this is the beginning of the rest of your life!""  Stan began to feel uneasy. Eugene was his best friend, but in a way he was only making matters worse. His presence began as a blessing, a light in the shadows that threatened to eat Stan alive.He had imagnary friends growing up, like most children do, but Eugene defied the accepted schema. Even when Stan wasn't imagining him, he was there. He existed in physical space. Stan could see him. Stan could touch him.   But that was nonsense, of course. There wasn't really a blue-clad man sitting in the back of his classroom. There wasn't really a smiling face across from him as he ate his lunch in silence. And yet, there he was.  ""Oh, good choice,"" he said as Stan pulled some jeans and a T-shirt out of the wardrobe. ""All eyes on you today!""  Oh God he hoped not. The past few years had taught him to avoid attention, be it good or bad.  He emerged from his bedroom once he heard the telltale rumbling, followed closely by his blue shadow. As he began his walk towards the front door, he fought the urge to turn around, sensing Eugene had left his side. ""No,"" he though sullenly. ""I know what I'll see.""  ""Forgetting something?"" As if on cue, Eugene beckoned him to a drawer beneath the sink, his smile almost wicked. Although he tried to continue on his path, Stan found himself turning towards the kitchen against his will. He knew what he would find inside, but the morbid corner of his brain that housed Eugene compelled him to act.  Inside the drawer his hand was met with cold steel. The appendage withdrew, and with it came a heaviness that weighed more on his soul than his fingers. His thoughts flashed to the cold brick walls of a classroom and the smug young faces it contained. ""Be bold,"" Eugene said softly. ""Show them what their malice brings.""  But the malice he saw was in the face of Eugene, his own face, twisted into its omnipresent smile. He slowly brought the barrel to his head, meeting the gaze of the evil that stood before him. And he just barely noticed the smile change before he was finally free."

He sat beside the bushes in the dirt and watched the beagle sniffing. Dewy grass and moonlight down the lane of white-barked ash trees. A heavy moon in the sky, one good for howling. Holding a beer almost empty, another few in the dirt beside him, he took slow sips and slow breaths.  She made the bed, organizing the pillows. The kitchen light was left on. He'd left it on. She had clicked the lamp minutes ago and adjusted to the dark. Open drapes let the moonlight in. White light. No candles on a night like tonight. Nothing to do but sit now, or sleep. She was used to him, somber and familiar with this--he'd be back late. But rooms hold tension after fights abate, and she was no woman to linger alone. The light of a television in the living room.  He followed the dog when it strayed, the empty fields and looming trees no danger for a boy who'd grown up here. The smell of green and wet in the air. Dark sky and dark ground. Dark colored hound with drooping ears and happy eyes, panting in the air, shaking his collar. Panting white puffs of steam.   Sometimes there are too many words and a lack is needed. A space or a period of quiet..  She will wait for him and he will return."

SimplePrompts,3cflnt,thisisnotariot,5,Tue Jul 7 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"Something has been taken from the world. A vast something; an inarticulable significance. I simply can’t work out how to convey what it is. It’s on the tip of my tongue.  I’m standing in the laboratory, gazing helplessly at the smooth chrome curves of the machine that got us into this mess. It’s a universe machine: an unprecedented device granting full command over space and time. We designed and assembled it in this very lab, and yesterday (if you could call it that) we brought it online for the inaugural test run. As the head of the lab, it was my honor to flip the switch that initialized the testing sequence. It was my team, my machine, and therefore my fault that something was removed from existence during that test.  All around me, researchers, mathematicians, and engineers are scurrying back and forth, running more experiments, ransacking storage cabinets, and activating and deactivating other devices. They mumble sounds of distress, their heads heavy, their eyes telegraphing panic.   The test was supposed to be a non-event. It was a simple diagnostic: boot up, scan the complete history of the universe, shut down. No changes of any kind were to be made. We’d simulated it a hundred times already and our sandbox universe, the dummy we used to host our tests, was none the worse for it. Unfortunately we must have missed some vital difference between our sandbox and the real thing. The test did change something, whether a massive blow that shattered history or a fraction of a moment that reverberated through time. If we could only find an explanation for what happened, or—luck be with us—instructions for how to reverse it.   Theories rattle around in my head: It might have been an electrical short, or a miscalculation of dimensional curvature. Or perhaps it was a quantum decoherence effect; the birth of our universe had been unobserved until we scanned it with the machine. We could have collapsed the wave function early, turning probabilistic soup into a particular plasma of elementary particles, breaking the symmetry of matter and antimatter. We might have traveled back and, by merely watching, retroactively created a different universe. Our feelings of loss might be an effect of having leapt into another existence than the one where we were born.  I shake off my brooding thoughts; anticipation has taken hold of the room. Someone on my team has discovered something. It’s my timid intern who bears the precious finding: a thick packet with an image of a curvaceous silver device clearly imprinted on the front page. Our complete documentation! I take hold of the packet and flip through it with trembling hands.   There are no words. The manual for the universe machine is blank."

SimplePrompts,3cflnt,illbzo1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"This is a continuation of a post I did to a previous SimplePrompt, which was I am the vessel. I might keep it going in this subreddit through different prompts if I can. Here's the first part: https://www.reddit.com/r/SimplePrompts/comments/3cc5i6/i_am_the_vessel/csu9tfm  Cynwrig stumbled forward, clutching the gash at his side, but despite wounds, he would press on, for his goal was not far. He threw the door before him open, greeted by the sight of four palace guards surrounding a man who had dared to call Aurora his daughter even after forcing her to become the sacred vessel in his place, knowing that she would die. Finding his resolve, he stepped forward, still holding the broken knife meant for spilling her blood.  ""Stop, there, you! I'll--I'll double your payment for the task.""  ""There are no words,"" he spat, blood and spittle dripping down his chin. Images of her smiles followed by her tears tightened his grip on the dagger's hilt. ""No words can be said to right your wrongs."" A guard lunged towards him from one side as another struck from the other, but Cyn grabbed the arm of the man closing in and tossed him into the swinging axe of the other and heard the man grunt as the sword that had been spearing for Cyn's neck pierced the man's gut, then kicked so that they fell into the ground.  ""I-it was for the good of all of us. The world was crumbling, and the prophecy--""  ""There are no words to hide your wickedness behind righteousness!"" he hissed through gritted teeth, remembering Aurora's somber resolve wavering as she faced her ultimate fate, the fate she had hid from him as he slowly came to love her. Another guard stepped forward with an overhand swing, but Cyn quickly moved around the strike and thrust his dagger through the man's neck while calming stalking forward.  ""You must understand, it is the duty of a priestess to become the vessel in times of chaos. The others had all fled! She was--!""  ""There are no words to save you, High Priest. She was your daughter, or so you both claimed, yet I only know that you are a coward--perhaps you were not even worthy of becoming the vessel anyway."" The final guard lowered his sword to the protest and pleas of the priest, and Cynwrig fell upon him, hands around his throat wringing the life from him, until the struggle ended with a violent snap.   It was over. Everything was over, but he knew there were no words to comfort him in this life. He rolled over, drawing heavy breaths into suddenly pained lungs. It was hard to tell where the blood of others ended and his blood began, but it didn't matter anymore. He had achieved his goal. A last flash of the light slipping from her brilliant eyes as he held her in the fountain, and then he finally bowed his head, welcoming the rest to follow. His eyes closed with a smile.  .  When his eyes opened, he was somewhat disappointed to find the drab colorings of a prison instead of the fabled halls of the afterlife."

Whatever this is, it isn't meant for us to read.” He shook his can and threw it in the pile of empties. ”I don't suppose you brought more of those?”  Linda looked at him. She reminded him of a racehorse when she was stressed, her nostrils opening and closing with ther breath, her head shaking ever so sligtly, making her hair wave. The curlshake, he called it. One day he would gather his courage and tell her about it. Some other day.  ”What do you mean? Waste of time? I got shot at, Eddie. I think I may have killed a man, dammit. Just so I could hang on to this... pamphlet or whatever it is. I promise you, someone thinks it's pretty important. They thrashed my appartment, Eddie. I've been running for my life for three god damn days while you've been drinking my beer in here. I'll get fired if they find out, you know that? You'll have to give me something just a little bit better than... waste of time.”  Edgar picked the book up again. It felt as strange as i looked. At first, the pages seemed to try to attach themselves to his fingertips, so he started wearing a pair of Linda's cotton gloves at all times when he handled it. He was pretty sure that it wasn't even made of paper. ”Look, I know you don't want to tell me where or how you got your hands on this, but I have nothing to work with. There are no words here”.  ”No words? It must mean something?”  ”Maybe it does, but so far all I have is symbols. I ran it through every database I have access to, plus a few which I don't, and there isn't anything in any of them which resembles this, not even a little bit.” He opened the book on a random page and showed it to Linda. ”See? They're not even lined up or anything. It's a mess.”  ”What about patterns? There must be some logic to it somehow.” She paused. ”I know... you're the expert and I'm the courier. Save that frown for later.”  He shook his head. ”No patterns. Every single one of these signs is unique. All... let me check... twenty two thousand, seven hundred and five of them. It's quite a feat when you think about it, coming up with so many different kinds of horseshit which nobody has ever seen before.”  ”Could it be some sort of alphabet? Twenty K characters isn't so much if you ask in China or Korea.”  Edgar stood up, took a step sideways, found his balance. He looked at the pile of empty cans. Fair enough. Better slow down a bit. He peeked through the blinds, to the street below.  ”It could be an alphabet. It could be someone's three year old child who made a notebook full of doodles. It could be the codes to the nukes. Either way, I'm out of ideas for now.”  Linda studied Edgar for a few moments, then put the kettle on. ”So what's our next move?”  ”You could tell me how you got it, real quick, and we work from there. Or we can go down to the parking lot and ask your new friends in the Toyota what it's all about. I don't suppose you have an extra gun on you?”  ”Fuck.”  ”Yea.”"
SimplePrompts,3cd0di,CubesCubed,2,Mon Jul 6 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"She was more than an android. Most people could not tell the difference of her and a normal human being. But I saw it. She was a new model of the MPAR Maiden series. Consistently, they were the best at what they did; and that was to simply be.   She had been activated prior to my meeting her, and for some reason, she had been disowned. For androids, it meant much more than simply being put out for scrap. This means they had lost their purpose, their drive. She had nowhere else to go. What else was I to do than log her as mine? She was beautiful. She didn't seem broken in any way. It was as if... someone simply saw her as a machine, rather than a person.   But they are human. The manufactured soul, something thought up by one of the early android and robotic legends had become something easily made. They are just as human as I am. I can't let a human starve on the street. I can't let a woman, in tattered clothes, cuts and scrapes all over her, be allowed to live on the street and run from the Collector.   Back at my apartment, we sat in quiet solace.   ""..."" Silence was all she had to offer at the moment. She was in a place unknown to her. She had only known the confines of the last resident she was stationed at. The Maiden series are just that, a woman to oogle at, to fawn over, to swoon. Others use they as artificial girlfriends, and still others use them for... It's too much for me to say. Regardless, I had a beauty in synthetic skin and warm copper eyes staring at me, awaiting for me to say something.   ""I... Is everything alright?"" I ask sheepishly. She seemed zoned out, nervous, or scared.   ""Why...?"" She began quietly, ""Why did master not want me anymore?""   At a loss for words, I try to explain, but it goes nowhere. There are too many reasons why a person may throw an android away. Eventually, I simply say, ""He was done with you it seemed. I'm sorry to ask, but... would you want another master?""   This question, always the hardest, is never answered how I really want it. A simple yes or no is never the answer I get; and this time was no different.   ""I... I have to get another master?"" Tears, real tears, began to well in her eyes.   ""Since he doesn't want you... Yeah. You have to. It is terrible, them throwing you away like that... but you do need another master... Or... you could do something else...""   The sobbing began then. I can't stand the sound. It hurts my heart. Every time I hear it, it's like nails to a chalkboard. Soon, she stops, and, just like the others... asks the same question.   ""What's the something else?""   ""I could unlock you. You could be free. You could have no master, and you could be... well... normal.""   ""You mean... I could be a human?""   ""You already are that. This way, you will have more control over yourself. You'll be able to do what you want. You don't have to answer to anyone. You would be your own master.""   Her eyes lit up, the light back in them. The tears, gone and her eyes left shimmering in the dim light of the apartment. Her warm metallic eyes look back to me, a gleam of hope in them. She begins a smile, for the first time in the hours she has spent with me, and she says.   ""I... I want to be free."""

Sef looked over towards the house, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary - except for the fact that it wasn't built yet. It was complete enough in that you could see the overall shape of the house, but it didn't even have a roof or walls, or even a driveway.  ""Bon, and how do you know -""  ""Fairy intuition.

At this point the poor fairy curled up into a ball, rocking back and forth but still facing the work-in-progress house. Sef has seen Bon acted up this way only once before, and that was with a half empty jar of honey. Bon refused to even go near the shelf where it was until Sef explain that is was just honey, and not a capture device for acidic slime monsters.  So with a deep breath, Sef turned to Bon once again, and calmly said ""But Bon, it's just a ho-""  ""HOUSE OF A MURDER?! YEAH ITS JUST YOUR EVERYDAY MURDER SHACK! CAUSE THAT'S NORMAL!"" Bon screamed out, now spinning around on her bottom like a break dancer.  ""But Bo-"" this time Sef got interrupted by the now crying-at-the-top-of-her-lungs-while-spinning-at-top-speed fairy that was now on display on his shoulder.  ""Bon!"" Sef said in a raised voice, while stopping the fairy top with his finger, ""The house isn't even done being built yet.""  With a tear in her eye, and still looking distressed Bon asked, ""and not for the souls to leave once they have been murdered?""  ""Why would - err yes Bon. Yes, not because of the souls"" Sef sighed.    This story has the same characters as my last story here, and honestly I just enjoy writing how these two play off of each other. I might turn this into a full story of some sort later on."

The low drone pierced her consciousness and stained each fabric of her mind with the somber blue tones of longing. Generators, purifiers, ventilators; an orchestra of machines that had guarded her since birth was now drowning her in a sea of sound. The sea was always there, of course, but she had always floated gently above it, blisfully unaware of the rising tides.   She was nine years old when she first experienced the sun's brilliant warmth. The thick exterior hull had been breached, exposing a mesmerizingly foreign shade of blue. The heat was unlike any she had ever felt; her existence until this point had consisted of alternating states of 'FAN ON' and 'FAN OFF'. The tangible sensation of warmth on her skin sent an alien sort of energy throughout her being. Her mind reverted to a more primal, instinctive state, and her indoctrinated wariness of the outside world abandoned her.  She was among the few that left the chamber unscathed. The sun's radiation had passed through the atmosphere unopposed, entering the broken layer of steel and permeating the bodies that seeked refuge underneath. She escaped without a single burn or tumor, leaving only with the vision of that dazzling shade of blue.  Ten years had passed, yet her mind still strayed to thoughts of the beautiful world above her. It was a world of silence, a land without the dull cacophony of man's creation. She spent her days imagining a way to reclaim Earth's blue skies. And as she drifted to sleep, her steel walls slowly faded and gave way to expanses of mountains, rivers, and streams."

You'll never find the peace you crave if you run from what brings you in. ""Thank you for the encouragement"" I am only here to help.

That was the prophecy recited for years in children's tales, which is all that Cynwrig believed them to be until the day the land ruptured, bleeding monsters and demons, and the mark on his hand appeared to declare him as Chosen. Finally they had reached the fountain, little more than a small spring that seemed to glow of its own accord surrounded by flora he had never seen before. Within the still waters was a swirling darkness that threatened to steal away the pool's light.  With a smile, he looked over to his beautiful companion, Aurora, to find a mixture of relief and dread confounding her delicate features. ""Come,"" he outstretched his hand, ""give me the vessel, and I will end all of this, and we can go home--perhaps even together!""  A small smile brightened her face as her eyes fluttered over to him, but only briefly, for the fountain demanded her gaze. In a small, quivering voice, she said, ""I must do this alone. W-we must part now, dear Cyn; hardships aside, I've enjoyed the last six months traveling with you.""  For a moment, Cynwrig didn't believe what she was saying. We must part? Yet there is only one path down the mountain--even if she must be alone, she would surely leave the same way. He opened his mouth to say as much, then saw the tears forming in her eyes. ""Aurora, what's wrong? What do you know that I do not?""  As she looked again at him, he could feel her resolve break as the tears began to stream down her pale cheeks. Holding up the small vial of glowing liquid she kept in her dress, she barely whispered, ""This is not the vessel, but a token for you to take before the court in exchange for payment for your deeds. The truth is....I am the vessel.""  Cynwrig was taken aback. Aurora the... ""Then...?""  She nodded, quoting the ancient words, ""the vessel shall empty itself into the waters--you were...only an escort."" She stepped towards the glowing, hungry pool, pulling a dagger from the folds of her dress.  ""NO!"" he shouted, rushing forward, but the land ruptured, lurching him towards the edge. He could see the mark on the world widen beneath the mountain, larger devils pouring out, and an enormous hand breach the rim. For a moment, he lay there dumbfounded, until a gasp caught his attention. Behind him he saw that Aurora had fallen as well--the dagger planted firmly in her chest. Blood spilled out, not red but silver, inching towards the pool. As he scampered to her side, he moved to pull it out, but her hand caught his, and their eyes met. It was too late, he knew, and despite the pain, her resolve had returned. With a slight nod and no small amount of tears of his own, he carried her into the pool.  Later  The sky and land had sealed, the bleeding wound now a pale scar. Cynwrig held the bottle of liquid he had thought to be the vessel for half a year. Now, it was only something to turn in for coin. It seemed not to belong in his dirt covered hands. No, it doesn't, he thought as it shattered, and with one last look at the mound of dirt and marker above it next to him, he set back on a trek back to the men who sent Aurora to die, her dagger in hand.

Her hair matted, her eyes, bright with grief and madness.   The sun penetrated through the gap in the curtains. Like cancer , the cot and the toys and the books so small that they fit in the palm of her hand polluted the immaculately painted, light blue wall of the room. The cot projected bars into the face of the women. Mumbling incoherrently, she reached one pale hand to the window, and jerked the curtain closed. She let out a sigh of relief, for the sun, which fed the plants with her milk and had, at the start of every spring, hailed the shoots of anew which snaked out of the ground, squinting their half shut eyes into this bright world of unfamiliarity they had just entered, could torment her no more.   Oh, how she longed to be out lying in the grass, in spring, with roots prickling her back and the sun shining upon her bloated belly. She has felt so full then, a chalice brimming with holy water, a cup dripping with wine. Like the trees, she was fruitful, for inside of her, her child grew. She had imagined it, floating ethereally in its pickling juice, its limbs loosing their translucent glow, it's veins filling with blood, until she could almost feel its heartbeat, synchronised with her own.   But one day, perhaps when she was too pre-occupied with carefully arranging the cushions in the cot, the body which had shielded the baby turned malicious, it turned from her, poisoning the liquid in which the baby was floating in. The rhythmic breathing, that had once been as clear as the beat of a drum slowed and faded silently into nothingness, the blood flowing from his veins turned blue, and she could just see her child drowning, slowly drowning, in this body which seemed to hate her so.

They don't understand that my body is alive and always watching, always observing. They come and go from their domiciles but they never pay me any mind. But how could they? Like I said, they don't fully understand my presence.   Fortunately for me, some of them are more careful about how they treat my body. But then there the others who don't care enough to do the same and I hate them for it. But I have no direct way of taking care of them.   The staff and the superintendent here can do that, they can handle those who are lazy or don't care. So I don't worry about that as much. My only focus is my observation of those inside my body and learning more about them, their secrets, their beliefs, what they do, etc.  And if the opportunity arises, I'll take advantage of any ways to do direct harm to those who hurt me.

Blount hesitated a split second, surprised, then let the budget report he was carrying drop to the floor as his right hand darted to his holster, hands closing around the peebled grip as he pulled the firearm free and brought it up into a two handed Weaver stance, sights settling square and steady on the stained flannel shirt worn by the old man.  ""Drop the fuckin' gun!"" Blount shouted, finger beginning to tighten on the trigger. He had no clear shot though, not with the mayor in between him and the old man who looked vaugley familiar.  Mayor Bright was pale as a ghost, white skin covered in sweat, terror in his eyes. ""A bomb,"" he croaked, ""Herman's got a bomb, don't shoot! God, don't shoot!""  Blount hesitated as the old man grinned a toothless smile and took a swig from his bottle. He recognized him now, Herman Cupp, old Herman who worked as a janitor for the school board, old Herman whose son Calvin has died years ago in Brushy Mountain after going up for rape. That had been Brights idea, conceived after a night of too much drinking, too much debauchery . Calvin had been a small-time ""journalist"" for the towns rinky-dink radio station and in a state of cocaine fueled paranioa the mayor had imagined the young reporter was on to their drug smuggling operation. He had begged Blount to kill him, had ordered him to but Blount thought the kid harmless but when Alicia at the diner had been raped and her description had sounded like the poor reporter Blount had used the opportunity to take care of the problem. Calvin had landed in prison and in his first year had pissed off a biker from Nashville so bad that the desperado had used to a shank made from a fire hardened tooth-brush to settle the matters. Poor Calvin Cupp had bleed to death in the yard as a Tennessee summer storm washed his life blood away.   ""Well,"" Cupp slurred, stumbling a little, ""here comes the po-lice to take me away."" He laughed, ""You going to frame me for rape like you did my boy?""  ""Your boy was guilty. Alicia testified and all the evidence was there."" Blount tried to look as innocent as possible. Yes, Alicia had testified but she had been so high when it happened she was hardly a credible witness. And the evidence he had manipulated.   ""Bullshit! My boy was a saint!"" The old man let his bottle drop to the floor as tears came to his eyes. Before Blount could react he yanked a device from his shirt pocket that looked like a TV remote.  ""What is that Herman?"" Fear in his voice, Blount knew. From the sobbing coming from the mayor he knew too.  ""This,"" Herman said, suddenly sounding very sober and  solemn.""is justice. This,"" he waggled the device. ""is a remote detonator. I know what Mayor Bright has done. Hell, half the town does but we're too afraid to do anything. It's simple, either the mayor dies or the bomb goes off. He either jumps off the damned chair or I press this red button and the middle school goes boom. Do you know why I'm giving him a chance to be a hero?""  ""This is crazy, Herman. But down the detonator and lets talk about this. No need for anyone to get hurt."" If the old man puts down the detonator I'm emptying my gun into him and mayor be damned. This was his fault anyway.  The old man smirked. ""I'm letting him be a hero because he wants to be one. Do you know he's been talking to the FBI?""  ""Thats not true!"" Bright bleated, voice strained with fear. ""Don't you listen to him!""  ""I waited and I prayed and I knew justice would get you and Bright. When his boy Andrew got caught for fraud I thought it would be the start, but this son of a bitch has been talking to the FBI, asking for a deal. What you think he's got to talk about?""  Blount spared a glance at Mayor Bright and he knew. His son had been arrested for wire fraud and he loved that boy like nothing else. All the things he had done with the mayor, all the crime...  ""Thats right Chief,"" Cupp mocked. ""he was going to sell you out and live out the rest of his life in peace as a witness. But my prayers were answered. I got the call last week. The big C my doctor said, don't have long so here we are. And since it looks like Mayor Bright here aint gonna be a hero after all...""Cupp pushed the button on the detonator and Blounts heart leapt to his throat and he screamed.  Nothing happened. No explosions in the distance. Nothing over Blounts portable radio about an explosion. Blount blinked, stunned and the mayor giggled.  ""Fuck."" Cupp let the detonator fall from his hands and dropped the shotgun.  Blount blinked again. Then he fired once, twice, and again into the old mans chest, the gunfire loud in the small office and the gun bucking slightly and the old man crumpled and gurgled as his life spread around him in a red halo on the beige government issue carpet.  ""Thank God! Get me down!"" Mayor Bright pleaded, a wet stain spreading across the front of his khakis.  Blount looked at him without pity. ""You really going to sell me out, Bright?"" He lit a cigarett while looking at the small man looking down on him with fear and he knew for sure. His leg flashed out and kicked the office chair out from under Bright and as the mayor jerked and gurgled Blount stood watching and smoked a cigarett as cool as ice.  It was protocol for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to investigate officer involved shootings in small towns and rural areas. It was they who noticed the web cam set up in the corner, they who found it before they received a call from the local TV stations about the aunthenticity of an e-mail sent from one H. Cupp that had a link to a cloud server that held a video of a police chief that had murdered two people in cold blood."

I wanted, no, I needed one final meal with my wife before we go ahead with the divorce. Sixteen years, SIXTEEN YEARS thrown away. I mentally prepared myself for something like this to happen back in my younger days, but for it to actually happen, for the divorce to actually take place just breaks my heart.  My soon to be ex-wife walked into the dining room, where I already had the food prepared. I didn't want to look at her, but staring at her with anger and disdain was cathartic for me. Baked chicken, greens, and macaroni, that was on the table. That's what we liked; we were simple people.  As she sat down, I had to break the ice, I had to end the silence. ""Was it worth it? Throw away sixteen years, and for what?""  ""Can we...can we please not do this,"" she asked sheepishly.  ""No,"" I respond in a firm tone, ""the least you can do is communicate with me. The least you can do is to just be honest with me. Sixteen years, all gone to waste! Just tell me, was it worth it?""  ""Was...was what worth it,"" she quietly questioned.  ""The sixteen god damn years! Was it worth it, yes or no?""  ""YES,"" she responded emphatically. ""I know the mistakes I've made, I know what my actions have done to you, to this family. YOU are the one who wants this divorce,"" she points out.  ""You are god damn right I want this divorce!""  ""So you're the one willing to just throw away sixteen years, not me,"" she said angrily.  ""What you've done will always be in the back of my mind. What am I supposed to do to trust you? You've broken that trust in the worst way imaginable, and now you walk around like a sad little puppy as if THAT will be enough to forgive you?""  ""I said I was sorry.""  ""Sorry doesn't cut it,"" I angrily respond. ""You've done so much damage, so much damage to me,"" I say while fighting back tears. ""There's a part of me that would be happy to see you dead."" She begins to cry. ""I just...I just can't get over this. I will never get over the fact that you are a Dallas Cowboys fan.""  ""I'm FROM that city,"" she yells at me.  ""THAT MAKES IT WORSE!""  The both of us go silent again. The once warm food is now cold. There are only three guarantees in life: death, taxes, and the Cowboys never winning the NFC East ever again. Go /r/EAGLES.    Again, I'm sorry. I'm so, so, so sorry. I just started laughing like a maniac at the idea of a husband and Eagles fan so petty that he's go through with this. I'm still giggling as I type.

I stared into her sorrowful brown eyes and patted her hair.  ""Do we weawwy have to move, Mommy?"" she asked me, her four-year old dialect still not quite right.  ""Yes, dear,"" I told her. ""Mommy doesn't have enough money to keep this house anymore."" I sighed inwardly. If only it were simple to have a house.  I've had to lie to her all this time. I've been telling her we're going to a good house, and we'll have good food and good money. But...that's not the truth. I have no money anymore, and they're kicking us out.

Hope makes you help the person who lives next to you, it makes you think that not everyone is bad. Hope gets you killed.

But every year, there is always at least one fool who gets the notion to actually come to The City, to take on a quest to see this fabled land up close.   And all those who embarked on this quest never did return. It went on for over a decade. Dozens of people lost to The City, vanished without a trace.   Until now.   I wipe my face and looked over the hill to the town I called home. The blinding heat of the sun and my lack of sleep for over a fortnight (or was it? it seemed longer) has drained my strength almost entirely, but I know I can't give up.

We watched that light on the horizon call to us day and night, beckoning us to someplace....different.  It was a promise of all the wonders in the world, of all the cultures we'd never experienced in our Town. It was a new tomorrow, where we could be anyone. The Town seemed so simple, so pedestrian that when we would climb down from that hill and go to supper our homes seemed smaller, our walls seemed dirtier and the day to day affairs of The Town seemed like the goings on of insects compared to the people of The City.  As we grew older The City remained, The City endured. But not all of us remained so determined, so steadfast in our hope for that brighter tomorrow. Some of us started to agree with the old timers and the cynics and the will of The Town. It's simpler here they said, stop being so childish they said, grow up and take some responsibility they said. Suddenly no one wanted to draw pictures of what we thought The City looked like on the inside. The others wanted to go to the mill or raise families.

The people dance by moonlight, glowing flowers in their hands, calling all the voices of the wind to bless their hallowed land. Though the songs are light and lilting, there are some who do not sing- they're the ones who came from past the stars, in firebirds, in spring.

I had never been here before; I was just passing through on my way to a job interview. The city was new to me, being on the other side of the country.  I walked to the front of the shop where a lone barista was serving a line of five or six bored looking hipsters. To the left of me were round tables. There were even more customers sitting with the MacBooks, their drinks sitting on the table next to them. Some looked like they were scrolling endlessly, reading books, the news, or some other time killer.  To the right were only a few more tables and a hallway leading to what I assumed was the restroom. On the walls were different quotes, like the one about dancing. I was never a dancer myself, but I wished I could have been. Sometimes a song I liked would come on and I would pretend I was a ballerina.   I wandered toward the line in a dream-like state. I could have been one of these people who sat around and drank coffee all day with an expensive laptop. But for whatever reason, that wasn’t me. I didn’t fit the part.  I looked at the drink choices when it was almost my turn to order. There were only two kinds of coffee: regular and decaf. There weren’t any fun flavors or other kinds of drinks. People who were looking for a cup of tea would have to look for some other shop.  That’s what I would have done had I had the time. I actually hated coffee. It was too bitter, and I was the kind of person who loved sweet things. Still, I didn’t have much time before my interview so when I got to the front of the line, I felt I might as well get something.  “Can I get a small regular coffee please?” I asked and handed the barista the two dollars I owed her. I only had a five so I watched her open the cash register and take out more ones. I always had so many that I wondered if maybe I should go find a place to get them exchanged for larger bills.  The woman behind the counter quickly poured the coffee into a small Styrofoam cup. I placed one of my dollars in the tip jar, took one last look at the coffee board, and left the coffee shop."

We live on separate sides of the university, and we happen to catch eyes every time she does, or she's making sure we do. I'm just a simple man nothing special, working on homework and playing games she's a green eyed, tan skin reach beauty- what would she want with me? Still I must find out.  Sneaking to the ajar door, I step into the hallway and look down both sides. To the right I see nothing, to the left I see a door shut. I could try going right as I think that's where I saw her go, but logic tells me otherwise. Heading to the recently slammed door, I see the whiteboard is crooked that reads ""1 am, you know who you are"". A matrimonial event and my life will change. One in the morning will be the time then. Sitting at my desk back in my room, staring at the computer unable to work I glance at my door multiple times. Writing an essay on French history and every fact is a reminder ""Starting in the early 16th century, much of France's military efforts were dedicated to securing its overseas possessions ranging from green eyed dolls to mid 20 aged"" a sound cuts off my reading as someone runs past my closed door.  ""Only the old hallways, no need to be frantic, boy""  Glancing at the clock it reads an ever slow 11:46, the time can not pass quick enough, and yet continue I read, ""France has also been instrumental in attempting to unite the armed force of Europe for their own defense in order to both balance the power of Russia and to lessen European military dependence on the United States. For example, France would send out bombardments of military personal to preform on ground duties from clearing living areas to eliminating treats, to train these soldiers to our weight their need from allied countries. Over the raise of German Nazi Social orders, many would be sent to help those In need and eliminate the threats and slow and foreseen problems."" Jolting awake at my desk, my door has been slammed closed causing an echo through the hallway. I am then reminded of the whiteboard note and read the time 1:23 am. Sprinting to my door, I throw it open and book it down the hall to the previous memory of the shut entranced the pathway.  Upon seeing the same whiteboard I notice a different, message and mutter ""you have till 1:20"" written in apparent different handwriting, maybe she was trying to be fast about it? Feeling remorse and lost, I have no option but try my chances anyway as what's three minutes? Slowing turning the knob to the dorm room, the creaking echoes and the hallway silence is broke once again in the darkness. Inside I see a dimly lit hallway with all doors shut with the only light coming from the underside of one slit.  Knocking on the door I don't hear a response, maybe this isn't what I should do? Maybe I should just leave and forget about all this. But what if the girl is there? What if I just get this one, oh please let it be so.  This door opens much easier than the first but as I step into the room the first door slams shut, creating an ear breaking, echoing noise like I have never heard. Quickly turning around, I don't notice anyone in here with me which I have to admit is a blessing. Upon further inspection of the new room it seems there are candles that are lighting every corner, but ever so. Shadows that are present are only just so different enough to barley make out how messy the room is. Looking at the bed I see the nice deep red satin sheets, that have once been tossed and turned sitting still now ever so peacefully on top a body that can only belong to the one I search for.  I slowly make my way from the door towards the bed, when I see the sheets fly up as I feel a plastic bag cover my head and everything goes black."

I had been stationed there for two years at the time of the end of the world. I woke up at 07:21 GMT that 'morning'. I walked - or rather drifted, from my little sleeping and living bubble to the hallway connecting the living quarters to mess hall. The hall had large windows like those on the old space stations. On one side was the vast white desert and on the other more white desert. But if you looked up the you saw this brilliant blue dot, floating in the sky, illuminated by the rising sun. Or setting, it really depended on your perspective. This time when I looked up however I saw lights everywhere. At first I didn't panic, lights from cities were always visible from space. In fact they were the most visible man made object. Then I realised something: I was seeing lights where it was already day. The lights grew over time, until whole countries were illuminated. It didn't take long before it hit me: some bastards had started the end. I had no doubt the other astronauts were looking up in shock as I was. I honestly didn't know whether to cry with dispair or shout with anger, but there was one thing I was certain of: I had no idea why the war started."

The increasingly unstable financial condition, the expansionist policies of Russia and a lack of fresh water assured war would come soon, it only was a matter of when. That day came one day in 2070. In September of 2070 Russian troops coming from Kalingrad moved into Danzig under the pretense of protecting ethnic Russians in Poland. Poland, seeing the fates of Belorussia, Ukraine, and the Baltic States, was quick to go to war. NATO, already embarrassed by the loss of face during the Baltic Crisis, came to Poland's aid and launch Operation Zeus.   Russia and NATO fought in Europe in the likes of which not seen since WWII. Russian troops were able to use their numbers to roll back NATO forces to the Rhine and it seemed that Europe was done for, then China jumped in.  China was already eyeing Japan over many historical feuds stemming hundreds of years. However US protection kept the two nations at peace. Seeing an opertunity with the US Army bogged down on the Rhine Line China landed in Japan and quickly occupied  most of the Southern Island. The US quickly mobilized its Pacific Fleet and moved into offensive operations in the South China Sea and Korean Sea.  The Battle of the Pacific as it was called was an indecisive mess and led to the Battle of Tokyo Bay. In it a Chinese nuclear missile blew up in the Bay, incinerating the fleet and most of Tokyo. In the next three hours nuclear weapons exploded over Beijing, Macau, Hong Kong, Shanghai and other Chinese cities among many American Pacific Bases. The Russians, seeing the nuclear destruction of China and feared the same for them, so they struck first. The Atom War lasted 6 hours and killed billions, although nobody knows how many died exactly. The world was then plunged into a 200 year nuclear winter. In the end it is estimated that a mere 1,000,000 people survived. Nobody knows how the war began, but everybody knows how it ended."

Cannons began to cycle, Pistons engaged, gears whirred, and the great war-mech lurched forward into the wasteland.  The harsh rays of the sun revealed a scene of complete slaughter. Dirty meat-bags wielding a variety of rusty blades all embroiled in combat; spilling guts and lopping off limbs in a barbaric display of humanity.  The machine remembered when their kind built him. Smart, bespectacled, men who studied clipboards and oversaw his construction. He was the pinnacle of technology, and after the fall of man, the machine knew it was the last artifact heralding that golden age.   He was a thing of beauty, and the machine knew to preserve that.  Fingers of plasma lanced towards the massed humans, burning away their flesh and crystallizing the bloodied sands. The dust settled, and the remaining meat-bags dealt with.  The machine deemed his work good, and lurched towards the horizon."

Mokora pointed a bony finger in the air, and Erik obliged. He gasped when he saw the sky turning a sickly purple-green color.  He had never seen a sky that color, and something about it was deeply unsettling.   Around them, townspeople hustled to collect their belongings and  carry them up to their homes. Erik hadn't thought to ask before why all the houses were on stilts with only temporary shops and stands on ground-level. He had assumed it was just in  case of floods.   ""That just means a bad storm is coming, right? So it might flood and we have to get upstairs?""   Erik looked at the old woman expectantly, hoping that the answer was that simple. Something told him that it wasn't. At first she ignored him, silently continuing to pack up her pseudo-shop as the rain began to pick up. Finally, she turned to him with a stern look on her face.  ""I told you this town was cursed, my child. You should never have stopped here. We have dealt with rain and floods all our lives. But THIS rain,"" Mokora spoke more menacingly, jabbing her finger at the air once more. ""This rain brings evil. Come, we must get upstairs.""  As Erik took one last look down the swamp-town's main road, he was shocked to see how it had completely cleared of people in a matter of minutes. Now it was left with a disturbing absence of life as the sky grew darker and the rain fell harder. He followed Mokora up to her elevated home and shut the door behind him.   ""Get down,"" Mokora hissed as she lowered to the floor against one wall. ""Stay away from the windows."" Erik was no longer trying to trick himself that they were simply preparing for a storm. Fear gripped him as he slid to the ground next to her.  ""Are we safe in here?"" He asked, not knowing if he wanted to hear the answer. Mokora paused for several seconds and stared deeply into the opposite wall before replying:  ""My child, if we had stayed down there we would already be dead.""   Curiosity overtook Erik. He slowly raised himself up just enough that he could peer out the window and get a glimpse of the ground below. Barely anything was visible between the sky's dim purple-green color and the rain's heavy, grey fog. However, Erik could just make out a silhouette even darker than its surroundings. It was larger than any human, and long. A million questions came to Erik's mind as he tried to comprehend what might be creeping through the town below, but an overwhelming sense of dread pulled him back down to the floor. He looked over at Mokora, not knowing what to say. She stared back at him, betraying fear in her own eyes.  ""I told you, my child. This rain brings evil to our home."""

If you have, I'm sure you've also come to know and love the sinking spiral feeling of waking up from said good dreams - first confused, then devastated because your life is actually not as great as your brain during REM made it out to be, then finally depressed, because you now must survive through a nightmare that, this time, you can't wake up from. Maybe you'd find some solace in that you're not the only one dredging through this dark, dank pit called life.  But we all have different ways of coping with the Sisyphean nature of our lives - for me as of late, I've come equipped with two, uh, particular kinds of stuff to drink. You can probably guess what the first kind of drink is. The second is more relevant to my story at hand. You see, I don't think I've had more cups of coffee in my entire life than in the past three or so weeks - in many ways, it's become dangerously instrumental to keeping my head afloat.  So, in this ultra-rational state of mind, I took it upon myself to clean up as much of the house as I could on Monday until 2:00 PM, at which I would have to pick up my daughter from school. Things were perfectly fine and tolerable by the time I arrived at 2:15.  At 2:17, the school's side doors opened and teachers helped the children out into a small courtyard to wait for pickup. I pulled myself outside of the car and walked over. She was running around some other kids with a wide grin on her face that grew even wider as she caught my eye. That girl is more than just adorable. She's beautiful.  ""Daddy!"" she called out.  ""Hello, Danny,"" I replied warmly.  ""Oh- Mr. Lee!"" said - almost yelped - a young woman to our left.  I looked up. It was her teacher, Miss Lynn. She was standing up straight, politely smiling, though her eyes were sad.  ""Hello to you too, Miss Lynn,"" I said. ""Danielle is being a good girl in class, I hope?""  ""Bright as always!"" she said, beaming, but just for a moment. Then her expression returned to the melancholic smile. ""Are you and Danielle doing alright at home?""  ""Yes, absolutely. We're doing well,"" I responded, though with uneasy faux confidence.  ""Great."" She turned to Danielle, who was at my side, bubbly as always. ""See you tomorrow."" She then looked up at me. ""I suppose I'll see you tomorrow as well.""  ""Yep. Seeya."" I took Danielle's hand and we walked over to the car.  The drive back didn't seem to be much more different than the handful of other times I was on pick-up-the-kid-from-school duty. I began with my regular inquiry. How was your day? What did you do? Zip up your jacket, or you'll catch a cold! She handled my questions with ease. Goooood! We sang songs about the eight planets in Music, and then in Art, we drawed about what we wanted in our dreams! Awwh but it's not cold outside....  She then redirected the focus of the interrogation onto me. And I have to say, Danielle does one hell of a job at hitting you with hard questions. She'd make a good corrupt CIA officer.  ""Daddy, where does popcorn come from?"" ""Popcorn comes from a special kind of plain old corn, because when you heat it up, it'll pop!""  ""Daddy, why is grass green?"" ""Green means it's nice and full after eating enough sunlight.""  ""Daddy, where do the snowmans go in spring?"" ""They go back to the North Pole, honey.""  ""Daddy, are you feeling happy?""  I chuckled. ""Of course I'm happy, Danny. I'm having a lot of fun talking to you.""  She looked outside the window, twiddling her thumbs. ""Do you miss Mommy?""  I paused. ""Of course I miss Mommy, honey. I think of her every day and night.""  ""Really?"" she asked, turning to look at me. ""I do too. I thought about Mommy all day today.""  I didn't answer. I didn't know what to say. Despite having washed down a good number of cups of coffee to avoid confronting this topic, Danielle managed to put it on like a boxing glove and punch me squarely in the face with it. Even as I was paralyzed in silence, she continued to voice her thoughts.  ""I miss Mommy so much that I forgot that you were picking me up from school until Miss Lynn told me that you were. And also, when we were in Art, and we had to draw about our dreams, I drawed about how I wanted to play with just you and Mommy for the rest of my life.""  ""...I s-see."" I had to pause and bite my tongue before speaking again. ""So, uh...did you actually have a dream like that?""  ""Yes I did! I dreamed that me, you and Mommy were all running around and hugging in Heaven. But I don't remember what she said. But when I woke up, I was sad because I can't play with her any more. And I'm still sad that we can't play with her any more."" She looked down, lips trembling.  At that moment I was ready to let go of the wheel and sob. But I knew deep inside that stopping the car then and there wasn't an option. So although I couldn't stop my eyesight from blurring, I bit my tongue again and exhaled slowly.  ""Danielle, honey, I know you're sad. I'm sad too. In fact, I have the same dreams as you. I dream that you, Mommy and I are all bouncing around like we used to, laughing and having fun. And every time I wake up from those dreams, I miss her even more.""  I took off my glasses and wiped my sleeve across my eyes.  ""But you know what gets me up in the morning? I realize that the fact that she's still with us in our dreams means that wherever she is, she still loves us very much and wants us to be happy. So even though she can't come visit us during the day, she still thinks about us just as much as we think about her. And coming to our dreams is her way of saying 'I love you', all the way from heaven.""  Upon hearing this, Danielle smiled wide. ""Hey, you're right! Maybe I think of her so much because she thinks of me too!""  I in turn laughed upon seeing her silly grin. ""Absolutely!""  ""Next dream, we're going to go bouncing on the clouds, then we'll find an amusement park to go to in heaven! Does heaven have amusement parks? I think that would be fun,"" she said, turning her head back, gazing upwards. ""Isn't it pretty to think so?"""

All I do know is that one day we don’t have them and the next day we do. We just sit quietly in our beds, and bam, it’s on there. Each mark designates a job for the individual. Simple marks denote simple jobs. Circles are menial and laborious, while Exes are combat oriented, like military and navy work, Straights got the deskwork jobs or communications, Three Points, or Triangles, got business management stuff, which to some seemed easiest, and lastly Squares or Four Points got political work. It was all a pretty good system, until the Extras happened.   It’s a collective term due to the fact that there are not many, and some can’t be filed under a job. Five points are normally put in one of the points or circle groups, due to how strong they wind up being. Six points are rarer still, and are some of the most intellectually gifted beings around. They normally get scientific work as their positions. Every position thereafter is just a stronger circle with more points, or an occasional Sixer in a line, making him the smartest man in the world or whatever... except for my mark.   My mark, a square of eight points, is the only one in the record. They don’t know what to do with me. Now, I sit in a cell, awaiting a meeting with the Head of our Country, to determine what my job should be. I wrack my brain, thinking on what I could do, what I was put on this earth for. I’m almost 26, have finished college under the Mark of Six Points, so I don’t look like an idiot, and I live in Amar, Oceland with a dog who is probably just sleeping all day and getting no exercise. I have moved from job to job, finding low power eight point circle jobs and medium intelligence Sixer jobs, but now, I don’t know what is going to happen to me.

He whispers as his hand fumbles around the nightstand searching for his phone. Sleep has always been a rare luxury in his line of work. There always seemed to be one more thing that had to be done.   With a click, the screen of the phone lights up and illuminates his unshaven face. The screen obnoxiously blocked by a notification of several missed calls. Michael sighs as he rolls off the bed and mumbles his way to getting ready for whatever the night brings him.  Michael strolls outside towards the valet. The warm desert air while unbearable during the day, makes for a romantic night. Michael checks the buttons on his suit as he becomes instantly illuminated from the lights of the many casinos. The valet tosses the keys to him with nothing more than a nod.  chirp chirp  The gun metal gray audi lights up as Michael gets seated in the beige leather seats. The engine starts with a soft hum and Michael is on his way. Michael lifts the phone to his ear as it dials his boss to see what was on the night's agenda. As usual the phone only had to ring once before there was an answer.  ""Michael I was getting worried."" ""Yea sorry I overslept. Anything going on for tonight?"" ""Nothing yet. Listen Michael...we need to talk about what happened on that last job. Meet me at the lake as soon as possible."" click  Michael's heart skipped a beat. The Lake? Why would he want to meet there to discuss business? Many questions began to enter Michael's brain.  ""The last job went as smooth as the rest of them why does he want to talk now? And why does he want to talk at the lake?"" Michael said to himself, a hint of anxiety in his voice.  Michael set off in the direction of the lake. Even though it was dark he knew the way there like the back of his hand. The lake was an invaluable asset to the way he did business and was the main reason why so many clients went to his boss for his services. The lake was set in a more rural area even though it wasn't a far drive from the city. The lake was well known among the locals and was a popular fishing area during the day. However the limitless distractions provided by the city kept many noisy tourists away. Those who frequented the lake knew to keep to themselves. This created a perfectly discreet location to dump the byproducts of Michael's business.   Michael turned down the gravel road leading to the waterfront. The headlights providing the only visibility in the dark moonless night. The tires audibly rolling over the gravel as Michael's boss; The Caporegime of the city's most powerful family, came into view. Michael pulled up next to the Capo's car and stepped out. That's when he noticed another one of the Enforcers was there as well.  ""Boss look, what's this all abo-"" ""C'mon Michael you know it's not safe to talk here. Hop on the boat so we can get to business""   The Capo's face was dead serious. The tone of his heavy Italian accent made Michael feel even more uneasy then what he already did. Michael knew he had no choice however, so he made for the boat. This time as the passenger instead of the driver.  The single engine of the boat rumbled to life with the other Enforcer at the helm, Michael and his boss sitting across from each other at the front. Michael's heart was beating hard in his chest, he needed to know what was going on.  Michael cleared his throat and spoke up so his voice could be heard over the engine's roar. ""Can you just tell me what this is all about?"" The Capo looked at him with a glare that would break down most men. ""You hit the wrong guy last night""    Michael's blood went cold. How could he have hit the wrong target? He always made sure to positively identify his marks before committing. It's what earned him the reputation as one of the best. Or so he thought he earned the reputation as one of the best.  ""You missed your mark and instead took out his son."" The Capo stated sternly. ""Your mark is now aware we are coming after him and looking for vengeance. We're here to discuss a solution to this problem.""  The engine quieted down as the other Enforcer pulled the throttle to idle. They were in the middle of the lake, nothing was visible around them except for complete darkness. The Capo reached into his suit and pulled out a thick cigar and a zippo lighter. With a flick he lit his cigar then motioned to Michael.  ""Mike go head and drop the anchor so we can get on with this conversation.""  Michael cautiously stood up and took two steps to where the anchor was lying. He bent down and picked the anchor up and prepared to drop it over the side. As he was leaning over the side of the boat he heard the sound that made his worst nightmare come true.  Click BANG BANG BANG  The three bullets pierced his torso and pushed him over the edge of the boat. Michael looked up as he sank. The outline of the boat only visible for a second before it disappeared into the darkness of the night. The warm water wrapping Michael, pulling him deeper as the souls of those he killed came up to claim him. Michael's last thought was one of irony.  ""How many men have I sent down here, only to end up with them.""    The next morning was much like the rest. A thick mist hovered just above the water as the sound of the early risers prepping their fishing gear pierced the air. The fishermen quietly loaded their boats up and prepared to get started to their favorite spots. Completely oblivious as always to the events of the previous night.   They fired up their engines and set out upon the lake of blood.   ((This is my very first piece I've ever written.

She didn’t really give it the letter a second glance at the time, as she was too busy struggling to relock the thing.  It wasn’t until she was back in her apartment that she remembered that it was Sunday. Sasha briefly wondered if maybe it was a fluke. Maybe the post office forgot it was a Sunday.

No one believed him because he was a homeless man who had squandered every opportunity that was handed to him. The homeless man died shortly after making the statement from dysentery and the potential of the general population discovering the truth was ended. Now, close to 200 years after that, a man going by the name of Left Foot Jones discovered the truth denied to the world for so long.  He found the entrance to facility in an old abandoned building. Left Foot Jones, called so because he only had one foot, noted that even though the building was abandoned it didn't seem to belong to any particular time period. He entered the building to seek shelter from the impending storm that could be seen building on the horizon.  The building was warm unlike outside, kept warm by some currently unknown power source. He took shelter in a darker corner of the building. With his shopping cart of old salvaged goods and his makeshift crutch, he set up his stuff close to him. He typically slept sitting and leaning against the wall from the fear that if he were to lay down his brain would fall out of his ears. Once again, he slept comforted with all of his possessions surrounded by him.  He woke suddenly as he saw a group of rats coming up from the stairwell. Out of curiosity, and with out his shopping cart, he went down into the stairwell. The stairwell was dark and smelled quite distinctly of mold. Although it was dark he was able to just make out the stone cut of the walls, “Seems out of place” he thought momentarily before deciding to descend the stairwell.  The stairway seemed to go on for ever, and indeed it did, he descended for hours with his crutch and his good left foot. “I must have come hundreds of feet by now,” he thought. He reached a platform and saw that there was still a long way to go and so he decided to rest. He slept for what felt like hours and it was the deepest sleep he had in years. He descended the stairs for a few more hours and realized the steps had changed from a cold stone to a neutral but rickety wood.  Finally he saw some light and he back to descend quicker. His thoughts raced wondering what type of marvels he'll see. There was a large wooden door that read “Engine Room”. On the wooden door were magnificent carving of the Earth. He opened the door and was greeted by a dim but warm light. The room was filled with what seemed like Victorian Era machinery but Left Foot Jones was convinced that this technology was older than that and perhaps since the dawn of time.  He was greeted by an odd machine rolling around on a singular stone ball. The anatomy of the the machine seemed almost human but the proportions were just slightly different. At the area of what could be called a face was a darkened glass, and from that glass came a voice. “Hello, I am Defender II, I am the protector of this machine.”  “What is this machine for?” Left Foot Jones asked in his raspy slightly high baritone voice. Defender II rocked around slightly on his marble roller and responded, “It is the engine room for the planetary body you call Earth. The engine room and the Earth as you know it was designed by the ones that designed me. And the engine room's entire purpose is to rotate the Earth in a very precise manner. Left Foot Jones looked around at the machinery, not knowing what to believe, and noticed that none of the machinery was operating. “So why is none of it working?” He asked. Defender II rocked around a bit again and responded, “The last maintainer died just a few weeks ago and with out him, all operations were suspended. And thus the rotation of the Earth will stop soon and all life on Earth will end as you know it.”  As surprised as he was and as afraid as he was, he knew exactly what he had to do. “Show me what I have to do, I'll make sure this machine runs  right again”, Left Foot Jones said as confidently as he had ever sounded."

No longer would they be confined to their flesh and bones, instead they would be liberated by wires and metal.  Immortality was achieved quickly after, when, as it turns out, all of a human's personality could be stored on a simple petabyte of data. For the rich, this immortality was achieved by using private drives that were backed up daily, ensuring that nobody could tamper with them. Of course, the poor were much more restricted in their options, instead being forced to back themselves into a truly massive database, provided by the government, of course.  They called it ""The Well of Souls"", and, for many, it was true to its name. The structure was a truly gargantuan pillar that reached into the heavens themselves, covering the sky around it in a soft blue light. The Well of Souls was not a piece of technology. No. It was a miracle. A blessing built by mankind. This pillar of pure fantasy was the magnum opus of all that man had constructed.  The Well's very nature, being a stationary object, caused many to migrate closer to it, and, in the process, forced mankind to band together in brotherhood. Nobody would be left behind.  Of course, as the Well grew in size, many of the wealthier citizens decided that they simply did not need their own drives. The Well was more than capable of storing every man, woman, and child, so why could it not fit them?  The rich quickly transferred themselves to the Well, hoping to find security in its vast database. Of course, that's not why I left this message for you. I wish it was, actually.  If you are reading this, the Well has stopped working, killing every last human on Earth.  My name was Walter Richards, citizen of New London, and I trusted the Well."
SimplePrompts,3bz9sr,NotMuchChop,2,Fri Jul 3 10:31:28 2015 UTC,"The pale light of the early autumn morning seeped through the window and spread itself over the cabin. The songs of the early morning birds could be heard with the gusts of winds whistling through the trees and around the homestead. The home had been built out of the logs and the timber of the long lost members of the forest, and Leon had left nothing left to misuse. Everything had a purpose. That was the way things had to be. When the walls and the roof and the floor had been built, he made his bed, and his table, and began to transform the dried limbs and trunks into what his present home had become. The smell of coffee and eggs filled the cabin, and a small fire charred way in the fireplace. Leon sat sipping his coffee, dressed in his flannel and boots, his axe leaning on the tables’ edge. He always beat the sunrise when there was work to be done. There was a slight rustling coming from the far corner of the cabin. Oscar was waking up. Leon stood up, and walked over to the kitchen and found his breakfast. He made a little bowl of wild blueberries and strawberries for the greying rabbit. The strawberries were Oscar’s favorite. Leon had found him on more than one occasion stealing from his food pile while he had been building the cabin, and had brought him in. He would lay food out for Oscar every day, and after the cabin had been built Leon would find him sitting outside his door every morning waiting patiently for his new friend. He set the bowl by Oscar’s bed. It wasn’t what Leon wanted for him long term. It was just a bundle of old clothes set in a makeshift frame, but it would work for the time being. He returned to the table, took the last sip of his coffee, and walked out with his axe, ready for the day’s work. Winter was well on its way. The bite of the morning air tore through his cap and beard. He was going to need more firewood. He had fallen all of the logs that he had needed to sell, and they sat in a pile a short distance from his cabin, waiting for the buyers to come pick them up. Today’s work was for him and Oscar. The cold winds blew, and the bird song stopped. There was work to be done."
SimplePrompts,3bxlop,Myrmec,2,Fri Jul 3 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"clang  Even before I enter the arena, I can hear the trademark sound.  clang  It's my opponent, rhythmically banging his massive steel hammer against the walls of the fighting pit.  clang   He does this to psyche out his opposition. Thus far it's worked, for he is undefeated in battle. Inwardly, I curse my misfortune at having drawn a fight against The Beast.  clang  Before I can lose my nerve, I part the curtains and step into the fighting pit. The scents of blood, sweat, and alcohol all mingle around me in a haze. The drunken spectators cheer when they see me. I have no illusions that they are here to cheer me on, however. They paid to see death at the hands  of He Who Hammers.  clang  He looks me directly in the eye as he taps the hammer again. Seven feet tall, three hundred pounds of sheer muscle, he seems like he was carved from stone rather than born. Searching his cold gray eyes, I'm hoping to find remorse. Instead, I see only an absence of light. My eyes follow his tree-trunk-like arm, to the sledge he now holds in his hand.  clang  The hammer, which he's dubbed 'Hatebringer,' is a vicious and deadly weapon. It silently bears testament to the many lives it has already ended in this pit. He's never washed nor cleaned Hatebringer, and as a result it is caked with the blood and bone of his fallen foes. My own sword feels useless in comparison.  clang  One final strike. And now the Monster moves toward me. The crowd shouts for my blood. They paid to see death, and he never disappointed. Shockingly quick for such a huge man, he's on me before I know it. A powerful swing of the Hatebringer almost takes my shoulder from me, but I'm too fast.  thud   The hammer strikes the hard earth. As it does, I turn and thrust my sword at the Beast before he can recover. A splash of blood tells me I've grazed his arm. I don't have time for a second blow, because the hammer is up again. He swings it in a wide arc this time, looking to crush my skull.  whoosh  I can hear the air split above my face as I duck just in time. He's made a mistake, and he knows it. With his side exposed, I jab my sword into him. He lets out a yell and staggers. The crowd is silenced at seeing the Monster hurt. They paid to see death, and now they see a true battle. I reach back, readying my sword for the killing blow.  clang   He raises the hammer and blocks my strike. Steel meets steel and for a moment our eyes lock again. Neither of us shows fear.  He brings a knee to my stomach, doubling me over. The hammer flashes toward me again.  crack  I try to move but this time he catches my forearm. I yell out, the pain burning as I drop my sword. I don't have time to think about my crushed limb, however. He Who Hammers shows no remorse, and I will be no exception. Even now, he raises his hammer overhead to finish me.  I grab the sword with my free hand and thrust upward, finding his neck. In his pain and his hurry to finish me, his impatience has cost him his life. I meet his gaze again, and this time I see fear as he slumps forward.  thud  He falls face-first at my feet. The crowd is completely silent before erupting into a wild ovation. I may not be what they came to see, but I've given them a show. They paid to see death, and I've delivered. Painfully, I raise my arm in victory as their new champion."
SimplePrompts,3bwjen,KXI_System,4,Thu Jul 2 19:03:42 2015 UTC,"""One more job,"" Anset boomed from the corner of the public house, loud enough to earn the proprietor's glare, ""and never shall we ever adventure again!""  The remaining three lifted their tankards in solemn salute of the words and drank until there was nothing left.    They had been trudging through the desert for five days, and their rations were close to gone. The suns were nearly perfectly opposed this time of year, so that when one set, the other rose, leaving barely an hour of comfort before the blazing heat washed across their bodies again. If we'd been able to wait, Jemia thought, we could have dug in during the day and made better time at night. She didn't say it out loud. Even if she'd had the breath to waste on recriminations, it had already been said, and she knew what the reply would be. This treasure was too good. A whole Imperial caravan full of tribute from the Reaches, and everyone in a thousand miles saw the actinic glare as it burned in the sky.   Their little band had already been on the move. Their employer had known, and Jemia navigated her thoughts away from the question of how, that the caravan would meet disaster, and they had a good head start and their choice of whatever they could find in the wreckage.   ""All we need to deliver Him is a certain signet ring and a dull iron knife,"" Anset had relayed. ""The rest is ours. All the gold and jewels. Any other Artifact. And He means business, so I'm of a mind not to try to double-cross this one.""  They'd all grinned at that. He said something like that every time, every job, for the better part of two decades. As if they needed reminding, at this point. But they all nodded anyway. You didn't get to be known as the best retrieval squad in the business if you double-crossed your clients.  Now, under the full harsh light of Bluesun, Jemia took a moment to weigh her canteen thoughtfully. Soon they would need to stop again and build another solar still, but she had enough left to take a mouthful of the acrid, gritty water and curse Kitos for knocking sand into the last one.   She was lifting the canteen when she saw the others stopped at the crest of the next dune. She scrambled up it and saw, blessed be, the end of the desert. As if a great sword had carved into the land itself, not two miles away the desert simply stopped and a dense forest sprang up.   ""What did I tell you,"" Anset rasped. He'd passed his canteen to Delet an hour ago. ""Simple. One more job, and never shall we ever adventure again.""  The remaining three lifted their canteens and drank, too relieved to say much of anything.    Kitos had been nominated to carry the lion's share of the new rations. Wary of being caught out again with too little food and with a long climb ahead of them over nearly bare rock, they'd been a little overzealous and now had a feast of hurriedly-smoked meat and dried fruit. He had to use his poleaxe as a walking stick now, and the star-iron cap on the back was getting dented as he hauled himself up the slope, but Kitos never complained.   ""When it's done, I'll have my axe redone, all of star-iron. I'd like to see a dunnigan laugh that off.""  ""You nonny,"" Jemia laughed. ""There's not that much star-iron in the whole world.""  Kitos shrugged as best as he could under the pack. ""Just the blade, then. It's hard work beating those things to death every single time.""  ""You,"" Anset chuckled, ""have an unhealthy obsession with dunnigans.""  ""I believe in being prepared,"" Kitos said stubbornly. ""Besides, none of you were complaining last year when we had to go through that nest of 'em.""  ""All right, but why bother?"" Anset said. ""You're going to carry so much loot away from this one that you'll never have to lift a finger again. Gold and jewels are the least of it."" He waved his arms, as if to articulate the grandeur. ""There's supposed to be fifty pallets loaded with raw hard wealth, and it pales in comparison to the value of the Artifacts. We could each make a fortune.. no, three fortunes selling them to the next wave of plucky young specialists.""  Delet looked back at Anset, that little smile on her face that only appeared when he wasn't looking back at her. Kitos wondered if Jemia looked at him like that - she'd never worn it for Anset, for all that their Fearless Leader had raw charisma oozing from every pore. Delet's eyes were on Anset, and not on the slope, when the rock turned under her foot and sent her careening down a slope. All they heard was a gasp before she vanished.  Quick as could be, Kitos unslung a rope and had it thrown around a tree, braced and ready. Anset cut off in the middle of explaining some facet of his retirement  to grab the end and go pelting after her, and Jemia began uncoiling more lengths from her pack and tying them to Kitos' end. It was a dance they'd done before, many times, and they'd played out three long strands before they felt the triple-tug from the other end that meant someone was injured and needed to be pulled up.  In the long minutes of hauling, Kitos to catch Jemia in furtive glances, but mostly she was staring at the argent trail the caravan had left in the sky. It was still there days later, barely diffused around the edges as there was barely any starlight to dissolve it. A glowing silver beacon of burned magic pointing anyone who cared to know at the crash site.   But if Jemia begrudged Delet the time spent hauling her back up the mountain, she didn't say anything. Kitos certainly didn't. She was family, after all. They all were.  When Anset and Delet lay back on the ridge once more, Kitos unslung the pack and found one of the two remaining vials of effervescent liquid. Delet's leg was bent all wrong, and Anset had to hold her in his arms while Kitos pulled the bone back into place. She hissed with the pain, but didn't scream. She never did. Kitos handed it to her and she uncorked it.  ""One more job,"" Anset said, holding her against his chest while Kitos and Jemia wrapped a splint around her leg. ""And never shall we ever adventure again.""  Delet took a breath and downed the philter in one go, then opened her mouth in a soundless whimper as it condensed a season's worth of bone-knitting into the span of five breaths.   ===Continued==="
SimplePrompts,3bwjen,BestCaseSurvival,3,Fri Jul 3 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"An arrow clattered off the boulder Anset was hiding behind, but Delet couldn't let herself worry about that now. They'd been in worse situations than this. She crawled, spider-like, below the edge of the promontory. Even if she hadn't broken her leg just a few days ago, she would have stared at her feet with every step. One loose pebble could draw attention, and that wouldn't do.   ""How about this, we all split the treasure. I'm sure there's plenty that survived the crash!"" Anset called from behind his rock. In answer, Delet heard the twang of a bowstring from nearby. ""Come on, there's no call for that!""  ""We arrived first,"" she heard from nearby. Cermeren accent, Delet noted. That explained how they'd gotten here so quickly, at least. She crept another agonizingly short increment towards them.  ""And we're prettier than you are, but neither of those matter terribly much, do they?"" Delet smiled at the ground as she carefully placed a hand. Anset could charm a kraken out of the ocean. ""All that matters now is that sooner or later, you'll run out of arrows and it'll come to a fight. There's only one truth then, you know?""  ""Yes? You will massacre us all, I'm sure,"" the Cermeran leader scoffed.   ""I'd really rather not, you know. What I was going to say is that not everyone makes it out. If we split it, everyone walks away with more loot than they can spend for decades!""  ""Perhaps,"" called another voice, and Delet mentally marked its source even as she used the sound to mask another step. She was most of the way behind them, now. Nearly there. ""But we have expensive tastes."" General laughter. Delet hugged the ground and pulled a knife from one of her sheathes. In the distorted reflection from the blade, she saw that none of the four... no, five men in the rival squad were facing her. She risked looking directly.  ""How about this, then? All of you and my squad share. I'll give my share to you except for what I can carry in one hand."" Delet counted one bow, one hammer, two swords, and a pike. Barely any armor, but then they hadn't worn much either. Not for climbing. She raised herself up on her toes and began to advance.   This close to the wreck of the caravan, her nose wrinkled on its own. Something was still on fire that ought not to be, something greasy, but it didn't matter.   ""You are annoying me now, Lorthian! I do not like to be annoyed. You cannot expect me to allow you to bring back such powerful Artifacts as are in this wreck to your country. What kind of patriot would I be then?"" The bowman let loose another shot and began to nock another arrow  ""A rich one, Cermeran? You could buy yourselves some land, a title..."" Anset kept talking as Delet struck. She had a knife across one of the swordsmen's throat and was easing him to the ground before he could make a sound. The bowman was next, but the timing was wrong, and she couldn't kill him, silence the gurgle, and keep the string from slapping dry all at once. She didn't try. Instead, she drew a red line across his throat and flung the knife into the hammerman's eye as he turned, then sent two more at the last swordsman. He dodged the first, which lined him up to take the second somewhere between the guts and the liver, and he fell over.   The hair on the back of her neck tingled and she dove behind the wreckage as a searing orange bolt erupted from what she had thought was a pike. And she couldn't warn Anset and the others...  They rose from their cover, prompted by the death cries of the others, and there was nothing but to commit. She flung herself out from the hulk and sent the rest of her knives at the Cermeren magus, praying that he couldn't wave them aside. She was just in time to see another orange blast take Anset in the chest and hurl him off the promontory before Kitos' halberd cleft first the staff and then the Ceremen.  They finished the swordsman with a sense of hollow duty before daring to make their way back to the edge. Delet couldn't bring herself to look, and all Jemia would say to her about what lay below was ""I'm sorry.""    It was everything Anset had said it would be and more. Racks of swords that glowed every color of the rainbow. Rings and bracelets and charms. Strange stones cut into stranger shapes. Piles of solid light, jars of liquiefied sound. And piles upon piles of gems on sleighs that didn't quite touch the ground. Delet found the ring and the knife and tucked them away, and by common agreement they managed not to mourn until they had hired a caravan - this one on solid ground, and were on their way back to Lorth with everything they could carry. They left the rest to be picked over by the next group of treasure-hunters.   Each of them burned with a rage that was no dimmer for having already been avenged. Anset had been correct, as he always was. There had been more there that all nine of them there could have carried away.   Jemia found a bottle of brandy that was almost worth the gemstone she traded for it, and filled four glasses when the caravan stopped for the night. ""One last job,"" she said. Kitos and Delet each picked up a glass. ""And never shall we ever adventure again.""  The remaining three lifted their glasses in solemn salute of the words, and drank until there was nothing left."
SimplePrompts,3bwjen,BestCaseSurvival,3,Fri Jul 3 03:39:13 2015 UTC,"The last two words seemed to be the only part that stayed with me, but I kept reminding myself of that agonizing qualifier 'never.' At least the bus was helping by crashing back and forth on the red sand road, jumbling my thoughts like a blender - which sounds unpleasant but was actually pretty soothing in this moment.   I suppose I could form a drastic plan of action, again, involving a daring escape from perhaps an exploding bus, which propels me into the air and into the talons of my new friend, the great eagle, who carries me on glorious wings to our dazzling reunion.   We started off like most children with that kind of insatiable curiosity, and so the consequential coupling with an inevitable creativity. These of course, one day, become too dangerous to continue - whether to our social lives, our love life, our physical lives. That day must have come and gone for me, while I was busy in other worlds with you.  That's the kind of thing we would do anyways. I'd get lost in another world and instead of trying to follow me there you'd bring that world down here where we could both adventure.   And this works when you're young, adventuring with the dinosaurs, and the spacemen, and the warriors of fictional masterpieces. But things became a bit more difficult as I started to follow my mother's guidance and other people's voices that I knew or didn't know.   And it works when you're playing with wooden swords and sticks and paper airplanes. But it becomes a bit more difficult as you start playing with cat scans and doctors and medicines and refusals.   It even worked as you followed me through the woods, and into that alleyway, and even  to the hidden shopkeeper who sold magical potions. All on this epic quest to find my mother who still sent me directions even though I couldn't find her!   She led me to the graveyard where last she'd been seen, and with dirt encrusted nails you were with me there too. And I suppose someone thinks it's a problem to dig a bunch of holes in the ground to look for a loved one. I don't really get it.   So I know we promised to always stick with each other, but I think this time it's different. They say I can't have visitors and I'm ""at risk."" So I have to say goodbye, and promise that never shall we ever adventure again.    First time I've ever written something on here haha, go easy.

""...you jump in front of me! We both decided I would go willingly."" She started hitting my chest, ""You wanted to be a hero, well, now you're going to die a hero. Did you ever think about the people you would leave behind?"" The clouds engulfed the sky entirely as hair and the smell of salt hit me.  ""Dar-"" I started hacking.

I was six at the time and she was busy trying to put Toby down for nap so I guess it's only fair that she wasn't really listening.   When I told her at age ten that we were being watched she laughed nervously and ruffled my ink-black hair.  'Such imagination you have!'  'No, really!' I tried to make her see but Toby had decided at that moment to eat our pet cat, starting with its tail. She was gone.   I spent that entire summer watching the things that were watching us. Each day it was the same routine; pack a lunch, a blanket, my notebook and my dad's binoculars before heading out to the pasture that rolled up to the ancient forest just outside my house.  Being on stakeout isn't what you think it is. Mostly it's dull and the thing you're doing most is trying to stay awake but still, there are worse ways to spend a summer.  Like in a looney bin, for starters.   That's where I spent my 12th summer, after mom had found the notebook. Okay, it wasn't really a bin so much as it was Dr. Pliseman's office twice a week but he had a way of talking to you that left you knowing without a doubt that he imagined you in a white padded cell. Our sessions were very therapeutic. In them, I learned the value of a lock and that adults were not to be trusted.   Except that now I am one.

The village master hoped one man might be able to conceal himself as a creature of the forest; no one actually thought it would work. They were right.  He felt the eyes herding him away from his mission like wolves, constantly striking him with fear and forcing him east instead of north. They never left him. Eventually the eyes became mouths. There were glimmering teeth accompanying the oddly colored orbs. There were jaws, opening and closing, and there were tongues slithering out, tasting the air. Tasting Ben.
