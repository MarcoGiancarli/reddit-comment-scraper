awakened,3e6ank,SWo777,3,Wed Jul 22 07:47:43 2015 UTC,"Others might have different thoughts to share, but what immediately comes to mind for me are the two major paths to enlightenment that are spoken about in Hinduism.   One is called bhakti, which may be translated as the way of devotion. One dedicates themselves to God, one sees only the Divine in everything. One becomes totally for God and one could say, dependent on God. God or Goddess, depending on which personification works for someone, becomes the Beloved. Love for and from others is seen as the love of God. Fear and difficulty are given over to God in trust that the Divine will guide and keep. You can see this expressed in Sufi poetry, and in the Psalms.  The other primary path is the path of the jnani, which is the path of spiritual knowledge and contemplation. One dedicates themselves to understand the Divine through contemplative reading of scriptures such as the Upanashads, or works of enlightened masters. Meditation may also be used as a prepatory exercise.  These could also be called the paths of the heart and the head. Though they seem separate, eventually, they cross into each other. As the heart awakens the the divine love expressed in and as everything, then divine wisdom begins to emerge. As the mind awakens to the great mystery beyond opposites, the heart begins to open to to our fundamental unity.  Each culture seems to have their own points of entry for these sorts of things, with their own flavor. But that's my view on the matter, that Psalms are an expression of the way of the devotion.   So ... when one is found does one stop seeking?   My advice is not to stop seeking until you directly understand why to stop seeking. Seeking has a purpose. You'll hear people say ""seeking is what's blocking you"" or ""you are the one you are looking for"", but it can be premature to take that advice without some seeker work under your belt. It's like if someone gave you a huge mansion and told you about all of the rooms and then said, ""So, now that I've told you, just stay in this one room because it's the best, and don't worry about actually looking at the rooms I just told you about."" You wouldn't know anything about this grand house you're living in or why this room is supposedly the best. Seeking is exploration, and in my experience, it's the act of seeking that will help you recognize when the seeking is over."

You said:     I can't help but feel answers can create immense confusion and in a net analysis, provides much more harm than good.    That's a belief.  You then provide multiple paragraphs of rationalizations about it.  Do you have experience with how awakening deepens through the deconstruction of belief?  When it comes down to it, the truth is you actually don't know whether what goes on here is ""net good,"" ""net bad,"" nor do you even know which criteria is the proper criteria to even judge such a thing.

Actually, that is a great way to frame it because this is exactly the kind of proclamation that I refer to except I'm framing it as can be instead of the more usual is and I am referring to something ultimately not spiritual as opposed to the spiritual. If you can see the same problem that I see but with my ""secular"" analysis, complete with a thesis and supporting arguments (belief and rationalization as you frame it), then you should certainly be able to apply the same perspective to posts more akin to baseless speculation.   One can judge the situation by elevating one's perceptions to the status of ultimate truth, or we can remain open-minded to the vastness of possibility.   You could do that but you're not struggling so much as a seeker, are you? To be perfectly honest, I still don't quite see what your point so long as I give the benefit of the doubt and assume that this isn't an attempt to educate me.   Maybe they're meaningless buzzwords, maybe you have a lot more to learn.

awakened,3e435b,sovereign_self,4,Tue Jul 21 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"I can accept selfish reasons for the sharing of answers, such as the intention to do good by sharing all your fancy wisdom, but is this defensible in light of what I just said?    Funny you say that, because it turns out, after all, that I have no intention to do good or to help people. I don't believe, in any way, that anyone needs help. And everything I do is for purely selfish reasons.  For example, the whole spiel on the ego yesterday came about because, night before last, as I was going to sleep, the metaphor just arose in front of me without thought. I saw the question in the sub the next morning, the metaphor returned, and it was like ""boom, that's why that came up last night.""  Or the question yesterday regarding the empty mind. That's something that spoke directly to my heart; I have experience with that. Something in me wanted to join with that experiential description in understanding.  Words can't explain how little intention or thought or desire or planning goes into anything I share, nor the way I share it. I'm true to whatever it is that has the will to do that, and it's not upon me to stop it from happening in the way it happens. If I do, it hurts.  I don't care if everyone loves what I said or hates what I said, I only care that I was true to whatever wanted to be expressed. That's all I care about. The end.  So that's just my little intro explanation, if, for some reason, you were directing this in my general vicinity.  Now, onto your point:  I think I can safely use the two of us as a good example, because we're pretty diametrically different in the personality department (and I love you for that).  You came to your understanding in a vastly different way, in a vastly different dynamic, than I did. As we both know, this created some friction in our discussions. Not to say that I didn't get some value out of it, but the type of ""teacher"" you were trying to be at the time wasn't what I needed.   I needed long, winding, poetic books full of metaphors to contemplate, flowery words to bask in, and reassurance that, above all else, being gentle with myself was absolutely permissible. You (and others, so I'm not singling you out) took a more rod to the face approach. I was giving myself plenty of rods to the face without needing more, to be sure.  We teach what we know. We teach the way we learned/unlearned. That's how it goes.  If I was going to hope for anything in any of the responses I ever post, it would be that some turn of a phrase sparks a desire in someone to contemplate, because contemplation and realization are two sides of the same coin. Contemplating necessarily infers that realization will be shortly coming, if not immediate.   What got me to contemplate? Turns of phrases and metaphors. So it just naturally follows that that's the kind of stuff that comes out of ""me"" now.  Having experienced talking about this ""IRL"" and talking about this via words online, they are two different beasts. There is no immediate feedback and no immediate knowing. The best you do is what you do, and trust that life finds its way in the midst of all of that. I mean, even in ""real life,"" it's the same thing, but much more dynamic.  Which brings me to my last point: Trust.  This is something I felt was severely lacking in this subreddit when I was going through ""the change."" No one seemed to trust that anyone else could find their way, so they would chastise them and call them names or judge them as incompetent or push them into areas that were entirely unrelated to the trajectory they were on. Moreover, as a general rule, this sub also tends to be heavily mind-centered and analytical, which is part of the whole awakening story, but by no means the full thing, which is exactly why we're seeing an influx of people who are really struggling with awakening in general. There's more that should be shared, more that should be said, no matter how uncomfortable it makes those who lean towards the analytical and formulaic.   If there's one thing I think we could all use a huge dose in, it's trust. Trust that no matter what your negative opinion is about what's going on, it's probably very wrong.  But I do very much appreciate the fact that you're looking out for the wellbeing of the people in this sub, if that's what you're doing (and not just annoyed by other people taking an approach you don't think is right). It's very conscientious of you. That's not tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic, by the way. I don't think.    EDIT: A fun analogy. It's like we're trying to clear the shit from the path for those who follow after, forgetting that we are shitting everywhere too.   Actually, that's not a correct analogy. ""Clearing the path"" doesn't have anything to do with the words that are spoken. The path is cleared inside. Not a single word, not a single question, not a single thing written or spoken, will ever have anything to do with clearing the path, no matter what ""approach"" you take, no matter what you declare or don't declare, no matter, no matter, no matter. Ever. The ""energy"" behind those things may, but the words themselves never will.  I know what energy I speak with; that's as far as it goes.  tl;dr Being helpful isn't an intention I have, and whether or not it's helpful isn't my business.    Just as a little postscript: I have a feeling that my time on this sub is coming to a close; I've been feeling it for a while now. It's going to be massively appropriate if my last post ever is a long, drawn-out response to your griping about something, as that's how my time here started in the first place. God, I hope it ends this way, though I'm not holding my breath. <3 <3 <3"
awakened,3e435b,sovereign_self,4,Tue Jul 21 22:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah!  I don't see the /r/awakened community as having teachers leading a flock. I see us as a rag-tag group of spiritual misfits, without a lineage and without an external guru. Some of us studied books or videos. Others had awakening just happen one day. We come together, here, in r/awakened, a place rather unique on the web—how the hell did we find this place, anyway?—for community, for satsang, perhaps without even knowing what satsang means.  We're children of the age of the shrinking globe and information ubiquity. We're not following one lineage, we're following all lineages. We're forging our own paths, together, and describing the scenery as we go. We help where we feel pulled to help. We don't help where it appears that it's not our place.  It's not always a clean process, from certain perspectives. But I've come to see that we can trust that the Truth will guide each to where they need to be. It's inescapable, because it's what we are.    ""Clearing the path"" doesn't have anything to do with the words that are spoken. The path is cleared inside.   This.  Confusion will right itself. If someone asks for answers and takes them only as mental comfort, eventually the comfort will no longer work. That's the nature of the mind. It is clear to anyone who is looking. Then, the mechanism of unanswered introspection that /u/king3x speaks of will kick in.   But it seems that a lot of times the explanations serve, as you mention, as a place for contemplation. They may also serve as a release to help a mind transcend a more limited perspective in order to let go further into the mystery.   And for the writer or speaker of the 'explanations', they are songs. Nothing more. Nothing less."

But I guess this is what I mean about us being an unusual group. And online. If we had chosen to go to a Zen monastery, we would be in a controlled environment with a single ""source"" of answers, and that teacher could use any method or nonmethod that was appropriate. Socratic. Contradictory. Silence. Because of the assumed authority of the teacher and the assumed path that the student believed they were on, the student would diligently work until they paradoxically figured out that it can't be figured out.  We're on the Internet. We don't have these guiderails. We have to wing it, and all we've got to help us wing it is that still small voice. And, for me, it often feels that simply responding by asking an introspective question will not have the intended effect in this medium.  edit: So, to your question, I think that it's hard to say if answers create distance. But some answers helped me, or seemed to. Not because I took anything at face value, but because when someone says ""x"", I didn't say, ""Oh, x. There it is."" I recognized that ""x"" is their perspective. And I cross-referenced that to others' explanations and saw correlations. And even then, I recognized it as a pointer, and until it was direct, it was nothing to stand on. (Even then, it's no-thing to stand on).  Maybe I'm naïve to think that others may contemplate in this fashion. I don't know. But what do you suggest? Shut down all spiritual discussion? Only respond with questions?"

I don't know if you remember several months ago when I purposefully went at it with another user who's prone to doing the same sort of thing (though not quite as skillfully or with as much heart), but it was because I was literally STARVING for someone to give me something that hurt, something that felt yucky.  And it wasn't there anymore. That kind of pain was completely gone, and it hasn't ever come back. The only thing left was a sense of slightly amused curiosity.  So my point is, that pain shows you what is still there to be removed, and it will be. Every time it comes up, it's a goldarned blessing. It keeps you honest with yourself, and it keeps you hungry for deeper realization.  So, yeah.

Excuse the poor analogy but it's like giving someone answers to the homework; you have only the best intentions but you're assuming that the person cannot figure it out for themselves.

Now that I more thoroughly understand what you're talking about, given this last response, my thoughts are (with love) that you're being a little passive-aggressive and vague, when you should be doing what you're really good at doing, which is calling people out in the environments and the moments in which they're committing the infractions you're seeing. You're really good at that. Really.  And my thoughts are that over the last few weeks, I saw many opportunities in which I actually hoped you would come along and do so.  This sub needs you's as much as, or probably more so sometimes, as it needs me's.   t is simply not analytical enough; rigor is applied for good reason.   I don't know if I can get you to understand this, because it wasn't your experience, but mine did not involve analytical thought. At all.  It involved a lot of feeling and a lot of inner stretching, a lot of realizations that occurred outside of thought, and a lot of surrender, in finding the inner trajectory that took me straight home. Analytical thought didn't really play a huge part in it at all.  It can happen many ways, I guess, is what I'm getting at. I absolutely see the value in analytical thought. But it's neither foolproof nor the way for everyone.   Especially if those answers aren't 'correct' or complete.   I know what you're talking about, and I see it in the way you see it, as well.   Again, this is why we need people with the capabilities and gifts that you have. Whipping someone into sanity when they're obviously overstepping their inner knowledge is not my forte. It's yours.   Not many people vibe with my approach to things as I tend to be more rod-to-face than most.    It's a blessing, when it's appropriate (and definitely now that you've matured more). Saying some of what you, as you, kind of have to say in order to stay true to you can't be fun, when you know it's just going to piss people off. I guess I just want to take this opportunity to tell you that I appreciate it, even when I didn't when it was directed at me, and ... what's the word? Commiserate, I guess.   I think it's a problem when people are flooded with information way, way above their level of comprehension.   I agree.

It can make putting two sentences together in the ""right"" way feel like torture.  I'm not sure anyone should be punished for not ""thinking right"" in reaching out to share, when they're going through that.    That's why discrimination is best when it comes to the way you call people out.

Comfort promotes the short-term emotional well-being of a seeker but that fosters something dangerous – an inclination toward seeking comfort in a thought.   I recently noticed this has been happening a lot. I have been reading and re-reading different texts and saved passages by Nisargadatta, Ramana, and others because it provides me a sense of comfort; confirming the realization, and providing a temporary reprieve from what feels like a struggle (at times) to undo the swaths of egoic conditioning that are lingering.   I picked up one more book a few days ago, the first one I'd started reading by J. Krishnamurti, and while reading it I realized that I have simply been creating and reinforcing another belief system about how I think truth-realization is supposed to unfold. Although I recognized initially that the doer is a fiction, and there is still awareness of that truth, I have been living as though there is a doer, just a more spiritually inclined doer.   Not sure where to go from here. I suppose it's a relief knowing that I'm not in control of what goes on from here anyway, even this sense of feeling I am a doer is just the universe doing its thing. However that helps."

awakened,3e435b,insanitybecomes,3,Tue Jul 21 22:38:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone is a teacher and as student, just doing their best. This whole thing relies on so many dualistic distinctions  that we often talk about as being illusory here that I don't know how to respond to this. How people react to things they read on the internet is not the responsibility of the authors. Misunderstanding is an opportunity to learn, if seized I don't see a problem.   The more I think about it, I don't think making such a clear distinction between teacher and student is very healthy for a community. I guess it depends on what kind of community you want. It is not the case that there are folks here who only have things to teach, or folks who only have things to learn. This feels like a sophisticated form of 'in' group, those who know better and those who don't."

I basically stopped explaining things, and by proxy posting on reddit, because my explanations were necessarily arbitrary, the results of the explanations ambiguous, and many of the sub-realizations of experiential presence are actually valueless in terms of feeling, and most people want good feelings. And they should, really. Many aspects of nonduality or awakening or however you want to phrase it, are really only interesting to people who have a strong desire for truth for its own sake. I was one such person. My desire for cold hard truth was quenched. I had found the facts of experiential reality, as far as I could know it. Then for a while, I tried explaining and sharing a little bit out of compassion for other obsessive people.  Now, all of my experiential realizations remain, all of the experiments I did bore fruit in my mindstream, but I care very little about the ideas. I've renounced myself as an authority on anything, and now my focus is on goodness rather than truth. And so, in large part, I remain silent."

awakened,3dytzv,psychohyperbole,20,Mon Jul 20 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind, but I feel like really going into a wordy, winding, slightly misleading metaphor of what ego is. My apologies if it's unhelpful or boring.   But let's look at the ego as if it was the muscles of an arm.  So you have this guy (we'll call him Awa, short for awareness) who wakes up one day with a completely clean mind, total amnesia. Doesn't know how to move or what to do. Except he has this friend who tells him, ""You need to have a strong right arm to make it in this world,"" and Awa doesn't know any better, so he believes his friend, just like a child believes his parents.  Awa starts working out this arm, constantly, so he can ""make it in the world,"" and his arm muscles get bigger and bigger. Pretty soon, Awa is moving about the world by dragging himself around with just this one arm. And it's working! (Not to mention, everyone he sees seems to be dragging themselves around by just one arm, too, so nothing seems amiss about that).  It may be tough and stressful and tiring, but his right arm is SO strong, he can at least get from here to there by moving around with it.  Somewhere in there, though, Awa totally forgets that he has a whole body with which to move. The bulk and strength of his right arm totally consumes his life, his time. He has to keep that thing in shape, because it's the only thing that gets him around in the world. And his other arm, his legs, his head - all of the rest of it is either forgotten or written off as unnecessary. To him, he's just an arm and nothing more. He is eternally skipping leg day.  So if we look at ego as if they were the muscles of the right arm, who is the one who is making it big and bulky, the center of life, and the only way to get around in the world? It's not the arm itself - the arm wouldn't get any bigger if he didn't pay constant attention to it. It's not the arm's fault that it's being exercised without discrimination.  So cutting off the arm doesn't make a lot of sense, right? It's as helpful as anything else in Awa's body. But it's very unhealthy for it to be exorbitantly large and the only thing Awa believes is keeping him moving in the world. It's unbalanced for the right arm to be GINORMOUS, while the rest of the body wastes away unused.  ""Ego death"" could be likened to Awa suddenly realizing he has an entire body that has the ability to move him, so he stops paying so much attention to the arm, AND he stops believing that the arm is what needs to move him through life. But the arm's still there, were he to need it.  Awakening is discovering your whole body, and realizing that your legs, as it were, do a much better job at moving you. And that your arm (the ego) is great when you want to grab something for a minute and look at it or play with it, and that's it.  But at the core of all of it is Awa. He's the one who makes his ego big, or ignores it, or keeps everything in balance. If he tried to cut off his arm without discovering his whole body, what would happen?  So the moral of this whole metaphor is this:  You don't have to kill the ego. You just have to stop paying attention to it. Because you've been moving around using only it as your vehicle, it's super strong and habitual to return to as your mode of transportation. But the more you start walking with the other vehicle you have at your disposal (which is the whole of Awareness), the less important and strong the ego becomes.  But it's really, really, really important that Awa understands his WHOLE body, first, before using his arm again. Imagine if he discovers his left toe, too, and then he's trying to get around using only his left toe and his right arm. Imagine that.   Even sillier.  That's where a lot of spiritual aspirants find themselves upon having a few small realizations. ""OH! I'm not just an arm, I'm also a big left toe!"" Heh.  Anyway, to make this even longer, the question you've posed is like Awa, believing he's only his right arm, asking, ""How can I kill my right arm?"" It just can't happen, nor should it. Awa just needs to realize who he really is. When he realizes that, the silliness of killing his right arm would be apparent."

awakened,3dytzv,Elhippiesamurai,5,Tue Jul 21 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"From ""Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi""   [Student]: How is the ego to be destroyed?  [Ramana Maharshi]: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks the question? It is the ego. This question is a sure way to cherish the ego and not to kill it. If you seek the ego you will find that it does not exist. That is the way to destroy it.   My interpretation: investigate that conventional sense of a self directly and find out its true illusoriness for yourself. If we don't do this but just want some sort of special experience that seems to be like self-lessness, then this might just our intact ego that wants to have a nice feeling of 'self-lessness,' not to disappear by being investigated."
awakened,3dytzv,Citta_Viveka,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"If one could ""kill"" the ego, this implies that there is both something being killed and a killer. This dichotomy, in fact, just reinforces the Ego itself (as the killer). So it seems to me this way of thinking is just another subtle way that the Ego tries to continue itself as a independently existingm discrete entity.  To avoid this trap, in Buddhism and Hinduism, they speak more often of ""seeing through"" the Ego, or of gaining insight into its nature. This type of thinking brings in the element of ""seeing clearly"" (i.e. insight/knowledge) as the necessary means for dismantling the Ego.  That being said, ""killing"" the Ego may be a very good metaphor for certain people at certain times in their practice. I for one have used this notion before, and it can be skillful. I think it is just important though, not to be mislead by what essentially are metaphors, and continue the practice of meditation and clear seeing."

awakened,3dytzv,hockiklocki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"One shouldn't even try to kill the ego. You need an ego (sense of self, the first person view) to be a human. One should learn to use it in the right way.  Ego is a mask of division. The world in its entirety is made of one substance, but ego- for the obvious reasons - divides world into food and poison, water and earth, friends and enemies, etc. Obviously in humans the ego also divides ones experience into ""I"" and ""world"". Precisely this last division is what makes all the problems. Because in reality there is no division between you and the world, however ego - in order to function, needs this division. This creates a contradiction. A contradiction within ego itself.   Now - the point of awakening is to learn to live with this contradiction - to master your ego - that is to gain a distance to it, such distance that will allow you to observe yourself in order to avoid mental fuckups. Egotists for example can not live with this contradiction of ego being both one with the world, but perceiving it as separated from itself. Egotists therefore will cling to the idea of ultimate separation - the world will be divided, segregated (like racially even) with non-crossable borders - to the point of religious fanatism, areas of tabu, all this to hide the basic fact of personal connection to everything else - it's the root of all violence really - this pain of contradiction. Egotist, by segregating the world tries to erase the idea of unity from his mind - the only idea that hurts the ego so much. It is this kind of pain an egotist can not bare.  So - an awaken person is conscious of this ambiguity of ego - to do that you may use the old technique of adressing yourself in third person (just dont make a habit of it, can make you crazy)  Have a one day in a week, the ""He - saturday"" f.ex., when you think of yourself, and do everything in 3rd person - you may give orders to yourself, or comment on your behaviour - all that crazy stuff. It gives you an additional perspective. Just don't overdo it. When you reach the point of understanding, quit the rutine. If it gets into your habit it can ruin your life.  You want me to explain more - ask me a question."

Is awareness an omnipresent field?   I'm pretty sure nobody can answer that one with any certainty, but you'll see what I gather in my answers to your other questions. In our current position, contained by these meat suits, we do not experience awareness as an omnipresent field except perhaps in meditation or when chemically modified. Rather, we experience it in isolation, and that may only be because that's the way you wanted to experience it at this moment. But the fact that any sense beyond the physical exists at all seems to suggest that awareness is something more, and just ""is"" before, after, and during the time it perceives you as separate from me, and this coffee.    Am I you?    Yes you found me! You are also everyone and everything else. The bird singing outside is you, as is the bug that scurried under the cabinet when you turned on the light overnight. They are all you and share your awareness, but conditioned with a different payload of memories and experiences, which lead to the illusion of separation. One awareness, but many personalities that perceive I as separate. When you help any living thing in need, you are helping yourself, and this is precisely why helping another is the most satisfying thing you can do.   There is also everything else (wind, sun, water, stone, fire, dust, and so on), still you, but without the payload, aware only so much as you are aware of it… experiencing yourself, as if it were something separate, but it is not. It's not a bad thing, you wanted this experience.  I like to think of us as software we created to experience ourself. Even if it's far from a perfect analogy, I think it may be accurate on a few points. There is one awareness, just like there is one codebase. But that code runs on a potentially infinite number of machines. Awareness is highly portable, able to execute on any particle or system of particles. The software can be copied, clone itself, and even create new systems upon which to run. Each instance of the software only knows of itself within the context of the machine that it is currently running on. That is the limit of its perception, but it is in fact something entirely different. The machines come and go, but the software just is and always is. Awareness is not software obviously, so just take it for the analogy.    Can I control anything?    Yes and No. Yes if ""control"" implies create. You can create just about anything, including life itself. Since our perception in this state is physical and time-based, all creation and control follows a cause and effect pattern. These are the constraints, and that's part of the experience that you intended. You have to first imagine as if it were real (and keep doing it), then move forward and be persistent to create/control something. (Creative Visualization is a good book about this). When your awareness is outside of the physical, time-based system, control and creation is instant, but [from what I gather] about as satisfying as buying a pre-built lego ship, rather than really building a ship with legos.   No if ""control"" means manipulate. While you can to some extent, controlling things beyond their natural flow implies resistance, which you've got to be careful with, as it only takes away from you. Recognizing when something is out of your control (which can be hard to do) and letting it be is usually the best path. On the other hand, if a fire is small enough that you can put it out before it burns the whole house down, then don't let it just ""be"" – control it with a fire extinguisher. Likewise, if you've got kids, letting things ""be"" is not always the best parenting. Control the things you are responsible for, take good care and exercise control where you can be of helpful service. Accept everything else and let it be.   Should it be shared with others or not?    Real truth exists absolutely and doesn't need to be shared, because it will never be lost. Real truth doesn't need dogma, people to spread it, buildings to practice it, books written about it, or anything at all. You already know, and if what you know is truth, then they already know too, somewhere. It will be in their foreground when they are ready or want it to be. No need to share unless asked and you feel they are ready and it would resonate with them. The truth will always be there, and chances are our understanding of it is never complete in this lifetime, if it even matters. I think part of our reason for being here with the illusion that we are isolated from one another is to experience the not knowing, and to gain understanding from this perspective. If that's what was intended, then it's likewise something you want to treat with respect and let everyone find their own path to. I hope that I understood your questions correctly. Again, take this all with a grain of salt."

awakened,3dvo9i,psychohyperbole,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. There are plenty of philosophical works that deal exactly with this question. Look up empiricism.  Edit: also, Phenomenalism, and Rationalism. From there you could go a million ways."
awakened,3dvo9i,DrunkenAdama,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"You just discovered solipsism.  Solipsism is a form of philosophical ideology.  The problem with you is that you imagine reality to be something detached from your senses, something on the other side of your eye, something besid your ears, but in fact what are you trying to do (or more precisely - your egotist part) - is to sustain this image of yourself as radically distinct from the so called ""reality around you"".   Your ego encounters this problem - everything - your senses, your cells, your mind, the environment - is made basically of the same substance, from atoms composed of same fundamental particles. The evidence all around you tell your ego it in fact is somehow a part of greater structure, just a slice of reality. And so your ego defends itself violently -as ego always does - with a sort of philosophical violence (ideology). Remember - the holy thing ego is trying to defend is this radical division - this border between itself and world. The facts show that world is one, but the ego holds, that there is a gap between itself and the reality. Therfore ego creates the (absurd) statement of solipsism according to this lines: ""I'm a separate being, there is a radical distinction between me and the rest of it, but since the evidence show it is all connected, therfore it must all be part of me.""  Do you get it?  This is the last trick of ego which wants to remain intact. Otherwise it would have to undergo - what is called ""symbolic castration"" - that is to admit it does not hold a special, central place in the reality, despite it perceives it to be so - in other words the ego would have to admit the very idea of separation, autonomy, the border itself is just the way it operates, not the reality of world.  Ego can not remain in the primary, primitive complete form without being self-assured about its autonomy. When the world around it prooves over and over the lack of autonomy, the fatal entanglement, maybe even a mechanical imprisonment in the structure of world - the eogo freaks out and creates this solipsistic dream of itself somhow containing the whole world, and therefore pulling all the strings. It is a really sad thing to watch - this is how all the egotists function and usually they use it for eradicating all mentioned evidence of borderless world - they will create violent divisions, ideological segregations - just to remain philosophically detached from the world.  TL;DR; No it does not make sense. You can simply not accept the facts about yourself being a part of greater structure of the world, not a fully autonomous being."

To me, they were sourced from the divine, which is within me and all of us. It is only my own limitations that prevent me from seeing this of every thought. We are used to discarding thought as epiphenomena -- as stuff that emerges like wake off a boat and doesn't affect anything. Even the wake is important. The cosmos provides grace by all means, in all ways. Everything, even the bewildering minutia of thought, reflects truth."
awakened,3dvqm8,sarvaga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome, love what you wrote sarvaga!  What would you say about negative thoughts?   Let's say that I have unnecessary and illogical social anxiety because of past experiences. And I go to a party and experience negative thoughts ""dont talk to her, she wont like you"", ""your awkward"" etc.. stuff like that.  Those thoughts don't really reflect truth. Perhaps they reflect truth from previous experiences.. but those thoughts seem to come from the past ego mind rather than sourced from the divine.  And meanwhile I'll have thoughts exactly how you beautifully described.. as if sourced from the divine.  Perhaps it's a yin/yang or prickle/goo sort of thing?   As in all thoughts are God, but thought can be both either divine truth or ego? (and I guess we never really know what it is except through our feeling of it? and even our feeling can decieve us at times..)  Curious if you have any thoughts on that?"
awakened,3dvqm8,sarvaga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"Negative thoughts reflect a certain truth in that they are sourced from pain/memory that is deeply embedded in the body/mind, which forms a thought habit. Resisting these thoughts puts them in a permanent loop. It's not that the content of the thought is true, although it is true in a relative sense. The thought ""you're awkward,"" for example, might reflect someone's habitual thought patterns that are (in fact) defining their reality. The hard thing is accepting the negative thought without accepting its truth proposition. That's why these patterns have to be investigated with an open heart and a certain detachment, since the mind will just continue regressing into the same pattern if left to its own devices. The mind is a fractal machine in that way.  So, I think it's not so much accepting thought, as investigating its source and accepting the pain which leads to a cycle of negative thoughts. It's complex, though... it's always a hall of mirrors. That's why it's important to keep the mind in its proper place and function without living there."

awakened,3dt50z,jake_da_dawg,11,Sun Jul 19 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"Our view of world can be dissected into three parts, as Lacan puts it - the real, the virtual, and the imaginary. Every conscious look at the world will always be a mix of those three.  The present moment - I assume - you understand as the immediate, sensoric input - as the real part of it. However this ""real"" itself is already very complicated, when you take into account your psychology. The immediate experience of the world is always filtered through previous experiences, your senses respond according to what they've learned prior to the experience. If your senses are not trained they will distinguish less information, etc. And that's just a basic level of perception.  There is than the virtual perception - perception through language, through symbolic structures of meaning, ability to reflect on yourself as a Individual inside a set of coordinates, a person occupying a place not only in space, but also in society, in relationships with others, maybe even in history, in art, in all the other ""systems"" of reference.   The third part of your perception is the imaginary - the most ellusive, but also most surprising - the dreaming awake - the religious, the mythical, the story-like aspect of your consciousness. You may observe strings of strange coincidences, you may meet strange personalities which seem mythical, maybe angellic, maybe you may witness all sorts of miracles - and so on. This is the imaginary part of your experience - your mind inventing an amazing story about the world.  All those three aspects of experience converge in the so called ""present moment"" and can not exist one without the other - you may not be aware of their distinction, you may perceive them as one, but their interrelation is a very strange and not-so obvious one. Being aware is precisely being aware of those relations.  For example, what I wrote above was a dissecting of this experience we call reality - into real reality, virtual reality, and imaginary reality.  But the virtual (for example an philosophical concept of world) can also be represented as consisting of three, lets call it - flvours - the real virtual (the symbolic structure of beliefs), the virtual virtual (a higher order of symbolism, meta philosophy, etc.), and the imaginary virtual ( a philosophy which you invent, which you experiment with, which comes to you in dreams, in feelings, etc.).  And for the imaginary part as well - you can have real imaginary (like proper dreams), virtual imaginary ( for example computer game worlds - an experience of dream like reality of computer games), imaginary imaginary (the imagination about imagination, dreams within dreams, or perhaps dreams about someone elses dreams, etc.)  Being awake is living with the full consciousness of the layers of the experience, the past and future converging in it, the hopes and dreams skewing it, the memories through which, as through some shades, you experience the present, the religious and philosophical, or maybe general cultural programs that rule your interpretation of what you see. Awareness of all the dimensions of this mysterious experience of ""present"" is what I understand of being ""awake""."
awakened,3dt50z,hockiklocki,2,Sun Jul 19 06:43:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for taking the time to write that. It was so insightful. I've never thought of reality and awakening in that way before. Thank you for such a detailed response.
awakened,3dt50z,Dreamtoto,6,Sun Jul 19 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"You are always in the present moment. Whether you accept or resist what is happening in your experience defines how you live in each moment. Total acceptance is ""enlightenment."" It is to allow life to flow through you unimpeded without fear or attachment. In fact, awareness already does this; it's a matter of dissolving that which makes you identify with something other than the ""knower."" For most undergoing ""awakening,"" experience progressively dissolves into this undifferentiated whole. Most of us aren't good at this (or really, we don't think we want it or we delay it). We prefer resisting or grasping the world. That's fine, too."
awakened,3dt50z,sarvaga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Nicely said sarvaga!  However, I'd say ""for most undergoing awakening, experience progressively dissolves into this..""  I'd say that at times it goes the other way too. That life / the universe / god / whatever you want to call it will bring into your life MORE challenges and more chaos to see if you can accept or resist it.  A silly example is that when one becomes a Jedi in star wars.. improving one's jedi skills is not a progressively easy thing to do/be. As you become a better and better jedi it's not like you just accept more and more of what is... but rather more and bigger challenges happen as they grow their jedi awareness! (metaphor for awakening).  Luke SkyWalker when the most aware of the force after many years of jedi training and experience (awakening).. that THAT is when he fights vader and palpatine and the whole rebel alliance is relying on him. (he experiences the MOST chaos)  so rather than awakening being a progressive thing.. awakening actually brings MORE chaos into your life imo.  Awakening is more like a heart beat. in, out, in, out, in, out.  expanding, contracting, expanding, contracting.  But perhaps the ""awakening"" is expanding a tiny bit more, so you can contract a tiny bit more, and then expand even more than last expansion, etc. etc. something like that.  that's why i really loved your answer of ""You are always in the present moment"".  Nice post sarvaga"
awakened,3dt50z,GJLuke,2,Sun Jul 19 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Life does seem to challenge you more, and all order breaks down since you don't have your habitual belief patterns to take refuge in. All there is is a constantly churning maelstrom of experience. It's totally disorienting, and surrendering to it is really your only option when you're that far down the rabbit hole.    Awakening is more like a heart beat. in, out, in, out, in, out. expanding, contracting, expanding, contracting. But perhaps the ""awakening"" is expanding a tiny bit more, so you can contract a tiny bit more, and then expand even more than last expansion, etc. etc. something like that.   Yeah this is true. In my experience, the expansion is always (mercifully) greater. If you surrender even an inch of suffering to life, it'll take you a hundred miles. But then it'll test you again. There's always the contraction, but if you can move with this contraction and accept it, even the contractions are filled with a dark but profound beauty. How else would we see the light?   Good points all around."

You're going to grow up. There's nothing you can do to stop it. It's natural. What's happening now, though it doesn't seem to be as natural as, like, just growing up, it's even more natural than that.  The more you fight it, the more it's going to suck. It's a natural drive to awaken, far outside of ""your"" jurisdiction. You didn't choose to have lungs, nature chose that for you. This is much the same thing.

I'm sure many of us can relate to looking at everything around us and being able to poke holes in it and see it as a limited, negative reality. And yes, everything someone ever imagined does exist. And if we are experiencing it that is because we desire the experience. Our attention is the magnet.   If you're seeing demons it's because you are choosing it. The fear of something is the obsessive insistence it's real and that it has power over you. It does not but because we were never told how to deliberately place our attention and our concepts of the world were (mostly) either given to us by others (conscious mind) or carried over from other experiences in other lives (subconscious) we find ourselves at the mercy of these assumptions.

Can you imagine if your first four, five, six posts to this sub were regarded as Truth and nothing but Truth, worshipped, set in stone for all to follow as truth? That's what it seems like to me - he was just a dude who had several or even perhaps lasting realizations, wrote about them and what they seemed like they meant to him, and then somehow they ended up as infallible?  No, seriously. Think about that, with your first few posts. When I think about it with mine, it's horrifying. HORRIFYING! Ahhh!  Frankly, that's kind of what most of the Gnostic Gospels seem like to me, too. A bunch of people who've had experiences thanks to a great teacher, sitting around talking about what those experiences were like and what the teacher might've meant.  This subreddit is a great comparison, really.   Where the Nag Hammadi lost me was the extensive creation myth stuff, mainly because I have little interest in stories like that unless it's experientially verifiable. Maybe some day it will be. God knows, you never know."

Paul's epistles predate the Gospels so in NT context he wasn't losing the plot: he was writing it as he went. And even this is inaccurate when we consider that Christianity is an amalgamation of several pre-existing ideologies, including Judaism (obviously), Zoraostrianism, a number of Hellenic philosophical traditions (Neo-Platonism, Stoicism), and Egyptian mystery cults.   I suspect Paul was trying to bring together all these disparate elements into a single, coherent whole. In some ways he's right on the money (""the kingdom is within you,"" the oft-quoted Love passage in Corinthians, universal salvation) and in others he misses the mark altogether. So I guess he's no different from any other tradition: some Truth, some nonsense."

Do you have goals to one day be as deep in the recognition as they seem to be?     I would like to have the uninterrupted joy and clarity that teachers like them seem to possess, but if there's anything that this journey has shown me, it's that yearning for those qualities as something outside this moment is both a hindrance and a fools errand. A hindrance because I'm clinging to a concept, and a fool's errand because it can't be sought in the way we expect.   Do you have specific practices you are undertaking to aid in undoing the egoic conditioning that is present within yourself?   I meditate morning and evening if I feel moved to, which seems to be daily. Often at lunch as well. I also find myself lately to be really moving in to those uncomfortable mental moments when I feel judgement or boredom or frustration arise, and feeling them completely—honoring them—as I had noticed that I was just letting some of those moments a free pass to become identified.   How do you deal with the apparent necessity of working to earn a living?   Day by day. It's funny you should mention this now. Today, alternatives to typical work have been coming up a lot in my mind. I don't hate my job, but the impulse to find something more helpful to humanity has been growing. I'm actually sitting outside right now, because it's so beautiful, and I have nothing to do. I'm still not ready to just take a leap and hope my bills are paid.   What percentage of the day do you feel like you are in the witnessing state, as opposed to running around still pretending you are the separate I?   I don't know if it's that black and white. Sometimes I feel 'thin'. Sometimes I feel 'dense'. Maybe that just means that I'm still pretending. Who knows. I do notice that I have a lot more equanimity than 6 months ago when I was still trying to make more stuff happen. Even 3 months ago. I don't have as many seeker urges that pull me around. I think I'm learning to trust the present unfolding. I definitely still have my moments.   How do you define nonduality?   This.   If someone asks you what you believe in, what do you tell them?   I tell them I don't believe in anything. Beliefs are hindrances. But if they're looking for a glimpse into my cosmology, I might say something about unity or pantheism, depending on what seems to work for their paradigm.   What are your favourite ways of describing the recognition of spiritual enlightenment?    [Placeholder text so I can answer this more fully later.]  edit: Added answer.  I’ve found that when I speak or write of these things, I try to feel what’s available to be said in the moment. So, you might say that my favorite way to explain it is in a way that the person I’m telling it to will understand. What I enjoy is the understanding. I might go heavily metaphorical, or might use more abstract terms, depending on what they seem to know already. I might even start down one way of explaining, and have to pivot or redefine terms for clarity. It’s an interesting puzzle.  If I do try to recall some metaphors, I think that one that I liked was one I used in a reply to another recent post on this subreddit, which was essentially that we’re all already awake, and all that awakening amounted to uprooting the illusion of the personal self, much like a tree that’s obstructing the view of reality. It’s a little crude, but it tied in with my suggestion of going at the “root” of all obstructions.  I also recently used a metaphor likening the personal self to a hologram. If you had a really high resolution hologram, you might think it was a physical object. When you pass your hand through it and realize that it’s not real, it doesn’t destroy the hologram, but it changes all the assumptions that were based on it. Awakening is a bit like that in regard to who we think we are."

They're not spouting righteous or pious words. Like so many things in spirituality, I have come to find this to be simple direct instruction.   We like to fool ourselves into thinking we can split our goal. In my experience, I found myself wanting to continue having a focus on worldy ambition. I found myself wanting to defend myself against ""future threats"" to my reputation or intelligence. I discovered that I've had an entrenched defensive response to a friend of mine based on beliefs that he would 'get the upper hand'.   All of these things weren't bad in themselves. They were not morally wrong. Very simply, I noticed that they made me distinct from everyone else. They perpetuated the illusory sense of isolation and separateness, and would immediately ""take me out"" of unity.  The subtlety of it is relative. At one point it was subtle for me to notice that my road rage was doing the same thing. Road rage had been such a 'normal' part of driving, that I didn't immediately see it as anything that would stand in the way. But more and more, I noticed how it was creating a stronger sense of me.  Later, the subtlety got more... err... subtle. Actions or expressions wouldn't necessarily occur, but thoughts would. And thoughts would create that separation. This still continues.  Now, for anyone reading this, I don't want them to get the idea that I was judging and critizing and trying to suppress all this stuff. What I'm getting at is that a lot of these thoughts and responses felt like they should happen. It felt right and just to just go ahead and get mad. It felt appropriate and safe to be ambitious.   What was left for me to do wasn't to ban these things, but to recognize them for what they were: a focus on the illusory personal self and its limited aims, and not the truth. To begin to see these movements with the eyes of truth—with uncritical, nonjudging, accepting awareness. To let them arise and then come to them from truth and see if they remained.  These belief structures feel seductive until you really walk into them and get a good feel of them from the perspective of truth. Then you wonder how they ever seduced you. But that threshold must be crossed where they are met with truth. Until that happens, the personal mind is going to spin stories about how this reaction, or this personal goal is the most important thing right now. And since now is all there is, then it's the same as saying that it's more important than truth."

awakened,3dj51b,galaxyobserver,2,Fri Jul 17 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"What's the difference between awareness and consciousness? (Scientifically, you can lose consciousness, but can awareness ever check out from a body?)   When you talk to people about awakening, many people claim not to identify as a localized body-mind. They might say they ""are"" the field of awareness where perceptions occur. Yet any human communication originates from a brain that is processing auditory waves into language, holding ideas and beliefs (""I am...""), accessing memories and applying social skills the whole time. Isn't all this a localized ego/brain activity. Awareness can never speak, so how are these ideas shared truthfully?"
awakened,3dj51b,galaxyobserver,3,Fri Jul 17 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"I think that your questions are important, and they are ones that I have had many times. I don’t know if I will be able to satisfy your mind with my response, but I want to try my best to speak from my experience.  To start, let me zoom out a moment. One of the reasons that it seems that awakening is such a profound shift for people is because it is a perspective change. We are very entrenched in the physicalist point-of-view, that inert matter is primary and consciousness an emergent property of of neural networks in the brain. This seems to be confirmed by the very convincing sense that “I am in this body, and things other than me are outside of that.""  If I look back to my that first profound “awakening experience”, and the path I’ve been on since, I can see that in that moment, that I was directly experiencing how there’s a unified, alive, intelligent consciousness which is primary, and matter and forms are emergent properties within that. And since that time, the “unfolding” of that, as it were, is the falling away of all the belief structures that were built on that old paradigm of separate matter being primary.  So then, what are we? What is this body and brain, which clearly seem to have functions? From my point of view at the moment, you could kind of see physical reality like a computer simulation. Instead of a server farm running it somewhere, this simulation is self-running. It is made up of an alive awareness that we call consciousness.  Rules were set in motion at the start of this simulation (big bang), and they’ve been playing out ever since. Most points of matter are probably very simple consciousness. For example, the consciousness of a rock is probably just “is-ness”. Along the way, biological life came about, where molecules and water were somehow able to pattern themselves in such a way as to interact with their environment. They were able to record previous patterns of matter in increasingly complex ways in order for awareness to experience a continuity, or flow, through them. Eventually, that evolved into patterns that we call “human”, including the brain, with the capability for abstract thought—enough so that it could understand itself as part of the simulation.  Science isn’t wrong. It isn’t barking up the wrong tree. There’s only one tree. It’s just coming at it from a different side than spirituality is. It’s examining the forms. Spirituality is examining the awareness of forms.  So awareness is consciousness. What science calls consciousness in the brain is wakefulness of the body-mind structure. The alive awareness is underneath and before all of that.   The brain and the ego, then, are seen for what they are. They are tools or vehicles for interacting within the human experience. Absolutely—memories, thoughts, language, social skills, beliefs—these all originate in the pattern that we call a brain. Typically, we feel like these qualities are us. But that is what is seen through in the awakening process. We see that these are methods for experiencing, and what we are is before that. Behind that. Personal qualities are of us, but our essential nature is not of them. Before the awakening process, we feel that we are those personal qualities, thoughts, and belief structures, and so we bounce around in loops where we think every thought or emotion that we have is real and true and so I have to respond this way about it.   So, how does awareness speak through us? How does truth speak through ego?  There is that background of alive awareness. And the direct experience of it—meaning resting as that awareness, unattached to mental concepts—allows us to notice the spontaneous knowing that is always arising from it. Spontaneous means self-caused. It means that it didn’t come as a response to a belief structure or time-based concept. A knowing arises, it is felt in as a neutral feeling in the body (which we point to with the word ‘intuition', but that word has a lot of baggage that also points to emotional responses), and then that neutral feeling can be translated to words by the brain.   By contrast, the typical way we live life is to go stay in mind with our concepts. Our belief structures talk to our other belief structures, and it’s just a chain of causality: trigger and response. Trigger and response. Occasionally, we get moments that we call inspiration or creativity that make it through that web. Too often, though, we will quickly “own” this flash as “mine” and then incorporate it with our belief structures, or even discard it due to our belief structures."

awakened,3dj51b,guise_of_existence,3,Sat Jul 18 08:17:12 2015 UTC,"My life has been changed, and I feel more changes on the horizon. I live very presently. My focus is on living rather than achieving. More and more, I see things from the moment as they exist, rather than from a belief structure.  And I wouldn't say that I'm ""awakened"", because that implies an end and a separation. You're here, too. You're an essential part of this. What we call awakening is really a deepening of the knowing of just what, exactly, you are.  Here's my idea of what people mean when they say they have an awakening experience. Imagine you're standing in a room with a dim light. There's stuff in the room, but you can't really see it. It's all shadows and shapes. Maybe you start to make up stories about these shapes. You're afraid of the large one in the corner. The small one next to you makes you feel anxious. Two round ones to your right seem friendly.   Very slowly, the light begins to brighten. You may not even notice. But at some point, the light passes a threshold that lets you make out just what exactly those shapes are. And they're not at all what you thought they were! You had assigned all these ideas to them, but they were something else entirely. That ""aha"" moment feels special because of the perspective change, but it's really no more special than any other moment. It's you that changed.  (Now that I make that analogy, I realize that Plato did it much better with his ""Plato's Cave"" story.)  Anyway, my point is that awakening is not what you think. But at the same time, I'm not trying to convince you to go down this path of self-knowing. Many people don't, and that's OK.   If you do, then you're on a quest for truth. You'll have to question everything that you crave, that you hate, that you fear and that you believe. You very well might find that some of the things you think are most important to you are not important any more.   So, it's OK to be frightened. I still have fears. But if we wish to move forward on this quest for truth, then we have to have courage and walk into those dark places. Because we are the light that will illuminate them."

I've had really bad social anxiety for a number of years, and it was only getting worse. When I had that first ""awakening"" experience, that anxiety dropped dramatically. Now, a year later, it's hard to believe it was ever that bad. All of those social fears that I was creating were based on ideas that I had made up in my head.   If you ever do change your mind, consider finding a teacher. Buddhism is a good path that takes this carefully and slowly."

awakened,3dj51b,GJLuke,2,Sat Jul 18 08:23:54 2015 UTC,"Great question, and it's one that I have been looking at more very recently. I still have this occur, as well, and I saw it most clearly when I was visiting family.  What I've found is that it's a matter of bringing more and more presence into your daily life, so that the movement of being attached to pattern becomes more and more noticeable. Notice when you feel tension, and bring presence to that. Notice when you feel rushed, and bring presence to that. Notice when you feel like you need to put on a face for someone, and bring presence to that moment. Nothing more. No judgement, no criticism, not even intervention. Simply rest back into present-moment awareness.   It's easier to do it throughout the day, so you can notice the easier things, first. For me, there were (and still are) things like giving canned responses to people instead of fully listening to what they're saying, or becoming annoyed the way my one friend chews his food for the 500,000th time. These are little moments that have been with me for so long that the belief structure that created them has become part of the wallpaper. We just need to shine the light of presence on them so that we can see their movements.  If you make this a daily thing, you'll find that presence will also begin to show up at times like you describe, when you're with friends and the patterns are stronger. At first, you'll already be in the middle of the pattern when you bring presence to it. Eventually, that awareness will come earlier and earlier, and eventually you'll be present before the pattern is triggered.   In my own life, some of the strongest patterns are with family. In the last 7 months or so, I've seen that change a lot through this. I don't see my Dad everyday because he lives out of town, so I don't get to ""practice"" this noticing on our relationship very often. But just by doing it in everyday life, I've seen the improvement when I visit him where I don't fall into that reactive son role as often. The awareness of those patterns is just there before they get a chance to arise. Instead of stopping it, I—or presence—was there before it happened.  The same is true for my friends. I have one friend in particular that I hang out with pretty regularly, and it has been fascinating to see how all of those old patterns (and I have plenty with him) are slowly dissolving.  Above all, know that this is happening already, or you wouldn't even be asking about it."

Our brain puts those things we have learned into categories, because that's how human brains work, by comparison. It records, categorizes and filters all new information through the previous ""truths"" we are taught. This is the ego forming, automatically processing information through previous information accepted as truth. As a child, we are still growing and learning and we trust what we are told. Independent thought isn't the focal point because there are so many other things that are being taught to us, and so many other factors of life that are more important (communication, relationship building, emotional control, hormones). We attempt to ""know"" ourselves as teenagers, but many people struggle to see past the labels and stereotypes that have been laid out, not to mention the sudden changes that are happening in the body which create strange and unpredictable emotions and bring to mind new ""truths"" that will change next week.     Fast forward to being an adult, and your brain has finally fully developed and has the capacity to process true ""knowing"". Finally, our body can function in such a way to perform optimally. But oh, there's that pesky ego in the way, filtering everything through a predetermined set of truths. Some people have already learned to think ""outside the box"", or outside the ego, and can forge their way quickly to true ""knowing"". But many of us were not raised or trained to do so, and it isn't always instinctive anymore after years and years of accepting outside knowledge. It can be very difficult to break free from that because of emotional ties to these truths. You see it especially in those raised in religious homes or in some kind of prejudiced environment where you are taught that your thoughts and beliefs will condemn you in some way should they differ from those around you.     So, in short, I think that during our physical development, our ego is built by outside forces (parents, teachers, friends, life experiences, media) and internal, yet potentially unstable and fallible sources (emotions, hormonal changes, mental illness). Once our body (brain) is fully developed, we must work past, through, and with this ego in order to know ourselves."

I think true understanding isn't an achievement or a goal to reach, it's the glimpses of truth we catch along the way. Sacred moments along your path that give you a nugget of good, solid knowledge. It's a stone along the road as you journey to the temple of knowledge. Solid, concrete, and sturdy. It holds up against the ruckus that runs down the path. Pick up the stone and take it with you, because when you reach the temple you'll find that it is just a plot of land, and the only supplies you have are the stones you have gathered. And so you will build your own temple of knowledge, stone by stone, one trek at a time, and only when you lay to your final rest will the temple be created.     What is knowledge? What is understanding? It is only what we perceive it to be. It is only the reality you create.      The journey isn't fleeting or hopeless, for each and every day you could find a stone of truth and understand that will help build your temple. Keep your eyes open, take advantage of this time of health. Teach yourself to instinctively recognize the stones so when you are old and tired and your mind becomes addled, every atom in your body leaps to attention when you happen upon one. Treasure them. Worship them. They are your goal, and they are all around you."

awakened,3dcgoa,scomberscombrus,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"No particular foods, but a few guidelines are followed.  I am not directly involved with food production, most of us aren't, but I try to eat what I could see myself producing. So mostly plants, fish, and shellfish; Gardening is a wholesome activity, and fishing can be very relaxing. I do neither regularly, but I wouldn't resist doing so. A bit of dairy at times, perhaps an egg if the situation arises.  I find myself going for foods with labels and certifications that point toward some sort of sustainable agricultural practice.  The woods are filled with berries right now, and soon mushrooms. So that's a regular part of the diet at this moment.  Looking at it a bit deeper, we can see that everything we do involves death, and life. All actions as soon as they are pointed out carry elements of creation and destruction. Trying to distance ourselves from one aspect is like trying to eliminate the right end of the stick by chopping away at it. There'll always be the two ends of the stick. So use the stick for this or that, but try to avoid hitting people with it.  Look deeply into what you consume. See the water, the soil, the sunlight, the human (and animal) work and effort that brought you this bite of food. Know that your consumption of it is a part of that whole. If you consume the fruits of suffering, then that suffering becomes a seed in the soil of your person.  (Suffering in that sense does not necessarily refer to pain itself, or to the act of destruction, but to the needless involvement of beings that react with horror to their situation. Their reaction may be in part due to their perspective, but also due to unwholesome practices like overconsumption and excessive force.)  See the world as your own body. It is often said that the rainforests are the lungs of the Earth, but it's just as much your lungs. There is no separation between that rainforest, the atmosphere, the wind, your lungs, and the bodily process of breathing. It's one process, one system. Treat is as such, or at least look at it that way. If you look at it that way many of the appropriate actions will do themselves.    A person named Michael Pollan has done a great deal of good writing and talking about food. I'd recommend information related to his works The Omnivore's Dilemma as well as In Defense of Food to anyone who enjoys such things; He has held quite a number of lectures over the years.   Oh! And do not forget The Botany of Desire, there is a book, a documentary, as well as lectures on it. It beautifully recognizes the interdependence of the human and its environment. It also takes a rather amusing plant-perspective, asking if perhaps the plants we choose to cultivate are in fact using us for their own benefit. I guess in reality it's both and neither. It's completely a matter of perspective, as the whole of it is very much the ouroboros consuming itself for its own benefit; The human-perspective and the plant-perspective are both perspectives of separation, but looking at a different perspective can be useful to those stuck in one or the other!  Also Thich Nhat Hanh as authored a short and simple How To Eat that is quite loving in its message."

This hyper-real, detached moment when all of the worldly things just slip away, and you will have presence and understanding. You will know it when you have it. (Are it?). After that moment it slips away, but it's ok because you have had it, and it's enough to sustain for like... ever. But you also will come to understand how to get there.   But here's the really weird and honestly kind of annoying bit. You really can't get there if you are trying to get there. You know how you lift weights so that your body becomes stronger, and when you are done lifting weights, all other effort is that much easier? This is what you are doing. Exercise your mind, not because the moment comes when you are looking for it, but because you want to be prepared when it does.   The moment comes to all of us, many times. We ignore it. The secret is not attaining it, but recognizing it unconsciously when it does, and seizing it without effort. It is like correcting yourself when you ride a bicycle. You don't even think about it. You just ARE the thing. At first you will notice it after the fact ""Was that it? Was I doing it??"" Yeah, you probably were.  So don't totally neglect your material life. Continue to live in the joy of friendship, and pay your bills, play your games and watch your shows. After all you need to rest your mind as well! But do not be attached to these things. Be ready to drop them at a moment's notice, forever. There is no treasure on earth which is as great as The Big Mystical True Something or Other.  Once you experience it, and you will know it when you do, you will look back at all you've ever learned done and experienced and realized why it happened, as though your life pointed at this moment. With time you will understand why. It is because you have accessed a deep truth, and truth describes what is.  You will struggle to explain it and you can't. Don't worry, you know. That's enough. You will look back at all the psychadelic mumbo jumbo bullshit and realize how true some of the little axioms have been the whole time. ""Love is the answer"" ""Empty your mind"" ""Be like a mirror"" ""Flow down the river"". I don't even need to tell you this part. I just hope when you get there you remember me and laugh that laugh of real joy. You'll say ""Oh man... that guy on the internet told me this would happen""  And that's one of the big key secrets.

It doesn't play for any end other than the act itself.  Regarding the assumptions mentioned, are they not both simply the assumption of fundamental separation between a this and a that, a self and an other or not-self?  ""God created all the things, and the things and God are all separate from myself.""  ""The universe of nature exists outside of myself, and I am a foreign explorer of it.""  These beliefs crumble when the nature of the believer is looked at with fearless honesty.  One does not know how these legs move as the body walks, neither does one know how the eyes shift their focus. Just as little does one know about the flow of blood, or the hormonal activities of the body.   We can see the body, we can see the legs, the eyes, the blood, and we can investigate what we label hormones. We can also investigate labels such as wind and sunlight, and at the beginning and end of it all we know just as little about their origins.   We find that we share this ineffable origin with all the labels, how come? Because we are the I doing it all. But it's not being done in the sense of forceful control that we normally think of as doing, but in the spontaneous way of non-doing (as in the daoist idea of wei wu wei.)  All the things we can investigate, including our emotional states, and the contents of our sensory perceptions, all flow from this single source. It is unknown, because knowing too flows from it.  We perceive, and we think that what we perceive is a puzzle. We think that there must be a problem. And as soon as we create the problem, we create the search for the solution.  Why is it silly? Well. When we look, we perceive. What do we perceive?  Perceptual awareness is much like the graphical user interface on a computer. Awareness is our very nature, we are all individual perspectives of awareness streaming from the One source.  Investigating the contents of perceptual awareness using precisely that very perceptual awareness is like riding your horse in search of your horse. It's like trying to bite your own teeth. It's like trying to investigate the code using the graphical user interface alone.  Do it, or don't. Awakening is awakening to the fact that you can absolutely do it, but that you do not have to do it. A child does not have to play, but it does. You do not have to live, but you do. Trying to solve life is just the symptom of feeling like we have to live. And so it appears to be a problem."

Many spiritually inclined people are also empaths.  It can be challenging, since empaths are also often highly sensitive, but also an asset.  Many empaths go into the helping professions - medicine, therapy, social work, etc.  As far as people correcting for using ""I, you, etc"", at least from a Buddhist perspective, this is silly.  From a Buddhist perspective, Anatta - or ""no-self"" means that there is no permanent self that does not change moment to moment, and that there is nothing intrinsic or solid and lasting for this self.  It does not mean that there isn't something to the common human conceptual view of being a separate person who sees, feels, thinks, smells.  But it means that this is just a view, among many different views one can have, and that this view is not ""real"" in the sense that it is not permanent, lasting, or intrinsic.

Saying that there no 'I' is a, perhaps clumsy, way of trying to point out this perspective to one who does not share it.  A wave is an arbitrarily selected part of the pattern-ing of the whole ocean, it is an interdependent form of change in the changeless. That wave is there. The wave that is not there is the supposedly independent and water-less wave entity.

In the West we're all hands-off about it.  We study it in a sterile kind of way, and don't fuck with it.  Western mentality is to stand apart from whatever you're trying to study without becoming involved in it.  In fact becoming personally involved with what you're studying is known as ""going native"" in anthropology, and whether or not this is a good thing is not a settled issue.  Western philosophy has a lot of bright minds, and yes, someone with imagination can use those ideas for spirituality, but not directly.  Camus is not directly useful.  Husserl is not directly useful.  Etc.  They're off to the side somewhat, and very neutral, disinterested.  Plus, the readability of lots of these people is just absolutely terrible.  Ever tried reading Derrida?  It's more fun to get a lobotomy.  It's like reading Marx.  It's terrible.  Have you tried reading Buddhist Suttas, Daodejing, Zhuangzi?   Those are all very eminently readable and often laconic texts that don't waste words, don't bloviate, but get straight to the point.  Western philosophers love to bloviate for hundreds of pages when something can be said in 20 pages of simple and clear prose.  Why?  Because Western philo is structured around academic acceptance and commercial success, and 20 pages is not a ""serious"" book academically or commercially.  Whereas Laozi or Zhuangzi didn't give the slighest of fucks how many pages it would take.  You can argue the Buddhist canon is huge, but it all comes in tiny bite-sized chunks.  Each sutta can be read as a stand-alone text, and they're absolutely eminently readable.  They're not convoluted.  They don't use wacky prose.  But there are of course problems too.  Buddhist texts are laden with an absurd amount of jargon, on par with Western philo, which also loves to invent new terms.  So I have some respect for Western philo, and I agree that many names you list resonate when I watch cliff notes videos about them, but actually trying to read Derrida's books first-hand proved to me that it's a waste of my time.  Watching a 10 min video on Derrida tells me that I agree with the man, and I don't need his help to think about ideas I knew about since birth: everything is contextual.  I don't need Derrida to tell me about it.  I knew it myself.  So I agree, yes, but I don't need it.  Tell me how many western philosophers were yogis?  Maybe Socrates.  Anyone since then?

Actions are taken and interests pursued in Western tradition, despite my reluctance to broadly pigeonhole what you have labelled as Western versus Eastern. Philosophy is simply not in a good position to circumvent considerations of action, regardless of tradition. This is at the crux of what the philosophers the OP mentioned in regards to subjective experience explicitly studied or wrote about. Western philosophy can be succinct or verbose, but it is extremely misleading to compare writing styles across epochs. Can you give me examples of contemporary eastern philosophy journals that have more succinct articles than Analysis?   Also, I should add that your reading of Husserl is somewhat off. He is both interested and useful (and awesome). Derrida also gets a bad rap, although he is long-winded. Neither is a waste of time, unless you aren't getting anything out of it, in which case it is, of course.

From the POV of awakening it's sheer ignorance.  But when the Western people say something mildly enlightened about mind, such as the case with Wittgenstein, Camus, Neitzsche, Deridda, Heidegger, Berkeley and probably above all Husserl (Husserl is probably the best and most relevant if you want to understand your own mind), they always take a role of an observer.  They don't give you exercises to transform perceptions.  They don't present you with an amazing teleology, like how to train your mind to enter a heavenly realm here and now, or how to escape all suffering in a practical way, etc.  Buddha was different in that he handed out plenty of philosophical thought and practical exercise, both.  So there was contemplation and meditation, and not just contemplation alone.  Buddha also taught people how to perform magickal transformations (four bases of power).  None of the Western philosophers talk about magickal transformations that I am aware of.  Westerners are tainted by belief in objectivity.  Even people who question objectivity, like say Derrida, they don't know what to do about it.  All they can do is sit back and question things and write thick dense books about it.

What you thought you knew about Western philosophy becomes almost completely inverted. Kant seems less a moralist and more a verbose sage, and the pre-Socratics' seemingly primitive insights hold more water than a thousand books of contemporary analytic philosophy. Much of the history of the discipline has just been aimed at disillusioning Westerners with language, thus philosophers in this direction (e.g., Wittgenstein, the pragmatists) are largely right, but the side of philosophy which holds truth as ""contingent"" is still viewing reality from a relative frame of reference without impinging on the absolute. Western philosophy has never really integrated the phenomenal and the noumenal in a coherent way, since it can't be done by means of a formal/rigorous argument. It has to be done by the individual in his/her own experience. The modern existentialists, even though there is incredible depth to the rest of the lineage, get something very wrong (in my view): they assert existence precedes essence. I do think, though, that figures like Kierkegaard and Martin Buber were right on the cusp. Buber, I think, was definitely enlightened. Have you ever read I and Thou?  As to whether there have been ""awakened"" Western thinkers, though, there have been countless -- most of whom aren't philosophers, I'd wager. I'd say the majority are great bards and poets. It's very evident in their writing... Whitman, Pessoa, and Rilke are three of my favorites (I'm actually less well-read in this arena than I want to be). Shakespeare astonishes me with his insights... Samuel Beckett's quietism is also somewhere along the path toward awakening. His first line of Waiting for Godot, ""No-thing to be done,"" always sticks with me. In that play you'll see a rehearsal of birth and death, rebirth, longing for truth, surrender -- it's magnificent. Same goes for Hamlet.  In short, once the spirit of enlightenment overtakes you, you see it everywhere. The West has incredibly rich varieties of it, without explicitly talking about what it is. Our arts are infused to the brim with that spirit. You'd have to be completely blind (or deprived) not to see the richness of Western thought throughout history. Today we're impoverished by comparison. Today we worship mere commentary. As to whether it'll guide anyone on the path toward enlightenment, though, no. That is India's innovation."

Surrender any idea of free will, deservedness, and especially any expectation of what you're going to ""get"" (phenomenally and from the spiritual journey) - ever again. The sooner, the better.  The things you think you're still supposed to do or be in order to be an enlightened being, they're junk. No one knows what an enlightened being is and does, except you, and not even you. You don't even know.   Just because you feel confused sometimes, or resistance sometimes, or interested in the mind sometimes doesn't mean you've failed or you've done something wrong. Death throes. It all disappears eventually.   Do I just need to be patient and allow this to unfold as it will?   Yes. But you allow it to unfold as it will by engaging with it as you're guided. Meditate when it's obviously time to meditate. Inquire when it's obviously time to inquire. Yoga when it's obviously time to move.   Not a second sooner and not a second later. Let it (the process) do you.  You don't need my guidance. You don't need anyone's guidance. You have everything you need, and then some. You're being honest with yourself; that's your golden ticket.   These are just some things I feel like, had someone said them to me, would have made it easier."

It only happens when you let go. Seeking through one of those practices doesn't lead there. I'm sure you've heard this before. Doing those practices every day trying to reach that goal is what leads to frustration.   I feel it's just going with the flow. The true flow of who you are in the deepest sense.  You'll see through yourself and your ego, which I believe you're already doing. That's great, cause knowing yourself is a key element. People who lie to themselves still get ruffled very easily due to the lack of mindfulness practice. They're still trapped in their ego self. You're well on your way.   I think you do have all the drive and curiosity to get there. I also believe you're right... It's just got to come to you at this point. I think woo-woo has summed it up really well. Good job!  Wow, this really is why it can't be described. This sucks. It's the finger pointing at the moon!  Those Buddhists weren't joking. Until you try to put it into words or try to describe the process, it's ridiculous. You just have to give up to the universe, cause you are the universe and not your body.  Surrender like woo-woo says. It sounds messed up cause how does that work right, but that's exactly it!  You can't force it by taking an action, like you can't force yourself to sleep. You simply stop trying to sleep then you can sleep.  Sleep happens on is own, not when forced.   Enlightenment is your true nature, so you relax into your being.

Regarding the practice, I'll keep an eye out for any ""forced"" practice.  I can feel when this is happening.  The best sitting meditations are the ones where the mood just hits me and I sit and watch the breath and the mind.    Everything including the thoughts of ""how long have I been sitting?""  It's just the mind rambling on. It doesn't matter how long... just sit until it is done.  I'm also learning not to cling to the feeling of peace that is now dominant.  When there is a moment of disturbance, I need to allow it to be and not desire to immediately return to the peace.  The other day I called the Netflix support line due to an issue with the service and noticed an annoyance at the background noise of the support center (all the voices talking and someone playing music at their desk).  That is when I noticed I was clinging to the peace... desiring the peace.   I am not the annoyance or the peace.  They are just mental formations that arise and pass.  The annoyance was caused by a desire for an ideal conversation with the support guy.  It really is all about letting go.  Accept what is.  Surrender."

awakened,3clrku,Signalgod,6,Thu Jul 9 03:37:38 2015 UTC,"One could perhaps view the spontaneous death of the ego as the death of one particular perspective. It's like if we look at this representation of a cube: Someone (a child) who has never seen such a figure may be completely absorbed by the actual cube that seems to exist right there. Then suddenly, the cube shifts, and it suddenly points in a different direction. What's up with that? What happened to the old cube? Well I guess we have a new cube? No wait, it shifted again! What?  Now the death of the cube occurs with the realization that it is not the cube that undergoes any change, but that our perception of the black lines is a fluid and uncertain process. The perception of a cube may still arise in awareness, but it will always be recognized as not really a cube. Then one might get stuck in calling it just a bunch of lines, but that's a different story. If one sees beyond the cube, one may see lines, but what of seeing beyond the lines? Is there any beyond the beyond? That's the whole game of seeking. There's no cube; There are no lines, but there's also no need to go any further; There's no no-cube. If the cube is a whirlpool, then the lines may be what the whirlpool looks like underneath the surface. But it is in the state of complete relaxation that we float up to the surface and recognize that we've always been (in) the water, and we'll always be (in) the water no matter how deep we dive. If we find that diving and swimming against the current leads to stress, then we recognize the possibility of floating!  So when floating we no longer need to construct for ourselves a narrative that tells the story of how the cube came to point in this or that direction. We no longer need to defend our perspective. ""You're saying the cube points this way? No! I say it points that way!"" What does it even mean to say that it points this way or that way? What points?   And so there is silence. Like when looking at nature fills you with a silent awe that is unrelated to the perception of beauty (as opposed to ugly). You may think ""Ah!"", and you may even say something out loud. You may label it beautiful, but there is one component of it all that does not register the existence of contrasting labels.  One way of pointing toward it may be to say that it is the state of absolutely no fear. When you look at a tree and the tree becomes a mirror in the realest sense. Terms like birth and death lose their meaning; One recognizes change, but one identifies with the changeless (and the whole process of change, not this one arbitrarily selected part of the pattern).  Maybe."

We get confused and afraid and forget that we are not our egos. Since its purpose is survival, it reinforces itself however possible, and it tries to deny us access to any feelings, intuition, thoughts, information, knowledge, or understanding which may threaten its stability. It is associated with the artificial identities we construct for ourselves and present to others, and is necessary for communication and normal participation in modern life.  But if you think that is all you are you tend to get drawn into suffering easily when our life circumstances don't satisfy the ego's desires.

We're still stuck in our animal skin, our biological bodies that seem to desire many of the same things our ego desires. Maybe our bodies can survive without the ego...but what's so awakened or spiritual about that? Does transcending the ego truly lead to an awareness that we are eternal or spiritual beings?"
awakened,3clrku,sovereign_self,3,Thu Jul 9 03:11:39 2015 UTC,"We're still stuck in our animal skin, our biological bodies that seem to desire many of the same things our ego desires.    When you're not wrapped up in the ego, whether it's the human ego or the spiritual one, there's no sense of ""trapped."" It's a joy having this body, a tool, with which to celebrate and experience the celebration of life. And even then, it doesn't even feel like your body. It feels like part of a larger body of oneness that's in experience. I'm no more trapped in my body as I am trapped in this room or trapped in this country or trapped in this planet or trapped in this universe.  Moreover, the body doesn't ""desire"" anything, in my experience. It's not sentient in that way. Would you say your car wants gas? Or your vacuum cleaner wants to be emptied? It's the same with the body. Unfortunately, we confuse chemical changes as our desires or moods or whatever (because that's what the ego does, it claims and confuses everything in its experience as its own special separate self's); they're not that. At best, they're like warning lights that come on in the indication panel of your car. But by living egoically, instead of, say, putting oil in your tank when the light comes on, you fill it to overflowing on a daily basis even though the light is no longer on (but you still remember the day when you were 13 and the light was on, so you'd better fill it again), burn out the engine, and then convince yourself that the real issue was that the tire needed changed and there's something wrong with the panel.   Does transcending the ego truly lead to an awareness that we are eternal or spiritual beings?   Yes. It's hard to believe (and I wouldn't want you to just believe it, but find it yourself), because it's impossible to see what's not immediately available in your current experience. It turns out to be not that big of a deal, though, because it is your natural state.  It is.  It's like you're standing in front of a very, very, very muddy window, and on the other side of the window is a magnificent seascape, but you've never seen the seascape, only mud, so you're all, ""I don't believe that there's a beautiful sea scape out there at all. All I've ever known is this mud. And I particularly like these few swirls and smudges right here, so I don't think I should clean it off.""  But when you clean off the window, there it is! And it's amazing and more perfect than you could have ever dreamed.  But to take this clumsy metaphor and run it into the ground a bit more, what you actually realize is that you were the one who put the mud there in the first place; you've always had the ability to clean it off; and, even more amazingly, the mud, the seascape, everything - it was always inside you.  So, anyway, to answer your question as to why one might want to remove themselves from the fiction of the ego story: Would you rather look at mud or look at a seascape? If you're 100% happy looking at mud and not even curious about the sea, then there's no reason. Just depends on how much you want to know the truth about the view, really."

awakened,3clrku,Redfo,2,Thu Jul 9 07:12:39 2015 UTC,"Think of a flashlight. The flashlight has a lens (or a reflector) to focus the light in a specific area. The ego is the lens for the the light of awareness to focus it into human experience. A tool. The illusion is that we believe that we are only the ego—the lens—when we are, in fact the entirety of the light.   Once we get that sorted out (with direct experience, not simply by thinking about it), the ego and body-mind are still used, but seen and felt in their proper respect to the source from which they are manifest. The best way that I know of to see this is just to pause and notice that every thought, feeling, sensation of the body, and sense perception is known—something is aware of it, including that sense of personal ego self. There is an awareness that can't be pointed to, which is aware of the sense of personal self. That means that this awareness must be prior to those thoughts and feelings in some way. You can't see without your eyes—they must exist prior to seeing. Likewise, you cannot know your experience and your personal self without this awareness.   So when you ask, ""Who is this that you speak of?"", one answer may be ""The ego, in service to the greater conscious awareness of which it is a part,"" because on the human level, we must use the ego lens to focus the light and communicate in language. But ultimately, like u/veragood's whirlpool answer, the ego is also a part of this awareness, whether it knows it or not. So the penultimate answer is that ""you"" or ""I"" is the the infinite mysterious vast knowing aware nothingness, which is interchangably pointed to with the words Absolute, Awareness, That, Self-capital-ess, etc."

But let's see if any of my intellectualizing can bring clarity:   What is so special about it?    Nothing in particular. What seems special is the 'aha' moment of recognizing that we've been overlooking it all this time, and it's our essential nature. It also begins to change our priorities, as we recognize that many of our fears are unfounded, including death.   What is so spiritual about it?    This depends on your definition of spiritual. I've come to see spirituality as an adjustment of fundamental assumptions about life. Once that adjustment period is over, then there's no need to have a separate idea called spirituality.   Why are we even calling it and it?    Most languages are modeled after the apparent physical world of objects. To use language, we must abstract what we're speaking of into concepts, then label those concepts as objects. 'It' refers to the conceptual abstraction that we've labelled 'awareness', which itself refers to a direct experience that cannot be truly abstracted.  /tangent   Really, this is true of anything we refer to. It seems we can say that a tree is clearly an object with defined boundaries. So tree must mean tree. But why are air and soil considered outside the boundaries of 'tree'? The boundary itself is a concept! Where in our direct experience of a tree is the boundary that says that it is a thing in itself?  /end tangent   Is it not just self-consciousness?

So, for me, it’s an experience. And something happens when this experience occurs that is unexplainable. It doesn’t feel like a belief. It doesn’t feel like it’s a concept that I’m having to hold onto. It doesn’t feel like I need proof.  It’s like if I asked you if you had a hand, and you could say ‘yes’, because you feel it, you see it, you can move it, etc. For me to say consciousness comes before the brain is that clear. That’s the only way I could say it.  Until science can measure subjective experiences, I can’t prove this to you. I can only encourage you to keep noticing for yourself.  I think that what helped me was to really sit and notice how anything we think that we know about the world is fed to us through our senses, which means every sensory perception is appearing in the mind. Light enters our eyes, it's processed and then we experience this visual projection in front of us. Nerves fire all over our body, it's processed and then we get this mentally constructed sensation of a body. We never interact with anything but mind. No one has ever had an experience of their brain—or anyone else’s—that wasn’t a mental experience.  The feeling of balance and weight of my body, its temperature and comfort level, the computer in front of me, the shape and appearance of my hands, the sound of rain hitting the windows, the taste of coffee in my mouth… all of these are projections created from cellular communication to the brain and interpreted by the mind into a projection of reality.  Now, that in itself doesn’t prove that consciousness is first, because you could argue that while it is so that all experience of the physical world through the senses is a mental construct, it’s the brain that assembles them into this projection. And you would not be wrong, except that in my experience, that’s not the end game. Because consciousness, to me, is primary to matter, and what we’re seeing here is a physical manifestation of human mind as brain, not brain creating mind.   It’s like the physical world and the waking state are a very persistent dream. It’s so “solidified” that it becomes a continuous experience. But it’s still a dream. It’s the dream. Just as in a dream, your body is not really solid, but you believe it is until you wake up and see that it was illusory, or become lucid in the dream. Awakening is like becoming lucid in the waking state. And that lucidity is really seeing for yourself how it’s all mind. All consciousness."

It's funny, you are having trouble seeing what is spiritual about all this. But for me, after a few years of practice I see absolutely everything as spiritual. Every experience is a manifestation of the natural law of the universe. Evey moment is a sacred opportunity to grow and connect with ""source"".  I guess it's a matter of perspective, and the meanings we all attach to things."

If we say everything is spiritual it becomes a hollow word right? It's like pantheist's saying everything is God, what does it really lead to?    Every experience is a manifestation of the natural law of the universe   Sure, again this doesn't have to be spiritual. Our bodies along with our consciousness still decompose and rot away. Our egos were a construct and thus never live nor die but what does that leave us with...why spirituality? Is it not just another religious farce to believe there's another life after this, that there's something that's more than meets the eye?"
awakened,3clrku,Redfo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"If we say everything is spiritual it becomes a hollow word right?   A few things. 1) Yes, I suppose that's right but if you are actually living it, it can make for a very rich experience and joyful life. 2) All words are hollow anyway. All phenomena are hollow, in a sense.   When say spiritual I suppose I mean ""of or relating to the human spirit, the intangible or non-material aspects of life, or the transformation of consciousness"".  And I know (not believe, know) that the the spiritual and material arise from the same root and are mutually interdependent, and inseparable. Our experience of being alive relies upon both aspects equally.  Physical things affect our spiritual health and our spiritual health affects our physical life.  In being aware of my own life, and attempting to learn and grow and heal my traumas, I have noticed that we all attach meaning to phenomena that isn't inherent in the phenomena itself, but arises in our ego as a reaction to some perceived threat. People are unaware of the process, but are heavily influenced nonetheless by the artificial meaning they attribute to their experience. This meaning is defined not by the inherent nature of the phenomena itself, but by the beliefs we hold about it, these beliefs are often subconscious and may go against the beliefs we consciously promote.. So knowing this, I realized that every experience has these artificial meanings and beliefs tied to it. I saw that every thought that went through my head is bullshit! A rationalization to justify my stupid ego desires.  So every moment becomes an opportunity to call bullshit on myself and peel back the layers to try to see the truth of the situation.  This is what the whole idea of ""living in the present moment"" is about. It's about seeing what is actually happening beyond the mental filters we tend to put over every experience. Setting aside the ego's bullshit and actually seeing the truth allows us to make decisions that may actually lead to true happiness rather than fleeting pleasures.  So yeah, everything is spiritual. We are not physical beings having spiritual experiences, we are spiritual beings having physical experiences, all that mumbo jumbo is pretty much true.  Spirituality is not about living to worship something outside of yourself, it's about seeing the truth inside yourself."

But, it's my belief based on rigorous meditation practice that there is a part of this experiential process that is eternal, deathless, beyond space and time. It's not an identity, and not a 'thing', but just the pure essence of being itself. So, I try my best, in this life, to live from the perspective of the pure essence of awareness.

awakened,3clrku,sovereign_self,3,Thu Jul 9 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"what is so special/mystical/spiritual about pure awareness?   Nothing! That's kind of the whole point! Yet very few people seem to be able to notice it. Even those who notice it have a hard time being in touch with it all the time. The 'special part' is, pure awareness can't be touched, can't be tainted, can't be hurt or insulted, it can't suffer. It's just awareness.   Why do we call it awakening when one reaches this state?   When the Buddha was asked about his enlightenment, what he had discovered, he simply replied, 'I am awake'. He meant, there was no special thing going on, no contact with some supposed god, he was just no longer in the 'dream' of false identity. The feeling of being in a state of pure awareness does feel like awakeness, relative to the ordinary state of human culture of being wrapped up in divisive thought.   Now your just a self-conscious animal that still dies. That pure awareness doesn't last forever does it?   Different schools of thought have different opinions on this, but it seems to many as though the awareness actually precedes mind. It's not contained within the body, the body and mind and all things appear within it. It's empty space, pure emptiness, aware but not thinking, not doing, just watching. That may seem like religious or mystical thinking, unprovable, and in a sense it is, but that is the experiential feeling of it, like you've remembered what you were before you were born. Regardless of if that's true or not, being able to stay within unconditioned awareness in your life has major benefits to your ability to be compassionate, your inability to really suffer, and seems to eliminate the fear of death."

I can dig this, it does seem as many people and religions come to this conclusion.   but it seems to many as though the awareness actually precedes mind   ""seems"". Also, so what if awareness doesn't precede mind and brain? Does that take away from the experience? Why does awareness have to precede it?  also you even say yourself that;   That may seem like religious or mystical thinking, unprovable, and in a sense it is, but that is the experiential feeling of it  experiential feeling of it   That is the key thing.

awakened,3clrku,sarvaga,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Of course it's ok! It doesn't really matter inevitably. When you reach a completely unconditioned state of consciousness, whatever that feels like lies outside thought, since thought is conditioned, no thought occurs in that state. So you just have to trust the feeling, no matter if you think it's god, pure awareness, just the brain turning off, whatever, who cares. That's just mind stuff happening after the fact. What does matter is the compassion, lack of suffering, lack of fear of death. However you experience that, who cares, peace is peace.  When someone is enlightened, it doesn't mean they suddenly get all the answers. It just means the questions cease. There's no point creating meaning in something that's ultimately meaningless. So the question of whether it's god or brain doesn't really need to be asked."

Like a fractal, the life of each being is a perfect reflection of the entirety of life itself. The full depth and beauty of the universe is contained within each living thing.  Transcending the ego certainly doesn't mean we become animals or passive meat bags or whatever you may be worried about. In my opinion the ego doesn't die or weaken so much as it transforms. You could look at it like this: the ego is an unruly part of yourself that has usurped control over your life like a tyrant general takes control over a nation. To become truly happy, one must realize that the ego has no real power or substance. You must realize the tyrant is manufacturing fear to justify his existence, and then you can become truly sovereign. And the (reformed) general serves in his proper place."

The gut feeling, the subtle little thing that pops into your mind immediately but is so often swatted down by second guessing thoughts. Some say our true knowing mind is in our gut. I think the gut feeling of knowing something is not really tied to the ego, and indeed, if you can put the ego in its proper place, you can get much more reliable access to your inherent all-knowing self.   And the feeling of pure bliss you get from spiritual practice, from confronting the darker parts of yourself with love, that is so much better than any sense pleasure you could imagine.

awakened,3cjlnj,dimmyMelly,3,Wed Jul 8 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that I haven’t watched the video yet, but when I leave work, I intend to do so. [Watched it, comments included.] I wanted to speak to your question from my own experience and my intuition about what you describe Krishnamurti as saying. I’ll then come back and add my comments about the video when I’ve seen it.  I’ll start with my understanding of awareness, concentration and attention. These may or may not jive with what Krishnamurti was saying, but we’ll see.  Awareness, for me, is being aware. The emphasis is on the word “being”, because it’s not something one does. We have a phrase “to be aware”, but that refers more to concentration, in my opinion. Awareness just happens. We don’t have to try to be aware of what we are aware of. It’s part of our essential nature.  Awareness is often contrasted to experience. There is experience, and we are aware of it. All body sensations, mind movements, sense perceptions—all this is experience. Awareness is just an empty knowingness of these things.  Attention, for me, is like an aperture to experience, or a frame. If awareness is camera film (or digital sensor in today’s world), then attention is the lens and the camera. We can have wide angle lenses and micro lenses and many in-between. We can shoot from different angles, lighting environments and distances. They all change the way the scene appears on the film, but the film itself does not change in order to modify the scene. [In actual photography, different films can affect different photo styles, but indulge me in this metaphor for a moment longer.]  Notice that the camera and the lens are both part of the environment surrounding the film. In the same way, if you could imagine an interface between awareness and experience, attention would be on the experience side, but right up against awareness. (Awareness isn’t a thing to be up against, but this is for logical relationship purposes.)  That’s how we can “change” our attention. It has to be on the experience side for it to move, because only experience gives the sense of moving and changing. Awareness simply knows what’s happening. Attention is a modification of experience to give it a certain framing or point-of-view.  When it comes to the movement of attention, you could imagine it having two directions, much like the zoom on a lens: tight and wide. We can tighten on any part of experience, or widen and take it all in. In the mind and body, this feels like tension and relaxation, respectively. When we meditate, in effect, we are widening our attention by relaxing more deeply than we normally do in our waking state, and so we notice more and more of what is.  Concentration, for me, has two versions, depending on the level of attention that is used. It is essentially the ability to keep the mind on a point of focus.    In the common definition, often used by college students cramming for exams, concentration is a use of attention to block out distractions and focus down on a task. The mind is still crazy and active, but it’s kept relatively (and poorly) caged through tense narrow-band attention.  In the definition used more by spiritual traditions, the ultimate aim, in my opinion, is to concentrate in a different way. Instead of caging the mind into a small tight ball of tense attention, we learn to train the mind to still itself upon an object of concentration, while at the same time, we widen our attention through relaxation. This is clearly illustrated in breathing meditation, where we sit relaxed and rest our mind on our nostrils or our navel. The gentle return to that point of focus retrains the mind so that concentration can occur through stillness, rather than through forced attention.  So, what Krishnamurti may be saying (again, without having yet seen the video) is that when we relax and widen our attention as full as we can, and our mind is more still, i.e., concentrated, then we notice more and more of the subtlety of what’s going on. And so, we can feel the impulses and movements within us right as they start, then choose to continue or stop. At times, our awareness is so wide and our concentration so still, that for certain things we don’t even have a response to them unless we choose to. You might notice in retrospect that you thought and felt nothing about a comment that might have sent you into a tailspin months before.   This is what he means about it not leaving a memory. The older parts of our brains evolved to sharply remember things that might be important to survival, like a grove of fruit trees or a place with lots of snakes. It determines that importance based on our level of excitement or fear. When our attention is open enough and our mind still enough, then we rest right at the root of our experience where we can act from clarity, calm and spontaneity, before some automatic pattern triggers emotions and unnecessary survival memories.  edit: I just watched the video and it was great! I think that if I were to map what Krishnamurti was saying to what I was saying, I would say that the way he used the word attention is what I meant by the word awareness. It's centerless, and you don't have to do it.   The way that he was using the word concentration, was what I was describing when I wrote about the common ""college student"" version of concentration."
awakened,3cjlnj,sovereign_self,2,Fri Jul 10 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"Beautifully said. Thank you so very much for taking the time to clarify things.  It definitely was Krishnamurthi's use of the word ""attention"" to describe what we know today as ""awareness"" what confused me. Guess awareness wasn't such a buzzword back when he started this whole thing :-)  Now, let me ask you a personal question...  When you find yourself being caught up on a train of useless/stray thoughts, what do you usually do?  A.) do you let the train of thought continue while being aware of what it's saying? B.) do you focus/narrow in on something that's present right now, like a sight, sound, body sensation, etc.? C.) do you do absolutely nothing and let the experience of now go straight to awareness? (probably the same as A) D.) something else?  Also, while we're caught up in (identified with) a thought, is that what Krishnamurthi means by ""the thinker has become the thought - observer is the observed - no separation between the two - is one""? Is this what's causing suffering? Is the way out of suffering to separate the observed from the observer? Is that achieved by simply ""being"" aware of whatever there is in the present moment (by removing all lenses and letting the light pass directly on to the sensor/film)?   Would love to hear your thoughts on this...  Cheers!"
awakened,3cjlnj,sovereign_self,2,Sat Jul 11 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"If I distill this down to make it a bit more manageable for myself, it seems that there are essentially two questions here:  When I’m caught in useless/stray thoughts, what do I do?  I suppose that my answer is a combination of your three propositions, depending on what feels most appropriate in the moment. First, I acknowledge that when I “notice” that I've been caught up in a train of thought, then I’m already out of that train of thought. So, in that sense, nothing need be done. If I focus on that train, which is now in the past, then I’m actually recalling it to the present and bringing it back. I tend only to do that if it seems like a reoccurring train that I’d like to explore to ask why am I so attracted to this particular train.  If I notice that I seem to be boarding every train that comes by, then I may take a few conscious breaths and become aware of the sensations immediately in my presence, including the body sensations, sense perceptions, emotions and mental imagery, without pushing anything away or judging any of it. I just remain aware of what’s here, no matter how uncomfortable, feeling into the parts that feel most identified. I think that one of the mistakes I used to make was to try and separate myself from the thought or feeling that I was “stuck” to. In fact, even knowing that, it still occurred (and sometimes still occurs) on a subtle level. That’s the very movement that maintains the identification. To dive fully into physical or emotional discomfort, or into a thought that is disturbing or unwelcome, is to recognize it for what it is and what it is not. Ignore-ance is how we stay stuck.  Similarly, I’ve been doing this with sweet thoughts; i.e., thoughts that I’m swept away in because of their positive attractive nature: flights of fancy, physical pleasures or ego gratification. These can be overlooked because they have a “good” quality. But if it creates more limited identification with past, future or other mental concepts, then it’s merely a gilded cage. That doesn’t mean that pleasurable things can’t be pleasurable, but simply that it’s only pleasurable in the moment that it occurs, and not longed for. It’s actually much more enjoyable that way.  What do I think is the cause of suffering in regard to thought?  ‘The thinker is the thought’, which Krishnamurthi was referring to, refers to the identification that occurs, in my experience. But it’s also very literal. Everything that is manifest has two sides: the form and the awareness of the form. The thought is self-aware, because it is a part of consciousness. Every thought has its own point of view. You can question it. You can go into it and see what it sees. When we are ‘identified’ with that thought, we adopt its point-of-view. We close down our attention upon it, and become it. We overlook other points of view. We forget/ignore the vastness of possibility that we are. So, yes, you could say that is suffering; believing that we’re in a limited point-of-view with no other possibility. Then, on top of that, not wanting things to be the way they are. So, if one is identified with a thought, the most freeing thing is not to want to be unidentified with the thought. To be OK with the worldview you are stuck in. Then on its own, tension drops and attention opens, revealing possibility once more.  edit: typos"

I'm sure many others will benefit from reading what you've written.  It is such an important point that we shouldn't use awareness/concentration to forcefully detach ourselves from negative thoughts/experiences with the intention of getting away from them. I still find myself doing that now and then in subtle ways as well. The thing that directs/controls awareness is still the ego isn't it?   Thank you again!
awakened,3cjlnj,sovereign_self,2,Tue Jul 14 12:02:46 2015 UTC,"That beauty that you see is the truth that you are reflected back to you. That’s what all beauty is. :)   The thing that directs/controls awareness is still the ego isn’t it?   Does ego control awareness? For me, that’s an unequivocal “no”, because awareness simply is. Ego appears inside awareness.  So then the question may become: does ego control anything? In my experience, no. Control is one of the fundamental illusions of ego. It’s what makes us come running back to it time and again. We think it’s keeping us safe. Like any thought, when we identify with the ego thought-form and adopt its point-of-view, we limit ourselves into believing that it is in control.   So, what is in control? You are. I am. That which is the same in us. The aware One. The mystery behind form. You may call this God or Goddess. Another may call it Infinity. It is described as the Absolute. But that is what is causing things. That is what we are.   The ego is an interface. It’s a tool for comprehension of the human experience. It’s a web of interrelated thoughts and belief structures that allow us to formulate words and interact in our cultures. It includes sets of habits that flavor the way that this particular body-mind acts in the world.  Why does the ego seem to control things sometimes? Why does it seem that personal me wants to pick up my cell phone to check my email, and it feels like personal me picks it up? Because in God’s dedication to its creation, it does not deny anything. It allows its own will to respond to the point-of-view that it is adopting. So, it’s like a feedback loop: God has adopted the limited human ego point-of-view. God-as-ego feels like a personal self that wants to pick up its cell phone. God’s will makes that happen in this corner of reality by maintaining the sense of identification with the body, the sense of thoughts as personal thoughts, and the cell phone as a separate object. But it was all still God. It was never ego. Ego is a mask. Ego is human-colored glasses.  In India, they call this Lila—The Divine Play. God puts on masks and plays many parts. It forgets itself—or a little more accurately, ignores or overlooks itself—and fully becomes that which it is experiencing. That’s not bad. That’s what it wanted to do. It’s what we wanted to do. Because, oh, how magnificent as we begin to take off the masks! To see the grand mystery that we are reflected to us in all these unique ways!   God knows itself through its creation."

It's as if I'm exploring and finding the borders, shape and size of this superego, or whatever it is.  There isn't a literal space that it exists in but more like the ""space"" of awareness.   After I ""popped out of the mind"" and looked back I started to notice so many things that are sitting in plain site but I never noticed before.

awakened,3cfnet,Destreich,7,Tue Jul 7 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"I've certainly experienced this, and it feels kind of exhausting and frustrating, because no matter where you go, it seems wrong on some level. Either the movement feels wrong, or the ""me who moves"" feels untrue.  Does ""doing this"" mean my ego is involved? But all is one, so does it even matter? But clearly, I'm not happy when I follow the ego, so shouldn't I work to get rid of it?  But who is working to get rid of what?  It's a crazy knot. Here's the secret—all of this thinking is the personal self trying to grasp things intellectually. It cannot grasp this fully, because it is inside the system. There is nothing for it to grasp.   Don't be so concerned about the truth of the personal self. One of the biggest things that helped me settle into this is realizing that just because the personal self is an illusion, that doesn't mean that it should be denied or rejected. That's an illusion, too. Nothing that is can be denied or rejected, and your bundle of thoughts and feelings that feels like it's a separate entity may be the truest experience for you in this moment.  So, the key is to let go, to relax, relax, relax, back into the seat of Self. Be instead of thinking about. It's only when we're completely at ease with what is—even if what is is dis-ease—that the paradox resolves. But the moment we try to conceptualize and intellectualize what we directly experience, or reject an experience because we ""know better"", then this knot occurs.   Love your frustration. Love your oneness. Love your separateness. Love your bliss. Let every moment flow through you freely, even when it doesn't. :)"

awakened,3cfnet,sovereign_self,2,Wed Jul 8 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"Should i continue self inquiry or is that just using my mind?   I try not to speak in “should” and “shouldn’t”, because there’s no universal way. What I can suggest is that if you feel there’s more to question, then question that. And when you ask a question, don’t expect or look for an answer. Just rest in the question-ness of the question; in that open-ended asking when the question is posed.  Adyashanti describes it like this: sit and relax as the awareness of all you are experiencing. Don’t try to stop thoughts or feelings, but simply be the awareness of them. After you’ve relaxed for a while, imagine that you are like a vast, deep, calm lake. Pose a question to yourself: “Who am I?” or you can ask “What am I?” or “What is awareness?” or “What is stillness?” Pick one that resonates for you.   Let this question be like a stone that you just gently drop into yourself as this deep lake. Let the question sink into the depths, and just rest there. Let anything that seems like a definitive answer arise and float away without grasping it or deciding that that’s it. Just rest in the openness of the question."

The ego is exhausting itself with a will toward awakening, not recognizing its own limitation and not realizing (since it can't realize anything) the separate self is not the one that is ""awakening."" You're exactly right that these stories are just more avoidance strategies. We progressively reposition ourselves in order to be entirely sure whether we're ready to let go or not. We're being gently weened off desires with new superego manifestations, and if we stay on the path, each time the milk will be soured. Others build homes out of their spiritual superegos and stay there the rest of their lives, making no apparent progress. The dark night is a boon and a result of how in tune you are with your suffering, confusion, and so on."

To be free you must be creating your thoughts right?  To be shown I'm just a puppet.  Don't confuse what you want to believe and what is testable and easily found out on your part.

Very much like how people would see Bruce Lee. He wasn't doing martial arts, he became it. He was the fullest expression of himself which lead to his inexplicable capabilities. Your actions are not swayed by society, friends, family etc. When you act, it is who you really are in your truest form. No need for acknowledgement or praise... not the subject of your own judgement. Greed or wants disappear and every action is towards the betterment of the collective. It's awesome.

The more complicated and restricted the method, the less the opportunity for expression of one's original sense of freedom. Though they play an important role in the early stage, the techniques should not be too mechanical, complex or restrictive. If we cling blindly to them, we shall eventually become bound by their limitations. Remember, you are expressing the techniques and not doing the techniques.

Especially when it comes to discussing ideas like free will, and not being in control of thoughts, etc. If you're speaking with someone who is unfamiliar with these sorts of philosophical discussions, one is likely to encounter a lot of resistance, as Rupert mentions in the video, there's this natural sort of distaste for curtailing of sense of personal freedom.  The reason I've continued to fill most of my days immersed in nonduality literature and conversation, is because along with offering guidance and insight in the post-awakening unfolding, it brings the discovery of new and lucid ways of describing difficult concepts.   If you notice how Rupert Spira and other teachers answer questions, they pause and really carefully choose their words. They also wait patiently for the person to really get out every idea before they respond. These are the aspects that I've been very cognizant of in my own approach to answer questions. I have a lot of conditioning in regards to speaking quickly, and also trying to ""win over"" people by saying something interesting and keeping the conversation fast-paced, which does not jive with being able to effectively communicate difficult concepts.   Thank you for sharing the video. The last ""stage"" of enlightenment, the ongoing stage, is so interesting.

To address your idea of liking the idea of free will, it really is just that. We want to believe something, but is it true. It is in fact testable.   How to get over the idea we don't have free will shouldn't be something that you fear, but something that you embrace. It is freeing actually. You won't judge yourself or others for that matter. You begin to accept and forgive yourself for your ""stupid"" actions, and you do the same for others. You no longer take things personally. Things are just the way they are. If this knowledge is understood by you, you let go of controlling things in this life, as you begin to realize you never had control. You begin to be the observer of your life. You're not going to do nothing, but will be moved to take action in the realm of helping others, but not in the realm of greed any longer. Things are exactly as they should be. This level of acceptance will or will not occur to you, because again we can't choose this. This is why enlightenment happens when you let go, but never comes when actively trying. You just merely need to have the initial drive towards understanding, and the rest you leave it up to destiny. I hope it is more clear now. :)"

I dont judge myself and I don't judge others even having free will.  The fact that you don't judge others because you think it's all determined to me suggests that your not nearly as enlightened as you think TBH  I dont take things personally even though I think free will exists (sometimes I do.. but that's fine)  I am moved to help others because of free will too..

While on one hand I don't feel like I've offended anyone, except I simply expressed my opinion, while you have called me pretentious, and a know it all.

Name calling does nothing. How does that help?  You've lost your focus and your composure.  It's similar to using violence to enforce your point, except in words. If you need force to convince people of your point, what is that saying about your point? You should bring it back to the point of your original post and convince me, or don't respond. There's no need to stoop to name calling in a discussion, especially if your mind is clear."

If you don't have free will who is making your actions?  It seems like you are being a victim to a force outside of you.  You are just being pushed around by life.  But you see, as you said.. there is no ""you"" that's being pushed around.  YOU are part of the process.  Hence, you do have free will.  To me, it's oscillating. Sometimes the process does you. And sometimes you dictate it.  But based on what you wrote it's like you are just a leaf to the whims of the wind..  rathe than being that dictates the world.  Free will and determinism exist both at the same time. oscilating between the extremes."
awakened,3ccyiv,wookieeatwork,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"We must discuss what you mean by free will. As a human on this plane of existence, we don't. As the conscious author of thoughts we are not. Maybe this is where we misunderstood.   Who makes our decisions isn't the discussion here. You would know that answer and I wouldn't have to say.   You see, you automatically say victim. There are no victims. Everything is as it should be. That's shows that you are still seeing things in a certain way.     I don't get pushed, I move with it.  You think I actually feel bad about this?  I told you it's totally freeing to not judge myself. Again, you're seeing things in a certain way, so you have a way of seeing all this.  Both ""victim"" and being pushed  around both seem to have a negative connotation to them. There is no resistance. You see things on the negative so you see yourself as a victim.  So yes we are part of it in the highest sense.   Your comment before in another post was that you didn't give much thought to thought. Where in this body does anything come from?  You also said that you don't see how the way thoughts arise dictates free will.  Everything arises in the mind in this body, before it is acted upon. What you think...you do. Know what I mean?    Look, forget it. I'm wrong you're right. I'm fine with that. The truth never needs to be defended. If you're right good... If I'm right good too.

We are trying to work this like a group project, our mutual understanding is key here.   There is what Buddhist's call skilful teaching and unskillful teaching. To explain we are all one would not likely be well accepted by all. You teach what the person is able to understand without losing them.   Keep in mind that we're no longer speaking of free will any longer. We are traveling down a different path all together.   If you understand nonduality, then you'll understand we are not separate. Since you like Alan Watts, he describes it like everything (consciousness/universe/source/god)  is like the ocean. Every wave isn't separate from the ocean. It is doing what the ocean is doing. Waves and troughs essentially.     When we identify with ourselves as an individual with our egos with wants and aversions, we aren't seeing the whole ocean. Just as a wave or a trough. It depends if we zoom in or zoom out. One cell in your arm for example, is that your arm?  Your finger, is that you?  Pull back further to your whole body is that you, or are you interdependent with our environment?  Food water light warmth etc. Without these things we wouldn't exist. Now our town city continent oceans world universe on and on.   This is where things get crazy. From consciousness comes everything including this universe and other realities. In order for this particular universe to operate we must have Hitler and the greatest ""evils"" to make it what it is. Basically, what is light if there is no dark?  Our bodies and minds are created in duality, so here we must see things in this nature, underneath it all we must see what is always present. In all our experiences there is awareness/consciousness. Without it, our experiences mean nothing without it.  Sorry if this gets crazy, but I'm not great at explaining things. Some of these guys are great writers. I think they're English majors out something. Lol.   I wouldn't tell her things are the way things should be because it would be unskillful. Her suffering is what allows another to understand happiness. She defines them with her current state of being.   The only way I think is possible to slowly break people into understanding was through the free will topic. It is easily identified with and testable so that's why I use it. I felt it was a great beginning stage. It was my beginning, and I had hoped it would be for others.   Talking is best, as typing really sucks, but I hope I shed some light on things. Otherwise I made it worse.  If you want to question further, I'll try, but refer someone who's a better writer to our discussion and maybe he/she can help us both. Try woo-woo-way. He knows his stuff I feel amongst other people here."

awakened,3ccyiv,no1113,2,Tue Jul 7 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"This is something I've thought about a lot through various worldviews. I was raised Baptist, did a stint as an atheist and currently identify as a pantheistic pagan, so there's an idea of the different hats I've worn when addressing this question.     To me, it isn't so much about predetermined actions versus free will, but a matter of cosmic balance. The world is always trying to fall into homeostasis, the perfect balance where everything works and things run smoothly and there isn't change. That is the way nature works, constantly adapting to new issues to bring back balance. When the air gets too hot and too humid, we have a thunderstorm to even things out.     Human ego is a HUGE disturbance in the cosmic balance. Free will means that you get to do whatever you want, and you know what? You can. But it may not be as easy as you think. You may think you can bend your knee backwards, and you know what? You can. But your brain will send you signals in the form of resistance and pain to tell you that isn't your best option. I think the synchronicity we experience and the push and pull of our life is more like that. You can try to do whatever you want, but the universe will let you know if it is a bad idea and will try to do what it can to maintain the balance it needs.     If you think of the body as a metaphor for the Universe, things start to make more sense, at least to me. I see humanity as a group of parasites trying to take over and the Universe is the body, trying to maintain a healthy life. Synchronicity and resistance are like the immune system. However, nothing is infallible, and humanity is strong. I also think that sometimes, parasites can be beneficial to their hosts, or have no impact at all, based on how they live.      I think that we have a right to choose what we want to do with respect to cosmic balance. I think when we start pushing away from that respect we will find much more turbulence in our life. I think that these are all natural forces that we should learn to play into to achieve harmony, but I don't think we are obligated by cosmic rules either way. It's all pretty wibbley wobbly, hence the constant strive towards balance."

It is both, I know that may not make sense to some people well to me the fact that it don't make sense makes the ultimate sense. Just like the rational thing is nothing is rational. :-) heh!   All possibilities exist already, reality's, parallels, dimensions, its nutz. and I am pretty sure all the decisions you are going to make are also already known to source, your soul, life, the real you (whatever). Shifting thru the infinite now moment is were the choice is, even if they are already known it don't matter.   I used to think that meant I don't have free-will. One day last year after a massive unfolding I started communicating with guidance directly, and it was showing me things having me go all over the place doing stuff, sometimes silly things (so I thought), teaching me stuff, showing me that it knew were everything was, these were one of many times reality started getting very weird, every moment was a super synchronicity. At one point I was joking with it saying ""man I am starting to feel like a puppet do I even have free will""... its response ""slap yourself"" ... I was like ""no""... ""then there you go."" Then I was like but you already knew that was going to happen... its response was ""yup""... LOL.   Just like free will, it seems like you have a choice and that is the free will even though its already known and synchronized with all of time and space, past and future. It cannot be one with out the other. Just like you cannot have one without the many or a body with out cells. Nor can you have no-free will if you don't have free will, yet it is both and neither."

awakened,3ccyiv,wubw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Hey GJLuke. I will try my best to define the undefinable.. but at best it will be a metaphor, so it all depends on the metaphor and how one want to commune with it.  It is (source) God, it is intuition, it is also what we call ""Life"" or ""our life""! It is our soul. It is the driver of the dream bus. It is the part of you that choose to experience this. It is the stage the actors and the viewers. It is part of the human collective, planet collective, galactic collective, reality collective, infinite parallels and infinite dimensions with all there stuff and then it is part of the stuff this can't even fathom or understand. It part of all of us because it will talk to me and my wife at the same time so its beyond just individual.   The first time I started communicating with it directly was 12 month ago after my first massive poping. I asked it directly what is this that I am talking too? It comes in emanations that I translate to English. Like the way one communes with entities in DMT.   It is Thoughtless Thought that flows freely and abundantly without any resistance. My Wife call this connection Kenetic love. heh I love that! It never has any judgement but it does seem to have preferences. It is the part I stay in alignment with. If I flow away from it I will feel dissonance, I flow with its preference I feel resonance.   It says its me, and I am it. It says it's my soul, it says it is source, at first I didn't get it, now I do. We can infinitely (illusionalry) partition our self's to differentiate with the rest of our infinite self's to form infinite experience to play with our self's. And example it tells me its like a black checker on the checker board talking to the whole board even though we are the whole board too but this POV part of it is just playing the black checker.   It has taught me some far out stuff, but has backed up the goods, so I trust it completely now. Especially what some people would consider Sci-Fi stuff, omg I had no idea what this was before, how exciting.   Brief story one of many examples. It says we are the dream of our-selfs. It told both me and my wife that she if a manifestation of me and I am manifestation of her, everyone is of each other. This was confusing at first. One night a while ago when we were getting used to this intense energy and communications I was meditating while she was fast asleep snoring a bit. I was communing with this part of me I ask it it, ""is my wife really a manifestation of me?"" suddenly my wife turned over and SHE said ""yes""... goosebumps up my spine. A week later rational was kicking in so I woke in the middle of the night and was thinking ""wow is this for real or was that a coincidence? Are we really manifestations of each other"".... again my wife said louder ""YES!"" in her sleep. So after many adventures I no longer doubt this with others, reality exprience shifts, time shifts, lucid dream teachings, obe's, parallel lives, , other life memories, visions, dimensional weirdness, other communications, visitations, what not I have broken down to except to the strangeness and interconnectedness of it all. The rational part of me had to be broken down. Some parts and teachings where so strange I would have surly thought I went Mad if it wasn't for my current playmate self (wife) going through this with me, and she used to make fun of New Age quacks as did I. (thats ok, I understand old me's ignorance) as I am sure I will a year from now too for this point in time (now). heh.   Now I find it funny, like just last week I was sitting there churning out some creative idea but kept poping into some past things trying to use rational again, this guidance kicked in and said ""lets not go there for now""... I kept doing it. Again it said "" lets just be silent""... again I ignored guidance. Then my wife walks in the room I was sitting in with my eyes closed and taps me hard on the forehead two times. Then the emanation tells me ... ""silence, now that we have our attention"". I  just laughed... and later asked my wife why she did that. Her response was ""l am not sure, life asked me to do it"". hehe. The funny part is when guidance is talking to both of us at the same time we are like two people merged we can hand each other things or go someplace with out knowing where and we both get pulled with we call the NUDGE in certain directions. Its like living in the moment with a Divine GPS. how fun and omg the Synchronicities are the off the charts. Its like finally I get to play with life and it plays with me, even though I know it IS me, us it.. whatever.   Not sure if any of this cleared it up from our point of view or confused it more. heh."

This can be a challenging thing to describe but I will do my best. Life has takening me on a winding corse this to Open My Heart and just Be and to have compassion if it enters my experience but to not to have sorrow. Example if you were in the worst spot possible a light being may come to ones aid to GIVE strength and compassion, rather than match there tears of saddness and sorrow.   Unlike a Jedi who manipulates the force to do their bidding it SEEMs (perception) I have no control over it, yet at the same time I do, well other parts of me do much in the same way I don't consciously control my circulatory system, yet I effect it with what I do, say, think, belief, put in this form...etc. Everything is made of collectives with in collectives with in  collectives ""Turtles all the way down baby!"" Infinite changing states that in turn effect all other states.   Ever have a lucid dream? Or enter a Lucid dream state from meditation that literally seems to pop u in another reality? If not or if so examine the characters (if its close to this experience at least). You will notice you can feel there emotions too like here, they will talk to you like they do here, if you fuck with them they may think your wierd, strange or bizzare, many times you will tell them this is a dream they may look at you strange as if they don't believe you...   Shifting reality states, quantum leaps, parallel swaps. I used to think this was bullshit till I got to experience one first hand. It was so freaky at the time, long story short about 5 months ago (what a nutter day) I was being arrested again for helping out this seeming older homeless lady in LA get over her hatred for life, her body, and to assist in not taking life so serious. It was working out splendidly then thru a series of hilarity reality corkscrewing events I was being arrested again as the cuffs went on my Guidiance kicked in over drive and it was saying to me over and over ""we are not playing this way, we were not playing this way"" ... whabam, I saw reality bending, I saw versions of reality overlayed on top of each other each reality I swapped into for a brief second I could feel what version of this body felt. It felt like reality was a house of mirrors, it went faster and faster, I felt cold and wet, ...there was NO ME, Untill the reality I jumped into was I laying on a park bench naked & dehydrated, not remembering this name, saying I am from everywhere, some passerby was concerned for me not knowing who I was and not seeming well so they called the paramedics. It took several moments for the experiential potential pathways this traveled (memories) to kick back in. I was being arrested one moment then, then in the hospital. The events played out slightly different from the two realities. So I was in the hospital because for sever dehydratetion. My wife had to come pick me up by Taxi later, because I had the car. she thought I must have been abducted again, .. she was concerned. ""She said were is the car?"" I said I don't know, I don't have the keys or my wallet, since I was found on the park bench naked. I told her what happened, she was like amazed. We got outside the hospital, and guidance kicked back and took us around 2 blocks away. Our car was sitting there with the windows down and the keys on the dash. My wife was in Shock, she was still getting used to all this after her poping and our UFO events she knows this is not what it appears to be. This fucked me up for a while... I was like is it possible? Shifting realities... then what does that mean? What about the other versions of me, did that version go to jail? Or these other infinite potentials, probabilities being actualized? Are we all zigging and zagging through infinite potentials. What does that mean if I see suffering? Or killing?... oh man it was confusing. Paradigm shattering.   If this is a dream of ourselves, if we create our own reality, if what you put out is what you get back, if we dance with our POV interconnected with our partner the experience then what is pain and suffering? I have been in the video game industry for 18 years as a CGI Character Artist. I know with games we have things like collision box's and health bars, if you do good or don't get injured you health is fine. Pain is just there as a vehicle damage sensor if you really want to break it down. It is usually human players that exploit this damage sensor structure for power, intimidation and gain.   This could get really long because many other things have happened so I will just break it down how my inner guidiance (life) has taught me to play it so far until I have more experiences to see it otherwise.  ""What ever reality we are currently playing in, it is safe to ASSUME that others are experience it the way I am (even if their not because I won't know unless my essence swaps into them). I (this) is to follow passions, watch my thoughts because this experience is interactive and helps shape the narrative. To help others if they ask or are guided too out of good feelings, if I don't feel good doing it then I shouldn't do it. Not be overly concerned with what others do but play the way we choose to play and how we would like others to play, with love and gratitude, by not limiting others yet we can choose also that nothing limits us. To keep expanding lucidity, be an example and have Fun, Dream Big, yet be content and thankfull like a big Kid. That this is like a dream, it can be a nightmare or paradise to play in. I am to trust myself and love myself completely (the expanded self). Thier are no mistakes. I don't have to understand it but trust LIFE that is part of the neverending story of existence, creation and expansion and exploration of ourselfs.""

I'm often very confused about life haha. I often think about others suffering. I think because it's a fear that someday I might experience some insane suffering.  I was reading some Jung earlier and it was about how everything is secretly light. And the particles that are ""dark"" are secretly light once illuminated.  And we need the illusion of darkness to know the light.  (but we still have to experience the pain of the darkness though....?)  Something like that..

I freaking love when it happens around others.  That is a great quote! And I totally agree. I love Jung. this was huge for me, Jung's ""seven sermons to the dead""  Life is Magical and Weird. I know what you mean about some day facing suffering but with a trust in life it won't be the same. Since you know that you are the way, the truth and the life. One does not need to experience it because its already being experienced by (greater) YOU. Plus your essence might have already experienced it in a past parallel life. Also if it does happen, Life will always have your back and wouldn't put you threw it but for expansion. Example: ""lets say tomorrow you broke your arm's in an accident, it may be synchronistic to show others how to heal fast, plus maybe you will meet somebody you would not have otherwise...etc."" ... this too shall pass.

Any one flea, in all likelihood, would neeeever ever even come close to traversing the entirety of that Texas-sized petri dish from end to end before the end of its little flea life.  As such, that flea would effectively feel that it was indeed ""free"" to roam wherever it wanted.  However, the fact of the matter is that the fleas in this example are really very confined little animals allowed only the smallest fraction of a slice of the space upon a much larger planet revolving in a much larger solar system, existing in a much larger galaxy, etc, etc, etc.  Those fleas, as such, are most definitely NOT by any stretch of the imagination free.  So what are my thoughts on free will?  Physically speaking? in this third dimension?  My thoughts on it are that it absolutely does not exist.

True creativity comes when you see something that can't be explained merely by careful analysis -that's not to say that analysis isn't important, just that analysis won't lead to truly creative processes. That requires being able to allow your mind to wander spontaneously, which mindfulness practice quite literally trains the brain not to do, and ideally, from that perspective, ""being mindful"" means your mind never wanders, period.  ""Mind-wandering bad,"" period.  Edit: Of course, being someone who practices Transcendental Meditation, I disagree with that interpretation of the Buddha's teachings, but I'm told that I'm not a Buddhist because TM comes from Hinduism, blah blah."

I personally don't think that ""analytic strategy"" is what most people mean when they say ""creativity."" The fact that you turned my comments into an excuse to go all ballistic over my purported personal problems suggests that you found my conclusions offensive, even threatening.  And of course, I never said I disagreed with the Buddha, only with the interpretation that claims that he seems to be saying ""practice mindfulness."" How anyone can justify the claim that the Buddha was special because he came up with the current crop of mindfulness practices, all of which appear to be equally effective when you learn them from a book or webpage, is beyond me. How could the practices advocated by the Buddha be innovative when anyone can teach them merely by reading what anyone else has to say on the subject and when they are found every where as the last written gasp of oral traditions in every religion and spiritual tradition.  The obvious alternate explanation is that what the BUddha taught and what people think he taught are two different things. The practices handed town through the oral traditions of a spiritual tradition are highly susceptible to ""the telephone effect,"" at least according to MY tradition, and that is the reason why Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was so anal retentive about every TM teacher memorizing every little detail when teaching.  And that is why people who learn meditation from a book or webpage get all upset at the thought that learning spiritual practices from a book or website isn't the best idea.

That is why things like Hatha Yoga, a series of physical exercises, or Pranayama, a set of breathing exercises, have any effect at all: they change the nervous system to support a more holistic perspective.  Edit: and as someone else pointed out, the writer I quoted was someone whom Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (his teacher) believed was ""reasonably mature"" with respect to those physical changes in the nervous system. Of course, there's always room for further growth, no matter who you are."
awakened,3c5581,theawarenesshabit,5,Sat Jul 4 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"Right on! Beautiful insight! It seems like your realizations are similar to mine right now.  The way I've been noticing this lately is that the ""I"" that we associate with ourselves is part of experience, and all manifest experience is late, meaning that it is secondary to awareness. Awareness is before and behind all that we know, so to speak.   What seems like the present to us in our experience—me typing these words right now on this computer—is actually the near past. The true present is our Self. The awareness of experience. Within that is all of time and space.  Likewise, the voice in the head is experience; it happens after awareness. It's an echo. The sense of doing something by the personal self is similarly a manifestation.  It's late. It's not the cause of anything—it is already caused, and we know this because we are aware of it.  This has been tremendously freeing to know that when my superego starts talking (the voice that thinks it's the inner guru), I can immediately recognize that it's not really helping. It's narrating what already is. It's late to the party."
