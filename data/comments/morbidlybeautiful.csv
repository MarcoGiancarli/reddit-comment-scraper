Under the rule of the Soviet Union, however, much of the water in the sea was used in a large scale irrigation project to build up cotton production in the surrounding region.  Now, the Aral Sea (once home to an enormous fishing industry) is largely dried up and dead.  Ships that were once the livelihood of area residents now sit corroding in a vast scrubland that used to be a lake."

morbidlybeautiful,39qh9o,ZomNoms,17,Sat Jun 13 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"I've seen some of these skeletons before online, and most (all?) of them are martyrs/saints.  I seem to remember that some of them had been dead for a very, very long time before someone decided to decorate them.  Catholic churches liked to have body parts or whole bodies of saints around--people would make pilgrammages from far away to get some kind of blessing from that particular saint.  So that's how some of them came to be passed on for hundreds of (sometimes over a thousand) years.   Edit: these specific skeletons are probably not who they say they are.  Apparently they were found in the Roman catacombs in 1578, and it was believed that they were the missing saint relic skeletons that had been seized from churches during the Reformation (rise of Luther's Protestant branch).  So they were distributed among the churches who had had saints stolen.  Article"
morbidlybeautiful,39qh9o,jenny_dreadful,5,Sun Jun 14 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. The skeletons were all taken from a newly discovered Roman catacomb on the flimsy (and probably entirely false in most cases) pretence that they belonged to Christians martyred by the Romans. Whether or not the Catholic Church actually believed that, they saw their value as propaganda. They exhumed the ""relics"" and decorated them, giving them the names of saints and putting them on display in churches around Europe. Before that, they were all just ordinary skeletons of anonymous Jews and Romans, and theoretically a Christian or two could have slipped in to the mix."

morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,maxfortitude,4,Wed Jun 3 06:38:06 2015 UTC,What lovely work. A means of peering into the mind of those who wish it to end and see the beauty on the other end.
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,Shizo211,-1,Wed Jun 3 04:16:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I would describe it as ""beauty on the other end"" since it is literally nothing. It's not something you actively observe and enjoy it's just the end of what situation you were put in before. But after all it's nothing."
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,maxfortitude,8,Wed Jun 3 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. There is no difference physically. It only becomes noticeable when the mindset it switched from the, ""How long must I endure?"" to ""It is finally over.""  The color on the other side of the noose is to visualize this change."
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,phantom_of-the_oprah,3,Wed Jun 3 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"Great explanation. It can also be interpreted in another way:  Outside of the noose, life is gray. Once you fit on the noose; you realize that not everything is dark and gray, moments before making the final decision."
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,Chrisgomez182,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"True. I still feel that out dude if the noose should somehow convey poison and suffering and on the inside just the lack of suffering. This representation exonerates the will to improve, rather it glorifies taking the way out. It's cool to play around with, but some people in the song head space could really take this the wrong way"
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,Murbah,10,Wed Jun 3 06:12:31 2015 UTC,isn't this basically glorifying suicide?
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,123bumblebee,43,Wed Jun 3 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't call it 'glorifying'. It's more like insight into another perspective. The color is a metaphor.   It only becomes noticeable when the mindset is switched from the, ""How long must I endure suffering?"" to ""It is finally over."" The color on the other side of the noose is to visualize this change.  -/u/maxfortitude  The color on the other side of the noose could be completely black, but non-depressed people wouldn't associate the blackness with an appealing end. The color allows non-depressed people to see how a depressed person may see beauty, and feel tranquility in knowing there is an end."
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,Chanl3r,18,Wed Jun 3 07:18:00 2015 UTC,I interpret it as reflecting how when people are too far along the suicide procedure they start to realize life is beautiful and their problems are fixable. People who've survived jumping off bridges have said they've felt like all their problems were fixable in hindsight but that could just be the mind entering survival mode (whatever not important!)  I think that's further reflected by the fact that the colour/beauty of the world only starts showing once the noose is on.

morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,K0mmon,3,Wed Jun 3 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"I would say there's a pretty defined difference between romantics and open minded people. It's shitty that your friend wanted to commit suicide, but why this makes you mad is difficult to understand.   It's entirely possible that these works are supposed to help people like yourself to understand the state of mind that a suicidal person is in. The color within the noose may represent peace or tranquility to the viewer, but that may just be saying that to some suicide appears to be the only option, not necessarily that it's the right choice."
morbidlybeautiful,38bi77,K0mmon,3,Wed Jun 3 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"I understand what these pieces are trying to convey, and I understand what being suicidal is like, I've been there.   These pieces make me angry because they romanticize and dilute a very ugly and horrible experience.

morbidlybeautiful,382zpt,bro9000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"The pigeon that's dying is obviously not being helped, well except if they are already dying. The benefits I am talking about lie in the reduced strain in resources. If there are too many pigeons (or any animal)  they could cause an imbalance in the ecosystem leading to the deaths of everyone.   For instance, let's say there is a field. On this field there is a large herd. This herd is growing because of the grass. If members of the herd don't die quick they could eat the grass too fast, not letting it grow. This would lead to the herd dying as a whole due to starvation.    But, if wolves were introduced they would kill the weak and dying. Lessening the toll on the grass."
morbidlybeautiful,382zpt,veggiter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"This is a ridiculous argument.  First of all, the reason pigeons are so plentiful in cities is because there is such an abundance of food. They aren't starving to death. There is very little threat to their resources.  Secondly, the other reason pigeons are so plentiful in cities is because nothing else lives there. Nothing else can live their other than tough scavengers.  It's a nearly exclusively human environment.  Pigeons are not some kind of omnipresent pest that's altering urban environments. Humans have created that environmen, and pigeons simply dwell in it.  Even if killing them saved them from starvation or whatever, would you chose getting killed today over the chance to struggle to survive?  I sure as hell wouldn't.   You want to kill pigeons for fun or because they are annoying, whatever, but you aren't helping them.  As far as I can tell, they don't need help."

morbidlybeautiful,3806ch,Stray_Bobkatt,8,Sun May 31 21:42:24 2015 UTC,My Grandmom has Alzheimer's and I'm her caretaker. This was heartbreaking but weirdly cathartic to look at as her mental state has been a steep decline as of late. Thanks for sharing this.
morbidlybeautiful,3806ch,lolliedarko,7,Sun May 31 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"That's why I love reddit I was just like this is cool you know but then to somebody else it can be a big deal. Hats off to you, caring for dementia/Alzheimer's patients is no joke and especially when he or she is a loved one."

morbidlybeautiful,3806ch,Sysiphuslove,4,Sat Jun 13 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"How cruel it is that our souls are bound down to this fragile timebomb of a mind. The needle on a record player, it breaks so easily and silences our song forever, at least for this time, in this body, right now, never ever to sing the same way again. What a cruelty, and what a loss."

morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,happy_penis,36,Sat May 30 10:08:33 2015 UTC,She looks so confident in herself :) that little shoulder shrug and smirk is adorable.
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,yoinker272,5,Sat May 30 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"That's a really neat video, thanks OP!"
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,Only_Movie_Titles,7,Sat May 30 21:38:50 2015 UTC,All I did is found a video randomly. Thanks anyway.
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,Stray_Bobkatt,4,Sat May 30 21:40:06 2015 UTC,She's really pretty. I thought that would gross me out but it seemed so natural for her. Kudos good link.
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,TheAberzombie,3,Sun May 31 02:36:02 2015 UTC,Is it shaped that way because if it were round it would just roll around uncontrollably?
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,MarrymeCaptHowdy,7,Sun May 31 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"It is shaped like this because she most likely had an enucleation performed. This is a procedure where the eyeball is removed while leaving the surrounding tissue and muscles intact. The eyeball is then replaced with a silicon ball, which is inserted into the tissue, so it's not visible from the outside. This is done to fill the space left by the removed eyeball to keep the facial features mostly intact and also the eye muscles are then connected to the ball. The prosthetic eye is placed in the small space between the eyelid and the ball, so when the patient moves their intact eye, the muscles move the ball and therefore the prosthetic eye moves (somewhat, not perfectly, but still good enough to look natural for the most part) along."
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,NineteenthJester,2,Sun May 31 08:27:36 2015 UTC,Interesting that the fake eye can move at all.
morbidlybeautiful,37tvaw,MarrymeCaptHowdy,1 point,Sun May 31 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, we have come some way with eye surgery. See my other comment about the shape if you are interested in how it works."

morbidlybeautiful,37co4s,alejv98,3,Wed May 27 12:35:26 2015 UTC,Awesome job on recovery. I would renew personally. My first and inky tattoo is a whole sleeve on my left so I'm edgy like that.

morbidlybeautiful,37co4s,psilocybes,7,Tue May 26 17:49:59 2015 UTC,Here you go.   One is the text itself and the other is an overlay. Sorry about that!
morbidlybeautiful,37co4s,FloydNestaOTool,2,Tue May 26 17:59:40 2015 UTC,That is very cool actually.
morbidlybeautiful,37avpu,_retro_future,3,Tue May 26 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"This was a part of the ""Most beautiful song"" Spotify playlist /r/music put together last summer. I got some killer songs from that thing. This was one of them.   By far my favorite to come out of it."
morbidlybeautiful,37avpu,DratThePopulation,3,Tue May 26 14:18:54 2015 UTC,I am going to go find that right now.
morbidlybeautiful,37avpu,TheWetRat,3,Tue May 26 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:  ""Hospice tells the story of a relationship between a husband and his wife, their journey while she is suffering from terminal bone cancer, their ensuing romance, and their slow downward spiral as a result of the woman's traumas, fears, and disease. Frontman Peter Silberman has been reluctant to divulge explicit details regarding the meaning of the record, and the extent to which it is autobiographical.""  Damn, this sounds like it's gonna be a trip."
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,black_rose_,16,Sun May 24 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ever since I heard of bog bodies, I had a secret longing to get a bunch of tattoos telling the story of how life was like while I was alive and then be thrown in a bog when I die.  I don't even have any tattoos. And I'm no where near bogs."
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,AlexaviortheBravier,13,Sun May 24 04:30:29 2015 UTC,I wish there was a tattoo museum where people currently alive could donate their skins when they die. Would be fucking great to visit and see. I guess instagram is ok too.
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,radiodog,15,Sun May 24 04:58:43 2015 UTC,Dr. Masaichi Fukushi and Dr. Katsunar Fukushi (father and son) actually do this.  This article (scroll down) actually shows some of the skins  Apologies for the rather odd links. It's a bit harder than I expected to find scholarly articles on their work and collection.
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,kyyappeeh,8,Sun May 24 07:11:49 2015 UTC,That is some Lord of the Rings shit right there.
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,vibrate,4,Sun May 24 12:46:53 2015 UTC,More likely the exposed part was eaten by carrion birds and maggots.
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,vibrate,2,Sun May 24 09:14:30 2015 UTC,How would carrion eat itself?
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,jrd_dthsqd,3,Sun May 24 17:57:16 2015 UTC,typo - meant carrion birds (crows etc)
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,kogasmuk,1 point,Sun May 24 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Bogs should be like thick mud from what I remember vaguely. Enough to preserve. Bog bodies are really preserved unlike dirt bodies. This looks like water which is why I'm skeptic, top wool blew away and the water heavy wool stayed? Or I'm just speculating."
morbidlybeautiful,371rci,kevinhugh91,8,Sun May 24 08:04:32 2015 UTC,Bogs are when the water turns acidic due to lack of water circulation and sphagnum moss growing layers and layers upon itself. Over many years the entire surface of a bog can become covered by a thick mat of moss.   At least that's what the bogs are like in my area. I know that some bogs are just swampy areas with grasses too.
