EmoScreamo,3doqgz,helladankhippogriff,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:26 2015 UTC,7th chords for sure. Major and minor. Major 7ths sound pretty intense when used well. Specifically in the voicing of x354xx
EmoScreamo,3doqgz,perortico,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:33:21 2015 UTC,I make up chords using the notes from any major scale and as you said moving some fingers to change it

I Don't Want to Know Why the Caged Birds Sing also fit the description of sound you're after, albeit they incorporate heavier musical themes as well.  Flowers Taped to Pens, twinkly screamety scrammy skramz.  Park Jefferson, a band featuring ex-merchant ships members, def. worth checking out."

EmoScreamo,39vt0e,isarealboy772,2,Mon Jun 15 14:03:39 2015 UTC,And capo on varying frets helps too.
EmoScreamo,39vt0e,Motherlicka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"I play twinkle in pretty much every tuning but standard, the best tunings in my opinion:  FACGCe  DAEAC#e  Open D (DADF#Ad)  ""Jacktune"" (EAC#AC#e). No one else I know uses this, I kind of came up with it on accident.   It's kind of hard to explain how to ""play twinkle"", but just play around with these tunings. Use the low strings as base notes to build your riffs off of.   Good luck!"

EmoScreamo,398r09,DustbinK,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:13:22 2015 UTC,Well I hate to be that guy but isn't MTVmo something that stemmed from emo?
EmoScreamo,398r09,sekihoutai,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:42:19 2015 UTC,"No, it's not, it's people thinking the music sounds ""emotional"" and shortening the term. You could argue that we could mock it a bit less and just call it ""emo rock"" and point out it has nothing to do with emotionally driven hardcore punk and its derivatives."
EmoScreamo,398r09,DustbinK,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"But if Senses Fail were a bunch of dudes who grew up listening to 90s emotive hardcore and put their spin on it and it happened to become popular (which is what a lot of 00's era pop-screamo stemmed from) is it not still emo? Like I would liken Scary Kids Scaring Kids to MTVmo but they listened to Cap'n Jazz. I guess what I'm getting at is do you know for a fact that it has nothing to do with it emotional hardcore or are you just not into the idea of bands like SF, SKSK, FOB etc being under the emobrella?"
EmoScreamo,398r09,sekihoutai,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:39:58 2015 UTC,I'm sure plenty of bands listened to emo and its derivatives. That just makes it one of their influences. That doesn't make them themselves emo. Influences don't determine genre. That's far too black and white.

EmoScreamo,38qv12,floatate,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:44:56 2015 UTC,Nice! 940 Gilman style?
EmoScreamo,38r913,thecatdidit,8,Sat Jun 6 03:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think the album is good, but not great. I love the guitar arrangements and the song structures. The overall songwriting and lyrics are very well executed. All of that combines to do a great job of masking Kyle's limited vocal range. Many of the songs are in the same key or at least close together. Also, the production seems extraordinary flat. The dynamics found on The Lack Long After and previous works seem notably absent.   When it's good, it's amazing. When it's boring it's really boring. I wish they would blend this in with the more aggressive styling of their past records, but this was a deliberate stylistic choice on their part and I respect that."
EmoScreamo,38r913,stradivari310,7,Sat Jun 6 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"I think their best work so far was the single Hiding kinda a cross between old and new, wish they had gone in that direction.  You nailed the new album pretty well."
EmoScreamo,38r913,Pandos636,2,Sat Jun 6 05:02:21 2015 UTC,I'll drink to that!

I think I'd need a few more listens to say more about Keep You in particular, but I think they can hone their sound even more and make a really beautiful album with this new style they're picking up."
EmoScreamo,38r913,sekihoutai,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that heat bruh. Personally I was smitten with Old Pride and my god that split with Ezra Joyce is fuckin classic. That being said I like their new vibe and all but it doesn't sit well with me too much. But I haven't sat down with that record much so maybe I should take some time. When Title Fight changed that weirded me out, same with Ceremony. Bands grow independent of what their fanbase or listeners want all the time. I think its a cool direction for them but I think I'll hold my breath til the next one."
EmoScreamo,38r913,DustbinK,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:48:33 2015 UTC,I think they have enough of their own style in it to not make it pastiche. The guy still carries emotion in his voice extremely well. Personally I love it and still put it every once in a while even though it's been out for a long while now.  I'm not young anymore and actually dealing with your problems is a much more relatable listen than just bitching about them at this point.

EmoScreamo,38gi54,ChurroMooCow,2,Thu Jun 4 01:31:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like teen suicide
EmoScreamo,38c363,all-up-in-yo-dirt,5,Wed Jun 3 06:48:59 2015 UTC,"This song rules, and Envy is an utter classic.  Their album A dead sinking story remains a true essential screamo album."
EmoScreamo,38c363,Revsting,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:31:52 2015 UTC,All The Footprints You've Ever Left And Fear Expecting Ahead is probably more essential. It shows the transition into the sound while still retaining a lot more of the hardcore qualities that they lost on A Dead Sinking Story. A Dead Sinking Story is just when they got really popular so it's typically the first album people get into from them and hold it in high regard because of that. Still a great album though.
EmoScreamo,38c363,DustbinK,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about the new album yet, but Recitation is fantastic."
EmoScreamo,38c363,jcohle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:29:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Recitation is one of those masterpieces that is hard to match with the next album, kind of like As the Roots Undo."
EmoScreamo,38c363,DustbinK,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:53:04 2015 UTC,Recitation is easily the worse thing in their career. A blight on an otherwise solid career. It was a dull lifeless album that made me think they were at their career's end.  Atheist's Cornea was a huge return to form and is probably the most varied album they've ever done and really brought back the energy they were missing from Recitation.

I'll also include the cabs because although they broke up they also formed in like 2010. Snowing is a given so I think you already listened to it. If not, Fuck Your Emotional Bullshit is a classic. Frameworks' Loom is pretty good too."

EmoScreamo,361mtc,projectrx7,2,Fri May 15 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah isn't and never was a great singer, even on the AF recordings, but his vocals were definitely the weakest part of the shows."

EmoScreamo,35sdsk,Young_Zaphod,2,Wed May 13 02:45:34 2015 UTC,I don't know what it is about this band that I don't like. I guess I feel like it's his aaron weiss-like delivery style. I can respect everything about them but I don't know why I have this sense of revulsion when I listen to them. Anybody else feel like this? Maybe I'm just nuts.
EmoScreamo,35o2h3,LeadMate,2,Tue May 12 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"""Say farewell and promise reencounter"" is the translation I got from emailing the band. Great album. oto_records@hotmail.com if you want to get some lyrics for it!"

Seems as though it's well put together, however, when they play some of these songs live the translation isn't as effective. After adam recorded his parts for this record it seems like brianna and ben didn't know how to approach playing it live. It's not the same. Their live shows are still amazing, but it still isn't the same"
EmoScreamo,35hny4,buenopower,4,Mon May 11 12:28:39 2015 UTC,I haven't figured out why this album just didn't grab me like their earlier stuff
EmoScreamo,35hny4,EmergenL,1 point,Sun May 10 16:45:19 2015 UTC,The fact that most of the original members have left probably explains it.

EmoScreamo,35gj78,WuhanWTF,1 point,Sun May 10 17:27:13 2015 UTC,Maybe lyrically. That opening guitar riff is super depressing though. The sound of it makes the song one of the only emo songs that actually makes me sad.

EmoScreamo,35gj78,cheesemop,4,Sun May 10 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"Depressive Suicidal Black Metal.  Trist is pretty good. The mighty Xasthur of course. The most popular bands in the genre are probably Lifelover and Silencer, but I'm not really a fan of those two bands at all. One of my all time favorite DSBM albums is Suicidal Emotions from Abyssic Hate. Absolute classic, but I don't think you should support this artist, because he is fascist fucking scum. That said, it's a great album and I absolutely recommend pirating it."

EmoScreamo,35gj78,IthinktherforeIthink,-3,Sun May 10 19:22:29 2015 UTC,Anthony Green with Saosin used to be quintessential emo. Circa survive is pretty close. Technically post-hardcore but it's a closely related genre.

I admit  I am heavily inspired by SFFS, not reaching up to their level of course.   I am still proud of it, we recorded it and produced it all by ourselves with crap gear, me and the drummer. My band partner got sick in cancer pretty early too so I did the lyrics, bass, guitar by myself now that he's absent. I don't want to tell too many about the circumstances because I want as many as possible to enjoy it for what it is.   Again thank you for being honest. I feel like most of my friends are afraid of giving me critique due to the subject matter and my drummer having cancer.   Cheers! I hope you will enjoy my coming albums more."

EmoScreamo,34zjkc,mcscottmc,1 point,Tue May 5 23:00:33 2015 UTC,"When they were touring together, Texas is the Reason and Promise Ring were about equal - with TitR maybe being a bit more popular because of their label. The difference was TitR broke up and PR toured like crazy."

EmoScreamo,34zjkc,wordsforsnow,1 point,Wed May 6 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"From what I know they were put together in honor of their bestfriend/guitarist who had passed away in a car accident, I don't think it was ever really meant to be anything other than a project to afford them the opportunity to vent. I could be wrong about that last part though, regardless the band didn't last very long."
EmoScreamo,34zjkc,iamdavidspade18,1 point,Wed May 6 03:54:48 2015 UTC,"I think the vocalists at least went on to form A New Kind of American Saint, which didn't last long either. They were more hardcore, and I never really got into them. Interestingly though, their album cover for Take a Shit was apparently stolen by Saves the Day for Through Being Cool"

EmoScreamo,34zjkc,iamdavidspade18,1 point,Wed May 6 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I added them afterwards. I was just thinking in terms of popularity, everybody knows Mineral, SDRE, but Ethel Meserve doesn't get much attention."

EmoScreamo,34zjkc,senraku,2,Tue May 5 21:38:31 2015 UTC,Well that's really part of the intrigue of the discussion. I suppose some of the obvious signs are label signings and tours with other notable bands. But that's just me

EmoScreamo,34n09h,foreskinpiranha,13,Sat May 2 17:18:24 2015 UTC,I'd recommend Gospel (The Moon is a Dead World is their only widely available record iirc) and Funeral Diner (particularly The Underdark).
EmoScreamo,34n09h,PopPunkAndPizza,9,Sat May 2 22:03:42 2015 UTC,My favorite skramz band was majority rule. They played with circle takes the square and pg 99 a lot. City of caterpillar did too. Mass movement of the moth is pretty good also.

EmoScreamo,33ggs5,qwerty887,2,Wed Apr 22 09:23:39 2015 UTC,What's with the American accents?
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,infinitepleb,6,Wed Apr 22 13:41:38 2015 UTC,Lots of Australians grow up on American music. In turn they end up singing along to these songs in an American accent. This becomes a staple in there singing ability. It starts to sound odd when you stray back in to the Australian accent whilst singing.   Source - Australian who sings in American accent.
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,SqueezingStones,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"I'm Australian as well, and this shit is weird. It's not just one vocalist, both of them seem to be singing in an american accent. The music's pretty good, but the accents just turn me off. It's not just a singing accent either, the spoken bits are in an american accent, with the occasional out of placing Australian accented word.  I can't help it but it reminds me of crappy commercial footy-bro metalcore bands like Amity Affliction and House vs. Hurricane"
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,infinitepleb,3,Thu Apr 23 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"I am actually yet to listen to it. Pretty bummed to hear it is Metalcore and not Screamo. Metalcore is fucking huge here, right? Can't fucking stand the generic stuff like the bands you mentioned above. Will have a listen and judge for myself when I get home."
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,SqueezingStones,3,Thu Apr 23 05:39:24 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it definitely has some good elements, but it's kind of a mix between Amity Affliction and Pianos Become the Teeth. The american accent really just turns me off cos I haven't heard it in any good Australian screamo or post-hardcorey kinda stuff, only in the commercial things like I mentioned earlier.  The first half of the song is really good, but aided by the double kicks and the clean vocals mixed with the harsh that come in about halfway (comes back in with about 30 seconds left) , it has that metalcore flavour of Amity and such. It's a shame, seems like they've got some great influences, but then have added in some elements from the Australian commercial hardcore scene, or as I like to call it, the dark-side of Australian hardcore."
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,infinitepleb,4,Thu Apr 23 05:48:40 2015 UTC,"Haha the Dark Side of Australian Hardcore. I like it. I will report back when I listen to it. In the mean time, seeing as you mentioned you haven't heard any decent Aussie Screamo/Post-hardcore. Check these guys out, they are all great!   Raccoon City  Stockades  Nebraska"
EmoScreamo,33ggs5,SqueezingStones,2,Thu Apr 23 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"Haha I've heard plenty, just not with American accents. There's some great stuff over here.  Great picks by the way.

EmoScreamo,33f4m4,fssdff,5,Wed Apr 22 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"My favorite albums are One Hundred Dollar Room and Bridges Worth Burning, but his entire discography is impressive and I listen to it all. Check out Blunt Mechanic, which was a brief project Ben fronted in 2010. While I wouldn't call Ben's music ""emo"" overall, his music is very emotionally driven but to me its just straightup punk at the end of the day. He's a great dude too, really genuine and friendly. Anyone catch any of the shows since he started touring again over the last 4 or 5 years?"
EmoScreamo,33f4m4,sv3nian,2,Wed Apr 22 01:18:03 2015 UTC,i haven't gone through all of his discog yet but bridges worth burning is definitely my favourite album so far. i guess emotionally driven punk is kinda the definition of emo but i get your point haha. i'm not from NA so there are little to no chances of seeing him live which sucks. gotta check out blunt mechanic asap!
EmoScreamo,33f4m4,sv3nian,2,Wed Apr 22 06:15:46 2015 UTC,"Blunt Mechanic and the newest KOLS split with Warren Wilson & Founding Fathers is great. More upbeat and positive songs, but go on Spotify and check out all the albums!"

No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, entire albums as one single video, or streaming a video in the first place. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp."

We actually never played or created music when we were sober so, we were thinking of making a bit of a more serious comeback perhaps.

The ä is pronounced similar to an English 'eh'. Like this. Så sounds sort of like a longer English 'so'. The word itself itself isn't on forvo, but å is good enough. Swedish 'y' is a bit more difficult, as it's a sound we don't really have in English. It's similar to the German ü, if you know German. Here's an okay pronunciation."

EmoScreamo,2ygagy,countoftuscany06,3,Mon Mar 9 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't really listen to thattt much within the genre (I mostly just like Joyce Manor and couple others a lot haha) but since no one's gotten back to you I'll give some feedback!  Track 1: I really like the opening guitar riff. The vocal sound is a bit weird at that first shout type thing. Around 1:24 it gets a bit out of time. Personally, around 2:08 I would've liked some really forceful yelling, but that might just be me.   Track 2: I like the opening drum pattern. I think so far I would like the vocals to be a bit more audible in general, but that's just my personal preference. Also I think the drums are a bit loud compared to everything else. The last ~30 seconds have a very cool feel to it, good job.  Track 3: Yeah, I still would the like vocals a bit louder so I could more easily decipher the lyrics. 1:33 and a bit after sounds awesome! Fucking love it! I'm loving the vocals in the empty space. I really dig from then until the end of the song.  Track 4: First minute or two is pretty good, just make sure that all of the drums are in time. For me, hearing even little stutters kind of just drags me out of the music. Tempo gets weird around 2:27ish. I dig the last 30 seconds or so.  Track 5: The general sound of the vocals at :26-51 I like a lot. at 1:35 the buzz roll ends at a really weird spot, I would personally pulse the roll so it ends on a downbeat. Also make sure the tempo doesn't drop when there are more notes added in.  Track 6: Ride cymbal in the beginning is out of time. So is the stuff around :40 or so. Snare eighth notes are also out of time. To be honest, I first clicked on this track and almost turned it off because of the drums (I'm a drummer if that isn't apparent through my feedback yet haha). I really like the idea of the stuff you're doing with the drums, just really make sure it's nailed down and the rhythms are correct. Also, I still want the vocals louder/more audible. Drums around 2:57ish are awesome. 3:26 is cool all around, just make sure it doesn't drag tempo-wise when the guitar/drums come in.  Overall: Pretty good, would like to hear the drums be a bit more consistent and the vocals to be clearer."
EmoScreamo,2ygagy,oxygenvictim,2,Mon Mar 9 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that. I wasn't expecting anyone to go so in depth but I'm glad you did! I'm the drummer and the reason everything seemed so out of time was because we recorded the scratch track without using a metronome. We learned our lesson though. Also, the very last song we wrote the week before and I fucked up a bunch of fills and I'm aware of that. Plan on re recording it. Also, needed to get the floor tom less boomy. Thank you for your criticism though, I'll share this with the other guys!"
EmoScreamo,2ygagy,oxygenvictim,2,Mon Mar 9 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"No problem, I was a bored and procrastinating doing work. I also appreciate that you guys are open to criticism, it's a very good quality to have."
EmoScreamo,2ygagy,KieranTrojanowski,2,Mon Mar 9 22:13:30 2015 UTC,Definitely! And the tempo thing still bugs me. I noticed it the moment I was tracking and it pissed me off. I can't even listen to our songs because of it! Glad to help procrastinate though
EmoScreamo,2ygagy,speakoN,3,Mon Mar 9 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the entire album.  My only recommendation would be that the vocalist project himself more.  The recording sounds very good so I don't think that's the issue, though the rest of the band does tend to drown him out a bit. Really reminded me of the first 2 EPs from Daylight which was by far their best music."

Luke Goes To Bledfest is still my favorite video on youtube. And they aren´t really emo, but Kublai Khan is on of the sickest bands on the line up this year."

EmoScreamo,2xl1ui,javabrunn,3,Sun Mar 1 18:54:36 2015 UTC,YES. End States and Invasive:Exotic are both spectacular albums I highly recommend them!.
EmoScreamo,2xgwin,GoodMolemanToYou,2,Sat Feb 28 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"/u/Shitgenstein's Native Nod post reminded me of a song I've been meaning to post for a while. After Native Nod, Chris Leo (Ted Leo's brother) started the Van Pelt, playing a similar but more structured and more melodic style of emo punk. This is my favorite song off their first album."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,Saetia_V_Neck,5,Sat Feb 28 04:26:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. It is hands down their best album. In my opinion, the second best album of last year next to La Dispute's."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,smiles134,4,Sat Feb 28 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, you loved two releases that deflated my love for two bands that were coming off of two strong previous releases (Lack Long After, Wildlife). Really speaks to how different fan receptions can be to follow-ups."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,tehconx0r,3,Sat Feb 28 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"While Wildlife is my favourite LD album, I do really love RotH a lot as well. Keep You is great but I so was TLLA but I guess I would rate Keep You a tiny bit higher. I guess I just love all their stuff."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,jor1ss,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"They're both different, but that's what I love about them. I think RotH is probably one of my favorite albums of all time."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,smiles134,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like Keep You too much, which kinda bummed me out considering how much I loved Old Pride and Lack Long After, but I loved Rooms of the House. I can't decide whether I like Wildlife or RotH better, they are so different."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,Coxton,7,Sat Feb 28 17:11:29 2015 UTC,One of the biggest disappointments IMO.  It lacks in the worse way.  His singing alone just can't provoke the emotion that past albums have.  The mix of his screams/sining blended so well in the last two albums prior that they will always be favorites of mine.  Cheers to them for doing what they wanted but I still haven't even bothered making it all the way through because it's just too bland for me.
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,KieranTrojanowski,3,Sat Feb 28 05:20:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the album fell flat for me. Listened to it when it was streaming, and other than a few good songs I couldn't get into their new sound. Too polished, felt like the soul was sucked outta it. Cheers for being brave enough to take it in such a new direction, but it was a total dud for me. Real shame."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,tehconx0r,2,Sat Feb 28 08:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's an album that grows on you a decent bit. It took me a few weeks before I got around to listening to it, and it's only really in the last few days that I've really fallen in love with it."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,freshcelery,1 point,Sat Feb 28 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely, you really can't listen to an album once or twice and just dismiss it (obviously there are edge cases here, but that is my general opinion.  When I first heard it, it fell flat for me and this is coming from a PBTT fanboy. After listening to it probably 10 times I really started to realize how emotionally draining this album was. I don't remember the last album I listened to that actually had such a huge emotional affect on me, but this album left me really bummed out (in the best way).   It definitely isn't an album to be listening to all the time, but it has it's place. I wouldn't say it is better than ""The Lack Long After"" or ""Old Pride"" but it is definitely a great album in its own place.  I also think that due to the drastic change in direction taken, this album can be kind of off-putting to some. Especially when they expect a specific sound from a band who had to really hard hitting releases prior. All I can say is to give it more than 1 shot, maybe throw it on in the background when you are just going about your day and I bet one of the songs will hook you (then soon enough they all will)."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,sillyhatsclub,2,Wed Mar 4 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"i enjoyed the songs from it when i saw them play last, but i just cant really get into it in a non live setting.  Its a bummer because i honestly think Old Pride is one of the strongest albums i've ever heard, and i wish i could get into this one more."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,YourFaceIsARapeScene,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen them recently, couldn't get into the new songs then, but I haven't really listened to the new album, I might give it a few spins, but even though I was really into their previous releases I kinda stopped caring for them."

EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,chivalryisdead,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"I listened to it for a week straight in hopes that it would grow on me, it didn't. Some songs had potential to be great but fell flat and ended. I get that their new direction is absent from all the screaming in their previous releases but they could have utilized the emotional sing/scream vocals even if it was the slightest bit to give this album the boost it needed. The songs aren't bad by any means they just aren't terribly memorable."
EmoScreamo,2xfkh5,DustbinK,0,Tue Mar 10 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty incredible. Then again I rarely go into albums with any sort of specific expectations and I listen to an insane variety of music. I think it's just as emotionally evoking, if not more so since you can actually understand what he's saying now, than the previous albums. Plus it's the first album where I feel like he's not just endlessly bitching. A lot of it is about moving on. I'm a firm believer that contrast in music creates the effect of making things more powerful. On this album the result is some really really intense parts where his voice picks up like on track 4 and the album ender."
EmoScreamo,2xdv0a,thatirishguyjohn,2,Fri Feb 27 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"According to discogs, they also released a 3-way split in 2007."

EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,hivein,8,Wed Feb 25 08:40:44 2015 UTC,I honestly just don't get why Dads has gotten so popular recently. So many better acts out there right now.
EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,NickelHoss,10,Wed Feb 25 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"Recently? I thought they were always pretty poplar. Popular to hate, popular to love, popular to circle jerk that they are shit cunts.  To clarify, I like Dads, not a huge fan, but they are pretty good."
EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,SqueezingStones,3,Thu Feb 26 00:53:41 2015 UTC,A friend of mine has promoted a couple of their shows a while back and said that they are most definitely shit cunts.

EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,SqueezingStones,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything specific. I'm friends with people in a band who toured with them and all I heard is that after the tour, they don't maintain a relationship anymore."
EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,stradivari310,8,Thu Feb 26 12:48:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, I saw them live a couple of weeks ago in Orlando and honestly I have never heard a sloppier live band in my life. Drummer/singer should choose one of those two because he is sorely incapable of doing both."
EmoScreamo,2x3ec7,PeePeeMartinez,2,Wed Feb 25 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"they took a fat shit on the diy emo/punk scene and they are only popular to wave kids and people that think emo is in revival, other than that this song is ok."

EmoScreamo,2x1bdz,DustbinK,2,Wed Feb 25 14:34:49 2015 UTC,Definitely not worth going unless you live really close. Very few bands on this line-up worth seeing in my opinion. The line-up's in past years were decent but this one isn't looking promising so far.
EmoScreamo,2x1bdz,smiles134,3,Wed Feb 25 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if you're being sarcastic but calling bled fest deep and diverse is a pretty big stretch especially this year. I mean it's cool that Lydia is on, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the same bands that are on every fest are playing with a few metalcore bands thrown in there. That doesn't make it deep or diverse. The only recent fest type thing that's been worth going to is FEST in Gainesville FL. Which could definitely be more accurately described as deep and diverse."
EmoScreamo,2x1bdz,Young_Zaphod,2,Wed Feb 25 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"Eh I'm not going here for the deep and diverse line up. The tickets are pretty cheap and I'll get to see Sorority Noise, Pianos Become The Teeth, Modern Baseball, Touche Amore, and Spraynard. I know that this isn't on the same level as FEST, it's not really supposed to be... Plus, it's in my home town extremely close to my house and I've never gone before, I felt like I couldn't pass up the opportunity any longer."
EmoScreamo,2x1bdz,SqueezingStones,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, if you're close definitely go, especially if the tickets are cheap.

EmoScreamo,2x1bdz,SqueezingStones,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:33:57 2015 UTC,This year's Austin Blood Alliance had one of the craziest lineups I've ever seen. You really don't know what you're talking about.

I don't disagree with reddiquette as a set of rules to bring out the contributing comments out of a sea of irrelevant comments (like mine), but it can't really sail if there isn't any water. At best you'd just diminish the subreddit further. Not many people dare to comment on posts that has few to no comments already, even less so in a scene so ridden with elitists in general. And that's not even mentioning that there is miniscule discussion prospects around posts like these, with bands that are widely known and praised within the scene itself.

EmoScreamo,2wgaqh,SqueezingStones,2,Thu Feb 19 23:59:06 2015 UTC,Maybe try contacting the dudes in the video through youtube? They may have tabs or even write some up for you. If successful you should definitely post them here!
EmoScreamo,2wgaqh,SqueezingStones,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:11:09 2015 UTC,They said that they did some of the main parts in the song by improvisation. But I'll still try. Thanks!

It was a Sleepytime Trio song (that I can't remember the name of) over 50's-era footage of a ship in a storm.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I loved that song.
EmoScreamo,2w6g4r,n5383234,2,Tue Feb 17 09:46:37 2015 UTC,"Wow. I hadn't heard this song in years and decided to listen to it yesterday. Crazy coincidence.   The lyrics are so awesome too:   ""I was sittin' on the lawn with a wide eye to the sun like a dead fish in a big pond.""  ""it didn't help at all that I'm the one you call, it doesn't help me like I know it helps you.""  ""the bed quakes with my weight. the bed doesn't know that you're gone. the bed is lucky it doesn't know you the way that i do.""

EmoScreamo,2vt212,CptBunnyKiller,3,Fri Feb 13 21:17:28 2015 UTC,so a couple of side notes: we recorded everything over the span of a year in a basement and nobody really knew how recording worked so this is basically the sound of figuring everything out. that's also the reason why the songs differ quite a bit in quality. we're extremely happy though to finally have something to show people and we're currently working on some tapes. if you actually take time out of your day to check us out i seriously love you and also any form of feedback is highly appreciated! thank you!

As for the recording it sounds like you guys have an idea for what you want to be. I'd recommend just sitting through the same process. But maybe have some concrete ideas in mind.

EmoScreamo,2vbgxw,sekihoutai,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:55:52 2015 UTC,battle and june were both among the best live sets i've ever seen.  My band was called nigel thornberry and i think this video might be the only record of the fact that we ever existed besides a really bad demo  of songs we never actually played.   the battle of wolf track off the Emo Annihilation comp was like one of my formative memories of getting into the genre so it was pretty incredible playing with them.

I don't suppose you have that really bad demo lying around do you?  I think it was their june paik split for me. I always wanted a slice of the death of affect but never got my hands on it. I dropped like $25 once to get their split with resurrectionists. Damn the euro was strong back then.

I agree the word choice isn't the best here, but paired with the whole phrase, you can get the gist of what they were trying to evoke in the reader.     Gilded vessel   that makes sense to me. Would be something like this:  http://i.imgur.com/xZ7tkkF.jpg    As for cliches in writing, most of us get sick of them (even writers themself), but there are so many already established ""cliches"" that it can be hard to avoid them. I think frequency of use and how appropriate it fits is more important than trying to avoid them completely.    I do get what you're saying, but you have to keep in mind that writing lyrics can be a creative process, not simply a delivery of a message. For example, you may see some styles of poems/songs use words more for their phonetics than actual meaning. You might have a phrase that doesn't make as much sense as a more straight forward wording, but it also isn't as pleasing to hear or perform.  Since it's like drawing, painting, or music making itself, there's lots of room to play with ideas, and they don't always come out perfect (if ever)"

I feel like WAAT has a more consistent and I like how aggressive the guitars are.  And Steps Ascending is pretty much a perfect song imo  Not that Full Collapse is bad, of course. They're practically equal for me, but WAAT edges it out."

Also, I know the music isn't ""emo"" or whatever but when I am feeling ""emo"" the front bottoms somehow just fit. their first album is perfect."
EmoScreamo,2rfff8,zlacapitaine,1 point,Wed Jan 7 07:10:44 2015 UTC,if you like the whole sing-a-long acoustic I'm sad about you thing
EmoScreamo,2rfff8,zlacapitaine,3,Wed Jan 7 07:11:48 2015 UTC,is this what's considered emo screamo now?
EmoScreamo,2rfff8,latteteen,2,Tue Jan 6 00:13:06 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with the fact that many fans of emo also enjoy the front bottoms.  And a lot of people like to say they like one genre so they squeeze this band in based off their lyrics I'd guess.
EmoScreamo,2rfff8,Pleasant_Wombat,-1,Tue Jan 6 01:11:19 2015 UTC,Well they shouldn't
EmoScreamo,2rfff8,cool69,0,Tue Jan 6 09:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree.  They're not an emo band, but nonetheless I always see them mentioned or associated with the genre on reddit for whatever reasons."

EmoScreamo,2rg04m,freshcelery,3,Mon Jan 5 21:58:19 2015 UTC,"No, this is their best album so far. Disappointing is their split with Toys that Kill."
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,mrnotloc,2,Tue Jan 6 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in what you think makes it their best album so far. I like some of the songs, but there are a couple I just can't stand (Heart Tattoo, In The Army Now).   I personally think their S/T was their best album so far. To be fair I have heard that album probably 100 times, where I have only listened to the new album 3 or 4 times full through. I haven't heard their split with Toys that Kill, what makes it disappointing?"
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,BoatToTheMoon21,2,Thu Jan 8 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"You know, I just think it's the band drifting from their original sound and I like it. I mean I love their self titled album for sure but I dig the more relaxed stuff they are doing on Never Hungover Again too. I think its good in its own way. Great band all around though."
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,dyingangry,2,Tue Jan 6 02:33:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, maybe their new sound just isn't for me. It just seems to be lacking the energy from their previous stuff. I am still a fan of a few songs, but it just isn't having the same effect on me as their S/T and EPs before that."
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,9sam1,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:54:18 2015 UTC,they saw how much people loved their s/t so they're not even changing directions at this point. they could probably do better but why would they. never hungover again was eaten up by their fanbase
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,MyBearSaysRawr,2,Tue Jan 6 01:32:28 2015 UTC,"Their S/T was amazing, but they HAVE changed since then. Why would they do better? I would expect their new albums to improve on their previous and for the band to not stagnate or they will lose their fan base."
EmoScreamo,2rg04m,emoNUFC,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"There are a few songs that sound to me like really generic 90s pop punk, but the other songs are all top notch, I think it's a solid release on par with the second album (some gems and some mediocre songs) but not really as good as the S/T which I thought was excellent all the way through. You can't expect a band to just release the same album over and over again though, and I think they've done a good job of growing as a band while keeping alot of what made them great in the first place, which I think is tough to do, so props to them."

I try to look at fc as a whole piece but yeah the first few times were cringey as fuck. Though I have a friend who never listened to emo/screamo/skarmz/whatever and told him to check out fc and sleep patterns was one of his favorite tracks. Go figure.
EmoScreamo,2qw5ip,sekihoutai,1 point,Fri Jan 2 20:27:53 2015 UTC,Midwest Pen Pals - one incident that made the whole fucking thing cringey was the very fucking end where he tells his mom off. Otherwise it could have been a near perfect/and or dope collection.

EmoScreamo,2quff0,Capt_Lightning,0,Thu Jan 1 14:40:23 2015 UTC,You're Gonna Miss It All was so mediocre though
EmoScreamo,2quff0,burnsinthesun,2,Tue Dec 30 21:33:08 2014 UTC,"did you prefer sports to you're gonna miss it all? I was introduced to modern baseball with you're gonna miss it all, but later discovered sports so I'm curious as to where you started with them."
EmoScreamo,2quff0,Capt_Lightning,3,Tue Dec 30 23:12:19 2014 UTC,"Started with Sports, thought it was pretty decent. Then You're Gonna Miss It All threw away a whole bunch of what made Sports good and went with mostly run-of-the-mill pop punk. There's a few good tracks, but it really falls flat as an album."
EmoScreamo,2quff0,burnsinthesun,1 point,Wed Dec 31 06:22:52 2014 UTC,yeah I can see that. Sports has a lot of character (I feel) and I appreciate that it's sort of lowkey/low budget (they recorded it in Drexel's studios on campus) whereas You're Gonna Miss It All is (as you said) straight pop-punk with super polished production.
EmoScreamo,2quff0,Kolm14,1 point,Wed Dec 31 06:57:55 2014 UTC,For me personally I knew them before they announced You're Gonna Miss It All and I prefer Sports. Both albums have a unique sound to them so I think that's why there's a common divide between fans
EmoScreamo,2quff0,burnsinthesun,1 point,Wed Dec 31 00:57:59 2014 UTC,"that definitely makes sense. For better or for worse, there was definitely a change in the sounds between the two albums. I think sports attracted the ""house show crowd"" (per se) when they were starting out playing basements in west philly and YGMIA seems to attract a more stereotypical ""pop punk crowd."" I love modern baseball and they are so fun live but if the crowd continues to move toward the younger ""pop punk"" crowd I don't know how much longer I can go to their shows. I saw them recently and the crowd just wasn't as good as when I saw them the first time. definitely not trying to sound elitist but that's just my take on things."
EmoScreamo,2quff0,Ebays,2,Wed Dec 31 03:04:27 2014 UTC,This is exactly how I feel.
EmoScreamo,2quff0,burnsinthesun,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:25:19 2014 UTC,I'm glad someone shares the same sentiment!! I think it has to do a lot with who they tour with too. knuckle puck was one of the supporting acts on the last tour that they just wrapped up and I just could not get into their set at all.
EmoScreamo,2quff0,Ebays,2,Wed Dec 31 03:56:15 2014 UTC,I saw them open for The Story So Far and The Wonder Years. I honestly wanted to leave right after Modern Baseball played because I cannot stand most pop-punk.
EmoScreamo,2quff0,burnsinthesun,1 point,Wed Dec 31 04:17:27 2014 UTC,yeah most of the scream-heavy/bro-ish/what you would see mid-day at warped tour pop-punk really bums me out hahaha.

EmoScreamo,2qoov6,Theletterz,3,Mon Dec 29 15:16:37 2014 UTC,So I've been listening to this album since high school and I think I can safely say it changed my life. For the better. LET THE FLOOD SWELL.
EmoScreamo,2qoov6,sekihoutai,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:06:58 2014 UTC,Care to elaborate at all? Stories about a  piece of art changing someone's life are usually pretty interesting.
EmoScreamo,2qoov6,sekihoutai,8,Mon Dec 29 23:11:20 2014 UTC,"Oh wow you're actually interested? Weeeeeeellll.... I was in high school. I had just moved to Orange County and to the especially conservative wealthy part of it. Also this was a few years after 9/11. So being afghan, I got bullied. Like a lot. I never knew how to react. I was always trying to joke it off and the few friends I had were never around when it would go down. Basic stuff, get beat up called names. Made me suicidal and infected me with a depression that finally got put to bed a couple years ago. Anyway fast forward to me getting into punk/hardcore and all that jazz. I think it was on purevolume that I started listening to the #12 and was digging through similar artists when I found ctts page. Well they had crowquill and the non-objective point of karma for free download. So I snagged that shit. And it's weird. I listened to those two songs a lot. But always while doing something I guess. I remember it vividly still. We were driving to my grandmothers house and I had just started tn-opok. And something in my head clicked. I was angry. So very angry. I felt like Drew's voice was screaming FOR me. It was a strange sensation. This was the first time my empathy for music kicked in. I had to hold it in because I was in the car with my family but I felt like screaming and crying. I had never felt such rage in my life. It was like I woke up. The next time I was at school I was getting beat on by these two guys who used to torture me for kicks. I remembered the song. I remembered how angry I was. I threw one of them down the bleachers and punched the other one in the throat. No one ever fucked with me after that. Anyway that's the first half of it. The second half started after high school. I joined ctts fansite called the flood. It was here I met other kids from other states and countries and they introduced me to a lot of stuff. A ton of skramz/screamo/punk/diy stuff that led me to make the effort to find more diy shows. Now I book shows with my friends and we take part in socals diy community. I've seen all sorts of amazing fucking bands and met all these cool people. If I had decided to obsess over something else instead of circle I feel like I would've wound up somewhere else. I owe who I am today to ctts and those kids from the flood. Many with whom I still talk to. I will always be so happy that I got into this music even if it does make me sad sometimes. It legitimately saved my life."
EmoScreamo,2qoov6,sekihoutai,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:40:15 2014 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty intense. Sorry you had to go through all of that, I'm happy to hear you're better now! It's always incredible to see how art touches our lives. This is one of the things I love about this genre. All genres have their handful of emotional and relatable artists, but I don't think any type of music can capture what it's like to be human like what I've found in Emo and its subgenres. There are a couple bands outside the genre that do it really well (Modest Mouse, The Smiths, and all of the bands Pat the Bunny has been in come to mind) but Emo is overflowing with them. Thanks for sharing your story!"
EmoScreamo,2qoov6,pylit,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:12:50 2014 UTC,"Thanks! And it's all good. Character is forged in the fires of adversity, you know? And yeah I agree. There's lots of albums from other genres that make me feel them feels but this genre can do it for me without fail. Sometimes I can't even listen to some of it. But I love that. And thanks for listening!"
EmoScreamo,2qoov6,DustbinK,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:40:05 2014 UTC,I saw them live over 10 years ago and I think they're still playing if I'm not mistaken. That's incredible for a band 99% of people will never hear about.

EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,bulkandskull,2,Thu Dec 25 20:04:12 2014 UTC,So stoked to see my friend's band Moonassi play this
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,rockstarK9,1 point,Fri Dec 26 01:58:22 2014 UTC,I was in a band with a member of that band.
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,krispekremy,1 point,Fri Dec 26 09:04:33 2014 UTC,Woah I'm going to he in Austin the 30th too see Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse and now Two Knights on the 31st _^
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,ramonipepperoni,5,Thu Dec 25 15:56:14 2014 UTC,"Stick around for Coma Regalia. Insanely prolific, insanely great Indiana screamo band  Edit: Anodes is also really exciting live. And obviously Ampere"
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,GaryOak69,2,Thu Dec 25 16:02:57 2014 UTC,CR is incredible. Glad to be with them as the two reps for Indiana on this fest.

EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,GaryOak69,1 point,Thu Dec 25 16:17:18 2014 UTC,Sweet how much are the tickets though and do you think it'll sell out
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,MyBrokenVow,3,Thu Dec 25 16:29:36 2014 UTC,Tickets will probably be pretty cheap because it's a DIY fest. I've never been and don't know what kind of space they have so I honestly have no idea if it will sell out. I doubt they keep track of capacity though
EmoScreamo,2qd8oy,CarpetLobster,1 point,Thu Dec 25 16:31:59 2014 UTC,"Sick line-up. Would love to see Moonassi, Flesh Born, For want of..."

EmoScreamo,2qe4rf,seanisdaboos,6,Thu Dec 25 21:28:28 2014 UTC,Thats a very inaccurate FFO.
EmoScreamo,2qe4rf,mrnotloc,1 point,Fri Dec 26 02:47:03 2014 UTC,"Well I can't really picture something sounding like all three. Unless Wicca Phase is different than I think. Bad FFO regardless, but that was my first thought upon seeing this."

EmoScreamo,2qe4rf,daturapiss,1 point,Fri Dec 26 05:58:30 2014 UTC,I liked it. You should put up lyrics though.
EmoScreamo,2qd997,Audio_Visual,2,Thu Dec 25 15:30:34 2014 UTC,"So much emo, screamo, post-hardcore, whatever is filled with fluff.   Fill it with torn up index fingers and vocal chords."

EmoScreamo,2q717w,WuhanWTF,3,Wed Dec 24 07:36:31 2014 UTC,"He gets way too much credit. My favorite band and he is my idol, but it is so unfair how he overshadows the two Steves. And the hook in Never Meant? Wasn't Mike."
EmoScreamo,2q717w,guiltyofbeingdwight,2,Thu Dec 25 12:12:16 2014 UTC,"was at this show and it was incredible. not sure why the ""meh"" reactions. it's american football not fucking Envy or something.  If the crowd looked mellow it was because an entire audience had the same ""holy fucking shit american football is playing live in front of me"" thoughts in their heads."
EmoScreamo,2q717w,Kensham,1 point,Wed Dec 24 16:32:43 2014 UTC,Is that a dig at Envy or just the comparison that Envy is much heavier than AF?
EmoScreamo,2q717w,guiltyofbeingdwight,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:49:36 2015 UTC,envy is much heavier then AF.  the shows have been incredible.
EmoScreamo,2q717w,Kensham,1 point,Thu Jan 8 14:06:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Huge fan of both just wasn't sure if it was a knock on Envy. It's AF though, what do you expect? Its Elliott Smith-esque in the way that its weird to move to."
EmoScreamo,2q717w,keefmastaflex,0,Mon Jan 12 00:15:57 2015 UTC,Very Meh performance to match a very Meh crowd
EmoScreamo,2q717w,Audio_Visual,-2,Wed Dec 24 04:19:04 2014 UTC,To match a very meh band. Even Coldplay sound harder.

EmoScreamo,2q717w,Audio_Visual,1 point,Wed Dec 24 17:41:26 2014 UTC,nice bait.
EmoScreamo,2q717w,Audio_Visual,1 point,Wed Dec 24 18:32:14 2014 UTC,"It's okay for people to not like a band that you like. It's okay even for them to express that opinion.   Personally, I think Don Caballero did everything they did technically but better. And I think a lot more harder screamo bands had better vocals/lyrics."
EmoScreamo,2q717w,Audio_Visual,1 point,Thu Dec 25 15:25:31 2014 UTC,"no it just sounds like you're fishing for reactions in a place which loves american football. you mention that even coldplay sound  ""harder"" while referencing a band which isn't supposed to sound remotely ""hard""."
EmoScreamo,2q6jzk,jonnierios,1 point,Tue Dec 23 15:39:38 2014 UTC,This is beautiful and I'm excited as fuck for their album to come out. Thanks!

EmoScreamo,2q0q9x,stradivari310,2,Mon Dec 22 00:36:04 2014 UTC,This whole EP is great. Hopefully you guys maintain this with the new line-up. Sad this didn't get more hype on here.
EmoScreamo,2q0q9x,DustbinK,1 point,Wed Dec 24 05:11:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I am not particularly worried, since this EP will hopefully pick up steam when the physical release is announced. Also I am super optimistic about our planned follow up!"

EmoScreamo,2pt9hv,charlestylerperkins,3,Fri Dec 19 19:04:41 2014 UTC,"Just started listening to these guys after their tour with TWIABP and Hotelier. Holy shit, their S/T is killer and Too Shabby may be one of the best albums of 2014."
EmoScreamo,2pt9hv,MRGROODCAT,2,Sat Dec 20 01:49:52 2014 UTC,"And they are going on tour the first of the year with You Blew It!, and Tiny Moving Parts. This album will definitely be in the top 10."
EmoScreamo,2poxso,YourFaceIsARapeScene,2,Thu Dec 18 16:06:05 2014 UTC,"Apparently it's true, doesn't make it any less weird though."
EmoScreamo,2pnzkk,onlyxshallow,5,Thu Dec 18 08:17:01 2014 UTC,This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Thank you.
EmoScreamo,2pnzkk,phio666,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:22:54 2014 UTC,I sure hope you bought the Repeater Records repress of it.  I know I did.

EmoScreamo,2ppeh9,YourFaceIsARapeScene,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:28:11 2014 UTC,Yet another French post-rock/screamo band. Quite possibly my favourite genre mix. Thanks for this!
EmoScreamo,2png7f,jamesismynamo,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:17:51 2014 UTC,in terms of 2014 emo i'd say this is third only to The Hotelier and Uchu Conbini (if you call them emo)
