Every now and then one island fucks up financially and then there is a large controversy when they get a couple of million euros in exchange for some extra governance from the Netherlands (neo-colonialism etc.) However, the support they get is less than some larger cities in the NL which fucked up financially.

An euler diagram does not need to show an area for every combination of sets, and can therefore have an unlimited number of sets in it, but none of the areas should ever be blacked out.

Right now the Dutch Caribbean are ""Overseas Countries and Territories"" (OCT) so they are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands but not of the European Union, yet owing to their Dutch nationality, its citizens are citizens of the European Union.  The BES islands will later this year request to be official Outermost Regions instead. The separate countries might some day request this too, but seem to not have decided yet.  Source"

europe,3e2jkr,kmjn,6,Tue Jul 21 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"Lack of recovery from mass unemployment is the main problem, rather than GDP recovery (and also the main cause of social unrest). Italy and Greece have similar GDP growth from 1999, but as a result of the bubble/crash, Greece has a 25% unemployment rate, and a youth unemployment rate around 40%.  It's possible to have an employment recovery with no economic growth, but difficult to pull off. More often, high unemployment persists until an economy starts growing again, at which point it tapers off. Reducing unemployment while the overall economy is shrinking or stagnant effectively amounts performing some kind of redistribution, as you need to keep the same per-capita GDP, but reorganize the economy so that each ""capita"" gets a more equal share of it."

europe,3e2jkr,kmjn,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Greece did in the past, pre-bubble, have ""actual"" employment. It wasn't wealthy, but almost everyone had a job. The main question now is how to get to an economy where most people are working again. Historically economists seem to have only one way to reliably produce that: economic growth. It does not necessarily need to be net economic growth in real terms. For example, if we had our own currency, one standard approach is to devalue the currency, which produces an immediate negative shock to the economy in real terms, then grow back out of that trough. Then employment recovery typically would come in that second ""growth"" phase. It seems very difficult to produce employment growth in a completely stagnant economy, though."

This is why ""spend spend spend"" economics are idiotic: As soon as you have to cut down the unsustainable spending due to it being, well, unsustainable your economy contracts as a result because it was built in a bubble of consistent heavy stimulus. Doing so however cuts down on income, meaning you have to cut even more spending, meaning even more economic recession and so on. Essentially, the economy is going to keep shrinking until it reaches a point where it no longer collapses under its own weight, offering an opportunity to build an actual economy on the ashes instead of some doomed to fail pipe-dream.  Greece especially has made its choice of economic policy years, even decades, ago and as we see now it has turned out to be a horribly bad one. It is up to Greece to fix this situation, other European nations not being willing to fund them doing the exact same thing that got them into this situation in the first place is not the problem at all."

Joining the Euro gave Greece access to very low interest loans, which in turn lead to even less responsible spending and an even higher debt load. In doing so, joining the Euro indirectly worsened the situation because it allowed Greece to heavily increase the debt load and base the economy on deficit spending even more. The reason that the collapse happened when it did is not related to the Euro though, it's because of the banking crisis, which caused Greece to no longer have access to loans to cover previously accumulated debts."

Every day I rage a little bit imagining all that is being stolen from me and my hard work being put in the pocket of some fucking capitalist leech who never understood the meaning of working hard. You love this suicide cult so much why don't I see you applying it to your own country?  They charge high interest because lending is risky. If there is no risk and we are always forced to pay then how the fuck can they morally justify the high interest? Answer me that austerity cultists.

In fact, the only reason why anybody (let's call him X) can ask for ""austerity"" in the first place, is because Greece asks X for money.... and Greece asks X for money because Greece can't ask the market for money. Because market would charge insanely high interests, considering exactly the ""lending Greece is risky"" thing that you mentioned.  Now tell me, if X essentially gives Greece free money (lending below market rates IS ""giving away money""), is X entitled to ask anything in return? Like ""ok, I'll give you money, but let's see how you can come down to a more sustainable spending behaviour, because you're starting to ask too much and this is unsustainable for both of us in the long run"".

If there is no risk and we are always forced to pay    but Greece's effective debt has already been reduced via restructuging to less than 50% of what it was.  Note that debt that has to be repaid in 40 years is worth far less than debt that is repaid in 5 years.

This anti-war painting  is created from cartridge cases taken at the different parts of  front. Unique of its kind and the only in the world mosaic - installation, which depicts the face of a cynical political tyrant Vladimir Putin is the first in the history work of art made in such a technique and style and has a philosophical conceptual meaning:  «It does not matter how the war would be enlighten, and how it would look - it consists of the lives of innocent people.»  This work has an unusual property to change the colour and facial expressions depending on the change of the lighting. Portrait has a set of characters where is possible to see the fate, fear, pride, cruelty and hatred, sorrow and confusion, the willingness to destroy the world (by clicking on the ""button""), or even appear before the judgment of God for their actions. In fact, this portrait represents the emotional diversity of war.  The installation in total consists of approximately 5,000 cartridge cases of different calibres for different types of weapons used on the firing line.  Each element that the portrait is composed of could have taken or have saved a soldier's life, one way or another to be his fate.  The exhibit requires spotlights. The cartridge cases, scattered on the floor, in the amount of 5,000 units are attached to the painting)  Thereby, on the canvas you can see the mystery, full of war energy, consisting of its primary elements: the gunpowder, lead, steel, bronze, brass, copper and zinc, in an amazing combination with the oils and acrylic colours.  The painting encourages everyone who takes up arms to think about the role of the bloody political ambitions in the history of civilization, and that nothing is more precious than human life.

All these bullets were shot with the intent to harm or kill someone and Putin, before everyone else, is responsible for that. Propaganda would be if we'd show something that is not the truth.

I agree up until a point, but what you are talking about (the Tyranny of the Majority) is already happening when we look at Greece. So ultimately the EU does need change, because what you are fearing might happen is already happening; but it's happening outside the EU framework.   In the case of Greece the ""hard line"" is not a bureaucratic anti democratic choice   I disagree, it is Finland, Germany, Slovakia, Portugal (all those ""hardline"" countries) enforcing their will on Greece regardless of the best decision to help the Greeks. Ultimately the Greeks will suffer regardless of what happens, but right now we are giving Greece money so that it can pay off its debt that it used to pay off its previous debt that it used to bailout its banks. This circle of debt is not exactly farfetch'd either. 90% of what they received from the Troika most recently was used to pay off debt so that Greece is no longer in arrears... for now.

It would require treaty change at the least, which requires ratifying and signing by all member/euro nations.   ""Democracy"" as a way to legitimize majority rule is a threat.    Democracy is just a way of deciding who represents and runs a country and makes decisions relating to that country.

Because the current government said it would do X but does Y instead? Because X character in government did Y and they don't like that?  There are an infinite number of reasons to ""not trust"" a democratically elected government.   Democracy is a tool, not an end, and if it is not strongly limited it is dangerous.   As long as the population can see what their elected representatives are doing and the nation stays democratic, the population can remove that government/person from power that they disagree with. This is why democracy is favoured above other forms of government, because democracy is self sustaining.  It's like Winston Churchill said ""Democracy is the worst form of government, it's just better than the rest.""  If a corrupt politician gets elected, and he starts bribing people and getting bribed; next election the electorate can just not vote for him/that party.   and if it is not strongly limited it is dangerous.

europe,3e205l,LimitlessLTD,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:42 2015 UTC,". What institution do you see as having absolute sovereignty?   None, absolute sovereignty is the worse invention of modern times. All of these institutions must of course have severely limited powers.   You realise Hollande can't just ""create"" new institutions right?   Of course. His project is a revival of an old Delors project which in various forms is pushed but federalists. The will to create  new institutions (or to grant more powers to existing ones) is fairly constant in such projects.  As to Churchill's dictum, yes to a point - but the current system of the EU is as democratic as that of member states, and there is little reason to believe that changes billed as bringing  ""more democracy"" would actually carry real benefits. ""More democracy"" is not a good in itself, but again, only a tool.  And the idea that bad governments are driven out is true up to a point - we have specific systems of elections selecting which politicians gain power, and often there is no good choice among those vying for election. This is the case in France as well as in Greece. As you say democracy is just a way to select those in power. This is important, but more important even is to limit those powers, as there is a natural tendency for their increase, which is in the interest of the political class.   If what isn't strongly limited, Democracy? Or the powers that elected representatives get?   The power of those elected or otherwise designated - but democratic designation is a way to legitimize increased powers and as such can be dangerous (as for instance the direct election of the president in France).   I do not really disagree with Churchill's defense of democracy, only with the view that it is good in itself and need no other justification. Democracy is good when it promotes freedom and the rule of law, it is bad when it does the opposite. Also, the broader area a majority rule applies to, the more its shortcomings appear."

europe,3e205l,cute_gorilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:54 2015 UTC,"It depends. Rather than common interest, I would call it common preference. However, in general, all leaders of EU countries have been elected to do the interest of their countries, possibly long term. The legitimacy of the Pan-European interest comes from the fact that I might not like the idea of getting immigrants at home, but if Renzi's pro-immigrant-quotas vote within the EU brings more equilibrium in the distribution of immigrants today and prosperity tomorrow, I WANT Renzi to disregard my rabid racists protests today and go on with his vote for quotas. I might not like it today, but it will save my pension tomorrow, among other things.

europe,3e205l,LimitlessLTD,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"Basically, the number of seats (and hence influence in the vote) in the parliament is not divided based on the amount of money to be paid. Nor is it really based population number. Furthermore, Greece would also be able to vote whatever or not it should receive money. Imagine what their vote will be.   The parliament, which has no power over individual nation finances, would not take enough the individual wishes of each country in their voting. Individual countries would be bullied in an agreement, which they can't agree to.   Let's exaggerate to explain why the majority should not decide over the finances of the individuals: Imagine the EU parliament voting whatever (or not) to let only Germany pay Greece's bill... Well, that could be seen as favorable for everyone but Germany. Still democratically all those other countries could force Germany in it. The smaller countries will can not be neglected in such a way.  What I'm basically saying in the eurogroup an (fair and balanced) agreement between all parties has to be made. While in the parliament it's take it, or leave it.   I agree, with you that a decision by the EU parliament would (most likely) create an 'agreekment' for the whole EU, but in the end we are talking about individual countries with their own politics, wishes and most importantly finances.  As such in my opinion these individual countries should come to an agreement among themselves and not be based on a majority rule."
europe,3e205l,Xeran_,4,Tue Jul 21 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"What you are referring to is called the Tyranny of the Majority, and I have said previously that I want to base a Federal EU on the Canadian model. Here is how /u/lawsimple explains the Canadian model:  In my humble view, voting proportions might not necessarily be the problem with the democratic deficit in the EU. Take Ireland, for example. Voting is heavily weighted in its favour, yet it only has 1.5% of the entire vote. Can any vote be considered just from the point of view of self-determination if the rest of Europe gets vote on an issue that is central to their economic or social existence?  I might propose that we follow the Canadian model.    Central to the Canadian model is the concept of the ""tyranny of the majority"" - i.e., it would be unjust for Ontario (14m people) and Quebec (8m) to vote on how Alberta (4m) should manage its tax system or natural resources. Otherwise, they could obviously tell it to raise its taxes and sell its resources to them at a discount.  No rules apply to the budget policies of the provinces. They are bound only by their electorates and what they afford. At no stage does the federal government tell provinces what they can and can not do with their money. This would be considered undemocratic. (Compare the EU, where the Commission is proposing a power to re-write national budgets, and now inspects budgets BEFORE national parliaments).  All Canadian provinces determine their own tax systems. Some are designed to compete, while some are designed to support large social welfare systems. It’s up to their voters to decide - not their competitors. You will pay PST + GST in B.C., GST in Alberta, and HST in Ontario. (Compare the EU, where these are harmonised.) Corporate tax is decided by the provinces. Rich provinces with lots to offer charge companies more to locate there. Poor provinces with nothing to offer charge less. Most provinces have decided to let the Fed administer their systems, while others have decided to keep theirs - whatever’s best for them. (Compare the EU, which keeps trying to eliminate low-tax jurisdictions like London, Ireland and the Netherlands even though it doesn't even have a competence in that area). At no stage does the federal governement bail-out provinces in exchange for influence in their budgets. Since investors know every province is on its own, the mad imbalances seen in the euro don't accumulate, because investors stop investing in risky banks or governments. Then the province has to reform if it wants to borrow more. If it still manages to get enough credit to go broke, it tells its investors to bugger off - we're a democratic entity and we can vote to default if we want.  Eurocrats often point to Canada, the US and Switzerland as examples of ""Fiscal Union"". None of these countries are fiscal unions. The federal government operates its own programs independently of the Provinces. They might make mutual investments with provinces, like building a certain highway or a health care program, but these are assessed on their merits, like mutual investments.   Canada seems to think that there can be no true democratic outcome where each government's choices are limited by its competitors. I think perhaps they might be right. The EU is already more centralised than Canada/US/Switzerland, and what has it got us? Half of the Euro’s existence has now been spent in crisis. Now economists say Europe's GDP would be up to 17% higher if the euro had never been invented.  Yet look across the water - the crisis STARTED in the US and not a single state was bailed out. Their crisis has been over for years. I love the EU. I want it to stay. But it seems to me that over-centralisation is what got us into this mess.   Just one humble viewpoint. Lots to consider."

europe,3e205l,SkyPL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:20 2015 UTC,"Almost everything you said is false.   (Parliament doesn't count because their main job is just acts a stamp)   Wrong, The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the ""ordinary legislative procedure"" (previously named ""codecision procedure""), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a ""common position"". That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a ""Conciliation Committee"" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.   Because Eu-president isn't actually voted in   Wrong. The European Parliament votes for the European Commission thanks to the Lisbon Treaty of 2009.   it has no accountability to people.   Wrong, they are accountable to the European Parliament.   European council only get to vote on very vague ideology that is supposed to drive decision of next government cycle and get to propose guy to run that ideology.   The Council of the European Union is the most powerful institution in the EU... I don't even know how this is up for debate.  In the Council, government ministers from each EU country meet to discuss, amend and adopt laws, and coordinate policies. The ministers have the authority to commit their governments to the actions agreed on in the meetings.  Together with the European Parliament , the Council is the main decision-making body of the EU.   After this point, elected officials only get to vote, yes or no votes on the actual policy (which matters much more than ideology)   Wrong again. Refer to my first paragraph.   Future more, when people are voting for people who will end up in European council they are voting on national matters, not European matters.   I agree, this entire thread I have been arguing for more powers to the European Parliament and less to the Council of the EU.   Future more, people actually cannot vote based on what they want to happen in Eu-president elections, because they are happening at different point in time.   This doesn't make sense.   This is even more clear when you look at how European Commission actually does it law making, they just keep on pushing laws through until parliament votes yes on them.   They can only ""push"" laws through 3 times, until it is either rejected or accepted. Please go and learn about the European Parliament and the European Commission, they have changed substantially since 2009 (Lisbon Treaty). Your information is very outdated.  That study you linked is from 2006, 3 years before the Lisbon Treaty; which is what changed everything.  Please go and learn about the EU rather than reading outdated ""studies""."

In addition to that, they have consolidated the executive and legislative powers together; a very dangerous combination.  This is dirty politics. And i'm not sure i want any part in it."

Every party presents also a prime minister candidate.  2) The party('s) who got most votes will vote their candidate to become the prime minister.  3) The prime minister chooses other government officials.  How it is in the EU:  1) people go to polls and vote for different parties. Every party presents also a President of the EU Commission candidate.  2) The party('s) who got most votes will vote their candidate to become the President of the EU Commission  3) The President of the EU Commission chooses other government officials.  In reality it works the same way as any other country in the EU, but because people don't care to pay attention to the EU elections and not do their homework on how things work, they like to claim things like some unelected bureaucrats are choosing the EU commissioners."

People elect a party, and the leader of the party will appoint the ministers afterwards, it is rare that it is published who is supposed to be what prior to the election. So in that way, it works pretty much the same way with the commissioner.

The election of Juncker by the European Parliament for the first time under the now enforced Lisbon Treaty shows that gradually the European Parliament is gaining powers and the Council of the European Union and the European Commission are gradually losing them. Which IMO is what should be happening.  I dislike the fact that the most powerful institution in the EU, The Council of the European Union; continues to deflect any criticism and instead aims it all at the EP and EC. When in fact most of the problems we see today (Greece, Immigration, Eurozone sluggishness) can be attributed to the fact that the Council of the European Union holds most of the power but uses it to better their own respective nations rather than benefiting/solving pan-Europeans. The European Parliament on the other hand has a mandate to European Citizens rather than any single nation, unlike the Council of the EU whose members will more often than not favour their own citizens over European Citizens in general."

The MEP's are directly elected representatives that elect the Commission.   Would you defend a system where the house of lords wrote all the laws and Parliament voted on them.    The House of Lords is appointed and not accountable to the electorate in the slightest. The House of Commons doesn't elect the House of Lords at all, but it is instead appointed on a party by party basis. The European Parliament on the other hand directly elects the European Commission. the European Parliaments powers have increased greatly since its initial inception and the ultimate aim of the EU is to make the European Parliament the highest authority on EU issues. See 2009 Lisbon Treaty and the election of the EC. The European Parliament is part of the co-legislative procedure. The Commission does not have sole legislative authority any longer, although that is how it was in the past. See point 2 The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the ""ordinary legislative procedure"" (previously named ""codecision procedure""), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council.

That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a ""Conciliation Committee"" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.

europe,3e205l,misteranf,9,Tue Jul 21 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"When prices for groceries and stuff are a bit higher than in Germany or Italy.   It's funny you should mention food prices in critiquing competition. A lack of competition -- in addition to subsidies -- is the reason food prices are more expensive.  The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funnels a majority of the EU's annual budget into farm subsidies and development. The EU has its' own internal market for food products.     As a result food prices are, on average, ~17% higher than would otherwise be the case -- an unseen tax on consumers. The prototypical case utilized in demonstrating the absurdity of protectionism are the Corn Laws of the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846.     Designed to help support local business and domestic production the Corn Laws (a la CAP) instead increased the cost to consumers and led to a shortage of food supplies; seen in the 1845 Irish Famine -- ultimately killing the Corn Laws.     The EU ought to get rid of CAP which currently acts as a 'double-tax' on consumers (first through national EU contribution, then at the store). Doing so would free up ~50-75% of the EU's annual budget, some ~75b euros. In turn those funds could be spent on regional integration projects (i.e. infrastructure) that are sorely needed. Said projects would serve as a temporary boost to the economy in addition to providing long-term productivity benefits (increasing competitiveness).     You are incorrect, competition is clearly a good thing -- your own example demonstrates that."

Still have a different currency and don't find it inconvenient to switch. Rule of law does not seem as though it has changed in any capacity. Don't know what freedoms you mean, the EU does not make me feel anymore ""free"". Ease of doing business I have no experience with, so it is just an ethereal term to me.

Virtually all of it was closed down and the products were replaced with Western imports.

I guess it comes from people who are afraid to move and projecting their fear into false superiority.  Yes, moving hurts your nation state, but isn't that outdated concept anyway?   P.S.

It has been easy for a left winger to like the EU because the EU defends all the things that we care about.  But the EU is a political institution, and it will naturally oscillate between different ideologies. Suddenly right wing thinking - austerity, cuts, competition - is to the fore.  This comes as a complete surprise to some. Even me, a bit - I am not naive, I know the EU will one day be right wing, but I was surprised by the assertion of national interest and rightwing ideology by countries like Germany and Finland over Greece."

Early EU was about standardizing things that we share together so we could work together etc.  Now EU more and more tries to set policies that some countries don't like and uses bilateral agreements instead of ""let's work together""  For example immigration problem.  For some unknown reason now Poland or Finland ""needs"" to get their share of refuges because EU !! EU !! EU !! EU !! So few nations want to go for quota system and rest don't want that. So those who want quota system are now angry at those who don't.  Like i said. Tug of war instead of sharing things and helping each other.  This is why people don't want federalized europe.

europe,3e205l,mfukar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:56:14 2015 UTC,This is where we don't agree. refugess are not responsibility. They are not citizents of EU nations and only reason why this is problem that grows is that souther nations have shit border security and EU wants to rather fix Italy problem of to many refugess instead of fixing problem aka securing border and hunting human traffickers.  This is why quota didn't work out. Nations want fixes for source of problem not patches. No one would object taking 3k refugess on quota if they would be promised this would be the last batch.  Since there is no fix agreement there is no quota in place.
europe,3e205l,perkel666,3,Tue Jul 21 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"refugess are not responsibility   Refuges are a responsibility. You can't tell them to fuck off, because treats and conventions (which are in turn based on ethic standard I guess) ."

europe,3e205l,mfukar,6,Tue Jul 21 15:27:48 2015 UTC,Thankfully nations don't share that idea.  Either you do immigration right or you have something like France with thousands of immigrants in ghettos from time to time burning tires and cars and sometimes bombing places.

Remember when Poland and other eastern european nations called for harsh sanctions against Russia? Well, Italy and Greece followed suit because of the spirit of ""let's work together"". - Now they need the East's solidarity but I guess that's too much to ask for.    This is why people don't want federalized europe. Because federalized europe means that Germany, UK and France due to Lisbon treaty will be de facto rules of EU and smaller countries won't have anything to say in EU.    That will never happen.

It is EU problem because today Ukraine, next time Belarus and few other smaller nations and suddenly you have Soviet Union 2.0 and a lot more problems for EU.  Also it is Eastern Europen nations that were mostly hit by sanctions not UK, Greece, or Germany. So even if they asked they were the ones that paid the price mostly."

europe,3e205l,mirh,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:18 2015 UTC,Which is why nations who don't want refuge quota say that we should fix problem first then accommodate refuges. Not the other way around.

europe,3e205l,mirh,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:36 2015 UTC,"quotas are nice when you have 40k refuges. Not when you have hole which flows in xxxk refuges every year.  Fixing problem actually is easy. Enforcing borders. Unfortunately it will take few more xxxk refugees in Italy or Greece to finally do something. Those xxxk more refugees will soon melt ""idealistic"" facade of EU govs and they will enforce borders because there is no other way to fix this problem (unless you want to play a war)"
europe,3e205l,perkel666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has changed that much to be honest. It's just that when everything is going good it's easy to convince people to share resources, but when times get tough people become scared and focus more on themselves rather than on the common good.  Taking in a refugee quota is logical, it's part of helping eachother share the burden of refugees. It's either that or provide funds and resources to help peripheral countries strengthen their border controls to reduce the flow of refugees.  Politicians are asshats no matter where they come from, although admittedly some are more corrupt than others. Of course big countries that contribute more to the Union will have more say than small countries, that's the situation right now. Even if Finland was outside the EU, it would be subject to the will of countries bigger than itself. So that argument doesn't make much sense."
europe,3e205l,CastorTrollux,3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"Wait, so, working together earlier was good, but now working together to give shelter to all immigrants is bad?  I'm not sure, if I can follow your logic there."
europe,3e205l,Syl0s,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"working together on agreeable by both parties goal this is the difference you are looking at First of all EU is economical union in first place.  Secondly, you think taking 2k refuges per nation is the end realism dictates those 2k are just beginning unless problem is fixed (aka shitty border controll).  This is why quota system failed. Lack of proper answer for problem not that nations are totally unwilling.  They as of now actually will be taking 36k of refuges including poland just without quota. (original idea was 40k).  And when next time this problem comes (which it will) those nations will ask nations who wanted quota how they can accept next part when problem isn't still fixed."
europe,3e205l,perkel666,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"If you're only gonna work together, if it's agreeable by all involved parties, then you can also just scrap it entirely.  That's not going to happen.  Someone has to accept deficits in one case, and will then receive benefits in the next.  That's how a community works.  And you can't complain about the European Union being wholly bad, just because you right now have to live with deficits.  If it'd be the case that you actually never receive any benefits, then you'd be allowed to complain, but that's just not the case.  Your other argument is a different topic entirely."
europe,3e205l,Syl0s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"this is why there won't be federalist europe, why UK considers bailing out from EU and why Greece problem is such a huge thing. Because there is no EU citizent even if someone says he feels first EU citizent. When problem came (greece) everybody remembered that every law EU mandates is bilateral agreement that can kick you in your ass later (in this case euro)  I am pro EU but not federalist europe, not because it is bad idea but because reality of that idea dictates few things: - it will be forced (because people will never ceade being Pole, German etc first) - without above whenever some deal will be reached over heads of people who will take shot from that deal angry people will want to tear apart EU (which actually happens right now even without federal gov) - which means basically that you will have native terrorism ala IRA and super strong separatist movements that will undermine completely what EU was trying to do in first place."

The moment the Union had to act as an union it became clear that we still have to little in common to work and actually solve a problem together. Ukraine, refugees, Greece - we can't get shit done! I embrace the European idea, but unless we are comfortable with the idea of getting rid of the European Council, the European Union will be just a club where the European leader can haggle about national interests.  Apart from the EU is just the perfect scapegoat for everything that goes wrong. The typical ""thread from the outside that only makes things worse for us!"".  P.S.: I'm still positive towards the EU for a simple reason: The "" European idea"" won't die, and you can't hide from the globalized world. And I think that it would be better if we would keep the achievements that have already been made and fix the problems instead of reverting everything and leaving it to future generations to figure it out."
europe,3e205l,Rarehero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:56 2015 UTC,That seems to be a paradoxical situation where on one hand there are many projects implemented in the eastern part of the EU thanks to the money from the structural and cohesion funds. And on the other hand there are many local people complaining about different directives coming from the EU. Also there is a clash of interests between the EU institutions that supervise the flow of the granted money and local politicians because the money seem to be partially consumed due to corruption in my region. There are significantly higher overhead costs when implementing the structural and cohesion projects for the CR when compared to the rest of EU.

Basically government or private CA issues you X509v3 certificate with personal data you want to be included there (name, tax number, optionally - email, address or phone). It's based on non-standard algo (something similar to ECDSA) and not supported by browsers, so we use some ugly java applets.

No-one recognises Northern Cyprus as an independent coutnry other than Turkey. Plus the UN considers it part of the Republic of Cyprus being under occupation. The Republic of Cyprus (the southern bit) is an EU member state.  Cyprus used to be part of the British Empire and Britain still has some overseas territories located on the island of Cyprus itself.

The territory serves an important role as a station for Signals Intelligence and provides a vital strategic part of the United Kingdom communications gathering and monitoring network in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.""  It covers ~2.7% of Cyprus, so it's a rather large area."

I think delivery companies are going to start switching to ferries for trucks instead, and I'm glad that regulators broke up the company that owned both the ferries and tunnel so they can feel the losses of profit.   Really, we need some more alternatives because the tunnel was supposed to provide a 30 minute, quick trip between France/England and instead it's often 6-8 hours because of massive delays, and despite this they leave empty carriages and don't fill the train in the most efficient way."

In my experience the discussion of the crisis has been evolving at two very different speeds: in Greece people have practically been talking about nothing else for 5 years now. The corruption the crisis revealed shook society to its core and helped topple the two-party system. On the other hand, northern Europeans have only just in the last few months started to realise something's seriously wrong. And of course, now that they have, they're taking the discussion right back to the beginning, to analyse questions like ""whose fault is it?"" that in Greece was dealt with 3 years ago.   So Greeks walk away with the impression northerners just want to play the blame game instead of searching for solutions and northerners walk away with the impression Greeks don't want to take responsibility.

All the Greeks I know knew about this before 2010, much like corruption in Spain and Italy.    northern Europeans have only just in the last few months started to realise something's seriously wrong.   No, they've buried their heads in the sand for the last decade because as has been discussed at length elsewhere the Euro was never about economics only politics; it was a drive to force unification whether it was liked or not. Ever since Maastricht and Lisbon there's been an understanding that the whole thing is intractable and increasingly unpopular but by delaying the hope was that there would be either some ""big"" event that would force the issue or that things would get better.

But everybody seems to have very high opinion of their country and their political class. And the usual revolving doors and stuff like that.  Also their mandatory education has been becoming bad in the last ten years and they seem to be unable to change the voucher system that they introduced due to created interest of for profit schools that offer shitty education and others. They got worse results than Spain in the PISA tests, but then they have over 90% of graduates in high school and our students with better results in independent ranks 75%.   The housing market, specially at Stockholm, is completely fucked up and they seem completely unable to fix it and they have put their financial sector in a stupid position also. If Spain built too much too quickly, Sweden seems unable to build even the normal amount of housing for its needs. NIMBY and lobbies are rampant, let's call it democratic process.   And in Germany  Wolfgang Schäuble was involved in a illegal financing scandal comparable with the one that the Spanish PP has going on and he is the minister of finances.

AFAIK the ECtHR did not recognize a right to family life for same-sex couples and left it to states to define what marriage is. Not sure about other types of unions. Also, it would not be the first time the ECHR jurisprudence ""evolves"" - this is a critique brought by the UK for instance - the ever expanding scope of HR.   Anyway. If the decision says what the title says, it's pretty clear. Every country member of the ECHR would have to recognize some sort of union for same-sex couples. Including Russia and Turkey. Not automatically, of course, but pursuant to very predictable law suits that would follow in each. I doubt, however, Russia would implement such a decision."

I think Malmö serves as an excellent town for e.g. the smuggling of drugs, considering that there are harbour towns all around and with the Öresund bridge providing a quick connection to Denmark. Various international biker gangs got a foothold there and in the surrounding towns in the 1990s. Apart from that, according to the list of (purely criminal) gangs on Wikipedia, there's the ""Brotherhood"" (prison gang), the Black Cobra, ""K-Phalanx"", and ""M-Phalanx"", which all have chapters in Malmö or are based in Malmö. And then there's non-local gangs that operate across borders, e.g. stealing cars.  And of course, since these criminal networks pretty much control all kinds of criminal activities, all this costs the society tons of money. A gang of 15 members that manages to establish itself for 15 years costs society 430m Swedish Crowns (~46m €), if you include the costs for protecting the society (without: 244m SEK / 26m €)."

europe,3e1a5g,viimeinen,2,Tue Jul 21 08:06:25 2015 UTC,"The problem for Russia is that the debt is owed in foreign currency (generally dollars). People are so used to converting currency without a second thought that it's easy to forget that the currency has to come from somewhere, and when you're talking billions of dollars, this can be a major problem.  In the past, Russia has had a supply of dollars coming into the country from their exports of oil, on which the entire Russian economy is dependent. With the dramatic crash in the price of oil, Russia suddenly has a lot fewer dollars entering the country that before. This has been compounded by persistent and significant devaluation of the Russia rouble which make dollars more expensive to buy on international currency exchange markets.  As a result of these factors, Russia has been gouging its foreign exchange reserves to pay their debt. Russia's reserves have fallen from $511bn at the start of 2014 to $388bn at the start of 2015, and they've kept falling since January.

europe,3e1v7j,Kinderhandelaar,7,Tue Jul 21 08:55:23 2015 UTC,"""We are in an interval during the long Greek tragedy, in a gap between the wailings of the chorus but still far from the end, so this is a good moment to ponder one important point about the politics of the eurozone: why do the other 18 members of the single currency accept Germany’s leadership when it is wrong and yet refuse it when it is right? Or to put it another way: if this is a German-dominated Europe, why are the Germans so ineffective at domination?  Of course, this all depends on what you think is right and wrong. What I mean by “right” is the view expressed by Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, that Greece should leave the euro, both for its own sake and that of the single currency itself. And even if you don’t think it is right, it is certainly logical.  The logic of Grexit — whether it is “temporary” or not is mere semantics — comes from the combination of the International Monetary Fund’s analysis of Greece’s sovereign debt burden, which defines it as unsustainable without a big write-off, and the view presented by eurozone countries big and small, rich and poor, which holds that forgiveness of debt by official creditors is incompatible with membership of the single currency.  There is room to argue about whether that last point, that only a leaver can have its debts written off by other governments and official lenders, is necessarily true. But none of those arguing strongly for Greece to be kept in the euro — including France, Italy and Luxembourg, the most vociferous in opposition to the Schäuble line — have addressed that question, at least not publicly. Until they do, simple logic and the arithmetic of debt will make Grexit simply a matter of time.  Having entered the weekend of negotiations of July 11-12 expecting to force Greece out of the euro, neither Chancellor Angela Merkel nor Mr Schäuble can now think that Germany in any sense “dominates” Europe. And yet they have been successful for more than three years now in holding the eurozone to an economic stance that has left the 19 countries’ level of unemployment more than twice as high as that of America.  It is hard to find a better definition of “wrong” than the fiscal pact of 2012, which mandates a universally tight fiscal stance in the eurozone, regardless of whether a country has an affordable level of public debt, regardless of the cost of borrowing and regardless of the state of aggregate demand, and which simultaneously rejects any idea that countries with large current-account surpluses bear any responsibility for adjustment.  This is, in other words, a policy under whose logic America must be seen as having been fiscally reckless in recent years, with its gross public debt exceeding 102 per cent of gross domestic product, and which is shown by its current-account deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP to be suffering a severe lack of competitiveness that evidently requires urgent structural reform and fiscal austerity. The fact that the US unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent is even lower than Germany’s 6.4 per cent is a trifle inconvenient for this argument, but, well, perhaps it is just storing up trouble for the future.  It is this strange combination, of a right policy that is rejected and a wrong policy that is unchallenged, that is giving rise to the risk talked of by the Polish president of the European Council of political contagion from Greece, breeding nationalism all across Europe. Such nationalism, in the form of France’s National Front, or Italy’s Northern League, or even Britain’s UK Independence party, is not characterised chiefly by anti-German feeling, which it might be if Germany were truly dominating Europe. It is characterised by a rebellion against the mainstream parties in each country which have colluded with this bizarre situation.  This very combination offers, however, a way forward. Germany can be given its way on Grexit, in exchange for altering its attitude to the fiscal rules that are throttling the European economy. The funny thing is, this is what the IMF has been arguing for several years, at least in its economic analysis. One day, it might even be listened to.""

europe,3e1v7j,New-Atlantis,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:55:29 2015 UTC,why are the Germans so ineffective at domination?   Because they have no effective means to counter the propaganda machine of the Anglophone media.
europe,3e1v7j,collectiveindividual,4,Tue Jul 21 09:45:49 2015 UTC,The anglosphere is still prone to viewing the EU through an imperial lens fashioned in the Victorian era. From watching US and UK media during the Greek crisis the constant refrain was about institutional failure as if the EU was a federation responsible for domestic decisions of the Greek government. They constantly overlook the fact the Union is voluntary and that Greece was always free to leave.  It's like the UK want Germany to make their case for either staying or leaving the union.

europe,3e27tn,Taure,4,Tue Jul 21 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Two answers that I have found unsatisfactory in the past:  Military power  The argument goes that a unified European military would be significantly more powerful than the current EU militaries, plural.   There is no doubt some truth in this. A unified European military would benefit from significant economies of scale that individual European nations lack. The number of ships, fighter jets etc. a nation buys is often dictated by price per unit, and the more you buy of a single unit, the lower the price per unit. If all Europe was buying a single air superiority fighter, a single destroyer, a single frigate, then the price per unit would drop. Further, development costs would be dramatically cut as Britain, France, and Germany wouldn't be separately investing in the development of redundant technologies. All these savings would mean more ""bang per buck"".  However, the use of ""military power"" as an answer to the question of clout is a problem, for several reasons:   It's not clear by what mechanism a larger, more powerful military makes a nation more prosperous. What would a USE with a powerful military be doing in the world right now, that the EU is not, which would make Europeans richer? A powerful military only leads to greater ""global clout"" if its capabilities are matched by a will to act. Given the diverse and strong views within Europe about the appropriate use of military force (consider Iraq), and even the possession of nuclear weapons, it's not clear if a more powerful European military would actually yield any actions. In short, it's easy to get carried away with the financial savings of unification and underestimate the practical problems of running a single military of a federal state with strong regional asymmetries.  More bang per buck only goes so far in making your military more powerful. Eventually you do actually have to spend the money, and Europe's defence spending is incredibly low. It's unlikely that in practice the savings would be used to expand Europe's military. The more likely result of lower unit costs would simply be reductions in military budgets to maintain the same forces with less money.   Bargaining power  This argument goes that a USE would have the ability to use its ""global clout"" to achieve better terms for Europe in international treaties and international commercial agreements. The example often used is that it would prevent the Russians from turning off the gas.  There are some problems with this:   It's not at all clear what a USE has in collective bargaining than the EU lacks. The EU already negotiates a unified position via the European Commission, so it's not like the current situation is diplomatic chaos. It's not clear by what mechanism this ""increased clout"" works. Why, exactly, is Russia not going to turn off the gas on a USE, if it would on the EU? If it's the threat of military force, see the above, especially Europe's significant reluctance to use military power, and the obvious problem of the Russian nuclear deterrent. If it's the threat of economic sanctions, what economic sanctions could the USE put on Russia that the EU can't (or hasn't)?"
europe,3e27tn,boq,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:29 2015 UTC,"This is a very good question and I'm glad you brought it up. The sub was getting a bit repetetive lately.  I'm just going to rip out some of your phrases and write what I think. Sorry if it's not so coherent, I'm kind of watching chunks of data trickle through my analysis routines.   will to act   This is ultimately the biggest advantage, the coherent will and ability to act. Assuming your hypothetical USE is built like other real world federations, then its individual constituent states will have significantly less control over their federal government in the areas that are under its exclusive power. Nowadays in matters such as sanctions, Europe is basically confined to the lowest common denominator. It cannot force, say, the Italian establishment to participate in sanctions unless they want to participate, limiting the options. A federal government would be much less hamstrung by regional special interests – and if these interests had a point, a federal government would have the ability to balance them. Italy might have to endure more suffering because of sanctions against Moscow, but it could be compensated for it through a single, federal decision-making mechanism as opposed to two dozen ones.   Why, exactly, is Russia not going to turn off the gas on a USE, if it would on the EU?   That's another point: there is no EU whose gas Russia could turn off. It could turn off the gas for individual countries and we know it doesn't want to turn it off for others. Were the EU a country, Russia would only have a binary choice: all or nothing. It raises the stakes to a much higher level. The Kremlin doesn't want to upset Germany too much because it can't afford it. By extension, it most definitely cannot afford to upset German Europeans + 430m other ones.   practical problems (...) of a federal state with strong regional asymmetries   That is another important aspect: the break-up of national voting blocs. Without making a judgement about the issue, let's stick to your example of the Iraq war: Germany as a whole is considered a big opponent of the war. If we look closer we remember how Angela Merkel argued in favour of participating. It was a red-green government with a razor-sharp majority that kept Germany out of it. The idea that there are strong regional differences is strongly exaggerated. Germany was perhaps just a few seats away from joining the coalition. Those few seats made all the difference for the whole country. It's basically FPTP with country-sized constituencies.  Having said that, here are poll numbers from 2003. As you can see, in every single member state there were at least 50% against the war, not that much variation there. In fact, looking at these numbers, I can imagine that a federal Europe might have collectively stayed out of Iraq, which would have not only been the will of its citizens – it might have also managed to convince an isolated US from going at it alone. So, perhaps no civil war and instead, years later, an Arab spring with less sectarian violence. (tl;dr if you don't want a federal Europe, you are literally pro-ISIS scnr :-) )   Europe's defence spending is incredibly low   Well, let's not sell ourselves too short. The EU's combined spending is about half of America's. That's still about a quarter of the world's total spending for a union with 7% of the world's population. America has bases around the world and 11 super-carriers patrolling the oceans at any moment. Even if for practical reasons we might not immediately be able to field 5-6 super-carriers for our current spending, even 3-4 would be a net gain compared to what we have now. Note that I'm not making a statement about the usefulness of super-carriers.   diverse and strong views within Europe   I think a federal Europe would actually appropriate most views of its constituent states. For example, if France has an interest in keeping the peace in Western Africa (for example, to keep the Uranium flowing to its power plants), then so will Europe as a whole. We all don't need or want a collection of failed states across the Med and we also don't want the lights to go out.    Another way of looking at is to hypothetically disassemble existing federations. For example, is Bavaria better off and/or more influential as part of Germany or not? Is it better to be Austria rather than Bavaria? (Personally, I don't think so, most importantly because of the moderating influence of rest-Germany that keeps our crazies a bit in check. But don't tell them, they'd let it go to their heads.)"
europe,3e27tn,h33i0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"One example of global clout is the IMF. Since the Breton woods institutions were setup, the gentleman agreement was that the IMF had to have a European head while the World Bank had an American. The IMF is run by chairs (executive board members). Until 2011 there were 5 stand alone appointments ones, 3 were European.  They added 3 more but its a slight adjustment rather than full reform. The west still has overwhelming control, with Europe being the majority chunk of that.   The power of the IMF is quite evident today as being the major creditor for countries that are undergoing financial instability. It basically became a safety net for bankrupt countries. By giving money to countries we are then able to dictate the reforms they can accomplish and the threat of withholding the funding can be used to coerce as well. Privatization, preferential contracts, opening markets you are competitive in, etc all of these policies which can be used to coerce countries to do what you want. It's never as bluntly done as that, this is were diplomats come in. But you can tie IMF/World Bank money to any arbitrary policy you want them to do. Whether its getting that poor African country to open its nationalised tin mines to (your) competition, or get that Asian country to have elections. These countries will most likely agree as they desperately need the money, in some cases to simply continue existing.  Now this power is currently diffused between all European members, its not collective. UK, France, Germany can do the above but in small amounts compared to the extent that the US can do it. Having a USE would mean centralising this power and having coordinated use of it. I.e. Rather than one european country focused on a policy in west africa while the rest are neutral, it can use the collective centralisation by getting everyone involved in that policy and being able to push it through more successfully.  However, the current fuckups we made in the IMF in the Greek crisis is not helping us. Reform of it (so it looks a little like the real world and not 1945) is stalled in the US and this was compounded by a incredibly eurocentric french leader (Strauss-Kahn). Looking out only for his regions banks rather than the institution itself, he subordinated global interest for the interests of Europe (with one eye on the french presidency) by essentially bailing out the banks with global money. It hasnt been forgotten, and with the likelihood the continued stalled reforms would create, we may see a backlash against our present preferential positions.   About Kahn and the Bank bailouts during the executive director meetings:    Brazil said the IMF loans:  “may be seen not as a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions”.  Iran said it would have expected a debt restructure to be discussed, as did Egypt, which said the IMF’s growth projections were “optimistic”, a word repeated by China.   India warned that the scale of cuts would start a spiral of falling unemployment which would reduce government revenue, causing the debt to increase, and making a future debt restructuring inevitable.   Switzerland was the one richer country which spoke out against the IMF and EU plans, saying: “Why has debt restructuring and the involvement of the private sector in the rescue package not been considered so far?”  It seems incredible that despite such arguments made by its Board members, the IMF went ahead with bailouts which allowed German, French and British banks to escape from their reckless lending/   This was from leaked IMF documents by the WSJ in 2013."

We aren't supposed to do that, we can't, but we also won't need to because the entire population of Africa is simply not coming to Europe.   What the politicians you mentioned are doing also isn't ""voicing something in a dramatic manner"", it's a straight out lie, a fantasy scenario that plays with fear and resentment of a certain part of a population and it's a shitty way with the sole purpose of poisoning public discourse.   So please excuse me for not having the nerve to engage in debates about the same horror scenarios time and time again and just accept that some people are going to call these bigoted racists out for what they are."

Push other countries (Libya, Turkey, Tunisia) to accept said regulations as well.

The illegal immigrants had to spend a year's savings to get a boat trip from Africa to Italy.  This isn't the US-Mexico border where you can just take a few hour car trip or a day's hike to cross."
europe,3dzoye,jtalin,5,Mon Jul 20 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"That is the case currently, because they know they'll most likely get to stay if they survive the trip.  The whole ""economy"" based around transporting people will adapt if Europe undertakes a different approach. The fact that these people are prepared to spend their life's savings and risk death to cross over should make it abundantly clear that they're not going to be deterred by deportation.  What exactly are they going to do with their lives once they're ""deported"" (to... somewhere, we don't know where yet)? They pretty much have a choice between trying again and trying again."
europe,3dzoye,Shiningknight12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:14 2015 UTC,People will risk death and spend their life savings on the promise of salvation. They won't do it for a few months in a holding cell followed by deportation to their home country.

Also, they would not be deported to their home country. We don't exactly know where they would be deported, and that's just one out of numerous issues with this completely dysfunctional proposal.

I am sure someone will come and suggest we tow them to international waters and block them from re-entering. And I'll answer preemptively, one of those boats (if you can even call them that) will eventually sink, hundreds of lives will be lost, international outcries will put pressure and this strategy will be abandoned.

Unfortunately, almost all of Africa would be better off in Europe and the source of illegal immigrants is, for all intents and purposes, limitless.

The refugees we do take, I expect to leave when their country is safe again, say thank you for the food, shelter, education, etc and bring their newly found western ideals back to whence they came. In this case it is a great opportunity to spread tolerance and knowledge.  However my fear is that as the economy become more automated, the work that uneducated young men can provide will be worth less and less. Then what do we do?

IMF said in order for them to take part, the debt must be sustainable (haircut/restructure/something)  But the EU refuses to talk about debt restructuring (haircut is off the table) without Greece making the reforms first.  But most of the reforms need time to be legislated. Greece is snap-passing every law dictated that they can get through quickly, but many ""reforms"" (example: ""find equivalent of X% and cut"") is unreasonable to assume it can be found in a few days.  So a ""bridge"" loan was given to stave of the first wave of payments. But the situation is getting worse. See, the bank closures hurt the economy really bad. And while this is continuing the situation is degrading.  So with EU and IMF are at an impasse, the Greek economy in shambles and the left ""anti-austerity"" government trying to pass what is considered the most recessionary measures since the start of the crisis, a government which sacked some members of their party and had to do a cabinet reshuffle, time is running out.  There is no way that we'll hold till ~October (that's about when people speculate that the evaluation of the reforms will take place).  So in essence, a TL:DR, EU wants IMF in the bailouts, doesn't currently want debt restructuring. IMF wants debt restructuring."
europe,3dyrx3,Anergos,11,Mon Jul 20 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"That is what some of us have been wondering, with ever-increasing incredulity.  But there are lots of especially Germans on /r/europe who are completely against forgiving enough Greek debt for the plan to have a chance of working. Try asking them - they will say that IMF is wrong, or that the plan can work if it wasn't full of Greeks, or that they will not give any more money. Never mind that it is obvious that the debt will not be paid back anyway, any rational person would consider the money already lost.  It seems to be some kind of ""moral"" argument against loan forgiveness, though it also has lots of denial. The Greeks have to suffer for being irresponsible and uppity. And by making Greece a living hell, they insure that nobody else will have the timidity to default, never mind that the main responsibility for responsible lending is traditionally put on the creditor (=e.g. German banks). And never mind that pain and huge cutbacks which have already taken place is surely deterrence enough by any reasonable measure. About all the suffering young unemployed Greeks (50% youth unemployment) who had no responsibility for creating the debt in the first place, I don't know.  My impression is that the media has been fanning the flames with talk about stupid and lazy Greeks. I wonder what the politicians really think, if they know how ridiculous this whole thing is and are just playing for votes in national elections by being ""responsibly tough"" on the Greeks, or if they genuinely are thinking their plan is optimal."
europe,3dyrx3,Thue,7,Mon Jul 20 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard debt restructuring is conditional on reforms like and independent statistics bureau, which is not unreasonable to ask for.  I would want to know how the money is being spent and its effects."
europe,3dyrx3,anabis,8,Tue Jul 21 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with the ""independent statistics bureau"" is that it's not really independent.   They head of Elstat is currently under investigation by the Greek law about fudging the debt stats in order to prompt the bailout packages during the start of the crisis.  He is also under charges about holding another job while he was in Elstat. A job in the...IMF.  There have been further allegations that Elstat is being ""influenced"" by Eurostat.  So it's not simply making an independent from the government statistic bureau but making a truly independent statistic bureau. Which let's be honest, even if a new ""elstat"" was to be born, or all the members of the old elstat were to be sacked, what people will fill those positions? You'll be hard pressed to find people with no connections to...""outside"" or ""inside"" influence.  A TLDR: EU want's a government independent statistic bureau, Greece wanted (not that it matters but anyway) a statistic bureau free of outside influence."

He is also under charges about holding another job while he was in Elstat. A job in the...IMF. There have been further allegations that Elstat is being ""influenced"" by Eurostat.   This is fascinating. So there is a narrative in Greece that the previous statistics bureau was under a different influence.  What is said to be the motivation for the previous head in prompting the bailout?  The IMF as a whole (which includes US and Asian countries, btw.) were reluctant to get involved in the Greece crisis."
europe,3dyrx3,anabis,3,Tue Jul 21 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"What is said to be the motivation for the previous head in prompting the bailout?   He's still head of Elstat. There is no official reason listed in the charges, mostly speculations. Examples, here's a Varoufakis quote:  ""When the whole world assumes that Greek statistics are always going to under-estimate the budget deficit, changing this reputation and impressing the world that things have changed meant one thing: getting it right or, since statistics can never be precisely right, issuing predictions that err on the side of over-estimation.""   Though Varoufakis believes it's a witch-hunt and while he might have been overzealous, it was not to that extend to warrant such moves.  But that's the most generous one. Others - circulating from within Elstat, from the union themselves. About him being a man of the ""creditors"", with the goal of promoting austerity measures across the periphery or somesuch. One of the accusers was working within Elstat.  There's some rumors going on that the large charge (fudging the numbers) has been dropped yesterday but the second charge (working with the IMF at the same time, which I believe constitutes a conflict of interest) still standing."

This is again apologism and rationalizing, statistics always works within reasonable margins, since of course predictions are just that. But having them fail miserably to the advantage of one party is either incompetence or ill intent."

Honestly, i simply trust that my government, and most other governments in the eurozone, have a lot more infos on everything than we do.   Why do you think so?

This, and Greece's bankruptcy, was what killed its economy.  Furthermore, Greece's economy was driven by the massive amount of loans that the greek state had to continuously borrow just to keep the economy inflated.  Once the loan tap ran dry, naturally the economy deflated.  Furthermore, your ""piledriver"" actually was responsible for ending the greek recession, and lead to the historical achievement of getting the greek state to reach a primary surplus.  I don't understand the level of blissful ignorance and absolute fascination for absurd conspiracy theories that drives people to try to pin the symptoms of Greece's problems to the reforms put in place to finally fix them."
europe,3dyrx3,BarneyFranc,10,Mon Jul 20 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Greece was never out of recession. The unemployment and debt were constantly rising over the last five years reaching their peak this year. Running a primary surplus is not the definition of ""ending a recession""."

europe,3dyrx3,BarneyFranc,6,Mon Jul 20 21:52:08 2015 UTC,"saying that Greece has economic growth (the economy is down by about 25% compared to 2010) is like saying that somebody is living a healthy lifestyle because he went from 200 pounds to 300 and for a month back to 290.

It matters nothing that the GDP grows if this so called growth ir artificial and kept with borrowed money, particularly when the currernt government claims they cannot possibly repay it.  Don't you understand this is the very definition of unsustainable?   What is your data to back your claims up?   Have you been living under a rock for the past decade?

One of the landmark cases of the US Supreme Court on immigration anticipated this sort of thing exactly.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind    (1923)  Guy came over here, served in the US Military, became a citizen (and had it revoked) over and over again, finally appealed to the Supreme Court.  Their logic was that:  1) though he was Caucasian in an ethnological sense, the common person in the United States wouldn't understand something like the nuance of Indo-Aryan vs. Dravidian, and wouldn't care - - he's a brown guy from another country, not ""white"" in that sense, and therefore, not eligible for citizenship  2) Furthermore:    It is a matter of familiar observation and knowledge that the physical group characteristics of the Hindus render them readily distinguishable from the various groups of persons in this country commonly recognized as white. The children of English, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian, and other European parentage, quickly merge into the mass of our population and lose the distinctive hallmarks of their European origin. On the other hand, it cannot be doubted that the children born in this country of Hindu parents would retain indefinitely the clear evidence of their ancestry.    It is very far from our thought to suggest the slightest question of racial superiority or inferiority. What we suggest is merely racial difference, and it is of such character and extent that the great body of our people instinctively recognize it and reject the thought of assimilation.     I was born and raised in the United States.  I grew up in a rural part of Appalachia. I like guns. I dislike taxes. I dislike it when immigrants ('specially the illegals) won't learn English. Etc.  I'm politically a product of the cultural vogue I grew up in.  Yet many times, I am assumed to be foreign simply by my appearance alone.  I dated a girl from the Czech Republic in college.  Guess who people on the street thought was dating an international student?  Race does matter for assimilation, and part of it is tied up with who you'll be able to date and reproduce with eventually.  For instance: It was always really hard for me to get a date in highschool, despite the fact I was born and raised in the same community as everyone else.  Much, much easier in college, particularly with girls who were from non-Anglophone countries that didn't have a lot of Indian immigrants in them. Effectively, I was a racial unknown, but I was not a  known racial ""other"".  Don't even get me started on what it's like being an Indian/Asian male trying to date Indian/Asian women.  I'm sure if she and I got married and had kids, the offspring of that union, having a slightly lighter skin tone than myself, would deal with far fewer racist comments, and have an easier time than I did dating, and be less readily assumed to not be American.  That's just how it is.  It's not a crazy concern for OP to have, though their phrasing may have been clunky, and their notions about what constitutes ""Good"" immigrants off the mark from those features that actually encourage assimilation."

It's just that most white girls like white men, middle-eastern girls like middle-eastern men and black girls like black men.

If I were you and if what you're saying is true (and you don't just simply have too high of standards) I'd try to get a Middle-Eastern gf online, make sure she is Atheist and invite her over to the UK.

Have you asked some of the women you have dated for a deadly honest answer why it seems so difficult for you?  Now for the rest in the Netherlands: Marriages especially between middle-eastern men and native women have a very high chance of failing within 10 year. The middle eastern often don't mix and seek a partner from their own ethnic group, however they like to practice on ''whorish'' natives. Only 1 in 20 of this group will seek a native partner, this is very low and any other ethnic group is higher than this. There are bad stereotypes off course, many with a core of truth.

Their main complaints are to rescind a government executive order that gave the terrain for nothing as an exchange for a similar action by the Turkish government in order to build a Romanian church in Turkey. They (Facebook page) want an open discussion with the citizens of Bucharest about building this mosque.   On the other hand why build it there? I'd  doubt there are more than 1.000 practicing muslims in Bucharest. A more natural choice would be Constanța,  but they already have mosques for their small tatar minority. The point being that the Muslim community in Romania is shrinking as far as I remember the last census results. We are not a refugee friendly country because of lack of benefits or adhesion to Schengen and this all looks like a friendly deal between the current  PM Victor Ponta and his ""good friend"" Erdogan because he lacks any other foreign allies and shady businesses are suspected between the two.

ISIS used to be the lunatic bad guys that operated outside of our borders. The average Turkish person was concerned, but most people didn't see fighting a threat outside of Turkish borders for the price of Turkish lives to be reasonable. While most people were enraged when AKP's prime minister hesitated to call ISIS a terrorist organization or when a Turkish newspaper revealed how trucks were operating across the border to aid ISIS with weapons and health supplies; AKP's voter base tended to act apathetic rather than supportive.   How do Turkish people view ISIS before this incident - and what is the media saying now.   Except for a delusional extreme minority Turkish people are completely against ISIS, for obvious reasons. The government is trying to aid ISIS secretly to keep from angering masses -- because they are genuinely Islamist cunts who see ISIS as ""brothers misbehaving"". There's a reason why they were very careful about not leaking the information though, their voter base definitely isn't unanimously behind this decision -- most of them are just ordinary people hoping for a stable government and nothing else. Kinda like Putin's voter base.   Really interested to understand why ISIS did this when they have had turkish support.   They didn't. Although the ones that did support them will keep doing so as the attacked were socialists. The average Islamist will still be behind them without a doubt, considering how they are disgusting enough to celebrate an incident where a hotel many Alevi intellectuals stayed in for a conference was burned to the ground in 1993 by extreme Islamists.

Iran, currently, has Hezbollah in Lebanon which plays mostly a reactive/defensive role against israel (note their invasion of the country in 2006). Apart from that they have some shia militias in Iraq of significant strength which have mostly been bolstered for the fight against IS.   The Houthis in Yemen? they're entirely autonomous from Iran but are certainly supported and perhaps - in parts - dependent on them.  I'm not saying that Iran doesn't have major strategic interest in the middle east to the detriment of other nations (Israel + Saudi Arabia namely) but they're not supporting any militias which have started an inordinary amount of wars."

They also undermine the Lebanese state and turn Lebanon into a partial Iranian vassal.  And the Houthis are just as autonomous from Iran as the Islamic Front and FSA elements are from Saudi Arabia/Turkey, which is to say they are in reality an Iranian proxy. There's really no way to reconcile this unless you're going to accept the Saudis have no role in Syria, which is obviously untrue.  The opposition in Bahrain is in large part also backed by Iran. A lot of it is organic and genuine political opposition to an authoritarian regime, but a lot of it is also simply regional Shia vs Sunni power politics.  Iraq's most numerous and powerful fighting forces are explicitly trained, armed, and openly loyal to Iran. This has been the case since 2003 and Iranian-backed, trained, and organised militias control the vast majority of Iraq oftentimes under direct IRGC leadership. Some of these militias like the Mahdi Army attacked the Iraqi government regularly and operated death squads that killed Sunnis, which lead to a lot of the Sunni resentment today that's feeding into ISIS's hands.  Of course, there's also Assad... who is being propped up almost entirely by Iran and its proxies.  Their hands are not clean at all, and it's pretty hard to make the case that their behaviour in the region is in any way better than Saudi Arabia's or Qatar's."

With it, you've got your soldiers in virtually every corner of the earth and have the assistance of the major developed nations on earth and, last time I checked, SACEUR has never been a non-American general.

European nations benefit from that power projection in the form of the umbrella protection it provides as well.   There hasn't been a single American NATO Secretary General and just a single Deputy Secretary General.   You can call it American imperialism all you want. You lot aren't getting nothing out of it.

I am only talking about those cases not the inevitable illegal crossings. Also, I am talking about letting terrorists cross INTO Syria. Not back into Turkey. They're a lot stricter with that. Understandably so. But they've failed to grasp the fact that being lenient with people (anyone but Kurds) entering Syria will eventually come back to haunt them because 9 times out of 10 they're terrorists.

The point is not to have the EZ contribute to a country's unemployment benefits as a rule, but to offset the costs when they reach an unmanageable level. E.g. have it kick in when unemployment reaches a certain threshold (say, between 10%-15%). These things are less permanent than they may appear; E.g., Poland's unemployment is currently about ten percentage points lower. Some countries may be net beneficiaries and some net contributors even over extended periods of time. That's normal for risk pooling systems. The net contributors still benefit from not having to deal with the side effects of fiscal shocks or only with less severe ones.    Even more so how is the sum set when wages and incomes are in completely different levels depending on nationality?   That'd be down to the actuaries to hash out.

Some people may think that it's because they are muslims too, but that's certainly not the case because these people are amazingly different from the Turks. They speak completely different language, they use arabic while we use latin alphabet, they hold sectarian views(like they refuse doctors from Alavi background but Alavis make %20 of our population). Turks have much more similar culture with Greeks that with Syrians. It's problematic, I wish it was not like this but it's definitely not apocalyptic. Definitely not worth to leave these people to the mercy of warlords.  And about the economy thing, I'm completely with you. People are missing the point of what makes a country productive and are looking for a magical solution. People who advocate for Grexit, especially Krugman, don't put into account from what Greek people will have to go through and how much human capital they will lose in the process and the trauma that the society with carry for generations. Sharp devaluation of the currency will hit people who live from paycheque to paycheque so hard that will create all kind of social problems, even if the economy eventually bounces back the thing that people will have to endure would make the austerity like winning the lottery.  It's just crazy that this kind of rhetoric gets popular. People talk like if Grexit happens tomorrow, the day after it cheap high quality Greek made automobiles will outsell the German automobiles and revive Greece."

In any case I'm sure that's quite different to our position and so that comparison and therefore the comment of yours is completely useless.  For real comparisons, and although we have our differences, you should probably make them to Sweden, which is outside of the Euro."

The main reason the UK coped so well with the crisis was precisely because we are not in the Euro too. Unless the EU can fix its structural problems I'm not sure this stagnation is going to end any time soon. Heaven forbid we have another financial crisis, it will be the end for the EZ."
europe,3dzlwr,Ewannnn,8,Tue Jul 21 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"As to whether the ability to devalue its currency would help deal with the current economic downturn, Mr. Stubb is similarly skeptical. “Devaluation is a little like doping in sports,” he said. “It gives you perhaps a short-term boost, but in the long run, it’s not beneficial.”   Jesus, the economic illiteracy and ideological obstinacy of our European elites is truly breathtaking. Europe, I fear for you."
europe,3dzlwr,wontanyonelookatthe,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:27 2015 UTC,"Why? Currency devaluation is not an effective solution for advanced economies. We're too globalised, interconnected. If country X prints money, then country Y and Z can do the same and the exchange rates essentially stay the same.  Another logical fallacy is to assume that countries are structurally equal and devaluation can give countries an edge. Devaluation just helps to hide problems a few more months or years.  Each asymmetric shock in the EZ area is making countries more similar - that is, weaker countries are forced to reform to keep up with stronger members (""turning everyone into germans""). This is making the EZ stronger and stronger over time."

The point here is that the Greek state didn't make them pay and still doesn't, even though it's not ruled by the corrupt Neo-Democratia or the PASOK any more.

On the one hand no explanation for German  economic (and since the introduction of the euro, political) supremacy other than German virtue can be entertained, and any reference to structural factors are met with whining.   On the other, sweeping generalisations about southern European laziness, dishonesty are considered good material for caricatures and jokes.  Macroeconomic arguments are breezily dismissed with Swabian housewife arguments (though this may have more to do with the state of the discipline of economics in German universities than anything else.)  No one seems to be aware that no money has been given by German taxpayers to the Greeks.  A very basic point, but one that has been lost completely.

Increasing what you take in is not easy and most ways that lead to more revenue actually cost money to implement. Greece doesnt have money though. So they need to cut costs and hope the reforms that they can implement without spending money will stimulate the economy.   Important to know though is that austerity is not supposed to really lead to growth while it is being implemented. Its only goal is to foster more and sustainable growth once they are done implementing. Until then the EZ gives Greece really cheap loans (cheaper than they had before, effectively being debt relief) and gives it more and more time to actually repay them. The EFSF loans start being due in 2023 and the earliest loans by EU countries start being due in 2020.   edit: added a short bit about loan repayment."

Your reply touches the same or similar principles which make a lot of sense. However, most if not all of what I read and/or sourced from economists well-versed in these matters have been very critical of the general notion that cuts in government spending and tax increases has never been productive and in most cases (as far as  they can accurately assess these things) have done the exact opposite of what they were meant to do.  I did look up Mark Blyth and stumbled on several articles that reiterate what most economist have long agreed on. Also, --/u/weneedtofederalize --   ideology is not something to ""understand"" it's something to believe. Marc Blyth is just stroking dicks of the left/wishful thinking.    When reading on Marc Blyth, nowhere did it strike me as idealist bull. Everything I found so far has been thoroughly researched and still couldn't be kind to the damage austerity has inflicted.  Just now I stumbled on a piece that neatly summarized what I've been hearing and reading about. I haven't come across a compelling piece that successfully made the case for austerity.  *Edit: grammarz"
europe,3dxn7r,Sjimsjimsheree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"To explain that ""idealist"" comment (even though it was rude), you have to look into the different economist schools. The two most famous are Keynesian and the Austrian school. There are lots of schools that think (sometimes drastically) differently how the economy works and what makes it tick. Thats where the idealist comment comes in, cause we dont know who is correct. Keynesian is the most famous of them all and the school that famous people like Krugman subscribe to. But we still dont know if the Keynesian school is actually correct.  I also am a supporter of the Keynesian school of thought, same as Krugman. So I agree with him. But the Keynesian school never actually says that austerity is bad all the time. The simple difference is that in the Keynesian school of economy austerity is supposed to be done during boom times, as the money that is being taken out of the economy by the state will more quickly be replaced by private money resulting in less suffering by the populace. That much to start of with. The problem that I have with Krugman's train of thought is that he either wants Greece to spend itself through the recession (which is the best way) or default and leave the Euro. They are very much researched ways to get out of a slump. And they tend to work. The problem with both ways are the following:   Greece cant spend itself through the recession as they are bankrupt. They do not have the money to do so. And expecting other European states to do so on Greece's behalf is very unrealistic. Default is not going to be pretty. Especially not in Greece's case. It would get much more ugly than it currently is. This would btw still result in austerity, but this time it would be austerity they could not choose. They would only be able to pay for as many programs as they have money. The advantage is that they could take time (after the first few years) to increase their export industry and they will be forced to at least work through some of the systemic problems that they are facing. There will be nobody (the ""Germans"" as it is in many a mind) to remind them to change stuff, but for them it will be ""do it or face hunger, as you are bankrupt and nobody is going to help you but yourself"".    Another problem with default is that it means Greece would leave the Euro at best and the complete European Union at worst.  (this is only a problem if you care about either, I guess) Krugman has different priorities than a European might have. He is a very politicized American economist.   As I mentioned above, austerity, in the Keynesian school, is supposed to be done during boom cycles in order to ""soften the blow"". But as I mentioned above, default also has the same effect, but much quicker and in a forced way. So what the austerity policy of the EZ aims to do is a middleground. Get the needed reforms and cuts in place in a way that is not as harsh as a fullblown default, as the other states are paying for the deficit that Greece is still occuring. (in a default, as said, Greece would be at an immediate +/-0 because they literally wouldnt be able to get money from anywhere). The problem with this approach is that it takes more time, prolongs the suffering (though it is not as bad as a default) and the creditor states are not as successful a ""reminder"" of the urgency of the reforms as a default is. The ""sense of urgency"" of both is not the same exactly because the suffering of the populace is lessened.   Disclaimer: The first part is mostly about the keynesian school, but the second is simply my reasoning, so take it with a pinch of salt, but its simply what makes sense for me and my completely different priorities. Im only a student of economy, not a full-blown legend like Krugman."

For the record Schäuble is a hack and Merkel used his ignorance to full effect, I doubt we'll be seeing him in quite the same way from now on (assuming Greece holds up its end of the deal, a big if...). As for the ideological argument, economy is a social science, not a hard science. The predictive value of economics is very limited. I still vividly remember hearing economists making all sorts of ""authoritative"" statements when the crisis broke in 2008 and all of them failing the next day. As far as I can see economics is partly the study of the exchange and distribution of goods etc. and mostly the science of how to take models out of their intended context and overfitting them to satisfy people's need for a sense of security. I honestly think a moderate ideological policy is worth at least as much as a policy based on the predictions of economics."

It's the same idea driving the whole austerity-program in the first place. The idea of retribution. ""We want our money back!"" Well sorry, but the money is gone.

In fact, investing in bankrupt businesses is hugely popular, albeit often enough for rather nefarious reasons.

Back in 2012 Global entities like the IMF (leaks) and Standard and Poor's were vocal that Greece needed at least a 70% hair cut on their debt.  Instead, the eurogroup bought the debt from their banks at a hefty premium for fear that their own banking systems would collapse. So, had the eurogroup never bought Greece's debt, Greece would have less debt today and be in a better situation.  Greece's debt commitments went from about 350B to 330B, which is hardly a 70% reduction.  The eurogroup should have never bought the bank's risky bets and should have done what the US did, which was loan the money directly to the bank's and force them to pay it bank."

Ethically, it's arguable if the VAT for tourism should be maximum or not. But if you are going to make it maximum, there is not one single good reason to increase the VAT 17% at once; it's so stupid and so damaging that all possible extra income through VAT will be completely nullified by the reduction in GDP due to the economic impact of the increase.  This is just ONE of the good conditions.  Imo, it would have been a better idea to fucking solve shit for once by attacking the brutal inefficiency of the Greek state, restructuring the loan and investing on the greek economy, instead of another round of loan extensions and austerity fucking the economy. But northern europe voters wouldn't support their governments in helping greece, they want Greece to be punished. Specially Germans can't seem to remember what happened when they were punished after ww1 and why they were helped after ww2, after a war they started and at a moment that out of every country, Germany was the least deserving of help and aid.   But hey, maybe it's a better idea to dump greece and let them fall to the unpredictable. With ISIS establishing in the balkans, the far right gaining power and probably gaining support each time the left fails to deliver, Putin power-grabbing everything and Erdogan salivating over writing his name in history, I'm sure it's a great idea."

europe,3dxn7r,VERTIKAL19,3,Mon Jul 20 13:28:13 2015 UTC,"VAT is one way to increase state income.   True, but as I said: any increases in state income are nullified by the decrease in gdp, usually having the opposite of the desired effect: increasing the debt-to-gdp ratio. read the first two paragraphs of the wikipedia definition of austerity for more info (note that this is estabilished in most economy textbooks and backed by decades of hard data - Varoufakis said this, Krugman said this, every economist with a little of credibility says this). The countries who implemented heavy austerity and are supposedly recovering are big cover ups; only a couple macro-economic indicators have actually recovered and not to pre-recession levels. When the next recession hits (and it should in the next 6-24 months), the economies in these countries will be weaker than it was when the last recession hit and the economy will suffer much more. When the next recession hits, Italy, Spain, Portugal and probably France and the UK will suffer a lot.   You can't just give out money for free. How should you justfiy that?   You can, and sometimes you must. The price of abandoning greece is greater than the price of saving her, whatever it may be. But the way we must do it is by actually demanding responsibility from the greeks, involving them in recovering the country, make it a national effort through good pr but fucking do it at helping ending the inneficiency problems and corruption problems. If you go there to punish them/just make sure the debts are paid, like the troika did in Greece and Portugal, they will be bitter and angry at troika. It's a basic lesson from history and politics: either you go full budha and you help your ""enemy"" and integrate him and treat him as equal or you completely destroy them. The ""middle ground"" will just create bitterness for everyone. Germany in ww2 and ww1 is just a good example of that lesson and a time when we just gave away money for free.

I believe that's why the demand for a higher VAT was made in the first place; as there is the (founded) belief that the Greek Tax Agency is unable/unwilling to collect energetically on the other kinds, dropping the effective tax rate of those due to non-enforcement.   If the income, property and other such taxes were to be collected as should be, it could allow for future reductions of the VAT instead of a reliance on it."

Yes, reforms were needed, and if Greece's GDP hadn't shrunk by a third they'd be the most fiscally responsible country with the highest balance surplus currently in the EU.

europe,3dxn7r,Hematophagian,24,Mon Jul 20 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"About the land registry, I'll chime in because I know a couple of things.  Greek land deeds are old. There has been no land redistribution and Greece is pretty mountainous. There in lies the problem of the land registry. In cities, it's pretty easy to implement and it has been done.  But in the periphery, it's no easy task. Imagine having a deed - and I shit you not, that's exactly the form of many if not most of the deeds - that describes the land borders like this: The property extents from the road down the creek, it follows the creek till it reaches a rock then goes southwest till it reaches the hill and...etc.  The properties are seldom well defined or square. So in such events you'll probably have to send an engineer or what-they're-called to make actual measurements. Then you'll need to take into account the disputes, have witnesses, possibly court actions and so on.  Most of these places aren't reachable by car. I mean, mine isn't. We had to use satellite photos, which was very helpful for people that are somewhat used to ""reading"" photos.   But ask a 60-70 year old to pinpoint his land from an airplane/satellite photo and things get complicated really fast. That's without even considering what I've mentioned, a ""greedy"" neighbor disputing the assertions."
europe,3dxn7r,Anergos,5,Mon Jul 20 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"And? Of course it is not easy to implement such reforms and install necessary authorities and legislatures. Greece has to close a gap of decades in some fields, and they have to do it in a couple of years. That won't be easy. It will be complex, it will piss of some lobbies, it will lead to many, many court cases, but it has to be done. No one expects Greece to do all that in three years, but so far the Greek governments have done almost nothing to get this process even started.  Tell Tsipras to ask the EU for financial means and the help of specialists to get these things done! We would be happy to help."

And the person responsible was a cousin of mine who knew my lands. (They sent a person knowledgeable to each village to facilitate)   But it's not complete yet. And I doubt it will be anytime soon from what I've experienced.  People need to repatriate, the courts have two years+ wait time etc.  I don't know if they can streamline the process.

It is a) not that difficult to measure mountanious lands and with todays tools it is a pathetic excuse b) we have really old deeds, as do the other nations as well, so that is a pathetic excuse as well. Heck, my family have deeds from 16th century. In particular Sweden, Norway and Switzerland there hasn't been that many wars that has burned the registry either c) it certainly doesn't take more than 20 years, since Greece received money for it in 1995.   Mountainous areas are impossible to define from satellite photos without elevation maps.   So, why didn't Greece make them in 1995.    Maybe they did it over a span of several years.    Of course we did and Greece should have started it decades ago, and received money for it 20 years ago, from the EU, but didn't start. So, it is Greece's fault that there is no land registry.   The problem is that the Greeks haven't bothered to implement it until now and now they come up with the most silly excuse I've ever heard.

europe,3dxn7r,kairho,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to the parts of the second bail-out programme that were implemented and those that were not for whatever reason. Not everything was that fault or the failure of the Greek government. For example it is hard to tackle black labor and transactions that are made ""around the system"" (meaning the authorities cannot tax them because they don't see them) when people are already have a hard time to make a living and are happy about every Euro they can make and/or keep. Two or three years ago the Eurozone should have probably realized that the work relationship with the Greek government and the overall plan isn't working anymore because they have underestimated how deep the structural problems in Greece are, and they should adjusted their strategy in respect to Greece and ensure the implementation of all reform. Anyway, the point is that contrary to the public narrative the second  bailout programme was not just about cuts and tax raises but also about useful and necessary structural reforms (that would have helped the people).  Just look at the banking system. Many people can only access their bank accounts through the counters. They don't have access to ATMs or online banking (heck, even my Mum has been doing onlin banking for the last fifteen years or so, and she hasn't even adopted to DVDs yet). Certainly not crucial for the crisis (although the counters still don't hand out money yet), but do you think that this is the only example where the Greek financial, economical and social systems are lagging behind by probably decades?  The Troika wanted to change that, which was a respectable goal. But the plan was bad, and the Eurozone wasn't flexible enough to adjust to the situation because they got caught up in national interests. If we had an actual fiscal union, all of that could have been handled way more efficiently."

They have roughly every service in Hungarian including political representation which has governed Romania along with coalitions for decades. They are in the opposition atm.

You cannot with a straight face deny their oppression when you know they didn't have the same rights as others."
europe,3dy8y5,alecs_stan,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:55:06 2015 UTC,Lol it is clear you are not a Transylvanian. Romanians were not badly oppressed. They had many schools opened for them to learn in. My great grandfather was half romanian and half hungarian and he was able to learn in romanian in Austria-Hungary. He was never forced to become hungarian.  And yes hungarians are so well off. They are barely able to put up bilingual street signs in cities like marosvasarhely which are ~50/50 in ethnic composition (thanks to romanian colonization). Even in kolozsvar the mayor refuses to put up hungarian place names even though the city is historically hungarian with a large hungarian minority (yet again thanks to romanian colonization). The only reason romania gives the minimum rights to ethnic minorities is because if they don't then the euromonies will stop arriving.
europe,3dy8y5,alala_alala,3,Tue Jul 21 09:08:03 2015 UTC,"Indeed your great grandfather was lucky because those schools were funded by the romanian state, Vienna pulled funding for minority schools and later banned them altogether. Freedom of practice for sanctioned religions was also persecuted as well as voting rights and interaction with public authorities.  If you were to make corollary much of what happend to ethnic minorities under communist rule, ironic and sad. Some of those wrongs have been corrected, while others are ignored or gruggengly reinforced. We should learn from history."

Also you seem to whine a lot about how bad it was back then but you never experienced it. The life of Romanians wasn't that bad and their quality of life was higher than in wallachia and moldova.

However I do have relatives which are alive that faced persecution during communism in romania. And I used to have romanian relatives alive that lived when transylvania was part of hungary and they never talked of ""oppression"". It's all part of the communist propaganda machine. And transylvania was the richest part of romania went it was given to romania so of course the Romanians had a better quality of life. Why do you think all of those poor and illiterate vlachs were put into transylvania to ethnically cleanse hungarian and german areas?  And no comparing those things is not ignorant it just shows that the nations that received hungarian land after world war 1 are complete hypocrites. Also the Austrio hungarian empire was industrialized so I don't know what you're talking about. You are just a typical romanian nationalist who hates on hungarians."

Rich of you, pretending that you are the victims here.   Maybe about Polish Armia Krajowa killings of Lithuanians?

On Wilno one, the Polish was a stronger one. While there likely were some historicist-nationalist influences, the only reason we actually wanted Danzig was to have an international seaport, and when we failed to obtain the city we decided to build our own, better port in Gdynia. On the other had, I fail to see why you would want a landlocked city full of non-Lithuanians for any reasons other than pure nationalism (and imperialism, however funnily such word sounds in the context of Republic of Lithuania).

europe,3dy8y5,MrMykse,0,Tue Jul 21 10:23:40 2015 UTC,"So the russian occupation of Crimea is okay too cause the Russians are majority?   It's like you haven't even read my post. Since the German army left, the city of Wilno was exclusively controlled by Poles, and depending on the changing front, by Bolsheviks. At the time, Republic of Lithuania had nothing to do with the city (other than claiming it for themselves, of course). Lithuania took the city over in summer 1920, and in essence it was no different than taking the city over by Poles in October 1920... or Soviets in June 1920... or Poles in summer 1919... or Bolsheviks in April 1919... or Poles in January 1919. The Lithuanians merely happened to be the second to last to control the city for a while in this period while it often changed hands.  And the fact that you claimed it to be your capital, does not make those two months of Lithuanian control of Wilno between July 1920 and October 1920 any more legitimate than, say, Polish control of it in the August 1919-July 1920 period, or even the Bolshevik control of the city between April 1919 and August 1919. You just happened to be the penultimate ""occupier"", the one with a weak claim at best. Which brings us to the next matter:   Ohh and do you know who built and started the city yep Lithuanians do you know what countries capital it was in the Medival Ages?   This is a non-argument. Do you know who built and started the city of Pozsony/Pressburg, currently known as Bratislava, capital of Slovakia? Hint: it weren't Slovaks. Were Americans the ones to ""build and start"" the city of San Francisco? Maybe Turks built and started the city of Constantinop... Istanbul? Were the French the ones to build and start the city of Marseille, or were those Greek colonists? And wasn't London founded as a city in the Roman times? Surely the Republic of Italy (which has approximately the same ammount of connection to the Roman Empire as Republic of Lithuania has to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) would be in a right to claim the city of London... or rather Londinium - after all they were the ones who built and started the city, weren't they?   Ohh and please explain why polish goverment supports polish party in Lithuania who is so pro-kremlin.   That's actually the easiest thing to understand about this whole affair, and as much as I personally despise Russia.  In the late period of the Soviet Union, Poles were given their own autonomous region which happened to be composed from areas taken by Lithuania in 1939, which remained majority Polish to this day. After Lithuania bec   ame independent from Soviet Union in 1991, scrapping this region was one of the first decisions the new Lithuanian government did (despite earlier promises of Lithuanian officials that they will honour this autonomy). The only ones to protest were Russians, as government of the Republic of Poland decided not to protest, wanting to maintain good relations with newly independent state.  It's purely the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" mentality on both Russian and Polish-minority party side of this situation. And that's precisely the case because the Polish government values good relations with Lithuania more than our minority in your country."

I heard that Croatia was invited as well during its inception, but they Croatia refused. Now, I heard it a few times and read in an article, but I can't find it now, and I don't really have any other sources as of now so it's a bit of hearsay.  There were nods from other members since then, but it seems Croatia unfortunately isn't really interested. I blame the foreign relations ministry primarily, it's probably just incompetence.  For example, Hungarian minister of foreign affairs suggested that Croatia and Slovenia should be taken into consideration as V members.  Not much has happened, but the president is constantly going on about Baltic-Adriatic energy corridor with the planned LNG terminal, which gains more and more significance considering the current state of affairs with Russia. Some hope it could lead to a tighter cooperation between V4 and Croatia. There were also some discussions about V4 and Croatian identities, most notably Central European and Mediterranean. It has been more in the spotlight in the last year or so, but there's not much to talk about.  P.S. It's kinda late (so writting longer posts in English is bit of a pain) but I hope I was clear enough. If something is unclear, shoot."

Unfortunately, it looks there is no vision of the Croatian future, it's all consumed by short-sightedness. Current goverments back-pedaling from the decisions of the past, the future from the current and so on. Little to no political will to do something, it's all mostly left to inertion. The only thing they agreed upon is EU and NATO.  Just recently there was a map of high-speed railways, and I couldn't help but think that there could have been one connecting Rijeka and Budapest, because Rijeka used to be an extremely important port to Hungary, because of transport. But there is none. Instead, Rijeka is in decline, overshadowed by other competitors (such as Koper in Slovenia) who took over the initiative.  Like I said, while you can find works like this (in Polish) about Croatia and V4, there's almost nothing about it in Croatia.

Ensuring the press keep quite.   Hah, that's debatable and it's debated in Croatia, /r/conspiracy style.  Not about this thing particulary, but the general interest of medias. The media is very centered around ex-Yugo (not so much around Slovenia) - but languages are similar so it's understandable to some point. There's almost nothing about Hungary, eventhough we share a long border with them and had 800 years of interwined history.  People in general don't care much, so they consume what they are given through medias. As a result, most people won't care too much about anything, some will about ex-Yu, but almost none will know about V4 for example.  I wouldn't attribute this disinterest to entities per se, it's probably just due to lazyness and narrow-mindness of academics and other elites. It was just not discussed, nor was it taken note of. A lot of people are mentally stuck in some other times, we're still having ""Ustashas vs Partisans"" nonsense in 2015. Some people still have prejudices towards other eastern Europeans (we were more developed than them back then, now it's a bit different if we compare with CE (former EE :P) countries.    You think HDZ is mainly the culprit for keeping Croatia out or is SDP the same nonsense?   I wouldn't point fingers, I think every government for the past 20 years shares some of the blame. But in this particular government, the MVEP is so occupied with ex-yugo (not counting Slovenia), that it seems like nothing else exists. Vesna Pusić, the minister in charge of foreign relations, mentions ""regija"" non-stop, it's tiresome really. Add to this that she's fairly incompetent (she had huge gaffes as well) and you can't really expect much to happen in any way. Croatia in the EU is basically non-existant.  Though elections are coming soon, so I wonder if anyone will mention V4, but I doubt it.  P.S. Damnit, it's a wall of text again. :( It's less cohesive, but whatever. I just wanted to add a barometer of general public (n=1000).  If you check what neighbour regions should Croatia cooperate the most, almost 55% opted out for Central Europe, which is kinda surprising given its lack of exposure in media. But the 20% who don't know are also a force to be aware of."

europe,3dxhxn,LupineChemist,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair I don't think many airlines could run Londons airspace so splitting them up to speciality area's makes sense. Keep in mind the paths are set before they are taken and the radars and sensors keep track of them all as they cross into other countries airspace, then ground control keeps an eye on them.  How do you think it works right now? Either all the flight plans will stay the same or some will change but keeping and eye on them stays exactly the same."
europe,3dxhxn,paulusmagintie,3,Mon Jul 20 15:39:28 2015 UTC,Airlines have not and will not operate airspace.  This is so that all will be under a single organization. And London airspace at high altitude is completely different than at low altitude which is where all the congestion is. The object is basically to make it so it's not the CAA and whomever the agencies are for France/Belgium/Netherlands/Germany/Denmark are not all have to fight over the same relatively small geographic area. Right now they have to hand off control every time they cross airspace borders and it's kind of crazy.
europe,3dxhxn,LupineChemist,12,Mon Jul 20 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"So now we don't even ask anymore, but order?   Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands were given two months to finish implementing a “functional airspace block” created in 2013 to shorten flight paths by reorganizing airspace around traffic flows, not state borders.   That takes time. Only two months? and it's being worked on. Also the biggest reason for detours and fragmentation is reserved  military airspace. here is a good explanation of the problem The biggest reason for the delays are incompatible systems and having to reorganize everything (retrain staff, relocate staff/buildings/systems, start cooperation, etc.). This while not hampering the current systems so flights still can be handled 24/7 365/366 days a year.   Also most of these redesigns aren't even supposed to be done. Cba land in 2015 and Central west in 2016 (regions just under the FABEC)  These things take time, let's do it in a timely, safe and efficient manner let's not be hasty (mistakes will be made)."

America's the: 'torture wasn't actually torture' or all the other 'war crimes'.

But Amnesty International has documented wide-spread abuse and ill-treatment of Syrian and Afghan refugees passing through the Balkans.

The television here often doesn't report negative nationwide events in the news (everything crime-related is offloaded to a different program called ""Zona X"" on Belarus-1), thus the choice of reports on official TV here is really strange at times and often reeks of provincialism - where else stories like ""A baby with record weight was born in [insert town name here]"" would get into the nationwide evening news? Continuing with point 2, agricultural events are top stories more often than not, especially in late summer, when the harvest season begins. President Lukashenko used to be an administrator of a Soviet collective farm - he has personal interest in the subject. Official meetings, gatherings, inspections involving president Lukashenko obviously take top priority. Back in the day, the news segments on the TV here were something like ""President - Local news - Intl news - Sport - Weather"", now it's more like ""President - Intl news - Local news - Sport - Weather"".

The world view presented by the Belarusian media is not ""We're a fortress besieged by enemies - all must unite behind the president!"" but more like ""The world is falling apart, and Belarus is a save haven"". Belarusian official media go out of their way to be neutral in the coverage of the war in Ukraine. The official name for the combatants are ""Forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk/Lugansk People's Republic"" and ""Ukrainian authorities"" (Украинские силовики) - no terrorists, no Russians, no fascists and no nationalists. Official statements are generally reported from all sides (both Ukraine/EU and DNR/LNR/Russia). However, news reports here don't repeat accusations thrown around by the opposing parties - you won't hear anything about US covert actions, neo-Nazis, Russian invasions and that evil Putin. Any official Belarusian peacekeeping effort is obviously emphasized."

That's because he's polite. He doesn't try to appeal to the readers' emotions.

And the war’s conditions were undoubtedly difficult and challenging. After the great suffering the Turkish Cypriot people experienced in the 1950s and 1960s, the Greek Cypriot community too was one of the biggest victims of the 1974 tragedy caused by the Greek junta”.  In earlier statements on Monday, Anastasiades said he was particularly pleased with the remarks, adding that Akinci`s statement showed “gallantry”.  On Monday in a written statement to mark 41 years since the invasion, Anastasiades said he was “comforted” by the reference and acknowledgement by Akinci."

If they reach an agreement and both sides approve it, what is Turkey going to do? Currently it can affect Northern Cyprus politics because of the financial aid that goes there, but it won't matter after unification. Probably EU will fund the unification process anyway.  And you are mistaken about the roles. At least for the last decade or so, Turkish government has generally been much more willing about a solution than the Turkish Cypriot one.

Will they arrest Akıncı, stage a coup against a president who was democratically elected under the system they helped create and tried to legitimize for decades? That would be suicide for Turkey. And also, what if Northern Cypriot military decides to resist? Will Turkey go to war against Turkish Cypriots? I can't see how the Turkish military can get involved with anything at this point. Not to mention, if Turkey was so insanely stupid to do anything of the sort, the only result would be help cement the unification, not only politically, but also in the minds (nothing brings people closer than a common enemy)."

The Greek Government (in reality, a military junta) attempts to assassinate the President of Cyprus and annex the country.  Turkey exercises its right under the Treaty of Guarantee to ensure the neutrality of Cyprus. For some reason they ""forget"" to leave after the situation has ended.

europe,3dx67d,besteurope,-13,Mon Jul 20 11:11:41 2015 UTC,"Oh poor Greek Cypriots, they haven't done anything to deserve what has happened...   Intercommunal violence erupted on December 21, 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots, destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000-30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy; the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly refused to withdraw due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Turkish Cypriots started living in enclaves; the republic's structure was changed unilaterally by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the Green Line, with the deployment of UNFICYP troops.  by 1964, enosis was a Greek policy that could not be abandoned; Makarios and the Greek prime minister Georgios Papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and King Constantine wished Cyprus ""a speedy union with the mother country"". Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion.  On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta under Dimitrios Ioannides carried out a coup d'état in Cyprus, to unite the island with Greece. The coup ousted president Makarios III and replaced him with pro-enosis nationalist Nikos Sampson. In response to the coup, five days later, on 20 July 1974, the Turkish army invaded the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. This justification has been rejected by the United Nations and the international community.   What you might want to ask is why on earth would the Turkish Cypriots ever want to trust the Greek side?"

europe,3dx67d,KodiakAnorak,5,Mon Jul 20 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"Cyprus was originally settled by the Ancient Greeks.   Then it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.   In 1878 the Ottoman Empire leased Cyprus to The British Empire, the lease lasted until 1914 at which point the British and the Ottomans were at war and Britain annexed Cyprus and ruled outright.   After the Second World War the British Empire began to dissolve and there were various independence movements on Cyprus. Eventually in 1960 they became independent.   Turkey (as the successor state to the Ottomans) thought that Cyprus still belonged to it and in 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus and took around half the island.   The situation is complicated because around 80% of the Island identifies as Greek Cypriot while the rest identify as Turkish Cypriot, so while support for the Turks is not the majority there is a significant block of the population who do.   The spark for the Turkish invasion was a Greek Cypriot coup which wanted to dissolve Cyprus as a sovereign nation and incorporate it into Greece. (so the Greek Cypriots are not blameless either).   The Republic of Cyprus is part of the EU but Turkey is supported by the USA. So no one does anything and Cyprus remains balanced between powerful outside interests.   The Turkish controlled part of Cyprus exists in legal limbo. Turkey is the only nation which legally recognises it."

I'm pretty sure South Asian immigrants like Pakistanis (wich has pretty high birthrates like Kurds btw) in England can form a tiny country in a couple of years, no?   How are you not able to spot the difference between the two examples? it obviously makes no sense for an immigrant Pakistani to be able to come to the UK and then lobby for independence in the area he/she lives in, the Kurds however have been living in that region for at least as long as the Turks have been in Anatolia.  Not to mention that Kurds are overwhelming living in the south eastern corner of Turkey and make up between 15-25% of Turkey's population, whereas immigrants into the UK are spread throughout the whole country and all immigrant groups combined make up only around 12% of the UK's population.   Unlike some other countries in the region Turkey's borders isn't drawn by imperialistic Western powers. We fought and shed our blood for every inch of it. And it's one of the Atatürk's legacies to us. He gave lots of speeches about indivisibility of our lands. So NO.   Not exactly true now is it? both your south and eastern borders were drawn due to Ottoman territorial losses in WW1  as well as Turkey's western border being drawn by defeats against the south Slavic and Greek nations.   I'm all for minorities rights and voted for HDP in the last elections with a naive hope like they will cut their connections to PKK. But unfortunately they didn't.   Ok, so answer me this, if the Kurds overwhelmingly voted for a pro Kurdish independence party and then that party began to campaign for a Kurdish independence referendum would you support it?"

CH drew many Muhammads, and at a certain point atrocities happened. Now the debate is open and drawing the guy has become mainstream, and even worse, it is turned into a political weapon to promote an intolerance CH rejects.

europe,3dyh3o,Afro_Samurai,8,Mon Jul 20 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"This article is bullshit, honestly. The author's political agenda is all over the place and he doesn't seem to have any grudges in distorting reality to fit his narrative.    (...) Let’s be perfectly clear: this is an entirely understandable surrender to violence, though disappointingly one that is cloaked in euphemism. While Islam was far down on the list of Charlie Hebdo’s satire targets, Sourisseau told Stern that he wants to prevent people from thinking his magazine “was possessed by Islam.” And it was time to move on, he said, because “we’ve done our job [and] we have defended the right to caricature.”   Now the blunt attacks on Islamism — never on Muslims — regularly offered by the magazine’s murdered editor Stéphane Charbonnier have been replaced with the platitudes of its critics. “The mistakes you could blame Islam for can be found in other religions,” Sourisseau told Stern. I suspect he knows that this isn’t exactly true, especially in the era of the Islamic State. After all, the Charlie Hebdo offices weren’t bombed and sprayed with bullets by dyspeptic papists, and neither Riss or Luz have suggested that they’ll no longer draw Jesus. But this is the line we must all take now — even left-wing, French secular humanists — to insulate ourselves from charges of bigotry. (...)   The author thinks to know better than the cartoonists themselves what their real motives are. In the author's world, cartoonists of a very upfront satirical magazine suddenly hide behind ""euphemisms"". If they had the courage to publish Muhammad cartoons just after their colleagues were murdered for this, why would they suddenly stop ""out of fear"" one year after the events like the author unconvincingly states? If they say they don't do it out of fear, why would we not believe them? And why would their words not be their actual legit opinion, rather than a politically correct cover to hide their true motives, like the author depicts it?  The whole article is a false dilemma. Those who are aware the political scene in France will know that some members of the far-right were among the first standing up to use the Charlie Hebdo's tragic demise to market their message of intolerance, be it in France (FN comes to mind) but also elsewhere in Europe (the Dutch Geert Wilders being a prime example). They will also know that the surviving cartoonists refused to be used as a tool for this spread of hate and did everything they could to counter those opportunists. That's also why the message was one of tolerance: ""Tout est pardonné"". What the authors tries to demonstrate as a surrender to terrorist violence is really their courageous refusal to give in to the induced polarization whose only benefactors are Islamic and European extremists."

What the authors tries to demonstrate as a surrender to terrorist violence is really their courageous refusal to give in to the induced polarization whose only benefactors are Islamic and European extremists.   They are 'opportunists' because the shootings confirm their worldview and weaken their opponents'. So they naturally say 'we told you so', as any group would. The more terrorist attacks there are, the more it validates what the PC side calls ""islamophobia"", fear and distrust of islam. If there were no terrorist attacks, no ISIS, no boko haram, etc, it would be far easier to present the ""islamophobe"" as ""someone afflicted with an irrational fear"".   But the PC side somehow take the fact that terrorism helps right-wing arguments as a reason to dismiss them. Basically, they take evidence the wrong way: Where a rational person may look at the evidence and then decide his position, they assume their position is correct and then evaluate the evidence. That's how you get those bizarre ""right-wingers and terrorists are on the same side"" theories."

The debates around how the older, traditional and religious way of life and the newer, detraditionalized and individualist way of life must position each other in subjects were the 2 views are in conflict is an ongoing debate you can spot in every European country's recent history. It is a difficult, yet constructive dialogue. It is unreasonable to conflate this with either parts extremists, and ""your extremists are worse than ours"" has never been a valid argument. What those opportunists try to do is unfairly using highly emotional moments such as this tragedy to circumvent reason and merge the other side of the debate with its extremists in a Us vs Them narrative, even though the grand majority of them are in no way responsible of the extremists' doing. And conveniently calling those who oppose their opportunism of ""PC"" is part of it. That way, they try to use the terrorists doings that are ""unarguably bad"" to posit the position that the others are also ""unarguably bad"", that is what is meant with ""marginalizing"".   People that prefer conflict over dialogue benefit from polarization, so yes in that way the far-right and islamic radicals are frenemies, on the other side but both benefit from impeding moderate dialogue and generate conflict. This happens in every big political issue as of late, the Israel-Palestina issue for instance. CH is pro-dialogue, not pro-conflict."

It is a difficult, yet constructive dialogue.

If I was fighting against an anti-French sentiment in my country and on the news we hear about a French guy that shot everyone in a news outlet I'd be wrong to think my position is weakened. Because people share similarities doesn't mean they share responsibility, that is fallacious thinking. Even if the guy was your brother with as motive that the news outlet insulted your father on television and you agree it's outrageous that they did, doesn't make you share responsibility in your brother's actions.  And yes I disagree with paragraphs in Islamic writing, that doesn't justify anything. A religion is not something people undergo, but something they actively live. Like the rules of a language, it is partly imposed, but also evolves over time. It has many (regional) dialects, versions, so that, even if maybe similar in many ways, Muslims won't practice the same way as another. I'm a pro-Enlightenment thinker, I believe in the perfectibility of man. One is entitled to its own actions, not his religion, not his community, but he himself is responsible for his behavior. How he comes to a behavior that doesn't break democratic laws is not my business, whether he rejects a religion, grows into a variant that respects the rules or any other way.

The confused older couple pointed at the sign that stated 2 EUR, at which the juice-seller showed them something that Looks like a shot glass and said ""this is 2 EUR"".  Damn tourist traps all around."

There's speculation that DF put that in their list of coalition demands because they didn't want to join the government, so deliberately put in things they knew Venstre couldn't agree to.  I could see something softer, like more spot customs checks, being possible.

Everyone here eats up British culture from the comedians to the TV shows to the music to the food/beer/sports/etc.  While people may be ignorant of the nuances of British culture/history there is no doubt that the UK exports a huge amount of itself to foreign markets, for better or worse.   NOTE: Ranking ""soft power"" is incredibly hard to do but it wouldn't surprise me if the UK came out on top due to how expansive it's cultural exports are. I'm just saying those rankings almost came across as biased."

This is measured by gross national income (GNI) and accounts for the largest proportion of each country's contribution. • A percentage of VAT income. • Additional revenues raised from customs duties, agricultural levies, VAT and even sugar contributions are collected on behalf of the EU (countries are entitled to a rebate of 25pc of these revenues to help pay for administration costs - last year the UK received €850m back from Brussels for this reason).

europe,3dxg9o,luomo_tigre,6,Mon Jul 20 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"it's actually a grim heritage of Eastern/Central Europe as a whole. Serfdom ruled supreme in our parts of the continent well till mid 19th century. Even longer in Russia (and thus part of Poland under russian rule).   It had a massive influence on our history, language - hell, even cousine - but, funnily enough, not nearly as great on our culture. our culture, as we know it today, was created and cultivated by serfdom beneficiaries - the nobles. so no wonder.  for example when every Pole learns in school by heart lines from early 19th century national epic ""Pan Tadeusz"", she or he hardly realizes that idyllic descriptions of Polish countryside (well Lithuanian actually... ) at that time were idyllic for no more than 8-10% of polish society (and mind you the number of nobility in Commonwealth was HUGE, compared to 1% in France and 3% in Great Britain). rest of our ancestors were in a position comparable to black slaves in US.  this is not much of an exaggeration. true, serfs were not officially owned by the landowner (so there were not a tradable commodity) and depending on the period and region, had some minimal personal rights, but still:   they were bonded to the land owned by the nobel - so no freedom of movement were obliged to work the owner's land for up to 6 days a week were outside of the juridical system, meaning if a nobel fancied to punish or even kill a serf - well, bummer for the serf. in Commonwealth serfs were put under common law by the Constitution of 3rd May. and as much as we Poles like to praise our ""second constitution in the world, first in Europe"", it most definitely did not abolish serfdom. ironically, the little rights given to serfs and (reasonably more) to city freemen, were a major reason for a big part of nobility to team up with Russia and in aftermath disband Poland as a country for 200 years.    one could argue that serfdom was effectively abolished in Poland as late as 1944, by - yes, you guessed it - those pesky commies and their Land reform. why? because even though serfdom was abolished in mid 19th century, giving civil rights to peasants did not change their position. land they were living off, was still owned by nobles. feudal servitude was nearly replaced with an economical dependence.  and even today, when you read our history textbooks, you get a somehow twisted view. For example the only peasant uprising that polish school children can learn about (and shit there were literally hundreds of them - avid Europa Universalis IV players can attest) is the so called Galician slaughter of 1846. And as the name suggest, depiction of it is dominated by vivid descriptions of atrocities committed on polish gentry, quickly followed by a constatation how Austro-Hungarian partitioner used it to stifle national tendencies among polish nobility."
europe,3dxg9o,capdeporc2005,2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"and even today, when you read our history textbooks, you get a somehow twisted view.   It's exactly the same in Romania, where pre-Communist history has been essentially canonized as a Golden Age, and events like the 1907 Peasants' revolt when authorities slaughtered over 10,000 peasants have been de facto air brushed out of history books. If you even dare to bring it up, most of the time you're labeled as a Communist apologetic."
europe,3dxg9o,vortalwombat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:44:14 2015 UTC,"Although serfdom was abolished in Hungary in 1848, the status of the agricultural workers was terrible until 1945. The farm servants (who had no land and was employed by yearly contracts) had almost no rights. If they started anything to defend themselves, like a strike for their wages, gendarmes immediately appeared and crushed them. In many cases with volley fire.  There is a good Hungarian non-fiction book about the farm servants, written by Gyula Illyes in the 1930's the People of the puszta, here is an excerpt in English. Hungarians today usually forget that almost a million people lived under such circumstances, which were only abolished by the communists.  As our culture based on the 19th century noble, gentry culture too, most of the Hungarians behave like a descendants of the landowner gentry and forget the sufferings of the poorer two-thirds of the country before 1945.*"

I mean, you take absolutely everybody's argument into consideration, otherwise you'd be a hypocrite.   Yes, I believe in the radical notion that the strength of an argument is what warrants my attention, not the kind of person making it.

My mormon example was actually charitable to you because the mormon was still arguing about theism. Should I refuse to engage him on subjects that have nothing to do with theism?   You don't have to. I mean, I get your point, but picking fights with strangers over their opinion of a slovenian marxist seems... overzealous.

Your own article is contradicting you. Gambia, Senegal and almost all the other countries in west Africa don't qualify you for refugee status. If these people were refugees they wouldn't be 70-80% young men.  smug, cunty tl;dr: most of these refugees are economic migrants taking advantage of Europe's generosity to actual refugees, the opinion of a random bleeding heart leftie eager to flood his country with dependents who will riot if they don't like their accommodations notwithstanding"

Refugee acceptance rates in Slovakia is few % at most, in Hungary it is around 8%.

For what it's worth and despite their socio-economic situations, these countries have accomplished a monumental task. Meanwhile, mighty Europe with it's wealth, power, or tradition for rule of law and human rights, is hell bent on finding loopholes wherever possible in an attempt to offload the issues elsewhere, just to make sure others don't get a bite of our sweet pie.  Demanding from people escaping poverty, violence and persecution to settle for the first minor improvement over their initial circumstances is like asking an inexperienced carpenter to perform a brain surgery.

europe,3dtq2v,Low_discrepancy,33,Sun Jul 19 12:57:20 2015 UTC,"Academic economics isn't anything like the economic talking points that politicians and the media use.  For one, the larger theoretical context of ideas that are at any point being touched upon in a discussion are at least not disassociated from each other. So the discussion is at worst about relevancy and at best already mostly solved by data and a greater existing literature that the audience would be familiar with. There isn't the lack of context of which the theories are to each other, and all the theories would be understood (even if not always agreed upon) which is why the discussion would at worst be about relevancy of a theory in specific examples.  As it turns out, developmental macroeconomics theory has a huge amount of already existing literature, data, and analysis for which the relevancy to the greek situation isn't all that controversial at all. Which is what /u/flocosix meant by ""/r/economics[1] would have little to no questions, his economic stance is clear, well-founded and universally supported among those who are not politically invested."" There have already been a great amount of previous theory and literature that has existed on existing on similar theoretical situations that has been universally grounding theory even before the crises, and what has happened since and all we know of it and all that's been written about it since have only really further supported that. And most importantly, everything that Varoufakis has published or said exists firmly in that context. There isn't controversy about what he's saying on a theoretical level, if you want to disprove Varoufakis then you'd basically need to try to tackle all the accepted theories that he stands behind (which is important to do for a science regardless, but it's not something that hasn't already well faced the scrutiny of more superficial questions like what you'd find on a reddit AMA).  Now if you want to understand why that is totally and utterly different from discussions that laypeople, the media, and politicians espouse, the theoretical context is all but totally absent and every idea that's talked about seems to exist in it's own original vacuum as if there isn't any relation whatsoever between other theories.  Basically, it isn't ""economics"" because economic theory in it's entire worth as economic isn't what's being weighed, but more so just ""economic"" talking points and anecdotes that are used without context to support people's worldviews. These people are not familiar with all that existing literature, they just take the points that already suit them and dissociate it (on purpose and because of ignorance) from the context of which all that literature and theory has since progressed and used."

Well there's a lot of defaults that have happened all over the world, and ideas on monetary unions are not new. The fact that it's happening in Europe and it's under a shared currency doesn't change what all theory says about it, but it will make it a case study in hindsight. Which is not where we're at yet and doesn't change the fact that most people who are acquainted with all the relevant theory definitely believe in certain prescriptions.   And that's the problem. Theoretical solutions have to be applied to the real world. And that takes political will. You cannot dissociate one from the other in such a case. Maybe that's a reason he's no longer a minister (a political position again).   Have you seen any interview or read anything from him? Varoufakis would go up and make purely economic cases and arguments and he would be met with total apathy and disinterest in anything economic. Quite frustrating to an academic who is used to at least some sort of reaction from talking. You could make the case that he's a bad politician, but should that really matter when the other side is already totally unwilling to consider a rational approach? Is that on him, or should he be more of a reactionary and spread further disrespect and disinterest for a field he himself has spent a lifetime treating with utmost seriousness and dignity. It isn't that he's a bad player but that the game itself is just so shitty and reprehensible.  The fact that things aren't happening because of politics still says absolutely nothing about economics or of his arguments, all it potentially says is about the political situation or (dis)functionality of it.  But anyways, you're the one who said,   What is this non-political economics you speak of?   Well that's what Varoufakis tried to do and he was met with blank stares. It's not that non-political economics doesn't exist, far from it, it's that politicians would prefer to think and say that it doesn't exist rather than forsake making something a political issue instead of just a technical one."

Whether that allows Keynes to return to prominence or some kind of third theory to move in is anyone's guess.  *these things never go away with just one earth shattering crisis.

Then exactly this question will be discussed — not now, but then.”   This is a catch-22:   Merkel has said there is no deal without IMF The IMF has said it won't participate unless the deal includes debt restructuring Now Merkel says she won't consider debt restructuring until after the deal is finalized and Greece passes the first review   But, in a letter to the German parliament, Finance Minister Schaeuble said that the first tranche of the new bailout deal, scheduled for mid-August 2015, won't involve the IMF:   The letter said the IMF would make its further involvement dependent on a successful conclusion of the first program review in autumn 2015 and a confirmation of Greece's debt sustainability."

The Interview is called the Sommerinterview (summer interview). It's a series of interviews with high ranking politicians during the summer break of the parliament, first established in the 80ies.

In order for Greece to qualify, their DSA must be reevaluated and must be interpreted to be sustainable.   I don't think it will be enough just to say 'debt relief (restructuring) will occur after a review of the programme'--because a promise to consider it won't inherently change the DSA. In order to do that, in fact, it will need to contain specific provisions which explicitly state what relief would happen and when.   The discussion of and formulation of those elements is precisely what the Germans are ruling out. Catch-22 indeed."
europe,3dwtbb,tessl,2,Mon Jul 20 09:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yep. If we take Merkel at her word (here), and the IMF at theirs, they're at an impasse.  Perhaps Schäuble  envisages a two-part bailout deal, where the first is only EFSM funds and no restructuring; if successful, they then negotiate the second part with restructuring and IMF involvement.  To that, here's another catch-22 from the report which described the Schäuble letter (from July 16):   Peter Altmaier, chief of staff of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said on a German television talk show late on Thursday that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde had ""made very clear that the IMF will not withdraw"" from bailing out Greece.  Speaking on the show on ZDF, Altmaier said Berlin had ""quite clearly said that the IMF must remain on board, that the IMF must be involved"".  Earlier on Thursday, Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, told an emergency session of the Dutch parliament there was broad agreement that the IMF needed to be involved in future Greek bailouts."
europe,3dwtbb,oreoconvict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:23:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps Schäuble envisages a two-part bailout deal   Or he's banking on the very likely chance that Greece won't be able to meet its obligations for the first evaluation.

europe,3dwtbb,janethefish,3,Mon Jul 20 10:22:06 2015 UTC,"Even if your credits consist on 0% and 50 years, you still have to pay the principal, thus reducing the amount of liquidity you can allocate to investments.

Arbitrations have never in their entire history once forced a government to repeal a law or alter it in anyway. Fines have been imposed (due to loss of revenue in one case because the government was changing the regulations every 5 seconds for a power station), but a law has never been repealed because of ISDS.  I would highly suggest you listen to Jeff, he knows what he is talking about when it comes to FTA's and ISDS.

That alone is bullshit and gives companies way too much power.   The companies are not in control of the arbitration, highly skilled and respected lawyers are.   Also there are no judges in ISDS to begin with.   There are no ""official"" government appointed judges, in this case they are called arbitrators; because ISDS is ultimately a court of arbitration between state and corporation.   He knows what he's talking about when it comes to ISDS yeah.   Glad you agree.   But he is clearly not unbiased (even though he claims he is)   I have not claimed he is unbias.   and surely he is aware that ISDS can be used in a very ugly manner.   As I said before, he sees ISDS as a necessary evil. It means German/British/French companies are ruled against as if they were a non-foreign company when operating in America and vice versa. This is helpful since America is one of the most protectionist countries on the planet. But IMO a company should never be able to challenge a governments laws so I'm still against ISDS.   For example like tobacco companies sueing countries that apply stricter smoking laws.   Phillip Morris is suing Australia because the Australian government has removed their trade mark, which Phillip Morris paid for.  I agree, it is bad and one of the reasons I'm against ISDS. But SavannaJeff would make the case that Phillip Morris will lose and the Australian government will not have to do anything. Phillip Morris simply wanted to stop/hinder the spread of laws similar to this.   constraint of national sovereignity   Haven't you already admitted that this is bogus?   -so called ""Treaty shopping""   Doesn't this only apply to taxes?   -lack of transparency   TTIP will be publicly available for more than a year before it comes out. It will have to go through 28 national parliaments of the EU, the European Parliament and the US senate before it even goes into force.  There will be no shortage of re-readings.   -The fact that countries can be sued(hopefully the correct word) for applying laws. Because this will influence Lawmakers.

Don't get me wrong, be wary of TTIP and personally I am still against ISDS; but the amount of absolute toss (misinformation) on TTIP is astonishing.   What I don't respect is someone who actively tries to downplay the downsides of said treaty in order to convince people this isn't something to worry about at all.   I would say he combats misinformation rather than ""downplay the downsides"". TTIP is still the single most transparent trade agreement in history, but that speaks more about the previous trade agreements than it does about this one.  Just keep in mind that it has to be ratified and signed by literally every single country that it would effect before it comes into force. e.g. 28 national parliaments, the European Parliament and the US senate.  I would say this anti-TTIP campaign is heavily overblown, but that I am still against ISDS."
europe,3dxmle,LimitlessLTD,0,Mon Jul 20 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"Phillip Morris sued more than just australia. And not just concerning some logo.    I guess I worded that wrongly (my english isn't on point all the time). ISDS rulings aren't above the law as in they can change laws or can overrule them. What I meant is that governments can be 'attacked' by companies for laws they apply. That alone is a constraint of national sovereignity if you ask me. Because if governments have to think about what company might sue them because of a law, they are already influenced. They shouldn't need to have this in the back of their heads while ruling national laws. Hardly bogus if you ask me. And you say I shouldn't read about TTIP online. Well the official documents are available online and that's where I got most of my information. I prefer reading official documents over opinions online. I even read up on the links jeff spread here (aside from the official ones he cherrypicks sometimes) and well what can I say? Didn't convince me that TTIP is something the general population will benefit of."

You will find no qualms here, as I have said before; I'm against ISDS.   And you say I shouldn't read about TTIP online.   I didn't say that, I said use caution when doing so. Precisely because of the misinformation that the anti-TTIP campaign peddles. IMO the only valid concern is ISDS, and the EU seems set on reforming that.   Didn't convince me that TTIP is something the general population will benefit of.   Apart from ISDS, which I disagree with. Why's that?"

And that deal was nowhere near being approved, hence the referendum.  Instead, capital controls were imposed on June 29 -- one day early, and would have lasted for as long as a new deal was agreed...which is today.  So, for one more day of capital controls, Tsipras appears to have negotiated a 3-year, 80bn deal instead of an 8bn handout after which he would have been back negotiating again in 6 months. Even if the cost was around 3bn, assuming the deal goes through and reforms are actually implemented, it was probably worth it."

Currently there are between 70-80 Bosnian citizens in Syria and Iraq and the last time we had a religiously motived attack (which Zvornik wasn't) was in 2011 (scrached windows of the US embassy) when a total of one person was injured - the attacker."

I also agree for all the talk about an ""ISIS threat"" in the Balkans, Islamist terrorism here is actually less of a threat than in Western Europe.

Somehow, that would make the rest of the Eurozone so scared that they would agree to new loans on much more favourable terms.

My view was – and I put this to the government – that if they dared shut our banks down, which I considered to be an aggressive move of incredible potency, we should respond aggressively but without crossing the point of no return.  We should issue our own IOUs, or even at least announce that we’re going to issue our own euro-denominated liquidity; we should haircut the Greek 2012 bonds that the ECB held, or announce we were going to do it; and we should take control of the Bank of Greece. This was the triptych, the three things, which I thought we should respond with if the ECB shut down our banks.   He already talked about issuing IOUs. ""Take control of the Bank of Greece"" doesn't mean he wanted it to print Euros -- he wanted the 17 billion euros in the banks reserves which currently can't be released without ECB consent.  Don't forget that a Grexit would formally severe the Bank of Greece from the ESCB and therefore the ECB. The 89 billion ECB ELA, which had mostly been turned into cash Euros or transferred abroad, would show up as an almost total loss on the ECB's balance sheet if Greece left."

Later on, his family opposed the creation of such a category (for political reasons -- they saw it as being a way to give right-wing economic theories a podium), but Sweden's central bank chose to fund the creation of an award, with a similar name, wanting to share in the prestige that had become attached to the other Nobel prizes.  In practice, people refer to the award today as the ""Nobel Prize in Economics"" and most aren't familiar with its status.  I kind of wish that economics had did what other fields did and just established their own high-prestige award, the way mathematics did with the Fields Medal or computer science did with the Turing Award and avoided the whole controversy.  Still, I suppose it makes sense in terms of granting prestige in the eyes of the public, since the general public knows what a Nobel is, but far fewer people outside the academic field in question know what a Fields Medal or Turing Award is."

I actually don't mind his pure economic analysis even if I sometimes have issues with it, but it's how he conflates political opinion and economics that bothers me so much.  This OP is a good example, there were a lot of issues of basic competence from the beginning.

Most people never read an economics book in their lives, and wouldn't even be able to understand anything by Krugman. Therefore, like I said, usually the criticism (if you can even call it that) is by people who know jack shit. They have no idea what they are talking about.  Regarding his work, he was the first to develop models of currency-crisis, and we are talking back in 1979. He knew more about these matters already 35 years ago, than most people here, who don't even have freshman knowledge on the matter, will ever know in their entire lives. Yet they make fun of his Nobel Prize (as if his fame derived from that).   As for his work these days, this is from 2012, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics.   Talking about ""specialization"" is absurd. Of course that is so, but I can tell you during my PhD I'd meet with the greats of my dept for insight, obviously not all of my specific field, and while technical details could escape them, more often than not, they would display an amazing high-level  understanding, and provide clues I'd never thought of.  Dijsselbloem for instance, doesn't have a fucking MSc, and had to spend great part of his career just dealing with political bullshit that has nothing to do with economics, sucking a cock here and there, most Krugman's work would fly over his head. Never mind most people here.   But hey people talk about the other economists. Show them! Say, I agree with this guy here rather than Krugman because... blah blah blah. Because we never see that, just Krugman is an idiot. Hey Paul de Grauwe? Somehow he's an idiot too. Mark Blyth? Another idiot.

europe,3dvirj,oblio-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:48:13 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how economics in a currency union works, more specifically that's the whole point of it. In the Maastricht criteria we have agreed that all nations ought meet a 2% inflation target. What that simply means is that all nations have agreed to increase their nominal wages 2% faster than their productivity does.   If that is not the case it would mean that every country starts a deflationary race to the bottom (as there are no flexible exchange rates) to undercut their 'competitors'. That would be absolutely catastrophic for every domestic market (because it would destroy demand and increase unemployment, what is exactly what we see in Southern Europe) and thus destroy the purpose of the currency Union in the first place."
europe,3dvirj,Nyxisto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"In the Maastricht criteria we have agreed [...]   Then it's a pity that those criteria aren't respected even by Eurozone members:  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=teina225&plugin=1   The ratio of gross government debt (measured at its nominal value outstanding at the end of the year, and consolidated between and within the sectors of general government) relative to GDP at market prices, must not exceed 60% at the end of the preceding fiscal year. Or if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the 60% limit, the ratio shall at least be found to have ""sufficiently diminished and must be approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace"".   Germany: 74%, Ireland: 109%, Greece: 177%, Italy 132%,  Cyprus 107%, Slovenia: 80%, Portugal: 130%, Austria: 84%, Netherland: 68%, France: 95%, Spain: 97%. And for many of those it's going up, not down, so even the second part of that quote is not helping.  I'm sure that if I go through the other criteria I'll find plenty of ""misdemeanors"", to say the least.  But I was actually talking about the basis of economics, which is competition. Sure, countries should cooperate at a macro level to reach commonly agreed upon indicators, but for that to work companies and individuals across those countries should compete in a (mostly) free market."
europe,3dvirj,oblio-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium#Coordination_game     A famous example of this type of game was called the stag hunt; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former providing more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they suspect that the other will hunt the rabbit, they should hunt the rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.     Economics doesn't work like that because we made it to not work like that. It can change. But yeah, it requires trust."

europe,3dvirj,oblio-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:41:57 2015 UTC,"No. Competition in a currency Union, especially wage competition is hugely counterproductive as it would imply that the interests of the nations aren't aligned and would result in a deflationary race to the bottom.   The whole point of the currency union is to harmonize wage development, that is why the ECB has set a 2% inflation target. What that simply means is that nomial wages have to grow 2% faster than productivity (push-cost theory) in every respective EU country. If countries ignore that, imbalances occur that cause systemic trouble. Because exchange rates are fixed wage cuts would be the only way to stay competitive, destroying demand and thus the domestic economy. That is exactly what we have been seeing in Southern Europe."

The correction now was inevitable, 'austerity' is just a scapegoat here.  Also, if you look at the EU members or Europe on a global stage, Germany is barely scraping by, together with the Netherlands, Switzerland and a few others. Southern countries are exposed to global competition much more than just a decade ago or even earlier. It's the EU vs rest of the world, not Germany or Northern Europe against Southern Europe.  All the problems attributed now to the EU, lack of transfers or evil Germany are due to lack of competitiveness on a global scale. This will bite us hard if we don't recognize it."

And if you keep the absolute size of the German economy in mind it is immediately clear that the other countries could never (or should!) devaluate in a way that would match Germany's behaviour.

German Government Divided Over Greece BY JAN HILDEBRAND AND BARBARA GILLMANN Greece’s prime minister has already fired the more radical members of his government, after letting go his finance minister two weeks ago. Could Germany’s Angela Merkel be forced to do the same?  Angela Merkel was understandably cautious in her response: “Nobody came to me and asked for any kind of dismissal,” the German chancellor said in an interview with public broadcaster ARD on Sunday.   The question was about Wolfgang Schäuble, her finance minister and fellow Christian Democratic Party (CDU) member, who in an interview with Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine on Sunday said he was prepared to resign if ever forced to take a position on Greece that he didn’t agree with.  “We have a joint result, and the finance minister will now lead these negotiations just as I will,” Ms. Merkel said. She added, firmly: “We will now work together in this coalition and of course together in the [Christian Democratic] Union.”  These words were aimed as much at her fiercely independent finance minister as anyone else, and were designed to smooth over the massive gulf of opinion within her own party over Greece.  The issue of Greece, and whether or not the troubled country deserves its third bailout in five years to stave off bankruptcy, has opened up a chasm in Ms. Merkel’s governing coalition.  On the one side is Mr. Schäuble and the right wing of the CDU party. While Ms. Merkel says a “Grexit” has been off the table since euro zone leaders agreed to give Greece a third, final bailout last week, her finance minister believes it remains very much in the cards.  On the other side is Ms. Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, led by deputy chancellor and economics minister Sigmar Gabriel. Sources in Berlin say that the relationship between Mr. Schäuble and Mr. Gabriel has been irreparably damaged by the Greece crisis.  While Ms. Merkel says a 'Grexit' has been off the table since euro zone leaders agreed to give Greece a third, final bailout last week, her finance minister believes it remains very much in the cards.  For now, Ms. Merkel’s coalition is holding. The German parliament, the Bundestag, voted overwhelmingly on Friday in favor of the E.U. starting talks with Greece over a third bailout aimed at keeping Greece inside the 19-nation currency bloc. The vote removed a final stumbling block, allowing E.U. negotiators to this week get down to the business of ironing out the details of the bailout package.  But, like Mr. Schäuble, many parliamentarians remain hugely skeptical that the negotiations will really bear fruit. Significantly 65 members of the CDU did not back the government on Friday in the Greek vote.  There remain serious doubts in Germany over whether Greece will follow through with harsh structural reforms that Europeans have demanded, but which Athens believes are detrimental to its economy.  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last weekend agreed to the demands of Greece’s creditors in exchange for starting talks on a third bailout that could total €86 billion. It was a decision that cost him the support of much of his own left-wing Syriza party. Over the weekend he was forced to re-organize his own government by firing ministers that opposed the new bailout’s harsh terms.  Mr. Tsipras had already let go his outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, earlier this month, who resigned just one day after the Greek public voted overwhelmingly against the austerity path demanded by creditors in a referendum on July 5. Will Ms. Merkel be forced to fire her finance minister too?  Most political observers believe this is unlikely. But it is clear that Mr. Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister since 2009 and a one-time challenger of Ms. Merkel’s for leadership of the CDU party, has done his best in the past few weeks to make life difficult for his boss.  “It is part of democracy that one can have differences of opinion,” Mr. Schäuble said in the Spiegel interview published on Friday, adding that nobody can force him to take a decision he didn’t want to take. “If somebody were to try, I could go to the president and ask for my dismissal.”  The threat was clearly aimed at Ms. Merkel – a warning that he would not tolerate any and every decision on Greece – even if Mr. Schäuble later in the same interview, asked if he was really thinking about tendering his resignation, responded: “What gives you that idea?“  For many outside observers, Mr. Schäuble’s tough line on Greece has undermined the European ideal. They argue that the austerity conditions attached to two bailouts worth €240 billion have saddled Greece with unsustainable debt and no hope of recovery.  Mr. Schäuble insists that debt relief is not compatible with membership of the euro zone, and he has suggested that if Greece is to really cut its debt burden it needs to exit the common currency.  For Mr. Schäuble, this threat isn’t just about being tough on Greece. It’s about forcing Athens to stick to the rules that govern the 19-nation euro zone – rules that have been broken far too many times in the past. Anything else will undermine the future stability of the currency area.  “Europe is close to his heart,” insisted one confidant of the finance minister, who declined to be named. The message, in Mr. Schäuble’s mind, is that he’s even willing to risk his job for it.  Mr. Schäuble also knows that his threat poses a significant problem for Ms. Merkel. While the finance minister may be vilified abroad, he is more popular than ever with the public and with members of his own political party.  “At the moment he feels he is number 1 on the Greek question. However, he is only the favorite of the Germans on this one point,” said Gero Neugebauer, a politics professor at the Free University in Berlin.  Mr. Neugebauer cautioned that he doesn’t expect Mr. Schäuble to resign.  “If he resigned, then he would be acting against his own belief, that he is a servant, that he is in the government for the party, and that he is not there to satisfy his own vanity,” Mr. Neugebauer said.  But should Mr. Schäuble decide at any point to withdraw his backing of a third bailout package for Greece, Ms. Merkel would have a full-blown rebellion on her hands. Indeed his call to keep the idea of “Grexit” alive has resonated with the many members of his own party who, like him, chose to provisionally back negotiations over a third bailout in Friday’s parliamentary vote.  “I wish the negotiations success, but not at any price,” Günther Kirchbaum, a CDU parliamentarian and head of the Bundestag’s committee on European issues, told Handelsblatt.  Mr. Kirchbaum added that a Grexit remained an option for him, too, even if he voted in favor of starting the negotiations. He called the Friday Bundestag vote “the toughest I’ve had to make as a parliamentarian.”  While Ms. Merkel has done her best to gloss over the differences in her own party, her junior coalition partner in government, the Social Democrats, are hoping to benefit from the ruckus.  Sigmar Gabriel, head of the SPD and the country’s vice chancellor, called it a “gigantic conflict” between Mr. Schäuble and Ms. Merkel.  Mr. Gabriel’s own relationship with the finance minister is in tatters: “Mr. Schäuble turned the SPD against him,” Mr. Gabriel said in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF.  The chief argument between the two men stems from a paper authored by Mr. Schäuble and submitted during last weekend’s marathon talks in Brussels. It was a paper that suggested Greece should leave the euro on a temporary basis for five years, causing outrage in many European quarters.  The proposal also got Mr. Gabriel, who also serves as the country’s economics minister, in hot water after he initially suggested he was “of course” aware of Mr. Schäuble’s proposal. He has since distanced himself, telling the ZDF that it was “not sensible” for the proposal to be brought forward in the name of Germany.  The opposition Green Party, meanwhile, sees the so-called governing right-left coalition as severely weakened and urged Ms. Merkel to pay closer attention to Europe than to the musings of her finance minister.  “Finance ministers come and go, but the relations with our most important European partner France and our European stance remain,” Cem Özdemir, head of the Green Party, told Handelsblatt. “These will have to withstand both Schäuble’s Grexit and Gabriel’s hedging.”  Jan Hildebrand is Handelsblatt’s chief political correspondent in Berlin.

Both remove people from the unemployment stats but Tus is evil IMO as if the person can get a job, they might not be allowed take it as part of the scheme. It is a welfare trap."

No. It is because the Greek economy was in much worse shape from the beginning.   And there is no other option but austerity. Their GDP was blown up by loans, and they had constant huge budget deficits, and a unsustainable system. One has to change that and of course that affects the economy.   That said, Greece should of course not have entered the Eurozone in the first place and should leave. A Grexit is their only chance."

All three countries kept the agreement secret.   De aanval op Srebrenica door de Bosnisch-Servische troepen begon op 6 juli.

You can blame the US and UK all you want, but fact of the matter is if our government had really cared they could have nationalized the dutch UN contingent and launched jets in the area, and even if they were not in the area.

As a person of Ashkenazi background, I would say it depends on more than just the person's ethnic background.   Israelis in general are not Europeans, mostly because they are culturally distinct from us. Many have strong ties to Europe, but that doesn't make them ""European"", any more than the Americans are.   Not all Israeli Jews are European ethnic. There are several major Jewish groups including the Mizrahi and Sephardim.    The political culture and religious nature of Israeli society is far from typically European. The ""siege"" mentality is hard to understand. Can you imagine the unique role of the Haredim in a European society?

News of previous generations had a clearer wall of separation from the factual news section and the opinion sections. These days, many of the most popular news sources have a self-described bias.

With the GDP having shrunk by 25% in the past 5 years and unemployment soaring at 27% (60% youth unemployment) I don't think you can claim in good conscience that any significant majority or minority is enjoying a lavish lifestyle.  Besides, a healthcare crisis is a whole different issue. You may argue that Greeks shouldn't be able to enjoy such a luxurious lifestyle in the first place if the growth was due to over-borrowing and you may be right for all I know. However access to proper healthcare isn't a privilege nor a luxury; it's a fundamental human right.  Letting any country's healthcare system go to shit and the population die because ""Greece is getting more money to support a lifestyle they couldn't afford in the first place."" is ultimately not just moronic but inhumane.

I own a piece of land and in the contract it's something like this: The land starts from the road and extends till the creek. It follows the creek till the rocks. From the rocks it goes northwest till a tree.  For every piece of such land, an engineer or whatever must go there and actually measure the distances assuming there are no conflicts. If there are conflicts, disputes or whatever, witnesses are called and if it's not handled even then, it goes to the court.  That's why it's hard to make a real land registry in Greece."

The problem is that consumers here try to save money on food a lot, i.e. there is a big pressure on prices.

I have nothing against Germans, on the contrary, but I'm always surprised at how they're always among the most positively viewed. I mean Germany doesn't stand for any principles on the world stage, hardly participating in anything beyond European economic issues (at least comparatively to the size of its population/economy, it seems to have a very limited diplomatic reach).

Eritrean translators are deliberately mistranslating the testimonies of refugees during their hearings, according to dissidents' groups in Germany. Some are even intimidating them into hiding human rights abuses.  ""He asked us, 'Wait, where's the part where I was tortured in prison?' And we said, 'that's not in here.' He was completely horrified,"" Rut Bahta, co-founder of the Frankfurt-based Eritrean dissident network United4Eritrea, said she has a few stories along these lines.  Her group, which provides support for new arrivals from Eritrea, often has to retranslate into Tigrinya the transcripts of their asylum hearings, which the authorities only provide in German. It's at this point, Bahta said, many find out that the state-assigned translators had mistranslated or omitted major details.  ""He couldn't believe it at first - we had to get a third person to translate,"" Bahta told DW. ""He'd been through countries like Sudan and Libya, where no one ever asked him what happened to him. This was his first time in Europe, and he thought everything would be done properly now. He was utterly shocked - disappointed in the institution.""  Bahta thinks there is only one explanation for what she sees as deliberate misdirection.
