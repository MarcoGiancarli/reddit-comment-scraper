Treknobabble,3e3pzj,deadfraggle,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"If it does exist, where?    Could you clarify what you mean? Your title asks if there is ""room"", but your message asks if there is interest. Are you asking where the interest is among fans for an original timeline series, or where such a series could exist?  Sad to imagine, but I think the original timeline is never coming back in series form. Any hope of NuTrek being contained to a movie trilogy died when Paramount signed Pine and Quinto to a fourth film. Paramount will likely continue making Star Trek films as long as it is profitable, without any concern of giving way to a television series. I also doubt CBS will jeopardize the royalties they get paid for the use of their TOS characters, by confusing  NuTrek audiences with a different timeline.   And there are other factors that may not favour a return of the original timeline. With dismal sales on the Blu-ray editions of TNG, CBS may conclude that this market sector of the fandom is too small.  CBS Consumer Products may also want to protect the revenue from their current book lines, which have been officially continuing the original timeline since Nemesis.  STO could also be an unfavourable consideration.  But who knows.  I'm not right about a lot of things."

I kind of like it, as an example of how goofy the 1960s could be. From a canon perspective it's awful though.   The sets seemed non-existent   The show had like next to no budget. Most of Gary's computer was bits and pieces of the Atavachron and the M-5 Multitronic. Very few of ToS's sets would have been appropriate here, except maybe for some hallways.   and did Gary 7 have a sonic screwdriver?   I think it was more like the Penguin's parasol, since it could essentially drug people too.   Do they ever reveal what planet he's from?   Not in the show. Presumably that would be addressed in some degree in the show that was to be launched."

The books establish the Aegis as the alien race that abducted Gary Seven's ancestors.   The Aegis homeworld was located in a cloaked star system some fifty thousand light-years away from Earth. The planet was cosmopolitan and the Aegis had various advanced technologies, including long range transporters which allowed them to deploy their agents light-years away. They also had the ability to move their operatives through time.

So begins the documentary ""William Shatner Presents: Chaos on the Bridge"" that interviews all the major players involved in the creation of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Shatner interviews the studio presidents, executives, producers, writers, and actors involved in making TNG and charts the story of the first three seasons of the television series. The film concentrates on the late Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and his interactions in making Next Gen possible, interspersed with a country twang soundtrack and illustrations that depict those interactions from 1986 to 1990.     Darren, Phillip, and Daniel review the documentary itself and discuss their reactions to Shatner's interviews. They discuss Roddenberry's approach to Star Trek, how other people affected that vision for good and ill, and how all the ""behind the scenes"" conflict contributed to what we saw on screen from ""Encounter at Farpoint"" to ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I."" So ante up with your poker chips, get our your banjo, and join Earl Grey as they discuss ""Chaos on the Bridge."""

Treknobabble,3dmao4,StanleyRiver,2,Fri Jul 17 14:26:05 2015 UTC,"I feel as though there is a point to Worf being denied so many times.   He is a violent being, one who believes that a fist is a better way to solve problems than a discussion. This seems to fly in the face of everything TNG stands for.  While I will say that Worf may be correct some of the time but, like most things on Star Trek, it is principle that is the message. Worf is raw emotion and it is Picards job to reign in those emotions and weigh them against a more logical approach.   That being said Worf IS my favorite character."
Treknobabble,3dmao4,BestCaseSurvival,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"It probably has more to do with the fact that the security of the ship is his job. He's on the ship to put forth the options that will assure the safety of the ship and her crew. It's Picard's job to decide when those suggestions should be followed and when not.   If the Enterprise blew up everything weird they ever came across, the ship would never get blindsided by weird alien probes that knock the captain out and implant false information into his head that could be used to turn him into a sleeper agent and destroy the Federation."

It’s on a screen near you, but it isn’t coming from the studios you’d expect. The movement is Axanar, and it’s Star Trek that fans at conventions—seeing it on screen in the booth—have mistaken for the next TV series. After the success of Prelude, it’s time for the final push to film the full Axanar.  In this episode of The Ready Room, hosts C Bryan Jones and Norman C. Lao are joined by Axanar creator and executive producer Alec Peters and director Robert Meyer Burnett to discuss why they want to make the best independent Star Trek film you’ve ever seen, how they plan to do it, how you can help, and why they’re sure that the Star Trek universe really does exist.  In our news segment we discuss Adam Nimoy’s Kickstarter success, an official costume contest for Star Trek Las Vegas, and whether Star Trek 3 will pay homage to Star Trek V."

At least in the original Star Trek series, Spock needed to be in contact with someone to read their thoughts, and even Nimoy surmised that Vulcans had special nerve endings in their finger tips that made it possible.  As for the range, it seems limited to starship to starship encounter distance, or orbit distance when sensing people on planets.

Treknobabble,3covja,deadfraggle,12,Fri Jul 10 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"If the intention is simple destruction, you don't need the reassembly step of transporters, which is really the difficult part.  At that point, you basically just have a subspace beam weapon that disintegrates matter. The only advantage it would offer over a conventional phaser would be the ability to hit a target without damaging intervening objects, since the beam is actually travelling interdimensionally.  However, if the target has even low-level shielding, you won't be able to open a stable subspace corridor, which is why transporting through shields doesn't work."
Treknobabble,3covja,daeedorian,6,Thu Jul 9 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"I believe it was used once by a Kazon captain to kill another uncooperative Kazon captain when they first stole that technology from Voyager (They teleported him into space).  As for using it in battle, I was always under the impression that transporters used a lot of energy and their signals could be easily blocked by many different forms of radiation aside from a starship's shields. Not to mention that the aggressive ship's shields would have to be down in order to use it against the enemy ship, making them vulnerable. I imagine it's just a lot faster and more effective to use phasers and torpedoes.   However, if I recall correctly the use of transport pattern scramblers is a prohibited action, even in war, so maybe there's a space Geneva convention where everyone agrees its in the best interest of everyone to not go transporting each other into space."

Treknobabble,3covja,Eaders,6,Fri Jul 10 14:02:36 2015 UTC,DS9 had an episode in which an assassin used a mini transporter module (if memory serves) to snipe people from outside of the room.

There have been a couple of instances where a photon torpedo has been transported into an enemy ship, so maybe that counts as well.  I don't think it's easy to get a lock on/in an enemy ship while in battle due to their shields."

Treknobabble,3covja,deadfraggle,6,Thu Jul 9 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"It is so tempting, I think there should be at least one civ featured that successfully manages to overcome enemy shields and beams spaceships apart.  But even without this technology, sometimes the shields are down and even then nobody is using it. Also, why do they never store people in the buffers in case something happens to the original? Beaming is so underused..."
Treknobabble,3covja,deadfraggle,4,Thu Jul 9 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"Well, there was one instance where Data used a stored transporter pattern to recreate a body for Picard in ""Lonely Among Us"". O'Brien also suggests using a stored 'transporter trace' to restore an over-aged Pulaski in ""Unnatural Selection"". Storing mental patterns apparently takes a vast amount of computer memory, as seen in DS9: Our Man Bashir, but I'm not sure why everyone starfleet didn't have a stored body pattern on record for emergencies, or to stay physically young."

Treknobabble,3covja,bachrach44,2,Fri Jul 10 02:22:35 2015 UTC,The defiant frequently lost shields and had to rely on it's ablative armor. I remember at least one situation where it couldn't raise shields because it was beaming the new Cardassian government on board and the Klingons were firing at it.

Treknobabble,3covja,TistedLogic,2,Fri Jul 10 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. You wouldn't want to utterly destroy the enemy if your goal is assimilation.  The Borg's ultimate weapon is, imho, their collective consciousness. Billions of minds all thinking in the same direction. A single Borg cube has thousands of minds interlinked. They can process information far faster than the fastest starship computer and as a result only need one or two events to happen to generate a defence against said event."
Treknobabble,3covja,Monomorphic,4,Fri Jul 10 08:09:55 2015 UTC,Maybe it is a war crime. Certain weapons are banned by international agreement even now.  Perhaps using the transporter as a weapon is in the same category as the Varon-T disruptor or subspace weapons.

Treknobabble,3covja,LordFendleberry,2,Thu Jul 9 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"Tribbles multiplied fairly fast. Fast enough that the computer would have trouble locating all of them and transporting them. Missing even one would mean failure. Also, Prime Directive would probably prohibit spacing an entire colony of anything. Sentient or not.  EDIT: Reading around the web, I discovered that Scotty actually did this, except it was to a Klingon ship. Spacing them would be unethical.  The Borg have individual adaptive shielding. You might get one or two, but after that they'd adapt."
Treknobabble,3covja,bachrach44,2,Fri Jul 10 08:17:16 2015 UTC,"You can't use the transporters when the shields are up. Since it's protocol to raise shields when faced with a ship that may even remotely be hostile, it's doubtful that an enemy vessel would get the chance to use a transporter against a ship unless they were caught completely off guard. Additionally, beaming takes quite a bit of time (somewhere between 10 and 30 seconds, I think), so if a ship detected a beaming in process they could use all sorts of techniques to disrupt it (unless you're using the aforementioned brains strategy). Essentially, using the transporters as a weapon is just ungainly. It would be much more efficient to just blow the enemy ship out of the sky."
Treknobabble,3covja,BlueBlood620,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:36 2015 UTC,Stack Exchange took this up a little while ago - there are certainly some deadly possibilities - like beaming out something that powers the warp containment field (instant core breach) of putting a photon torpedo right next to the core. Or even just beaming the bridge crew into space. Or your brig if you prefer the non-lethal methods. http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/13539/why-cant-transporter-technology-be-used-as-a-weapon

For the first part of the series, they are joined by the author of The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion, Larry Nemecek, to break down Hurley's work on Star Trek. We discuss the behind-the-scenes climate of Season One, Hurley's contributions to the mythology, and his unused treatment for the film that would become Star Trek Generations.

Treknobabble,3c24yl,trekfm,2,Sat Jul 4 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"About this episode:  It all began with a just handful of ships.  Enterprise had the unique opportunity, as the prequel series, to introduce many of the origins of basic Star Trek canon; how M-Class was derived from the Vulcan word Minshara (with regard to classifying planets suitable for humanoid life), the first use of photon(ic) torpedoes, at times hinting of creating the Prime Directive, and of course the first Starship named Enterprise. And possibly most important, Enterprise sheds light on the proud, yet trepidatious birth of the first Human fleet that comprised all of the United Earth Space Probe Agency's (UESPA) scientific exploration and planetary defense vessels.  For those of you who have watched or are currently watching Enterprise, you may not realize that in certain episodes, you truly see the limited reach and scope of Starfleet's ships of the line - in the mid 22nd century, they were likely a little less than a dozen ships in total. So, in this episode, we'll be exploring the origins of the first ships of Earth's Starfleet and the United Earth Space Probe Agency; how and why they were necessary and their service status while Archer and the crew of the NX-01 were pushing Warp Five into deep space."
Treknobabble,3c3heu,SciFiOnscreen,2,Sat Jul 4 12:02:59 2015 UTC,"This gives me a great opportunity to complain about a very specific thing regarding this film. In particular, the Japanese subtitled version.  During the Valkris scene where Kruge appears and she transfers him over the Genesis report, she says in Klingon ""You will find it useful."" Kruge: ""Then you have seen it?!"" ""Yes, my lord.""   At this point, Kruge says, ""Unfortunate"". Now, this implies that she has seen something she shouldn't have, and will pay for it, although it isn't immediately known how. But the Japanese translation of this scene totally blows it: Instead of ""Unfortunate"" (which could have been translated as 残念だ in the same context with the same meaning), it's simply translated as 死ね。 ""Die.""  Now to me this totally ruins the scene because it gives away what Kruge is about to do, and spoils the tension. The scene is far more effective if the audience is left to figure out for themselves that Valkris (and the ship she's aboard) is gonna get blowed up real good.  This has irritated me for years and it's only now that I ever had the opportunity to vent about it to someone who might care. Thanks."

Phillip, Darren, and Daniel analyze how the movies and television episodes treat the issue of ageing in the 24th century. The inaugural TNG film, Star Trek: Generations, features Captain James T. Kirk dealing with life transitions (and death), Captain Jean-Luc Picard struggling with issues of family and mortality, and the antagonist Dr. Tolian Soran sacrificing entire planets to kill the ""predator"" of time. The third film, Star Trek: Insurrection, is centrally focused on the idea of a ""fountain of youth,"" and the Enterprise-E crew, as well as the Son'a and Baku, react to ""growing younger"" in different ways.   The Earl Grey trio also examine such episodes as ""Half a Life"" and ""Relics"" which pose questions about the treatment of older people in society. There are also the story-lines in ""Rascals"" that deal with ""lost youth,"" with both Ensign Ro and Picard struggling with the consequences of a second childhood. Along with ""Too Short a Season,"" this episode talks about bad ""old age"" make-up, being considered middle age on alien planets, and how certain scripts could have been improved."

Treknobabble,3bun1n,SarnXero,2,Thu Jul 2 07:56:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, DS9 should be watched in order. While TOS and TNG were very episodic with an adventure of the week format that sprang naturally from them being on exploratory vessels, DS9 is much more linear, as a result of centering on one station. It leads to a lot more character development, and long reaching storylines. Really, none of the series have anywhere near the level of character development we see in all of the main characters in DS9. That's the best part of the series IMO but it requires watching it in order to appreciate it."

Treknobabble,3blbtk,trekfm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"About this episode:  Deep Space Nine is often seen as that series about the war. But, in fact, the Dominion War didn’t really begin until the end of the fifth season. Squadrons of insect-like Dominion ships pouring out of the wormhole was the harbinger of the greatness and danger to come, and to a unique approach to Star Trek storytelling. The sixth season of DS9 was to begin not only with an unprecedented six-episode arc, but also with the scattering of our heroes and the loss of the space station whose very name is in the title of the show.  In this episode of The Orb, hosts C Bryan Jones and Matthew Rushing continue their series that takes you through the Season Six opener. This time around we delve into family with the episode that focuses on… well… sons and daughters. We discuss the tension between Worf and Alexander, how Worf struggles to be a father to a son who feels abandoned, and how Martok steps in to mentor them both. We also discuss Dukat’s decision to bring Ziyal back to the Station, the difficulties she faces, and how her separate relationships with both Dukat and Kira almost bring the two enemies together."

The other thing is, if you're totally new to it, we have what we call a 'Cadet Academy' which you can ask your GM to put you forward for which will teach you all the basics you need to get going. :)"

Just as fathers influence their children, Leonard Nimoy did this for millions around the world. And in this episode of The Ready Room, recorded on Father’s Day, hosts Christopher Jones and Larry Nemecek are joined by someone who knows this better than anyone: Leonard’s son, Adam. Currently working on a documentary called “For The Love of Spock,” Adam helps us all remember the incredible talent and influence that his father brought to the world as we discuss the project, his life growing up with a famous dad, his own work directing episodes of TNG, and much more.  In our news segment, we share our thoughts on the recent news that Paramount has invited a fan to pitch their idea for a TV series—previously called Star Trek Beyond, but now renamed Star Trek Uncharted. We also check in on Nichelle Nichols’s recovery, and Mike Rittenhouse and Noah Butler of the band Five Year Mission drop by to preview their upcoming EP release, “Spock’s Brain.”"

Treknobabble,3avwl0,Game-On,4,Wed Jun 24 00:27:58 2015 UTC,Exactly.  He did her a bigger favor than anyone else in the show.
Treknobabble,3avwl0,madcowbomber,4,Wed Jun 24 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"I always took him to be tip top as a military style leader. If you take a big group of recruits, break their spirits, deconstruct their own self image, and rebuild them to be soldiers, you want a guy like Jellico to lead them. He optimizes, makes people useful, and can ultimately draw a sense of accomplishment through a series of successes won through clockwork behavior.  Starfleet personnel are highly educated, highly disciplined, and extremely diverse, coming from hundreds of unrelated species. At no point is it made evident that they going through anything like boot camp. They're not trained to act like clockwork. They apply individualistic thinking in a framework mandated by Starfleet.  Jallico was, perhaps, thinking in a 22nd century way. It's a great approach but Picard has the holy grail, a balance between tight discipline and individual freedom to do what's right. His leadership is the kind of thing you'd never be able to get right unless you were, say, captain of the flagship of the most awesome collection of peoples in the galaxy. And Jellico tried to follow that act without grace."
Treknobabble,3avwl0,chimney3,3,Wed Jun 24 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way... he was chosen as Picard's replacement for a reason. He was what was needed for the enterprise at that time, and he went with his own methods that had to have been proven to work. He was stern, but he had to be. Otherwise Riker would have stomped over his authority."
Treknobabble,3avwl0,Kronos6948,3,Wed Jun 24 11:32:00 2015 UTC,"""Kickass"" sounds about right. If I were on a ship during the Cardassian war or something, I'd want it to be under Jellico because I'd live longer and get more done.  If he'd stayed on the Enterprise D longer, though, he'd have started receiving regular complaints. For example, his 4-shift rotation, presumably meaning 6-hour shifts instead of 8, are great for having people be more alert at work, but it would piss off any officer with a family because lining up a schedule with theirs becomes really hard. Assuming 40-ish hour work weeks, that's 8 hr. for 5 days under Picard or 6 hr. for 6-7 days under Jellico. People with families would want a day or two off each week, meaning double shifts that presumably can't be taken as a 12-hour stretch (by humans anyway). I doubt that Picard hadn't considered the restructuring Jellico implemented; he just had a better understanding of what kind of ship he was running."
Treknobabble,3avwl0,misho88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Oddly, reading this, I thought of Chakotay saying ""A Captain doesn't choose their mission, the mission chooses them.""

Treknobabble,3ak979,trekfm,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"About this episode:  The Temporal Cold War was a promising, yet inconsistent storytelling device throughout the four seasons of Enterprise. Despite its many narrative challenges, the Temporal Cold War did provide the series with a few interesting world-building elements, in particular - the agents of the Temporal Accords; pawns of a greater and more far reaching endgame. So we have circled back to the Future Guy, trying to pierce his veil of mystery and that of the faction or agency for which he served. (cough) Tal'Shiar (cough)  During 2009's Star Trek VegasCon, former Enterprise show runners Manny Coto and Brannon Braga stated that Future Guy was trending towards being a Romulan agent because this would have created an opportunity to tie him into the famed Romulan War, instigating certain events in Archer's time. Years later, Braga tweeted in 2012, that Future Guy was supposed to be Archer all along - trying to right his own wrongs when he was Captain of the NX-01! Join us in the Conference Room as we delve deeper into what could have been the catalyst of the Romulan War!"

Treknobabble,3aibds,thesynod,2,Sat Jun 20 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"Where is it written that you need action to make a scifi movie?  Star Trek IV had almost zero action, and it was great.  Interstellar had very little action and it was amazing, and remember when Dave beat up HAL in 2001?  Of course not, because it was a great movie, not action movie dribble.  Star Trek is better than that.  And it continues with the high quality fan made Trek.  And I'll put those fan made episodes against Enterprise or Voyager and win every time.  We love Trek.  We love the universe, we love the characters and the stories.  Paramount sees it as a poorly performing asset, nothing more."

Treknobabble,3aibds,neoteotihuacan,3,Sat Jun 20 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"Stargate Atlantis lasted 5 years, and its central conceit was it took place in another Galaxy.   The problem with Beyond/Uncharted isn't that, its the shitty characters and hackneyed backstory which somehow is set on the Enterprise-A but in the mid 25th Century - that not only shits over Prime Trek, but also any hint of progress NuTrek might ever have - I mean, if 5 Enterprises could be made in 100 years between TOS and TNG, why the hell would there only be 2 in 200 years? Even if no ships are lost - technological progress is a core tenet of Star Trek, that back story just screams stagnation to me.   As for the plot, you could do almost anything and have it be a good show, you just need to come at it from an interesting angle. Just exploring a new make believe galaxy (yes, andromeda is real but the show is make believe) isn't interesting. It needs a mystery box.   Shit on JJ all you want for failing to grasp what makes Trek tick, but when the dude made a TV show he gave them a secret sauce that kept them going for years. Without that, ANY project is doomed to fail."

There could be large gaps between them.  Plus the ships don't have to be cutting edge all the time.  An older ship could be used as a patrol ship or a training vessel for a while.  That's what happened to Enterprise-nil even after the refit."

""Encounter at Farpoint"" inaugurates the seven seasons of TNG on television with the accusation that humanity is a ""dangerous, savage, child race."" While the two-hour pilot attempts to refute that charge, the missions of the Enterprise-D can be seen through the lens of those accusations. The finale of ""All Good Things..."" sees Judge Q telling Captain Jean-Luc Picard that the trial never reached a verdict ... until now, and that humanity is found guilty of being ""inferior."" Once again, the Next Gen crew must solve a puzzle, one that spans three different time periods, in order to prove that humanity has indeed evolved.  Daniel, Darren, and Phillip join the jury in examining how Q's trial informs what we learn from our favorite Trek series. Do we believe this crew best represents 24th Century humanity? And does humanity simply refer to Terrans or to all of the flagship crew, from andriods to Klingons to Betazoids? Are the ""criminal"" accusations the same or different in both the pilot and the series finale? Earl Grey deliberates on a verdict of humanity's fate in this episode spanning the entire television run of TNG."

This time, things are different. In this episode of To The Journey, Char and Tristan rewrite ""Extreme Risk"" with one major change: Janeway takes B'Elanna's place as the character who's numbed from depression. Since Janeway was dealing with depression in ""Night,"" Voyager's Season Five opener, it seemed natural fit to continue the storyline. ""Extreme Risk"" was an excellent episode as produced, so how much really changes when a different character has to deal with the same set of circumstances? Listen on and find out."

However, many times in The Next Generation, Picard and his first officer Will Riker turn over command to other members of their crew. Phillip, Daniel, and Darren analyze the command styles of the other personnel who sat in the center seat of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and other starships, during various missions.   They study second officer Lt. Commander Data's command tenure on both the Enterprise and the Sutherland (""Redemption, Part 2"" and ""Gambit, Parts 1 and 2""), Commander Beverly Crusher's time in the captain's chair (""Descent, Parts 1 and 2"" and ""All Good Things...""), Lt. Commander Deanna Troi's turn in command (""Disaster""), and Lieutenant junior grade Geordi LaForge's time as acting captain (""Arsenal of Freedom""). Earl Grey also discusses that other captain of the Enterprise-D, Captain Edward Jellico (""Chain of Command, Parts 1 and 2"").   How did these commanders handle people? What challenges did many of them overcome as first time captains? How many of them consulted Livingston for advice in the ready room?

If you've never played this type of game before, I'd recommend joining up as a crew member on an existing ship before thinking about your own- that lets you get to grips with how the games work.  So...  Our games work in novel format where you write collaboratively with other players to help tell the story set by the game manager. You develop your own character and tell their story over time too.  Imagine each individual game as being its own series of Star Trek, each with its own unique quirks and characters. We have games stretching from the Enterprise era, all the way through the movie era, post-Nemesis and beyond!  The best way to get involved is to create a character.   If you go to our application page you'll be able to apply to be placed on any of the games we have.   You fill out your character's biography (the more detailed the better), then we place you on the best game for you. You can select your top 3 positions and your top 3 ship classes, or even a specific game. The choice is yours.  APPLY NOW!  As I said above, I'm happy to help you out if anyone has any questions. :)"

Even after the release of Star Trek’s original pilot “The Cage” in 1988, fans had to rely on books and comics to learn more about the character played by Jeffrey Hunter. Then came J.J. Abrams, who put Pike in the center seat—for a bit. Thanks to this, even casual Star Trek fans are now familiar with the officer that die-hards have longed to see fleshed out.  In this episode of Continuing Mission, new host Eric Brasure is joined by someone attempting to do just that: Todd Shawn Tei. As the producer of the new independent film project Star Trek: Captain Pike, Todd is drawing upon elements of the captain’s life that have been revealed through the expanded universe—along with his own unique take—to tell Pike’s story. Co-writing with him is none other than Walter Koenig, and the film has signed on a star-studded cast of faces familiar to all Star Trek fans. Together with Shawn, we delve deeper into the project."

Based on the book by H.G. Wells, the series was a modern retelling of the sci-fi classic, about a scientist who accidentally turns himself invisible.  In this episode of Commentary: Trek Stars, Mike and John take a look at Bennett's second series. We discuss our thoughts on the show, the changes that were made after the pilot, and their second attempt at adapting the novel. We also discuss expanded elements from the Star Trek IV novelization."

With only a split second to decide his own fate, Q chose to be made human and sent to the ship of his only friend in the universe: Jean Luc Picard. But was this really a good idea?  In this episode of The Ready Room, we’re joined by Will Nguyen, Andi VanderKolk, and Daniel Handlin to discuss the third-season TNG episode “Déjà Q.” We take a look at the cruel and unusual punishment meted out by Q’s fellow superfriends, how he handles terrifying experiences like getting hungry and falling asleep, and what he learns about being human from Data. We also reach into the Magic Bag of B-Plot Crises and pull out the “falling moon” card… just like the writers!  In our news segment, we share our thoughts on Simon Pegg’s comments that Paramount found Orci’s original Star Trek 3 script “too Trek-y,” what the Chinese starship building really looks like to us, and the potential of the upcoming game Star Trek Timelines. Plus, stick around for the closing segment where we discuss listener feedback about a new Star Trek series and CBS All Access."
Treknobabble,381b7g,CrewmanMathews,17,Mon Jun 1 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"Not to be cynical, but not watching something is not really going to help more of another thing to come back.  I've been trying to avoid all Reality shows and NCIS spin offs.  But after 15 years, those thing certainly haven't gone away.  And Star Trek hasn't returned either.  But this article brings up a lot of good points.  Especially hitting on something I noticed back in the late 90s.  It is not constant rip offs that are break out hits.  Something like NCIS New Orleans or Survivor 47 take TONS of marketing and hype to support them.  But when something genuinely unique comes out, people do flock to it.  Wither its Star Trek, The Jeffersons, The Simpsons, MASH, Frasier, The West Wing or yes, even the Big Bang Theory.  People run to those shows because frankly, its something different from the 50 clone shows on TV at the time.  Then, seeing the break out success of that unique show, networks all try to make their clones of it and run a good concept into the ground.  Sorry guys, but Scandal is not going to fill my West Wing fix just because they keep showing the White House.  Its absolutely horrible.  But, as the article said, there's no incentive for networks to try new gambles as long as the top rated shows currently are established series and clone shows.  Scandal is still doing well...so they'll keep making it instead of something unique.  The sad thing is, Star Trek is kind of caught in the middle.  It pioneered dramatic storytelling back in the day and IS a known IP.  But at the same time, it is not a niche British Drama, Game of Thrones knock off or a Detective drama.  In other words, SciFi drama is not the 'it' concept right now.  So studios don't want to take a chance on it.  I certainly hope this changes soon.  Heck, I've been waiting 15 years for the market to change.  Please change....please......"
Treknobabble,381b7g,maxis2k,31,Mon Jun 1 07:23:20 2015 UTC,You shouldn't watch that show even if you don't like Trek. It's just objectively bad.
Treknobabble,381b7g,ayures,5,Mon Jun 1 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"My understanding, having seen very little of it, is that it's funny for people are absolutely not nerdy at all but are vaguely nerd aware; for example, people who know a trekkie or people who used to have room mates who were into Star Wars.  And I guess that's like a big enough demographic."
Treknobabble,381b7g,chimney3,3,Mon Jun 1 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of media (especially commercials) seem to be targeting the kids who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.  Big Bang Theory seems to be heavily targeting these people, who are now in their late 20s-late 30s.  So yes, a lot of younger kids look at the Big Bang Theory and laugh at their lack of knowledge of true nerd culture.  But most of the people from the previous two gens don't notice.  The best example I can come up with is the show constantly trying to reference current video games (Red Dead Redemption, GTA, World of Warcraft, etc).  But anyone who is a fan of those games would just laugh at how inaccurate their reference is.  But at the same time, someone who doesn't spend a lot of time playing games and casually knows about GTA or Wii Sports will still get the reference.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, The Big Bang Theory is not aimed at nerds.  Its aimed at the people who want to laugh at nerd culture.  So obviously true video game players, comic book fans or scientists will probably dismiss or even be offended by the show.  But people who aren't so uptight about those things will laugh at it.  It's no different than a show focused on race relations or a show focused on an uptight psychiatrist.  They just changed the theme.  But in defense of the show, it also has a lot of non nerd references.  At its core, the focus of the show is still about the characters and how they develop.  The show actually makes far more references to sex and drinking than anything 'nerdy'.  Which means it can target the same demographic as pretty much all SitComs out today.  It just also has the nerd stuff to make it seem a little more unique.  Edit: For the record, really sad references to video games and nerd culture doesn't just stop at The Big Bang Theory.   If I had a nickel for every time I saw a 'serious' detective drama try to reference video games or Star Wars, I could produce my own show.  Even Elementary did it last season.  And CSI Cyber made it the whole theme of the show."

The Mod Squad, creator Harve Bennett's first television series, told the story of three young undercover police officers who were used to infiltrate criminal activity in an ever-changing world.  In this episode of Commentary: Trek Stars, John and Mike take a look at The Mod Squad. We discuss the similarities and differences to other police shows at the time, how it reflected the changing television landscape, and the thematic parallels to Star Trek. We also try to figure out what's going on in the opening title sequence."

Little did anyone know that these two shows would continue for so long or become such a part of the cultural zeitgeist. Yet the two franchises would not be brought together until 2012 in the form of a comic crossover.   In this episode of Literary Treks, hosts Matthew Rushing and Dan Gunther talk about the Star Trek: The Next Generation and Doctor Who crossover comic, Assimilation². We discuss the post Wolf 359 Federation, the timeline of the story, being a Doctor Who fan verses a novice, whether Guinan is part Time Lord, the art, crossovers in general, and give our ratings.

Treknobabble,36zz2t,trekfm,1 point,Sat May 23 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"About this episode:  On Warp Five, we often talk about the important role that Jonathan Archer had as Captain of the NX-01. Since he was the first Starfleet Captain for the first Warp Five capable ship, he didn't have the luxury of Captain's Logs or the precedents laid by the commanders before him. While it's true that Archer often had to rely on his own training and instincts, it is also true that he wasn't completely without contemporaries. Even though he was Captain of the Enterprise, he still had colleagues and friends in command of other ships and areas within Starfleet.  In this episode, we're going to take a closer look at the other Captains seen on the series Enterprise...not named Jonathan Archer; more specifically A.G. Robinson and Erika Hernandez (and even Captain Gardner to a smaller degree). What can their experiences tell us about Starfleet in the 22nd century? Would Captain Hernandez's role have been expanded if the series had continued beyond Season 4? Or...how would circumstances have been different if Robinson or Hernandez were given command of the NX-01 instead of Archer? Join us for all this and more!"

If there’s great Star Trek being produced, you can bet David is nearby.

Treknobabble,36pdem,maksull,1 point,Thu May 21 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"About this episode:  Just as in contemporary times, war can take many forms. Star Trek: The Next Generation did not feature a primary war akin to those stories featured in Deep Space Nine or Enterprise, however many enemies confronted Captain Picard and his crew. The Romulan Empire posed a continuing threat to the United Federation of Planets that stood on the brink of war (""The Defector""), the results of the off-screen Cardassian War became a source of many episodes (""The Wounded,"" ""Chain of Command, Parts 1 and 2,"" ""Journey's End,"" and ""Preemptive Strike""), and the Borg presented a new form of warfare heretofore unknown to the 24th Century (""I, Borg"" and ""Descent, Parts 1 and 2"").   Phillip, Daniel, and Darren explore whether there are modern parallels to the ""post-Wolf 359"" era of TNG, how its combat/conflict compares to other Trek series, and how the serious potential for galactic war was continuously tackled by the flagship U.S.S. Enterprise. Come sing a mournful ballad of ""The Minstrel Boy"" and join Earl Grey as they discuss the role of war in Next Gen."

Treknobabble,36kv7u,Maculous,2,Wed May 20 11:01:04 2015 UTC,Originally she was supposed to be Sisco's first officer. They created Kira for that role however.

After all, the biggest dramatic moments were all callbacks to movies from the 80s. I'm a big fan of the series, and even I kinda felt like 'why are we retreading this stuff when only the biggest fans care about referencing these iconic moments'.  The whole thing felt way too self-referential."
Treknobabble,36im89,OccupyGravelpit,9,Tue May 19 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. The Khan reveal itself was insane, there was no context provided for why the characters should care who he is (which is kind of funny since the characters are actually supposed to be the ones who know the significance of who he is and provide context for the audience, but they had no idea or reaction to his name and didn't seem to care). The reveal was purely for the audience. Hell, I'm kind of surprised he didn't look into the camera and wink as he said it.  Both movies were a bunch wink-wink references saying, ""See? We watched the old stuff and can reproduce it, aren't you impressed?"" while completely misunderstanding the substance of the world itself. And now reading about this news coming from ""One of Us"" Pegg himself, sigh... I fear my favorite body of fiction might be dead for good, instead reanimated into this new slobbering, zombie version of itself. :("
Treknobabble,36im89,scottpie,2,Wed May 20 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   The thing I don't understand is that the tenor of the article was more ""Sorry, Trek people, that didn't fly. No more of that for you!"" as if the inside-baseball, rehashing part was something we wanted and are being told wasn't cool enough.  Personally speaking, I didn't want a rehash of the 80s stuff. Didn't ask for it, nobody's offending me by ""taking it away""."

So, okay, there's this planet where one of the crew- who we thought was dead- has come back to life. And.. okay, get this- the crew has to steal the Enterprise to go get their friend back.  And they're on the run from their own side AND they're fighting these Klingons, and at the end, someone kicks the head Klingon off a cliffside, shouting ""I! Am sick! of YOU!"".  Somewhere in the middle, they blow the Enterprise UP. It'll be hella metal. And then we rock on into the credits.  It'll make about $366 million in 2015 dollars.

We discuss his Star Trek story, coming up with new adventures, his influences, writing the TOS cast and having them working together, dovetailing with his first book, the psychology of Star Trek, and where to find him online.  In the news segment, we take a look at the newest Titan novel cover and talk about the blurb."

It’s the first time travel story that most fans remember (sorry “Naked Time” and “Tomorrow Is Yesterday”) and made screwing with the past cool long before it became Star Trek’s go-to trope. But, as a story that really lacks most of what makes TOS what it is, why does this story transcend time?  In this episode of The Ready Room, we’re joined by Phillip Gilfus, Andi VanderKolk, and Daniel Proulx to seek out the answer. We explore the premise, the time travel mechanism, soft-focus lighting, Edith Keeler’s place in time, Kirk’s dilemma, and what the story might have been like had it been set in Chicago—as Harlan Ellison originally wrote it. And, along the way, we find all the culture. Or at least most of it.  In our news segment, we share our thoughts on Jonathan Frakes’s recent comments about Star Trek not returning to television, and we remember the woman who, with her beehive hair and just eight appearances, helped define The Original Series."

Darren, Daniel, and Phillip go ""OUTATIME"" in this episode, exploring episodes including ""Timescape,"" ""Cause and Effect,"" ""Time Squared,"" ""Time's Arrow, Parts 1 and 2,"" and Star Trek: First Contact.   The Earl Grey trio break down all the times Captain Jean-Luc Picard would have been visited by the laugh-a-minute members of the Federation's Temporal Investigations unit with TNG's experiences with time loops, temporal anomalies, and Q's TARDIS-like powers. Prepare to experience a ""Quantum Leap"" of traveling across the space-time continuum with the Enterprise-D 's ""Excellent Adventure"" as they try to avoid predestination-paradoxes, and enjoy this episode about TNG and time travel."

There was never a race on Star Trek as stubborn, as prideful, abrasive, insulting and literally (and figuratively) pig-headed…and these are their “good” qualities! Arguably one of the more interesting races in Star Trek, the Tellarites have long been a fan favorite presumably for one simple reason: They were one of the four founding members of the Coalition of Planets who–alongside the Humans of Starfleet, the Vulcans and the Andorians–helped shape the future of what would eventually become the United Federation of Planets.  For the Star Trek fan that caught their first glimpse of a Tellarite in the classic Original Series episode ""Journey to Babel"", curiosity about them has always been consistently high. Since that episode, there have only been a sprinkling of Tellarite sightings, but they never were truly given their respectful due as a race of such historical significance...until Season 4 of Enterprise. So please join me, Will and Tommy as we try to unravel the mystery of the Tellarites as we speculate as to why this pivotal race to the history of the Federation was so entirely underrepresented."

Eventually someone is going to create a new series. It's just a question of when. In the meantime there are 30 seasons of rewatchable material.

In my personal opinion, CBS might revisit a new series when the money from TOS/TNG/DS9/VOY remake dvd sales + merch, as well as the crappy perfect-world MMO start to dry up.  CBS just put a bunch of money into remastering the old series for dvd/streaming however and probably want to recoup that investment before diluting the trek market with a risky spin off.   If they want to use the abramsverse lore/actors they will also have to pony up to paramount, otherwise the startrek series we get wouldn't be a continuation of what we see in theaters, making it even riskier."

Treknobabble,35tth3,Stormygeddon,7,Wed May 13 17:03:13 2015 UTC,I think DS9 and Enterprise both did a great job with story arcs. I don't see why a new series couldn't go for the more serialized format that has become popular.
Treknobabble,35tth3,troytleart,7,Wed May 13 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"I think Star Trek would be right at home on Netflix where production/time costs would be less because the cast can bang out an entire season quickly and move on to other things.  I think an Anthology style format (where each season is it's own self contained miniseries) is perfect for Star Trek, because it a lot of times they are trying to make points and tell stories that are just too massive for a single 50 minute episode to convey. You can get better actors because the time investment isn't nearly as substantial, and there would be real drama with the characters (because obviously in the old series' we know that none of the main cast is ever going to die, it's always going to be anonymous red shirt who dies which really kills the suspense)"

Treknobabble,35tth3,OccupyGravelpit,3,Wed May 13 18:08:32 2015 UTC,"Ok. That's a fair question. I think that, wether non-episodical shows are more ""catching"" now, there's still a big audience willing to follow episodical shows (CSI-like shows, Elementary, Doctor Who...) and also there's the possibility of making the new Star Trek series a bit less episodical. In fact, Enterprise started to show sintoms of this in it's last seasons. I think it will be possible and interesting."

I thought he was a clueless inept daddys boy who somehow got a starship through neptotism, but when I saw the episode where he escorted/protected the vulcan I finally respected him. He isn't kirk, he isn't picard, he isn't janeway, and he certainly isn't a sisko. However, he is is own kind of captain, and that is exactly what you want. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if they tried to make him a copy of the other captians. Heck, at lest he isn't insane, and didn't DIE 17 times like janeway!

This explains the magic resets after massive damage, inconsistencies, out of orderedness, and contradictions.   The final episode of enterprise only solidified this for me, revealing enterprise to also be a holonovel-version.   This was even explored in an episode of voyager where we see the EMH's version of the story, which is sold to the masses back home. I'm sure each character in the story had their own version of events. All the personal logs where recorded and arrived home with voyager, the inconsistent logs where compiled together, dramatic/propaganda/security edits where made, and the holonovels released to the public.  Much like Tom Paris had a slightly distorted view of the past, from his viewings of our media, we have a distorted view of what 'really' happened on the star trek shows."

Each story would build on the next as Kirk and his crew dealt with the aftermath of a disaster on the planet Mestiko.  In this episode of Literary Treks, hosts Matthew Rushing and Dan Gunther talk about the first book in the Mere Anarchy series: Things Fall Apart. We discuss the setting, the dilemma of the people on Mestiko, Kirk's burden, The Prime Directive, and the series long game.

Star Trek fan films and independent productions are flourishing today, but more than a decade ago James Cawley set forth as a true pioneer. Star Trek: New Voyages, now known as Phase II, was the first to chart the territory that makes Axanar possible. Cawley truly is the father of Star Trek fan films.  In this episode of the official Axanar podcast, hosts Robert Meyer Burnett and Alec Peters are joined by James to discuss why he decided to create his own stories, the experience of shooting new Star Trek, what makes a great fan film, what he has planned for the 50th anniversary and beyond, and his advice to Axanar.  In our news segment, Alec and Rob recount Axanar’s awards haul from Treklanta, the now-available digital download of Prelude to Axanar, more perks, an update on bridge construction, and more!"

Kirk and Spock shared a deep and intricate friendship that went far beyond duty. Picard and Riker always knew they could count on each other. Sisko and Kira used the differences in their points of view to see the bigger picture together and make well-rounded decisions. And Janeway had Chakotay, who was not just her first officer, but the person she eventually trusted most on the ship, developed a deep friendship with...and possibly more? The Voyager writers toyed with the idea of a Janeway/Chakotay romance when fans vocally took note of Mulgrew and Beltran's onscreen chemistry. Though the writers didn't fully go through with the idea, they gave the ""J/Cers"" moments that launched thousands of fanfics. In this episode of To The Journey, Char and Tristan list their top five Janeway/Chakotay relationshipper moments and try not to squee too much in the process."

In fact, it delivered what is considered by many to be the best hour of DS9—and one of the best in the entire franchise—with “In the Pale Moonlight.” But it also gave us what is widely considered to be DS9’s worst: “Profit and Lace.”  In this episode of The Orb, hosts Christopher Jones and Matthew Rushing step out of their usual world of serious discussion and into the Bosom Buddies reality, where Quark is a woman and Doctor Bashir performs gender-altering operations in the name of Ferengi politics.

But at the same time these are all more than just fun little projects. These shows are proof of concept that there ARE new frontiers, there are new dynamics to explore.

Treknobabble,3583n1,sudin,15,Thu May 7 22:03:25 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that's a reference. I'm willing to bet you can find plenty of low shots of action heroes holding guns. Additionally it looks like the Janeway shot is using a wide angled lens while the shot of Ripley is using a telephoto lens. That puts the focus on Ripley's face which is also lit specifically to draw your eye to her face. Janeway is lit from underneath with acccents her gun and makes it more of a threatening gesture.  I could be wrong about the lens.
Treknobabble,3583n1,mnky9800n,4,Thu May 7 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well it's that whole scene, the concept of alien invaders and the  solitary woman preparing to go into the thick of it, that whole strapping of weapons sequence that comes before this screenshot, I thought all of that made this a solid reference, not just this single pose with a weapon held ready."
Treknobabble,3583n1,mnky9800n,2,Fri May 8 05:21:35 2015 UTC,"Or it could just be something to tie into the whole combat obsessed movie named First Contact that just came out a month before. Picard wears a very similar outfit while fighting borg queens.  I guess my point is that if it is a reference, it's a bad one because of the way they setup the shot. And Voyager had plenty of money to get the shot right."

By the time IV happens, it seems like the cast shouldn't have the jobs they have anymore because they are kind of long in the tooth. But because they are thrown into the problem it all works for me. I also thought it was great because one of the goals of writing the story was ""never have someone fire a phaser"".

Treknobabble,34whua,Magiobiwan,2,Tue May 5 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"That too. However, compared to the remastered HD version, the original VHS/DVD releases look so much less good. The colors in the remastered versions are MUCH more vibrant and aren't dulled out due to broadcast color limitations. Red uniforms look MUCH more RED. Gold looks more GOLD. Blue actually looks BLUE. Overall it's a MASSIVE difference."

Treknobabble,34whua,SuperTallCraig,1 point,Tue May 5 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"She provided the regular voice of the onboard computers of Federation starships for Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, and most of the Star Trek movies. She reprised her role as a shipboard computer's voice in two episodes of the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise, thus making her the only actor to have a role in all six televised Star Trek series. She also lent her voice to various computer games and software related to the franchise. The iconic association of her voice to interactions with computers led to Google's Assistant project being initially codenamed Google Majel."
Treknobabble,34whua,Chevex,7,Tue May 5 20:23:43 2015 UTC,He's definitely annoyed in that scene. The only reason he made a fool of himself was to save her life. He clearly did not enjoy it.

Treknobabble,34s6dj,trekbette,4,Mon May 4 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'm glad the gulf between fanbases is shrinking.  I don't understand why you can't love both.  I'm a huge Original Trilogy nerd, and tons of the Expanded Universe stuff is awesome.  Zahn's trillogy of books are especially awesome; but I also watch an episode or two of one Trek or another at least every other day or sometimes, everyday.  Regardless, they're two different animals.  Star Wars, at least the original trilogy, is a modern day Epic that I believe will, in the future, be spoken of in the same sentance as Homer's Odyssey.  Star Trek is a serialized look at a near-utopian future which we get to explore along with one crew or another.   That all being said...  people who argue that the Death Star would win VS. The Borg have ABSOLUTELY no idea what they're talking about and would be among the first to be assimilated.   Resistance is Futile."
