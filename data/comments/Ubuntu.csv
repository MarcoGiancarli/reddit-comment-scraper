Their OSS drivers are a bit further behind, but they have similar plans for the future when you're comparing them with AMD just because it'd make compatibility easier and it would be sharing the work with the OSS driver vendors. Right now, the reason AMD falls so far behind is because they likely don't share code from their Windows driver like Nvidia does, and their OpenGL implementation is just straight worse. (even on Windows, AMD's OpenGL performance falls behind Nvidia's)   The 7970 on Windows was much more comparable to a 680 than a 660, but I believe it'd be relatively close to a 960 nowadays.

Ubuntu,3dz4jm,OscarZetaAcosta,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for asking this very good question. Why are people voting you down? You did not say anything to disrespect Linux or its user base. I for one used to use Linux 100% of the time, but due to constant over heating of my previous laptops when using Linux, I bought a Mac and I am very happy with it and OS X which I find it very pleasing to use and very refined.   Regarding your question, I consider myself neutral as I have used both systems and like certain aspects to each OS. I think some may prefer Linux or Ubuntu because of the following:   Linux is more flexible: You can tweak things, change them to your liking very easily, unlike OS X, where this can be very difficult to do. Some people like this, some find it time consuming and bewildering, matter of personal taste. Open Source: Huge array of open/free software. Yes, they can be lower quality than commercial counterparts (but sometimes even better), but they often do the intended job very nicely.  Require less resources: If your mac is aging, and require it to be more speedy, you can install a lighter Linux version that can revitalize your mac/pc and extend its life. Hardware requirements tend to be lower for Linux. Security: Although OS X is more secure than Windows. Linux is still more secure than both.  Command line: Linux is superior in this area."

I do a lot of enterprise development all locally on my laptop with apache, database, ide and all associated development stuff.  Two things made me ditch osx, 1. It was slower, seemed to use a substantial amount more memory.  2.  All though the command line is ok things like not being case sensitive, different layouts for dir's and the hiding of system stuff from there user just make it feel a bit like I'm not totally in control. Maybe an analogy would be a manual to an automatic car.

So because you personally see no point to it, does that make it pointless for everyone else? But as for reasons why? Where to begin? Because I wanted too see what a free OS was like on a competent laptop. Because I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could do it. Because I find it fun and enjoyable. Because I wanted options. Because I like Ubuntu and like the Linux community. There's loads of reasons why I made this choice, but honestly the most important one (for me personally) is this: Linux forces your to gain a better understanding of how a computer and an operating system work. If something goes wrong in Windows or OS X, maybe you just click an update or double click to install an application. This is not the case for Linux. Sure, it's less stable and less user friendly and this puts off many people, and understandably so. But I like a challenge, and Linux makes me, as someone that didn't study computers/IT/programming, understand how these devices work. In the install process alone I learned about how booting works, .config files, and how to use console commands to create files and edit basic lines of code. Linux forces you to learn these things, otherwise various bugs and issues persist. I now know more about computers from just installing Ubuntu on a computer with a relatively closed down boot loader. So for me, it is very rewarding and I find it fun.   Why do people drive old Mustangs from the 1960's that constantly breakdown, when their newer, faster BMW is arguably better? Because they enjoy it, they like the tinkering, and it forces them to understand how cars work."

Why do people drive old Mustangs from the 1960's that constantly breakdown   Perfectly valid point. If you want fuck with computers Ubuntu is perfect choice.

I've never met a causal, ""normal person"" that runs Linux. I can't imagine having to tell my dad or girlfriend how to install a program via the terminal. Honestly most people don't even know the simplest things about computers or technology. Shit, I don't know that much, and even still, it seems like more than most ""regular"" people. I was explaining to my friend about what VPN's are the other day and he basically thought I was some kind of hacker. My only friends that use Linux work in computer related fields. Most people want a OS that just works, lets them browse Facebook, and installing an app is as easy as dragging and dropping a file.

I have run some flavor of Ubuntu single boot on a 2009 MacBook Pro 17"", 2012 MacBook Air 13"", and 2014 MacBook Pro Retina 15"" each with maxed out specs. The first two ran Ubuntu beautifully and my only complaints with the 2012 were that some programs were not well designed to run on the smaller display and the Wi-Fi would flicker on and off a few times a day. For the 2012 in particular, I was really impressed. I used the machine heavily for Android development and it ran virtual machines and emulators like a champ.  The 2014, which I'm typing this comment on, runs but there are a lot of shortcomings. The biggest one is that the GPU never seems to power off. The laptop is constantly toasty although the CPU usage is low and I get up to two hours battery life just browsing the web. The Wi-Fi flickers on and off a few times a day but that's ok. I have to boot my kernel with the special ""device_nomsi=0x1600144d"" option to get standard disk speeds but I'm told it circumvents corruption safety options[0] of ext3/4 filesystem. The overall performance has not impressed me and I miss the smaller form factor of the Air. The builtin webcam is connected via PCI, not USB, and no driver exists. I tried a number of different distributions but they really, really, REALLY look like trash on a retina display. The scaling is very inconsistent with the window buttons being almost either universally teeny weeny or just appear unappealing in some way. I'm happy to have found that Linux Mint has wonderful built in high DPI support. I'm currently using Cinnamon but will try MATE maybe next weekend. Suspend and hibernate are always a bit dicey and the 2014 is no exception.  If this is the future of Linux on Apple machines, I will seek an Ultrabook or equivalent for my next machine.

It doesn't work so hot; the virtual machine will freeze after copying anywhere between  300-600 songs. This was better than running Windows 7 in VirtualBox, as I could only get a max of 200 songs before it froze. It seemed to work much much better if I used WiFi sync instead of using the USB cable. Much better. It works great if you don't add large amounts of music to your library regularly.  Here's what I do in a little more detail:   Get VirtualBox up and running. This can take a little bit of work. You need the VirtualBox Guest Additions ""CD"". You also need The Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. You will need to set up a shared folder. This is tricky but possible with Windows 10. I followed a tutorial that worked, but I can't find it :( It had to do with disabling 3D graphic something-or-other and then running the guest additions .exe in your virtual CD drive. Inside iTunes' preferences, set your music library location to a directory inside the folder you shared. It will show up in your windows explorer as a network drive. Every now and then, iTunes will change the music library location back to its default. So I've gotten into the habit of checking this every time I run iTunes. I move the music I want to import into the top level shared folder. Then I select the ""Import music from folder"" option in the menu bar. Then you want to select the Library>Organize Music Library>Consolidate files option. In Rhythmbox, I set my music library location to the same directory as iTunes. It will watch for additions, but you will have to import them. Now you have music in your iTunes library, you can sync as usual. As stated above, I had difficulties with freezing, hopefully if you try this method you won't. If it does freeze, I force close and restart the virtual machine, and reboot my iPhone. I was unable to copy music without rebooting my device. As stated above, I had more success using WiFi sync. Half the time I still had the USB cable connected, the other half I didn't. I seemed to work equally well both ways. I was unable to export my music library from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I had to start over with just the files, so I lost all ratings and playlists. This method sadly does not sync playlists between Rhythmbox and iTunes :'(   Syncing with Windows 7 did not sync my album artwork, syncing with Windows 10 did.  Here's everything I tried, maybe something will work for you.   Copying through the terminal via SSH. Failed. Requires jailbreak, requires knowledge about where the music is stored in the iOS filesystem. Also requires knowing how to copy over an SSH connection, which I don't have. Oops. Using Filza File Manager's builtin file server. Open a webpage in chrome, and select the upload file button. Requires jailbreak, requires knowledge about where the music is stored in the iOS filesystem. Promising, except after uploading, each file has to be imported into your music library. This can be done using Filza. It worked, but there was something about it I didn't like that I can't remember right now. I do remember that if you open your device with iTunes, your content will show up as the yellow ""Other"" bar. Using Apple File Conduit ""2"" simply opening your device's filesystem using Nautilus in order to copy from your computer to your iDevice. Promising, except it suffered the same freezes as using Windows in Virtualbox. Also, iOS stores your music seemingly randomly in folders titled F00, F01, F02... and so on. The filenames are also seemingly random. As far as I could tell there was no organization. Just being in these folders doesn't work, your music has to be imported with Filza. Requires Jailbreak. I can open my device with Rhythmbox to view and play the music on the device, but when I tried to copy with Rhythmbox, it didn't do anything. Similarly, whenever the ""Initialize iPod"" window pops up when I connect my device, when I select ""Okay"" it does nothing, and it happens again next time.   I have not tried Google Play Music, but that seems promising, except for the size of my music library. It'd take weeks to upload with a 100KB/s connection :'( Maybe I'll try that when I move here in a month or two."

Ubuntu,3dvyhp,al-pacino,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:58 2015 UTC,UFW is a very nice and user friendly frontend to iptables.  It should be set up to deny all incoming connections per default. Then you can whitelist what's needed arter that.

Ubuntu,3dvyhp,Tzunamii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"Depends mostly on what services you have activated on the Linux system. As an example, if you disable all services there are no remote attack vectors.  Iptables is quite straight-forward and every *nix sysadmin should at least learn the basics to lock any system down once services has been established. I've made my own Iptables-based firewall solution that I apply on standalone Linux systems to maximize their security.  Depending on how critical your services are and where it resides in the network you might want to add things like Tripwire (IDS) and a GRsecurity-patched kernel etc. This is to ensure that your Linux system is locked down as much as possible IF an attacker finds a unpatched attack vector in one of your services and your local firewall implementation was bypassed, for whatever reason.  Also recommended that you use Rootkit Hunter or chkrootkit regularly (cron scheduled) as well.  If we're talking about a Linux desktop system here the largest threat to system security will always be YOU, ie the use of a browser and/or trying out new software are the highest threats to your system. In order to secure that I highly recommend using your browser in a dedicated VM and test out new software etc in another VM."

After than, they will release a bunch of supporting materials,  documents and share their thoughts and opinions about the project. But, I think still Ubuntu Touch is not ready as they believed, I think."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,melmeiro,7,Sat Jul 18 12:03:26 2015 UTC,"Although I really like ubuntu touch and the bq 4.5 is my one and only phone, I think it shows this isn't a finished product and I hope Canonical realises that.  Other people will not be so forgiving as the ubuntu community is..."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,krnekhelesh,10,Sat Jul 18 12:29:18 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, no one at Canonical thinks that Ubuntu Touch is a finished product. It can't be said more clearly that Ubuntu Touch is targeted at developers, enthusiasts, early adopters etc.   Well if other people aren't as forgiving then it is stupid on their part to buy a phone with an OS that's for sale just 4 months ago! Things like this take time."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,AdamColligan,2,Sat Jul 18 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Canonical releases its code as FOSS but vigorously protects its trademark. That might seem silly at first blush, but of course it isn't. The point is that the company has wanted the whole potential user base to understand what they can expect in terms of quality, functionality, and compatibility when they install something called ""Ubuntu"". Now users are ""stupid"" when they buy something with Ubuntu pre-installed and expect it to be finished or expect official documentation on how to do on it the computing that they've done on Ubuntu before? /TL;DR.    Also, while the rest of this comment takes for granted what you said about the target user base, I want to juxtapose two things here. Your quote:   It can't be said more clearly that Ubuntu Touch is targeted at developers, enthusiasts, early adopters etc.    Aaaand this is the front page of the official Ubuntu website right now.    I understand where this comment is coming from, but I think it's a real problem. If the phone is on sale to the public at all, and the OS has a proper version number and isn't prominently labelled ""alpha"" or ""preview"", then some of that ""forgiveness"" might be reserved for the customers who misunderstand what it is.    The target user base includes ""enthusiasts"" and ""early adopters"" -- OP /u/galgalesh is surely one of those, if not a developer as well. Such people are clearly attracted by the fact that this is billed as a ""Linux"" phone, an ""Ubuntu"" phone, and those words have always meant something in terms of capability and compatibility. So consider the perspective of someone like that and what information is available for them. (I'm in this category and would have bought one if not for the third-party reviews saying how unfinished and bare it is).   The OS is on sale, pre-loaded as OEM without on dedicated phones with no Alpha tag. But they're ""stupid"" for thinking that it might be a ""finished product""? They should see who it's being advertised to and assume it's broken or skeletal, when the same audience is the core user base of the very mature Linux desktop ecosystem? You can say that they should have tried it on the desktop first. But, at least for me, every attempt at using an LXC preview on Desktop (on a touch hybrid no less) has loaded something where the basic UI doesn't even work, with every application and menu item broken. I've tried asking about it several times on IRC and never been able to get an answer, and all the general information seems to be about how important device-specific drivers and such are. I even used a public event to ask the Canonical CEO about how much of mobile development continues to depend on fine-tuning per device, and she implied that for now it was a lot. So here are device-specific phones that are out, and I'd somehow be ""stupid"" for taking a leap of faith on them being fully functional? Or for failing to figure out on my own which aspects of the LXC brokenness are about device compatibility and which are about the OS itself being unfinished? Even if the OS still has holes in functionality and/or isn't really polished, the application, permissions, and display manager structures make it difficult or impossible to run so many of the programs or do so many of the tasks that are basic and common to the existing Linux desktop/server ecosystem, right? But the phone is still branded/discussed as a new breed of more ""pure"" or ""true"" Linux devices that finally empower users. The most prominently understood difference with the phone is that it uses Snappy, and the general advertising around the Snappy model is that it applies equally to sever/desktop and is just ""another way to consume the same"" capabilities. In fact, the general line is that Convergence is nearly upon us, just a matter of months. And finally, OP has found the documentation online regarding new/changed aspects to be difficult to discover and digest, and s/he has found a lack of documentation about using the OS on a phone to do old-style, basic, common Linux tasks. So s/he's really being ""stupid"" or ""unforgiving"" for thinking that this Ubuntu Linux device would natively/naturally be able to do generic Ubuntu Linux stuff without a huge fuss?   I fully understand the fact that Canonical has decided to institute a new and different security model for the mobile version. This is the cause of many of the limitations, and there are good reasons for accepting the trade-off right now. But I don't think it is okay to, for example, write off the lack of documentation on how to do standard Linux stuff as a community problem. Canonical is introducing a lot of different structures at once, making it hard for even a very interested enthusiast to keep it all straight. There's a new display stack (Mir), new input focus (Touch), new multi-UI presentation model (Convergence) new package system for security and dependencies (Snappy), new driver sets for specific OEM devices (BQ and Meizu), new user preview model (LXC), new code standard for what's native in some versions (QT), and a whole new permissions environment.  I try to keep track, but at some point what unites them is that Canonical promises that it's all just Ubuntu Linux. When that doesn't mean what even avid and attentive users think it means, there may be a good reason for it. But at the very least, the developers shouldn't be calling the users stupid for having conditioned expectations about something called Ubuntu or for not then writing their own documentation when they find such a sharp deviation from the expectation."

The issue that /u/galgalesh is raising about the lack of documentation with regards to packing console apps and writing a gui around them is something I disagree about actually since documentation in developer.ubuntu.com are made available only for officially supported stuff. Running command-line tools in the background is not officially supported. Period. There are some unofficial ways like using the Open Store where you can set an app to run unconfined in the background.  I did take the time to explain the concept of app confinement, getting help etc to galgalesh here   Canonical is introducing a lot of different structures at once, making it hard for even a very interested enthusiast to keep it all straight.

Which is why I also politely stated here that finding fault at Ubuntu Touch for lack of documentation or the inability to do something that you would like to do is being a little harsh on a platform that is still in its infancy. I am in no way saying that developers and enthusiasts should stop trying to push the boundary. Take charge and lead! But with a huge moving target like Ubuntu Touch, documentation gets outdated really fast coupled with the fact that it requires a lot of manpower to keep them up to date. So the best thing here for galgalesh (being an developer/enthusiast) would be to get involved and come join us on IRC where we can collaborate.  If not then I am afraid he will have to wait for someone else to take the lead because there is a ton of work to be done with limited man power.   But at the very least, the developers shouldn't be calling the users stupid for having conditioned expectations about something called Ubuntu or for not then writing their own documentation when they find such a sharp deviation from the expectation.

So s/he's really being ""stupid"" or ""unforgiving"" for thinking that this Ubuntu Linux device would natively/naturally be able to do generic Ubuntu Linux stuff without a huge fuss?   You are clearly quoting my comment here. FYI I was not targeting my comment at enthusiasts (galgalesh) or developers. I was merely referencing people who are not tech-savy. For instance if a day-to-day person relying heavily on Instagram, Whatsapp, Google+ etc buys a Ubuntu Touch phone then he is going to be disappointed and if he starts complaining about it, have no doubt, I will openly call him/her an idiot. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who is selling it or what his expectations are because he just bought a phone with a OS released just barely few months back and expects it to fulfil all his expectations. Period.   But, at least for me, every attempt at using an LXC preview on Desktop (on a touch hybrid no less) has loaded something where the basic UI doesn't even work, with every application and menu item broken.

Or for failing to figure out on my own which aspects of the LXC brokenness are about device compatibility and which are about the OS itself being unfinished?   Sorry that you weren't able to get help on using the LXC Preview. I am presuming that you're referring to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity8inLXC which explains how to get Unity8 desktop via LXC without affecting your current install. It is clearly labelled a preview. And if you haven't seen it that's unfortunate. There are lot of cool stuff like Snappy Desktop ISO being built that are barely functional and the idea here is to basically test and report bugs and improve its usability one step at a time. It also helps developers address the most pressing issue when they try it out themselves (to get an idea).   If you were expecting the above LXC/Snappy desktop to be fully functional then I would indeed be calling you stupid. If on the other hand, you were referring to the Ubuntu Phone itself, then I must say that for a average individual who uses the phone for tasks like calling, browsing, listening to music etc it is perfectly functional as advertised on Ubuntu.com. For functionalities like running command-line tasks, sudo apt-get update etc, you're free to try, but don't blame us if it breaks. This was not promised on the website FYI."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,AdamColligan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my tone gets a bit exasperated down below. I do appreciate your taking the time to reply in depth above. I think that it might be difficult for people who have a lot of insight and involvement with this project to see from the outside -- or even just outside the inner circle -- the gap between what the advertising implies people should expect and what they are ""supposed"" to expect.  Last thing first -- re: the LXC preview, the point is not that I expected a fully functional desktop version. The point is that it's just one more avenue where people supposedly can figure out what the converged/touch version of the OS is like, what it can do or not do, etc. But at least for me, it doesn't work at all, and I haven't found anyone on various IRC channels who cares.  It was just a minor element in the running theme that I see: that project insiders are too easily assuming that the mismatch between expectation and reality is the result of users of various levels of ability being too lazy to try to understand what the OS is supposed to be. I think it has a lot more to do with the project's own use of misleading branding, overstated rhetoric, and underperforming documentation.   The issue that /u/galgalesh is raising about the lack of documentation with regards to packing console apps and writing a gui around them is something I disagree about actually since documentation in developer.ubuntu.com are made available only for officially supported stuff. Running command-line tools in the background is not officially supported. Period.    My apologies if this is betraying some ignorance, but is this lack of support specific to the phone/touch environment? Or do you mean it's not supported at all in Ubuntu?   [Y]ou can see for yourself the mammoth of a task that Canonical is undertaking. Which is why I also politely stated here that finding fault at Ubuntu Touch for lack of documentation or the inability to do something that you would like to do is being a little harsh on a platform that is still in its infancy.  But with a huge moving target like Ubuntu Touch...   I think this is the crux of the issue, though. I'm going to repurpose the phrase ""moving target"" because I think it applies best to the way that the project is represented or represents itself. It is not branded as a new OS or as an unfinished OS. It is branded as ""Ubuntu"", and it's ""ready"" for phones. Even the version numbers go along with the desktop/server ones. Again that front page screenshot: it's the ""Ubuntu edition"" of a phone. More often, it's just officially referred to as plain ""Ubuntu"". The talk and the hype about convergence has been going on for years now: all about how it's supposed to be the same OS that has such a big following and user base, now unleashed on different form factors that use different input methods. The whole thing is promoted by literally identifying it by name as this mature, well-understood, widely-used OS. And now there's official OEM hardware that ""everyone is invited"" to buy for hundreds of dollars.  Then when users encounter big problems with compatibility, functionality, documentation, or just not meeting expectations suddenly it's their fault for not understanding that this is an entirely different platform that is only ""months old"", ""in its infancy"", ""not finished"", a ""moving target"". It's something with so many fundamental major differences from what everyone knows as ""Ubuntu"" that they shouldn't even expect official documentation to be kept up to date.    This is why I referenced Canonical's branding efforts at the top of my comment above. They clearly think very hard about the value and meaning of the word ""Ubuntu"" and the notion that some version or flavor is official. So when they call something ""Ubuntu"" and it doesn't meet expectations or behave like any other thing called ""Ubuntu"", it seems absurd to blame users for having those expectations. They didn't just come up with preconceptions out of the blue for what Ubuntu should be like: they were told to have them.    Well if other people aren't as forgiving then it is stupid on their part to buy a phone with an OS that's for sale just 4 months ago! Things like this take time.    I [above] was merely referencing people who are not tech-savy. For instance if a day-to-day person relying heavily on Instagram, Whatsapp, Google+ etc buys a Ubuntu Touch phone then he is going to be disappointed and if he starts complaining about it, have no doubt, I will openly call him/her an idiot. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who is selling it or what his expectations are because he just bought a phone with a OS released just barely few months back and expects it to fulfil all his expectations. Period.   On face, this seems like an even worse attitude to have, even aside from the fact that Ubuntu is billed even in this sub as ""for human beings"". Again, you don't even have to go off the main page of Ubuntu.com for your browser tab title to tell you that Ubuntu is ""the leading OS for PC, tablet, phone, and cloud"". So if you knew nothing, you now ""know"" that Ubuntu is one OS and that it's the leader for phone and tablet. She's an ""idiot"" then if she includes herself in the ""all"" who are invited buys a phone with it and expects it to act like a mature OS?   First, how is this by-definition not-tech-savvy person is supposed to know how many months an OS is supposed to be out before she can depend on it?   Second, how is she supposed to know how long the OS has actually been ""out""? Go to the Phone section of the Ubuntu website. The phones are just ""available now"".  At the bottom of every page, there's a ""further reading"" section. It invites you to ""watch the Ubuntu phone video"" (January 2013), read the ""Ubuntu phone press release"" (dated February 2014 and titled ""Ubuntu phones coming to market""), and even to ""Get the FAQ"" about Ubuntu on phones. That's dated Feb 2013 and gives a Q4 2013 or Q1 2014 release timetable (18-21 months ago). Or what if she just found the Ubuntu Touch Wikipedia page? There she would learn that a preview went out in February 2013 (over two years ago), that Ubuntu Touch 1.0 was released on October 17, 2013  (almost two years ago), that a ""relatively stable"" version was out in April 2014 (15 months ago) and that it was ""released to manufacturers"" coming up on a year ago. Even if she had enough vague computing knowledge for it to seem weird that 1.0 was out before a stable version, there is nothing obvious telling her that this platform is somehow an ""infant"" that should have no expectations placed on it.  Thirdly, what about the application or compatibility part? You think she'd be an ""idiot"" if she relies on ""Instagram, Whatsapp, Google+ etc"" and then complains about being disappointed when she can't use them because there aren't native apps? Maybe she's a moron, or maybe she just went to the official Ubuntu phone features page and somehow got the impression that she sould ""enjoy content and services on smartphones, without relying on traditional apps.""  ""Ubuntu’s scopes give you related content on one screen, instead of hiding it behind different apps. So everything you look for in life is now right at your fingertips... Ubuntu’s scopes are like individual home screens for different kinds of content, giving you access to everything from movies and music to local services and social media, without having to go through individual apps.""  And there are a bunch of logos of popular services, plus a promise that there is a scope ""for every facet of life"".   Site: ""Ubuntu Phone has been designed with obsessive attention to detail.""  Here: you're stupid if you think this platform is Ubuntu rather than an entirely new OS, if you expect that all this newness is being done with such attention to detail as to even keep documentation up to date, etc."

From what I understand, the idea is to gradually add platform-services and expand on the app life cycle as requirements are brought forward by developers. This is only for phones and tablets afaik. To be honest, I don't see anywhere on developer.ubuntu.com where they talk about the application lifecycle. That's something that should definitely be added. On the desktop, things will run as expected, so you will be able to run command-line apps and be able to do pretty much everything you can do now on the Ubuntu desktop.   It was just a minor element in the running theme that I see: that project insiders are too easily assuming that the mismatch between expectation and reality is the result of users of various levels of ability being too lazy to try to understand what the OS is supposed to be. I think it has a lot more to do with the project's own use of misleading branding, overstated rhetoric, and underperforming documentation.   And this is where I think you are wrong. When I look at Ubuntu website pages where they show of Ubuntu for Phones, the promises they make like using scopes for surfacing content, edge tutorials, (almost) everything that differentiates Ubuntu Phones from other platforms like Android, iOS are shown. These features are in addition to what any smartphone is expected to provide like making/receiving calls, messages, listening to music, clock app etc. All these features are present in the Ubuntu Phone today. And realistically isn't that what people expect to read about a mobile os? Did Canonical in any place state officially that convergence is available today? I even read their FAQ and it says convergence is something to look forward in the future as a distinguishing feature of Ubuntu Touch.   On weekly basis they host Community Q&A where anyone can come and get their questions answered. Please do provide any official links (wiki, developer.ubuntu.com, ubuntu.com) where they mention that current Ubuntu Phones are convergent or are expected to be equivalent to your desktop where you can run any command-line apps or whatever that you wish to. There is only so much that anyone can predict what others would presume about a OS. Seems like we have hit a situation where people over expect and get disappointed despite official information not mentioning any such info.   First, how is this by-definition not-tech-savvy person is supposed to know how many months an OS is supposed to be out before she can depend on it?    Ubuntu Touch is not targeted at them (YET). Ever wondered why Ubuntu Phone is not available in your traditional retail stores and other places like T-mobile, Vodafone etc..? They are only available as an option on BQ and Meizu websites. This in itself will ensure that not-so-tech-savvy people will come to know about this OS by word of mouth initially.    Second, how is she supposed to know how long the OS has actually been ""out""? Go to the Phone section of the Ubuntu website. The phones are just ""available now"". At the bottom of every page, there's a ""further reading"" section. It invites you to ""watch the Ubuntu phone video"" (January 2013), read the ""Ubuntu phone press release"" (dated February 2014 and titled ""Ubuntu phones coming to market""), and even to ""Get the FAQ"" about Ubuntu on phones. That's dated Feb 2013 and gives a Q4 2013 or Q1 2014 release timetable (18-21 months ago). Or what if she just found the Ubuntu Touch Wikipedia page? There she would learn that a preview went out in February 2013 (over two years ago), that Ubuntu Touch 1.0 was released on October 17, 2013 (almost two years ago), that a ""relatively stable"" version was out in April 2014 (15 months ago) and that it was ""released to manufacturers"" coming up on a year ago. Even if she had enough vague computing knowledge for it to seem weird that 1.0 was out before a stable version, there is nothing obvious telling her that this platform is somehow an ""infant"" that should have no expectations placed on it.   Fair enough this is a good point. But from my answer above, the availability of the devices are made such that not-so-tech-savvy people don't hear about this until the Ubuntu Phone reaches a certain maturity level at which point it spreads with more manufactures and word of mouth.   Thirdly, what about the application or compatibility part? You think she'd be an ""idiot"" if she relies on ""Instagram, Whatsapp, Google+ etc"" and then complains about being disappointed when she can't use them because there aren't native apps? Maybe she's a moron, or maybe she just went to the official Ubuntu phone features page and somehow got the impression that she sould ""enjoy content and services on smartphones, without relying on traditional apps.""   With the current Ubuntu Phones, you can see your facebook, instagram photos in the scopes. There are even webapps for Facebook and Google+. So it is possible for users to access their social media as stated on the website. But you won't find Whatsapp, google hangouts on Ubuntu Phones yet. Realistically I would expect a person who is hearing about Ubuntu for phones for the first time to do some kind of research like read reviews on websites, search on youtube etc before they make a purchase. Because the information that is presented on the Ubuntu website are true, but then again you would need more information to make a decision. Nobody is lying here. But who knows, may be I expect too much of people?  There is one misconception which I will agree with you is that I have seen the spotify logo appear in ubuntu promotional videos which is not available in any way that I know of. That's something that is false and should be changed immediately.   On face, this seems like an even worse attitude to have, even aside from the fact that Ubuntu is billed even in this sub as ""for human beings"". Again, you don't even have to go off the main page of Ubuntu.com for your browser tab title to tell you that Ubuntu is ""the leading OS for PC, tablet, phone, and cloud"". So if you knew nothing, you now ""know"" that Ubuntu is one OS and that it's the leader for phone and tablet. She's an ""idiot"" then if she includes herself in the ""all"" who are invited buys a phone with it and expects it to act like a mature OS?    ha gotch you! So as you say ""ubuntu is for human beings"". Do you expect every non-tech-savvy people to be running comand-line apps and other complicated stuff other than trying to use their smartphone in traditional ways like making/receiving calls, browsing reddit, reading news, listening to music etc? The Ubuntu Phone performs as a phone is expected to perform. Only when you go beyond that and try running your desktop apps on it will you be disappointed for now.   Anyway the point that I tried to convey with my reply to galgalesh and others (that I failed miserably at) is that as a enthusiast/developer who is concerned about the future of Ubuntu Touch, it doesn't help complaining about missing documentation or feature. Get excited and collaborate with us to improve it. Complaining about features just pushes away developers by demotivating them (speaking from personal experience) because they got their hands full already and have a ton of bugs reports to deal with already."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,krnekhelesh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"I believe you have completely misunderstood my question. I do not want to run a commandline program in the background. I do not want it to be unconfined.  What I want is to make a click app that packages youtube-dl and a frontend written in a GUI. This is the first and most basic thing I want to do, and this should be completely possible, but it isn't documented anywhere. Things I'm curious about:   Can a click app make calls to a binary in the same package? Where to put the included binary? How to include the dependencies that are present in ""normal"" ubuntu repo's but not installed by default (so not accessible) on the phone.   The next thing I'd do is make the app actually function. I suspect youtube-dl calls to a bunch of Linux API's that are restricted on the Ubuntu Phone, like the network. Again, this is completely possible, however, documentation lacks some key stuff:    An overview of what API's click restricts  A simple guide about how to use those click API's from other languages (like python)   From my knowledge, the app would now work perfectly as long as the app is in the foreground, and the screen is unlocked. Now I'd try to use the cool features, like the download manager, to work around the app lifecycle problems. Again, no documentation about this. What I'd like to know:   What is the app lifecycle? When is my app put to sleep? How does this happen? Which tools are available to fix app lifecycle problems? I know about a music player and a downloader, are there more? It is possible to wake my app when a download is complete?   Youtube-dl works something like this:   Download webpage Extract link and available file formats Download requested file format Change file format if requested.   1 and 3 can be done by the download manager, but then my app needs to wake up to do step 2 and 4. Is this possible or can these steps only be done when app is on foreground?  I'd file a bug for the documentation if I knew where to file it..."
Ubuntu,3dq3qj,krnekhelesh,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"I am a bit tired after the long replies, so will get straight to the links,  Over of what APIs click apps can access are provided in detail at https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/current/  As for detailed information about app confinement and what it means for your app please read, https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/platform/guides/app-confinement/  There is a old blog post about app lifecycle at https://samohtv.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/application-lifecycle-model-policies/  Hope this helps."

Ubuntu,3dq3qj,Zebster10,12,Sat Jul 18 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think you are being a little harsh on a platform that is still in its infancy. There are a lot of things that Canonical is steadily building up to which include using centralized platform services to perform common tasks such as music playback, download/upload data, one SDK to rule it all, alarm services etc..and these things take time to be properly implemented after careful planning since once an API becomes public, developers are not too happy about it when it gets deprecated. The current userbase is benefiting from these decisions. Daily users like me get to use our BQ phones for more than a day before having to recharge it. Apps are more secure due to confinement. As a developer, uploading apps are easy as a pie (in most cases). etc etc etc...   Yes there are limitations like not being to able to get push-notifications to emails, but those are use-cases that the platform developers are looking into. Android wasn't built in a day. It takes time to do it correctly.  Coming to the app in question, ""VG Downloader"", the fact that it makes a call to a Linux Server than runs a commandline tool is not the fault of Ubuntu Touch as a platform. And let me explain why. Ubuntu Touch provides developers with the Ubuntu Download Manager, a platform service that can run in the background and download data on behalf of the app. The app developer could have used Youtube APIs to get the video url or any other method that youtube-dl uses and send that to Ubuntu Download Manager to download the video.  Also feel free to download python libraries and command-line tools and run them using the OpenStore https://open.uappexplorer.com/ where apps run unconfined without platform limitations. But don't come blaming Ubuntu Developers when battery life is terrible or something else breaks.   What is the Ubuntu Touch developer documentation focused around? Writing apps from scratch. and packaging websites.   And lastly, please stop blaming people who spend a lot of time and effort trying to bring up documentation on developer.ubuntu.com. They are doing a great job and its their choice what they work on. You want better documentation for running command-line tools, feel free to write up the documentation."

The people who write the documentation can only do so when things are done in the official way. And there is no official way to run these command-line tools in the background while being properly confined.   It is a complicated situation that we're in...perhaps it would be best if youtube-dl starts using these platform services making it Ubuntu Touch compatible but that could also break compatibility with other distro which the upstream developers might not appreciate. So this is a scenario which needs planning and brainstorming and could be a potential UOS session actually. While I agree it is important, Canonical also has the responsibility of fixing high-priority bugs for daily-phone users like wifi-hotspot, improving scope experience, convergence etc etc..it is a lot on their plate.   Its just that community members like ourselves should be aware of that and help out if we can."

If people did give at least 1/8th of a shit about Unix/Linux/Freedom fucking anything that involves FOSS, GNU/Linux distros would have at the very LEAST 20% of the global marketshare of ""personal computers"" and Microshoft wouldn't have NEARLY as much dominance as it does right now ( seriously, fucking ~90% still on nearly every desktop PC ).  Sure, MS would no doubt have the majority of the market share ( perhaps at least 50% of the world ), but people who would have given a shit would have taken a stand against MS and not implement their garbage OS across the entire world. People might've taken the ""just werks"" Get-a-Mac Apple PCs, obviously in 2nd place, and the underdog itself, Linux.

Why is it such a big deal that it comes with Ubuntu? I could see the point if a) it was significantly cheaper for lack of a Windows license (the Ubuntu version actually seems to be £10 more) or b) it was targeted at at a broader consumer base.  But the target market - developers - want to use Linux anyway and should be able to take pretty much any laptop and put whatever distro they like on it. I've installed Ubuntu on lots of laptops; the only problem I ever had was glitchy wifi on one; I just spent another £10 on a card I knew to work well and that was that."
Ubuntu,3dmisx,GuzziGuy,6,Fri Jul 17 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"Because the manufacturer is supporting ubuntu on it.  That means they've at least done a bare minimum of testing, and its possible you might even get support on your issues if there are any, and if you're the kind of person who values support.  If manufacturers have to support linux on their laptops, that means they'll have a greater chance of selecting linux compatible hardware in the future, which puts pressure on hardware manufacturers to be compatible with linux too.  Given sufficient momentum, maybe they'd even contribute drivers, who knows?"

Be careful not to install more recent version (such as 340.x or 352.x, which do not support your card). Thankfully, the 304.x version is still available under recent versions of Ubuntu, just be careful about the version.  With the 304.x version installed, your card should be good enough. (Certainly much better than a more recent card under the open-source ""nouveau"" driver.)  Edit: If you still have Ubuntu 15.04 installed, try to see which graphics driver is being used. If it is ""nouveau"", try to switch to the proprietary drivers.  1 GB of RAM might be a little tight (it won't be enough for Kubuntu, for example). 2 GB would be much better for basic tasks (viewing pictures and videos, Internet browsing, mail, office tasks).

Ubuntu,3d9mw0,RadicalizedAtheist,3,Tue Jul 14 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"So here's what I do with Steam on Ubuntu:  By default,  Steam stores your games  under your home directory,  which I don't like because: 1. Your home directory will be huge because thecsteam apps subdirectory will be huge, being mostly static game data and programs 2. Programs shouldn't be installed under your under home directory anyway. 3. Because home is big,  this complicates recovery because you have to back that up to restore it. 4. I clean-install Ubuntu releases when they come out every six months (I don't trust in-place upgrades) so I had to fix another way other than backup >> upgrade  >> restore.   So if you poke around in stream you'll find where you can create additional game folders on other disks.    First,  I installed a spare 1tb disk, formatted it and mounted it to the file system. Then I went into Steam and created a game folder there and set it as default.  Then I quit steam and moved the games from the default location to the new folder.  You have to move the actual game directories under  SteamApps as well as the Metadata files in the folder above that tell steam what hands are there on that disk.   BTW,  You need to back up your entire  /home/username directory  because that's where your save games are.   Now,  here's the magic.  When I reinstall,  I wipe my disk,  install Ubuntu, restore my save game subdirectories under home,  install steam and (inside steam)  ""recreate"" the game folder on the spare disk.  Steam will scan the folder,  see what's there and after rebooting ALL MY GAMES ARE BACK! No downloading,  no reinstalling.   I haven't re-download a game since just after steam added the multiple game folders three years and six upgrades ago.   . Plus,  if you do clean reinstalls when you upgrade the os,  (like I do) it means you have"

Ubuntu,3d9mw0,RadicalizedAtheist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:16:56 2015 UTC,Wine is not an traditional emulator though as it just translates the software component of the Windows API to the Linux kernel whereas emulators translate the hardware.It's D3D to OpenGL translation layer nowadays is very good for gaming as the FPS hit is pretty low(only 10fps and bound to get lower in the future). Wine as a whole could be performing better than Windows if only the code was better optimized but it's still pretty impressive that I'm getting this much good performance seeing as just 3 years ago the FPS hit in using wine was 30-50fps back when CSMT was not invented yet.

It was my fault for screwing around pretty hard with apt-get, and ruining something about Python 3, which I didn't realize everything was depending on. All of the online solutions, like the goggles, did nothing.  So, with 2 hours remaining, I backed up the few things I cared about, mostly by committing and pushing to various git repos. Then I downloaded Ubuntu 15.04 on my PC - I'd been on 14.04 - copied the ISO to a USB, figured out (again) how to boot to it on the laptop, failed to boot the installer, remembered you can't just copy the ISO to the drive, you have to do some magics first, looked those up, did it right this time, set up partitions in the installer (had to look things up again - it's been ages - but ended up reusing the existing ones), reinstalled, apt-get installed git, cloned down my .dotfiles repo, followed all my notes in there to apt-get a couple dozen more programs, git clone repos to various places, and symlink dotfiles back to where they belonged, and got everything set up how I wanted it.  And all of it took 45 minutes. That's with downloading/thumb drive setup.  I had plenty of time to pack up and get to the talk, with an even cleaner, more up-to-date laptop, and every one of my settings - tmux, git, vim (so much Vim config!), i3 (can't stand Unity), mappings for all, codebases in multiple languages, autojump, which had been failing because of some Python crap for a month or so - now working beautifully again.

I dont use a Mac but I assume they can access files over SSH too.

You'll be able to download Chrome basically the exact way you'd install if you were running Windows 7. Right from Google's website. Installation of most other programs is a little different. The best way to download programs in Linux in general is through what's called a PPA, you can then use apt-get.   The second question I don't know about entirely, but the fact that there's an alternative version with the same wifi card means it'll almost definitely work. I'm only hesitant because I've never used this specific device and it's not unheard of that some devices don't have working drivers to boot. I will say that on every device I've installed Ubuntu on, wifi and networking works out of the box, no drivers necessary.  There shouldn't be an issue upgrading between versions of Ubuntu either, not a hardware one at least, nor with drivers. Ubuntu 15.04 just brings newer versions of software. You may experience some issues. I am typing this on Ubuntu 15.04 on my Lenovo T430 though.  I'd say go for it.

The most notable feature is that it has been designed to adapt the desktop interface so that it works on small touchscreen devices like phones and tablets.  This was done in a separate version so that the desktop wasn't affected by the design work.  Over the next year, Unity 8 is being improved so that it will work just like Unity 7 does on a large screen with a mouse and keyboard.  It will also be capable of adjusting the presented interface based on the form factor you're working on.  In short, you can take Ubuntu on a phone or tablet with a mobile interface, and attach a monitor, mouse, or keyboard, and have a full desktop interface.  The Ubuntu system will adapt seamlessly to give you the best experience.  If you have the Ubuntu music player or browser open, it'll have an easy to use mobile interface on a phone but if you plug it into a monitor it'll immediately change to have a standard desktop interface.

Ubuntu,3d4dnd,pythagoreanmetronome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:21 2015 UTC,"I know others have anyway answered but I just wanted to throw my hat in the ring to answer this.  Unity 8 is the desktop environment. Like Gnome, KDE, and previous versions of Unity it's just the main GUI that you interact with on the desktop. In the case of Unity 8 Canonical is pushing toward the convergence of the desktop and mobile. In theory Unity 8 should work on both a desktop as well as on a phone or tablet by simply adapting the interface to the type of input available.  Mir is the display server. Currently Linux uses the X server, which has been around forever. But it's showing its age and people are trying to come up with a good replacement. The Linux community at large has thrown their support behind the Wayland display server. Canonical on the other hand are working towards their convergence and decided that instead of adapting Wayland they had an opportunity to just build their own display server that would help them push the convergence of desktop and mobile again. So Mir handles the display, and the windows in the GUI. It's meant to adapt to, again, whether you are in mobile or on the desktop. Adapting to screen size, and the type of windows you need for the interface.  Obviously not everyone is happy about the direction Canonical is taking. And there has been heavy criticism of Unity and Mir. But in the end Canonical is trying to do something no other distro is even considering at this point, and that's convergence. In the process they are going to make different decisions and they're going to offend a lot of people. I just hope that future is as awesome as Canonical is promising it will be."

Optimizing the calculations on the software end allows the processor to do them faster/easier, which produces a similar result as improving processor clock speeds, there is no bottleneck so to speak because they work together to do the same thing.

Ubuntu,3cy1xc,sharkwouter,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I like to think of it more like this:  Google is out to make money, not please users, unless pleasing the users generators income for them. If some users want something, but it'll cost Google more money than it will make Google, Google won't want to do it. Google also doesn't care about your privacy. They track everything you do so they can give you ads. Companies can either care about the money, or the users. It's like a local-own family shop vs a chain store. I always get better server at family-owned local places, as they care about more their customers than better franchises do. It's a shame to see local family-owned businesses go out of business, but there's always another franchise store.  Mozilla is all about the users. They care about what their users want, they encourage add-ons, their browser is completely open-sourced, and they respect their users privacy. People complain to mozilla that they wanted better dev tools, and didn't want to use chrome. So Mozilla made a Firefox Developer Edition that's better, or at least equally as good as, chrome's developer tools.  This is probably why most linux distros come with firefox, because the distros are open-sources, care about their users, and aren't out to make money like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are. Majority of the software that comes with Ubuntu at least is open-sourced, as not to support companies to make non-open-source software and care about money instead of the users."

They care about helping you keep your information from every company but themselves, I wouldn't exactly call that ""caring about privacy."" They have no problem storing your entire life on gmail, with so much information about you the if you created a gmail account when you were 13 they likely know more about you, then even you know about yourself. So that they can use that information for Google Ads. (I do realize that I can simple delete my account. I probably will once I get an email server of my own.) It's good business to pretend like you care about your user's privacy.  Just because they're better than Facebook, doesn't mean that they're not a for-profit corporation. While Mozilla is at least a non-profit. Which makes the exponentially less likely to sell their users out to make money. That's besides the fact that open-source inherently incentives improvement of the software and it's features regardless of profit. Those features end up being what the users want most of the time, that includes actual (not just for PR or fake) privacy."

Just because you opt out of everything, and you can delete your search history and whatnot, how do you know google doesn't still keep records of it?  As far as I'm aware, they process all of your searches and history as soon as you visit a page, so even if you clear it out later, it's already too late. They got what they needed from you.   And I'm not 100% sure on this, but I've read multiple times that even if you opt-out of google tracking your data, they still track at least some of it. (It was either that, you you can't opt-out of everything completely, or something to this regard.)  Anyways, companies do need to make money. But Mozilla is technically a non-profit organization, where as Google is an all-for-profit corporation.

Ubuntu,3cy1xc,SolarAir,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"I have nothing wrong with a business making money off of fulfilling a social need for society, and to some extent Google does this. But today the world seems to be moving in a philosophical direction where corporations are people, and people are now the products. Personally, I'm opposed to that on principle.   This is why I've been switching to open-source in my life. Firefox is not created (at least for now) in order to monetize it's users, treating them as a product for the advertising companies that they make their money from. Firefox is created and aspires to being the best web-browser to serve it's users. Being the ""best-web browser"" is obviously subjective, but the fact that Google is a for-profit corporation (Again, not always a bad thing, e.g. Tesla or any other lesser known Social Enterprise. Redhat is a Social Enterprise right?) with share-holders to serve and profits to keep up, puts serving it's community secondary to creating the best web-browser for it's users. Google Chrome is a decent web-browser, but it's fundamentally designed to track you, to essentially sell your private life to advertising companies.  At the end of the day, that's your choice to make. I don't think that advertising companies need to know every detail about me in order to serve me better targeted and less annoying advertisements either. They could just put their advertisements on site specifically related to the product they're trying to sell, I'd still see it, it'd be relevant, and I'd still get to have my privacy. I actually think that just giving in and surrendering all my data to Google only enables all the tasteless advertising on the internet more than it helps us. Firefox, with their tracking protection and disabling third-party cookies is what may just help clean the internet up. Firefox isn't prefect, but they're trying."

Your claim (if I understand it correctly) is that Firefox is the odd one out because it doesn't sync to the Google-cloud and (indirectly) claim this means you will be missing out on mobile.  I'm telling you this is false. You don't lose this capability if you go all in Firefox across your devices, just like Chrome requires you to be all in. If you use Firefox on your desktop and phone, it all syncs perfectly well.  If one of the criterias you judge a browser by is add-ons, Firefox wins without even a contest: Firefox mobile supports add-ons (like ad-block) which Chrome totally and intentionally doesn't support. Chances are Chrome will never support this. On Firefox they get synched automatically!  Your point about ""attaching your Google account"" will never work. That's like asking Apple to let you log on to Icloud using Facebook. It wont happen. Firefox can't and never will sync Chrome-data, just like Chrome wont sync Firefox-data. Hopefully the reasons for that is obvious.  It would be nice to have an open and recognized standard for stuff like this, with the ability to run your own servers, which worked across different products, so you wouldn't have to trust others.

(I've since switched distros back to Ubuntu Gnome 14.04.2 after trying a couple of other distros, using Firefox on all of them.) After giving Firefox another chance being a former user before, I decided the speed wasn't noticeably different, and to the extent that I notice it, the customizability makes it well worth using.  Though I don't like how Firefox seems to be becoming with it's new ""best of the web"" mantra... for now I just disable pocket in about:config. And actually like their new Hello feature. (Besides the Telfonica connection.) The Yahoo as a default browser thing doesn't bother me, as they were using Google before and I always just switch to DuckDuckGo anyway, and Yahoo has an agreement to not track searches of Firefox users for the deal with Mozilla. (Not that I trust them, but there at the very least no worse than Google, and I disable them both anyway.)  I also plan to set up Firefox to sync locally for both Hello and Sync... So far as I know you can't do that in Chromium. Overall Firefox or it's derivatives, are way better for privacy/security with the right settings.  I would like to see Firefox become more snappy though. I don't necessarily mind how much resources it'd potentially use in order to fulfil that goal too as I have a Haswell i5 and 32GB of RAM.  Lastly, the main feature I miss is the shift-clicking to select multiple tabs, and the tab-handling extension that I currently have installed doesn't make up for it either."

Ubuntu,3cm9gn,nhaines,8,Thu Jul 9 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"x86 doesn't make any more sense for convergence than ARM, because pretty much everything in the Ubuntu repositories are also compiled for ARM.  There's no such thing as ""Ubuntu Touch"".  The phones simply run Ubuntu with Unity 8.  At the moment, Unity 8 only runs apps made with the Ubuntu SDK, which also run without modification on the desktop.  A lot of work is being done to bring windows management to Unity 8 so that everything else ""just works"", and a lot of work is being done to add desktop-style interfaces to Ubuntu SDK apps so that on the desktop they are pleasant.  (They ""just work"" now, but there's often a lot of dragging involved.)  Right now, only Mir-compatible applications run, but that's simply because XMir hasn't landed yet.  Any Ubuntu app runs on any device.  Ubuntu 15.10 should have a version of Unity 8 which is usable as a desktop interface, although it will be early days and won't be a default until probably 16.10.  The only real trick will be that Ubuntu on phones is a read-only system image, and installing applications will work differently than it does on desktop Ubuntu systems.  Reading between the lines, I wouldn't be surprised if a handful of popular apps (LibreOffice, Firefox, etc.) get packaged for the Ubuntu App Store and that's sort of what you're stuck with.  By the time Unity 8 is default on desktops too, all of that will be sorted out.  In addition, I'll bet by the time a convergent phone is released, someone will have created a script to automatically package arbitrary debian packages for installation.  It's possible on Ubuntu phones right now--basically, there's no work in 15.04 to make it easy, but none to prevent it either.  So it's just a matter of time."

A snappy Ubuntu Personal system will be an alternative to standard Ubuntu now, and I'm not sold on a transition although there are certainly some big pros.  I rather doubt that Debian-based Ubuntu will ever disappear.  Everything's built from debian packages anyway.  Debian packages and click packages were meant to coexist anyway.

Ubuntu is totally open source, there's nothing malicious going on, and Canonical isn't evil. If it works for you and you enjoy it, then keep on enjoying it."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,mhall119,27,Tue Jul 7 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"""Development of Ubuntu is led by Canonical, Ltd. a UK-based ""trading"" company which generates revenue through the sale of ""technical support"" and ""services.""""  This isn't a reason.  ""2. By installing users agree to allow Ubuntu's parent company Canonical to collect user search data and IP addresses and to disclose this information to third parties including Facebook, Twitter, BBC and Amazon.""  Best to read the Ubuntu Privacy Policy to find out exactly what is going on here.  Canonical processes your search terms when you perform a ""global"" search from the Unity dash. Just like how when you search the Internet using Google you send your search terms to Google in order for them to process that to give you results, when you use the Unity dash to do a global search the search terms get sent to Canonical in order for them to process them to give you the results.  If you don't want this to happen, you can either turn this off from the Privacy dialog or use another non-Unity flavour of Ubuntu (Kubuntu for KDE, Ubuntu GNOME, Lubuntu for LXDE, Xubuntu for XFCE or Ubuntu MATE).  ""3. The adwares and spywares introduced in Ubuntu violates user's privacy and is one of the rare occasions in which a free software developer persists in keeping a malicious feature in its version of a program.""  This isn't a reason; it's a claim based on the other claims, which are false.  ""4. Whenever user searches the local files for a string using Ubuntu desktop, Ubuntu sends that string to one of Canonical's servers.""  False. If a user searches using the global search feature, then it searches everything (both local and Internet searches) and gives you all the results. This is clearly labelled (IIRC it says something like ""Search local and online sources"").  However if you limit your search to local files, then there is no need to send your search terms online and it doesn't.  The real objection here is that the user interface defaults to a global search, which includes an Internet search by definition, and the only practical way of doing that is to send search terms to the Internet. I guess some are concerned that hapless users will accidentally search for private stuff without realising that they will be sent online despite the label that tells them that they are searching online. Well, the default is a UI design decision. If you don't like it, you can turn it off. But you can't call it malicious or spyware because both the label and subsequent behaviour tells you exactly what is going on.  If you never want to use the global search function, then you can turn the function off from the Privacy dialog.  ""5. Ubuntu has received widespread objection from the open source community for violating free system distribution guidelines.""  False. It has received widespread objection from a very vocal minority, and to some extent this has been amplified by others who have swallowed the FUD. If you actually look into the details, you will find that nothing malicious or nefarious is going on. The functionality to which this vocal minority objects are well advertised as operational, with no intent to mislead users and can easily be turned off from a single ""Privacy"" settings dialog.  ""6. Canonical disgruntled upstream open source developers by introducing Mir, their own display server not derived from X11 or Wayland.""  Sure, they disgruntled Wayland developers by not using Wayland. But this is because they didn't think that Wayland suited their needs and wanted to deliver results quickly. Whether they are right or not doesn't matter: judge them on their results. Ubuntu are shipping a phone running on Mir today. Open source is full of alternative implementations: see Exim/Postfix/qmail/sendmail, KDE/GNOME/LXDE/XFCE, Debian/Red Hat/Slackware/SUSE, Linux/BSD/Hurd and even x.org/Wayland(/Mir). It's normal for projects with similar goals to go in different directions, and doing so isn't a reason to avoid a particular project.  ""7. Ubuntu's policy prohibits commercial redistribution of exact copies of Ubuntu, denying the baseline freedom.""  Canonical claims the Ubuntu trademark. Free Software philosophy has little to say about trademarks, since they don't affect free software freedoms. You can exercise all the Free Software freedoms to Ubuntu's source code, including commercial redistribution, providing that you remove the trademark. No ""baseline freedom"" is being denied whether by ""baseline freedom"" you mean the Free Software Definition or the Open Source Definition or the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  ""8. Ubuntu is basically Debian with extra ""cool"" look and is not binary compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS which are used for most scientific development.""  A number of full time Canonical employees are also key Debian developers, so it isn't really possible to separate the two in a simple statement like ""Ubuntu is basically Debian"". If you use Debian directly then you also get the benefit of work that is driven by Ubuntu developers. Ubuntu developers are constantly sending patches to Debian (as well as to upstreams, including the Linux kernel). You will also wait much longer to get specific benefits that Ubuntu decided to drive first. For example, faster parallel boot was pioneered in Ubuntu many releases ago; Debian is only just defaulting to it now.  Binary compatibility with RHEL and CentOS for scientific development is a straw man. Do you really need this? If so, then yes, you should consider using Scientific Linux which is Red Hat derived. But for most work, including scientific work, this level of compatibility is simply not required.  Disclosure: I work for Canonical because I like Ubuntu. But I have nothing to do with and am not involved in any of the complaints mentioned here. From that perspective I'm just an outside observer. My opinions are my own and I don't speak for Canonical."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,sgorf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"The real objection here is that the user interface defaults to a global search, which includes an Internet search by definition, and the only practical way of doing that is to send search terms to the Internet.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the latest 15.04, hasn't the defaults been changed, so it only performs a local search by default? Or is it just a rumor I've heard?   Open source is full of alternative implementations: see Exim/Postfix/qmail/sendmail, KDE/GNOME/LXDE/XFCE, Debian/Red Hat/Slackware/SUSE, Linux/BSD/Hurd and even x.org   That works well in some matters, but not so in others. Think about the duplication of efforts that goes into two different apps that do the same thing depending on toolkits. Brasero and K3B basically have the same functionality (of CD writing) for GNOME and KDE respectively. Think about all the development and bug-fixing time that could be saved if both these dev teams work on a single project! Of course, if Wayland is absolutely incompatible for your unity, its a different matter. But you should at least consider the benefits of code and resource sharing.   A number of full time Canonical employees are also key Debian developers, so it isn't really possible to separate the two in a simple statement like ""Ubuntu is basically Debian""   You should make that explicit and speak out loudly. The general perception in FLOSS community is that ubuntu just ""takes"" everything from upstream without contributing anything back - the notable exceptions generally cited are some QT4 components in KDE to which ubuntu devs contribute a lot."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,prahladyeri,3,Tue Jul 7 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the latest 15.04, hasn't the defaults been changed, so it only performs a local search by default? Or is it just a rumor I've heard?   I heard that too, but I'm not sure, so I didn't mention it.   Of course, if Wayland is absolutely incompatible for your unity, its a different matter.   As far as I understand, there are some fundamental technical difference in the mechanisms that Wayland and Mir use to operate. Wayland proponents say that theirs is the right way; Mir proponents say the opposite.   But you should at least consider the benefits of code and resource sharing.   As an example of this, Ubuntu uses libhybris instead of having reinvented the wheel. But now the criticism is that they haven't put resources into libhybris development.  The problem is that when Canonical do something new and drive it (releasing their work under a Free Software license) then the critics say that they are reinventing the wheel and that this is anti-community. Example: Mir. When they use an existing project then the critics complain that they are taking without giving back (even though they submit bug fixes, this apparently isn't enough). Example: libhybris. And when Canonical produce something completely new that hadn't been done before, but then later other projects re-invent (and improve) these wheels, then the critics complain that Canonical do their own thing instead of integrating with the community. Examples: upstart (parallel boot) that came before systemd, and bzr (distributed version control) that came before git. And meanwhile, all of the maintenance work that Canonical does (eg. bugfixes being sent to Debian, upstreams, the Linux kernel, etc) are all ignored by these same critics.  The trouble is that the critics are an amorphous multiplicity of users with no clear single voice, so inconsistencies in their criticisms are easy to forgive and ignore (""I didn't say that"") but the general feeling of FUD remains for those who listen to them."

Or is it just a rumor I've heard?   Online searching still happens in 15.04, but the Amazon scope was turned off by default I believe, and really that's the only one most people were upset about.   Think about all the development and bug-fixing time that could be saved if both these dev teams work on a single project!    That rarely (if ever) actually leads to better projects. There's a reason we have different models of cars, houses, appliances, etc.   The general perception in FLOSS community is that ubuntu just ""takes"" everything from upstream without contributing anything back   That's confirmation bias, the people who believe and repeat that are the  people who want to believe that it is true. Telling people that the things they want to be true are not true doesn't change their minds. Providing proof that those things are not true actually tends to make people become more firmly entrenched in the belief that it is, rather than less."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,mhall119,12,Wed Jul 8 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"The poster in that thread is rather misinformed.  To expound on a few things /u/sgorf said:   Half of these ""reasons"" aren't reasons not to do something.  Yes, there are people in the FLOSS community that view anything that isn't homegrown and out of the community as bad.  Of course, they also shouldn't be using Red Hat products. Reasons 2, 3, and 4 are all the same: Ubuntu does perform internet searches that go through Canonical servers.  This is readily disabled, but there is a problem with it happening by default. Binary compatibility between different Linux distros--or even different versions of the same Linux distro--is a crapshot.  It always has been.  The emphasis has always been on source compatibility, not binary compatibility.  Ubuntu is not Debian.  Ubuntu is not necessarily binary compatible with any version of Debian.  Ubuntu is Debian-derived, though. You can redistribute Ubuntu in any way you like.  Yes, you can sell it unmodified.  That said, before selling it, you must rebrand it.  The artwork isn't free primarily because it is trademarked.  Trademark is a different thing, and while the Debian guys will argue that point until they're blue in the face, they're still wrong.   The Mir/Wayland thing is just some idiots on the Internet having a flamewar.  At this time, it's beginning to look like the Canonical guys have a point again, as they're shipping a Mir-based product while Wayland still isn't quite ready for prime time.    Honestly, the Mir/Wayland thing is fundamentally a reflection of a very old gripe about Ubuntu, and that's the fact that it does de-emphasize the hobbyist developer in favor of a non-technical end user that is unlikely to contribute back.  But that's a philosophical flame war from another time."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,thephotoman,3,Tue Jul 7 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"they're shipping a Mir-based product while Wayland still isn't quite ready for prime time.   The Jolla phone is shipping with Wayland already too, so both display servers are in use on mobile devices already."
Ubuntu,3cfqcz,mhall119,5,Wed Jul 8 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"1. If you don't like corporations, stay away from Linux. Most of its underlying technologies (the kernel, init system, etc.) do not come from volunteers, but rather through corporate sponsored development.   2 - 4. System setting --> Security and Privacy --> Search -->  set ""Include online search results"" to OFF. I believe this feature is opt-in in the latest Ubuntu.  5. The source of any free software package is available with apt-get source. Some people don't like the fact that Canonical puts a trademark on open source binaries (some believe it is a violation of the GPL). The FSF doesn't have an official position on this. Regardless, the source of these binaries are freely available and I believe they can all be deterministically built.  6. You can't be pro-free software and criticize someone for creating free software. Application developers do not need to know anything about Mir. The only ones that need to be concerned are toolkit creators (GtK, Qt, SDL) and graphics driver vendors (Mir has the same driver requirements as Wayland, except for XMir support).  7. Ubuntu gives users free software. The logos and trademarks, however, belong to Canonical. Red Hat and Mozilla do the same thing. Distro's like Linux Mint and Bodhi Linux are based off of Ubuntu and they can (and do) commercialize on that product.  8. Linus Torvalds couldn't even install Debian on his computer. So Ubuntu is certainly not ""basically Debian"" as far as underlying tech goes. As far as underlying technology, the two projects are diverging. Ubuntu is moving towards a different package manager."

The recoll lens PPA solves this, but only for the dash, it doesn't integrate into Nautilus, but I digress.  Even if it would index documents by name (which a lot of other launchers do OOTB) it would be better, but you can only search for documents you've already opened. The same is with browser bookmarks and history. It only shows the ones you've opened in Firefox in an Ubuntu session.

Ubuntu MATE sticks to the GNOME 2 appearance (as per stock Ubuntu back in the day) and stock Ubuntu's tools - although it comes with a tool, MATE Tweak, which allows the user interface layout to be changed to approximate a number of other UIs with a single click. Linux Mint MATE offers a more Windows XP/7-like appearance, substitutes its own tools in some places, and also takes various other entities (such as themes) from Linux Mint Cinnamon.  As another poster notes, LMM uses MATE 1.10 and UM uses MATE 1.8. However, the functional difference between those versions is minor although there are a lot of bug fixes; MATE is not going to gratuitously change large parts of its user interface all of a sudden ...  At present LMM is based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and UM has two current versions - 14.04 LTS and 15.04 - so, if you install the second, you get a newer kernel, more up-to-date versions of some non-MATE packages etc. etc.  I use UM simply because I've never been a fan of Linux Mint's appearance (generally greyish, lots of white space), and also because LMM appears to deliberately minimise the differences between MATE and Cinnamon."

The ""security vs stability"" is only good for enthusiasts who know what they're doing, but don't ever recommend unofficial Ubuntu-based distros to beginners unless they absolutely know what they're doing or they RTFM. I'd recommend Linux Mint to Arch Linux users if anything.

I'm currently running the 4.1.1 kernel with the patched broadcom driver (upstream from Wily) for the 4.x series.  I've been staying on the bleeding edge with both in the hope the network drop and system crashes get corrected, but thus far they haven't.  Ultimately, I put one of the Intel 7265 cards on order and plan to swap it out.  In addition to the problems, I just don't like having to rely on proprietary drivers long term.  I'm averaging around 8 hours of battery life without doing anything intentional to extend it.  I have the 1080p screen and think it's great.  The touchpad is still a little flaky after an hour or so of trying to tune it, but it's way better than most I've used under Linux.  I also seem to have a weird issue where sometimes the keyboard will double enter a key I press and I haven't been able to track that down yet.  Other than that, very solid laptop.

The MST support for daisy chaining is not working perfectly, my right screen (last one in the chain) randomly flickers and turns off for two seconds. No issues on Windows and I've tried everything I could find on the internet. I hope the 4.0 kernel will fix it, it's very annoying.  Unlike most people I had no issues with the touchpad and keyboard not being in PS2 mode, however I use an external keyboard and mouse most of the time. The sound card however is patchy at best and even trips Windows because Ubuntu leaves it in a weird state when rebooting. I could get the speakers to work with a kernel patch, but I have reinstalled since then (to have an encrypted partition). Now, without the patch I only have dummy output in the Sound Settings, but have sound with the headphones plugged in. However, if I don't do a cold boot to Windows, it will BSOD on startup and when I reboot the sound will be missing (it was working perfectly fine without Ubuntu, and works when I do a cold boot).  Overall I am very satisfied with the laptop, I like it very much.  One last annoyance is the smaller, Noble lock. I bought two Kensington style notebook locks (I use it at work), but none of them fit it. If anyone can recommend me a lock, where you don't have to screw it onto the bottom of the laptop, I would be very grateful, thanks!"

Ubuntu,3bn4ao,henny_mac,6,Tue Jun 30 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"The idea you're expressing is not uncommon but Git is not the tool for the job. A filesystem such as btrfs or zfs (on freebsd/illumos/solaris) allows you to take a snapshot of the filesystem only the storage space cost of the files you're changing, making rollbacks relatively easy.  Solaris and some linux distributions have the ability to automatically snapshot and back out of upgrades to the original state. It wouldn't be terribly difficult to snapshot your OS before commands you're worried about.  As always, it's better to thoroughly research and understand the commands and changes your making before executing them. Don't let the safety net let you relax on this point."

Ubuntu,3bn4ao,nvwlsll,4,Tue Jun 30 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"(keep in mind, i'm not very experienced and may not know much)  btrfs is a filesystem that works on 'copy-on-write'. If you copy a file, it is still the same file, so it doesn't create a real copy (but you can still access it as such). only if you change something in that file it will make a real copy.  Advantage of this is taking snapshots is done in an instant and reverting after updates or if something goes wrong also takes very little time. And since it didn't duplicate the entire system for real,  no additional disk space was used up."

Ubuntu,3bn4ao,Bzzt,4,Wed Jul 1 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"You might be interested in NixOS.  Essentially the idea there is that all system packages and their configurations are represented by a single expression in their package configuration language.  To maintain/configure your system, you have a config.nix which specifies what packages you would like to select from the giant nix expression that contains all package descriptions.  Their approach is that creating a system from the same config.nix should produce exactly the same setup, configuration and all.  So you don't create your user account, for instance; you specify your user account in your config.nix and then do a nixos-rebuild.    That giant nix expression which contains all package descriptions, is indeed kept in a git repository.    Something I do on nixos is check out a copy of this nix repo into my home directory.  I can point a software project I'm developing at this saved repo, and all the packages (compilers, libraries) that it uses stay the same as long as I don't change that repo.  This is nice if I'm working on a specific feature and I don't want libraries to get updated and break other stuff that I'm not working on.    Meanwhile my system as a whole uses an update channel to keep its repo up to date, and on the latest packages.  You can have different versions of software installed simultaneously, so my software project and my system as a whole can have different compiler versions and etc.    Each time you upgrade the system, a sort of checkpoint is generated; you can revert to that when you'd like.    All that said, nixos is not really for noobs, and its a small community so not all the ubuntu software catalog will be available.  If you use nixos, expect to spend some time reading and on IRC and so forth figuring things out."
Ubuntu,3bn4ao,Bzzt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"Reading up on Nix/Guix and NixOS is like an eye opener. It now seems absurd that your home computer would have a single run-time environment.

Now I just have nixos on there.  I haven't tried nix on another linux so I can't really report about that.  I have another laptop with windows/ubuntu so I just use that for certain things, like kicad.    I was all into learning nix and nixos at first but I have sort of stalled out and gotten busy with projects.  I've got a bare bones xmonad install and it works, but there are various problems that I'm too lazy to solve right now, such as getting printing to work, samba, various other things.  Documentation is not necessarily up to date and I've had some frustration from time to time about that.  It might be smoother to run a more mainstream desktop environment.

The fact that this was a forced and drastic change to the default UI made me reconsider my trust in Canonical.

Furthermore the change to Unity was heavily ""advertised"" and should not have been unexpected.  Furthermore Unity was first part of a non-LTS release which is even more of a reason to expect such changes.   I don't buy your story.  The attitude (hate? entitlement?) shown by someone who would choose to swap distros instead of issuing one command to change from using the default DE to their specific choice of DE is hard to imagine.  If you had bothered to explicitly choose a DE then you would only get key rebindings when that DE upstream rebinds keys (which would occur with any distro [e.g. with GNOME 3 every distro had rebindings])."

So as you mentioned you can install teamviewer on the desktop and always remote in. In this scenario your desktop is acting as a teamviewer server.

Ubuntu,3bb4it,emk2203,34,Sat Jun 27 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"Fellow software developer here, please for the love of god do not install a 32-bit OS unless you are extremely memory constrained (like, you have 512MB of RAM or less).  x86_64 has a tremendous amount of advantages over the vanilla x86 architecture, the one that most people think about is breaking the '4GB' wall but the Linux kernel has supported PAE (physical address extensions) for over a decade now — allowing more than 4GB of physical memory on even 32-bit systems.  x86_64 has double the general purpose CPU registers in comparison to x86, it also guarantees SSE/SSE2/SSE3 are present so compilers can do some additional vector optimization that it cannot safely do without explicit flags on x86. The increased address space allows for increased safety, since PIC (position independent code) can be randomly placed in a 64-bit address space, which means it's a whole lot safer than 32-bit ASLR — the increased address space means that individual applications can have more than 4GB of data mapped into their process as well, this is beneficial for things that use mmap() in particular even if you have 4GB or less of system memory.  The JDK, Eclipse, all of JetBrain's tools are natively supported on 64-bit systems, and will run as 64-bit applications will all the advantages that come with that.  Any 32-bit applications will work as normal, Ubuntu has moved to using multi-arch to handle legacy 32-bit applications, with 32-bit .so's stored in /usr/lib64, /lib64, etc, so they run as they would on a native 32-bit OS. You can install the 32-bit version of a package by appending :i386 to the package name in your apt-get command, for example apt-get install libgtk3:i386.  GCC in general supports cross-complitation, allowing you to build an object for a completely different architecture than what you are running on your system, thus the x86_64 version of gcc can easily build for 32-bit x86 or ARM or MIPS or PowerPC or whatever else there is a GCC target for.  Please let me know if you have any more questions, I'm happy to answer."

Sorry, not sure about that one. I'm not much of a GO player. I do know that Valve found that some of their other games ran better on Linux than on Windows though. Pretty much all drivers install automatically, unless you've got some uncommon hardware like a USB mobile broadband modem or something. You might have trouble with the wifi. I think the preferred brands are Intel and Atheros. Copy anything you want off the computer, and then just install Windows over the top of Ubuntu. Dual booting with Ubuntu already installed is a lot more complicated. Firefox comes pre-installed, but Chrome works perfectly. You have to download it from Google's site though, it's not in the standard repos. Normal software updates are checked for automatically, and you get a popup asking if you want to install them. You can also check and update via the terminal. I don't know about BIOS/UEFI updates.   Ubuntu would be a good fit for you. Stable, recommended for Steam, easy to use. I'd recommend going with 14.04.  You could also try one of the other flavours if you want. Ubuntu MATE seems to be recommended quite a bit. Just google some screenshots of Ubuntu, GNOME 3 (Ubuntu GNOME), Ubuntu MATE, and Plasma 5 (Kubuntu), and see what you like the look of.

Otherwise the Windows bootloader overwrites the Linux one and is too stupid to know that Linux is an option.  And I'm not sure about Windows 8 and later, UEFI really messed up dual-booting for me. I've got an SSD per OS, and I have to unplug Windows completely if I want to boot into anything else.

At least, for external devices. This is especially true of USB dongles....which can overheat anyway when attached to a laptop.  Reality is the Linux networking stack is actually pretty good these days. Far better than it used to be.   For internal wifi, anything that doesn't explicitly say Atheros or Intel should be avoided. Not because it's impossible to get working, rather because it's designed by Broadcom and despite their ""membership with the open source community, their track record for compatibility is horrid.  For existing laptops, let this be your guide.  https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Intel  If you're not comfortable changing out the wifi card yourself, hire a local tech to do it.

I don't know how big a deal it would be, but I imagine someone with a broad set of different hardware could, with patience, set up a framework for algorithmic troubleshooting of wifi and updating a global database with results.  So it would be basically ... you start out checking the wifi-config-db for your exact system. If it finds a match, it sets up what it knows works. No match, it goes through a flowchart to make a best-guess of what drivers & configs will work best, and from there just tries by brute-force to get one that works properly. When it does, it pings the wifi-config-db with the working formula. Next person with same config, just pulls it and skips the troubleshooting.

But, configuring one of the non-standard DEs from scratch is a non-zero amount of effort, which I wouldn't want to put a newbie through (and I wouldn't recommend Unity to a newbie). This is the most practical way of maintaining all the options as preconfigured installs: separate teams which focus on the DE they care about and work on separate standalone install DVDs."
Ubuntu,3b70da,confluence,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:40:35 2015 UTC,Couldn't and wouldn't this only have to be done once though?  After they figure it out once it should be easy to swap configs and distros shouldn't it?
Ubuntu,3b70da,that1communist,3,Fri Jun 26 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"No, because things change, and when things change they break other things. That's why they call it ""maintenance""."
Ubuntu,3b70da,confluence,-1,Fri Jun 26 22:09:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, but the way I see it each setup would be in an isolated environment on the disk, would it not?  swap out the changes on the disk, make sure it all works once, and then its all good.  You just have to make maintenance easier."

Ubuntu,3b70da,jdblaich,4,Sun Jun 28 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"I find this comment rude and unnecessarily blunt. I haven't downvoted anyone. I don't believe that installing KDE is particularly difficult, but it would be incredibly more difficult without the work of the individual -buntu projects. It is their effort that has created the integration that it has. Installing the relevant desktop also does not configure your system in the same way that the individual projects do.

The minute the response is ""Well that depends on what desktop you're using"" then you're adding a bunch of complication, which most people don't want.   One of the reasons Ubuntu got popular is it basically said ""We're going to take the best of OSS, wrap it up together in one package, pick opinionated defaults, but let people know what they want."" There are plenty of distros that let you choose those things.   That meant one desktop, one office suite, one browser, one text editor, etc. The people who care about what window managers and desktop environments are know what they are doing and know how to get those things."

If one single DE should be picked from all available alternatives on a wide set of parameters to pick the best option to collectively promote desktop Linux usage (something almost nobody of importance actually wants, but that is another discussion), KDE is the best choice.

A good chunk of KDE developers are employed by Blue Systems (who would presumably be saving a bit of cash if Kubuntu went away, because they are also the main backer of Kubuntu).  On top of that, there is Netrunner, also a product of Blue Systems, and which (IMO) would be the logical and easy choice for Kubuntu refugees since the non-rolling version is based on Ubuntu anyhow.    Personally I prefer Netrunner over Kubuntu in any case.  But even without Netrunner, no Kubuntu should definitely NOT spell the end of KDE.  And, I disagree with your premise that choice is bad.

Some bad design made it into the language over the years, and the Python core devs wanted to fix all the old cruft once and for all. To do this, they needed to break backwards compatibility. Rather than gradually changing stuff over the years and slowly breaking compatibility, they did it all in a single release.  The differences seriously aren't that big. It's very possible to write code that works in both Python 2 and Python 3, but there's a lot of code to which this does not apply.  As a result, Python 3 didn't have a lot of libraries that supported it when it was first released. Many libraries have since been updated to support Python 3, but there are several (important) libraries which simply ignore Python 3 and refuse to support it.  Because Python 3 has fewer libraries and Python 2 has all libraries, everybody simply sticks to Python 2. It also doesn't help that Python 2 is still standard on almost all *nix installations."

If you're willing for something less complicate and more manageable I suggest you to look into Firewalld. Firewalld on the opposite of IPtables is modular so you can adjust it with simpler commands. Let's make an example: if you want to enable http on your server you need to specify the rule related to port 80 with iptables.

However I recently got him a google Chromebook, and he absolutely loves it. It requires almost no maintenance from me, very occasionally I use chrome remote to check things, or resolve website issues. It has easily been one of the best presents I have given him.  I note that you asked for a desktop, rather than a laptop, and the LG Chromebase comes in at £215 in white, including monitor/mouse/keyboard. (Only £207 if you prefer black). With a compatible external hard drive, it will easily come in on budget. clicky  I would never try to dissuade anyone from trying Ubuntu, but for my father, who does almost all his computing in a browser, chrome OS is perfect.

I'm also a little confused because i have switchable graphics, one that does the job for gaming (amd radeon m275) and the other one is intel.  Before in windows i would right click on desktop and select switchable graphics which would open something to do with AMD. Then i would select the game and put it to high performance so it runs AMD instead of Intel.  By any chance do you know if i need to get drivers for those cards or additional software for the switchable graphics thing?  In windows the switchable graphics with AMD was always there, but i did have to update those drivers."

Ubuntu,3av4cl,dadarobot,3,Tue Jun 23 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think marksei means under Linux.  Graphics cards under Linux is a topic unto its own. I can explain that situation briefly.  AMD, Intel and Nvidia all focus on their Windows-based graphics drivers as a first priority, which is arguably pretty reasonable, what with most of their customers using Windows.  Then developers from AMD/Intel/Nvidia, along with members of the Linux open source community, produce a couple of drivers that run on Linux to support the graphics cards.   There are usually totally-open-source drivers, which the manufacturers and the community collaborate on, and proprietary ones, for which source code is not made available to the public, and over which the manufacturer takes exclusive control. Sometimes the open-source one is better, but often to get the most performance, you have to install the proprietary one. It's different for every card.  The most-recent cards, especially the high-end ones, have gotten more rapid support under Linux. Arguably that is because Valve started a sizable effort to make Linux their vision for the future of gaming, and have encouraged develops to make/re-code lots of games for Linux. And SteamOS/Steam Machines is a kind of Linux.  I heard that for a while, support wasn't very good under Linux for hybrid graphics setups. Support has probably improved at this point, but I don't happen to know for sure. ""Your Mileage May Vary."""
Ubuntu,3av4cl,galudwig,2,Wed Jun 24 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah i heard valve once say that their games run better on linux than windows.  I've just tried out a couple games, one works but doesn't use the right graphics card which makes it lose significant fps. The amd radeon on is supposed the be the one for gaming, but it wont recognize it. In windows i could use the catalyst control centre thing and set the game to high performance and then the game would recognize it.  Right now, i can't get that to work. I can try to do the additional drivers thing, but what if my laptop bricks? Would i even be able to fix my laptop if that happened?"
Ubuntu,3av4cl,galudwig,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:28:12 2015 UTC,"First: It's a lot easier to reinstall a free Linux distro than Windows. So, yay open source software!  When your graphics software doesn't work, and you don't get the graphical interface, yeah that can make it pretty hard to use the operating system. If that happens, I would remove the driver package via command line, or just reinstall Ubuntu. I've had to reinstall while getting my graphics drivers sorted. It's a bit annoying, but nothing worse than annoying. So in all honesty I think the stakes are pretty low.  Most graphics cards aren't capable of physically damaging themselves, other than by remaining way too hot for a long time (days on end). In any case, the most-likely error is that you won't get hardware acceleration (3D stuff) but you'll still get a 2D or CPU-based 3D desktop. The next-most likely error is having no graphical interface (but still booting to the command line, which is considered very powerful in Linux) and then having to fix it from the command-line or else reinstall the OS.  Edit: So, worst case, you have to re-install a fresh copy of Ubuntu."

Ubuntu,3av4cl,KratsYnot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks.   I did see the additional drivers thing. For some reason it is listing a graphics card i don't have (AMD HD 8800m). mine is (AMD Radeon R9 M275) which in windows, i think would only be activated when i played a game. But beforehand i would have to use the the catalyst control thing (i'm not too sure what it's called) to set the game i was playing to 'High Performance'. If i did not do that, the games would think think i was using Intel graphics. However when i do do it, it recognizes the graphics card.  I am quite concerned, because after doing some googling about this, i find some people making threads on all sorts of forums about this, some threads left unanswered for months, some people resolving the issue, then some people trying to resolve their issue the same way and ending up bricking their pc or laptop.  I'm pretty scared about that, because i really, really can't afford to brick my laptop. I'm not a tech savvy person, though i'm on a mission to become one lol. But yeah, I'm terrified of doing something wrong and destroying my laptop.  I will try out a game first since that seems like the most responsible thing to do first.  It sucks though since i have some family staying at my house this week, everyone is watching netflix and it will take over 4 hours to download a small game.  I'll do that first, but if it doesn't work out, where would be the best place for me to post a question about it?  I see here in the sidebar it says you shouldn't ask tech support questions here, so I'm already overstepping my boundaries a little. It says i should go to askubuntu. But from googling, i see a lot of threads about this issue that haven't been responded to.  Is that the best place i should go to for support? Or do you know if there is anywhere else where i might get more responses?"
Ubuntu,3av4cl,Alchemy333,2,Tue Jun 23 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"AskUbuntu is a good place for support. /r/linuxquestions and /r/linux4noobs are also good places to ask questions. Just be sure to describe your problem well and post logs if possible :)  As for your fears of bricking your laptop, all I can say is that would be extremely unlikely. I suppose it is possible, but I've personally never heard of anyone having broken hardware by updating a driver and if you stick to the menu in the Additional Drivers application, I'd be extremely surprised if something were to happen to your laptop (do NOT download and install drivers you find on the internet unless you know exactly what you're doing though!).   But the proprietary drivers (catalyst) are definitely not the answer to every problem and it's very well possible that they won't work. In that case you might find yourself booting to a black screen. If that happens, don't panic, you can use a login console (press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to go to one and press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to go back to your graphical display to see what I mean) to roll back your update. This can be a pretty confusing and time consuming thing to do if you're new to linux (you'll get the hang of doing things like this over time though) so you might be better off just making a backup of whatever you've put on your fresh install so far and reinstall ubuntu instead if push comes to shove.  Finally, the name of the driver update not matching up with your exact model name might be because it is actually for a whole line of different cards, including yours. The naming of AMD cards confuses the hell out of me too so I'm not too sure."

I spent my time on Ubuntu, as well as on elementary OS and others. While I was really happy with my choice, I recently came to the conclusion that for me it doesn't really matter. If everything I need is on every platform, what OS I use doesn't matter at all. Windows, Mac OS, Linux... they are all great. I had my fair share of problems on Windows, but also on Ubuntu with drivers, updates and stuff. I like tinkering, so for me it's not a big deal. For me there is no ""better OS"" and ""worse OS"".   I only wish more people would know how great Linux and Ubuntu can be. I didn't know for a long time and using them really opened my eyes.   Anyway, what I tried to say in my weird post is that you never know what will you need or with what you'll end up with. It's really something fascinating."

Since I'm a gamer I kept my Win7 but I noticed that I started playing games that run on Linux (e.g. X3, KSP,...) or Wine (e.g. WoT) and only use Windows for games that I didn't get to run on Linux. Everytime when I use Windows I get remembered why I would never go back: Oh, a new wireless mouse, lets install drivers the next 5 min. Oh, a graphics tablet, lets install drivers the next 5 min.

But there are also things like that I have to check which Windows updates I can run without risk. For Example KB3033929 would run my system into a boot loop.

I installed everything, had to reboot several times during the update process and still didn't get that button. I looked it up on the official windows support website and some employee had made a script that checked if the OS was compatible. I ran the script and it figured out my installation was compatible so now I have opted in.  But why was it so hard? Why couldn't I just upgrade and install all of the patches in one go?

And the apps are scalable to work on mobile or the desktop.  It's taken a while, and Microsoft breathing down their necks with their own convergence, I think it's still exciting. Ubuntu Touch is the only mobile OS that could really get me to move off Android. And it should be noted that while the Windows 10 convergence is kind of gimmicky looking at present, the Ubuntu Touch convergence actually looks like the future to me. It's not just throwing an image up to a TV so you can use MS Office (the only big point Microsoft has touted so far), it's your mobile computer. It's your desktop with a full terminal. It's your, yes, word processor. It's your development environment with your IDE.   I'm excited for the future! And I think that Canonical is getting it right.

People on iPhones and Androids will install the app if others are using it. But the point is that the default on all these OSes should be encrypted. iPhone is the best because of iMessage and Facetime. But due to their proprietary nature are not ideal. Still iPhone is a better choice than Android IMHO because of this.  Ubuntu should be defaulting (like iPhone) to encrypted communications. Among the options available in the free software realm, none is better than Signal when evaluating criteria.

Ubuntu,3aud3s,HatePlusPlus,0,Wed Jun 24 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's more about the philosophy behind it than any particular app. Any core app with one-touch encryption would be acceptable regardless of which product is used. You're right that ease of use will ultimately be the deciding factor in user acceptance. If the default SMS app had a little lock icon that could be pressed to enable encryption and force the app to use MMS or some other service, that could solve such a thing. Admittedly, there are significant constraints involved."

If Canonical is going to invest time and money into a default messaging app, we should encourage them to develop core apps that reflect the community's collective philosophy on openness, freedom, security, and privacy. Having a phone as equally intrusive as Android with fewer apps is not a selling point. If /u/gthwes is the greatest security programmer in the world, then, yes, by all means be smug with him for being lazy. Chances are he's just an average ubuntu user who wants to encourage development in the right direction."

Every core app has been community-developed.  Telegram doesn't do cleartext--it's all encrypted, with end-to-end encryption as an additional option.  Right now, it sounds like he's complaining that Ubuntu phones support text messages."
Ubuntu,3aud3s,chinnybob,3,Wed Jun 24 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"Telegram doesn't do cleartext--it's all encrypted, with end-to-end encryption as an additional option.   tl;dr: if you read the Schneier article I linked, you would see how this statement is a problem. The comms need to be secure to help people who need it. Even having a setup that is not end-to-end is contributing to the problem Schneier speaks to.  PS: End-to-end encryption is the only setup that is secure. End-to-end should be the default. Telegram's two different setups create confusion and complicates things unnecessarily. Apple doesn't have two setups, it has one--secure (ie, end-to-end).   Telegram should only have one setup (ie, end-to-end). Further, because it rolled its own crypto, there can be no confidence in its design. Security comes from maturity and proven ""design"" over years of being tested and banged on. It will be a decade or more before we know whether Telegram is ""secure.""  For a look at Telegram vs Telegram Secure Chats, see the EFF Scorecard"

If it is important to you, get involved.  It's easy to do so and the developers are very friendly.  But if the problem's not important enough for anyone to work on, it's not going to get done."

Using Ubuntu requires a bit of a different way of thinking than in Windows. I will add however, that Ubuntu hits a sweet spot for people who either don't know much about computing or know a lot about computing. That leaves average or power users at a bit of a loss at times.  Typically you want to stick with the software center as much as possible. These are packages designed to work with Ubuntu specifically, especially the particular version of Ubuntu you are using.  If you want to venture outside of the software center, make sure you look for software channel subscriptions for your particular version of Ubuntu. These are sometimes referred to as PPA channels.  I believe Dropbox is available as part of the software center so you should be fine there.  Virtualbox is also in the software center. I will add, however, that from having the same laptop I can tell you that there is a bug in the version of Virtualbox found in the software center for the processor found in the XPS 13. You will have to install it from the Virtualbox site.  Virtualbox does not have a PPA but is available as a deb channel. This is almost the same thing but requires a little more work to install. It will provide newer versions of Virtualbox through Ubuntu's update utility.  The more you stray from the software channel, PPAs, and deb channels, the more you end up in an ""unexplored"" territory.  Can you make things work? Sure, but they may break first or take some figuring out, as you've run into.  I encourage people to use what is right for them. If you want to have full power over an open system where that power may require advanced knowledge you may not have yet, Ubuntu/Linux can be fun and rewarding.  If you want something that ""just works"" for your current technical abilities, Windows or Mac OS X might be better alternatives.  Either way, I'm sure you'll find communities of people, such as /r/Ubuntu (here) who might want to help you."

In windows, just click and next next next...then you're done.   However, I did begin to appreciate the linux way. I type a line in terminal and then I'm pretty much done; it's faster and I prefer apt-get (terminal) now. Synaptic or software center are okay.

The fact that experiences like yours still happen is a problem. There should be a clear pop-up warning when one is at risk of removing their desktop environment. Ubuntu is definitely not ""idiot-proof"" (not that I'm calling you an idiot, it's just the expression)   Plus the constant password prompts are starting to get really frustrating   This is for safety's sake.

(stock android?) download the Ubuntu touch zip for the specific device  load into recovery mode and install the zip as an extra rom  choose Ubuntu touch from your boot menu    XDA forums are a great source for how to do everything   good luck. and never be worried about bricking your device.

Sometime when you try to compile the latest of some software the developer has made the most recent graphical system a dependency.  You then can't update that one without risking breaking other software if you just compile it over the current one, or you try to find a repo for it and you find that because of it's dependencies if you install it half your system is going to be in conflict with much of the rest of it."

C++/QML has quite a higher learning curve than Java, and as I have not yet developed for Ubuntu Phone, I don't know if the convergence comes automatic, or if a developer is still responsible to create multiple layouts (eg like in a responsive website).  Still, adding Android apps would make things worse before they get better, Google Services are not always able to work, which retailers are distributing these apps is also a murky zone.  Not even mentioning the confusion that would arise for certain UX paradigms that exist on one platform, and not or differently on another.

Ubuntu,3a4zju,DarwinKamikaze,2,Wed Jun 17 13:03:16 2015 UTC,The 'Ubuntu Phone Insiders' got the device for free from Canonical. They're planning to sell it in Europe starting next week… but that might change or delay for another week.
Ubuntu,3a4zju,DarwinKamikaze,2,Wed Jun 17 13:10:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I hope they will ship to Australia!
Ubuntu,3a4zju,DarwinKamikaze,2,Wed Jun 17 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"They won't, sorry :-/. The US are also waiting for their first device…"
Ubuntu,3a4zju,leogaggl,2,Wed Jun 17 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm well I know someone in London, maybe they'll ship there...!?"
Ubuntu,3a4zju,flopgd,4,Wed Jun 17 13:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're shipping to Europe, which includes London ;)"
Ubuntu,3a4zju,leogaggl,6,Wed Jun 17 13:38:46 2015 UTC,For the moment at least ...

Ubuntu,3a4l5y,jimmyradola,2,Wed Jun 17 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"I don't get this company. They aspire to be selling pre-installed computer systems and provide proper, proprietary-level user support on both XFCe and GNOME, yet they can't even be bothered with a proper website (theirs is Blogger.com blog)."
Ubuntu,3a4l5y,bmarkovic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think the site is ok-ish. The only really weird things are the social media icons (different sizes and a wooden facebook one(why?)) and the paypal button (which looks stupid on every possible site design you can come up with).   And the tips and tricks page where users are supposed to post those as comments (1 so far).   Ok, you are right, it is pretty strange. At least they are consistent: their number one sponsor (black lab software) has the same design: http://www.pc-opensystems.com/"

Ubuntu,3a3emj,Rebootkid,3,Tue Jun 16 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"If you go to the PPA's url and click on the filter list it does not seem to support Utopic. I think this may be because it has not been updated in 65 weeks, so it may not be maintained anymore."
Ubuntu,3a3emj,lev_k,2,Wed Jun 17 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"That's the confusing part, because I only installed it a week or so ago..."
Ubuntu,3a3emj,tgm4883,2,Wed Jun 17 02:12:49 2015 UTC,That's not confusing. The app that adds the ppa doesn't check that it supports a specific release before adding it. It just takes the ppa and adds your release name to the line
Ubuntu,3a3emj,k2trf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"No, it kinda is. I've not done a dist upgrade. I'm still on 14.10. Same as when I installed it via the PPA.   Oh... Although, I think the coffee is kicking in. There was a second PPA for extra screenlets. I'll bet that's the misbehaving one."
Ubuntu,3a3emj,_MagnoliaFan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"That's interesting considering there is an Utopic branch...  Either way it shouldn't be an issue (that can't be worked around); I've many times before gone into /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ and manually edited the ppa, just backdating the package to be (in this case) trusty in place of utopic."
