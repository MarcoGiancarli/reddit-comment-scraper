Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,TheSelfButcher,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:39 2015 UTC,Our lawyer friend here is getting better at protecting himself haha
Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,civic_sdz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"You know me, I still haven't found the perfect menthol soap because they're all very one-dimensional (i.e. minty and not much else). I like depth and complexity.  Would you say Arctique is more complex than the others? I'm not looking for Lavanille or Hallows depth (but can hope)?  Did it come out softer than your other offerings due to the mega-menthol?"
Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,NeedsMoreMenthol,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"I would say that it's more complex than some because the fragrance is a combination of peppermint and black pepper rather than just menthol or just mint. The black pepper base we use is very floral and clean, which gives it a softer, richer scent.  While the vegan base did not handle menthol well, the tallow seems to have survived the addition much better. The soap is just as solid as the rest of the White Label line. :)"
Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,schickter,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:44 2015 UTC,I had the vegan Arctique.  It definitely had a different consistency.  Do you feel the tallow Arctique is noticeably colder than the original vegan version?  Is the scent noticeably different?
Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,schickter,4,Tue Jul 21 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"It has half again as much menthol, so yes, definitely colder. Otherwise, no, I wouldn't say that the scent is any different than it was. :)"
Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,chevro1et,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:02 2015 UTC,Thanks Will.  You make a great soap.

Shave_Bazaar,3e31xn,ISISFieldAgent,2,Wed Jul 22 01:21:14 2015 UTC,My pleasure! Thanks for the order! I can definitely attest to the fact that it's colder than Vostok. The original Arctique was considerably colder and this round is colder still. :)

Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,stirlingsoap,3,Thu Jul 16 15:07:40 2015 UTC,Good stuff! The continuing democratization of synth brushes is an awesome thing to see.
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,crazindndude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:19 2015 UTC,It's be nice if it drives down the prices of premium natural brushes.
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,justateburrito,0,Mon Jul 20 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"If anything I see them staying the same or higher as they move more firmly into the luxury tier. These prices really threaten boars though, since they're the budget first choice for many."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,crazindndude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:11 2015 UTC,"I like the new synthetics, but I still prefer natural badger and boar for daily use."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,justateburrito,3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:24 2015 UTC,Are these the Plisson style knots? I think they look great in your basic black handle. Really glad these knots have made it possible to get a really nice quality brush at an affordable price.
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,almightywhacko,3,Thu Jul 16 17:06:03 2015 UTC,Yep.  Just bigger.
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,drivenlegend,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"They definitely look to be. Now I actually have a decision to make, I've been eyeballing the Fine Synth for a little while even though I don't need one. But I kinda like the black handle better. I'm curious how the weight is on the Stirling one. If its heavier/more substantial feeling I might have to go that direction."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,nomemehere,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Also the fine synthetic is only a 20mm. It's a nice brush, but for me it was a little too small."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,drivenlegend,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:31:39 2015 UTC,That's a good point! I think that might have made the decision for me.
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,thefrencharmy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:40 2015 UTC,How's the backbone compared to a L'Occitane plisson?
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,chill31613,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"It's a higher loft, so it's a bit less stiff, but I would have to let others who are more familiar with the Plisson make the final judgment. I only had one for a short while.  I tested it out, loved it, found a company who could make something very similar, and passed it on to a friend."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,airtightalright,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"Eyeballing the picture, is it safe to say the loft is actually something like 52mm and set 10-11mm?  The site says 63mm loft - which I would expect to look much taller."
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,btreecat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:02:12 2015 UTC,Nope. It's 63. The handles are big. :-)
Shave_Bazaar,3difsb,btreecat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:08 2015 UTC,Well I should have waited for this! I love the Island Man soap and aftershave BTW. Wonderful scent and lather.
Shave_Bazaar,3djd86,MrTooNiceGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"Damn, I love that handle. Great looking brush, I wish I could pull the trigger but I am a bit overextended right now. Good luck with it dude!"
Shave_Bazaar,3djd86,Gaidin23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's got an awesome handle, but just not enough of everything else that I like /="
Shave_Bazaar,3djd86,BabyEatin_Dingo,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"medium backbone and a bit of scritch sounds just about perfect to me, too bad I can't even imagine spending that much on a brush. . . good luck with the sale, I'm sure you'll find a good home for it."
Shave_Bazaar,3djd86,Deckma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"I had similar thoughts about this time last year. Fast forward to two months ago when I bought that Ebony CH3 in Manchurian... Let's just say, you can justify a lot of things if you're willing to save for them."
Shave_Bazaar,3djd86,BabyEatin_Dingo,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:44 2015 UTC,Nice brushes are nice. I kinda feel the same way as you. Went with cheap brushes first but once I got nicer brushes I was much happier. My Thater and Simpson have now replaced all of my other brushes except my Plisson synthetic.

Shave_Bazaar,3ddhji,monolithe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"I believe the Fine's (no longer in production) is like their other splashes in that it only has alcohol, water, menthol, & fragrance.

Shave_Bazaar,3cx7mg,Banes_Pubes,3,Sun Jul 12 00:34:17 2015 UTC,Closer to a splash to a balm. Almost the exact texture as actual milk. Goes on like a splash but hydrates like a balm.

Shave_Bazaar,3cbxa3,nickmcmillin,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:27 2015 UTC,The Merkur 37c is a good affordable slant razor. Another option is is the iKon #102 (which costs $50 but you only get the head). The 102 seems to be out of stock everywhere though

It is YMMV, but a lot of people agree that it's a very aggressive razor."
Shave_Bazaar,3cbxa3,Bandt929,4,Mon Jul 6 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"This might be splitting hairs, but the 37C is not ""very aggressive"". People tend to equate razors that give them trouble as aggressive, while in reality, it's just that the razor isn't compatible with their technique, skin sensitivity, blade choice, etc.  On a 1-10 aggressive scale, with the mild Gillette Tech as 1 and the very aggressive Muhle R41 as 10, the 37C is closer to a 6."

Shave_Bazaar,3c98x1,thefrencharmy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"I mainly get a bright, clean citrus.  A bit of sweetness probably attributed to the melon and cucumber from Larry's scent profile, but I wasn't able to pull those out specifically from my one shave with it.  Unfortunately, I haven't used any soaps that are similar so I can't provide a comparison.  The only summer citrus scents I have are B&M Adagio (sweet cherry and lime) and MLS Paradise Frost (straight up grapefruit)."

Shave_Bazaar,3c01mv,KalutikaKink,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"I've missed it a few times and I'm used to the heartache. One day I'll get fed up and order a bottle of the aftershave instead considering I already have a lot of your soap and none of that Kyovu goodness.  Honestly I shave so infrequently that buying all the soap I could want feels like a disservice to the product. Not that you mind. Haha.  On the other hand, having a lot of your soap sitting around unused has allowed me to experience how the scents mature over time. Leviathan started with high marks from me and has only become more complex and interesting over the last 7 months. Noctourne has held up well and mellowed a bit making it less sweet and more woodsy. Not my favorite off the bat but very pleasing to my nose nowadays. It's really impressive and speaks not only to the skill you have as a fragrance blender but to the quality of the ingredients.  Any chance Bay Rum will be on shelf soonish?"
Shave_Bazaar,3c01mv,hedgehogsinhats,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:01:17 2015 UTC,Are you aware that both the soap and the aftershave are being discontinued?  Bay Rum should be back online sometime this week.

It's very gentle, and the main component is aloe vera juice, followed by witch hazel and chamomile extract. There will also be a super healing formula with tea tree oil that is good for keeping the skin from getting too oily. Eventually there will be an alcohol-based splash, but for now we're keeping with the gentle, nourishing approach.   But thanks, we're really glad you enjoyed it!

I have others that are beginning to hook but apparently that's different. I'm stealing from another forum because they mention some brushes you might try to find, but it's a good read just the same:  ""My understanding is that curled tips are not the same as gel tips. Curled tips typically indicate a very soft luxurious feeling. Gel tips have the curls, but also have a sticky or gooey texture and show a distinctive honey comb pattern after a good soak. I have tried several nice brushes that had curled tips (Thaters, Rooneys, M&Fs) but were not gel tipped. I have also tried authentic gel tipped brushes (Rooney Heritage 2-band 2011, recent Paladin Finest) and there is definitely a difference. To get a true gel tipped brush, you'll need to target a specific vendor/line/batch.""     Edit: Sorry, I realized that my reply doesn't really help all that much, I just enjoyed reading it and thought you might too. Good luck finding one!"

Shave_Bazaar,3bs9p7,troubledwatersofmind,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"The WD HMW aside, of the ones that are hooked or starting to hook, probably the only one I have that is as soft as my Plisson synth would be my Morris & Forndran blonde. I've got a PAV Brushworks that is pretty close, but still not quite as soft. That's setting a high bar though being compared to angel pubes and all. Other than my FS Finest and my Rooney Super Silvertip I would consider all of my badger brushes to be pretty darn soft. That being said, I think you are on the right track with the Thater or the Saville Row. They'll be expensive but they will have some of the best chances of getting what you want in current production brushes. I hear that some Shavemac brushes exhibit these qualities as well."

I got this one awesome one and then several months later I ordered some more hoping to get lucky again. Unfortunately the newer ones were really weird and floppy. The one I have feels like lathering with a big wet cotton ball. IIRC mine took probably 5-10 lathers before I started noticing the sticky/gummy look when wet.

I get a decent amount of cedarwood, and a bunch of other stuff I couldn't explain.  To me, it smells like university buildings.  So...yeah, maybe old libraries."

Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,zagood,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:44:22 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to get a straight razor for a while. Never used one. Would one of the Sight Unseen Razors be good to get for a first straight?
Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,awana4pigfood,2,Mon Jun 29 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. These are razors that have been bouncing around for a while that nobody had picked up. That are good razors. Some aren't cosmetically perfect or popular names. I wouldn't sell anything that I would not use personally.   You will need a strop as well so don't forget that.   Thanks for asking!"
Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,awana4pigfood,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:37:58 2015 UTC,I think I'll get one of those and strop then. I'll PM you. Thanks!

Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,13islucky,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:31:56 2015 UTC,I need a secondary for head shaving. I don't want to keep using my main SR because I find it annoying that I have to keep stropping on my diamond paste strop to keep it sharp. My head dulls the edge too fast. Can you recommend one of yours to me?
Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,Dimanovic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm what is your other SR? The grind on it?   I'm thinking that you may need a thicker blade, like a 1/4 hollow or near wedge. But that depends on what you currently have."
Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,5t4k3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:29:39 2015 UTC,I'm using the Art of Shaving rebranded Thiers Issard razor. I think its comparable to the TI ‘Special Coiffeur’ line. Its a full hollow 5/8 size.  I think I bigger thicker blade would be a better choice for head shaving. which do you think would be a good fit?
Shave_Bazaar,3bge7k,srawas89,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:36:56 2015 UTC,I agree. However one thing I need to point out which is unfortunate about ti blades lately is that they seem to be having steel quality issues which leads to weak edges.   Brad over at maggards has had plenty to say about this.   At any rate I will look at the list and make a few suggestions. Why don't you pm me?
Shave_Bazaar,3bfhzp,goldragon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:42 2015 UTC,Any interest in a trade? Looking to trade my Stainless RazoRock Stealth Slant for one of these.
Shave_Bazaar,3bfhzp,crippie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:36:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the interest but not really interested in a trade for another DE razor.  I am mainly a straight razor user.  The Mongoose was a one-off purchase because I had never tried an injector-style razor and I thought it looked awesome but it's just not something I want to keep long term so I am hoping to sell it on.

Shave_Bazaar,3bbki8,BabyEatin_Dingo,0,Sat Jun 27 18:52:35 2015 UTC,So someone said $100 to $150. I'm thinking $125.
Shave_Bazaar,3bbki8,RuggerRigger,2,Sat Jun 27 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"I was just teasing you about the vague nature of this post. I'm not actually in the market for more razors.  I think you've got some value there, but you'll have trouble selling them together and getting full price (whatever that is). In my experience people who aren't into single-edge razors won't want to pay a nickle for one. Or maybe you've got some real collectables there and someone like /u/alexandergjones will grab 'em all.  You should add the pic to your post's description. Then say that you're willing to make deals (if you are) and see what comes of it. All it will cost you is some extra shipping, but at least you'll actually be making the sales."
Shave_Bazaar,3bbki8,bigwalleye,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"found the picture in your post history. thats a pretty nice lot.  might fetch around 100 dollars if you sold them individually. good luck selling them all together.  id be interested in the DE razor on the top left. it looks to be a gillette new improved.  that's the star of the lot along with the gillette slim next to it, and the gillette single ring on the bottom.  the rest are a little more common or less desirable."

Shave_Bazaar,3azw9h,PromNightDingoBaby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:03 2015 UTC,It's a very woodsy floral scent.  It smells fantastic imo.  I personally love the scent but SWMBO doesn't really care for it.  Ginger's Garden is good stuff.  It too is a 100 ml bottle with ~90% left.
Shave_Bazaar,3azw9h,PromNightDingoBaby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:12:14 2015 UTC,I should have actually asked what I meant. How strong is the lavender? I'm not a big fan of lavender and that is the first thing mentioned in the description. The rest of the description sounds great though
Shave_Bazaar,3azw9h,reynoldslikesreddit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:17:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I didn't even pick up the lavender at all.  Didn't even realize until you said that that it even had lavender.  Had to give it another whiff lol. It's very subtle.

Shave_Bazaar,3axu78,rolatruck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:34:01 2015 UTC,Just had a quick look and the feather works out at £100 + £30 imports so it's about £20 cheaper than buying over here but £30 import is still a fair amount  The Standard is £35 + £15 import so also quite bit more but not bad considering I have been offered the standard here with a small defect for £40 - I'd rather pay £10 to get a new one with stand included
Shave_Bazaar,3axu78,merepekking,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:38:01 2015 UTC,Pm me regarding the standard. Might have something that'd interest you.

Shave_Bazaar,3aubjf,hemifieldsofgreen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"I am honestly blown away by your south simcoe sandalwood. The scent is incredible, I am lathering it up all the time even when I don't need to shave. Once my sample is used up I am ordering a full size. You have done something amazing here and it is the easiest soap to lather. I hands down recommend this for all beginners. It is a foolproof soap to use that produces an incredible lather and has a perfect scent profile and strength."

Shave_Bazaar,3am783,RocTraitor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"ha, so he spoiled his own surprise. I missed this development. Any specific reason it's switching from black to Latha?"
Shave_Bazaar,3am783,RocTraitor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:44:56 2015 UTC,"Because Black Label is being discontinued and I wanted to retain a pure lavender scent. White Label is reserved for more peculiar things, to Latha was the way to go."

Shave_Bazaar,3am53a,120inna55,2,Sun Jun 21 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"I just ordered Festival shave soap & scale polish.  Sounds interesting.  If the soap performs like Black Dragon, it could smell like horse poop and I'd still use it!  Very nice tallow soap.  I remember in a SOTD a good while back ""scale polish"" was mentioned.  When I inquired about it, I was told it wasn't yet in production.  Now when I go to the etsy store, I see it's there in several scents.  I went a bit overboard.  I ordered the scale polish in Festival to pair with the soap.  Then I had to get the Black Dragon scale polish to pair with the soap I already have (& love), then Green Dragon sounded intriguing as well, so I had to pick up the soap....and of course the pairing of the scale polish in the same scent!  Ended up dropping $60 just like that.  I need some constraint. Heheh.  Frankly, I probably don't need the Scale Polish.  With my Black Dragon tallow soap, I don't need much of a post product because of it's performance.  But the idea of a gel sounded interesting, so I'm looking forward to trying it."

Shave_Bazaar,3an7mr,BostonPhotoTourist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah =(  It's the very first EO that has not agreed with me.  I really, REALLY like the scent!  Usually it's FOs that get me.  I've had awesome luck with Lavanille, though, and am very curious about how my skin will handle the Solarion.  Your FOs are much ""cleaner"" than others.  Do you derive/concoct/synthesize (or whatever the word is) them yourself?  I've got like a 75%+ failure rate with other manufacturers and FOs."
Shave_Bazaar,3an7mr,BostonPhotoTourist,2,Mon Jun 22 03:14:41 2015 UTC,"I generally design my own, though it depends on what it is. Certain readily available scents like rose are just not worth making from scratch.   Are you sensitive to bay or clove?"
Shave_Bazaar,3an7mr,BostonPhotoTourist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"Clove gets me some tingling, bay seems neutral to me, cassia/cinnamon also gets some mild tingling as well.  It seems the sandalwood is the only EO that gives straight-up burn, though.  So far ABC's benzaldehyde is far and away the worst (red for hours), followed by TOBS Jermyn St & St James Bergamot & Sandalwood (burn for about an hour), then various FOs from the melt-and-pour days."
Shave_Bazaar,3an7mr,BostonPhotoTourist,2,Mon Jun 22 03:36:39 2015 UTC,Interesting. There's a small chance that Solarion might give you a bit of a tingle because it contains eugenol (major component in clove oil).
Shave_Bazaar,3an7mr,BostonPhotoTourist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"I'll keep an eye on it, geranium and petitgrain give me somewhat of a soothing sensation on the skin, which was a major reason I jumped on it!  Plus, saffron evokes some great nostalgic feelings from growing up best friends with an Iranian.  Tahdig was just about the greatest thing that existed in my world during the 90s!  On a side note, I'm hoping you keep putting out some experimental soaps in the Tre Citta formulation.  I love that formula in summers (will be very sad when the Anise & Vetiver is all gone.)"

Shave_Bazaar,3al4xg,nobodysawme,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:51:48 2015 UTC,I may still end up going that way. I think what I really would like is a parker 24c head on pretty much any other handle (seriously the handle is so ugly!) but by the time I buy that razor and a new handle I may as well just buy an r41.

Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,unbrownloco,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:17:12 2015 UTC,Yeah the boar I have right now is an Omega 10049 and once it got broken in I find myself really liking it more than the badgers I currently own. I'm hoping the SOC performs similarly and I get the feeling I'm not going to love badgers>boars until I drop upwards of $150-$300 for something in the 28mm+ size.
Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,silentisdeath,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:22:06 2015 UTC,Fair. My go to right now is a 24mm custom in TGN Finest which was 90ish  and I think it's the best I've owned. Look into those. Even for the bigger knots if you get someone to make it custom you can get it fairly inexpensive. Also check out Frank's shaving brushes super reasonable especially for those bigger knots
Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:41:15 2015 UTC,I'm hoping the SOC performs similarly   I have both the SOC boar and the Omega 10049 and they are both excellent but different. The SOC will take longer to break in than the 49 but it is worth it. Dynamite brush.
Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,unbrownloco,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:47:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, the 49 is a dynamite brush once it is all broken in as well. It just has such a long loft which i think helps it feel soft but I want to see how a shorter loft on a quality boar compares. The only real drawback to my boar vs badger is the soaking period. I never shave without showering anyhow so it really isn't a bother. Just gotta break the bristles in and they're face lathering beasts."
Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:03:11 2015 UTC,The only real drawback to my boar vs badger is the soaking period.

Shave_Bazaar,3ahe4c,unbrownloco,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Really? Heh, I wasn't aware there were pro's or cons to soaking badger. I don't rinse mine before loading it. Instead I just dunk it in the bowl I soak my boar in so that I'm certain there is water in and or around all the bristles."

Shave_Bazaar,39r9nn,visibleartifice,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:43:47 2015 UTC,I was looking at the Dr. Harris shave cream. Idk what your mark up is but at kent those were 30 bucks. I do like the fact you have vintage razors for sale (I recommend going to that antique shop in Strathmore to pick up some more as they always seem to have straight and safety razors). Really would like to see another shaving shop in Calgary (especially one that has knowledgeable staff and maybe some artisan shave soaps).
Shave_Bazaar,39r9nn,visibleartifice,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:51:41 2015 UTC,I would have another look. I compared their site to mine and I am a good $6-7 cheaper on all the creams and soaps from dr.harris. Some a little less. But I am cheaper on all the products for sure!  As for the vintage items I do have a great supplier already.
