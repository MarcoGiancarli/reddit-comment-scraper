To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.  In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.  Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.  Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dólar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.  Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.  greek man crying The image of Giorgos Chatzifotiadis crying outside a Greek bank was seen across the globe(Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images) No Bank Account? No Problem.  News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.  For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.  Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.  Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.  Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud."

Better productivity comes with innovation, progression and dynamism, which all stem from creativity. All humans have incredible creative potential, but the current education system and social norms suppress this. In fact, longer hours is one of the main factors that decreases productivity. People need space and time to process the fast flowing information of our world, they need to relax and be encouraged to see things differently, and be inspired by other creative thinkers. When we see our lives and our businesses in a different light we can identify the issues and develop solutions for them. But if we just continue to plow through our work, like we've been told we should do it, after some time that method becomes ineffective. It's important to approach work differently, but that only comes with creativity, and creativity comes with space and time."
postnationalist,3ctgzf,LithiumEnergy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"I would disagree that more creativity would actually lead to better economic outcomes, though. Having good ideas is important, yes, but you can only implement so many ideas at once as long as you have a certain standard of quality in implementation. And good ideas most often come from people who are highly proficient in their discepline. For example, a scientist working 70 hour weeks is far more likely to make a hundred nearly insignificant scientific discoveries (which are the discoberies that really drive human progress), than the ameture scientist who tinkers in her garage after work sometimes. The point is, not everybody can be a hero. Not everybody has ideas that are worth implementing. And, from a socioeconomic viewpoint, discepline and obedience are pretty good for the average worker to have.  Now, I'm still in  favor of giving workers more rights - a basic income, a shorter work week for full time, etc. I feel like quality of life would improve dramatically. However, saying with certainty that increased free time and creativity will lead to overall economic gain seems like guesswork at best."

They magically expect things to happen, for progress to happen, but have no concern about how the work actually occurs.

Lets get back to the subject. Nothing is inherently 'capitalist', and that is purely a metaphysical argument. Computers can conceivably be produced under any economic system. Just like everything else, computers were produced with research and labor. Research and labor don't belong to capitalism. They were around long before, and will certainly outlive it.

Particularly when referring to anarcho-capitalism and agorism. These are self organizing systems, grass roots, from the bottom up, as was 'punk rock' and many other social movements, like occupy. And many social movements may be advocating for nonsensical things, but they are still decentralized. Many punks were vegan, straightedge, and anarcho-socialists. By your argument, even though these movements are all grass roots and revolutionary against the current structures, it doesn't qualify unless bitcoin is also vegan because that's what punk rock was. Bitcoin is not being appropriated by the existing structure. It is replacing the current structure."

I don't think as someone on that thread suggested that we should have one government, because that's basically impossible. What I think is much better is more unity within various regions that share some sort of commonalities. Like Gamal Abdel-Nasser (2nd President of Egypt) attempted, yet failed, to make a united Arab Republic, where all Arabs from the Maghreb to the Gulf were united. This would do best for not only Arabs I believe, but ethnic minorites living in these countries. And Che Guevara wanted to have a united South America I believe, that is a goal that definitely would benefit all Latin Americans. Why? Because when people are more united, they have more of a standing in the world. The West today is able to control most countries in the world, because they're all on their own unable to fight powerful foreign forces. Nationalism, which was supposed to be a proper reaction to colonialism, has only made things easier for the West to colonize, either formally or informally."

postnationalist,3brdjv,PostNationalism,0,Wed Jul 1 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.  Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the ""starry-eyed internationalists"" who urged disarmament and who longed for a ""world state"" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one."

I'm a dual citizen of Canada and the USA who lives equally close to the border (US side) though my family is still up North, so we cross either way pretty frequently these days. These questions are all pretty much standard and both sides ask effectively the same questions. I answer succinctly (seriously, never offer more information than absolutely needed, you just confuse them. Confused border patrol agents default to detaining you and making things difficult) and politely, deal with the almost constant rudeness (oddly enough, I get that more going into Canada than the other direction), and I'm through in about 5 minutes, already forgetting the exchange by the time the crossing vanishes from the rear-view.  My family on the other hand, who are all Canadian citizens that refused to even cross the border for almost twenty years, always react the way you noticed this driver behaving. Doubly so when they're dealing with US agents, but they're pretty much unpleasant the entire way through. The most baffling part is how outraged they are whenever they end up being pulled to the side to be searched, as if it doesn't occur to them that antagonizing someone who decides whether or not you get to cross the border might make you suspicious... or at least enough of a pain in their ass to hassle you for a few hours in revenge.  Still, your last point is absolutely correct. I still remembering being able to freely cross the border with nothing more than a photo ID and birth certificate and every experience being mostly forgettable if not pleasant, the knee-jerk security measures after 9/11 was asinine to the extreme."

postnationalist,3alzjt,christ0ph,-1,Sun Jun 21 15:11:49 2015 UTC,"While all developing countries – from the least developed to middle-income – can celebrate accomplishments in their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), critical gaps remain. Despite vast diversities, African, Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island and Middle-Income Countries share, to varying degrees, many common challenges on their path to equitable sustainable development. These include: poverty, growing inequality, hunger, food insecurity, improving public health and education, providing social protection, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, changing age structures, growing pressures on resources, and climate change. Some countries also face conflict situations or post-conflict fragilities. In many, the globalization of inequality and social exclusion is leading to increased social unrest and dissatisfaction with current models and trends of development. In various cases, these challenges are aggravated and perpetuated by weaknesses in democratic governance and institutional capacity, weak infrastructure, debt burdens, economic crisis, corruption, funding shortfalls, and declines in development cooperation.  This brief focuses on three key pillars for achieving social, economic and environmentally sustainable development:  Advancing the human rights of women and girls and gender equality; The rights and empowerment of adolescents and youth; Sexual and reproductive health and rights for all. These are essential, cross-cutting foundations for a post-2015 people-centred and planet-sensitive development agenda. They are mutually-reinforcing prerequisites for progress, relevant for all countries regardless of their stage of development. They are also smart, effective and cost-saving investments with multiple payoffs across a range of development objectives.  A human rights-based and holistic approach to sustainable development must address multiple dimensions of discrimination and exclusion, including for women and young people as the two largest demographic groups in the world facing inequality and insecurity. Sexual and reproductive health problems – which are preventable – take a huge toll on lives, families, productivity, economies and public budgets. They entrench poverty and erode development prospects, and represent costs and burdens that can and must be lifted. The limited investments in these key areas is a major reason why many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achieved—an important lesson for crafting the post-2015 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals."

It's part and parcel of the tribal mentality that we owe the current state of the world to - in fact, a lot of modern nations can trace their beginnings back to religious-tribal groups. If nations tomorrow stopped existing somehow, people would organize according to religion or any other artificial separation was at hand, and keep fighting between themselves.  In the hierarchy of human priorities, there is always going to be ""my group"" before ""all humanity"" as long as there exists a group that preaches itself to be fundamentally different from others."

As the coin price went up, guess what happened? Their debt and their repayments, denominated in buttcoins, became more valuable!   Of course, they tried to argue to their creditors that their debts should be denominated in dollars. The creditors, obviously, thought otherwise.

Conversely, what would happen is the old men at the federal reserve got economic policy wrong, which is all behind closed doors.

Do you have any education about how currency markets work in the real world?  The US Dollar is a real currency. The Yen is a real currency. Bitcoin is no more of a real currency than Dogecoin was.   I didn't ask if the algorithm was legit I asked what would happen if it was discovered it wasn't legit after people had invested ?  Hint: not much.   If the Fed gets policy wrong no one should be punished.  If they crashed the economy intentionally they would be punished.  Companies may come and go but when the largest exchange of Bitcoin loses millions of its investor's/customer's monies and no one gets punished it should suggest to you how BS bitcoin is at its core.   The internet is here to stay but Bitcoin likely will die in the next decade.  Hardly anyone uses Napster, Betamax or Altavista anymore as the first widely used tech gets replaced by something better. Bitcoin will see the same thing happen.   If, for example, a newly freed Hong Kong created a currency based on/tied to their economy that could be more viable. Bitcoin's largest weakness is its lack of enforcement."

postnationalist,39xp89,PostNationalism,2,Tue Jun 16 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you. It seems that increasing international trade is both a practical inevitability (someone will do it if we don't) and a generally proven means of increasing communities' total wealth, but almost all of that wealth increase ends up going to the wealthiest individuals and companies who have the resources to invest in newly opened markets and influence trade regulations to their advantage. That might just be the nature of capitalist economic systems and an unavoidable problem of international trade, but they can be at least partially ameliorated with deliberately redistributive taxing and aggressive social safety net spending.   If we get to TPP 2.0, I would love to see requirements that governments provide certain levels of public education, childcare, healthcare, anti-poverty assistance, and old age assistance. There's an economic and humanitarian argument for all those things, and that would make everything else they're trying to achieve much easier for me to stomach, personally."

postnationalist,39tls3,PostNationalism,5,Sun Jun 14 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"My prediction is this.  Automated technology is either in development or already in existence, albeit in an expensive capacity. I predict these technologies will become cheap to implement and widely available to businesses and consumers within the next ten to twenty years - depending on regulations.  As a result, certain industries (such as manufacturing and transportation) will downsize considerably, replacing the vast majority of their employees with machines. Three such technologies that I think will symbolise the Automatic Age are the 3D printer, the self-driving car, and self-learning robots and I honestly believe these three alone will outperform humans to the point where jobs will disappear in droves.  Due to the knock-on effect this will have, I foresee a worldwide job crisis with many careers disappearing and governments having to pick up the pieces with welfare budgets that have already been cut and stretched to their absolute limits thanks to the current trend towards austerity. With hundreds of millions losing their jobs and our 'will-work-for-food' mentality, this can only lead to one thing. Revolts.  When revolts come into play - and the possibility of a global chemical, biological or even nuclear class war breaking out, depending on the corporate and political response towards said revolts - the results are going to be disastrous.  Is there anyone that has done any thorough research into the possible effects that automation will have on the global economy? If not, is there room for that, because I might want to look into this field."
postnationalist,39tls3,Clbull,4,Mon Jun 15 03:59:32 2015 UTC,"Just a thought  If such a scenario were to happen, where the middle class lost a severe portion of their income, would it not automatically have to be a world where the price of goods and services were made cheaper to such a degree that the reduced incomes would not matter? After all, a world where the middle class had no means to buy those goods and services would mean that they simply wouldn't be provided in the first place. So, shouldn't that scenario be literally impossible? In the movie Elysium, just to use as a vivid example, you have great income inequality where the distribution of  people by income is very bottom-heavy. Wouldn't such a scenario only be possible if corporations stopped acting rationally (enough) with profit in mind? That is, in that world, corporations that want to maximize profit (taken as a whole) would then seem to favor more equal income distribution unless the people at the top of the income distribution were inclined to spend more per wealth they own."

Other False Flags ..   The Mukden Incident also known as the Manchurian Incident, was a staged event used as a pretext for the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931.  The Gleiwitz Incident was a staged attack against Germany, August 31, 1939, by Nazi forces posing as Poles, used to justify the German invasion of Poland.  The Gulf of Tonkin Incident August 2, 1964, North Vietnamese torpedo boats were falsely alleged to have attacked USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin, precipitating the Vietnam War!

postnationalist,39tcen,AntioneDeJersy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"In fact, the US-Philippine War (the Spanish-Amercan War was over in 2 weeks - akin to the Blitzkrieg of the Iraq invasion), is the closest similar war in US history to the Iraq war. Exactly like Iraq, the Philippines went 3rd-order guerrilla instantly and bogged down US forces causing more blowback than any good achieved. Similarly the US resorted to what are now called ""War Crimes, ""Crimes Against Humanity"" and ""Genocide"" in putting Filipino women and children into the Boer War invented ""concentration camps"" when the men from a village had gone to the Bundok (""mountain(s)"" in Tagalog - source of our word ""boondocks"") to fight the guerrilla war against the Americas. This was done again in Vietnam as ""protective hamlets"" which were always involuntary and unviable for the detainees inside them. In Iraq, it was ""every able-bodied man"" who was put into a concentration camp or targeted by a drone.  The Fil-Am war started when the Americans had promised, in writing, to free Filipinos from the Spanish to form a new Philippine nation under Filipino rule, and then reneged on the promise. The phrase ""our little brown bothers"" comes from this era as the excuse to break the agreement. The attitudes are summed up in political cartoons of the time: 1[1]  , 2[2]   and 3[3]  . This really no different from attitudes prevalent today about arabs and muslims. We simply call the all ""terrorists"" as a direct substitute for ""nxxxxx"" as used in 1899. Nothing has changed.  Today the US does the equivalent when it drone attacks wedding parties and funerals or puts innocents in concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Camp X Ray to be killed and to attempt indoctrination which often failed. In the latter case, stronger guerrilla nationalists were created as a result (i.e. ISIS which is largely led by former Saddam-era Baathist-ex-military-officers).  Even today, there is still a smoldering nationalist, anti-American thread in Philippine society; it's what got the US bases (over 2,000 under Marcos) kicked out by Cory Aquino. That the US had to have 2,000 bases simply to maintain control tells you a lot. The same will occur in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The US also managed to coopt various guerrilla movements with only marginal success in the Philippines. The communist NPA guerrilla was CIA-owned by the 1980s and actively used against the Philippine government and society broadly to ""achieve US policy"" but the Muslim MILF/Huks never were."

If workers are much more productive in one country than in another, restrictions on immigration lead to large efficiency losses. The paper quantifies these losses, using a model in which efficiency differences are labor-augmenting, and free trade in product markets leads to factor price equalization, so that wages are equal across countries when measured in efficiency units of labor. The estimated gains from removing immigration restrictions are huge. Using a simple static model of migration costs, the estimated net gains from open borders are about the same as the gains from a growth miracle that more than doubles the income level in less-developed countries."

H1-B visa program doesn't pose nearly as much of a threat, because H1-B visa employees are still paid US wages with required benefits.  (Even if they are slightly lower).  Statistically, H1-B visa employees are paid about the same as entry level employees (which are normally lower than more experienced employees).  The bigger threat to US tech jobs is the true ""outsourcing"", where the outsourcing consultant companies bring ""trainee"" from other countries, have them trained by the US employees, and then have them go back to their home countries to do the job of the US employees (with less than 1/4 of the pay).  But the ""trainees"" are not H1-B visa holders.  They are under a different set of visas."

postnationalist,391bis,skyanvil,0,Mon Jun 8 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"True, but they still have to be paid at a prevailing wage.  Companies cannot have a different set of wages for H1-b's.  That's illegal.  The most the company will do is to pay them at the lowest possible wage at their performance level and seniority.  Which is probably how it happens.  But still, that means that H1-B's actually don't save the companies that much money.  The company in the old days would hire 2-3 junior engineers for the same salary they pay for 1 senior engineer.  Nowadays, they would do the same, except 1 of the 3 would be a H1-B.  So, it's basically the same trend.  If any one is to blame for this, it's the old capitalist mentality from the Greedy 1980's, when everyone became replaceable, and US corporate management came to believe that the best way to show good corporate quarterly is by ""cost cutting"", usually by firing 1 old employee and replace him/her with 2-3 young employees.  Once that mentality is set in place in US corporations, H1-B and outsourcing are no big deals."

This is very similar to the US government's pay scale system.  Honestly, it is a pain for the company to hire H1-B.  It required so much paperwork, that most managers didn't want to do it.  (The immigration paperwork alone is quite a headache.  The company had to hire dedicated immigration lawyers to do the paperwork.  Then, they had to advertise every H1-B's job for at least 30 days, and show evidence that none of the US applicants were qualified to do the same job)."

More specifically, this inequality is measured as the gap between the ‘representative’ or ‘average’ individuals of any two countries, be they Morocco and Spain or Mexico and the US. For simplicity, let’s call this ‘locational’ inequality."
postnationalist,38n7ef,PostNationalism,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:34:03 2015 UTC,"It is as obvious as it is well known that the world is unequal in terms of individuals’ incomes (e.g. Mohammed 2015).  But it is unequal in a very particular way – when split into ‘inequality within countries’ and ‘inequality between countries’, the latter accounts for by far the biggest gap.  Inequality within countries measures, for instance, gaps between poor and rich Americans or between poor and rich Chinese. For simplicity, let’s call it ‘class’ inequality. But there is also another equally obvious inequality – that between rich and poor nations. More specifically, this inequality is measured as the gap between the ‘representative’ or ‘average’ individuals of any two countries, be they Morocco and Spain or Mexico and the US. For simplicity, let’s call this ‘locational’ inequality.  Inequality, as it is commonly understood in today’s world, is such that whatever measure we choose, the lion’s share of global inequality is ‘explained’ by the differences in mean incomes between countries.  This was not always the case. Although our data for the past are far more tentative than our data for today’s global income distribution, we can still state with little doubt that the dominant type of equality in the 19th century was that within countries (see Milanovic 2011).  Citizenship premiums and penalties If income differences between countries are large then your income will significantly depend on where you live, or even on where you were born (97% of the world’s population remain in the countries where they were born). This is what I call a ‘citizenship premium’ (or a ‘citizenship penalty’) – a ‘rent’ that a person receives if he or she happens to be born in a rich country, or, if we use the terminology introduced by John Roemer, an ‘exogenous circumstance’ which is independent from any one individual’s effort and episodic luck (Roemer 2000).  How big is citizenship rent, how does it vary with one’s position in the income distribution, and what does it imply for global inequality of opportunity and migration?  Estimating citizenship rent I estimate citizenship rent by using data collected from household surveys conducted in 118 countries in and around the year 2008 (Milanovic 2015). For each country, I have micro-level (household) data ordered into 100 percentiles, with individuals ranked by their household per capita income. This gives 11,800 country/percentiles with ‘representative’ per capita incomes expressed in dollars of equal purchasing parity, making incomes across countries comparable.  I ‘explain’ these incomes using only one variable – the country where individuals live. Of course, people living in the US will tend to have higher incomes at any given percentile of the distribution than people living in poor countries in, for instance, Africa. But how will it look for the world as a whole? In a least-square dummy variable regression, I use Congo (the poorest county in the world) as the ‘omitted country’ so that I can express the citizenship premium in every other country in terms of the income gain compared to Congo. The premium for the US is 355%, it is 329% for Sweden and 164% for Brazil. But for Yemen, another very poor country, it’s 32%.  According to this regression, we can explain more than two-thirds of the variability in incomes across country/percentiles by only one variable – the country where people live. This estimation shows that, as we thought, a lot of our income depends on where we live.  Citizenship rent across the distribution But this is only an average premium that compares countries. Does citizenship rent vary along the entire income distribution? If I were to take into consideration only people belonging to the lowest part of the income distribution in each country, would the premium still be the same?  Intuition may help here. Suppose that I focus only on the incomes of the lowest decile (with rich countries more equal than poor countries). Then the gap between rich and poor countries should be greater for the very poor people than for the average individual.  And this is indeed what we find – Sweden’s citizenship premium compared to Congo is now 367% versus 329% on average. But Brazil’s is 133% versus 164%.  The situation at the top is exactly the opposite – Sweden’s advantaged position at the 90th percentile of the income distribution is ‘only’ 286%, but Brazil’s becomes 188%.  Implications for migration The existence of the citizenship premium has obvious implications for migration: people from poor countries will have the opportunity to double or triple their real incomes by moving to a rich country.  But the fact that the premium varies as a function of one’s position in the income distribution carries additional implications. If I consider moving to one of two countries that have the same average income, my decision on where to migrate – based on economic criteria alone – will also be influenced by my expectations regarding where I may end up in the recipient county’s income distribution. My decision will thus be influenced by the extent to which the recipient country’s income distribution is unequal.  Suppose that Sweden and the US have the same mean income. If I expect to end up in the bottom part of a recipient country’s distribution, then I should migrate to Sweden. The poor people in Sweden are better off compared to the mean, and the citizenship premium, evaluated at lower parts of distribution, is greater. The opposite conclusion follows if I expect to end up in the upper part of the recipient country’s distribution – I should migrate to the US.  This last result has unpleasant implications for rich countries with greater ‘in-country’ equality. More equal rich countries will tend to attract lower-skilled migrants who generally expect to be placed in the bottom part of the recipient country’s distribution. Developing a national welfare state would have the perverse effect of attracting migrants who can contribute less.  Even in this rough sketch, we also have to consider the levels of social mobility in recipient countries because more unequal countries with strong social mobility will, everything else being the same, tend to appeal to more skilled migrants.  Global inequality of opportunity The mere existence of a large citizenship premium implies that there is no such a thing as global equality of opportunity because a lot of our income depends on the accident of birth.  So should we strive for global equality of opportunity or not? It is a political philosophy question that philosophers have thought much more about than economists. Some, following John Rawls in The Law of Peoples, believe that this is not an issue and that every argument for global equality of opportunity would conflict with the right of national self-determination. But other political philosophers like Thomas Pogge believe that in an interdependent world, the dominant role of chance in people’s life is not to be accepted lightly (Pogge 2008). I am not proposing a solution to this issue, yet, I believe that economists should not shy away from addressing it.1  As gaps between nations diminish, mostly thanks to the high growth rates of Asian countries, the citizenship rent will tend to reduce. But there is such a huge gap today that even a century of much higher growth in poor countries (in comparison to rich countries) will not eradicate citizenship rent.  However, it will reduce. As it does, it will also reduce overall global inequality. This might then lead us to a world not dissimilar to the mid-19th century, in which class is again more important for one’s global income position than location.  Do I hear the distant sound of Marx?"

postnationalist,37rupe,PostNationalism,0,Fri May 29 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"Mass migration occurred in the early 20th Century to fill voids in low level service roles (such as British transport hiring from West Indies) and industrial roles. Since industry was moved to Asian sweatshops in the 1980's Western countries no longer need migration on the same scale as before. Also, you have to factor in the generations wiped out in both World Wars which reduced European workforces hugely.  We now have economies built on the service and financial sectors. Former industrial workers and their children no longer have a market for that type of work and thus perform low level service roles, reducing the need for migrants.  The reason voters hate migrants is because of the spin the State and media put on the issue. The fact is without migrants Western economies would collapse. But if the indigenous population became one with the migrant population the masses would not stand for the injustices committed toward immigrants. That means they'd have to be paid more and their housing and work conditions improved, meaning that you might as well just pay a person born in the country. Also, the fearmongering brings public support for contract workers, in Britain if you leave the job you came to the country to do (even if you have a new one lined up) you can be deported.  And of course most migrants aren't low-skilled, in Britain throughout the 20th C. a higher percentage of migrants (compared to indigenous Brits) were actually skilled workers. The NHS is a perfect example of an institution entirely dependent on foreign workers.   The economy isn't as it once was, we do have millions of foreigners building our country, but instead of bringing them here we just bring the products of their labour here and pay them pennies."

The reasonable way to reduce poverty by lowering birth rates is education, empowering women and affording women equal rights.

Let's assume that half even ""steal"" a job that pays $10k per year.  Like most jobs at that rate, let's assume that it is a job that you do not want, but are happy that someone does.  If those jobs would still not be something you want to do at $15k per year, but that is the pay that would be needed to fill them with a non immigrant that is slightly more desperate than you but not quite as desperate as them, then that is a $5k in savings for work that you consume.  So, 10m immigrants provides $100B of spending that can funnel to you, and $25B of labour savings/cost reductions on things that you spend.  If you own a house, then the more people there are taking up other houses, the more people will want to buy your house."
postnationalist,36skz5,Godspiral,-1,Thu May 21 21:14:16 2015 UTC,Big business love immigration because it drives down wages while the left loves it because they feel nice and warm inside.   Meanwhile the fuckers in the middle who pay the taxes get screwed.

Zomahoun is the president and CEO of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), a growing network of educational and research institutes that hopes to move the continent’s most capable intellectuals into the global spotlight.  There are three formal AIMS undertakings: a master’s degree program in Mathematical Sciences, research, and teacher training. The master’s program offers free tuition to accepted students and trains them in both general principles – problem formulation, the scientific method, communication – and cutting-edge math in subjects including computer science, biomathematics, and financial mathematics. Research will allow for international collaborations and advanced student training.      Of course, you also need promising talent and inspiring teachers, and Zomahoun is scouring the continent for precocious youth in an effort he’s calling the Next Einstein Initiative. “AIMS is training Africa’s brightest students,” he says, “and we’re trying to provide solutions to the critical issues that the continent is facing.”   The news is great, but popularization is going to get sniggered at because ofunfortunate and misleading branding. Zomahoun needs better PR. Flashy aspirations don't inspire investment, hope and trust as much as the perception of a steady and reliable hand."

People don't naturally want to kill each other they need to be encouraged. They need someone to tell them that everyone hates them, and that you should be in fear and strike first.  Protectionism in this day and age is about ideas and information more than anything.  Protectionism in the IP and Nationalism spheres is a serious problem. It creates conflict where none exists. No one has a right to life without competition. Who would want that any way? Only the person who is in fear that someone simpler who spent less can pass them simply because they had the chance to compete. You seem to be giving the credit of individuals working voluntarily together to the state when it is sorely undeserved. The only thing a state can do is cause fear and violence to achieve its objectives and pay for it through theft.  Individuals don't have violence as their only option. We are flexible creatures that can adapt to any situation that is why we still exist and evolution didn't snuff us out. Not because a state held/forced our hand the whole time. My guess is that the happiest people on this planet are the ones who have turned their backs on the state and just live instead.   Centralization works fine on a micro scale. Where individuals come and go of their own free will. Anything beyond a relatively small number of people and you lose concensus and ultimately have to force an ever greater number of people to go along with the vocal minority. Look at elections lately they tend to have 60% or less turn out. Meaning the ""winner"" is usually only supported by less than a 1/4 of the population."

The TPP will objectively make people's lives worse. We're talking allowing pharmaceutical companies to prevent the production of generic drugs. For some perspective, 80% of retrovirals used in the developing world are generic. It will mean the biggest entertainment companies (mostly American) can order websites in other countries to be shut down if they claim there's a copyright violation. And yes it will be bad for US workers, it will be bad for all workers. The people who will benefit from this are the more powerful states in the agreement and their ruling classes.  This is absolutely not some effort to erode nationalism or nations. Why would the US instigate it and participate in it if it was? This is the US organising it's friendly forces into an agreement against China, which you will notice is conspicuously absent from all this. The US's goal is to contain China, it's fastest growing rival, and this is just the latest episode in American imperialism. Unify (to an extent) national economies to be able to compete economically with China, which the US is now incapable of doing alone. Bad for US workers, but the US ruling class will make off like bandits out of this. Of course this is the reason that workers aren't supposed to know the contents of this agreement. We only know what we do know due to Wikileaks.   I'm not going to be fighting for the TPP because if I was I'd be fighting for US imperialism.

Domestic low/unskilled labor markets are also necessary given the high cost of continued education and a dearth of positions available to college grads. A domestic low skill, non-service industry also preserves the value of college and trade schools by providing a constructive outlet to those unable or unwilling to further their education (not counting trades and OJT). An important follow on to this is that the economy is no longer constrained by student debt as those fewer people will have to pursue loans...yet those that do will be in much more lucrative positions and be able to pay them off faster.

No it doesn't, population caps are mere instruments of the market economy to keep the current trend afloat. The entirety of the human population would easily fit into Rhode Island and the entirety of mankind would be able to sustain itself with less surface than Australia (under ideal circumstances of course, I'm just giving an outlook of the fallacy of pop caps and regional restrictions). Let's not overlook in your given example that a lot of Canada is also basically an arctic wasteland, while other parts are virtually untouched by infrastructure. 1km2 in the lush plains of the Dominican Republic is not equal to 1km2 in Greenland.   I believe even domestic population growth here in the UK is unsustainable, the same story goes for many other EU countries.   Believe what you want, we are still far away from the limit. Besides, I already mentioned it requires cooperation between all member states of the EU, ideally the entirety of Europe to tackle this hurdle, introduce quotas and properly distribute people. That way more densely populated countries like Belgium, or the UK don't have to carry an exponentially bigger burden compared to sparsely populate, yet wealthy ones like Scandinavia and Finland.   I used to be pretty left wing, now I think that many countries out there need to fix their cultural and religious problems and join the rest of the world. Including the UK, A country doesn't need to have a first world economy to be livable, but it needs to be progressive and deal with it's demons.   Agreed, however we don't have the luxury to pick one point and merely work on that, societies are dynamic and changes occur too slowly to keep up with the ever changing facets of the modern world, as such we have to work on all issues simultaneously if possible, or optimise it and solve/improve multiple concerns with one legislation."

Italy, I'm not only in one of the worst off countries economically, badly hit by the crisis but also the one that carries the brunt of the boat people.   These are all problems that make us very much ill equipped for a drastic population increase, especially when that is an influx of people with lower skills and rough grasp of the language.  And no, the more people you cram into a place the faster diseases spread, the more pressure on infrastructure occurs. Healthcare and education suffer, people end up stuck on employment and crime rises.   Precisely my point why dumping them into the wild of Canada will hardly do people any justice and why rich, better equipped countries are more favourable, because of infrastructure. To stay with this example, Canada has a higher immigrant ration than the UK, just slightly less in total, with far less overall population."

postnationalist,358itv,PostNationalism,3,Fri May 8 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"> To the black residents of Ferguson, proximity to this evidence that the American Dream is a reality for whites must be a chronic irritant in the best of times, an unbearable provocation in the worst. Under such socio-economic conditions it is difficult to sustain functional families and vibrant communities.  This is sort of a non-sequitur rant.  I understand his feelings, but the claim ~blacks feel that whites have an American Dream that blacks don't have~ =>  ""it is difficult to sustain functional families"" doesn't really follow.    >  All we have to do is to clean up the slums, provide top notch schools capable of competing with those in Finland, bring some jobs back that have been exported to distant shores, and we should be in good shape.   Oh, that's all we have to do?  Seriously, let's think about those three problems.   1 clean up the slums -- I'm not sure what he means by this.  Reduce crime and gang activity?  So I suppose that implies more policing?  I'm sure that will go over well.  Or perhaps we should reduce crime by legalizing drugs (something I think would actually work.  Alas, what is economically feasible is rarely politically feasible and visa-versa)?  Maybe he means treating the underlying social pathologies, whatever those are (unwed childbirth? 90% of urban black children are born to unwed mothers)? That's a complicated problem without a clear solution (we don't know much about why unwed childbirth has risen so much in the last 50 years, or even what its effect has been, much less how to reverse the trend).  Maybe he means we need to literally beautify the ghetto?  I don't know.  Whatever he means, it's not going to have a simple solution.    2 - create top notch schools like those in Finland -- lots of people are working on this, and again, there's no simple solution.  First of all, Finland's schools are outstanding in large part because Finland doesn't have a large disadvantaged subpopulation suffering from a variety of social pathologies.  That's precisely the problem we are trying to solve.  See https://ed.stanford.edu/news/poor-ranking-international-tests-misleading-about-us-performance-new-report-finds   for example. I should also point out that fixing the school system does not constitute the proverbial ""saving capitalism from capitalism"", since the primary and secondary school systems are almost entirely public.  One might argue that Tiebout Choice implies that school quality is still in some sense a market good, but equalizing funding and centralizing administration doesn't seem to solve the problem (see the Kansas City, Missouri, fiasco for example).  Improving low-quality schools is tricky business and it won't amount to copy-catting Finland or simply increasing funding.   3 - bring jobs back from overseas -- What is he proposing here?  Trade restrictions?  Incentives for manufacturing?  I'm not sure. In any case, I am not hopeful for any policy solution that depends on an increase in manufacturing labor demand. First of all, the nature of manufacturing is rapidly changing.  Although decreases in low-skilled manufacturing labor demand are partly attributable to outsourced manufacturing (Acemoglu and Autor have convinced me), there is no going back. Manufacturing grows more automated with every passing year.  And the sorts of workers these plants hire are more highly trained (often with engineering degrees). So, even if costly trade barriers or business incentives could bring more factories to the States, they are unlikely to put a dent in the black underemployment problem.  Second, notwithstanding the recent economic doldrums, the fundamental problem is one of worker qualification, not the absence of jobs. Which brings us back to education and social pathology.    I don't want to sound pessimistic.  But the author is stunningly blase about implementing effective policy.  Everyone agrees that that the urban under-education, underemployment, and social pathologies need to be fixed.  Nobody really knows, concretely, how to do it.   TLDR; the author takes a jab at capitalism by talking about serious social problems, which are neither clearly of market origin nor exclusively concerns of the left.  He closes by proposing some vapid ""solutions""."

Worker owned coops seem like a great alternate to privately held companies, but why can't these both exist?    ""The state will inevitably fall. Society, which will reorganise production on the basis of a free and equal association of the producers, will put the whole machinery of state where it will then belong: into the museum of antiquity, by the side of the spinning-wheel and the bronze axe.”    I generally advocate voluntarism and nonstatism, so the idea of the dissolution of the state works for me. I'm guessing the disagreement is on property rights, unless you think individual ownership of property can coexist with collectively owned property."
postnationalist,34w565,silver_bubble,3,Tue May 5 07:41:34 2015 UTC,"How are complex things like computers or rockets to be built?   By work/workers.  All new value comes from work/workers.  Removing the parasite exploiting those workers does not stop them from producing things, even complex things.  Here's just one example of a co-op (not a perfect co-op) with 75,000 workers & they make all sorts of complex things: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation   Is this fully compatible with the non-aggression principle which non-statists use?    First, there is no ""non aggression principle"" except for people who refuse to own the land/earth.  People don't agree who owns what land/earth, & thus they attempt to enforce their opinions.  ie, the truth is to ""own land"" (or the earth in other ways) requires violence towards peaceful people.    The very concept of ""owning the land"" is a threat of violence to deprive others of the land/earth.  Note: I am not saying all forms of violence/property are wrong.  We socialists/anarchists oppose exploitative property, not personal property.    Next, you speak of ""non statists.""  Lots of people pretend to be anarchists but they are not.  The primary pseudo-anarchist is the capitalist class.    The truth is a capitalist business is a state/government. Q. What is a state/government?  A. Any group (whether you call it a ""business"" or anything else) that claims territory (absentee land ownership) to violently control (ie ""govern"") the public.  Basically, a capitalist's ""business"" functions in the exact same way as a small state/government.  They hide this by using the language of business.     Example:    Instead of ""laws"" & ""law makers,"" they have rules & rule makers.    Instead of police mercenaries, they have ""private"" mercenaries.    Those ""mercenaries"" would function in the same way: enforcing the property/territory, the rules/laws, etc.    And this ""business"" can collect income via ""rents"" instead of ""taxes.""      ie, they're the same thing since they function the same.  And using different language doesn't change that.       There are really essentially just two systems.  Anarchism & statism.    Anarchism:   If anarchism is achieved then socialism is achieved.    (The public is not deprived of the land/resources by a violent class of explotiers.)  And thus they claim the land & own their means of production.   Statism.   Aka capitalism.  Territory (absentee land ownership) is used to control & exploit the public.   ie, in anarchism you only claim land for personal property,  & statism/capitalism the ruling class claims land/territory to violently control the public.   unless you think individual ownership of property can coexist with collectively owned property.   There are not socialists ranting that no form of individual property should exist.  Even Marx argued for personal property.  Marx said exploitative property should be abolished & personal property should continue.   ""Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property... [Which is] the system of producing & appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.""   -- Manifesto ch2."

postnationalist,34qvav,JasonLeeH,1 point,Mon May 4 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Making the available Bitcoin in circulation smaller is idiotic.    Again you resort to name calling, rather then explaining why that would actually be a problem.   If you really believe in the long-term viability of Bitcoin, you wouldn't be purposefully trying to undermine it.    Since you didn't explain your first point, no basis to support your claim of it being undermined.   Yes, I know Bitcoin can be delineated down to 8 decimal places, but that's irrelevant. If it was relevant, Bitcoin would have a major inflation problem.    Seems you don't understand math very well. Using decimal places has nothing to do with inflation.   The point is that most of the current BTC supply is already in the hands of extremely wealthy people.    So your point is that you don't like bitcoin because you don't think it's fair who has it, and had nothing to do with your original claims.   Making middle-class or lower-class consumers of the OpenBazaar discard their wealth   So suddenly the option only apples to lower and middle class now, as if they were being discriminated against when actually ask openbazzar users are equal and get the same options.   for no other reason than to say ""This person is legit"" is probably the most backwards implementation of a review system I've ever heard of.   It's an option that the public has requested and the open source community of developers provided.

Will they need education? Language classes? Healthcare? Europe's social services are already stretched. Who shall pay for it all?

On your second point: governments are not peoples. They may strive to represent them, but democracy indices generally find most of Africa wanting. More explicitly, the inability of the incumbent political economy and public choice systems in most African countries to move to a low-corruption equilibrium does not amount to an inability of people to govern themselves, only an inability to change their government. Self governance right now would generally require a lot of civil wars, or the resolution of problems resembling civil wars. That almost never happens without external intervention, for a reason known in game theory as a credibility problem."
