MealPrepSunday,3e1skf,sherrying,11,Tue Jul 21 08:17:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not Vegan. At all. Let me clarify that. I just ate a ton of meat and carbs all weekend so I wanted to go the other way. Also the Salmon I had gotten for the meal prep had living worms on it and I couldn't handle it; I'm a wuss. However, I had a four pack of tofu to kill and a new desire not to eat animals until I could forget the salmon worms and it was a busy work night so had to hit two hours or so for meals.  I found this sub two months ago and I've been trying to prep for weekdays as much as possible ever since. I was too lazy and cramped for time but i've gotten much faster. This took about 2.5 hours! Thank you meal prep subreddit for making this happen!  I don't have recipes because I always just grab what looks good and make it up since I have a lot of cooking experience.  It's probably a wordy experience of meal prepping rather than recipe but maybe I can lay it out on an instructables."

MealPrepSunday,3e1skf,caustickitten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Here is a bomb BEST quinoa recipe. Although, it's not so recipe-like since I just make things up as I cook.   I put a small pot to boil with two cups of water in it I had about 1 1/4 cup of quinoa left so I rinsed that in my rinsing bowl in sink over and over until the water ran clear. I strained the water the best I could without losing the Quinoa. Then I added the soggy wet quinoa to the boiling pot. (normal Quinoa instructions) I figured the extra water from not draining well would just about cover the extra 1/4 cup. (Quinoa is about 2 cups of water to each cup of grain.)   Into this I added the bottom of a tub of Better than Bouillon, about a tablespoon and a half (this was too salty go for just a tbspn if you are not a salt fiend like me). As it cooked, I added two tablespoons of coconut oil. I tasted the water. It was salty so I saw that I would need to bulk this up with more flavor. I put about a half cup of slivered almonds.  I lowered the heat a little bit so it was less aggressive boil. I added some white pepper, about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of Chile flakes, a few turns on the pepper grinder. Then I tasted it and added a spoon of Penzeys Fox Point seasoning (optional if you don't have it) which I use in small amounts only because I'm cooking for my bf who is really sensitive to garlic and onions.  Oh btw, if you can eat garlic and onions, shove that stuff all up in this recipe. Use a lot of garlic and sliver up some red onion to toss with, and garnish everything with green onions and fried shallots. Do it for those of us who can't.  Back to BEST quinoa ever. So it took about 20 minutes for the quinoa to absorb all the water. I probably added too much by not draining the Quinoa. Anyways, I taste it and the flavors are nice but it needs to be less salty and it needs to have more mouth feel. So I dump in two more spoons of coconut oil and throw in the entire bunch of chopped cilantro.  It's kinda great and it looks like tabbouleh but has other flavors. So I  decide to add tabbouleh type things to it: a little chopped red pepper ((quarter of a bell pepper) and about 6 cherry tomatoes destined for the salad. I  squeeze a lime over it and stir it up. Add a little more black pepper. It's seriously the best I've had and I'm not that into the grain myself. I just do it to fit in with all my hippie neighbors.  tldr: Use triple the amount of fat you usually do and double the salt."
MealPrepSunday,3e2o66,esper2142,7,Tue Jul 21 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"According to my food scientist uncle who helped develop food for astronauts most home made cooked dishes last 7 days in the fridge. Adding things like avocado or sour cream etc will change that to shorter but most standard rice and beans or soups or other dishes he says have a 7 day shelf life in fridges when sealed and stored properly.   I'd say across the board he's been right from my anecdotal experience. Enchiladas, meatloaf, pasta dishes, etc all seemed to last well enough.   The things that don't are usually pre prepared foods. (Or deli potato salad usually doesn't keep a week but that's because it may have been made a few days prior already)  I never eat fish or shrimp etc unless it's made fresh. But everything else meat or vegetarian I have no problem with eating leftovers.   Plus most things that don't have fresh veggies or fruits in them will freeze beautifully."

For example, when I make soup, my SO just puts it away in the pot (with lid). I've been insisting that we use airtight containers but don't have anything concrete to support this."
MealPrepSunday,3e2o66,tina_ri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:01 2015 UTC,Air flow even in the fridge is an invitation for bacteria. Veggies need airflow because they were living much like cut flowers still need water.   If your lid can create a seal or there is no lip on your pan then it should be fine. Over time some metal may leach into your food so like no cast iron with acidic foods (tomatoes)  because that can potentially make you sick.   Stainless steel is actually ok but all the others I'd say better to grab glass to store it in.   Also make sure the pot of food it thoroughly cooked so your fridge temp doesn't drop too.
MealPrepSunday,3e2o66,Kingjakers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"Also make sure the pot of food it thoroughly cooked so your fridge temp doesn't drop too.   I have it on fair authority that this isn't exactly the case.   Question: Can I put hot food in the refrigerator?  Answer: It’s fine to place hot food directly in the refrigerator.  Don’t worry about overheating the fridge — as the U.S. Department of Agriculture points out, the refrigerator’s thermostat will keep it running to maintain a safe temperature of 40° F or below.  What you do need to worry about is whether the hot food will cool off quickly enough to reach a safe temperature once it’s in the refrigerator. So never put deep containers of hot food in the refrigerator — instead, place the hot food in shallow containers so it will chill quickly.   via Still Tasty/US Dept of Agriculture"
MealPrepSunday,3e2o66,filthgrinder,2,Tue Jul 21 23:38:56 2015 UTC,I had thought this an issue in the past but like idgelee said food keeps for longer than you think. 5-6 days should be easy for most meals you would cook in your home provided they don't possess any elements that are prone to quick spoiling. Just keep it refrigerated.
MealPrepSunday,3e2o66,spidermilk666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:54 2015 UTC,Just buy some good airtight containers to have your food in and everything will hold for 5-7 days.

If I accidentally make too much pasta or soup I throw it in the freezer since they freeze well.  Fish, chicken, beef, pork, stir fry, whatever- 7 days in my fridge. The only thing that might not last that long is bread (store bought but especially homemade) so I just freeze what I can't eat in a few days since it thaws quickly."
MealPrepSunday,3e1k8h,Kingdom_of_the_Skies,44,Tue Jul 21 06:31:00 2015 UTC,Just bring a whole avacado with you and slice it up before eating. It will turn brown shortly after cutting it like this

MealPrepSunday,3e1k8h,krankie,13,Tue Jul 21 14:26:50 2015 UTC,I've had luck saving a half (with the rind on) for a day or two by taking some lemon juice and rubbing it on the cut flesh and then putting some cling wrap pressed against the flesh and then twisted up in the back.

It worked great for me and didn't alter the flavor like citrus can! Although I still wouldn't recommend trying to do this for more than a couple of days in advance, it could definitely be done for slicing up half the avocado for day 1, and using the rest on day 2 or day 3."

MealPrepSunday,3e1k8h,Chummers5,8,Tue Jul 21 11:24:33 2015 UTC,Are you prepping the avocado ahead of time? It tends to go brown pretty quickly. You could try putting some citrus juice on it.

Furikake is a Japanese seasoning (salt, sesame seed, nori) that is really flavorful and easy to make at home (I used seaweed chips instead of buying a whole sheet of nori). Cooking rice with broth or curry paste is another choice.   My thoughts on avocados."

MealPrepSunday,3e1k8h,frenchballoon,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:24 2015 UTC,I used this one as an idea. I didn't have bonito flakes (dried fish flakes) and didn't add sugar. I used these (found them on clearance; not good by themselves) as the nori/seaweed. It was good but almost too salty since I didn't consider the seasoning from the seaweed chips. I put about a TBS on 1 cup of rice when I portioned it out.   Budget Bytes also has some good ideas for rice if you're looking for variety.

MealPrepSunday,3dy81q,natrixgli,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Aha!   If you seperate your meat and throw in a teaspoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of balsamic vinaigrette, it microwaves up so fucking juicy and tender. You can also just use the vinaigrette but it can be overpowering to taste depending on your preferences.   I do it all the time with steak cooked just like yours.   Add it to your container just before refrigerating.   Also, a splash of water for your chicken makes reheating actually worth it."
MealPrepSunday,3dy81q,Citizen01123,4,Tue Jul 21 00:33:56 2015 UTC,The best way I've found to reheat steak is to just put hot food on top of it; this warms it through without re-cooking it.
MealPrepSunday,3dy81q,FeistyRaccoon,3,Mon Jul 20 21:50:02 2015 UTC,Another option is to nuke a bowl of water for a couple minutes. Toss the steak in a plastic bag and immerse in the well heated (but not super hot) water for a few minutes.
MealPrepSunday,3dy81q,PROFANITY_IS_BAD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:24 2015 UTC,I think steak maintains the best consistency and flavor if it's heated on the stove top for a minute or two.

Toss in rose marry and flip the chicken breast once the under side is golden. Sear all edges to golden brown, then place into an oven safe dish. Add 1 cup of your chicken stock into the dish with the chicken, if you like roasted onions and your diet allows, chuck in an onion (halved) with the skins on. Bring your stock back to a boil as well as a sauce pan with a cup of water. Roast the chicken breast in the oven for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken then roast for another 10 minutes. If you have a meat thermometer, check the temperature (if it reads 165F it's cooked).   After flipping the chicken, add 1/2 cup of green beans (or broccoli) to the saucepan of boiling water. Add 1/2 cup of brown rice to your boiling chicken stock If you're not worried about sodium, season the water/stock with garlic salt. If you have a steamer, it'd be healthier to just steam the vegetables, and if you have a rice cooker it'd be easier to just chuck the stock and rice into the cooker and press the button.  Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven. If your chicken has cooked before your rice, then cover with foil and let it rest until your rice has finished. If the rice/vegetables cook before the chicken, just keep the heat low to keep them warm.  Slice the chicken and onion (if added). Add the rice/vegetables. Pour the sauce over it.  Serve.  Edit: If doing for a meal prep, this meal can be frozen for up to 1 month and refrigerated for 3 days.  Edit2: Use the calculator in my previous comment to estimate how much sauce/seasoning to use for the entire dish, separate them and just use from that pool so you know exactly how much is going in. Remember to base it off your servings. Standard Serving for chicken breast is 3 - 6 oz or 100 - 200g. So if you're cooking 3 servings use 3x more seasoning :)"

I would've have not known where to begin if it wasn't for your encouragement and inspirational posts, cheers!! Links and extra details below.  Sweet Spicy Chicken Bowls  I ended up multiplying this recipe arbitrarily by 3 and it was literally the perfect portions across the board. From the beans, to the chicken, to the rice nothing was wasted or left over.  Avocado Lime Greek Yogurt Dressing  Used the suggested recipe of 1 cup yogurt to 1 avocado. Had about 1/4 cup left after all 10 meals.  3 compartment Bento Boxes $10 on Prime Day woo!  My rice cooker, $95 on Prime Day  This rice cooker is incredible. Just set and forget it, made 3 cups on brown rice cooked in chicken broth to perfection. Keeps warm and fresh for hours on end!  Edit: People asking how I heat up. I eat the granola and yogurt or the salad first then heat the rest up. And the yogurt is not affected by the other flavors due to the nice seals on the 3 compartments :)"

MealPrepSunday,3dyn4h,land_stander,2,Mon Jul 20 18:23:12 2015 UTC,How does the avocado hold up in the fridge? I put some on my salads every day but it starts to brown after a day. I generally cut up half an avocado every other day. I've heard lemon will help prevent that but I've heard 8t doesn't help as well.

MealPrepSunday,3dw9y8,pnwgirl,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:10 2015 UTC,Ditto this.
MealPrepSunday,3dw9y8,k_jo_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Basically what you see there. I sautee the beef with ~2-3 tbsp of soy, ~1 tbsp of chili oil, dash of sesame oil, minced garlic (ideally fresh), ground ginger (prefer fresh, but I usually have a shaker on hand), chili flakes, and sesame seeds. I was thinking about adding mirin as well, but I have yet to experiment.   I try to use very little of the above ingredients because of the high sodium and fat content. However, if someone could answer me this, how much of the sauce gets absorbed by the beef? I feel like there's a lot left over in the pan when I drain the beef. I'm honestly just winging it."
MealPrepSunday,3dw9y8,pnwgirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"Do you drain off the grease after you brown the beef? I think if you used a lower fat ground beef you would have less ""sauce."" Sounds delicious though."

MealPrepSunday,3dw9y8,MsChicagoAccountant,2,Mon Jul 20 10:35:57 2015 UTC,In my experience it only dries if it stays in an open container in the fridge. The microwave doesn't remove a noticeable amount of water.

MealPrepSunday,3dw9y8,k_jo_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok, well I think that would be fine, but I would definitely put them in a plastic bag.  That is what I always carry mine in anyway.    What I might suggest instead, is this  I would take one of these, maybe two and use them for lunch all week.  Have one cleaned every night, and the other loaded up with what you want to eat the next day.  You'd never have to worry about using plasticware at work, and would feel fairly safe that it wouldn't spill.  The other one I would suggest is this it is a little big, but I have always liked the way they looked.  You could place this standing up right in your backpack, and have your books or whatever else on the other side.  Anyway, just look for bento box on Amazon.  That is a link to the search, no referral or anything, but jut making it as easy as possible.  I really love bento boxes, but I don't make them pretty, I just make them to eat.  I'm not an artist, I am just a hungry dude who wants to have an easy way to carry his food to and from work."

Overall the food turned out very well and some of the noodle cups have gone into regular rotation on my menus. However, one tip: Better than Boullion (a soup base mentioned in the article) is quite salty so use with caution. I like Knorr Homestyle Stock better(bonus: is cheaper than Better than Boullion - here is a link: http://www.knorr.ca/product/category/258268/knorr-homestyle-stock-and-broth?gclid=CM_QhafV6cYCFQataQod4VAPtg&gclsrc=aw.ds).

Like bullion, you just add water to get broth, but it's tastier and, well, better. You can buy it at the grocery store next to where all the regular bullion cubes are, then after you open it you store the jar in the fridge."

Drain the turkey fat and let cool. Cut bell peppers in half and boil for 10 minutes before draining water and allowing to cool. Preheat oven to 350, stuff soft(ish) peppers with ground turkey (used 4 peppers) and then sprinkle with low-fat mozz cheese and a little siracha.   *(3) Butterfly boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pound even thickness. Season with Old Bay, Mrs. Dash, & Weber Garlic Herb Seasoning.  Grill on high heat, let cool, then cut into small strips. Weigh into 6 oz. portions with veggies of your choice.   *(4) Go to smoothie every morning: 1 scoop of ON Whey, 6 oz. of Egg Beaters, 2 oz. 2% milk, 70g of strawberries, 70g blueberries, half cup of drained frozen spinach, tablespoon of espresso grounds, and 1 cup of greek yogurt.

I enjoy it a lot because I feel like it holds up AMAZING in dishes (especially this salad type dish - it stays in my fridge all week and tastes just as fresh on Saturday as it did on Monday), has a good deal of protein, and it tastes super hearty and keeps me full for a great deal of time.   I'm not really into the gluten free fad, but if you have celiacs disease or any other kind of sensitivity to gluten this is a great alternative because it's technically a seed even though it gets lumped in with other grains."

Do your cardio exercise before eating breakfast.  Garden Salad, no dressing. Put them into mason jars in the fridge on sunday and you've got an easy side dish. If you can replace lettuce with spinach then it will be more healthy for you and you'll get more protein. Leafy Greens, Cherry Tomato, Cucumber, Raw Red Onions, Beatroot, Carrot shavings. Squeaze of lemon juice before eating or vinegar will give you some acidity.  Stay away from too much carbs, sodium, fats, and sugars. Good main meals would include fish + rice or salad. Chicken breast wrapped a tortilla with the salad aforementioned. Try to avoid pasta, potato, fried stuff, oil based products, and lots of salt/sugar.  Honestly I find rice to be some of the best things out there because it's filling and not terribly unhealthy for you.  Once you start getting the hang of things, just swap out the salad every now and again with your own vegetables... just try to remember that as with anything, using an ingredient's natural flavors can often substitute flavors that you would otherwise get from unhealthy condiments.  Edit:  Finally, treat yourself with one meal a week.. maybe on a weekend where you get something healthy and homecooked, but with more flavor to it than you would otherwise add."

Dump ice and cold water into the pot over the eggs. Allow to cool to room temp or cooler before peeling. On average I lose 1 egg per dozen with this method."

As for the protein, people who work out regularly usually say to at least try to match the grams of protein to your weight in pounds--so 102 pounds, 102 grams of protein. Those levels aren't really necessary if you're not trying to put on muscle, but some studies say that eating more protein while losing weight helps to preserve muscle a bit.

I can't do broccoli unless it's steamed with lemon juice or recently I discovered roasted vegetables. My life was changed.   Easy prep because you use aluminum foil on a cookie sheet. Spray with no stick spray. Spread fresh chopped broccoli on the pan and spray with a bit more non stick then toss with some season salt or salt, pepper, garlic.  450 for about 10-25 minutes depending on how small your pieces are and remove when edges are looking brown. I served by itself or lightly add some siracha depending on my mood.   I hated broccoli before trying this. But now I will try any roasted veggie.   Try different things. Fresh veggies are fairly cheap and add great bulk with low calories to meals. It's worth it to broaden your choices by trying different preparations than what you are used to."

Same rules but cook until the potatoes have that crunchy brown golden deliciousness. Way better than French fries imo.   Throw broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots in there and it's like a party. Fastest dinner ever with cheese cubes on the side for protein and way healthier than boxed shit. Cleanup is as easy as washing a knife/cutting board and throwing away aluminum foil too.   Get fancy and do roasted carrots with a bit of balsamic vinegar.   Roasted squash and zucchini are good but not my favorite. Might be your thing.   Roasted fresh green beans or Brussel sprouts are seriously stupid good. And I hate Brussel sprouts.   Roasted with onion or garlic for some good aromatics. And do all of them and toss with rice. Yum!!!!   You could probably make some stupid good burritos or wraps that might freeze well. Homemade food is always a better option than store bought imo.   My grocery store has a pre chopped/prepped veggie section in their produce & deli department. They will make mixes ready for the oven or stir fry that are so easy and worth it. (Rosemary potatoes or squash and broccoli and carrots and cabbage) For convenience that helped because then prep is just as fast as freezer section meals.   I don't mind paying extra for that stuff because it won't go bad in the fridge because it's ready to go.   Plus the more you try the more you might discover you aren't limited. ;)"

I've made avocado pasta, spinach tomato tortellini, pizza from scratch... actually, I guess it's more of what I usually make, only fancier and with more ingredients xD  A slow cooker doesn't sound necessarily yummy to me but I always see it highly recommended. I figured maybe I could make some soup. I have canned soup I never really eat, but if I put work into making it, maybe I'll eat it. And maybe it will be yummier?"
MealPrepSunday,3dumgm,ImOxygenPotassium,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:30 2015 UTC,"One thing I would recommend, after you get the routine down of eating 3 meals a day, is to start incorporating the foods you are picky about or don't like into meals you have already successfully cooked and enjoy. For example, I love stir-fry and I hate mushrooms. The texture is just wrong for me. But, if I put it in the stir-fry with my other veggies (broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, carrot etc.) I like it. One that note, stir fry is amazing, you can do Asian noodles instead of rice and the veggies are really easy to cook. Its always slightly different every time you make it (just change up the sauces) and it will last through a whole week as a meal prep/leftovers."
MealPrepSunday,3dumgm,maddata,4,Mon Jul 20 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"I know this is going to sound super shitty, but I believe it truly needs to be said.    Stop being so picky.    If you really want to meal prep and eat more healthy, then you're going to have to change a lot of things, starting with your ideas and attitudes about food itself.    I was the same way for a long time but now I'm realizing that the only way to create long term healthiness in the food I eat is to change the core ways in which I see/think about/interact with food.  Best of luck to you!  EDIT: depending on the tools you have available to you as a college student (I'm guessing not a lot if in a dorm, etc.) your best bet is to find fresh fruits and veggies you can just keep fresh with a mini fridge for snacks.  Use those as fillers for your normal meals.  You can get certain fruits and veggies affordably if you do some research.    Another possibility is to cut out a meal (depending on your goals) and replace with a protein shake of some kind.   I prep mine every weekend for the entire week and that's my lunch.  Between that and several healthy snacks throughout the day, I always feel full and I'm brining in a slightly lower calorie count than I need everyday to lose a few pounds.  These are cheap to make in bulk."
MealPrepSunday,3dumgm,idgelee,5,Sun Jul 19 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"Since OP said they have trouble eating 3 meals, I think we should take them at their word and help them with the more urgent issue. Yeah, it's always nice when people have fewer hangups, but I suspect that if it were as easy as willing yourself to be different, OP wouldn't have a problem at the moment."
MealPrepSunday,3dumgm,maddata,3,Sun Jul 19 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is very much the truth. I'm pretty aware of how unideal my eating is, which is why I'm working on steps to help myself. I really am wanting to tackle the issue, but I'm my own worst enemy!   I had never heard of the ""meal prep"" idea until the nutritionist suggested it. It sounds great for me. If I have everything prepared for the week, I have less excuses to skip.  You're right, I have hangups, so I'm trying to work around them and maybe then I can get through them one at a time :)"
MealPrepSunday,3dskmh,hopeless93,10,Sun Jul 19 01:25:35 2015 UTC,"First my recommendations for storage:   Lunch box Bowls Containers   I would also recommend a food scale. I love mine and in conjunction with MyFitnessPal's database I can whip up accurate nutritional info.  There was a pretty successful post recently that instead of prepping meals the user prepped their ingredients. This might be something you could look into if you don't know what meals you want to eat during the week, but know what ingredients you want to use.  Vegetable noodles are really good replacements for pasta noodles. I am fond of spaghetti squash, but some swear by zucchini.  You can take a look at my post history for some of the meals I've done. I've been trying something new every week."

MealPrepSunday,3dskmh,k0m0rebi,4,Mon Jul 20 04:20:40 2015 UTC,I prefer www.skinnytaste.com for most healthy recipes. She has calories listed etc and she also has a great cookbook.   Look into your macronutrients to make sure you are hitting the right amounts of the right food. Nourishing your body is honestly a huge priority and will make you feel satisfied faster.   Keep it simple and fresh and close to the core of what food is. The further from processed food you get the more satisfied you will feel from real food and the easier it is to feel healthy.   Just my experience. Figure out if you are ok eating the same thing every day or if you need variety. Test out one week and then see what worked and then change it. Keeping a food journal and a mood journal and track what kept you full and what didn't will help especially at the beginning.   Also I recommend /r/xxfitness/ strongly. They are a great and supportive community. I would post there if you have health or fitness questions as they are a knowledgable and varied bunch of ladies. Plus they have an awesome FAQ that will drill down and give you some epic pointers.

There are tons of recipes online but I just cook tri bells until soft then add them, eggs, tater tots, black beans with chili or jalapeños, and some kind of meat like steak or bacon or sausage.   My family loves these squash burritos. Sometimes I add eggs to this.

I usually put one in the fridge before I go to bed and reheat in the morning one minute then turn over and do another minute but it's almost too hot.   The best thing is you can customize it any way you want. But write on the foil what each one is if you are having a variety

One of the tricks I've found that helps them keep longer is to first let them cool to room temperate after you put them in tupperware. Then wipe off the condinsation from the inside of the lid. Place in the refrigerator for about an hour then take them out and wipe away the excess water again before you place them in the freezer.   In the morning when I put them in my lunch box I then move one of the frozen tupperware dishes into the refrigerator to thaw."

Once it's hit a boil, turn off hear and Add ice cubes to the water (so when you pour it over the chicken it doesn't cook it). Once it's cool, poor the mixture over the chicken. Add enough water to cover the rest of chicken. Add in a BUNCH of poultry seasoning on top. I just sprinkle a ton on it. (Seriously a ton) Let sit over night in the fridge. Before you cook it, take it out of the bucket, and coat it with butter. Cook breast side down for an hour, then flip it over and continue cooking it breast side up. Baste it often.

MealPrepSunday,3dotsz,KMilliron,15,Sat Jul 18 01:01:01 2015 UTC,"Hopefully some other folks will comment who are more experienced with this than I am, but here goes:  First, questions. What's the money situation? Aside from fridge/freezer stuff, do we need to take into account budgeting for meals, are most ingredients on the table? If your refrigeration is limited, is your cooking equipment? At home do you have a full stove and oven, or anything like a rice cooker or crock pot?   Assuming we're working with a full kitchen...  I'd suggest burritos with meat (I'm partial to chicken), beans, and rice. You'll get carbs and protein, and they're easy to store, carry, heat, etc. A jar of salsa, can of black beans, bag of white rice, tortillas, some meat and you're in business. Add some cheese if you like. Also easy to add veg such as onion, peppers, and the like. I like to sneak in things like carrot and spinach too. You could make a zesty coleslaw as a side too! (I'm kind of obsessed with cabbage lately).   I'm obsessed with mini crustless quiches/egg muffins lately. So easy and tasty. Imagine the makings of your favorite omelette, but in muffin form. Super easy to eat on the go.   Stir fry. You can make a big batch and throw it in tupperware. Just a few minutes in the microwave and you're in business. You could do shrimp, chicken, egg, and various veggies so that the flavors are diverse enough you don't get bored too quickly.   All of these you can sneak veggies into as well for bulk and you know, health. I love grating (think box grater) veggies into things- they cook down, add flavor without taking away from a sauce or overall flavor profile, and you get in your veggies! Carrots, squash (zucchini and yellow especially), garlic, onion (although probably better to dice) all work really well for this. Beets, cabbage, and brussel sprouts can too sometimes, depending.   Pasta is always a easy and tasty option, but I don't want you getting too full and tired on the job. Maybe an orzo or tortellini salad with a light dressing and lots of veggies and protein?   Sometimes it helps me to think casserole style. I hate doing dishes, and am generally a fairly lazy cook, so the closer I get to a one-pot meal the better. I've made random dishes of chicken, quinoa, spinach, onion, garlic, and cheese, or quinoa, beets, avocado, feta, and spinach. Throw it in a tupperware like it's a side salad, and you have a meal you can throw down your gullet easy. If quinoa isn't your thing, brown rice works in a lot of these situations too. I will also make burritos of non-Mexican food I enjoy. Curry chicken and rice? Check. Chicken cooked in marinara with feta cheese and spinach? Check. You could make a leftover stir fry burrito! The plus of these are easy, hand-held foods and freezer-friendly."
MealPrepSunday,3dotsz,MyNameIs_Bubbles,7,Sat Jul 18 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, with the overtime I'm making and how cheap my rent is, budgeting isn't too much of an issue. My cooking space is sparse, but I use a walk in closet near the main living area to hold all of my cooking supplies. Stir fry = life. Never thought of grating my veggies, though. I love the taste of my vegetables, but not so much the texture of big chunks, so that would be an awesome addition."

MealPrepSunday,3dotsz,Citizen01123,5,Sat Jul 18 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"Burritos are great. Simply rice and beans is enough to get you through the day, but you want to enjoy it. There are a dozen or so leafy greens that are great with burritos, my favorite is spinach. Load it on. Rice is best if you season the water while it's boiling. Most beans work well. I'm a big fan of chicken but pork and beef work perfectly well. Tomatoes, olives, pickles, cabbages, and other veggies are all great on burritos, but keep in mind that they'll have to survive being reheated. The dressing is a big part of the equation. Are you going to go with good old fashioned seasoned meats and rice, or do you want to play around? Hot sauces, ranches, vinegarettes, guacamoles, salsas, fresh pico de gayo, and so on. How you season your beef strips, ground beef, chicken strips or cutlets, porn cutlets or ground pork should be complemented by what you season your rice with, as well as your dressing/condiment. Wrap them in foil and freeze. Play around with different greens and dressings. Making burritos is great because with about $20 you can make 12-15 protein bombs that are easy to store, take and reheat. Plus, they're fun to make!  Casserole dishes offer the warmth that you'll be craving in a few months. Noodle varieties, creams, meats, cheese, and toppings. That's it, plus veggies to mix in or on the side. With a casserole, prep is everything because the oven does all the work for you. By and large, the ratio of liquid to pasta and filler is key. You don't want a soupy casserole. Use different cheeses and adding crusts on top can liven it up a bit. You can top them off with seasoned crumbs, crunched up Ritz crackers or Cheez-Itz. Casseroles are easy to portion and feel good in the belly. Cheese is your friend here.  Pasta dishes are great because they allow you to experiment with sauces, herbs and spices, and they go with veggies and bread so well it's dumb. They also have the added benefit of always being ready to have something new added. One day you have pasta and meatballs with a salad, then you have the basic pasta with steamed veggies and garlic bread, then you can have pasta and chicken. You can also add a little something extra to the sauce after the initial seasonings, so bring out more basil or more onion. Brown up your ground meats and let it simmer in the sauce. Mmmm!  Also, I'm a big fan of macaroni and cheese and I can make a good meal of it. But, first things first: cut out the Kraft, Velveeta, Chef Boyardee junk. If you don't make it yourself, at least use better powdered cheeses. Annie's, Newman's Own, Back to Nature, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Dave's Marketplace (if you live in RI) are all much better tasting and if you only buy them on sale you're only spending a quarter or so more than a boz of Krap Cheeziest. Even better, buy them on Amazon they're much cheaper. Basically, I brown up a bunch of onions and garlic, cook a bunch of spinach, and cook up some meats. The meats can either be seasoned and cooked yourself or store bought. I really like Newman's Own, Aidel's, Brat Hans, and other brands from the same stores. Chicken, beef and pork sausages, meatballs and brats. They're easy to cook up in a pan with oil and slice up. Throw all your ingredients into the macaroni and cheese, stir them together and you've got yourself one hell of a quickly prepped mac and cheese meal. For bonus flavor, grate a bunch of fresh parmesan or romano cheese on top for extra gooeyness.  If I make eggs for a few days, I prefer either hard boiled with some sea salt (table salt is junk) or I like to make little quiches (as mentioned elsewhere) or throw them into a muffin tin and make little bird nests. Just eggs works but you can throw all the omelette stuff you like in there, plus you can grate potatoes on the bottom throw the eggs and veggies in next and slam the top with bacon, sausage, tomato or more potatoes! Recommend reheating eggs in a toaster oven rather than a microwave though.  If you're looking for food ideas, I do recommend signing up for Pinterest. For something like food ideas you can easily organize and compartmentalize any dish or meal you want in any way. Boards for budgets, planning ahead, mini meals, main dishes, side dishes, meats, veggies, salads, desserts, treats, pastas, casseroles, breakfasts, ovens, stove tops, no cooking, grilling, crock pots. You name it, you can find a slew of recipes and ideas there."

Obviously wouldn't suggest you have a diet of just those, but keep a couple around for quick eating when you need a little extra.  I second the mini crustless quiches. They taste good even cold to me if you don't want to waste precious break time microwaving.   Last week I slowcooked some pork and shredded it with some bbq sauce. Scooped some into a little container and sent some of that with my SO to work a few days with a fresh bun in a ziplock bag. It is still a sandwich, but not exactly deli meat and cheese style.

As a dude with a little meat on his bones, just the idea of eating only 1300 calories a day makes me hungry.  Also, a friend of mine does the same thing with blueberries and watermelon, and throws a little chopped mint in. I was skeptical at first, but it's surprisingly delicious and refreshing."

I have also done this recipe with extra firm tofu, its just as tasty, but I put it in for less time. I'm sure you could use another substitute, or more veggies & lentils (sweet potato, squash, chickpeas)   I bulk up on crazy amounts of vegetables. The chili recipe is also low calorie/ high protein, so if you don't put it into the burrito, it alone is insanely filling and low on calories, even put a poached or fried egg on top. SO good.   I have a bunch of low calorie/ vegetarian recipes. Here's another good one: Vegan Pho"

MealPrepSunday,3dk1fw,mysilverlinings,3,Fri Jul 17 02:05:54 2015 UTC,"Burritos are kept in the freezer. I just unwrap them and heat them up for 3 minutes in my microwave. They're good to go.   For the sprouts/beans I didn't cook them too much, just cause they cook more when I re-heat.   I do eat the veg/salad dish cold. Most people would probably hate that, because there is cheese on top, but I don't mind it. You can always put them in separate containers and microwave the vegetable dish :)"

MealPrepSunday,3dexev,AnnoyingAxolotl,5,Wed Jul 15 21:57:10 2015 UTC,"I think the reason people like them is that you can have three different foods in a single container and they won't get mixed together.

Sprinkled a tiny bit of thyme inside and out, and lemon pepper and salt on the outside.  I put a dutch oven over not-quite-medium heat, lubed with a bit of bacon fat, and browned the skin for about 4 minutes each side.  I left it breast side down in the pan.  Threw a couple more celery stalks in because I was too lazy to re-wrap them and put them back in the fridge, diced the rest of the onion and threw that in the pan too, then slapped the lid down and put it in the oven at 400F until I got a reading of 160F in the thigh.  I let it rest with the cover on for about 5 minutes, then on the carving board until I was ready to serve.  I chucked all the celery and big onion chunks but put the garlic back in the pan.  The pan had quite a lot of juices in it so I reduced it some over medium-high heat on the oven before adding some heavy whipping cream.  Further reduced it to a nice thin gravy, finished with a pat of butter and some pepper.  It wasn't greasy at all even though I didn't separate the fat first because keto."

MealPrepSunday,3dc5sj,FranzJosephWannabe,6,Wed Jul 15 03:17:42 2015 UTC,"I made these a few years ago as I have the book that this recipe is derived from.  I think if you're going to add veg that needs cooking you're best parboiling it first (same goes for your noodles, if they're not ready to eat).  I found that no matter how thin my carrot slices were (used a peeler) they were always a bit undercooked after just a few mins sat in what was once boiling water.  IMO you want a meal that just needs warming, not cooking, as the water quickly loses temperature, especially in a glass mason jar."

Do you put them on a microwaveable plate to heat up and eat when you're ready to eat them?   I'm sorry to ask so many dumb questions. :(

MealPrepSunday,3dalom,dlaxman31,7,Tue Jul 14 20:04:43 2015 UTC,You should pound the chicken breasts flat before cooking them. Helps them cook more evenly and not get dried out.
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,Pappy091,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:15 2015 UTC,"Also brining does wonders.  Little bit more work, but I've found its so worth it in the long run.  Chicken usually stays juicy the whole week and carries a lot more flavor."
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,_CW,3,Wed Jul 15 00:01:51 2015 UTC,How do you brine?
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,The12thDimension,5,Wed Jul 15 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry!  I should've included that!  Brining is actually extremely easy.  There are plenty of methods people swear by but I don't measure or do anything special.    Essentially, all you need to do is soak the chicken in a bowl of water overnight (I usually go a minimum of 12 hours).  Before putting the chicken in the water put in plenty of salt.  I usually do about a 1/4 cup for every pound of chicken.  I also use garlic and a few other stronger spices.  Mix all of that in the water and then dump the chicken in and let it sit overnight in the fridge (covered).    Don't rinse but pat dry and cook.  Brining is just soaking in salt water pretty much.  I've found it adds so much to chicken that I almost refuse to cook chicken now without brining it first."
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,_CW,2,Wed Jul 15 02:39:28 2015 UTC,Do you pound it before or after brining?

MealPrepSunday,3dalom,_CW,2,Wed Jul 15 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"I always put sugar in my brine. I make the sugar/salt mixture, and bring hot (not boiling) water almost to the saturation point.  You can always add more water if you add too much, don't be shy.  It should taste a sweet. Maybe even use 2 parts sugar for every 3 parts water."
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,muffintopmusic,2,Wed Jul 15 03:32:43 2015 UTC,Interesting concept. I'll give this a try next time.

MealPrepSunday,3dalom,troymccluresf,0,Wed Jul 15 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"How are you reheating? In the microwave? This will dry it out even more sadly. I use a steamer when I warm up my food, but if you don't have access to warm it up add some water to it. It's a bit tricky to find how much water you will need but it will rehydrate the meat. This is why I meal prep for just one day of food. It may be a little inconvenient but it sure as hell makes the food more palatable."
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,mynameissam182,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately. That's the only appliance we have here at work. What about brining as someone mentioned elsewhere?"
MealPrepSunday,3dalom,troymccluresf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:40 2015 UTC,I've never done that people. Sounds almost like you would be pickling the chicken though. I mean salt water will keep it fresh and hydrated but it would be very salty.

MealPrepSunday,3dcvhl,WUN_WUN_SMASH,5,Wed Jul 15 09:35:18 2015 UTC,"Going veg (even if only for one meal) actually opens up lots of options, but you have to be willing to exercise them, otherwise you're just gnawing on a bag of carrots. Make two or three recipes every week and portion everything into half portions, that way you can mix and match to keep things interesting.   Bell peppers and hummus are a delicious combination, and can be the basis for a large variety of sandwiches/wraps/salads/sides/snacks. You can make veggie soups/stews that are bulked out with beans/lentils/peas/chickpeas rather than meat. As a bonus, it freezes well and you can dish it into portions and have soup twice a week for months. Also, if you make rice and beans, you can sneak some lard/chicken stock into it, and no one will be the wiser. bean salad is really easy to do. It's surprising how well a little tabbouleh and some cherry tomatoes can dress up canned beans. Pasta salad with pesto. If you don't want to make your own pesto, you can buy jarred. Or your deli counter might have it."

MealPrepSunday,3dcvhl,something_obscure,3,Sun Jul 19 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"Do you have a press grill like a George Foreman?  If so you can make awesome tofu sandwiches.  Just get the firmest tofu you can find, slice it into 3 or 4 slabs, marinade it in soy sauce for half an hour or so then grill it for like 30-40 minutes until browned and firm.  You can also take it off the grill at this point, toss in another sauce of your choice (like BBQ) and bake it at 350 for 15 minutes or so.  But don't try to grill it in any sort of sauce with sugar in it.  The sugar will scorch long before your tofu firms up the way you want it.    Hummus is classic.  It makes good sandwiches, too.  It's not just a dip.  And you can make hummus out of just about any bean for variety.  Chickpea is classic, of course, and black bean gets a lot of play but I've been happy with hummus made out of cannelini, butter beans and even corn.    Veggie burgers are dead simple and I like them just fine cold.  The basic formula is mashed beans, starch (like oats or bread crumbs) and binding agent (like eggs).  The rest is just spices.    Vegetarian chili is easy and delicious.    TVP tacos are tough to beat.  Just rehydrate in water then treat like ground beef when making tacos.  (You'll have to add some fat to the pan, though, since TVP doesn't have any on its own).  Egg salad.    Grilled cheese.  Rice & beans.  Edit: Clarity"
MealPrepSunday,3dcvhl,idgelee,5,Wed Jul 15 19:29:00 2015 UTC,"I would do soups - hard to tell you have used chicken or beef stock in those.   I would also go for salads that are varied and balanced (beans, corn, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, broccoli, cheese, avocado etc) so I don't really notice the lack of meat.   Are hard boiled eggs an option?  I would also make a bunch of pasta/marinara sauce dishes. I'm passive aggressive enough to hide meat in it but you likely enjoy your job enough to change your diet.   I'd also look at packing a cooler and just eating lunches ""off campus"" so I wouldn't have to follow the rules. Plus getting away from the office is actually good for you I hear."

And in this case, it is the freedom of the ones who cut the checks to call the tune, not the ones seeking said checks.    It's legal because although it is discriminatory, it involves no protected classes (e.g. gender, sexuality, race, etc.)    If it is not a protected class (and what you eat, for non-religious reasons, is not protected)  employers are free to fire someone for any, or no, reason.  They can fire you simply because they don't like you, for some undefined reason.   Now, if they fire you because you are black, that's illegal.  But if they simply because they think you're goofy, and don't want you around, or think yiou eat foul food, you're history."

Barbecue sauce in one container, Szechuan sauce in another, gravy in another, and soy sauce + lemon juice in another.   Another idea is to do a Chipotle copycat.

For example you could do a red seafood pasta one day, then a white sauce with mushrooms, then a pesto sauce with chicken, then a pasta salad, etc.   Or rice. Start with a short grain sushi rice. Cook it down with stock, white wine, cheese, and cream to make risotto (remember to mix in some extra stock while reheating in microwave). Make sushi or sear some ahi tuna to eat over it. Eat it with chicken. Eat it with mapo tofu. Fry it up with egg, onions, and pork. Try rice porridge out--reheat some with little bits beef jerky in in, the jerky reconstitutes into stew meat.  Also, make sure you accurate evaluate the portions you need before you cook, so there are fewer leftovers you won't touch."

Here's a spreadsheet from the comment section of that link to help with water temperatures.  Put each serving in a different bag, and add different seasonings to each bag. You can have 2 different coolers going, or just cook stuff with similar cooking temperatures. I would probably do pork/chicken the same week, and beef/lamb the same week.   Steam a couple different types of veggies. Sautee a couple vegetables.. Cook a pot of rice, par cook some pasta, and/or bake potatoes for your carbs.   It will be a little more work, but you should be able to eat something different every day. I'm gonna start doing MPS soon.

If the germs are dead and then the food is placed in an environment that is shown to restrict bacteria growth, such as the fridge, I don't see a problem.    However, this link says otherwise. I'm not sure if they recommend this because they are overly cautious or what.    Maybe we can go to one of the science subs and ask?"

MealPrepSunday,3dctp9,ObsidianOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:24:23 2015 UTC,I work in the food industry and safety rule is to reheat foods completely to 165°f and have the temp hold for at least 15 seconds.
MealPrepSunday,3d9z5q,jillianjo,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you don't want to, but you could try making casseroles or dishes with the protein/vegetables/carbs mixed together. Alternatively you could try to find small disposable metal baking dishes that you could fit inside a larger glass container, then remove from the oven one at a time.  You could try making collard greens or southern style green beans, as you have to cook the shit out of those to begin with. Or just eat raw vegetables."
MealPrepSunday,3d9z5q,dimeadozen09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"So thinking about it you may want to just reheat things separate. Meat in first, starches potentially second, and then the veggies at the end. Or cook veggies from raw.   Roasted broccoli is stupid easy. Take a pan and throw the broccoli in. Fresh broccoli that's chopped into reasonable bite size pieces. Toss with a bit of olive oil or non stick spray then add garlic, salt, pepper. Cook in middle of oven on 425 for about 15 minutes (you want brown crispy edges). Make sure the broccoli is spread out and has a bit of space to breathe but otherwise this works on a cookie sheet or in a loaf pan as long as you single layer.   Really you can roast any veggie this way (carrots, cauliflower etc)"

MealPrepSunday,3dak2z,RedheadFox,3,Wed Jul 15 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"Simmered meat goes very well with all kashas due to having some broth to pour over kasha, you somehow have figured the most go-to recipe of one of the most kasha eating countries."
MealPrepSunday,3dak2z,SirKlokkwork,3,Wed Jul 15 10:08:04 2015 UTC,"That's maybe because I live in the one of the most kasha eating countries. :) That's the way we usually prepare it in my family, and definitely my favorite one (I'm a big fan of mushrooms, mushroom sauce and mushroom soup).  You can also cook it in a stew, it can be a great addition, but you must be careful with dosing because buckwheat kasha tends to increase in a volume a lot when cooked. Of course, I assumed the OP is talking about buckwheat kasha, is that correct?"
MealPrepSunday,3dak2z,RedheadFox,2,Wed Jul 15 10:25:30 2015 UTC,"cooked kasha   I'm still new to the whole kasha thing .. does ""cooked kasha"" mean boiled?  Any recipes for mushroom sauces? :)"
MealPrepSunday,3dak2z,RedheadFox,3,Wed Jul 15 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I meant boiled kasha. Just boil it in water according to instructions (you can add a little salt in the water for better taste). For mushroom sauce I usually use button mushrooms or porcini mushrooms. I'm having a little trouble writing a recipe because I don't  really measure my ingredients (just using approximated amounts based on my experience), but this one is very similar to how I do it. The only things I do different: replace olive oil with sunflower oil (in my opinion, olive oil has a little too strong taste for this gravy and can mask the taste of mushrooms), replace sage with parsley, replace butter with a little amount of heavy cream and drink wine instead of cooking it. :)"

This recipe does it right."
MealPrepSunday,3dak2z,lillith32,2,Wed Jul 15 20:02:31 2015 UTC,From my further Googling and posts on here I am coming to the conclusion that kasha is more like one ingredient of many .. rather than the main ingredient.

MealPrepSunday,3dapu1,PetrusOctavius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"Cowboy caviar is a good option, IMO. It's supposed to be kept cool and allowed to marinate, so it is a good meal prep option.  Mason jar salads are pretty popular around here as well.  Baking your vegetables in a little olive oil with some salt and pepper is another option.  Steamed vegetables don't keep super well and tend to get kind of mushy by the end of a week. Boiled can be okay though.  Anyways, good on you for working to get more vegetables in your diet. I think you'll find that you feel better with more in your food. There's a lot of ways to sneak veggies into meals, just be willing to try new things and you'll find something you like."

It changed my mind about cauliflower in general and I haven't stopped thinking about this dish. Anyway, if calorie intake is important to you, then consider using cauliflower instead of rice. Basically you just grate raw cauliflower and then use it like you would use rice. Fry it and then add the fried veggies/egg/meat that you would add. It is a great source of carbs and vitamins while being less caloric than even brown rice.  I've been telling everyone about this use of cauliflower because it was one of the tastiest and most unexpected meals I've made."
MealPrepSunday,3d6u21,jeffulya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:28:19 2015 UTC,I will have to give that a try. Calorie intake is a big factor for me as I'm in the process to lose weight. So I will have to take you on your word and get some cauliflower next time I go to the store.

MealPrepSunday,3d5cy4,BrownSt0ner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:25:47 2015 UTC,Mine don't really do that. Have you tried toasting the bread before assembling them? I also don't put any condiments on them until after I reheat them. I also don't freeze mine. I just make enough for the week and keep them in the fridge. Maybe freezing and defrosting them adds to the mushiness? Have you tried looking for a recipe? I think I saw one on Food 52 or The Kitchn that had some trouble shooting ideas. Hope this helps!

If not, the moisture is probably coming from the spinach; make sure it's very crisp and dry. Then up the egg:spinach ratio and make sure they're fully cooked. If you're just using eggs, you should be able to overcook them until they are basically rubber so you want to find a ""sweet spot"" between too chewy and too soggy."

MealPrepSunday,3d75ju,cheesechick,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Oatmeal is a good one! I switch it up by preparing it three different ways:  (1) Slowcooker - result is same as doing it on the stovetop, I'm just lazy. I use steel cut oats for this and make a big batch and freeze the leftovers as individual portions in mason jars. With steel cut oats, you pretty much have to double boil 'em when you're using a slowcooker to get the right texture. Recipe for Banana Oatmeal - I do this but with a 3:1 liquid ratio and usually throw in a bunch of blueberries.  (2) Baked - uses rolled oats and has a very different texture from stovetop oatmeal. Again I make a big batch and freeze individual portions. Recipe for Apple Cherry Baked Oatmeal  (3) Refrigerator Oats - again uses rolled oats. These are a mixture of some kind of dairy (usually a combination of greek yogurt and milk, but I use Kefir) and oats. I eat them cold. It's kind of like pudding or an oatmeal smoothie. Technique and flavor suggestions here These I just prep in a single serving on the night before - not in bulk - but it takes literally like two minutes.  Between having 3 different ways to prepare it and endless flavoring options there's a lot of variety you can get from it!  Beyond that, how much time do you have to prep your morning meals? None at all? If you have a few minutes and can at least scramble some eggs you could prep seasoning for said eggs ahead of time - chop up some herbs, veggies, and spices into individual flavor ""packets"" and keep them in the fridge, then just throw them in with your eggs. Whenever we make chili, my boyfriend and I always set some aside to just toss into our eggs the next day. You could also make something like huevos rancheros like this - just prep the rice and salsa ahead of time. We make a lot of burrito filling and then freeze it in individual portions, and sometimes throw that onto eggs and wrap 'em in a tortilla as a quick breakfast burrito too."
MealPrepSunday,3d3n0n,poor_empty_pants,12,Mon Jul 13 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"I've been making this bowl for the last few weeks and it's quickly become my favorite! I like a slightly larger lunch, but the portions could easily be altered if you need more or less.    1/4c Quinoa - 107 cal 1/4c Low Fat Ricotta Cheese - 50 cal 2oz~ Kale - 28 cal 90g Red Garnet Sweet Potato - 90 cal 1.5 Chopped Veggie patty - 150 cal   425 cal total | 29.8g Protein | 59.9g Carbs | 12.3g Fat  I have a rice cooker that I start the quinoa in first. While that's going, I chop the sweet potatoes into cubes and place on a baking sheet. I spray those with olive oil spray and sprinkle with garlic salt. I put those in the oven at 375 along with the veggie patties for about 20 minutes. While those are in the oven, I steam the kale...and do some last minute dishes and get my tupperware ready to go. The quinoa takes about 30-40 minutes to cook so once that's done, which is just about the time my oven items are ready. I portion everything out and stow in the fridge!   I use the ricotta as a dressing of sorts and just mix everything together come lunch time. So far, these last really well for me throughout the week and I just heat them up at lunch time. :)"

MealPrepSunday,3d3n0n,ItsNotSherbert,2,Mon Jul 13 19:36:13 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that recipe is per serving? Do you make 4 at once?

MealPrepSunday,3d3n0n,tamazapan,9,Mon Jul 13 19:35:57 2015 UTC,I've never seen anyone eat ricotta like this. Do you stir everything together? It looks freaking delicious.
MealPrepSunday,3d3n0n,tamazapan,5,Mon Jul 13 09:27:27 2015 UTC,"When I make similar recipes, I don't stir everything. I just kind of get a little ricotta on my fork and then go for whatever else I want. If you decide to make something similar, I recommend topping the ricotta with a little drizzle of good olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. The oil helps smooth out the texture a bit, and the s & p helps with flavor (otherwise it can be a bit bland imo). Anyway, that's my admittedly unsolicited advice! :)"

I heat the bowl up before eating it so the cheese warms enough that it can mix pretty well, though it still maintains that ricotta texture."

Chicken breast, roasted, 100 grams: 165 cal, 4g fat, 0g carb, 31g protein  Chicken thigh, roasted, 100 grams: 209 cal, 11g fat, 0g carb, 26g protein"
MealPrepSunday,3d4nj3,alysli,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"I actually use whole rotisserie chickens more often than breasts.  They have more flavor, it saves a ton of time, and the price is usually about the same by weight.  I tear all the meat off and discard the skin/bones then use it for rice and veggie bowls or burritos.  If you're worried about macros or sodium just check the nutrition facts.  edit:  strain the juice from the container and add back to the meat after shredding"
MealPrepSunday,3d4nj3,Smeeklekins,2,Mon Jul 13 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to your nutritional question, but I can say that whole chickens are more cost effective in terms of what you get out of them. Pull the meat off for multiple meals, remove the skin to reduce fat, and use the bones for soup broth and stock.   For nutrition, you're getting more lean when you just get the breast. Whole chicken has dark meat."
MealPrepSunday,3d4nj3,Ayxjay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:01:50 2015 UTC,You can look it up in MyFitnessPal or wolfram alpha. They might be able to give you estimates. Are you cutting the chicken apart?
MealPrepSunday,3d4nj3,CeseED,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"You could also buy some chicken breasts and cook them in the crockpot! Put like 1-2 cups of low sodium chicken broth in the bottom, toss in your breasts, and cook on low for 8 hours."
MealPrepSunday,3d4nj3,CaptainCoral,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:21 2015 UTC,"We seem to be in the same boat!  My meal prep in times of extreme duress may just be chopping frozen chicken breasts into blocks for stir frying during the week. Stir frying is very fast. Dinner is the pre-chopped chicken blocks, a bag of frozen vegetables, and pre-made sauce, or in a pinch, just soy sauce.   I am not a fan of the whole chicken because I feel that it is impossible to accurately calculate the macros, even if I weigh it. Some parts are fattier than others, and in some places, the texture just really turns me off. Plus, if I'm spending time pulling it off the bone and cutting it up, I might as well just use chicken breasts. So I like to stick with chicken breasts for time, taste, and texture."

MealPrepSunday,3d41yj,LoKx,6,Mon Jul 13 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"This question is complicated and outside the scope of this subreddit, I would check out the diet area of the faq over at r/fitness.   Essentially, your only necessary macronutrient is protein, which you can get from meat, eggs, or beans. Fat is also necessary to a certain level, but most foods have enough fat to where you don't need to worry about it. Carbs are completely unnecessary but very tasty, and are harmless if it fits your macros.  I tend to just decide how much protein I want and fill the rest with carbs and fat. For example, if I have a meal I need to be 800 kcal and 80 g protein, I say ""OK, I'll add a 14 oz pork chop, which is ~80 g protein and ~500 kcal. That leaves 300 kcal so I can add half a cup of rice."" Something like that.   I just worry about protein and let the fat and carbs fall where they may. Many diet stretegies put restrictions on these, for example if you were on a ""keto"" diet you would just eat protein and fat and try to cut out carbs."

Cooked on high for about five hours, then pulled out and shredded the chicken. I reduced the remaining liquid on the stove with a bit of cornstarch.   It made a ton...I froze half of the chicken for a future stir fry."

MealPrepSunday,3d22m9,BeamMeUpScarlett,2,Tue Jul 14 00:34:41 2015 UTC,Probably! You may want to add it at the end though. I'm not sure but I think prolonged cooking might take away from the zing of ginger.

MealPrepSunday,3d2j72,MaryQueenofSquats,3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"First off, the album is in reverse order, sorry! I'm apparently terrible at mobile redditing.  Sadly my oven broke this week so I had to improvise in order to meal prep. I wanted to make barbecue teriyaki chicken breast with sauteed squash and zucchini and rice. I have a casserole crock pot (rather than a normal one) so I wasn't sure how this would work out, but I went for it and put rice, water, my veggies, and my chicken breasts (marinated in barbecue and teriyaki sauce) in there and put it on high for 3ish hours.  Unfortunately I didn't put enough water in so the rice is a little dodgy, but it all tastes good and the chicken is thoroughly cooked! So that's boxed up for lunches for the week :)  The other thing I wanted to make was a quiche. I'd never made one before but you can get such great macros from them! So I made it with the toaster oven!   I did Alton Brown's refrigerator pie recipe. A frozen pie crust, diced ham, spinach, and cheddar cheese, plus a royale of 1 cup milk and two beaten eggs poured over top. Baked it in the toaster oven for 40ish minutes at 350 and it came out absolutely gorgeous! So that's dinner for the next few days :)   I wish I could have written all this in the imgur album but it didn't give me the option, so, sorry! Let me know if anyone wants more details or macros etc."

Our goals are more financial than caloric so I don't have a nutritional breakdown, though cooking at home and making healthy food will naturally be better for us dietary-wise. Our menu this week was influenced partly by local sales. It came out to $95 total for two people, which yielded 12 meals plus snacks at $12 per person per day, or ~$4 per meal.  Breakfast for him: Bacon, poblano peppers, onions, eggs.\  Breakfast for me: Oatmeal topped with poached pear slices (currently steeping in this picture in a cinnamon/vanilla/allspice/honey syrup - oatmeal not pictured).  Lunch: Pumpkin poblano soup (roasted chicken, pumpkin, poblano, carrots, onion, topped with guac).  Dinner: Spiced beef and pork with spaghetti squash.

MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,Skymaiden,7,Sun Jul 12 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks. Meal prepping helps me to keep on track with the eating.     I was gonna do lentil ""meat""-balls tonight. I just mix (cooked) lentils with a bit of finely chopped veggies, onions, spices. Then add a binding agent - like eggs for a vegetarian option or soaked chia-seeds for a vegan version, along with a bit of flour. Then you just bake or fry them like normal meatballs.   I might do some sort of veggie/tofu dish too this week. Just some veggies on the pan, and some tamari/ginger-marinaded tofu. Mega easy and really delicious.  I was thinking about a chilled green been and pea soup for this week too. It's basically just blended peas and green beans with a bit of veggie stock and maybe some herbs or spices. And a nice bit of seeds and whatnot as topping.   I sometimes do cauliflower steaks too. You just cut a slice down the middle of a whole cauliflower and barbecue/fry that. I normally let it sit in some marinade before, and it's really good. Works well in burgers as well.   Don't know if that was the kind of stuff you were asking for?"

MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,NotGettingFucked,3,Sun Jul 12 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks. It's a bit different each week; more fresh veggies takes longer to prep and some weeks I bake bread too. So that takes a bit longer. But normally around 1-2 hours, i would guess."
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,NotGettingFucked,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:28:40 2015 UTC,What kind of bread do you make?
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,2,Sun Jul 12 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"I do whole wheat loafs or buns mostly, sometimes danish-style rye bread if I got a sourdough going, or rye crackers if I'm really lazy. (crackers don't need to rise and they are basically just water, rye flour and a bit of olie and salt.)"
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,Mafmi,2,Mon Jul 13 04:48:05 2015 UTC,olie   What is that? I'm semi new to bread making and never heard that term.
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,2,Mon Jul 13 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Heh. Typo, sorry. I just mean oil. I normally use rapeseed or olive :)"
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,Mafmi,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:19 2015 UTC,"lol thanks. I even tried googling it. Would you mind posting your buns recipe and your whole wheat? Do you use fresh ground wheat?  The best bread I've made is a simple sourdough but I forgot about it and now have to start my starter over. I've tried making regular ""white"" bread but it came out really bland. Although, I could just be really used to store bought and might need some adjusting."
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,2,Mon Jul 13 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"I actually don't really use a specific recipe when I bake.  But for my regular non-fancy day to day-bread(""normal"" sized loaf or maybe 8-12 buns) I use about half a liter of lukewarm water, a tablespoon of salt, a tiny splash of oil (maybe a ½ teaspoon) and about 15 g of yeast and however much flour the water can absorb.  Give it a really good kneading with your hands - 15 minutes at least - before letting it rise.      I also like to use different types of flour; graham, rye, spelt, barley malt or emmer, and mix that in with regular wheat flour. It makes your bread so much more interesting. I don't use fresh ground flour, but do I use a good store bought organic brand. Fresh ground flour would be so nice, though - it's not very common here and it's really expensive, unfortunately. Trying new types of flour might help with ""bland"" bread - also not putting enough salt in the dough could cause bland bread, in my experience.   Yeah, the sourdough is a harsh mistress! I forget about mine all the time - luckily my mom always have one going, so I can always get a bit of that, rather than starting over."
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,2,Tue Jul 14 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I haven't actually baked bread since about Feb. Since I lost my sourdough starter. Fresh ground isn't overly common here either, I just bought some wheat berries and plan on grinding it myself. I got it from Walmart.com for $16 for 26 pounds, that's unfortunately the cheapest I've ground plus you have to have a grinder (which I don't have yet -_-)     I've left out the salt by mistake and I can definitely agree that without salt it is bland as hell. I haven't really tried different flours though, I'll try a half and half next time, with wheat and regular flour."
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,3,Tue Jul 14 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Yum, your hummus looks delicious. Where in the world do you buy tahini from? I have been looking and can't find it anywhere."
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,diemunkiesdie,2,Sun Jul 12 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"I can find tahini in my local super market (Meijer) in the ""international"" aisle. But you can always substitute it with sesame oil (which is how I make mine.)"
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,mandabbyx,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you use the same measurements with sesame oil as you would with tahini?
MealPrepSunday,3d02gn,lovekeepsherintheair,3,Sun Jul 12 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, I've only ever made it with sesame oil.

I think it might be a child's size container but whatever. I didn't want to make a week's worth of containers because I may want to switch it up a bit (maybe steam some vegetables one day or something).... Put hot sauce on the chicken... Whatever.   Pictured is chopped up vegetables consisting of broccoli, carrots, bell peppers (red and green), spinach, and another salad mix thing. Next to it is rotisserie chicken that I am far too challenged to cut properly. Next to that is my new lunch carrier thing and the lid to it. I added some pretzels, hummus, and made my own dressing of oil and vinegar.   Mixed together in the individual lunch it's 430 calories including the hummus and pretzels.   For snacks (not pictures) I have a tiny baggie of like ten almonds, and another tiny baggie of 3 strawberries and a few blueberries.

MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,eelgin,5,Mon Jul 13 02:18:54 2015 UTC,"Haha funny you should post this, I just did meal prep for a whole week for my husband and I with lunch bentos. I'll edit and post a picture. But basically I have a Japanese omelet, half cup vegetables, 3-4 oz Pan fried salmon and 1/2 cup - 2/3 cup brown rice. You organize the box in a cute fashion but basic rules are 1/2 carbs, 1/4 protein and 1/4 veggies. You can manipulate that to fit your diet. The Japanese omelet is one egg, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp soy sauce. You scramble that all together and basically make an omelet except you roll the egg instead of folding. Good luck and I hope this helps.  Edit to add pic:http://i.imgur.com/fxRLZtL.jpg"

MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,Take14theteam,3,Mon Jul 13 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'll let you know how it tastes on Friday lol. Before this, I've only have had it for two days."
MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,peacewing,3,Mon Jul 13 13:56:50 2015 UTC,"This is basically the guideline I follow, except that I have altered it to fit my macros. (1/2 protein, 1/4 fat & carbs). I also weigh all my food items so I know what I'm eating, and that each box is equal. It's helpful to have those little bento boxes, but I use microwavable plastic food storage that have dividers in them. I think they are by Rubbermaid. I keep them frozen, or in the fridge. If they are frozen, they'll make it to lunch. If they are not, (since I am a little paranoid), I'll throw in a thin ice pack. You can buy an ice pack that is a thin sheet that will keep everything cool.  I choose to keep everything cool because I'm not sure how long it'll be until I get a chance to have lunch. I'm usually okay eating things cool or heating it up in a nearby microwave.   My other strategy is to freeze the rice in individual, portioned balls, and then wrap them in saran wrap. The plastic wrap is microwavable. If I want a warm rice with lunch, I'll take it out of the freezer, microwave it until hot, then put it in my lunch box. It'll be warm at lunch. Or I'll put it frozen in my lunch box, and microwave it at lunch.  (EDIT: I re-read and it sounded ambiguous... I meal prep each lunch and the rice ball packages on the weekend, which is why I freeze everything, to preserve them until I want to eat them. )  If I'm going traditional box, bento boxes are sold that are also insulated, to keep things warm. I will do this if I am making a box for that that day, or the night before. If it's the night before, I'll put everything in the fridge, then heat it up in the morning before I go.   Asian food is pretty simple, and most things will last until lunch if you heat it up in the morning. YMMV. I'm Korean, and my lunch, if hot in the morning, lasts until lunch, and I haven't food poisoned myself yet."
MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,Take14theteam,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:22 2015 UTC,Are the divided containers worth buying? I also just use plastic containers and to make it look more traditional I stuff it full of veggies.
MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,peacewing,2,Tue Jul 14 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"For the practicality - yes. They can be frozen, go in the microwave, and if they take a beating at work or school, it's really not a big deal. If you lose one or break one, they don't really cost a lot to replace, and they are dishwasher safe in the top rack.   I like the traditional look, purely for aesthetics, but usually I'm cramped for time, so it's very rare that I bust out ""traditional"" mode. The container isn't as versatile, you have to hand-wash, etc. But it's cool for picnic times, visiting people, etc."

MealPrepSunday,3d2vpo,RaccoonDispenser,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. None of my Japanese, Korean, or Chinese friends have ever said anything of the word's offensive nature. In fact they've advised me to avoid using the term Asian as a generalization because it is a generalization. It groups together several major cultures which 1.) have a fierce sense of pride in their identity and 2.) that are fundamentally different in every way. It can be a touchy subject grouping them together or even worse, mixing them up.    However the internet has confirmed your statement and have edited the main post accordingly.    Edit: Spelling"

You can also do mini egg muffins (frittata baked in muffin tins)  We also made English muffin pizzas and vacuum sealed and froze them with awesome success. Bake in oven or toaster oven to defrost. We used mini pepperoni and they were perfect. Just toast the English muffins first.   Meatballs frozen do amazing as well and make fast dinners. I've even boiled them in the vacuum sealed bag to reheat which made fast cleanup. Swedish or Italian - both do great.   I'm still playing with latkes frozen. I don't know what went wrong last time but we've always baked our latkes so I assumed freezing the onion and potato nests would be easy but something didn't work. But I didn't have the vacuum sealer then either.   Oh waffles and pancakes and French toast all freeze well. And just toast them.   If you can get chicken salad or make it I adore stuffed croissants - chicken salad baked in croissant dough. (Note we make chicken salad with cream cheese not mayo) I have no idea how they freeze because there has never been leftovers but I bet frozen in their uncooked state they could cook out fairly well.   Sorry this got long. Hope it helps!"

I have some zucchini laying around that wouldn't mind being turned into baking vessels.

It would be great to see credit and a reference back to this subreddit for blog content sourced from here.  There is another commercial site that gets blasted for just sourcing content from Reddit.
