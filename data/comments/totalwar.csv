totalwar,3e3pnk,NickTM,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"It's weird, they can recruit every faction's units, depending on which region is it. For example they can recruit english knights from Caernarvon, Spanish cavalry from Valencia, etc. I'm not exactly sure how it works for them.  They also get random army and navy spawns every turn, but their economy is really weak, you'll go bankrupt in no time, unless you disband everything and start from scratch.  Their armies also instantly die when defeated, they won't get the option to pay for prisoners or retreat after defeat."

totalwar,3dz7pj,Dogpool,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"The Rome 2 one is definitely dope, very reminiscent of Lord of the Rings(Minas Tirith). I think the Shogun 2 one suffers from a lack of color variety. The soldier's armor/uniforms, the snow on the ground, the sky and the snow-covered buildings...there's just so much grey and white. Screenshots/edits like these definitely look better with more color variance. Just my two cents!"
totalwar,3dz7pj,BluFour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with both opinions. The reason I wanted to shop the shogun picture was to capture the bleak setting, soldiers dying and a fortress crumbling; the lack of color made me want to do that. I'll take those 2 cents!"

totalwar,3e26dg,Helot_spartan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"I dunno why everyone always suggests playing as Rome. Yea, they might be the easiest faction (not even sure about that), but if you want to learn the game, the best approach IMO is to start with a very small faction (Sparta, Athens, Arverni, Iceni). Any choices you make will have very visible outcomes, and you'll much more quickly understand the mechanics behind balancing food, Public order, income, etc... With a larger faction like Rome, you'll start off confused and slightly overwhelmed with the number of regions, and you won't have time to get comfortable with them because you'll get very quickly caught up in wars all around you"
totalwar,3e26dg,chrismanbob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:07 2015 UTC,Limited generals on the campain map. Increases with the number of provinces you own. What exactly confused you? Which previous tw games have you played?
totalwar,3e26dg,chrismanbob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"Though didn't really spend that much time with the mechanics.   Rome 2 is a strategy game, and like most RTS they have a lot of different aspect that will require different strategies, so a question as vague as ""what do"" can only be answered with answers just as vague or answers too in depth for you to properly understand right now as you haven't really played the game.  Play the tutorials, they're pretty good at showing you the game and they're not boring.  Rome is an easy faction to start off as, your first step will be to click on the first army you see then right click on the city directly north of Roma. Build more troops and repeat slightly similar versions to the instructions above until the map is red.   If you're really struggling, I'd recommend watching a play through on Youtube.  As for Mods... You must walk walk before you can run.  This comment might seem a little bit snide but that's just my irritation at the question being so vague, help us to help you, do you have any previous total war experience, are you getting fucked on the battlefield, do you not understand how diplomacy works, come on man. There's a lot of stuff in this game, narrow that shit down."
totalwar,3e26dg,chrismanbob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe the questions were a bit vague, though I was just wondering what the main changes was from Rome total war 1 and Medieval total war 2, which I have numerous hours in, to now. Don't expect this game to actually required any super deep thinking, just curious since I heard a lot changed with the ui and other things since empire."
totalwar,3e26dg,watashat,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"Aight, well that's some more to work with.  Ok main differences:   Agents are useful. A high level enemy agent can and will decimate your army, you need you own agents to be able to suppress theirs as well as buff your own forces. Civil War. This will happens once you get big enough, half of your armies and territories suddenly become your enemy is challenging to deal with. You can no longer just build everything in every settlement, you must learn to balance out having food, wealth and military centers around your empire.  Generals now control recruitment and armies. All settlements will have a garrison dictated by the buildings present. Naval forces can take coastal cities.   One thing certainly remains the same. Diplomacy is kind of useless, the AI is almost entirely incapable of understanding that relations or treaties may be mutually beneficial, they only understand that you are human and you must die."
totalwar,3e26dg,Escaimbra,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Very interesting about the agents, I thought the assassin’s in Rome total war 1 were pretty powerful already. Hehe loved training those guys up slowly to become better and better. Wasn’t the civil war mechanic in Barbarian invasion of the dlc for rome 1? Is it even more intense? Yeah I heard Generals being required to have armies, sounds interesting, and I suppose gets rid of the problems of having a bunch of tiny armies. Very excited to have actual naval battles!! Hopefully it controls somewhat well. Thanks for the advice!"
totalwar,3e26dg,hejduk,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Assassins were quite good in oldschoolrome but in the new one a good spy can take 800 men off your army and stop it from moving in a turn, and then do the exact same shit next turn. Stacked Agents can make or break an invasion and the champions can be used to train your entire army to be all be 3 gold chevron. IMO they're a little too prevalent in the game, but they make it interesting.  Yeah the civil war mechanic is pretty brutal now, not was bad as it was on first release (the rebellion that spawned for some poor bastard http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img543/7396/imr1.jpg) but it will take some time to bring it under control."
totalwar,3e26dg,Elitehamster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:30 2015 UTC,"On the campaign map as you are choosing what buildings to create, take your time. Remember that you have to balance producing enough food, with public order, with making money, with having military buildings to raise armies. One way that people accomplish this is by specializing provinces (don't worry about that for now though, just try to keep each province going). As you are making decisions, take the time to read the effects of each building and think each one through. It will be slow going initially but before long you'll start developing a knack for knowing what to do.  On the battle map, the easiest way to play is as Rome with a core of heavy infantry, supported by a few missile units, a small amount of cavalry, and artillery.  However, the best advice I've seen on this subreddit for new players is this: start with an army of entirely hastati (& your general, of course). Using that fight a battle by basically just charging your line into the enemy. As it is happening, take a look at what goes wrong. Maybe the enemy will charge some cavalry into your flank, or you won't be able to chase down those annoying slingers at the end. As you spot issues, think about what would solve that.  Basically, this is a strategy game, which means planning and thinking. So take your time and try to analyze what is happening and how you can improve your play. It takes time, but when you vanquish a vastly superior force or win a multi-front war, it is completely worth it!"

totalwar,3e287e,RicerGee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:35 2015 UTC,God I love that trailer. Still gives me goosebumps.
totalwar,3e287e,vincent118,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the Wind of Magic used. I don't know if they're limiting the Winds to each race, the Empire has access to the standard 8 (just not with the same Wizard).  First, I hope they get more than just the big ultimates.    Fire: The Burning Head is a flaming skull launched by the Wizard that kinda acts like a cannonball. The ultimate is called ""Flame Storm"" and does exactly what it says. Light: There's a spell that rallies all within range. We already have that in Rome, so that's good. The ultimate is the Timewarp that lets a unit move around and attack really quickly. Beasts: I don't remember the other spells but the ultimate turns you into a Monster (Hydra, Manticore, Dragon, etc).  Life: Has a heal spell that'll restore lost units in a regiment. Very handy. The ultimate is this ground sucky thing that I forgot. Heavens: The Comet of Cassandora. I built army lists just around this spell. Big freaking comet. Fun times. Metal: There's a spell that rusts your target's armour, which is pretty cool. You can also burn those heavily armoured units up by heating said metal. The ultimate turns them into metal. Shadow: Okkam's Mindrazor allows the use of Leadership in place of Strength to deal damage. Could be very powerful when used properly. Pit of Shades swallows up units. Death: Soul Leach pits the caster and its target into a duel of wills. Perhaps a great sniper spell. The Purple Sun of Xereus is this floating ball of death that moves around the battlefield randomly.   So I hope the Empire gets access to all the Winds of Magic. The Vampire Counts and the Tomb Kings should have access to Death.  I'd love it if they included the Dwarfs' Anvils. (Oh, in Warhammer it's dwarfs not dwarves for some reason.)   Also, I wonder if they'll be adding the ""Passives"". I forgot what they're called, but they're the benefits you get if you successfully cast something."
totalwar,3e287e,marwynn,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"My guess is  The empire will have a very aggressive and more destructive approach to magic, such as the comet and them having fire mages. Warrior priests might have minor healing or buffing spells  The Vampire Counts will most likely focus on massive, possibly armywide, buffing spells. Possibly some advanced shadow magic. They could also get the ability to ressurect troops, but it will be hard to implement and a lot of work done, so doubting we'll see it.  The Greenskins will have incredibly destructive magic; their magic basically functions by there being a lot of very angry and excited orks at the same place, and one ork funneling all of this anger and excitement into magic. The foot of gork, for example. In this sense their magic should be VERY potent, but also have an easy time backfiring - if a ork shaman is too weak to handle the amount of magic going through him, his (and usually all orks around him) head explodes.  The Dwarves dislike magic in the sense the other races use them, but use magical runes to buff their weapons, armour and can even do actual spells with them. But, mostly, it'll just be augmentations that you'll be able to put on units or something like that and to make up for the lack of magic you have vastly superior technology, to the point where even The Empire has troubles keeping up. The Dwarves are the only race in warhammer that has successfully built a working submarine (successfully is a relative term, however).  Other than all this, the magicians of every race has access to the basic schools of magic, such as fire, nature and shadow, meaning that there will maybe be one or at the most 2 MASSIVE spells per factions, and then a lot of minor once, like small fireballs or spooky ghosts. You can do a lot with it."
totalwar,3e287e,tosspride,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"In the table top there is a large variety of spells and ""schools"" of magic to choose from for most factions. Most factions can do anything from that comet, to fireballs, to shadow thingies.   Orcs and dwarves however have their own things: Dwarves can't use normal magic but they can forge runes which do anything from being built into their weapons to give them various effects, to being freshly made on the battlefield and causing an earthquake or some such (I could be wrong about the earthquake, someone who plays dwarves please correct me)  Orcs also have their own unique racial magic which goes from the giant foot, to making people's heads explode, to making them really angry..... well angrier at least.  TLDR: Everyone in the world of warhammer has a wide array at magical fun available to smite their enemies, help their friends, and occasionally destroy themselves/friends in a blaze of hell fire on accident"

When I discovered Darthmod for Empire it was 2 years after I'd been playing Vanilla, and I had just gotten used to the games foibles.  There's a big cultural shift with the power of internet communities for games that makes people WAY more critical of games upon release. The way I perceive it, before it was mostly adults on forums/chat boards for games, and kids just sat through and were satiated with the quality of games. Now since everyone who can wipe their own butt has a smartphone and access to the internet, people are seeing whats wrong with games a lot more, and have a platform to talk about it, and argue for change with developers. I'm not sure we're more cynical, but I'd definitely say more people are aware of the status of the games they are playing, with that comes more criticism."

I totally agree so his defeat at Waterloo and, the First Republic's naval defeat at the battle of Trafalgar, was a good thing; Most other leaders in the west at the time also didn't take ethnic races into account. What Napoleon did was that he showed the French 'lower classes' that they were able to stand up to tyrannous rulers. This lead to further revolutions and shuffling of leaders a bit resulting ultimately resulting in the IIIe république, which seen the implementation of universal male suffrage and abolition of slavery lasted until the Axis forces occupied parts of the French empire and parts of metropolitan France.

By Waterloo many of his top generals and advisor's were disenfranchised with him, they saw through his lies and hypocrisy.    Most other leaders in the west at the time also didn't take ethnic races into account.   True but Britain was doing well in comparison.   What Napoleon did was that he showed the French 'lower classes' that they were able to stand up to tyrannous rulers.   They actually rose up before Napoleon, he just took it to another level.

totalwar,3e15qe,Frankly109,10,Tue Jul 21 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"I had the same fight against the goddamn Gallic Confederacy as Rome. It was glorious.   They were 'reborn' 3 times as gallic states joined the near-dead Confederacy at the last moment, at one stage the Nervii joined up, bringing the Confederacy from 1 sieged province to 13 provinces. Their armies would often survive total obliteration as they loved attacking legions with 4 stacks at once, so then I'd have clean-up duty on 4 heavily depeleted general units and ragtag levy freeman remnants for the next 5 turns. Oh, and they would be in raiding stance the whole time so most of my new settlements hated me intensely for years. Plus those harmless looking ragtag warbands would often hire up large amounts of Mercenaries with their stolen goods if left alone and terrorize the countryside for years to come.   Each time it looked like a final push on the Confederacy was about to take shape another empire would declare war or Italy would be threatened.   At one stage the east coast had been taken by the Veneti, Carthage was readying a ridiculous invasion fleet and things were looking sour with both the Suebi to the far north-east and the Iceni to the far north-west. The GC had rallied with the Nervii takeover and were pushing back hard with their independent Boii allies. I lost 2 stacks and almost lost my precious Legio Italica I in a tense battle with 3 stacks of Boii attacking in the forest. They survived with heavy losses and were out of action retreating and recruiting until a miracle happened.  A small, one-province faction called the Edetani implored me to take them on as a client state. Friendless and on the verge of collapse, I agreed. This pact drastically improved relations with the Iceni and importantly, the rival Celtic Confederation of Iberia. Driven by mutual hatred of the Gallic Confederation and Carthage as well as thawing relations I soon had two Defensive Alliances encompassing the entirety of the Iberian Peninsula and what would become north-western Europe. This led to a humongous shift in the balance of power. The GC was annihilated, their last general died raiding what would become the English Channel. Allied fleets assembled to burn North Africa while I managed to limp home and take back Italy, destroy the Veneti and build a massive recruitment center in the ashes of their small empire. The Suebi, perhaps sensing a shift in the winds, agree to a Defensive Alliance but continues to refuse offers of any higher cooperation to this day.   TLDR: one-province faction changes the fate of the ancient world, Gallic Confederation are butts and never knew when they should stay dead, Rome II became my favourite TW over the course of a single campaign."

Pergamon has captured most of Egypt, and after I had subdued/subjugated the northern steppe tribes, I could come in as well and I'm currently overrunning Media Atropatene.

Also focusing on Germanic or ex-Roman factions might help the other be friendlier."
totalwar,3e15qe,DukeofKent91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:18 2015 UTC,Normally I would as well as I did start one before but save file corrupted. I am playing with the Radious mod but I don't think would make much difference! They had made alliances with all my immediate invasion targets which was the issue also!  The Celts have just as hey wanted loads of money to join as they had their own problems with Gaul and Hispania! cost me 8000 each! but ebdanians have started to be worth it as sending loads of troops over!   I did do the immediate south ones but they were in mass land grab mode from the get go!
totalwar,3e15qe,BeatlesForSale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:20 2015 UTC,Playing a coop game on Empire with my friend. He was Holland I was Prussia. I spent a good 200 years in a gridlock war with Austria. He ended up bankrolling me for most of the campaign just so I could keep up with the sheer amount of armies Austria was somehow pumping out. Eventually I eradicated those Austrian bastards and I have never been more relieved. Then all I had to worry about was repaying the massive debt to my friend I'd built up.

totalwar,3e15qe,grey_hat_uk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:27 2015 UTC,"In Shogun 2, since the Hatakeyama (two interlocking green circles like the Olympics symbol) clan's lands are really spread out, actually eliminating them for good can take a long time. For instance, as the Hojo, I started my war with them after already making good progress against the Tokugawa and Takeda fairly early on and didn't finish off their last territories in the Northeast until not only after Realm Divide but even shortly before the 40 provinces I needed to finish the Long Campaign. Funnily enough, they asked for peace after I was already successfully invading their Westernmost lands, and I did take the offer, but war was re-declared a short few turns later (even before the diplomatic penalty for re-declaring expired) due to Realm Divide dragging them back into the fight. So I was effectively at continuous war with them since nearly the beginning of the campaign to nearly the end of the campaign.  Also, I'm not sure if reputation actually contributes to the AI's behavior, but the ""Treacherous"" Bessho have caused me no end of headaches by always hiding out in forests when I have to fight them, and despite them being a fairly tiny clan at that stage of the game, they still manage to build up forces to at least raid and get destroyed by me when I get tired of their antics. There are few clans I truly despised as much as them in that campaign."

Number of battles was around 4 or 5 navel engagements.  real actual war was most likely M2 Novgorod and Egypt, people just kept getting in the way."

I decided to lead the charge against them and saw my full stacks decimated while trying to push them back, without success. They didn't manage to take my lands, either, so it was just a horrific back-and-forth in one province in what is now Poland. Tens of thousands died in that one region alone.   Or Empire, playing as Russia and invading India. I didn't have enough men to both hold regions and conquer new ones, so I would march out and defeat Maratha armies in the field, see my territories rebel, then march back and stamp out the rebellion... This back-and-forth for dozens of turns."

Seleucids were amazing in that game, yes they were but for some reason I was always fighting Pontus and Parthia and Egypt would bring 3 stacks and fight me like crazy.    I held Cairo for most of my campaign and there were bloody battles for years over the Nile river.  That was my most famous war but the one I had the longest was in Medieval total war 2 when I was Spain fighting that Almohod empire.  After destroying the Argons and spending 20 years trying to convert El Cid to my cause the Almohod's got to big and it was a battle lasting the entire game.    I love and hate you El Cid.....

They just kept picking up cities from the Gauls, and it was slow moving for my armies, as training and retraining took forever (most of my armies were armored hoplites).  I've also had an extremely long war with the HRE in Medieval II, playing as France. I just ignored the Pope, got excommunicated and just finished the damn war. Then Poland attacked me..."

I personally have come to accept Realm Divide as being important to the game but if you want to play without it, that's the way to go. (Check if it works for you I'm away from home at the moment)"
totalwar,3e2069,Shamoneyo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:06 2015 UTC,How exactly did he do this? Anyone know?  If it's just editing a text file or something I'll keep the rest of the game but just edit the realm divide thing for this and FotS. This doesn't seem to work for FotS which is kinda annoying.
totalwar,3e2069,RJ815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"There are less extensive mods that only remove Realm Divide and don't touch other diplomacy values. From looking into modding that kind of stuff myself, there is a simple way to change the Realm Divide diplomatic penalty into something else (even something positive!), but it seems like that's not actually the thing that causes the automatic declaration of war with everybody who is not your ally, and in fact I think that penalty is only responsible for making you lose your allies later since it's a growing negative penalty to cancel out any positives you have with them. The actual ""everyone declares war on you"" thing seems hidden elsewhere, which I currently have not found. But one of the more successful and easier Realm Divide modding solutions I've seen is to just change the Fame counter. There isn't really much of a benefit to it at any one of the discrete levels of Fame, only the negative of Realm Divide when it's full, so simply setting the cap at some absurdly high number means you should never hit Realm Divide because of that, though you still can hit it from attacking Kyoto (which seems fair enough IMO, and you could just wait to take it until much later if you still want to avoid Realm Divide, plus the Shogunate seems to mostly stick to its lands and doesn't go out hunting for you like other clans).  As for FotS, since it has a separate diplomatic value to change for the Realm Divide penalty, I imagine its Realm Divide stuff is separate from the vanilla stuff. I'm not sure how to change that but honestly I think it's significantly less of a problem there anyways. The clans that are the same allegiance as you should help you out when all the opposite allegiance clans declare war. Only the Republic option is full-blown Realm Divide (perhaps even harsher), but I think staying still under the same Imperial or Shogunate banner as before makes things more of a fair fight.  I'll also add that I used to really despise Realm Divide, thinking it was a potential game-ruiner. I'm a bit softer on it now, as it really only means a few extra things you have to deal with:    You probably will lose a lot of trade, but if you have sufficient farm, market, sake den upgrades, etc, that really shouldn't be a crippling loss. And it's generally a good idea to upgrade self-sufficient wealth sources rather than always relying on the more finicky trade anyways.  Having everyone declare war on you sucks, but in truth only the Strong or above clans should really be any threat to you. You should be able to beat back Moderate or below clans' stacks fairly easily. And if any clans have to go through water to get to you, careful naval planning can allow you to sink their invasion fleet before they even land, netting you a big enemy cost for a much lesser naval cost to you. Your allies do eventually betray you, but you can potentially have a fairly long time before it happens. The initial Realm Divide penalty is not that huge and grows over time, and the inherent positive bonuses in alliances and trade agreements (even without all that stuff like hostages and marriages) can offset it for quite a while, pretty much until they start dipping into ""Unfriendly"" but not yet at even Indifferent. 20 or so turns of potential breathing room can really help a lot in terms of upgrading farms to offset lost trade wealth, positioning armies better to beat back invaders or to get ready to strike betraying allies, etc. I've also found that you can still make alliances right up until 1 turn before Realm Divide, and even if they never help you in a fight your other enemies will batter them down for however many odd turns and either kill them outright or make them much softer when you eventually have to get rid of them."
totalwar,3e2069,RJ815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:48 2015 UTC,There are less extensive mods that only remove Realm Divide and don't touch other diplomacy values   where? I can't find them. There used to be some on the TW but they're not there anymore the ones that do exist don't touch FotS. Everyone says they're out there for FotS but it's really not.   I couldn't give less of a shit about how to survive realm divide.  I just want to remove it. It's not hard it's just fucking tedious. After going to war with the entire realm I couldn't give less of a shit about the 102nd shit blockading inconsequential port number 43 having to watch that animation.
