actualconspiracies,3d9jkh,confluencer,20,Tue Jul 14 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"Another perfect 300 character title count.   Key excerpts:   The report reveals that military personnel were briefed to tell any 'inquisitive inquirer' the trials were part of research projects into weather and air pollution.   ...   One chapter of the report, 'The Fluorescent Particle Trials', reveals how between 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwall along the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphide on the population. The chemical drifted miles inland, its fluorescence allowing the spread to be monitored. In another trial using zinc cadmium sulphide, a generator was towed along a road near Frome in Somerset where it spewed the chemical for an hour.  In another chapter, 'Large Area Coverage Trials', the MoD describes how between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii , which mimics anthrax. These releases came from a military ship, the Icewhale, anchored off the Dorset coast, which sprayed the micro-organisms in a five to 10-mile radius.  The report also reveals details of the DICE trials in south Dorset between 1971 and 1975. These involved US and UK military scientists spraying into the air massive quantities of serratia marcescens bacteria, with an anthrax simulant and phenol.  Similar bacteria were released in 'The Sabotage Trials' between 1952 and 1964. These were tests to determine the vulnerability of large government buildings and public transport to attack. In 1956 bacteria were released on the London Underground at lunchtime along the Northern Line between Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway. The results show that the organism dispersed about 10 miles. Similar tests were conducted in tunnels running under government buildings in Whitehall.  The MoD report traces the history of the UK's research into germ warfare since the Second World War when Porton Down produced five million cattle cakes filled with deadly anthrax spores which would have been dropped in Germany to kill their livestock. It also gives details of the infamous anthrax experiments on Gruinard on the Scottish coast which left the island so contaminated it could not be inhabited until the late 1980s.  The report also confirms the use of anthrax and other deadly germs on tests aboard ships in the Caribbean and off the Scottish coast during the 1950s. The document states: 'Tacit approval for simulant trials where the public might be exposed was strongly influenced by defence security considerations aimed obviously at restricting public knowledge. An important corollary to this was the need to avoid public alarm and disquiet about the vulnerability of the civil population to BW [biological warfare] attack.'   ...   Sue Ellison, spokeswoman for Porton Down, said: 'Independent reports by eminent scientists have shown there was no danger to public health from these releases which were carried out to protect the public.  'The results from these trials will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.'  Asked whether such tests are still being carried out, she said: 'It is not our policy to discuss ongoing research.'   CHEMTRAILS PEOPLE! THEY WERE REAL!  Well, in the sense the government pumped out relatively harmless substances in secret to avoid public scrutiny along with bio tracking markers to determine spread of the Ruskies dropping anthrax or smallpox over Britain.  Justifiable? I don't know, it was the Cold War, and we know the Ruskies had a super hard on for biowarfare and ending the human race at the Biopreparat labs (Vector and Sverdlovsk) where they were developing weaponized anthrax and smallpox designed for an ICBM MIRV launch platform (which they tested in the Pacific). MIRVs that could hit anywhere on the planet within 90 minutes as part of a mass scale extermination attack from any one of the Russian secret missile sites located all along their borders, preset to hit every major city on the planet (although no evidence of BW being widely spread, given that nukes had less, well, blowback).  This is an attack vector that would directly match these declassified tests the British MoD ran to determine vulnerability, spread and plan for quarantine, containment and encircling vaccination/treatments of a massive weaponized anthrax or smallpox payload delivered directly to civilian population centers.  It all depends on the number of possible alternative universes where the Ruskies and the West had escalated into all out war sometime over the last half century, something we can never know.  All in all, given the tests were very limited, fairly dispersed, and shortlived, I'd say it was an acceptable program. Barely.  It probably continues to this day, but via computer simulations, since we've got accurate models, from, well, tests like these."

Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory. The CIA's potential involvement was frequently mentioned during the 1960s and 1970s when the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in plots to assassinate foreign leaders, particularly Fidel Castro.   Kennedy was quoted as telling an official within his administration: ""I want to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.""  According to author James Douglass, Kennedy was assassinated because he was turning away from the Cold War and seeking a negotiated peace with the Soviet Union.   Accusations and confessions of and by alleged conspirators, as well as official government reports citing the CIA as uncooperative in investigations, have at times renewed interest in these conspiracy theories.

actualconspiracies,3cjw7n,Jasperodus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"No, they weren't unrelated. That does not mean a conspiracy, though. This isn't connect the dots. Real historical research has been done by hundreds of professionals. There is no evidence supporting a conspiracy, and believe me, any academic or journalist would absolutely love to be the first one to expose that story. It would make their career.  The truth is that the record clearly shows Lee Harvey Oswald was both willing and able to kill the president, and there's a mountain of evidence to support that he did so. Unfortunately a man who felt a deep devotion to Kennedy decided to take justice into his own hands instead of allowing the courts to prove guilt.  Robert Kennedy's assassination was not in any way directly linked to his brother's assassination. There is no evidence at all to support that. However there is a kind of indirect link - that is, the entire social situation in America during the 1960s and the Kennedys' notorious ambition and audacity.  Now, to be fair, there is a chance that Oswald received support from Cuban intelligence agents. There is no reliable evidence for this at all, but some circumstantial evidence that makes it at least plausible. It's clear, though, that Oswald was the only one pulling the trigger that day in Dallas."

Given all of history, I find it far more likely that one part of the government decided to assassinate the U.S. president rather than a 'lone gunman.' I also find the idea that Jack Ruby acted out of a ""deep devotion to Kennedy"" laughable. There's plenty of evidence and plenty of careers have been made investigating the assassination. Apparently, however, some people are so slavishly threatened by the idea that authority is not benevolent that nothing short of a dozen videotaped confessions by everyone involved in the conspiracy could get enough people to believe what they simply choose not to.   I happen to feel the same way about 9/11, but I see no point in getting into that as people tend to become extremely emotionally triggered by this issue to the point where it has become impossible to have a civil discussion about it."

The organization mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals and intellectuals. Under the leadership of Hamid Idris Awate, it engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state.  However, by 1962, the ELM had been discovered and destroyed by imperial authorities.  When Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the country in 1962, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) waged an armed struggle for independence. The ensuing Eritrean War for Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian Capital Addis Ababa.  Following a UN-supervised referendum in Eritrea (dubbed UNOVER) in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993.  The ELF seized power, established a one-party state along nationalist lines and banned further political activity. There have been no elections since (see Government and Politics).
