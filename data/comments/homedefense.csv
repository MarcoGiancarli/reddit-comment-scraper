If you're ok with having a PC running all the time, the best of the best system is Blue Iris software.  The best cameras for a decent price currently are made by Hikvision, such as the Hikvision DS-2CD2332-I.   The Cam It forum is a great place for info.  Aside from that, if you want to go for something that is cheap and not as high quality, but dead simple, a Dropcam is an easy solution.  Edit:  I had listed the wrong Hikvision camera model.  It's correct now."
homedefense,3e2e2d,thbt101,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:19 2015 UTC,I just purchased that same camera model to try out Hikvision. I'm still new to IP cameras but so far it seems Hikvision is an awesome value with 1080p. I'm going the DVR route for now because I don't have a spare PC to tie Blue Iris to since I've only got a MacBook. I've done the DVR setup before with a Samsung 960h camera system setup but everything was analog.

It's not just a 1080p camera, it's a really high quality 1080p image, even at night.  The only thing to know about them is don't try upgrading the firmware unless you're sure the one you have isn't a Chinese model one.  Actually, I would recommend just not trying to upgrade the firmware just to be safe."

The exact make and model would vary depending on the application but maybe start with the samsung wisenet lite series or hikvision, I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives to the two but atleast it gives you a place to start. If this is an indoor system with wifi access maybe see if a wireless camera (nest, arlo, etc) is what you're looking for.   For the first scenario supplies would be: - 2 cameras with sd slots -cat6 cable (make sure the runs are under 300ft) -POe switch or injector  I think this would be in the 300-500 range depending on the resources you already have available."

homedefense,3e09ed,omegis983,7,Mon Jul 20 23:29:21 2015 UTC,"IP Cameras have first to be connected to your local network (LAN) They can be plugged into a switch (a box that allows to plug multiple network devices). Pic of a switch Once connected to your LAN, an IP will be attributed to the camera.  The IP addresses range of a LAN starts with something like:  192.168.1.x (where x can go from 1 to 256, but 1 is most of the time allocated to your router that must be connected to the switch if you decide to use a switch). Once the camera is connected to your switch, you can access your IP camera in your browser by typing its IP address.  I'm not familiar with Hikvision's cameras, but the cameras I own come with a little utility that shows you the IP addresses of all the cameras that are connected to your LAN. If you connect more than one IP camera to your switch, they will each have a different IP address and a port.  For example, one of my cameras can be accessed locally through http://192.169.1.50:8050.  The IP and port can usually set to be fixed in each camera settings panel.  I recommend doing so because you want to access the cameras from the outside. If you want to access your camera from the outside, you won't be able to use its local IP.  First, you will have to allow your router to be accessed from the outside. You might also have to allow your router to route the camera IP and port to be accessible from the outside as well (it depends from router to router). When your router IP can be accessed from the outside, you will have to know your IP address (the one that your ISP is giving you).  This can be a problem if your router restarts and your IP changes.   The way to remedy this is by using a DNS service (I use DynDNS, it's cheap).  A DNS service will allow you to have an address such as ""name.dyndns.org"".  You camera should have a way to use a DNS service. Let's say it does allow you to use a DNS service.  You enter your new DNS address, username and password in the camera settings panel.  Once done (and if your router is set to be accessed from the outside), all you will have to do to access your camera from the outside is to type ""name.dyndns.org:x"" where x is the port number of your camera. If you have several cameras, then each camera must have a different port number.  You set the same DNS settings on each camera, and then you can access each of the cameras using the ""name.dyndns.org:x"", changing x for the port number of the camera you want to access. If you want to use a DVR, you will have to own a DVR that is compatible with IP cameras, and that can be plugged into a switch.  I'm not familiar with such DVR.  I use a dedicated computer that is connected to my LAN as a DVR. Now, if your cameras are spread around your house, you will have to connect them to a cat5e or cat6 cable (network cable) and a power cord.  This can be a problem if you don't have a power outlet near where you want to plug the camera.  The solution is to use a POE (Power Over Ethernet) switch. A POE switch sends power through the network cable the camera is connected to.  I recommend using a POE switch since your Hikvision camera is POE capable.   Let me know if you need more help."
homedefense,3e09ed,zeeshopper,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:01 2015 UTC,That's a lot of good info and it should help me get started. I'll start looking at the POE switch
homedefense,3e09ed,HyperspaceCatnip,4,Tue Jul 21 01:02:29 2015 UTC,"To add to /u/zeeshopper's info, I can expand a little on DVRs, and the networking in general.   A lot of DVRs will be tied to the camera hardware. For example, you'll have most luck getting a dedicated Hikvision DVR if you're going to use Hikvision cameras. This is due to subtle differences in video encoding software and configuration, and happens even if everything is ONVIF compliant (one of the ""standards"" for IP camera interoperability) High end DVRs (sometimes they're just a pre-configured PC, sometimes they're still a dedicated box) will often support every camera you can throw at it, but will cost a lot more. Though you can plug the cameras into your LAN, from a security standpoint you may wish to avoid this - each camera is actually then a security hole if someone were to grab the ethernet coming to it. In my house, some of the cameras are low enough that this could be a problem (and in one case, is even approachable from behind), so some installs will keep a separate LAN just for the security system (it also makes sense if it works both ways, and can't see the internet) I have a Hikvision DVR which includes 8 PoE ports, so it has the switch built in. Thus, I get the ""separate LAN"" thing for free. Mostly the built in PoE functionality makes the wiring simpler, though ;) Independent PoE-enabled switches were super expensive last I checked. These are devices where a number of ports out of the whole switch provide PoE (generally it's not every port, as at least one will be the ""upstream"" link to the network). The other device /u/zeeshopper links to is some sort of inbetween injector - it's not a switch, but it is ""proper"" PoE and so is fine. I assume the cost is somewhere in the middle (this is probably because ""full"" PoE is actively negotiated, the PoE switch/injector actually communicates with the device at the other end to decide whether to enable PoE, so some intelligence is required in the box) Avoid ""passive PoE"" at all costs. It's non-standard and it won't work with the PoE already built into your camera, so it'd still have the weird wire dongle at the camera end."
homedefense,3e09ed,HyperspaceCatnip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"So another thing I'm looking at, in case the NVR doesn't work, is attaching an external hard drive to my Airport Extreme and pointing the Hikvision iVMS-4200 software at it. That'll be a learning experience but it seems somewhat cost effective, if I can pull it off, than tying to a NVR. If I go that route, that'd mean I'd need a POE switch, which as you've pointed out, can be pricey.   Even though I'd like to live view what my cameras are seeing like I currently do with my Samsung setup, it's not entirely necessary. The major goal is to have the camera recording download to local storage in case I need to scan through it later on.   I also plan to mount my cameras fairly high. My Samsung bullets are around 15-20ft high right now and cover a good area but I'm basically getting 480p quality. I want to upgrade that so I can eventually dump my Dropcams on eBay.   Because I'm genuinely interested, what Hikvision NVR are you using? And if I go the NVR route, would I need to connect the power adapter near the camera or would using POE cover the power requirements through cat5 cable from the NVR?"
homedefense,3e09ed,zeeshopper,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is the one I have, though mine is missing the alarm header for some reason (the software also says ""no alarms"" when you go into that page). It doesn't say anywhere on it but it appears to be a Hikvision - it works with the iVMS software I've used on iOS and OSX.  With a PoE switch or NVR, all you'll need is cat5 from the back of the unit to your camera, no other wiring necessary - I currently have three Hikvision cameras (one Hikvision branded, two Swann branded) running on it, along with a couple of non-PoE TP-Link cameras, they're powered using a PoE splitter so the single wire can still power them. It was pretty handy for some of the more fiddly wiring in the eaves of my house, I'd hate to have had to run two cables. Not to mention the UPS is where the NVR is, so the cameras keep running when the main power fails ;)"

homedefense,3dvh57,xxjsonxx91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"Hi Furyburner, it seems like you have a huge private property - many doors, and windows - I would suggest having sensors on each door. And motion detection within the proximity of the windows. The actual positioning and number of sensors would be better planned by you because you understand your property.  Honeywell systems do generally require a dealer to activate / install the system.   Z-Wave Smart Home Systems may be a great choice for you.  You can activate -> arm / disarm from your phone / iPad / Computer and get notifications (if you have internet router?). There's many other devices you can add to control, secure, and track usage records. Your lights, power outlets, garage, and pretty much everything else you can think of. On the security side you can control your door locks, motion sensors, door window sensors and receive notifications, set them to trigger an alarm or lights, its very customizeable.    I currently work for www.statis-online.com (we specialize in home automation and security :] ) - I could help you understand the options better.   I just want to clarify that you have two things in that property: 1. Internet Connection 2. Electricity  If you have those you can set up your own Z-Wave system.   You can add as many motion sensors, door/window sensors, energy switches, light dimmers, LED Colored lightbulbs, and more - control them all remotely.  You can control your entire system via your phone, iPad, or computer (as long as you have internet).     Many of the motion sensors are 4in1 - they detect temperature, light levels, vibrations (earthquake), and of course motion. Some detect UV rays (harmful light), and etc along with everything else.   There are flood / water leak sensors so you can detect water damage before it happens. It also has a temperature sensor that detects even minor changes in temperature. You will know if there is a fire starting somewhere.  The Z-Wave system is very affordable, easy to setup and the whole system usually only takes minutes to set up. All devices are wireless. Most run on battery(1-2 Years battery life), some connect to power outlet. Your gateway (The control center) will be plugged into a power outlet next to your internet router. Basically Gateway + Devices = Your system.  We have an intro to Smart Home system here http://www.statis-online.com/home-automation/getting-started  You can take a look at some of the user interfaces that the different gateways have. Oh and I'm not sure if I said this before - no monthly fees. 0 monthly fees. You can control your system without paying a monthly fee.    In terms of home security however - I have to say security cameras are more effective. The thing is let's say a criminal passes by your property - he will think there's nobody in it. He doesn't know that you have a security system in the house and he might just try to break in. Visible Security cameras generally scare the criminal and they are less likely to attempt a break-in when you have them. You can live view the video at anytime from your phone as well. It will also have recording capability. http://www.statis-online.com/zmodo-4-channel-4-camera-indoor-outdoor-high-definition-security-system-2211.html (720P HD 4 Camera System)  Oh and another thing - with a z-wave system you can schedule your lights to turn on at specific times - or random intervals. This is great when you're out of the house because a criminal may think there are people in the home and not try to break-in.  While the sensors system are great to alert you when the break-in happens - it's a lot better to prevent the break-in as well.   The security cameras do require you to install them, but it can probably be done within a couple of hours.  We have a guide to home security here http://www.statis-online.com/home-security  If you have any questions about what's best for your home feel free to email me! JasonC@statis-online.com"

Primarily if you're not home and want to catch what's going on inside your house.

However, they might steal the camera too, and I don't think those back up wirelessly. If they're not going to break into the car, this is a good idea.  Alternatively, hide the camera somewhere behind the car so that even if they trash the car, it's on tape and safe.  Alternatively alternatively, put a plasic box or old, broken webcam on the dash labelled ""DASH CAMERA"" to deter simple keying and headlight-smashing vandals, and put the 808 to watch them steal the DASH cam.

If cloud and willing to pay, one of the more economical options is finding a camera that can record to a Google Drive. Canary has a 90 day storage plan for $40.00 per month but it would be hard to hide it though Canary doesn't look like a regular security camera. Which brings me to my next question. Do you really need to hide the camera if you record to the cloud?"

Also, they just pushed an update that allows you to download footage locally from the cloud. If you don'd mind cameras that record to Google Drive but recording to Google breaks up the footage and it's really disorganized. Coming home to shift through 90 days of Google Drive video would be a nightmare. As a side note, you may want to checkout Camio.

The IR attracts insect, which are dinner for spiders, so the spider sets up a web in an insect high-traffic zone, which is right in front of your camera.  You'll never win this battle, not with sprays, deterrents, etc.  Disable the on-board IR and get a decent external illuminator.

The reality is that the cost/benefit ratio for them is completely fucked. They are too expensive and offer far too little benefit even on very large installs.   And facial recognition for CCTV is damn near non-existent. The angles of placement generally require angles and fields of view that are prohibitive. You see academic papers on the subject and you see facial recognition for things where the camera will be aimed dead on at the face, like cellphones.

homedefense,3d65xc,thomamelas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"Probably the smart automation of access and automatic notifications of intruders will be the big change by 2035. This will be done by analyzing our behavior patterns and relationships.   By this, I mean that you come home with a friend, the friend might be allowed automatic access to the front door when you're home, but it remains locked while you're gone. Your friend can't open your bedroom door, but can access the back patio, bathroom, ect. You won't program any of this, the system just watches your behavior and figures out your relationship to that person. Maybe your friend stays the night and then they're allowed to access more rooms. Maybe your mudroom will automatically unlock for the Fedex guy. If your gardener comes by and starts helping himself to the refrigerator, it sends you a notification. Unrecognized person looking in the window while you're at work? The system contacts police, and will notify other homes in the area. Physical non-integrated locks will still exists, but I think they'll be pointless considering how adopted the IoT will be by then. So, instead of being passive monitoring, it will be an active, thinking and reacting system.   Of course, all of this will be on the cloud, too.   This level of monitoring is pretty fascinating. Microsoft has a vision of the future where the ""smart home"" monitors everything about your life style, and is rapidly building this into reality using Xbox Connect prototypes. An example of this would be your computer/home aware of what's in your refrigerator, what cooking equipment you have, then suggest recipes and offer to re-purchase your food and have it delivered. ""Your milk has expired, would you like me to order more? Here's some substitutes for dinner tonight.""

homedefense,3cv5hd,thomamelas,2,Sat Jul 11 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of things from a CCTV perspective. It's used in other situations without much of an issue but for CCTV it has some problems. It was originally adopted to give analog manufacturers a way to compete with IP cameras. But it was released rather late and a lot of the manufacturers who might have adopted it moved on to CCTV. So it never had wide adoption. It also was expensive. One of the main competitive advantages analog had was that it was cheap and HD-SDI pissed that way.   Then it threw away one of the other major advantages of analog. There was a kind of small fork in the standard. The HDCCTV variation of it wasn't completely compatible with HD-SDI but the HDCCTV alliance was the main marketing group. So that caused some problems.   And now as far as CCTV goes, it's an orphaned standard. The HDCCTV alliance basically is now Dahua and pushing Dahua's HD-CVI technology. Which is much cheaper and honestly better for CCTV then HD-SDI is. And Hikvision is competing with their HD-TVI standard which is also much cheaper then HD-SDI was."
homedefense,3ct4ed,the_loneliest_noodle,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:33 2015 UTC,Simple DVR CCTV systems I think are quite cheap (and have fallen out of favour). Decent NVRs capable of simultaneous 16 HD channel recording/motion detection are more pricey.

homedefense,3coo4s,Urschleim_in_Silicon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"Combined with the element of surprise, this kind of attack is almost impossible to defend against.   Its not impossible if you take any type of security measures like many posters here do. Lock your doors, even when you are awake, and lock your windows. Force people to make noise to get into your house. This will ruin their element of surprise. Keep spare ammo, and maybe even two guns if you have too.  Generally speaking people like this are looking for an easy thrill. If you make it any bit more difficult than normal they will probably quite and look for the next poor sap.  but a handgun in the night stand wouldn't cut it.  There is plenty of ammo in a handgun, and having extra ammo isn't all that hard."

Window security film  Are there any windows on or near your entry doors that could be used to unlock the door?  pauly_pants has already mentioned reinforced frame/door jamb.  Do you have bushes or other concealment outside your house?  Does your back yard fence conceal people from your neighbors?  Security cameras recording motion locally and uploading to cloud?  Home security plan established and discussed with members of your household?  Do you have french doors or a sliding glass door?
homedefense,3cp3at,smoothie2u,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:40:53 2015 UTC,Sliding glass door. That is def a weak point. And security film sounds awesome. Do you know a good place? Security cameras are a good idea! All the other stuff I'm gtg
homedefense,3cp3at,AdanClinton,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"I would add:  1) Security Cameras  2) Window Film  3) Rolling Security Shutters if you want to spend lots of money but have your home closer to a fortress.  These are the basic HD 1080p 30fps or 3MP 20fps cameras @ around $160 a piece. Network based. You can run Milestone Xprotect Go for free on your PC with up to 8 cameras and 5 days of video storage. You can also manually copy video files to long term storage beyond the 5 day duration. http://wrightwoodsurveillance.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_16&products_id=312  Security film comes in many varieties and either professional install or self install. Seems like $1500 for 100ft roll which will cover several windows and sliding glass doors, you would need to measure your windows and doors for a more accurate idea of how much you would need. https://www.diywindowsecurity.com/  And finally security shutters if you want the ultimate in home security without tearing down and rebuilding a purpose built home. Don't know what these cost but I can't imagine they are anything but expensive. http://roll-a-way.com/  I am not a big fan of Schlage/Kwikset locks, I find they give a false sense of security. Look on youtube about picking or bumping locks and it is quite an eye opener. I would suggest higher security locks such as the Abloy Protec & Protec2, the BiLock, or the EVVA. These locks are significantly more expensive but are worth it imho. Check out https://securitysnobs.com/ for the various high security locks I mentioned.  And finally if you really want to spend some money look at http://mastersecuritydoors.com/ which are high security doors. These doors are very very strong indeed."

Assuming he's scoped the place out for your absence during normal work hours, consider changing something obvious about the exterior of the house. Move patio chairs around, etc., and generally create an air of uncertainty for him.

If you know how to use one, then you and your parents might want to weigh the risks of you somehow hurting yourself or someone else with a gun vs. the risk of someone breaking in while you are home alone. It might be worth getting the gun out, but then again, I don't know you.  However, if you've never used one before, then using one for the first time during a break-in probably isn't the way to go."

homedefense,3clwkp,renegade2point0,3,Thu Jul 9 20:01:34 2015 UTC,So if they are scoping your place it sounds like they want a b&e when you're not home and they want to avoid a home invasion.  That being said don't open the door for them.  You can engage them and if they don't go away keep moving around while on the phone with the police.  The other info here is really good too.
homedefense,3clwkp,Justagreewithme,-12,Thu Jul 9 11:15:44 2015 UTC,"I realize this sub, by nature, assumes a more ""better to be safe than sorry"" attitude than most, but sometimes I think you all are paranoid.  First, you are not about to be robbed.  You are most likely thinking burglarized, if anything.  Secondly, yes, it could be a burglar but it most likely isn't.  I work for local police and get these calls all the time.  The vast vast vast majority of the time, the person is trying to contact you for a legitimate reason.  Out of curiosity, what do you have to gain by not answering the door?  If anything, by not answering it you have made yourself more of a threat.  If it was the rare burglar, he now thinks the home is empty and ripe for picking.  I'm not saying open the door to a stranger, you can talk through a locked door, ask him what he wants, who he is etc.  you now have a better look/description of him and if he did have ill intent, know that the house is not empty or vulnerable."
homedefense,3clwkp,GP_Level_0100,5,Thu Jul 9 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"What are you doing in this sub? There's a line between paranoid and prepared. If someone comes to my door I often don't answer for reasons of convenience and annoyance. It's reasonable to assume people that come on your property uninvited need to be taken seriously.

Calling police just because someone knocked on your door is being paranoid.  Knocking on a door is a socially acceptable way of contacting someone.  Sure, if it's an odd hour or the person looks crazy/is shouting, call the police.  I bring this up not to be mean, but because doing so will likely have the opposite affect of what you are looking for.  It will increase police response times for future calls.  We receive a litany of calls from people afraid to answer their door just to find out it's their boyfriend they just invited over, the pizza they just ordered, their paper boy looking for payment, a licensed solicitor selling their wares, school child doing a fund raiser etc.  I suggest someone get a locking screen door. That way you can safely crack open the front door and ask the person who they are and what they want."

homedefense,3cl3r3,jlboygenius,7,Wed Jul 8 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Just a couple things that I'd like to point out being a previous burglar in another life. You said people breaking into houses don't know value. That's not true as most will know what has value and what they can resell easily.   Home invasions happen fast. Your best defense is hiding things where no one would think to look for them. The cabinet behind the painting is one of those places. Thieves don't have time to try and look for secret locations and hidden areas.   The gun thing is a personal choice, but if you do decide to eventually get one there are plenty options of hiding it near you bedside/desk/couch that conceals the gun and makes it invisible to any burglar. You could also get your concealed carry and never leave your handgun at home.   But a big point you hit is street visibility. Houses that are out in the open and have good lighting are way too intimidating for most home invaders. I would never go near that shit.  Sorry you got broken into but at least you can improve your methods and make sure it doesn't happen again."
homedefense,3cl3r3,Minatorious,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:15:05 2015 UTC,My house is pretty private in the back yard. There isn't much I can do about that.

homedefense,3cm6pu,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"hey! I'm interested in a similar setup. So to clarify, you connect the cameras directly to the POE port using ethernet cable. The POE port is plugged into a wall outlet. After that stage I am confused -- how do you connect the POE to the router? Can I connect it to one wireless router that is then connected to another wireless router? I don't have a wired home network, but can manage to get the ethernet cables to the POE port, but not sure what to do after that. Why do you need a switch? Thanks!"
homedefense,3cm6pu,meowmixpurr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"From the camera you run an ethernet cable to the POE device and then coming out the other side of that device is another ethernet cable that goes to a switch or router.  I'm not an expert in networking so someone feel free to correct me.  A switch is basically a dumb router, it just provides more ethernet ports for your router.  If you already have an extra wireless router and it has enough ports for your cameras, you can set it up as bridge to your main router. or if you have more cameras than ports you can buy a switch and connect that to a wireless access point so the cameras can connect to the rest of your network."

I think I might just go for your exact configuration - those same Hikvison cameras with ethernet cables going into attic, and the same POE device plugged into an outlet in my attic. Then ethernet cable from the POE device into a wireless router in my attic, and then the wireless router will connect to other wireless routers in the house.  The only issue is if I use your cameras it looks like I will need to run my own server? So I'm just searching for something that can stream directly without me needing to run a server myself? maybe something like homemonitor.me?"

Shitty cameras are just annoying; and if you want 8 of them, even at $50 ea, which is not a high quality camera, that's already burned up 40% of your budget. Long wire runs are expensive; and outdoor-rated cable is expensive."
homedefense,3cmbg6,Ghiizhar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, your budget is nowhere near adequate. Consider building your system in phases. Protect your residence first with something like a $99 Livewatch.com system ($20-$40/mo monitoring fee - one year term, return for refund anytime during first year). If you want police dispatch, you will need a professional monitoring service such as Livewatch provides via Alarm.com.  For cameras, start with a small self installed system. Get a couple of Hikvision or similar bullet cameras like the Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I. Put them in the most strategic locations. If you have an existing PC, use it w/Blue Iris (BI)software to monitor the cameras, otherwise buy an inexpensive PC. BI has an iOS app. I personally use Sighthound Pro, but that's an additional $250.  Camera software generates a lot of false alarms. I use my Livewatch QOLsys system to send/sound alarms, dispatch police; and my cameras to see what's going on. Cameras are not integrated/monitored by Livewatch (Alarm.com) - as I said, too many false alarms would be generated.  If someone is going to burglarize you, they will more than likely enter your residence. Livewatch will cover that - police will be dispatched. The cameras will collect the video evidence (make sure they record the videos to a concealed storage device). As time and budget permit, expand your system to cover the outbuildings.   I recently purchased 2 Arlo wireless cameras to cover areas that I do not have wired. They only capture video upon detecting motion, and they can only store video in the Arlo cloud. They perform quite well, and notify me of any motion detections in their coverage area. They also are not monitored by Livewatch. Downside, cost was $350!  Bottom line, get something ASAP if you are in a high-risk area, and build it out as time and budget permits.  I am a complete amateur, but this is the method I chose and it works well for me. YMMV!"

Everything is DIY essentially and the price tag is about $1200. Using 4x Hikvision 2032's and a purpose built linux server for motion detection/video recording using zoneminder. Also needed to get a bunch of CAT5E cable, a tool to work with that cable, and a POE injector/network switch. To extend it to an 8 camera system would probably have been another $300 invested in the computer (faster processor, more storage) and networking equipment (larger switch/poe injector, more cable) and another $450 in cameras.

In night mode, the cameras typically switch to greyscale or a variation thereof. A way around it would to either put up motion detecting lights out front and disabling night vision altogether or set up an IR illuminator outside while disabling the IR leds on the camera.

It's how it's installed and reinforced and locked is where you want to look into. A solid deadbolt is definitely stronger than a hollow one. But, when locked, the deadbolt typically only goes into the first piece of the doorframe. Reinforced steel strips spanning a couple of feet helps tremendously. Additionally, there are ""cupped"" deadbolt receivers that typically include much longer screws to tie in the next stud of the house as well. On the other side, the hinges should be of substantial size versus the run of the mill. Else, adding more hinges spreads the load across them. I'd consider longer screws on that side as well. From the depths of my paranoia, keys with more tumblers are harder to pick, not by much but can add valuable seconds to someone trying to break in. A loon like me rekeys my locks every few years. You can find rekeying kits on fleabay - they're usually sold to landlords. Hope this helps."

Even before remote locks, it became habit/routine for me to lock the door manually with the key every time I shut it.  When I shut my house doors, I don't do so with the knob, I do it with my hand on the deadbolt, and by habit turn the deadbolt immediately as I shut the door. Every time I shut the door from the outside, my key is in my hand and I lock the deadbolt immediately as it closes.  It helps these routines to never leave doors unlocked, even if it's less convenient that way.

Even replacing them myself with wrecking yard windows cost more than the stuff they stole.   The last time I kept more than 80 cents in my car was my subaru station wagon, it had a nice large bin in the center console ahead of the shifter. Probably had $20 or so in change in it at any given time. One morning I got up to go to work, the car was parked at the sidewalk. I walked around to the driver side, and got in, only to find a young black boy around 13 sitting in the passenger seat with his hand in the console stealing the coins. He looked terrified so I yelled BOO. He ran. That day at work I grabbed the x-acto trash bin (worked for a publishing house who still did manual paste up) and then dumped the discarded x-acto blades into the change.   I only ever got broke into one more time in that car and found a handful of coins and blades on the passenger floor. I then used a magnet to remove all the blades and took the coins out of the car."

Add an alarm system, reinforce your strike plate on your door jamb, upgrade your locks, use long screws for your hinges, install security film to your windows, add cameras, get a loud or yappy dog, and keep an effective means of protection available at a moment's notice.

homedefense,3bmm6x,TabbyCaterpillar,2,Tue Jun 30 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"Simplisafe runs in home or away mode when you turn it on. The home mode is everything but the motion sensors on.  If you want to be at home and have the alarm still cover all access points, then you would want to double down on placing entry sensors in rooms that have motion sensor coverage. Generally you wouldn't need entry\glass break sensors in rooms that have motion sensor coverage.  Glass break sensors are great (took them long enough to add them) in that not every home invasion would involve someone unlocking a window to gain entry; they may just smash it with something and crawl in. I would opt to have glass break sensor coverage in as much of the house as possible in light of that.  I would also add that I showed in the good area of the T-mobile coverage map that they provided. I still had to use my land line as I could not get the system to connect wirelessly. Just because you show as having good coverage on the map doesn't mean that your home will afford you that same assumed quality. It's nice to have a backup landline just in case."

Don't go with Big corporate companies like ADT or vivent (especially vivent) because you will pay a lot more than you need to. Find a small local business and see what kind of deals they have. A small company like that is normally better for service and stuff like at if a battery or wire needs replaced. Also a local company can be a lot cheaper than the big ones. Instead of paying $50 plus a month to the big guys you can pay al ost half that to the smaller ones. Make sure they are local though.

Ok, now that that's out of my system, understand thieves are GOING to steal from someone. All you need to do is make your house more of a hassle than the next house over.   So what does that mean? Make it take longer to get in so the crook is exposed. Make their exposure obvious,   Cheapest starters- secure door hardware with 3"" screws. The screws that come with hinges are usually pretty short (but you know that since you have 4k worth ;) ) replace the hinge and deadbolt screws with nice meaty long ones on every exterior door.     Windows- get better locks then the cheap plastic ones they come with. They can break the glass, but we'll get there.    If you can afford it, get a solid, heavy door. Metal ones are great, solid wood are great too. All the hardware in the world won't help if the door folds like a taco.  Expose the crook- Lighting. Lighting everywhere. Motion lights are great, but I like to just keep my exterior lighting burning all night. LED bulbs, so who cares.    Remove shrubs and trees that block view of the doors and windows from the street.   That will maximize the potential time they are exposed while attempting to enter your house.  Alarms-    Get a professional opinion on this.  I am not one. Door and motion sensors are pretty standard. Use the alarm, even though it's a pain in the ass. Advertise that you have an alarm.   Cameras-    Maybe, I'm less convinced they would be helpful. Most of the criminal element in my neighborhood looks similar enough to be of little use and none of them are going to eat each other out assuming the cops even took the time to try.

Do all the things PincersofPower recommended too.  Is your backyard fully fenced?  Put a padlock on the gate so they have to jump the fence to get back there.

You're correct they could just go to a window, and you could do window film, or thorny bushes to try to deter, if it looks too hard maybe they move on.  Easier to kick in a door, run in grab stuff and run out than climb in/out of a window while holding stuff you're stealing.  A lot easier to walk through a gate with a laptop, than it is to climb over the fence while holding a laptop.  It's smash and grab defense.

homedefense,3bkwzg,redditia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes.  This is from popcenter.org, University at Albany:  Houses previously burglarized. Such houses have a much higher risk of being burglarized than those never burglarized, partly because the factors that make them vulnerable once, such as occupancy or location, are difficult to change. Compared with non-burglarized houses, those previously targeted are up to four times more likely to be burglarized; any subsequent burglary is most likely to occur within six weeks of the initial crime.21 There are a variety of reasons suggested for revictimization: some houses offer cues of a good payoff or easy access; burglars return to houses for property left behind during the initial burglary; or burglars tell others about desirable houses.22 Burglars may also return to a target months later, to steal property the owners have presumably replaced through insurance proceeds.23 Numerous studies show that revictimization is most concentrated in lower-income areas, where burglaries are the most numerous.24 Houses near burglarized houses. Such houses face an increased risk of burglary after the neighbor is burglarized.25 Offenders may return to the area of a successful burglary and, if the previous target has been hardened, select another house, or they may seek similar property in a nearby house."

homedefense,3bihar,BimmyLee27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"That switch is NOT gigabit. There's a $35 price difference between the 100mbit and gigabit switches. Go for the gigabit switch since it's only $35 more than the 100mbit switch. Edit: It seems that it's impossible to link to the Gigabit version of the switch (thanks Amazon). That switch will be fine.  Also, you will NOT get any support from Hikvision if those cameras are defective. You'll have to ask the seller for a replacement."
homedefense,3bihar,LurkersWillLurk,3,Mon Jun 29 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter if the switch is gigabit because the cameras aren't.  Unless you have a ton of cameras, 100Mbps should be plenty."

homedefense,3bihar,hkr,3,Mon Jun 29 17:45:46 2015 UTC,"That all depends on how you configure the Cameras.  I used this calculator.  A single 3mp camera at 10 FPS will use about 3.5 Mbps.  Let's round it to 5 Mbps to be safe.  So, with 4 cameras, you would be looking at 20Mbps.  You shouldn't notice any network slow down at that point. It also depends on how much data your switch can handle.  Just because each port is 100Mbps does not mean the switch can take a constant full 100Mbps from each port at the same time.  I wouldn't worry until you get up to 10+ cameras.  But of course the best practice would be to Isolate the cameras on their own network."

homedefense,3bihar,Mark7A,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:48:43 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  Idealy, you would want to configure a second network at your primary router, which would then go into the switch.  But, you could use a second switch that branches into it's own network, and then connects to your primary.  That switch would need to be more advanced and be able to assign DHCP.  You could also just have all your IP cameras, and only the IP Cameras connected tot a second switch within your network, keeping them off your primary switch.  /u/bedsuavekid explained it a bit here.  There a a bunch of ways you could do it.  I have a completely separate network, on it's own VLAN and with a dedicated NIC."

How much of a problem that is depends on how you design your network topology.  Basically my home routers splits to two gigabit switches. One feeds all the computers in the house, and the wifi. The other is just the cameras, the BlueIris server, and the video backup NAS.  By doing that, the heavy camera traffic never travels into the rest of the home network at all, and the server can still send video out to my phone when necessary.  Think of it like a family tree. Keep all of that shit on one branch on one side, and the rest of the tree will function just as quickly as it should."

I suggest you use BlueIris's direct-to-disk mode, otherwise your CPU is going to sweat encoding all of that HD video in real-time.

homedefense,3bihar,bedsuavekid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"The dome camera is harder to mount on a vertical wall, I had to make my own brackets, the design is intended for ceilings ie with the dome hanging down. By comparison, the bullet camera can be stuck on a wall much easier.  However, the advantage of the dome is that you cannot easily tell which direction the camera is pointing in, so it's harder for an intruder to try to plot a route in.  As to the difference between the cameras, I'm not sure there is one in terms of what it can do. I think the 2332 is the newer design. The 2132 had problems with IR light reflecting inside the dome and showing up in the image as a ring of dots - not all of them, mind you, I had this problem on 1 out of 8 cameras. I solved it by adding an external IR illuminator.  The new design solves the problem by replacing the circles of IR LEDs with a single powerful emitter, moving the lens to the side of it, and removing the dome cover to kill even the possibility of reflection. Plus side? Better night image. Down side? You lost the vandal-proof dome. So, there's advantages on both sides.  I have read that the ring reflection problem occurs more readily on the 2.8mm models, but I can't confirm from personal experience, because the majority of mine are 4mm. Hope that helps."

OP probably already has a PC to use as a server. A BlueIris license is $59 last I checked, and it's pretty powerful.   Second, privacy. While I enjoy and admire Hikvision's devices, I'd never willingly give one direct access to the Internet. I guess its about who you trust, and I don't trust a company that forces me to use a service located in China in order to view video on my phone. That's something my server should be able to do. I have no way of confirming that BlueIris is any safer in this regard as its a closed source app, but certainly, given the way its configured, it feels a lot safer."

homedefense,3bhbjq,dh405,2,Wed Jul 1 07:23:15 2015 UTC,There are areas where Hik's stuff falls short. Axis's VMD 2.1 and 3 are absolutely fantastic for improving the quality and accuracy of motion detection. There are other things too. Hik's adaptive IR is noticeable worse then most other implementations of adaptive IR. Head to head comparisons generally show more noise in Hik's image at night. Generally during the day you'll see small improvements with other manufacturers in the ability to see detail. For projects with LPR that makes a world of difference for accuracy. And then you have their firmware issues. Thankfully they've finally stopped leaving telenet open.    Hikvision's stuff is good enough for a lot of use cases. For the DIY crowd it's great. For smaller camera count systems it's fine.  It's not as good as the high end pro stuff in a lot of areas. I'm not trying to convince people to go out and buy those cameras. I'm pretty sure all but a few specialized suggestions I've made in this subreddit have been for Hikvision or Dahua.   But I don't want people drawing false equivalence.

The other (master) code is used to arm and disarm it, etc.  You can use the installer code to reset the master code as well.  Here's a praphrase I found on the web:   First: unplug the battery, then disconnect AC power.  Restore AC Power  Within 50 seconds press * + # at the same time. It should come up with ""20"" showing in the display.  Press #20. The system will read back the installer code, one digit at a time (ignore leading zeros)  Write that number down.  To change the entry delay: Enter *35 enter your desired delay time in seconds (up to 99)  Disable the dialer: 41 42 94  *99 to exit programming.  Set a new master user code:  [installer code] + 8 + 02 + [new master code]  Test the new master code by turning on and off the chime feature.

If you can move the camera, or add a camera off axis so it is not pointing due South, that would also help.  I'm kinda thinking about the garage.  As weird as it sounds, putting in a walkway, and landscaping will help.  This would allow you to funnel people to a smaller location, moving them so the sun is not on their back."

homedefense,3b8iqr,EndorphinRush,2,Fri Jun 26 21:27:11 2015 UTC,Just a tip.   Pay attention to your wireless coverage before you pull the trigger on wireless. Assuming the 10000sqft you gave is square you'll have 100ft walls. 2.4ghz effective range is about 150ft. That's with little to no obstructions. If it is truly a warehouse style building I would assume it would be metal. This of course may not be true but if it is metal can seriously hamper that signal. Not saying it's not possible but just something to pay attention to.  Good luck!

If you want an ip camera, buy one camera that fits your budget and buy some cat 6 cable (i bought 1000' for $149) and you can also pick almost any color you can think of. Or if you will never possibly need 1000' for the rest of your life you could just goto a computer stop and buy a specific length. Then you get a basic poe injector or poe switch (dirt cheap) and use an old computer to run blue iris which iirc is free with only one camera.  Cctv systems are not cheap. Even when you DIY."

I get a weird feeling that something is not right and partially close the front door so he can't look into my house.  I ended up calling the cell phone of the officer that was assigned to our neighborhood's watch program and spoke to him.  Cop immediately drives over and speaks to the kid who seems to really be stammering and nervous.

Deadbolt, yes or no.  Height of the side fences.  Alarm company sign in the front yard, yes or no.  Home alarm, yes or no.  Retired or at-home resident, yes or no.

The most extreme example I have seen of these traps is a factory with rows of razor wire coil against the inside wall under the windows. A burglar breaking in is wrong, but leaving traps out to injure or kill is worse and probably legally negligent.  I suggest preventative anticlimbing methods. A wall with anticlimb grease (thick grease colored like paint), or a topper that is noisy and difficult to climb. A common wall topper is vertical metal poles, 1 foot to 4 foot high, too close together to put feet into and slick or greased.

If they really want to, they will. But why go after your place when your neighbor's place is much less secure?  Also: File a police report (I assume you already have). Report the suspicious car, every time you see it. If the police increase patrols in your area, that will help.  Talk to your apartment manager. Do they already have a security service? Are they willing to walk the grounds every hour or so and keep an eye on things?  Talk to people in your complex that are home during the day. See if they'd be willing to keep an eye out and report suspicious activity.  From what I've gathered, burglars tend to scout out an area, hit the easy targets, then move to the next area. It could be that they are already moving on. If not, you could take drastic (free) measures such as:    temporarily put your valuables in storage (electronics, etc.) for a week or two. Take time off work (I know Germany has awesome vacation benefits for employees) or work from home, if possible. Consider an actual IP camera or the like that will alert you when motion is detected. (Drastic in the sense that you didn't want to spend money. How much is your time/values worth? Maybe spending some money to protect it is a worthwhile investment ...) Plan on getting robbed. Get good renters insurance, get all the serial numbers of your devices and then be ready to file a claim when your stuff gets stolen. For family heirlooms/irreplaceable things, consider moving them off-site to storage or with trusted friends, etc."

The little dog is the alarm - they bark at everything.  The big dog does the biting.  Anti-shatter coating for the windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPQOEMtiUZc  Make sure there are several mechanisms for locking all the windows, and that they can't be lifted out of their frames.  Same with sliding glass doors.  Reinforce the door frame and get a very good lock and lockable deadbolt.  It should go about 1 inch (not sure on metric) into the door-frame.  Most burglars try to kick in the door, so make it as tough as possible - solid wood with steel reinforcing.  You could try something like this: http://www.ironhammer.net/wp-content/themes/ironhammer/images/doors/security-storm-door-02-lg.jpg  It's good because you can get a breeze while still being secure, and there being 2 doors it takes longer to get in.  Make sure your garage can't be broken into easily (panels are easy to kick in, same with windows), and make sure that there aren't ladders or sledgehammers lying around.  Also make sure that there is more than just drywall between the garage and the house.

This bothers me.   I am pretty safe in the second floor, I can lock myself in my room and be done with this. I have a good 200kg to put behind the door in just a few seconds and breaking in would be a shore foi the guy, at least. I have my knife here also, and that's enough to put someone down just in case. I don't have a gun but I'm not afraid of them either. I have nothing of value in my house, I'm far from rich, and a lot of tech stuff that would be immediately stolen would make the guy angry afterwards, because most of it is in bad shape... If I can avoid someone, I will, but if not and I face someone, even if the guy is pointing a gun at me, I'm going to piss the guy off, because I'd rather be shot then be put through the stress of someone being in my house without my knowledge.   During the day I have a dog here at home, a bulldog, but not at night. I would like to get cameras and have been checking foscam, but I'm not sure if they're the right tool for the job...

Check out this page to compare, http://24-7-home-security.com/compare-the-best-home-automation-products/#bulbs  The down side is that the only motion sensors to connect with the lights are still batter powered, so you would end up changing batteries.  The up side is that you could tie the bulbs to other events in the house, e.g. turning on the exterior lights whenever you open an exterior door at night.

Put some cameras up on the outside that would deter people from breaking in. Invest in a monitored security system - this will limit the amount of time someone can stay if they do get inside. Burglar will likely flee immediately. Plenty more ideas available on the wiki"

homedefense,39ixwa,old_two_thumbs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:22:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I am less worried about the hardware as I know I can price this off the internet.  No model numbers were on the quote, but they were quoting me additional cameras for $450 each.  Considering similar can be had off Amazon for $150 or below or under $100 off AliExpress, they are jacking up the prices 3-4x on Dahua.  My main concern is finding out the ball park on cabling so I avoid getting ripped off.  I'd really like it to be professionally done as I do not really want to learn to cable on my own house.  If I had a crawl space or attic, this would be easy.  Vendor quote includes no conduit;they said the cable they used was weather resistant.  Conduit does sound good to protect from cable cuts though.  How difficult the cable runs are?  Well, hard for me to judge, I am not a cable guy, but since I do not have a crawl space and an attic that only covers part of the house, they would likely have to run much of the cabling outside until they could get to an attic space.  Once in the attic, I  assume routing the cables to one location for the NVR would be typical. My house is a simple box.  Cameras would be 2 in back, 1 on each side of the house and then 2 in front.  There is attic space in the front, but not in the back due to vaulted ceilings.  $4k to cable up 6 cameras sounds like too much to me, but I don't know what the right ball park should be..."
homedefense,39ixwa,old_two_thumbs,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:10:59 2015 UTC,"4k is way too much for six cameras. If you bought the whole NVR system and cameras it wouldn't cost you more than a thousand. You can get a thousand feet of Cat5 for under 70. If you want to save money you don't really need to use conduit, it just makes it look cleaner, just make sure the Cat5 is rated for outdoor use. Conduit will run you about 5 dollars for 10 feet. Fittings and a conduit bender will cost you about a 100.  All in all if you do everything yourself you're going to pay no more than 1,500 dollars.   If you can't do it yourself, you can always hire a A/V company or electrician to run the cabling and conduit themselves, which would still be less if they don't have CCTV in mind.  I have a 16 camera 700TVL system, and when I ran it myself I paid no more than $700 for cameras, wiring, and everything."

homedefense,395z39,fromkentucky,2,Tue Jun 9 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"This. Is. Incredible.  I didn't even know this type of product exists; and for such a reasonable price!  My only concern is setting it in a way where frequent sidewalk passerby or stray animals don't set it off too often. (The latter is unlikely, but has happened before.)  Maybe I could set the sensor to point at the bike nook so it only sounds if someone messes with the bikes?"
homedefense,395z39,Meziroth,2,Wed Jun 10 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe put it in the nook facing out? People wouldn't be able to tamper with it easily there either. Regardless, good luck and I hope you can keep your next bike from getting pilfered. A wireless camera watching the bike might not be bad either, if you have a power outlet nearby:  http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DCS-930L-mydlink-Enabled-Wireless-N-Network/dp/B00452V66G"
homedefense,395z39,Meziroth,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:05:03 2015 UTC,Power outlet is the tricky part. The only outlet outside in the nook is right near the gate; it could be unplugged from outside without having to even touch the gate.

homedefense,395z39,Industrialscientific,2,Wed Jun 10 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"Is there a thumb-turn/handle on the inside of the dead bolt?  If so, the simplest explanation is that they may have used a small prybar to bend the cover plate back and then wrapped the crooked end around to the thumb-turner and flipped it open. This isn't particularly complicated and could easily be remedied by using a lock that's key-turned on both sides. Also, install some chain anchors or even a second locked gate if you're going to store stuff in that nook."
homedefense,395z39,Industrialscientific,2,Tue Jun 9 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"There is a knob/handle on the inside of the deadbolt, though it's surrounded by a metal cuff (for lack of a better term) intended to make that more difficult. As the pictures show, the whole deadbolt unit is also surrounded by metal grating (intended to make it harder to stick something through the bars to manipulate the deadbolt). I suppose they managed to bypass all of that? Thanks.  Edit: Here is a picture of the cuff I was describing: http://imgur.com/NSRrfIM  I ran the key-on-both-sides idea by the building manager and was informed that such a lock is illegal where we live. For fire safety reasons, you have to be able to exit the apartment without a key. Major disappointment.   The welder estimates that someone with a crowbar could have forced the door open because of a gap between the gate-door and the rest of the gate."
homedefense,395z39,Meziroth,5,Tue Jun 9 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"Ex-locksmith here.  The deadbolt you are using is a bottom-end Kwikset. They are highly susceptible to picking; the collar (""pipe wrench"" attacks) is weak. The bolt isn't terribly long, either, and although they may have changed in recent years, I don't recall Kwikset bolts as having either a roll pin or a hardened insert.  However, in this instance, it doesn't appear to be the deadbolt that failed. A longer bolt may have been more effective, but that's not the problem of the lock itself.  If you wanted to go a step up, look at Schlage. Any of the high security lines- Medeco, Abloy, ASSA, Mul-T-Lock- should offer better locks, and probably a better bolt. Look for a freely-turning collar to resist pipe-wrench attacks. Check for a hardened roll pin on the bolt, and a longer ""throw"" on the bolt itself.  I'm not sure about Schlage Primus; they may have a better deadbolt than most of the hardware-store junk out there these days, but I honestly don't know. Been out of the biz too long. I always liked Abloy, but I have Medeco locks on the house out of convenience."
homedefense,396cta,RunForWord,2,Tue Jun 9 16:02:31 2015 UTC,Missing a switch.  Yes.  Neither the camera nor the NVR would be asleep. Generally you'd set up motion detection in the camera and it would be detecting motion by changes in the video.  You won't. The systems designed to do cloud stuff only do cloud stuff. The solution here is one of the lockbox.

homedefense,396cta,InternetStranger4You,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:04:01 2015 UTC,Do not buy this Ethernet! It's copper clad aluminum (CCA). Aka aluminum cable with a little bit of copper on it. Get some quality Ethernet from someone like monoprice.com. CCA is very brittle and is an electrical fire waiting to happen with POE. Also remember that the max lenth of an Ethernet cable is 100m or about 330ft. Bulk Ethernet is also not terninated and you will need to know how to crimp on the jacks.
homedefense,396cta,theazman,0,Fri Jul 10 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'd get a different set of cat5e. That cable looks pretty bad and has bad reviews. Go to home depot and get a spool of 1000. Keep in mind, if you get PVC it won't be up to code, you'll want Plenum."
homedefense,396cta,thomamelas,2,Tue Jun 9 18:42:21 2015 UTC,Plenum rated cable is only required if the cable is being run through a plenum air space. Plenum airspaces in residential spaces are rare and the code specifically exempts one and two family homes from the plenum requirement.
homedefense,396cta,theazman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it depends on where you are. My understanding is that PVC if caught on fire on one side, the fumes will travel along the cable and get into the other side, but I could be wrong.   Agreed that plenum air spaces are rare in homes."
homedefense,396cta,thomamelas,2,Tue Jun 9 21:07:33 2015 UTC,Both PVC and Plenum cable will burn. Plenum rated cable will burn slower and it burns less toxic. This matters for running them in plenum airspaces because plenum airspaces are used as part of the HVAC system as part of the venting system. The burning cable will feed directly into the air people are breathing. It also matters because plenum airspaces have higher pressure and higher amounts of oxygen. So putting PVC cable in that space causes them to burn faster.   It's possible that some areas have adopted stricter fire codes but it's covered in NEC 800.113 so exceptions will be very rare.

homedefense,393adk,vehstijul,3,Tue Jun 9 00:07:00 2015 UTC,"CCTV professional here. Foscam cameras are neat gadget cameras. They're not real security cameras. Their resolution and optics tend to be sub-par, and they aren't reliable. Also they don't seem to support PoE.  Since we're talking about a decent budget here, I'd suggest looking at Hikvision IP cameras. Great quality at a good price point."

homedefense,393adk,817682,2,Tue Jun 9 00:52:04 2015 UTC,"There are two flavors of wired - IP/Ethernet, and composite/analog video. Often, power is supplied with the same cable - PoE if it's IP, or straight 12v DC for the analog stuff.  Or, there's wireless - usually 802.11g or n.  I am personally not a fan of wireless cameras because of the configuration/bandwidth issues, and because you'll still need to have a power source, so it's not truly wireless, just not network-wired.   The upside of analog cameras is that they're cheaper, there's minimal (or no) configuration allowed or required, and there are virtually no interoperability issue.  My perception is that the main argument in favor of IP cameras instead of analog is video quality and more flexible management/configuration, as most things are done in software over the network/cloud.   If you are trying to keep the budget down, my recommendation would be to have analog cameras connected to a central system - DVR appliance or PC - that then talks to the rest of the world over IP."
homedefense,393adk,notoriousBRK,2,Tue Jun 9 03:23:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. This is helpful information.   Do you have any recommendations for IP or analog cameras? I'm looking for the best video quality at the low to mid-range level.

homedefense,38z5c4,Streetrider399,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:54:49 2015 UTC,Outdoor motions are very (very) prone to false alarms unless you're really limiting the coverage area.  If you're looking for an early-warning system you'll probably turn it off after a month.  But if you want to look down that path the Optex stuff is typically the go-to for outdoor motions.
