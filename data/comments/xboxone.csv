xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,5,Tue Jul 21 00:36:28 2015 UTC,I think The Evil Withins season pass in on sale too.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Maddox888,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:18 2015 UTC,"added, thanks!"
xboxone,3e0gwi,B_Nasty21,5,Tue Jul 21 00:38:49 2015 UTC,ESO hm? I see you. I just can't download you cuz you're 70 GB.
xboxone,3e0gwi,throwawayinthefire,8,Tue Jul 21 00:59:05 2015 UTC,Ughh i want horizon 2 so badly but I dont want forza 5 THAT badly.  I should've bought it when they made it $30 a few weeks back  So... How is forza 5?
xboxone,3e0gwi,TheCactus27,7,Tue Jul 21 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"I personally have the unpopular opinion of preferring Forza 5 to Horizon.  I don't really have a reason for liking 5 more, I just always have. Anyways, I don't think the Forza bundle is very smart, simply because Forza 6 is coming out pretty soon. But you should definitely pick up Horizon 2 whenever it's on sale standalone, it's a great game!"
xboxone,3e0gwi,throwawayinthefire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"I liked forza 4 a lot until I accidentally deleted all my progress and stopped playing haha. I like the Motorsport games but I guess it is since motorsport 6 is coming out that I don't care for 5 that much  I should look it up myself, but have they announced anything cool for forza 6? Besides new cars and such?"
xboxone,3e0gwi,thaWafflebot,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:49 2015 UTC,Dynamic weather is cool
xboxone,3e0gwi,theSeanO,4,Tue Jul 21 01:45:08 2015 UTC,"Forza 5 and Horizon 2 are really different animals. They share driving mechanics and physics, but 5 is restrictive in that you can only drive on specific tracks in specific configurations during specific championship series. Horizon has set tracks and championships, but in between it's a lot more open. I like both just because I find them different enough not to compare them to each other."
xboxone,3e0gwi,SupDenBoi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:58 2015 UTC,is infinity runner any good? $3 bucks for a game is always nice
xboxone,3e0gwi,liquidblue4,4,Tue Jul 21 00:52:52 2015 UTC,If you like runners then it's pretty decent. Worth $3 for sure.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Broken_Pikachu,3,Tue Jul 21 02:07:59 2015 UTC,I have been waiting for Dark Souls 2 to drop in price for a while now. Will definitely be picking it up this week.
xboxone,3e0gwi,ReactiveLeek44,3,Tue Jul 21 01:02:58 2015 UTC,I just bought ESO from Amazon for $35 ($38 with tax) on Prime Day.  I'm tempted to return it and get the digital version.

xboxone,3e0gwi,EvaBongoria,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:32 2015 UTC,"Damn.. got dark souls 2 for 39.99 at eb games on Sunday,  prob be same in canada."
xboxone,3e0gwi,obtusegiraffe,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:51 2015 UTC,"it's easier to accept that not every purchase you make will be optional, take it from me"
xboxone,3e0gwi,tstorm004,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"Old Blood is the sequel right? If I haven't played the first One game, will I be confused. I keep hearing good things about these new Wolfenstiens.. But missed the bundle sale from the last few weeks while waiting on a paycheck..."
xboxone,3e0gwi,unscleric,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Prequel, and it fits in perfectly with The New Order.  You can play the prequel first with no issues at all.  It actually would be better to do so."
xboxone,3e0gwi,tstorm004,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:39 2015 UTC,Ok cool thanks! Is the prequel shorter? Or is it a full size game like the original?
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"Only 8 chapters , the new order has 16 but its pretty long so far i played 7 hours and i just started chapter 4"
xboxone,3e0gwi,unscleric,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:41 2015 UTC,It's shorter.  Six hours compared to twelve.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Marcoangelo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:49 2015 UTC,its a prequel so you should be fine and the Wolfenstein bundle is still on sale
xboxone,3e0gwi,tstorm004,0,Tue Jul 21 01:19:48 2015 UTC,Oh perfect thanks! Didn't know it was still on sale!
xboxone,3e0gwi,dennisb407,3,Tue Jul 21 01:52:00 2015 UTC,"It's released on disc tomorrow, if you like physical copies"
xboxone,3e0gwi,Yung2112,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:04 2015 UTC,Bundle on sale too https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Bundle/Wolfenstein-Bundle/162fe802-efa5-43b7-a9fe-d20121b7d54c
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,3,Tue Jul 21 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"Old blood isnt a sequel it takes place before the new order , by far the best FPS on xbox one i loved both of them"
xboxone,3e0gwi,mando44646,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"Not a bad price for ESO, though I just got it for $30 at best buy last week.  Infinity runner any good? The screenshots look kinda cool"
xboxone,3e0gwi,atwistedsmile,0,Tue Jul 21 01:27:26 2015 UTC,"What does the car pass for Forza 5 actually contain?  Is there a list of the cars anywhere? The description on Smartglass just says ""80 cars"" and only mentions what one of them actually is.   Is it worth the money?"
xboxone,3e0gwi,Kelky111,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:39 2015 UTC,"I've found a list of the car packs included in the Car Pass, here's a link to check them out in more detail Link  LaFerrari Car Pack  IGN Car Pack  The Smoking Tire Car Pack  Alpinestars Car Pack  Top Gear Car Pack  Meguiar's Car Pack  Bondurant Car Pack  Hot Wheels Car Pack  Road America Booster Pack  Long Beach Booster Pack  Nürburgring Booster Pack"
xboxone,3e0gwi,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"How's Wolfenstein? I've always thought about getting the New Order, but I've never heard about the Old Blood. Is it pretty much the same game?"
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:03 2015 UTC,Old blood takes place before the new order and to answer you question is by far the best FPS on xbox one i loved both of them
xboxone,3e0gwi,Iknowwhereyoualllive,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"So it's essentially the same game, but with a different storyline? I'll probably pick it up, New Order looked really good."
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,3,Tue Jul 21 01:27:56 2015 UTC,Correct same game engine different story line
xboxone,3e0gwi,Iknowwhereyoualllive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:08 2015 UTC,Sweet. For $15 I'll definitely pick it up sometime this week.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Tyruz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:28 2015 UTC,Ive been wanting Dark souls...i watch it a lot on twitch. Im really scared to pull the trigger tho.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Hughowl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:41 2015 UTC,Just do it.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Tyruz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:10 2015 UTC,Yep. I pulled the trigger. Lol.
xboxone,3e0gwi,Skynetz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:10 2015 UTC,I just rented ESO from Gamefly a few days ago. Guess there's nothing for me here.
xboxone,3e0gwi,carloselcoco,0,Tue Jul 21 01:42:13 2015 UTC,Tembo the Badass Elephant is not part of this sale. That is a different sale.
xboxone,3e0gwi,QuesadillaAnywayican,5,Tue Jul 21 01:55:03 2015 UTC,I love to play F5 should I get the car pass?
xboxone,3e0gwi,jack_fry,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:24 2015 UTC,Anyone know if the evil within season pass content is any good?
xboxone,3e0gwi,Moraduke,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:00 2015 UTC,Wondering this too. Was thinking about grabbing it since it might not be any cheaper than $13.
xboxone,3e0gwi,BionicSammich,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:42 2015 UTC,I need to grab me some of that Wolfenstein.
xboxone,3e0gwi,UnsolvedParadox,0,Tue Jul 21 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"Sweet, time to pick up The Old Blood!"
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ozymayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"I bought the base version of ESO during the Ultimate Game Sale for full price since only the premium edition was on sale and now this happens... lol.  Oh well, should be worth it considering it's an MMO."
xboxone,3e0gwi,Ricanlegend,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"Am surprise the elder scrolls online its already on sale , is the game that bad ?"
xboxone,3e0gwi,YourMotherLovedMe,0,Tue Jul 21 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"its actually pretty awesome imo. games have been dropping fast lately. makes me hesitant to buy games day one anymore unless i can milk my GCU at best buy of course.   actually caved and bought my first digital game last week (TR: DE)... ugh... still downloading it, been 2 days. my xbox cant seem to get above 1mbps."
xboxone,3e0gwi,weejohnathon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:39 2015 UTC,Its most likely due to the 1st paid dlc being announced and I'm pretty sure MS pay developers an ammount of $ to get the deals with gold. Remember ESO was on PC a year before consoles its not as new as people think.
xboxone,3e0gwi,tyzenberg,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:24 2015 UTC,Stolen from /u/jrmwvu04   My guess is that they are planning to sell the title cheap and make it up with crown store stuff. Freemium style.
xboxone,3e0gwi,ALECop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:44 2015 UTC,Its actually a very good MMO with a shit ton to do and surprisingly fun pvp.
xboxone,3e0gwi,2222lil,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:34 2015 UTC,Yes
