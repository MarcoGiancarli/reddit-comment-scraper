With the beer can, the Yager machine, the laser lights, the boombox/speakers, the road case, the bar stools, and overall bar-like setup I'd say it's party shack for some kids. Surprisingly well built though.  The owner of the land should do something about it though. Depending on your laws it's possible he could be liable if someone gets injured while on his land.

In one or two states he wouldn't be liable as a matter of law if they contributed to the injury by their own negligence, even 1%.

Assuming 5 seconds for each combo try (which is a little liberal), is 7 hours worth of work at the most (2-3 if you're even faster!). This kid has got some patience..."
WhatsInThisThing,3dsbm7,Fogest,19,Sun Jul 19 02:38:46 2015 UTC,If you start at 1950 and move upwards to 2000 you have 50 combinations not 5000. 50 x 5 secs = 250 secs or 4 min 10 sec. Less than 5 minutes by your math to check all the most likely birth years as the combo

We took a flashlight this time and looked over the top of the door and saw the miscellaneous bottles and cans of beer. I thought they'll probably keep it simple if they're leaving the shack drunk and need to lock up, so we tried 0000, 1111-9999, 1234, and then descending date of birth from 2001"

You can use one of those special holder or you can wrap the blade up in some tape.   The hinges is only a piece of 10mm unhardened mild steel round bar. Once both hinges are cut you can remove the door.

WhatsInThisThing,3codhb,CartoonJustice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well, depending on the size of safe and the type of explosive... That seal might not matter.  The pressure cookers worked as a fuse for the bomb, allowing them to set it and get away. For a safe-bomb, they'd use a timer."

Make sure you have the key inserted correctly and fully....you can GENTLY tap it in to be sure it is fully seated in the lock. If if begins to turn, even just a bit, don't force it, give it a gentle amount of turning pressure. If it still won't budge, spray more oil in and reinsert the key. Rock the key back and fourth to try and loosen whatever has become stuck. This type of keylock will allow the key to turn about 70 degrees, even if it is the wrong key.

Switch-hook dialing of article  Pulse dialing:       As pulse dialing is achieved by interruption of the local loop, it was in principle possible to dial a telephone number by rapidly tapping, i.e. depressing, the switch hook the corresponding number of times for each digit at approximately ten taps per second. However, many telephone makers implemented a slow switch hook release to prevent rapid switching. [citation needed]  In the United Kingdom, it used to be possible to make calls from coin-box phones (payphones) by tapping the switch hook without depositing coins. A person caught tapping could be charged with 'abstracting electricity' from the General Post Office and several cases were prosecuted under this offense. [citation needed]  In popular culture, tapping was used in the film Red Dragon as a way for prisoner Hannibal Lecter to dial out on a phone with no dialing mechanism. This method was also used by the character 'Phantom Phreak' to call 'Acid Burn' when taken to prison in the film Hackers.

It was also a term for basic accommodation, usually for gardeners or other workers on an estate. Bothies are to be found in remote, mountainous areas of Scotland, northern England, Ireland, and Wales. They are particularly common in the Scottish Highlands but related buildings can be found around the world (e.g., in the Nordic countries, there are wilderness huts). A bothy was also a semi-legal drinking den in the Isle of Lewis. These, such as Bothan Eòrapaidh, were used until recent years as gathering points for local men, and were often situated in an old hut or caravan.

WhatsInThisThing,39ut8z,unsanitary_napkin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:05:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I just googled bounce attack.. I'll read into it more, thanks.  So it looks like the bounce attack works on certain lower end safes, I think this safe is higher quality.  Sentinel Owner’s Manual   2.5 Locking system The Sentinel safe has a locking system specially designed to resist forcible  entry. Instead of conventional lockin g bolts, a high-grade steel locking  latch is used. This locking latch will engage and hook the door to the frame  if a tool is forced in between them. It is virtually impossible to force the  door open once the latch has engaged.   2.6 Anti-tamper Slots  One of the attack points on a safe is the holes in the door. Smart thieves  attempt to manipulate the electronics and locking mechanism through  these holes.  The Sentinel safe has only one small slot hidden behind the keyboard- compartment. In addition, an anti-tamper shield makes it virtually  impossible to reach essential elec tronics and the locking mechanism from  the outside.   2.7    The Automatic Relock function  The Sentinel safe is equipped with a function called  Automatic Relock . If someone tries to manually move the  locking latch from the locked position, the safe will resi st and move the latch back in to locked position. This  feature is designed for two purposes:  1.   To improve the safe's break-in resistance.  2.   To prevent the latch from being manually forced ba ck to the open position when the safe is inadvertently  locked with the door open. Forcing the latch open ca n cause the safe's electronics to malfunction and  may require an emergency override or service call  to correct the malfunction. The Automatic Relock  function prevents this from happening, and forces t he user to ""open"" the safe with their open code  instead."

WhatsInThisThing,39ut8z,Aaronmcom,3,Mon Jun 15 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I currently have it right next to my computer chair, every once in a while I just put in random combinations. I've tried this for a week or so now. I think I'm going to have to be more methodical, I have a feeling I've repeated the same code several times."
WhatsInThisThing,39ut8z,Aaronmcom,10,Mon Jun 15 03:25:04 2015 UTC,Just print out all the number combinations and keep that list near your safe. Cross off the ones you've tried as you try them.
WhatsInThisThing,39vkc6,piratt227,3,Mon Jun 15 03:50:26 2015 UTC,That safe looks much older than 1988
WhatsInThisThing,39vkc6,xDirty,3,Mon Jun 15 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"The safe shown is from around the 1930- 1940`s. It was most likely made by the Victor safe company. They literally made thousands of this model, in several sizes. If the dial still turns freely, it can be opened by feel, or by shear luck. It has three numbers, and a stop point. The last turn to the right withdraws the locking bolts.  The wheels have a gap of several numbers wide, so trying all possible combinations is quite easy on this one. You can space them out every thred numbers and still get it to open. The dialing sequence is : Left four times to the first number Right three times three times to the second number Left two times to the third number Right until the dial comes to a stop. PULL THE DOOR OPEN"

WhatsInThisThing,39vkc6,Iamabassi,2,Mon Jun 15 18:43:39 2015 UTC,Oh please don't cut the hinges off...that NEVER opens a safe. They ALL have bolts on the hinge side to prevent this from happening.

Navy seals will routinely carry snickers bars instead of other items as they have more calories, carbs and protein than like sized items.   A phone book wouldn't be a bad idea, especially back then.

WhatsInThisThing,39cieo,Sporkeldee,3,Thu Jun 11 02:04:11 2015 UTC,Wow! You are more ready than I am. Your ideas sound good. Do you have family and kids that you would need to consider also?
WhatsInThisThing,39cieo,mamawantsallama,2,Thu Jun 11 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't. Depending on your family, wether you have small children or elderly, you'll have to re evaluate your situation and maybe have to stay in place.   In that case I would look at a place above sea level to prevent fallout from settling, with a groundwater source, like well, or similar.   Water purification should be your #1 priority. Have a clean water source, and then construct a shelter if you're not using a bunker.   Then have a source for fire, fire starters are great, but don't forget a bic lighter Sometimes you need fire now. Carry Fritos and Doritos, these are highly flammable. And are able to be crushed into powder to conserve space.   Then find food. As long as the integrity of a metal can is instant, the food inside is edible. The downside is their weight. Light weight foods should be high energy, full of carbs and sugars and protein. Keep foods suspended and clear of campsites to keep animals away.   Lastly, have scavenging tools. Crowbars and sledgehammers will be your best friends. Or even better head to a fire station and get a Halligan tool. In order to survive, you'll need to put any qualms aside about breaking into places and taking what you need.   You'll also need to take into consideration that others are doing the same thing you are and you'll have to defend yourself"

I'd strongly behoove you to get training in first aid, so you can treat yourself and others.

I don't see how an improvised shelter could protect you from radiation. Wouldn't the whole thing need to be completely sealed, along with its own ventilation system? Personally, I'd research the shit out of the subject before starting a project like that (back in those days it would have meant a lot of time in the library)."
WhatsInThisThing,39cieo,Wilson2424,2,Thu Jun 11 15:12:50 2015 UTC,They also taught school children to get under their desks in case of a nuclear attack. Not always a lot of good info back then. A buried shelter was believed to be better than nothing. Probably might not have done much good.

Pull down on thumb latch. Very carefully wiggle each key pin. The ones with most resistance are the keyed in numbers. It takes a sensitive touch.  Option b) try all four digit combos. Keeping in mind that 1234 works for 1324...etc... Option c) hammer time. Happy whacking!

Some antique lures and reels can be worth a lot of money, especially in good condition and with the box.

With that much damage, it is very unlikely to salvage any part of the safe. The door is held in place by three bolts, evenly spaced around the edge.  Recommend opening: Slip a very thin piece of plastic into the crack between the door and safe body. Slide it around until you have located the three bolts. Mark them on the door with a sharpe. Get yourself a good hand drill and several 1/2"" bits (high speed steel will be fine).  Drill at the edge of the door on the center of each bolt. Keep the hole completely on the door, not touching the edge, bur really close. Angle slightly towards the safe body, the door is approximately 1"" thick before you strike the locking bolt. Continue drilling to completely cut each bolt in half. Don't fool yourself, this will take some time to complete. Be sure to use proper safety glasses and gloves as you will break a drill bit or two durring this attack.  option two. If the safe can be accessed from below (like from a basement) cut a hole in the bottom  (it's only 1/4"" thick) and inspect for contents.

The first hat also has this eagle pin on it.   Now as for the tunic insignia... He's got some officer collar tabs. Royal blue means Transport, Administrative Service (TSD), which is also evident from the fancy officer shoulder boards (which are also royal blue) and rank pips (2 means Captain). The cypher on the shoulder board indicates Special Service Officer. According to this thread, ""These are for the Truppensonderdienst Offizier des Verwaltungsdienst (Special Service Officer, Administrative Branch)""  Now from the ID disk... I'll be honest, I have no clue what H.St.V. stands for. This abbreviation guide on page 86 says ""Regulations for the execution of sentences in the army"" but that doesn't sound right in this context. Maybe someone else will know?  So what this tells me the owner of that stuff was a member of the Wehrmacht Heer, which was the general army (no Nazi party affiliation). So he may not have been an actual Nazi party member. The SS was the only branch of the military where Nazi party membership was required (and they're also the most infamous). This stuff also tells me he was, well, an administrative officer. Specifically, Oberzahlmeister is Paymaster. He wouldn't have even been a trained soldier, such an intimidating uniform for such a non-threatening role!  If you want more information, http://www.wehrmacht-awards.com/forums/ can probably answer all your questions and more.

I think this comment provides some good insight on why it may have been buried (especially with those cigars and rum!):    if he had been captured by the soviets, all of these things would have been taken away from him. that is easy enough to understand. he most probably put his valuables in the box with the intent to return and retreive them one day. these are reasons enough to believe this box has some legitimate motive."

This usage is erroneous, popularised largely as a result of the adoption of the caduceus as its insignia by the U.S. Army Medical Corps in 1902 at the insistence of a single officer (though there are conflicting claims as to whether this was Capt.

Der Zahlmeister im Dienstgrad eines >Leutnants trug auf seinen Offiziers-Schulterstücken kunstvoll gestaltete und miteinander verbundene Großbuchstaben: ein „H“ und ein „V“ als Abkürzung für Heeresverwaltung. Das gleiche Schulterstück wie der Zahlmeister, jedoch zusätzlich je ein Stern zierte die Schulterstücke der Oberzahlmeister. Stabszahlmeister trugen zwei Sterne. Oberstabszahlmeister hatten nur die verbunden Großbuchstaben „HV“ auf ihrem – mit Schlaufen versehenen – Schulterstückpaar. Bei Oberfeldzahlmeister kam ein Stern dazu.   It pretty much says that the Zahlmeister was an officer in the German Wehrmacht who communicates between the Heeresverwaltung and the lower strands of the Wehnmacht.  The rank Zahlmeister is the lowest rank of Zahlmeisters, the Oberzahlmeister, as seen in the pics, is responsible for the Pioneers, the Information, and the driving departements.  Quite an interesting find, but he is not a postman, rather a mediator."

WhatsInThisThing,38m1pr,BurrrY,2,Fri Jun 5 12:54:22 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's a super common misconception. The symbol actually means commerce (both in historical context, as well as in the Wehrmacht's uniform guidelines--only commercial medical centers in the US, and the US Army use the commerce symbol, because of a mixup in the early 1900's).  Here's a good article about the misconception and how it came about: http://www.drblayney.com/Asclepius.html    A major reason for the current popularity of the caduceus as a medical symbol was its illinformed [03] official adoption as the insignia for the Medical Department of the United States Army in 1902.   The actual international symbol for doctors/healing is a snake on a stick, called the Staff of Asclepius  Here's what the Wehrmacht veterinary symbol looked like: http://www.usmbooks.com/images/NVU/NaziVeterinarian8.jpg  And the doctor symbol: http://www.germanmilitaria.com/Heer/photos/H036360full.jpg"

WhatsInThisThing,36kqr9,Bdtry,14,Wed May 27 00:55:27 2015 UTC,Not sure on the brand but the lock is most likely a Sargent Greenleaf 6730 group 2 safe lock. It can be manipulated open. Smashing the dial out will not work. A grinder/crowbar would be the easiest way to go unless you want to pay for a locksmith to open it.  Use a drill to drill a hole AWAY from the lock and handle. There will be the door itself and then a thin panel on the back of the door you will have to go through. Then use a flashlight to look inside to see if there are any contents. You want to do this before grinding it open in case there are flammables in there.  If you see obvious drugs just call the cops and have them open it.

WhatsInThisThing,367zrp,shankkilla420,1 point,Sun May 17 15:52:41 2015 UTC,No way to determine age since a lot of people buy the ammo cans and fill them up. The ammo is most likely fine but you would want to check each one over before loading it into your gun. Personally I wouldn't shoot it.
WhatsInThisThing,367zrp,Triks1,4,Sun May 17 16:37:17 2015 UTC,Why not? As long as there isn't any suface rust or corrosion it should be safe to fire.

Pull on both ends hard and start turning the first ring until you feel a click. Keep doing this until you get a click on each one and it should open.

You could put some sort of threaded spreader (maybe a cheap vehicle spring compressor used backwards?) in pairs to unload all the pressure on them, then once a few boards have been removed you can slide them all out of this new slot.  you should try to make a long ""L"" shaped  tool or find a large 90 degree drafting ruler you could use to insert and rotate to push the signs by their edges.   using this method you should be able to spread the sections like a stack of paper and slide your prizes out. :-D"

WhatsInThisThing,33a0ll,Narissis,4,Tue Apr 21 03:00:54 2015 UTC,That laminate flooring goes together just like Lego's (and comes apart). You can pull off the baseboard on one end of a bedroom and pull up enough laminate to get one of the signs out and see if it is worth anything. Just keep track of the order in which you pulled them off. Then put the lumber back and the laminate should click right back together.

EDIT: Consider drilling a hole large enough to get an LED borescope inside. That way you can look around to see if there's anything delicate or possibly explosive. Showering a box of ammo with slag is a VERY BAD IDEA.

WhatsInThisThing,32xue4,GutterClown,3,Sat Apr 18 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"So you've got a Yale 'Value' series Office safe with the override key cap removed.  I've worked with their Certified and Fire series, but this is probably from a different manufacturer so I can't say for certain what the default code is. Most times the Yales come without a factory code entered; you use the keys to open it, insert batteries and set a code as needed.  Swing in to your local Locksmith and ask them to pick the tubular lock.  Shouldn't take ten minutes, you'll have a working container (assuming the battery pack hasn't corroded too much).  Worst case scenario, it's an £85 safe so not worth repairing."

WhatsInThisThing,32ewao,throwaway92715,35,Mon Apr 13 06:00:27 2015 UTC,"To clarify a few questions:    I didn't keep any, get anything as a reward, or even consider stealing them. Even in hindsight, that would have been at least a job-ender, if not a freedom-ender. I would have most certainly been caught. The owner was once on the board of the bank in question and these may well have belonged to the bank itself, or his family, or his business. Board members were given the use of safe deposit boxes without a rental fee. Perhaps this is why they have no record. I put on a new lock and turned over the keys immediately. The owner and his family were notified. The bank had 50 unrented (as far as they could tell) safe deposit boxes, but the keys were nowhere to be found. After I found the coins, an employee was sent to witness the opening of the remaining 48.   *Other things I have found in sdbs, 20 pounds of Morgan Silver Dollars, handwritten song lyrics by some unknown artist that he mailed to himself in order to establish copyright, macaroni sculptures (like kids glue up in preschool), a 1971 copy of Easy Rider, lots of coin collections, 130k in hundreds, and one box that was full of opiate-based drug samples. Only about %25 of the time is there any content whatsoever, and when there is something, it's usually just deeds, titles, wills, insurance papers, etc."

WhatsInThisThing,32ewao,Slabbo,10,Mon Apr 13 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"When a bank needs a lock drilled/pulled for non-payment, we have to be there with a third party notary public to witness the opening. The bank then inventories all the contents and puts it in storage so they can return the box to the rental pool. After a period of time (I'm not sure how long) the bank sends the items to the State Treasurer who holds them an additional 12 years and then they auction them off.   If it's illegal, the bank calls the police and the State Treasurer's office. I've never found anything illegal other than the drug samples, but I'm sure they would call the police."

WhatsInThisThing,31nhqb,v8jet,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:09:53 2015 UTC,Its has some minor surface rust but the dial doesn't seem to grind when turned. Thank you for giving me something to Google. This is the first good how-to I found but it may not be exactly how mine works. http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/security/safecracking3.htm
WhatsInThisThing,31nhqb,v8jet,2,Thu Apr 9 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"It's designed to be surrounded by concrete, usually in the floor.  The lock dials as standard 4-3-2-1 LRLR.  Example turn left to the forth instance of 85, right to the third instance of 75, left to the second instance of 65, then right til stop at unlocked.  That link provides a basic theory and does apply to your safe. It's not 100% right.  For more in depth theory, look up Safecracking for the Computer Scientist.  It's free.  It provides good theory but uses the slower method for testing.  One good test of the wheel is the turn the dial one direction at least four times around and stop at 50.  Reverse direction and slowly turn the dial paying attention to the area at 50.  You should be able to feel/hear the wheel pick up.  You should get that indication for three consecutive turns and ideally at the same point.  Usually the dial gets a little heavier each time.  If your wheels pass this test they are probably OK.  Your contact points are closer to 0.  Park all wheels one direction like you did before, then turn back toward zero and slowly oscillate the dial.  You'll feel the cam picking up the nose at two points.  Edit: messed up my dial example lol"
WhatsInThisThing,31nhqb,aplussafeandlock,2,Fri Apr 10 01:13:40 2015 UTC,Grabbed this just before the local scrapper drove by. Its heavy as fuck and doesn't show any signs of somebody trying to open it by force. It also doesn't sound like there is anything inside since nothing is bouncing around when I tip it. I'd still like to open it nondestructively just for the geek cred.  I've visited the Gardall website and they will sell the combo through a locksmith but that doesn't sound like any fun. Besides the price for said combo is probably more than the safe's value.

WhatsInThisThing,30qmua,AngryCod,3,Mon Mar 30 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"these are very very easy to bypass the pin code pad if you have the key.   Firstly, i take no responsibility for any damages or injury. or if a bunch of wild stray cats suddenly appear and eat your flesh.  this method worked for me when i accidentally locked my safe pin code in my safe after it was given to me and i also only had the key. i actually had found this information somewhere here on reddit at the time and it worked for my sentry fire safe which looks nearly identical. first find 2 short wires or 2 paper clips. 1. unlock key cylinder lock (should pop outwards) 2. remove battery pack 3. carefully stick a small knife below 0 key on pin pad black plastic (not too deep, just enough to pry) and pry outward enough to grab with your fingernail and pull it off. 4. remove the white pin pad (if it hasnt dropped off the circuit board already) it just sits in place. 5. carefully lift up circuit board and inspect for 4 wires soldered to the board. should be from top to bottom black, red, black, white (at least mine are, the 2 bottom wire colors may be different but they supply power to the solenoid). note - the two at the top are the power feeds to the board from the battery pack connection the two on the bottom are the supply's for the electronic solenoid which if you were to type in the correct code the power would flow from the battery pack to the solenoid momentarily unlock the door pins internally.  6. now take the battery pack and the wires and stick, wrap or tape the 2 separate wire ends to the positive and negative terminals on the pack. now take the other ends of the wires and contact them to the 2 lower soldered connections to the front of the circuit board (the side the pin pad was on) that supply power to the solenoid. only touch the soldered spots, nothing else. at this point if you did it correctly, you will instantly audibly hear the solenoid move/fire and while still holding the wires in place turn the handle and viola the safe if open. DO NOT HOLD THE WIRES IN PLACE TOO LONG OR YOU WILL BURN UP THE ELECTRONIC SOLENOID. just long enough to grab and turn the handle."
WhatsInThisThing,30qmua,keenansmith61,2,Mon Mar 30 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, mine are wire clips though. http://imgur.com/a/Ztx5r  Can I just more the power clip to the slot for the solenoid? The rest of the board wouldn't receive power though."
WhatsInThisThing,30qmua,Slave_to_Logic,2,Mon Mar 30 22:51:31 2015 UTC,"unplug the white and black plug from your board and use the battery pack to power the solenoid there... stick the ends of the wires you attached to the battery pack into the white plug end (the part that was originally plugged into the board) the board doesnt need power with this process.. your bypassing a electronic switch controlled by a pin pad and manually firing the solenoid.  yours is different from mine but the board only really serves 1 function, grant the pin code and allow the solenoid to open."

WhatsInThisThing,2zemfk,Shakejunt727,9,Tue Mar 17 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I've done this before; the combo locks on these Sentry containers are toys, they're not intended to be theft-resistant. Pick them off using the handle indicator in that thread."
WhatsInThisThing,2zemfk,Titular_Character,4,Wed Mar 18 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is so far over my head that I have no clue what I'm reading =S"
WhatsInThisThing,2zemfk,Titular_Character,5,Wed Mar 18 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"OK.  In your ""typical"" safe wheel pack, you have three wheels (rarely four) which hold the combination. The one in the back (closest to the camera in that image) is the drive cam; see this image for a side view. You do the left-right-left thing, and in turn each wheel in the wheel pack gets ""stranded"" at a position. If you dial in the right combo, the gates on all three wheels are lined up, and then on the final turn the nose drops in to that gap on the drive cam, allowing the bolt to be retracted.  That's what goes on in a ""real"" safe, anyway. Now, your Sentry is meant to be a fire safe container; it's rated against structure fires, which is actually a pretty rigorous standard that includes resistance to failure from collapse, dropping through the floor (while hot), and blah blah blah. Not too bad for that technology to come down to consumer price levels where you can pick one up at the hardware store and figure, ""Oooh, here's where I can store my Beanie Babies!"" for your retirement fund.  Problem is, the wheel pack on these containers is a piece of shit. With the container described above, you cannot ""test"" to find out if the fence will drop into the gates (well, kinda, you can- I won't go into manipulation of those locks). On a cheap-ass toy safe, you can.  What the author has done in that first web page I reference is used an extension (the coathanger wire) to amplify the deflection of the handle. By playing around with the combination a bit, he is able to differentiate between ""false"" gates (notches in the wheels that are too shallow for the fence to drop in), and the real ones. But even if he couldn't, you're taking the number of combinations down from (about) 40 x 40 x 40 (because the gate is about 2-1/2 digits wide, there are 40 combos per wheel, not 100) to maybe 8-10 per wheel. And if you can find one of those numbers is particularly deep, you could narrow it down to, say, 8 x 1 x 8, or 64 combinations.  These are not particularly tricky containers to open, and with some duct tape (instead of rubber bands), a rigid wire, and a sheet of paper, you can make an indicator that shows how far the handle turns with each combination. Just remember there are three wheel packs in there, and you're only picking the digits off of one at a time. So you will need to play around, find the gate openings, and so forth.  Study how a wheel pack works (I'm sure there are YouTube videos) to understand how the back one moves the middle one moves the front one, and you'll have a better idea of which wheel you are manipulating at a time.  Or just cut it open and buy a new one."
WhatsInThisThing,2zemfk,nuxxor,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe you can tell me if this makes any sense. I (think) I found my contact area, via this sight. I then proceeded to ""graph"" my results via starting at 0 and finding the first click, then clearing the lock and starting -3 so on until full circle.  I didn't see the point in the numbers just like that, so I decided to take the first stop, and go one more turn and see where that landed (what I assume to be the contact area). Exampl:   start - 0 rotate counter clockwise and it clicks at 97 rotate once more counter clockwise and it clicked at 93   I noticed a pattern, 97-93=4  I kept doing this for all the numbers in intervals of 3. Three numbers had a difference of 6 and one had a difference of 7:   -24 -> 73-67=6  -48 -> 50-44=6  -63 -> 35-28=7   So I assumed my password was one of 6 variations of 73-48-35. But this was wrong. What are all these numbers I came up with, I don't have the stuff to set up a way to graph them, but I was assuming that the differences would correlate to the deviation on a graph.   Edit: passwords I tried   35-50-73, 35-73-50, 50-35-73, 50-73-35, 73-35-50 and 73-50-35"

About 10 years ago I was working in a mall when an Indian family on holidays paid for their merchandise in cash, and some of the bills were dated to the 70's. They were so surprised when I didn't recognize the currency, lol, apparently they got it from an uncle who once visited Canada in '76 and had saved it all these years. I was too much of a teenager to give a shit if it was counterfeit, so I accepted it. That $10 bill looks exactly like what they gave me. I just loved their blank innocence about it when I questioned them on the bill, the style was so old-school monarchist through and through, just a totally different era than mine. Dormant all these years cause some tourist in the 70's didn't know what the hell to do with all his trip money. Like my dad and his cuban money that's currently crumpled in the cabinet."

I was on a 6-month Med Cruise in the Navy and we stopped in Dubrovnik for a couple days.   At each stop on the cruise I'd usually trade in $75 or $100 for local currency and in most places I'd spend it before we left. Except for Yugoslavia. The exchange rate was 5500 dinar to the dollar and everything was exceptionally cheap. We were in local bars buying rounds for everyone over and over and we were barely making a dent in our money.  To top it off, we were the first ship to visit in 25 years or so because we were NATO and they were a Warsaw Pact-aligned country. Because of this, we had to go out in uniform and the people there loved us and wanted to buys stuff for us all night.  It was honestly my favorite stop on the cruise."

The exchange rate was definitely 5500 dinar to the dollar though. That I remember specifically. Later on, as Yugoslavia's economy collapsed prior to the civil war, the exchange rate was 10x worse.  I can't find a historical exchange rate for 1989 but Wiki does say their inflation rate accelerated around then and the currency was revalued in 1990 at 10,000-1."

Your Lunenburg Nova Scotia Trade Tokens are also worth in the area of $2 apiece.  As for silver coins Canada and the U.S. share a magic year: 1964.  Most anything minted after that will be clad (non silver) with a few exceptions.  The .03 Canadian coins with the rabbits are worth about .50 apiece.  In the photo which shows the large number of coins on the floor I see some U.S. Kennedy half dollars.  1964 will be 90% silver.  1965-1970 will be 40% silver.  I also think I see a Franklin Half dollar there as well that is 90% silver, but could be worth more than melt based on collector value depending on year and condition.   Just based on what I see in these photos, as a collector I'd give you about $50-75 U.S. for the lot.

WhatsInThisThing,2yp6cg,boinger,6,Wed Mar 11 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Basically ""pretend"" to pick the lock with two paperclips and you'll likely do it within a minute or two.

WhatsInThisThing,2y3fte,cybergibbons,3,Fri Mar 6 16:23:27 2015 UTC,Both safes have locks where you can change the combination. It's unlikely they have been left at default.
WhatsInThisThing,2y3fte,falconae,3,Fri Mar 6 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"According to the website, a combination change has to be done by a locksmith and voids the warranty. Or am I interpreting it incorrectly?"

Their site is unreadable on mobile, so not sure which bit you are referring to."

You would feel the resistance no matter which direction you turned if you turned each way enough to pick up all the wheels. Sounds like you know how to dial so maybe I am not understanding. I believe these use a plastic driver and maybe even nylon or plastic wheels. There are a limited number of possible combinations due to how these are made. I am very conflicted because I could share the combos but that info could be dangerous in the wrong hands. I have never worked on one of these but I do have a pretty good idea of how they work from training and pics I have seen. If you can give me a more complete combo I will fill in the blanks if you are close. I'll go ahead and say the reason you feel a release around 30 is because the last number in the combo is 32. To clarify operation: 3 turns left, 2 right, left to last number for drop in"

No one thought of it we figured it was emptied. Well construction had started on the building and we had to get rid of everything in that area including the safe. The store manager said throw it in the dumpster and I said F that I'm taking it upstairs were nobody will bother me as I try and open this thing. Started out trying to pry the door open but no success. Then realized it was just sheet metal with cement filling. Used a power drill and shears and before no time I made the hole big enough I could fit my hand in and pull what was in it out. I ended up finding 20-30 broken gold necklace chains, 40-60 broken silver necklace chains and 20 or more broken watches. I ended up taking the two watches in the photos because they were the least broken and everything else I gave to my supervisor and asked if I could get the money for the silver and gold that was sent off and they said they would look into it...

WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,smersk,21,Sun Feb 15 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"Your safe has a direct drive combination lock, with three wheels and a drive wheel.  The gates need to be lined up at the 9 o`clock position for the tail piece to enter the wheel pack and open. Your key lock is acting like a handle moving the boltwork. With some practice you can open this safe by feel, not easy but possible.  If you want to drill it open it's  very simple, put a 1/8"" hole just along side the dial ring at the 9 O'clock position, slightly angling in toward the dial. The door is approximately 1"" thick-super easy drilling. Insert a ridged wire into the hole. As you turn the dial the wire will enter the gates and hold them in place. Once the wire enters the first gate, reverse direction and it will insert into the next gate after several turns. Repeat  until you have trapped the four gates. At this point remove the wire and turn your key. It should open up...if not insert the wire an move it up and down to better align the gates. Let us know how you make out."
WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,NewEnglandCracker,2,Sun Feb 15 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Wow great info, thanks!  I had read that most consumer fire saves aren't super secure, so maybe drilling isn't such a daunting task. To be honest, even if the combo is ruined, it would still act as a visual deterrent while it will still be at least semi useful with the key lock intact.  What about the jamming feeling in the dial when I apply tension on the handle (the key lock)? Does it indicate anything about the internal workings or could this be a separate phenomena?"
WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,alfalfasprouts,2,Sun Feb 15 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"If you were careful and plugged the hole when you were done, the safe would still be lockable (ie that dial lock would still function) and marginally secure."

It may have false gates to hinder finding the actual correct one. I'll try to find a photo of the workings of the lock and post it."

OP will have a working safe when done."
WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,Diabolico,9,Tue Feb 17 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"I have a safe that closely resembles this one.  Here's a small album of the locking mechanism so you know what you're probably working with.  http://imgur.com/a/iVuBb  The plate at the bottom covers the locking mechanism for the keyed part, which I understand you've got handled.  That key moves the entire place, withdrawing the deadbolt and sliding into the aligned gates of the combination lock.  This would be trivial to open if you drilled it.  In my safe, at least, the dial for the last number of the combination is larger than the others, so that applying pressure to the key will reveal the last number, but locks you out of figuring out any other numbers because the dial binds up on the last combination number, rendering it mostly useless."
WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,Diabolico,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:32:26 2015 UTC,I was expecting the wafers to be a lot more delicate! Do you fell any kind of feedback in the dial when you apply pressure on the key or handle?
WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,NewEnglandCracker,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:56:14 2015 UTC,If I torque the key and turn the dial I get some friction until it lands on the gate.  At that point I get a hard click and the dial lock at the final number.  No other feedback is possible because you can't turn the dial anymore without releasing the key.  The bar never contacts any other disc unless the combination has already been dialed.

WhatsInThisThing,2vytuk,Diabolico,1 point,Wed Feb 18 12:54:06 2015 UTC,"following this post on a (presumably) similar direct-drive lock, I've figured out a means to find the depth of each gate using a pointer. However I'm not having too much luck - is it naive to assume that the number ranges where it seizes up with torque correspond in any way to the combo?   This method would not produce any results on my safe.  There are no false gates, although if there were it would not improve the situation.  By simply making one disk larger than the others this sort of manipulation is rendered only barely better than simply brute forcing the combination.  When you torque the key and turn the dial, does the wheel lock for you at any point?  At more than one point?"

WhatsInThisThing,2usmah,droznig,2,Thu Feb 5 12:09:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that recent one about the bean was fucking brilliant. Gave me a laugh. Not like we have a ton of content here anyway.
WhatsInThisThing,2usmah,ViperCodeGames,2,Thu Feb 5 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"they generally get fairly good answers, if we can't answer it here some one usually sends them on their way to what is this thing. I like that we get first bash at it even if it's the wrong sub and it's not like this sub is so busy that having a few people take a wrong turn is a problem."
WhatsInThisThing,2usmah,bobthecrusher,2,Thu Feb 5 17:30:09 2015 UTC,Agreed

WhatsInThisThing,2usmah,Rain12913,4,Wed Feb 4 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, some of them get upvotes. These votes are assuredly from posts showing within aggregated lists, homepages, etc, not from visitors browsing /r/whatsinthisthing exclusively.  The solution to this issue is moderation.

WhatsInThisThing,2unh5c,pie_eating_contest,5,Tue Feb 3 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"It looks like a older Eurovault Grade 2/3 safe.  The hinge design doesn't match current Eurovault safes, which use a rounded peg instead of the squared hinge.  Also the mirrored surface doesn't cover across the door.  The dial and the handle seem to match though, however they are positioned strangely as most Eurovaults have the handle and dial on the same axis.  However because of the small size the position might have changed.    I can't seem to find any information on whether it has a glass relocker or not.  Although most sites do say it has some kind of relocker in case of attack."

Add to that, as you spin the dial, the speed at which the numbers on the screen change is randomized... sometimes a fast quarter turn of the dial will change the number from 0 to 55, sometimes the exact same speed and distance twisted will only result in a change of 0 to 22.

WhatsInThisThing,2s2or6,Ramv36,2,Fri Jan 16 08:00:34 2015 UTC,The intention of the x-09 lock is to protect sensitive information so the owner wants to know if somebody has gained entry. Which is easy enough to do by damaging the lock. The flaw is which allows the lock to be opened and re locked without any signs of unauthorized entry.

Most of the stuff people put in them has sentimental value to those who buried it, but doesn't tell us much about the time in which they lived.  A pile of buried trash on the other hand, can tell us a wealth of information about the people who buried it and the time in which it was buried. It will have items left over from food preparation and meals, which tells us what they ate and how much. It will have worn out tools, telling us what sorts of things they used on a daily basis. It may contain written information like bills or letters, which give us a snippet of their daily lives, and so many other things. If this was a garbage pile behind Sam Adams' home, it would be amazing, instead it's just some useless junk, in pristine condition.  It's a neat thing if you're the person burying it, thinking that people X number of years from now will uncover it. If you're the person opening it, it's not all that interesting, really."

WhatsInThisThing,2qhd0f,Jrook,0,Sat Dec 27 03:52:11 2014 UTC,"Oh absolutely, because you know so much about how much money I have.  I was going to leave this alone, but since you decided to come back here and comment again, let's deconstruct your logic.   I said this person dresses like a douchebag, that's an opinion, so we can go ahead and throw that one out. You can't prove or disprove an opinion, because they aren't facts. This person, we can deduce, still lives at home, his parents' home, and drives a car belonging to his parents as well. This is evidenced by the fact that his parents have a safe located in this house, so they either own, rent, or otherwise hold the title to this house; furthermore, his father confiscated his keys, which he could not rightfully do if he did not own the car. So, both of these things indicate to me, barring any extenuating circumstances, that this person has not paid a single cent for the purchase of this house or vehicle. This person took it upon themselves to take an item that was not rightfully theirs (the safe), in order to commandeer the car, which is also (probably) not rightfully theirs, and then photographed it to brag about outsmarting his parents.   The culmination of these deductions indicates to me that this individual is a spoiled tool.  Now then, on the topic of me being jealous, well, quite frankly that's laughable. I currently have a very nice apartment, all of which I have furnished with my own earnings from my job. I own a car, which I will be swapping out for a newer, nicer model this summer, once again, funded by my own money. I also recently purchased a part for my computer valued at nearly $400 on a whim, because I have that disposable income. Once more I need to inject opinion here, but I own nicer clothing, that costs more money than the outfit in these pictures, and I paid for it with my own money. One could say I live quite comfortably, and I earned these things, by applying myself and dedicating myself to my work. Aside from being comfortable, I'm also quite happy, and at my age, my earnings have not peaked, so there is more to come for me.  Do those things make me a pretentious ass? Quite possibly. That's a character trait that I'll accept, because I didn't have these things handed to me, and when I still lived with my parents, I was thankful and respectful enough to not do something like what this spoiled little tool did.  TL;DR: You don't know me, so get over yourself before you tell me to get over myself."

But sometimes I would still like to be a part of things, even though I have no means to actually pay for it. Getting a credit card is opening up a whole different can of worms that I just don't want to deal with right now anyway.  With the low paying jobs I have had sometimes a new game for example will cost me almost two weeks pay. When literally 90% of that pay goes towards rent and the rest goes to food / petrol I would be screwing myself over to buy just one game for my computer that was bought for me as a gift. Imagine how much worse it would be if I buy one of these many many games that are famously released in such a buggy state that they are barely playable. I might as well spend that money on booze and piss it out.  With some of the games I have downloaded pirated copies of I have been absolutely glad I pirated because spending precious money on them would have been an absolute waste of my life in a literal sense, I cannot afford to be a rabid consumer. Others I would gladly pay for twice if I could and I will when I can.  There are also other reasons for piracy, in gaming at least, such as ROMs for Sega and Nintendo emulators. There is just no other way to acquire them because those companies don't support emulation. Yet it is something that a large part of the gaming community desires and the service is available. If those companies offered a service for people buy roms from the entire catalogue and supported emulation, there would still be piracy as usual but they would also find a huge amount of willing customers. But for that right now, piracy is the only way because those companies would rather sit on their 20+ year old property and hope they squeeze a few more golden eggs from it then allow it to be available easily for all."

I don't know if the keys shown are the actual launch keys, I'd guess not, as they would probably be within the lock box. They probably don't actually unlock the lock box, as the MCCC and DMCCC would probably carry those with them.  The thing on the right is part of a radio (probably).  MCCC probably stands for Missile Combat Crew Commander and DMCCC is probably the deputy.  The lock box would require two people to unlock it and would probably include the information necessary to verify an Emergency War Order (orders to arm or fire nuclear weapons), tactical information on targeting (see SIOP) and the keys to arm the Permissive Action Links."
WhatsInThisThing,2qbq0q,Puppier,2,Thu Dec 25 02:55:27 2014 UTC,"Yes, the thing on the right is all communication equipment that works using the different antenna on (or just under) the surface outside the silo.  After getting a coded broadcast over the radio they'd go over and unlock the safe, pull out the appropriate envelope based on the message received, and then crack it open to verify the received message.  The launch keys were in the safe too.  All of the targets (3 options) were pre-loaded in the targeting system and the crew actually had no idea where the ICBM would go when fired. They just turned the keys.  There's also a code that gets dialed into a thingy that unlocks one of the four butterfly valves on the missile. That code came over the radio, it wasn't in the safe.  You can visit the safe yourself, it's part of the Titan Missile Museum south of Tucson: http://www.titanmissilemuseum.org/"

Cam locks/wafer locks have a huge range in terms of how easy they are to pick. Some will basically open if you stick anything which approximates the dimensions of the key in there, some of them not.  I would advise against forcing it open though as many filing cabinets have locking mechanisms which only allow for one drawer to open at a time, if you force it you may damage this and inadvertently jam all the drawers but one.   Edit: Once it is open you should be able to replace the lock easily enough with one that you do have a key for."

For a Star safe you would then push in on the dial and continue turning clockwise till the lugs retract. Worth a try, since there's a remote possibility someone was nice and reset the combo to industry default before moving out, but it's not likely.   The other option for some safes is to get a professional locksmith to call the manufacturer and get the factory combination based on the serial number. If the combo was never changed, it'd still work. In this case though, you are out of luck. When Amsec bought Star safe, there was a fire at the storage facility during transition, and all the factory combinations were lost for safes with serial number 370 000 or lower.

WhatsInThisThing,2njl7u,ROKMWI,1 point,Sun Feb 8 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"Whether it is a big assumption or not is an opinion. Whether you think it is a big assumption or not might depend on whether you take things others say literally, or whether you tend to interpret the most likely meaning of what people say. Some people tend to take others literally all the time, and get upset when people are not literal with them (How was I supposed to know you didn't really mean what you said?). People like this tend to make better mathmeticians and scientists, because they have the ability to take information for face value, even when it makes no sense to them based on what they already know. Other people (who tend to be more extroverted, or socially-oriented), don't want to commit the social faux-pas of misunderstanding someone, when the speaker's actual meaning is fairly obvious if you just put yourself in the place of the speaker, nor do they want to commit the social faux pas of looking like they are calling someone  out for technically saying something ""wrong."" People like this may be more likely to just go with what seems to be (in their experience) the most obvious interpretation of what the other person said, whether it is the most accurate interpretation of what was said or not. People like this make good diplomats, and other professions that require good people skills. Even when making my above posting, I realized that I was making an assumption, but in my experience, it is more likely that someone who cannot figure out the answer to that relatively simple question is the same person who also doesn't realize that when estimating how long something like this will take, every single combination represents the absolute maximum amount of time it could possibly take. Since the literal answer had already been given (so if that is really what they wanted, they had their answer), I thought it might be a good idea to give them the opportunity to learn why that answer may not be as useful as they thought it would be."

WhatsInThisThing,2njl7u,AsterJ,2,Thu Nov 27 23:07:49 2014 UTC,"I'd say it's 60XX but not sure if that has any significance.  The features I see are: - A normal distributed vertical line for years 19XX - 20XX - Block in the bottom left for 365 dates MMDD and the mirrored DDMM  (you can see february with only 28 days) - Diagonal line for repeated pairs of digits with very bright spots at 1111, 2222, 3333, etc.  (unsurprisingly 6969 is also very bright) - Lower numbers are more popular for every digit - Other bright dots at stringed PINs like 1234, 4567,  8520 (this one is a vertical path on a numpad)"

Lower numbers are more popular for every digit    Did you derive that from how it has that sorta checkerboard shape, with light colors at the bottom left?

WhatsInThisThing,2njl7u,AsterJ,1 point,Sun Dec 7 04:39:10 2014 UTC,"6666 is 3 to the bottom left of 6969, both are pretty bright     For the lower numbers thing. you can see the trend easiest in the first and third digit since those are in a more significant position in the graph.  Looking past the other trends you can see the vertical and horizontal band for 1st/3rd digit 0 is pretty dark, the band for 1 is very bright, and the higher bands are not as bright.  I'm assuming the checkerboard pattern is from this trend holding for the 2nd and 4th digits.  The least popular PIN I think is 8068.  But I'm not sure if the color scale is linear so it may be exaggerated how black it should be."

WhatsInThisThing,2n3qoj,Viking84,3,Sun Nov 23 07:00:26 2014 UTC,"You're entitled to a fraction of the liquidation proceeds of the company representing your percentage of shares. When going out of business, everything of value is sold (liquidated), e.g. inventory, company cars, computers and other assets as well as property if there is any.  Usually companies go out of business because of a lack of funds / overindebtedness, so there's no cash left to distribute. All shareholders need to register their claims with the insolvency court until an announced date, together with all other former creditors. The court determines the percentage each faction is entitled to, determines the final liquidation amount (after deduction of court fees and lawyers - they get 100%).  When all this is done and there are still funds left to distribute, the shareholder gets his money, usually less than 10% of the original share value.  Edit: If claims are not registered until the announced date, the shares are void - which would be the case here. If claims are registered but not collected within a fixed period of time (usually 5-10 years) after the case is closed, the money is taken in by the court."

There's still the option that the company was not liquidated but actually successful and bought by a competitor who merged it into his own business. In that case the original shareholders were entitled to surrender their shares in exchange for shares of the new, joint company.  There are also deadlines involved here, but since not changing the stock doesn't block the company from operating properly those deadlines are usually very long (can be upwards of 50 years). The shares yet to be claimed are booked on a suspense account and don't to any harm; once the deadline is reached they are invalidated and so each other, actually circulated share gains a tiny amount in value.

The lock is a Mosler 302. Best drill point is 66. To open it:   Remove the dial. As memory serves it's pressed on. If you don't have an appropriate dial puller (and we both freakin know you don't) you can pry it off or you can drill in the dead center of it until the bit hits the spindle. Insert a self tapping screw into the hole and press the dial off with the tip of the screw working against the spindle. Drill point is at 66 and one inch from dial center. i.e. drill inline with where 66 would be with the dial zeroed, 1 inch from the center of the spindle. Measurements need to be pretty freakin exact. Drill a 1/4 to 3/8 hole, when you feel the bit break through into the lock box you are then going to drill the fence right off the lever.You need to go FREAKIN SLOW and you should probably use depth stops on the bit to go a little at a time so the bit doesn't slam inside the lock case and tear shit up. Once the fence is drilled away from the lever turn the dial R until the lever drops in and the safe will open in the normal way.   Before you try it I strongly suggest you cough up a few bucks and buy a Mosler 302 lock from ebay or some place so you can actually see what you are doing. You are gonna need a new lock when you get done anyway.  If you are a brute force type guy:  The spindle on this safe can also be punched knocking the wheel pack and cover right into the fucking drawer. That will trip a relocker, which is the lock makers way of saying ""fuck you asshole"". The relocker will have to be deactivated and the lever manually retracted to withdraw the bolt. Since I'm basicly a lazy prick and don't wanna explain how to do all that here is a diagram of it so you can figure it out:  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Mosler+302  Very first listing in the search scroll down the page to the Mosler 302.  Now that I told you how: If you fuck up I don't want to hear it.  If you didn't get it open yet here is a diagram of the lock and drill points for it including the fence drill point that the other poster suggested you use. This is from a reliable source who has probably forgotten more about safe cracking than most people will ever know. The drop in point is listed as 91 Mounted RH so if it is mounted VD in your application which would make sense if the handle is below the lock, the 66 that was posted would seem to be correct i.e. 90 degrees/25 numbers less than 91..  Apparently the drive cam is on the front of the lock so the fence is not directly visible from the front but from the instructions it looks like where the parts are joined together is visible. I would expect this type of container to have some sort of hardplate, especially at the drop in point, which will require you to use a carbide drill bit and if it's carbide chip hardplate or similar you might need a diamond core bit. Hopefully there is no glass relock on it ;).  http://home.earthlink.net/~drillpoint/MoslerDP+.htm  Happy safe cracking."

WhatsInThisThing,2mxgll,v8jet,1 point,Fri Nov 21 02:43:05 2014 UTC,"I should say that most of the time the dial in your picture is not attached to a 302 lock.  However, a 302 is very easy to detect as it has 2 stiff, distinct clicks every time you pass the dial near zero.  Edit: Talking about the MR-302.  There is a possibility of a CD-302 which does not have the clicks."

WhatsInThisThing,2mt04r,Zombie_Spider,3,Wed Nov 19 23:32:26 2014 UTC,"There's a few ways of doing it.  One involves punching or drilling a hole in the center, fitting it onto a metal rod and just hammering the edge until the whole thing flattens out to form a sort of T shape, then filing off the inside rim.  I don't get the point of that method, since it totally removes anything the ring had to offer, aside from the metal itself.  The method I use is to punch or drill a hole in the center and grind/file it out so that the remaining outer ring is the thickness I want the band to be (typically wide enough to retain the wording or whatever pattern will look good), placing it on a mandrel (tapered metal rod) and hammering it with a rawhide mallet, as to not mar the surface.  You then basically jut keep hammering it until it's previously flat face is turned out flat.  The inside gets mashed against the mandrel, I don't try to retain any of that detail, but some do -- they wrap the mandrel with leather first."

Would go with whoever and while they did laundry id look in the empty machines for coins. Had a hell of a foreign coin collection and a few decent US coins like liberties and morgans. Tons of wheat pennies also which i got mostly from checking every single penny that ever came through my household.  Sold a number of them years ago when i was short on rent money, didn't get much for any of them but combined they came out to a nice chunk. Still have the foreign change somewhere. Haven't seen it in a couple years but im sure its in a drawer somewhere in my house or a old box or possibly even my safe.   Never really bothered with Canadian change though. Think thats part of growing up in MI, Canadian change becomes a huge burden cause no machines take it and from experience some stores may not either. I have a large jar of Canadian change now because coinstars wont take them so i save them up till they can be rolled and deposited in my bank account. Usually mix them in with native change though."

If a customer needs to recover a combo they can contact Sentry and go through their procedure to recover it.  They require a notarized form be provided.  Now our company is registered with Sentry and we can bypass this and recover a code instantly for a small fee as long as we are convinced that we are dealing with the real owner.  We take copies of IDs and such in case there is an issue later.  But yeah give them a call and see what they can do.

Many will keep records but Cannon, for example, deletes records after a year.  Another thing to consider is the lock.  If it's mechanical (a dial) and has never been changed then you might get some help.  If it's electronic it sort of depends on the lock.  Most ha e the ability to recover the use of the lock in case it has been lost but not all.  But again, you'll only know if you call.  And look around the body of the safe for the serial number."

WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,0avava,3,Mon Nov 10 13:24:55 2014 UTC,"Those fuel elements decay, emitting neutrons. The neutrons sometimes run into more uranium and cause MORE decay. That's why they space the fuel elements out and have lots of graphite between them, to moderate the neutrons.  Now, after reviewing my physics I'm fairly certain what he did was harmless, but...  When you move one subcritical mass closer to another subcritical mass, you make it easier for the neutrons they emit to trigger each other. See criticality accident.  Actually it might be a neat experiment to place both fuel elements next to one another and see what the Geiger counter reads. Better do your math first though."
WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,Zebba_Odirnapal,24,Mon Nov 10 19:08:43 2014 UTC,"don't scare people for nothing. Do you realize that you need like 110 pounds of enriched uranium-235 before it would go critical? You can't just touch small pieces of radioactive stuff together and have it go boom.  That's why the first bombs were so hard to make. They had to work out the right shape so that the two halves, coming together, would go critical. They had to work out how to set off explosives so the explosives would condense the core so they wouldn't need as much. It's super hard to make radioactive material go critical.  Frightening people with this kind of bullshit is why people are so against nuclear power.  I agree it's not smart to put radioactive stuff next to other radioactive stuff but don't imply that it's somehow unpredictable and could ""go off"" at any time, it's very easy to be safe with these materials if you follow really basic rules."
WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,0avava,14,Tue Nov 11 02:51:07 2014 UTC,Never expected it to go boom. Only concern was a prompt radiation dose. I know those fuel elements aren't plutonium.

You're worried about nothing."
WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,0avava,5,Mon Nov 10 15:32:37 2014 UTC,You know as well as I that there's a huge range between seeing a blue flash vs. simply causing more fissions than is healthy. You would not want to carry around one of those fuel elements in your pocket all day long. Putting two of 'em next to one another will only increase the fission rate.  I sure hope that you keep your cowboy attitude well away from the nuclear industry.
WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,bahgheera,2,Mon Nov 10 15:41:24 2014 UTC,"I don't have a 'cowboy attitude', don't be hyperbolic. I'm telling you that with knowledge of what material you're working with, those things in the video are no more dangerous than changing a fuse at the fuse box at home. The risk is manageable and if you take care to turn the mains off before you start work (ie. if you take care to work with only small quantities of radioactive material), then there is ZERO chance of any ""blue flash"", ""boom"" or dangerous fission rate.  You're trying to make out like i'm not safety conscious or that I am missing some basic detail, as if I don't understand that it's unwise to put these things in your pocket all day. I didn't do anything to deserve that, it's presumptuous and I don't like it."

WhatsInThisThing,2lu6wj,diversionmary,2,Mon Nov 10 22:00:39 2014 UTC,"Criticality accident:       A criticality accident is an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. It is sometimes referred to as a critical excursion or a critical power excursion and represents the unintentional assembly of a critical mass of a given fissile material, such as enriched uranium or plutonium, in an unprotected environment. A critical or supercritical fission reaction (one that is sustained in power or increasing in power) generally only occurs inside reactor cores and occasionally within test environments; a criticality accident occurs when the same reaction is achieved unintentionally and in an unsafe environment. Though dangerous and frequently lethal to humans within the immediate area, the critical mass formed is still incapable of producing a nuclear detonation of the type seen in fission bombs, as the reaction lacks the many engineering elements that are necessary to induce explosive supercriticality. The heat released by the nuclear reaction will typically cause the fissile material to expand, so that the nuclear reaction becomes subcritical again within a few seconds.

It's not the fastest way, but if you don't want to damage it I'd think that would be the best bet, plus if I remember from the other thread where someone rented an autodialer they were also able to recover the combination and continue to use the safe.  It might be a couple hundred, but in this case that might be worth the money to get to what's inside."
WhatsInThisThing,2loxrj,LockManipulator,1 point,Sun Nov 9 01:23:58 2014 UTC,How does an auto dialer work?
WhatsInThisThing,2loxrj,PriceZombie,3,Sun Nov 9 03:44:47 2014 UTC,"Like this!  The locksmith comes to your place, mounts the device to the safe, sets it up, turns it on, and leaves.  You call them back when it stops dialing and thinks it has the right combination and they'll come back and see if it did it properly.  On the off chance it hit a false positive, they'll start it back up and repeat.  It can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple days depending on various factors, but it's probably the easiest and least destructive way to get in a safe you've lost the combination to.  It's a few minutes of setup and then you just go about your day and check back on the thing every now and then to see if it's still happily spinning away or if it stopped.  There are some combination lock types it can't open, but you have access to the safe so giving the locksmith that model number will let them be able to find out quickly if the autodialer is compatible with it or not."
WhatsInThisThing,2loxrj,LockManipulator,2,Sun Nov 9 04:40:19 2014 UTC,Short answer? Robot in a suitcase dials all possible combinations sequentially until it hits the one that opens the safe.
WhatsInThisThing,2loxrj,ExcessivelyLP,0,Sun Nov 9 04:23:20 2014 UTC,Do you remember if they said from where or the type of business/store they rented the autodialer?
WhatsInThisThing,2loxrj,darngooddogs,1 point,Mon Nov 10 06:17:01 2014 UTC,"As mentioned below in this same thread, a locksmith.  You find a locksmith that has an autodialer.  Since it's a piece of equipment that's generally only sold to bonded locksmiths and law enforcement agencies, it's the locksmith that comes to set it up and pick it back up once it unlocks the safe.  You aren't renting the machine directly yourself, you are paying the locksmith to hook it up for a day or so.  Just call up your local locksmiths, explain you have a safe in your ownership that you don't have the combination but would like to open in a non-destructive manner, and ask if they have an autodialer they could come install on it.  Not every locksmith will have this thing sitting around, but a lot do.  It could be that this safe happens to be a model that can't be autodialed (at least by the ITL2000 I linked a video of and has been used successfully on a safe belonging to one Redditor in this subreddit before), but it's always worth asking.  Any locksmith who has this device in their possession will be able to tell you from the model of the safe if it will work or not.  If it isn't compatible with the autodialer they have, then you'll have to look into alternate methods like drilling to get it open.  Still, in your situation, destroying the safe for incriminating evidence might be worth it in the end."

WhatsInThisThing,2kg3i0,kennerly,7,Mon Oct 27 20:03:46 2014 UTC,Your best bet for now is to just cut the thing out of the wall and take it with you.  It looks like a standard wall safe so it is probably just anchored between two studs.  Cut out the drywall around it and then either unscrew it from the studs or cut the studs and replace repair them.  You can just cut a new 2x4 to replace the cut pieces and then use brackets to secure them to the existing studs.  Then cut a piece of drywall to match the hole and mud and paint.  Pretty simple.  I think you'll need more time than you have to figure out what is in that safe.

WhatsInThisThing,2kaf2j,TravestyTravis,8,Sat Oct 25 17:20:39 2014 UTC,"Never seen one for rent. They're basically a locksmith tool, so anyone trying to rent one out would likely run the risk of pretty nasty liability for misuse, even if they didn't run afoul of any of the various state laws making it a crime to hand out entry tools to unlicensed people. Generally the way it works is you call a locksmith who specializes in safes, and he shows up with his ITL 2000 dialer, verifies that this is, in fact, probably your safe, and then personally sets it up to dial for a couple days."
WhatsInThisThing,2kaf2j,Dug_Fin,9,Sat Oct 25 16:59:27 2014 UTC,How much does renting the dude to setup his autodialer at your house cost?

WhatsInThisThing,2kaf2j,duh_bomb,8,Sat Oct 25 17:08:45 2014 UTC,"On a combination lock like they use on safes, you dial your three numbers and then turn the dial clockwise to '0', at which point the internal fence drops into the gates and the bolt retracts. When the bolt retracts, the dial will not turn any farther. The ITL 2000 dialer tries each combo and turns back to '0' each time to see if the fence drops in. If the dial doesn't stop, the combo isn't right, so it goes on to the next number.  S&G has an interesting PDF on how to service and troubleshoot these looks, and explains how they work fairly well."

The reason for my previous comment is because to me, using an autodialer versus manipulating it is like a chef throwing a frozen pizza in the oven and slow cooking it for hours (idk who slow cooks a pizza) instead of making it from scratch. It's faster, easier (only one trip!), and more fun to manipulate it! He charged them extra money, wasted gas and time driving back and forth, and it took him no skill whatsoever."
WhatsInThisThing,2kaf2j,v8jet,0,Sun Oct 26 04:46:11 2014 UTC,"Sure, it makes me money but nothing significant   Given that I doubt there's anything in it that's not already available from the Matt Blaze guide for free, I'd say it's kind of sleazy. But hey, a buck's a buck.   to me, using an autodialer versus manipulating it is like a chef throwing a frozen pizza in the oven and slow cooking it for hours (idk who slow cooks a pizza) instead of making it from scratch. It's faster, easier (only one trip!), and more fun to manipulate it!   Some people don't have the patience or the fine motor skills to do manipulation, and for others the opportunity cost of learning isn't worth it.  My old boss bought an ITL 2000 because his eyesight had deteriorated to where he could no longer accurately gauge variations in contact points. I've manipulated a few open for fun, but the bulk of our business was high-end electronic access control, so it really didn't make sense to devote a lot of time to safes. For the majority of professional locksmiths, dropping a couple grand on a tool is cheaper than devoting time to develop a skill that they'll rarely use.   He charged them extra money   If you're charging less than $300 to manipulate open a safe, you're grossly undervaluing your own skill. Safe opening isn't really one of those things where you'll get more work the less you charge. You're certainly not going to get 3x the work at $100 as you will at $300. If you're good at manipulating safes, you're seriously selling yourself short if you think $300 is too much! The one thing I've learned in the business is that you're not doing yourself any favors by grossly undercharging. Cheap prices attract cheap people, and there's no worse customer to work for than a cheapskate."

There were a few smaller safes though the building that held different amounts of monies for their various fund raisers in their bar (pull tabs, ""bell jar"", etc).  The arson investigators needed the safes open to see if anything had been taken from them as part of their investigation (was this a vengeful arson, or an arson to cover a burglary).  Some of the front of the safes were too damaged to use the dials, and they didn't want to get a locksmith involved unless they had to.  So we pulled our hydraulic extrication equipment off out rescue (aka the ""Jaws of Life"" and proceeded to open the safes as needed.  We did have to cut off a door on one as it had a nice ""V"" burn pattern where it looked like a fire was ignited right infront of the safe.  tl:dr version: ""Jaws of Life"" open safes up real fast"

WhatsInThisThing,2j6yq3,Red_Dawn_2012,3,Tue Oct 14 12:25:37 2014 UTC,"Specifically the serial # is printed with a dot-matrix style printer.  Which didn't exist in the 1950s.  Heck, they barely existed in the 1970s.  I would expect that serial # tag alone to indicate the 1980s at the earliest, and they're still in use in some fields today.  Then there's the plastic handle.  In the 1950s, they didn't have that kind of plastic yet.  Maybe in the 1970s you could get something to look like that, but again it's the 1980s where that kind of plastic becomes common.  Then there's the color scheme.  In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, nobody would use that color scheme.  I'm not sure that color blue/cyan for the ""On Guard"" part of the safe was even invented until the 80s.  And the font is pretty modern, looking more 90s than 80s.  Here's what safes looked like in the 1950s.  They're not even close."

WhatsInThisThing,2j6yq3,didzisk,1 point,Wed Oct 15 04:25:17 2014 UTC,"It looks wrong. You cut the hinges, but the door still seems to be attached to the box. And the bolts are retracted, aren't they? Given that the body of the box isn't damaged, it looks more like the door was stuck rather than locked.  Alternatively - if you were able to open the locked box, then it's more likely a fire safe, and not a proper safe (the difference is that very few fire safes offer proper attack protection).  Oh, and the hinges don't look like safe hinges either. A safe has to be heavy (due to all the protection), it means the door has to be heavy, and the hinges are usually much more heavy duty to support all the weight."
WhatsInThisThing,2j6yq3,BartMaster1234,9,Wed Oct 15 21:16:38 2014 UTC,"Found this.   If your safe has a dial combination lock, follow the directions below, to open. You must be careful not to over-turn the dial to each number, but if you do, you'll need to start over. 'Clockwise' means turn to the right and 'counterclockwise' means turn to the left.  Set the dial at zero, then turn the dial counter-clockwise three times. Go past zero for a full rotation. On the fourth rotation stop on the first number of the combination. For example, if the first number is XXXXX turn the dial past zero three times and stop on the number 10 during the fourth rotation. Turn the dial clockwise two times, stopping on the second number in the combination during the third rotation. Do not go back to zero before you begin the counter-clockwise rotation. Start at the first number of the combination. Turn the dial counter-clockwise once, stopping on the third number during the second rotation. Turn the dial clockwise until it stops. Your Chubb combination safe will now be accessible.  The standard combination on Chubb safes is 10-20-30, but it can be reset.  You can email the company for further information, here: http://www.chubbsafes.com/contactform/Pages/default.aspx"

WhatsInThisThing,2i4p1g,Deadfreeman,3,Fri Oct 3 00:58:22 2014 UTC,This needs to be at the top. Everyone else seems to be suggesting to drill the safe which would prevent it from being locked again. Also if you pick it you might be able to replace the lock with a real key making the safe somewhat useful.  This may sound a little silly but the lock pick could illegal in your state. So you may need a lock smith to pick it.
WhatsInThisThing,2i4p1g,weirdlooking,3,Fri Oct 3 10:54:33 2014 UTC,All reasons we suggest drilling it. Drilling the old lock and replacing it with similar would cost less than an hour of a locksmiths time.

WhatsInThisThing,2i4p1g,cybergibbons,1 point,Thu Oct 2 23:05:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, drilling would be quick and easy.  These locks are rarely hardened.

WhatsInThisThing,2hqwja,genghisknom,4,Mon Sep 29 01:51:39 2014 UTC,That's not how trees grow. There is no root flair on the round shown it was not near the roots anyway.
WhatsInThisThing,2hqwja,Obeeeee,2,Mon Sep 29 02:17:51 2014 UTC,"Trees grow out, not up. It has to have been placed inside/on the tree at that height and the tree grew outward around it."
WhatsInThisThing,2hqwja,purplelephant,1 point,Mon Sep 29 08:55:12 2014 UTC,I've seen what trees do to fences and concrete. I don't believe it would be that.. (non-warped?) saved from mutilation through slow pressure if the tree molded itself around it. It doesn't look squished enough in the pictures.
WhatsInThisThing,2hqwja,CeeSea2525,1 point,Mon Sep 29 11:17:00 2014 UTC,"It's dab in the center, so unless it moved around it's been there for pretty much the entire lifetime of the tree.  It's malleable and soft, so it would just give in, the air inside the container helps as well."
WhatsInThisThing,2hqwja,theserial,1 point,Mon Sep 29 17:20:03 2014 UTC,"Meh. I doubt it. Young trees are pretty thin and non-hollow. It's not like it got caught in the root structure, that's definitely the trunk.  Heh. I love arguing about trivial stuff with people on the internet. Neither of us have any deep insight nor inside info on why this would be here, but we can still argue about it's origin like we're experts and nobody will bat an eye.   <3 reddit.  EDIT  Looked at the pics again, that thing was definitely from a section of trunk multiple feet away from the ground, not the base log root structure, unlike what I thought earlier. Also, you can tell by the other logs in the background that this tree was clearly quite hollow for some time.   I think this further backs up my theory of the toy being dropped by a careless child into this tree less than 30 years ago, when the tree was old enough to have a hollow part (and a hole from the outside in) but old enough for a 1987 toy to be around to be dropped in.  FYI a tree of about 21"" diameter (as I'm eyeballing this to be) is about 110 years old."

WhatsInThisThing,2h1rp3,noshamefuckit,2,Mon Sep 22 05:51:31 2014 UTC,"Okay learning time. ..  if you found a really old box of c4 let's say for instance in the desert, and it's been there for a decade. The heat will cause the RDX (this is the explosive inside c4) to bleed out of the c4. Thus making it way less effective and less stable. If the box of c4 were to be climate controlled it would last a very long time. We have used c4 from the Vietnam War era. It worked but it wasn't as good of quality. In terms of malleability.  Even in perfect conditions it will eventually become to unstable to use. Something we refer to as a splatter effect will occur. Thus making the explosive less powerful. Because the RDX is not in its original place inside the c4. Which means there could be gaps and the RDX will blow the buffer (plasticizers) into the other RDX but it will not cause it to explode because it Is to far away. Yes even a few inches could cause the explosion not to travel to the end of the line of c4. If you put 2 brand new c4 blocks next to each other about 3 feet away and blew up on, the other will not explode most of the time."

He doesn't think about going back to get it because he knows there's only about $10 worth of coins inside.  Last week he thought about it again---and he wanted to go find it. Not because he thought it would have value, but because he wanted to touch his youth again, just one more time, when $10 was an immense treasure that must be buried to protect it from now-deceased, thieving sisters and uncles.  I dunno, it's really neat. For some reason I find it immensely sad. I can't tell if I hope it was some sort of Stand By Me thing where the original owner dug 500 holes looking for it, or if I hope he buried it in haste. Maybe it was a wife burying escape money. Maybe a house burned, maybe it fell out of a moving box, maybe it was stolen and dropped in a chase. It's awesome to think about, but I can't help thinking that the story is probably sad."

You could try to learn how to manipulate combination locks, but because you don't know if this one works or not, you will have a hard time."

Interestingly, the dial goes from 1-130. Normally it is 1-100.   It's almost certainly a 3 wheel lock, so 3 digits need dialling. Rare for anything of this age to have much in the way of anti-manipulation.  The big issue still is if it works or not. If the handle has been snapped off, who knows what has happened to the lock."

WhatsInThisThing,2gim6a,malphonso,3,Tue Sep 16 11:13:27 2014 UTC,"Yes, hence the issue. Manipulating the lock means that you can work out the combination. But if the lock is damaged, or the locking mechanism broken, or the relockers have fired, you will likely be frustrated."
WhatsInThisThing,2gim6a,Zebleblic,1 point,Tue Sep 16 11:15:12 2014 UTC,It is my belief that there are no relockers on this particular HHM safe.  The only thing close is a gravity-based mechanism so that the safe has to be upright to turn the lever.

I don't know know where the drop in is on a 130 dial, and a handle must be put on to open it and I guarantee it broke due to vandalism. The safe lock does have relockers and this safe has to be drilled a certain type of way. It would take a while and I added some time for the unknowns.

WhatsInThisThing,2gej7z,RSVive,18,Sun Sep 14 21:55:21 2014 UTC,"I think the lock is made by Picard. It has three combinations that need setting and a key.  You use the key to turn each of the three combinations in turn. You turn all the way to either the right or left, then count the clicks. IIRC there are between 16 and 30 clicks on the dials. It varies, some of these have four wheels.  Then you use the key in the centre lock. It's a Fichet style lock where slots in the key press forwards, like a tubular lock. They are common in France.  It's not that hard to pick/dial, but you'll need someone quite specialist.  I don't know anything about the safe itself, but it is unlikely to be worth much. The lock might fetch something though.  If you want it opened and not damaged, try a local safe engineer. If you struggle with that, and you are in Europe, I can put you in touch with someone who will travel to open it, but it wouldn't be cheap."

Back in the day, you'd have only one telephone in the house, and if you were out back on your porch, you wouldn't hear it ringing. Alternatively, but in the same line of thought, you wouldn't hear the doorbell ring if you were out back. By hooking this bell up to either, the problem is solved."

Thieves can sometimes just spend a minute grabbing things near the door and running before the police show up. The external alarm draws attention to them by nearby people during the act so you have a better chance of the thieves being seen or even leaving before taking anything.

WhatsInThisThing,2fx6z0,GrilledCheezus71,8,Tue Sep 9 18:43:37 2014 UTC,Depending on the type of copper you have it can be quite profitable.  Copper #1 usually goes for about $1.90/lb at the recycling plant.  Copper wire isn't very profitable but copper tubing is where the money is at.  That is what scrappers are usually after.
WhatsInThisThing,2fx6z0,kennerly,6,Tue Sep 9 18:47:42 2014 UTC,Copper wiring is very valuable if you strip it down. Its all clean #1 copper. Even if you dont strip it they will still buy it for a good amount of money. My buddy is in the electricians union and as an apprentice they would give him as much as they could spare and all the scrap. He made several hundred dollars every couple weeks with this.
WhatsInThisThing,2fx6z0,Fugitivelama,7,Tue Sep 9 19:54:51 2014 UTC,"in Ohio, at it's peak #1 was close to $4.00/lb. most of it was in wiring. thieves MO would be to find an abandoned house or trailer, or a hunting camp, or even if they knew you'd be gone all day and go to work. They'd hit the circuit breaker mains, and then take a crowbar and bolt cutter and rip all of the wiring they could out THROUGH the walls. People would return to having thousands of dollars of repairs in rewiring and wall repair.  The process for cleaning copper wiring is to throw it all in a pit, pour some gasoline on it and set it on fire. Plastic will burn away, copper stays.   Source: Personal experience."

The specific name means ""honey-making,"" and this species is well known as one of the very few insects other than bees to produce and store honey. It is a dark wasp with some yellow bands on the abdomen, and very fine, slightly shining golden-brown pubescence on the body. They are 7-9 millimeters in length and have less hair than the Western Honeybee. Similar to the Honeybee, the Mexican Honey Wasp is one of the few wasps that produce honey. Although they are honey producers, many people do not eat wasp honey because it can sometimes be toxic if the wasps harvest nectar and pollen from Datura plants.

So take from that what you will.   The reason why I took everything down was at the request of the Sheriff. It's a lot of stuff relevant to an ongoing case now and they politely asked me to do it so I figure that it would be wise to do so. If further news does happen and it's figured out, I do have permission to scan the reports and show them online after the case is closed. Though I do hope it doesn't get too news or media involved. I really don't want to deal with that. For the most part I'm hesitant to do much anyways. The death threats, insults, people following and neg karmaing any non-tape related post wears me down. I've got no real reason to lie as it doesn't benefit me at all. If I were to go this bassackwards way of promoting something I made it would only fail due to angry mob mentality. I hate stuff like that and wouldn't want to do something like that.   It is rather amusing that I've gone from a film promoter, to a viral marketing manager, to a troll, to an actor, and now apparently a director of a low budget indie flick. I don't even own a camcorder. The only thing I ever made was electro house and dubstep and that was 4 years ago.

Those photos on the site and in the video are taken of the parts of the tunnels that have already been wired up with lighting and open to the public for 45 years and have nothing significant to do with what this guy found under his house.  This is roughly equivalent to someone discovering that their house was built on top of a branch of  the Carlsbad caverns.. really not that newsworthy.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derinkuyu_Underground_City

Extending to a depth of approximately 60 m, it was large enough to shelter approximately 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores. It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found across Cappadocia.

Make sure to keep track of where your app is in the process of trying numbers ;) E.g. if you get a power outage you don't want to miss any combinations. Also you might try starting from the middle out or randomizing the combinations so you don't waste all your time going through the first 90% without success. And lastly I recommend a battery backup in case you have a power outage.  Edit: Also you might want to get a practice safe of an identical model or similar to test on. Another thing that could happen is that without a successful control test your software / system might not pick up the successful combination."

Are any of the possible combinations more likely?  If so, how and why?  You definitely want to do more likely ones first.  If not, why is any given ""first 90%"" more likely than a different one to miss the combination?

WhatsInThisThing,2f49xw,Toiler_in_Darkness,2,Mon Sep 1 07:16:14 2014 UTC,I'm just saying it's probably not 1-1-1 and it's probably not 100-100-100. So by randomizing you are going with some chance that OP might get lucky.
WhatsInThisThing,2f49xw,Year3030,2,Mon Sep 1 12:03:29 2014 UTC,"I'm just saying it's probably not 1-1-1 and it's probably not 100-100-100.   AFAIK: it's equally unlikely to be any given possible combination.    If this is true, 50-50-50 is as likely as 1-1-1 and 100-100-100.  They're also exactly as likely as 12-53-37 or 82-26-59.  Given that, starting from the front, back, middle, outsides, or random selection makes no difference.    Order makes no statistical difference when brute forcing random passwords!  If the passwords are non-random, then there's no point changing the order unless you can characterize how they are non-random and respond to that.  Like using a dictionary attack; it can be very effective if non-randomness exists.  This is why I asked if and how they were non-random."
WhatsInThisThing,2f49xw,Toiler_in_Darkness,0,Mon Sep 1 20:23:58 2014 UTC,"Technically you are correct, but since we are dealing with a mechanical device created by humans I think we can calculate in some non-universal logic. Specifically I'm saying that it's doubtful this safe company created a completely flat distribution of all safe combinations. Also the owner could have reset this to be his lucky numbers. So yes order doesn't matter but it wouldn't hurt to randomize since I don't think the combo will be 1-1-1, or 1-1-2 etc. OP will just waste time with these cycles and will increase his odds by starting middle out or randomizing."

This is statistical nonsense.  If he went through the codes ""sequentially"" and the actual combo is in the last 10%, that'd be a bummer.  But the odds are just as likely* that when trying the combos completely randomly, the combination would still be found in the last 10%.  *: I'm sure there are particular details of safe dial/combination design that make some combinations much more likely than others, but I suspect that those details don't affect the statistical distribution of possible/likely combinations enough to make a ""completely random"" brute force method any faster than ""try all combos in order""."

Then when the executor of the estate handled the house & move, the safe stayed. OP gets keys and finds safe.   Not to say that happened here, but it is a very reasonable explanation."
WhatsInThisThing,2ef3o0,abqnm666,3,Sun Aug 24 04:57:02 2014 UTC,"I'm renting the house. The place was completely furnished when I moved in. My landlord said we can keep whatever we want and get rid of whatever we didn't want. It seems like she didn't even do much in the way of examining the contents of the house. The safe was tucked away into the corner of a deep closet, with the front of it facing a wall. I had to remove a lot of clutter to get to it. I would like to try to open it without destroying the lock so I can sell it. It's in great shape."
WhatsInThisThing,2ef3o0,allranger,2,Mon Aug 25 03:20:44 2014 UTC,"Sounds like the landlord just didn't want to deal with anything.   As for getting it open, probably going to need a professional if you don't want to damage it. Not sure what documentation they may need to prove ownership though."

At the open houses in my neighborhood either the place is completely empty or it has the owners possessions still in it.  I wouldn't want someone going through my drawers and closets, and some realtors will tell you that straight away.  If you really need to see something you can ask and they will tell you about it or see if they can move it.  Sliding aside someones coat on a rack to see how deep the closet is, is one thing.  Moving stuff out of the closet just so you can see the back of it, well that's weird."

We didn't really speak for about an hour, when my mate came out with, 'so dude what's in your suitcase?', and of course he said what we were all expecting, 'none of your fucking business'.

WhatsInThisThing,2e7kc3,RschDev,2,Fri Aug 22 17:44:24 2014 UTC,"No, if you write bring a lock code in to a locksmith they will cut you a code key. If the cabinet owner wanted protection they wouldn't be using an 5 dollar lock, they would have a medico or something similar installed. Now things like combinations for master combo locks from the code on the back of the lock is something that we always required the physical lock to be present. Vehicle keys also had a layer of protection as well. Cabinet locks are very low on the totem poll for security, especially when the code series are very limited, meaning that tens of thousands of that same exact key for that same lock are out there.   So to answer your question, there is nothing stopping you from having code keys cut for any lock out there with the code stamped on the front. So things like filing cabinets, ski racks, tool boxes, gas caps, the list goes on and on.   Another example of a very common lock is the utility cabinet locks on pretty much every single RV out there. I'm just guesstimating here but about 98% of them use the exact same key which is also used for hundreds of other types of locks. A lot of people all have the exact same key on their keyring for different things."

I'd never picked any kind of lock but a paperclip with a very very small 90 degree bend on one end and a straight head eye glass screw driver to apply pressure to the pins opened one up for me in less then 5 minutes. I would recommend watching a youtube video first to get a feel for how the tumblers work tho.

They could at least confirm that it came from a lodge and might possibly be able to find out the combination if anyone is still around that belonged to that lodge.  Should you decide to hire a professional you may be able to talk them I to covering some of the cost as long as you gave them access to the contents.  Chances are there is nothing in there of any value to you but to them there could be valuable records about the past history of the lodge it came from.

If they drill in the wrong place, the lock will be severely damaged. I have opened several of these exact safes in the past, they are great works of art.

I can pass the information along to my friend but ultimately the decision is his.

The basic charge to open that safe is $300. That price is if I am allowed to drill a 5/16"" hole into the face of the safe. The hole would be filled in when I'm done. That opening would normally take about one hour, start to finish. The second way to open it is by feel, and that charge is $1,000 and would take anywhere from one to six hours to complete.  This option is tricky,  because some older locks are so worn that they just don't give good enough feedback to allow successful  opening. The only other safe technician closer to you that I can recommend,  is Adams Lock and Safe in Concord, NH.  Feel free to keep in touch or ask more questions."

Same principle as long hair and baggy clothes, only much closer to the working parts and it cuts a lot of the feeling in your hands.

Some sparks are larger and hotter than others and can cause you enough surprise for your hands to jerk. Now, ideally, your hands aren't in the path of any sparks, but depending on how constrained the environment is, you may not have a choice.

Put the punch in the hole and strike it hard once. Rotate the door to the next bolt, strike that one hard once. Rotate and do it again....this will take some time but it will open your safe.

Thats a South Vietnamese 100 Dong note from 1972. The front of the note which isn't shown in your photo is the former presidental palace South Vietnam which was known as the Independence Palace however was renamed the Reunification Palace after North Vietnam won the war. It was the site of the end of the Vietnam War when a tank crashed through its gate in 1975. If in uncirculated condition it would be worth around $4 however yours is probably around 50 cents due to its condition.

WhatsInThisThing,2b4jua,0x100,12,Sat Jul 19 15:54:42 2014 UTC,"Geocaching:       Geocaching /ˈdʒiːoʊˌkæʃɪŋ/ is an outdoor recreational activity, in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called ""geocaches"" or ""caches"", anywhere in the world.  A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook where the geocacher enters the date they found it and signs it with their established code name. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it. Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammunition boxes can also contain items for trading, usually toys or trinkets of little financial value, although sometimes they are sentimental. Geocaching shares many aspects with benchmarking, trigpointing, orienteering, treasure-hunting, letterboxing, and waymarking.

If you do find that some of the coins are this old but you don't want to go through them one by one then you can hold a stack of them and look very closely and you can usually see the coins with much silver content because they will appear brighter than the others. According to my source below, ""90% silver coins are worth about seventeen times their face value.""       Any United States dime, quarter, half dollar or dollar that is dated 1964 or earlier is made of 90% silver. In the dime series, all coins dated 1965 or later are clad coins and contain no silver at all. Quarters dated 1965 or later are all copper-nickel clad coins except for the dual-dated Bicentennial Quarters that were sold by the Mint in special Mint Sets and Proof Sets. These quarters contain 40% fine silver and have an “S” mint mark. They are different from the Bicentennial quarters you can find in circulation and were sold by the Mint at a premium to collectors.      The value of these coins is tied directly to the price of silver. At $25 per ounce, 90% silver coins are worth about seventeen times their face value. A dime would be worth about $1.70, a quarter about $4.25, and a half dollar, about $8.50. At the same silver price of $25, 40% silver half dollars are worth approximately $2.75 each.       http://coinsite.com/us-silver-coins-when-they-ended-and-what-theyre-worth/"

WhatsInThisThing,2b34ej,Yence_,1 point,Sat Jul 19 01:15:22 2014 UTC,"It seems like trying every combination would be a horrible method of cracking a safe.  The exception to this being if someone had access to or built something to do it robotically.  I say this because it occasionally takes me two or three tries to open the combination lock I use at the gym because I slightly mess something up.  It is unlikely that someone can try to open a combination lock 3,422 times without making an error and because they don't know the combination they wouldn't know that they even made the error.  Then again, it is possible that I am of below average ability at opening combination locks. :(  I believe someone on this subreddit once created a robot that cracked combination locks by trying every combination.  The safe that the person used it on was a floor safe which was very similar in appearance to this one.  Maybe OP can contact that individual and ask to borrow it?  It would be a hell of a lot easier than trying every combination themselves.  Also, robots.  Robots are very cool."

I think this was made by Johnson Pacific,  in California.  Not 100% because the handle is just a little different than I'm used too.   If you want to open it without damage, you're going to need to put in a lot of study time. Because contrary to the author/promoter of his book on manipulation,  it is a ""leaned"" skill that takes quite a bit of skill to master.  You can drill it, but I don't think you would have much luck getting through the hardened steel protecting the locking system.  If you really want it opened hire a good safe technician near you.

WhatsInThisThing,2a96z2,waterproofboy,2,Thu Jul 10 05:40:53 2014 UTC,"Ferrous metals are metals like iron, steel, etc.   They oxidize or rust, and magnets will stick to them.  NONferrous metals are metals like stainless steel, copper, nickelcopper, inconel, aluminum, etc that do not oxidize, and that magnets don't stick to.  There are some exceptions with certain alloys but that is the general difference.  You can find out if a metal is ferrous or nonferrous by touching a magnet to it.  This is important because you can't cut nonferrous metals with an oxygen torch.  Torches cut because a jet of oxygen rapidly oxidizes or ""cuts"" the ferrous metal like steel.  Nonferrous metals like aluminum or stainless just melt or spray back at the torch and cause a big mess.  EDIT:  I shouldn't say that nonferrous metals don't oxidize.  They do, but they have sort of a protective oxidized layer on the surface which helps prevent further oxidation.  Steel and iron just rust and keep going until the metal is eaten away."
WhatsInThisThing,2a96z2,6apcyk,1 point,Thu Jul 10 06:09:16 2014 UTC,Would a plasma cutter work?
WhatsInThisThing,2a96z2,Mouler,1 point,Thu Jul 10 06:44:55 2014 UTC,"Possibly.  A plasma cutter relies on a jet of plasma (compressed air being pushed across an electric arc) instead of a jet of oxygen.  Instead of ""oxidizing"" the metal away, the plasma jet is thousands of degrees in temperature.  its basically so hot it can rapidly oxidize just about any material.   plasma can actually cut almost any material, metal or not, depending on the capability of the specific plasma cutter machine you're using.  A major limiting factor with a plasma cutter is thickness.  Not many plasma cutters can cut thicker than 1"" material unless you get a big industrial machine.  It is also not as easy to ""pop a hole"" in a piece of plate as it is with oxyfuel, although it can still be done.  Oxy fuel can cut upwards of 10-12"" thick steel if you're using a high volume torch."

I would get an angle grinder and grind around to edge of the door as much as possible, then weld a lever very securely to the door (so the bar won't brake off) and try turning the door using the bar welded to it. It would be rather easy if the welds are grinded of completely and the fused steel is gone. The holes on the safe frame is probably where a heavy duty hinge was that let the door to swing out but clearly missing so when the door comes completely off make damn sure your feet are below the safe because the door alone probably weighs around 100 lbs. If that doesn't work it probably has bolts like a round bank vault or gun safe, it so it would be a lot hard to get it too.

Should be enough to make the critical bits brittle enough to crush with a 5lb hammer. Just be aware you stand a significant risk of suffocating yourself.  Angle grinder with a cutoff wheel is a decent cheap option. Cut through the welds (seams), not the plates. Keep water on hand just incase. This isn't a very good option if there is a stock cert or something inside.  Alternatively, contact any local locksport group or similar folks with a little experience and offer some cash as a reward ($20, the empy safe, or 10% of any booty inside).

WhatsInThisThing,2a5neo,yong4hu4ming2,1 point,Tue Jul 8 19:47:48 2014 UTC,"Simple looking, yes. In actuality,  the locking system is a strong and redundant element of the door.  The handle should have slight play to prevent binding pressure on the locking system.   The door ""bed plate"", the part under the outer skin, will be at least 4"" solid steel. The entire area around the locking system has an additional ""hard plate"" that strongly resists drilling attack.  Again, best of luck."

I'm going to do my best to describe the locking mechanism for you so you might be able to pick it. It's a really, really simple lock.  It functions like one of these  The only difference is that with those buckles, there's a part on the outside that you push together. For the lock, it's on the inside. Someone else linked to a u-shaped key. Each side of the U pushes together the parts of the release.  You could probably push an awl or shiv down either side of the lock, push the releases together, and then when you pull the locking bar away from the keyhole, it should slide out."
WhatsInThisThing,29w091,Semajal,7,Sat Jul 5 18:38:17 2014 UTC,"I would imagine it is some sort of push to release sprung mechanism. Chances are you just need a piece of metal the shape of that hole and to push it in. At a guess the whole central section will slide away from the side the keyhole is on? It looks like two parts, the part with the keyhole is the outer section, the inner section pushes out or is released to the opposite side of the keyhole. Think this makes sense. Have a look though that hole and see what you can see, if no real mechanism then it pretty much is just mechanical force to push out the other part.

USA pre 1940s. I'm sure it's hard to tell but the older it looks the better chance it's value goes up. 1920s is the beginning of mass production of stamps.

WhatsInThisThing,2975f2,kennerly,1 point,Fri Jun 27 14:37:27 2014 UTC,Stamps that have been well preserved and have a post mark are valuable to certain collectors.  It's basically like the stamp has it's own value plus the value of the unique post mark.  The stamp now has a history of where it was sent and when.  Some collectors like stamps without post marks but there are collectors who ill pay much more for stamps with a post mark.  It just depends on the market and where you sell it.

At the most, he could probably be sitting on $100k, and at the very least maybe $1000.

The pick scrapes along the tumblers (while you supply slight tension with your wrench) pushing them up into the proper position. This is a bit tricky, but the idea is a key ""lifts"" tumblers into the right position, but with slight tension they can stick in place long enough to turn the cylinder without a key.  EDIT: I see how this works... I do my best to help out the OP with detailed instructions based on a grainy photo and I get downvoted."

As a locksmith I can tell you that depending on the quality of the locking mechanism itself, those are generally very easy to pick, or very difficult on high quality, low tolerance ones. The tough part is the tools, most novice lock pick sets don't have the proper tools and won't be able to easily access the levers (which actually look more like rectangular plates with notches cut out) but if you get or make the right tools, it should be pretty fun to open up."

But I can't find the mechanism to turn the bolt at all. At first I though the silver or red walls you see would be a curtain that moved with the bolts, but these are static. I can only assume the tension point is directly behind the silver wall, because the levers flush with the red wall are definitely just levers."
WhatsInThisThing,28o1eg,Intillex,1 point,Sat Jun 21 04:12:18 2014 UTC,"""The keyway in your trunk, spins free because it is likely similar to a simple ""Cheney"" brand cupboard lock. Similar to a projection lock, where the keyway (profile) guides the key in. They usually have ""belly"" type levers inside. They are quite easy to pick, if you understand how.""  This is from lockpicking101.com there's some info there on your type of lock. It's really hard to tell from your pic where the specific parts are, but as a rule of thumb, it tends to be easier to create a makeshift key for those than trying to pick for novices. I don't know your skill level, so sorry if you're more advanced than a novice.   They are very helpful there for newbies, but make sure you tell them exactly how you got the safe, because they WILL NOT give advice if you just say it's a safe and not explain how you came across it, it's against the forum rules.   Do you have s picture of the tools your using. I might be able to give you some tips if I see your equipment."
WhatsInThisThing,28o1eg,Intillex,2,Sat Jun 21 04:38:45 2014 UTC,"I actually came across that site, I saw a post that ""safes belong in the advanced forums"" and on looking into that, I need lots of posts and 90 days membership to access the advanced forums.   I came across that post too, but the keyway is fixed. So no love there. That's why I'm thinking the ""curtain"" (I think thats the name for the sheet that will move the bolts) is right behind the silver wall.   My skill level with other locks, pins and combinations is very good, but this is the first time I've come across or even thought about a lever lock.   The tools I'm using - my kit is solely geared towards pin tumblers. I can use a hook pick to move the levers easily enough, but I'm in the process of making a tension wrench for it. At the moment I'm going for a small wooden skewer with a stiff wire perpendicular at the end (but this is only useful if I can actually find the action).  As to your suggestion of a makeshift key, I'm thinking this will be the way to go. Because I have a picture of a key used in the same lock, and I can see how thick the levers are this might work best.   Never made a makeshift key though! I'm thinking hard plastic carved out. any other suggestions?"
WhatsInThisThing,28o1eg,goatknee,1 point,Sat Jun 21 04:48:01 2014 UTC,"Generally a hard polyurethane, or even sheet metal if you're good with sheers, depending on the amount of tension it requires, you may need to super glue two sheets together. I wish I was there and could fiddle around with it a little and I'd be able to give you much better advice, or even loan you some tools. The Wikipedia article shows a decent internal view of what the tumblers look like, but it sounds like you've got that part down, and the rotation is where you're stuck. I'll try and find some better diagrams, and I'll link you. I had to do a TON if research before I took on my first lock like that."

The lock itself is cheap, even with no experience with these I can tell that. Levers are poorly machined and have friction even without tension. Once I figure out the tension I'm sure it will be a piece of cake.   Though I have to say, I would recommend this box over almost all of the ""safes"" you can buy for under $100 on amazon.

The environment inside a saltwater dwelling fish is so extremely different from that of the human stomach that they pretty much all die before they can cause any problems.   Source: I was in a study abroad program and 6 students ate fresh raw mackerel. The leftovers were put in the fridge. The next day they opened it up and the fish was oozing with parasites. One of the professors pointed out this fact and reluctantly the students decided not to rush to the doctor. They were all fine."

At the time of this murder, he was free on parole following a conviction in Arizona for the murder of a 16-year-old girl.  He was executed in 1983 by the State of Mississippi by gas chamber.  He became the first person to be executed in Mississippi since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated.  Dan Lohwasser, a reporter for United Press International, was one of the observers who witnessed Gray's execution. Lohwasser's account of Gray's death sparked a controversy, because of its violent nature. At the time of Gray's execution, the gas chamber used in Mississippi had a vertical iron bar directly behind the inmate's chair. There was no headrest or strap used to restrain Gray's head. As Gray began breathing in the toxic gas, he started thrashing his head around, striking the iron bar repeatedly before he finally lost consciousness. Officials decided to clear the observation room eight minutes after the gas had been released, because of Gray's injuries.  The decision to clear the room was sharply criticized by Dennis Balske, Gray's attorney. ""Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans (eleven, according to the Associated Press)"".

Its really not all that hard to force the box apart, they were meant to provide evidence of entry to the contents. The area around the combination dial is very strong, so don't even bother trying to drill it. You can't ""scope"" the lock either, because of a special barrier plate, and solid back cover."

WhatsInThisThing,28bl9t,NewEnglandCracker,2,Wed Jun 18 00:37:01 2014 UTC,"It's not necessarily a 302MP. A standard 302 is not that hard to crack. Even if it is the MP model, the manipulation resistant shutter drive does make taking contact points harder but not impossible and the non circular wheels don't exactly make it that much harder to find gates. It's just narrowing the field of numbers you test since once you find a flat side of the wheel, you know the location of all the other flats and you just test those for the gate."

Posted pictures to reddit but isn't in the area until next week?  I'm having trouble coming up with a situation in which all that works out.    Previous tenant of the college rental installed a safe in the wall, then moved out to get a different rental, and left this safe behind?  Owner never noticed the picture this previous tenant left behind because they don't check on the property between tenants?  Who installs a permanent safe in a rental property that isn't theirs?  At some point someone purchased this property, and we're to believe they didn't notice a picture left on the wall could not be taken down, because the previous owner had exactly the same home decorating style as the new owner?  Nobody redecorated, ever, in a rental property?  Nobody ever wanted to hang something else in that spot?  OP, explanations would be nice."

WhatsInThisThing,280xrh,smalltomatoespress,0,Sat Jun 14 00:37:43 2014 UTC,"Well, not so fast maybe.  I rented an apartment in college where the landlord hadn't been in it for something like five years. So long as the rent appeared on time, no one went in, so that was that. My Dad's friend had rented it in the late 70s/early 80s (almost 30 years before I rented it) and it was substantially the same. So the landlord knowing nothing about it checks out with me.  For two, you can rent a place sight unseen in a lot of college towns. Plenty of people will rent a room at the beginning of summer only to turn around and be out of town for a bit.  The room might or might not come furnished -- plenty of landlords, again, don't check their property and sometimes you get whatever furnishings the last folks left.  For three -- I've seen plenty of tenants do pretty weird stuff that was expensive and against their lease.... for no reason I can discern.  So scenario for you: guy rents the room and realizes he needs a safe sport for his whatevervaluableonbject. Maybe he had a gun or two and was HUGE on safety. W/e doesn't matter to us. He goes down and buys a cheap wall safe and installs it. To keep it from being some obvious issue, he covers the safe with a painting.  Say he moves out a year or so later. The landlord goes in, sees the semi-furnished room in a rentable state and rents it out to the next guy. No one takes the painting down.   Now, it's not legal to not paint, but plenty of landlords don't regardless. So this has happened a few times. OP goes in, checks the room quickly, rents it, and then moves in. He notices the ugly painting, tries to take it down, finds the safe just before he leaves to go home and visit his folks.  Nothing all that weird about that story."

I'm usually all for benefit of the doubt, but this is red-flagging pretty hard for me right now.  Though I'll admit, there are possible situations where this could make sense.

Same question, but for actual owner of house, who supposedly was unaware of the safe. Even if the house sold furnished and nobody saw the safe when the house was bought, and it's a rental so the owner didn't live there, I find it hard to believe nobody ever tried to redecorate or even bumped into the picture hard enough to notice it was fixed and not hanging."

I am not sure how much experience you have so I am going to really make it simple.  It starts with 5 left to make sure all the wheels are fully set to that side. Each time you get to the number count 1, 2, 3 etc.  So turn it 5 times counter clockwise to 61. Then go clockwise 3 times to 40. Count the first time you hit 40 as 1 so you will stop the third time you hit it. Then go counter clockwise 2 times to 80.  Now depending on the lock type there is a couple different ways it could open When you start turning clockwise  to 100 try wiggling the left side handle back and forth while turning. If it is a direct entry fence it should eventually turn and allow you to open the lock. You might have to keep turning past 100 if it is not a direct entry fence.  Go slow and steady, dont rapidly spin or twist the dial as it can throw things out of alignment and cause you to start over."

WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,RemindMeBot,1 point,Mon Jun 16 23:33:54 2014 UTC,"Well when you get a safe lock they usually suggest starting on 0 just for habit. It gets you into the process of always turning the dial after locking and turning it to the same place so somebody cant just turn the dial to the last number and open the safe.  The reason that your safe does not have 0-19 is because that is known as the ""forbidden zone"". Due to the way safe locks work you cant use that area for the last number of the combination as the safe lock will not work right so they just left those numbers off but you lose out on total possible combinations that way. Here is a picture of an old vault lock I have. You can see they have the space but have the full 0-100 so you can have the full million possible combinations. http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/Riyame/Sargent%20Greenleaf%20and%20Military%20locks/SG%20safe%20lock/001SampGSafeLock_zps8df0f69c.jpg  I found this video that shows the dialing sequence. The first rotations for you lock could be only 4 but they probably put 5 just to be safe I think. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEYjgOFKR1U"

WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,Bdtry,2,Wed Jun 11 17:53:15 2014 UTC,I just followed these instructions and no luck but I have a question on the turn to 80.  Do I pass it once and the second time it comes up stop or pass it twice and stop the third time it comes up?
WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,Knightmare,2,Wed Jun 11 20:11:23 2014 UTC,"The safe in my mother's basement looks like this one. I can try to help based on that. The second time you hit 80 is 2...so once past and then stop on it.  Additionally, for her safe you need to turn the dial to the last number and then rotate the dial counter to that last rotation to open. So if the last instruction was right to 100, you follow that by turning the dial left as much as you can. That is the last piece to opening the mechanism. Just turn until you hear clicks. The dial is actually the knob to open, the thing to the left of the dial is a handle.  Often I don't get my mother's safe open on the first try so keep at it and make sure to count your dial rotations."
WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,Bdtry,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:31:04 2014 UTC,"The Start at 20 thing throws me off.  Google search for (safe combination ""start at 20"") turns up almost nothing.  That seems very odd.  There should be an opening sequence to reset all the wheels. If the 5 left to 61 is the resetting of wheels, where you start shouldn't matter."
WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,nightshiftb,1 point,Wed Jun 11 21:31:15 2014 UTC,"The start at 20 is basic dialing instructions. You put the dial on the lowest number and start the dialing from that point. It helps to keeps things simple. So ""Turn dial to 0/20. Turn R/L X times to number X"" and so on. Some people get confused if they dont have a starting point to start dialing from."
WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,Bdtry,1 point,Thu Jun 12 02:05:57 2014 UTC,"try turning it left, landing on 61 the 5th time you hit it. turn right, landing on 40 the 3rd time you hit it turn left, landing on 80 the 2nd time you hit it turn right until 100 and try opening, if it doesn't open, keep turning until the dial stops."

WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,ANAL_ANARCHY,1 point,Thu Jun 12 06:08:51 2014 UTC,A normal safe lock works that way but others are called direct entry. These ones you stop on a certain number and turn the handle to open them.

At my old job, there was a safe, it was pretty much the exact same except for the paint job. No one knew what was in it because no one there had ever opened it. We would always look for clues as to the combo to it. We never found one. One day, my friend who worked with me was sitting on top of it. He had his feet propped up on the twisty handle part. I guess it was the weight of his legs, but it started creaking open slowly. We were transfixed and more than a little confused. I grasped the handle and pulled hard, I guess it was rusted shut or something. Layer on, we showed everyone else that we opened it. They asked us for the combo, but we said it was a lucky guess and that we didn't remember it. We were hailed as heroes though. Anyway, the point of the story is that you should really try to give it a mighty tug. The safe in my story was so heavy that it took over 250 pounds of weight to open it."

WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,agromarcy,4,Wed Jun 11 15:40:07 2014 UTC,"I think that Bdtry gave you the proper instructions, but I'd like to clarify a bit if I may.    1) Turn the knob at least 4 times all the way around counter clockwise and land on 61. 2) Locate the number 40 on the dial. 3) Slowly turn the knob clockwise until the 3rd time you get to the number 40.  Stop right there. 4) Locate the number 80. 5) Slowly turn the knob counter clockwise until you get to the number 80 twice (as in, stop on it the second time it comes up). 6) Turn the knob clockwise to 100 and stop there. 7) Crank the handle to open the bolts and swing the door open."
WhatsInThisThing,27v2du,Bdtry,3,Wed Jun 11 19:51:43 2014 UTC,"Also keep in mind it could be seized shut. I posted a similar one here a year or so ago, I had the key, but it wouldn't open.   If you hit that, my method was basically soak the hinges in WD40 over night, then the next day wiggle-wiggle-wiggle, apply more WD40, once you get a bit of play in the door, wedge something in the crack (a thin flat head screw driver) keep applying pressure and more WD40.   Don't try and pry with the screwdriver, it will snap, you are only using it to wedge the door and save the progress so you can keep the pressure up."

In addition in 1960, the Soviets had around 1600 nuclear weapons, and the ICBM was still pretty much experimental. Nuclear weapons would have to be flown to the USA by bombers that had to survive the formidable American air defense system.  I think in a small town in the Midwest in 1960, it'd have been quite reasonable to assume that if there was a nuclear war, you'd not be directly targeted, and once the fallout had died down, you'd be able to come up and restart things again."

WhatsInThisThing,27nxfj,Kantastic,25,Mon Jun 9 15:11:23 2014 UTC,"A lot of answers, few addressing your question specifically- but the pistol safe idea is a good one.  This box is a piece of crap, but it's $20, and the six pack you offer a good friend to bolt it to the slab in a corner of your closet will cost you only a few more dollars. (Drilling through the bottom of the box will void the fire integrity of the container, but you're mainly concerned with theft.)  Now, that's what we call Security Through Obscurity: if your brother finds it, he can lever it open with a crowbar in seconds. Its theft resistance is nearly nil. It's the location that counts. Another security through obscurity one is the can safe. You could keep your pills in one of those or a book safe, and stow it somewhere they won't think to search.  This with a bolt-down kit will come in well under $300, and be a bit more of a pain-in-the-ass for bubba when it comes to stealing your goods- it's still a toy safe, and he can still break into it with a bit of determination and mess. Plus, you'll owe your friend two six packs of beer instead of one for the molly bolts and rocking it into the slab.  My recommendation would be to stop by a local safe and vault place, lay out your budget and see what their recommendations are- even if it's nothing more than a box with a Medeco high-security lock that you can bolt down into the slab or something like that. My recommendation would be to stay away from anything with biometrics, digital locks, etc. as they simply don't have the reliability of all-mechanical locking devices like keys and combination locks, except for the really high-end stuff which most people won't pay for."

WhatsInThisThing,27nxfj,onyxblack,8,Mon Jun 9 17:03:46 2014 UTC,Well if you can flex just a tiny bit on $300 I bought this for about $350 during a really good sale. If you have the patience to wait for a great deal they are an awesome safe. Not sure if it's the size/weight you were needing. Its 355 lbs and about 5 foot tall or something like that.  http://www.libertysafe.com/buy-a-safe-explorer-12-color-pg-84.html  Slightly smaller but extremely similar safe by same ppl. Slightly less expensive.  http://www.libertysafe.com/buy-a-safe-revolution-12-color-pg-71.html  Here's a smaller one by Barska. Looks sturdy. Biometric lock.   http://www.amazon.com/Liberty-Door-Panel-Accessory-Ammunition/dp/B004YW7PB2/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1402326149&sr=1-1&keywords=liberty+centurion  And smaller....  http://www.amazon.com/Barska-AX11650-BARSKA-Large-Biometric/dp/B005MVF6HO/ref=pd_sim_sg_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1Q53YE0841GCX7YKVJTN  And smaller....  http://www.amazon.com/Barska-AX11224-BARSKA-Biometric-Safe/dp/B002AQ0PFW/ref=pd_sim_sg_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1Q53YE0841GCX7YKVJTN  Last three are all $250 or under. Last one is $169. Biometric locks on all the Barska ones. The Liberty has a triple hardplate rotational lock (not sure what to call the ones you turn).  If you prefer smaller they have a line of home safes. Even the smallest is quoted as slightly more expensive than my big ass gun safe but I am guessing its because of the biometric lock and probably a much better fire rating to protect documents. But like I said...you could probably get it for half the price with patience and some looking around.  http://www.libertysafe.com/safe-home-safes-safes-ps-11.html  edit: I'll PM you my favorite hiding places.

I used to hide my money in the vacuum cleaner bag, and I used to keep my weed in spice jars in the cupboard- he had no use for ""basil"" or ""marjoram""."

I'm not sure if you can get a good safe for under $300. Any safe you do get if it's small, and it will have to be for that money, some one is just going to carry away unless the safe itself is secured, either bolted, or welded or set in concrete.   Check craigslist or ebay, things like that, might be some one has a safe they just want to get red off if you move it you can probably get one for free. Spend the $300 dollars on a locksmith fitting and/or opening replacing the dials."

There is a faded no. 25538 on top, and a patent number 883005 underneath.

WhatsInThisThing,2711r0,AaronChapmanDev,10,Sun Jun 1 21:05:05 2014 UTC,"Ok, I'll tell you as long as you promise this is your safe..... As a side note, because you have both keys, I'll trust that you are the owner.  The fastest way , with the least amount of damage to the safe is the following:  ~Drill a 3/8"" hole just to the left of the combination dial, in line with the center of the keylock. Have the edge of the hole touching the silver dial ring. Angle the drill slightly inward towards the dial. This is made of very thin sheet metal,  and fire block, easy to drill through. You will go about 1 inch before passing into an air space...stop drilling now.  ~Take a flashlight and look into the hole. You should see a flat steel bar to the left side, and three round wheels to the right. The wheels will have small notches cut into them all around the circumstance. You will see that one notch on each of the wheels is cut deeper than the others.  You will need to line up those deeper notches, with the flat bar to the left. Once done, you can turn the key to retract the locking bolt. have fun."

As far as value, sorry but there's little demand for these, making the value around $100 ~ $200. Yours has been drilled open and not correctly repaired, along with being painted that lovely color.

It looks like there is a little space there.  Then slowly push that latch into the door.  You may need to carefully move it 1mm at a time, or you may be able to get it all in one go.  If you have time to spare, it is worth a try.  Likewise, if you have something like a credit card, you can try using it like a screwdriver to loosen the screws in the hinges or anywhere else you can find screws.  Sometimes you can unscrew the outer plate behind the doorknob (against the door) and get it loose enough to disassemble the doorknob.  I think you should plan on replacing the doorknob when this is over no matter how you get out.  It would cost $20 or so to do that.  With that in mind, since you are going to throw it out anyhow, lets whack the doorknob sideways with something until it breaks off, then reach in the hole and pull out all the pieces until you can get the latch out of the jam.   You probably won't damage the door very much if you break off the doorknob."

WhatsInThisThing,26xu8q,Rebootkid,11,Sat May 31 06:38:38 2014 UTC,There are only some many ways out of a room and you've precluded every single one. I think you need to choose one way out or stay locked in until someone saves you.
WhatsInThisThing,26xu8q,Ar72,3,Sat May 31 06:40:23 2014 UTC,"The idea is to remove the pin (metal rod holding the two bits of hinge together) rather than the screws.  You need a strong thin thing, such as a metal rod and a heavy thing. A short (1-2cm or so) length of coathanger wire, a screw, or a nail may be strong enough. You sit it up against the bottom of the pin and give it a bash to force the pin upwards. Once you get it started you may be able to use leverage or strength to pull it up."
WhatsInThisThing,26xu8q,Year3030,3,Sat May 31 06:45:00 2014 UTC,Hinge pins should be accessible from the inside even if the screws aren't.

WhatsInThisThing,26nf1b,joboo62,1 point,Wed May 28 02:00:25 2014 UTC,That is usually because the locks are made from hardened steel. You should go with my suggestion and call a locksmith.

There's likely another key locked compartment inside which can be opened by a locksmith. 6. The inside is likely very pretty with hand painted striping and wood inlay. Good luck."

My guess is that the lock is either a Mosler or Yale and if it's a Yale, it could be a friction fence lock. Either way, it can still be manipulated open! There's a book on how. There's also a shorter, but free version on keypicking. If you have any questions, the people on that site are very helpful too! Good luck, I hope you get it open without damage :)"

WhatsInThisThing,25z6j6,r3vOG,8,Fri Jun 6 15:01:57 2014 UTC,the safe itself is the prize here!
WhatsInThisThing,25z6j6,remove,6,Mon May 19 22:59:21 2014 UTC,"60 dial. I think it's a two number combo.   This safe uses a direct drive with no relocker. There are no false gates on the two wheels. The drive is on the back of the wheelpack. You can open this safe with manipulation. Check out this animation of how a drive picks up the wheels. http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/security/combination-lock.htm  Notice in the animation how the drive can spin around without moving the wheels, that is because there are rings in the wheel that have a little notch on them that interact with a notch on the driver. You should be able to spin your dial two times, in either direction, before it picks up both wheels(wheels turning). We will call this ""picking up the wheels"".   When you spin the dial carefully, you will notice it spins easily. If you could spin the dial all the way around and monitor the exact moment you feel resistance, you would know when you pick up the first wheel. If you would continue spinning(with the first wheel picked up), you would feel slight resistance as you picked up the second wheel(second wheel turning). Now, you have both wheels spinning as you spin the dial. They will continue to spin until you change direction. This is important because you need to be able to identify when you are turning wheels, and more importantly, where the gates are located on the wheels. The gates are the slots cut into the wheels to allow the fence to enter when the bolts are retracted.  The simple summary is this: Turn the wheel at least three times to the left so you know you have picked up both wheels. Apply right(cw) turning on pressure on the handle. Slowly dial left while applying pressure to the handle. It will bind and grind. There should be two spots where you notice either movement in the handle, or a different kind of grinding/binding. Note those numbers/areas of the dial. One of those is likely your first number. This is because the drop in is zero, and your safe's driver does not have a nose to pull the bolt back. There are two wheels with no false gates(cuts or slots) and a direct drive tailpiece. IDK the dialing sequence, so that is what is stopping me from giving further instruction. DL Matt Blaze's paper Safecracking for the computer scientist if you seriously want to try and manipulate it open. It is far from a guarantee, but the safe is antique and not used for security. Even if you mess it up, it still has value as a decorative piece. Not much, but it is neat.  edit: spelling and second number is not zero"

See if you have holes for boltwork both on the top door jam and on the hinge side of the door. These are actually fairly common in Europe and South America. They are great locks and extremely hard to pick. Basically when used to their full potential they will not only throw the 4 deadbolts you see in the picture but an additionally one at the top, bottom and other side of the door, locking it on every edge. Nearly impossible to kick in."

Pretty sure a pin is broken. I was able to pull it out with a pair of nail scissors.  Putting it back just recreates the problem of not being able to seat the key deep enough to turn it.

WhatsInThisThing,25h5of,LockManipulator,2,Tue May 13 21:20:30 2014 UTC,"The key lock is out of proper position.   File the little tip on the outer edge of your bypass key back all the way to the body of the key.  Basically removing the tip in full. Now insert the key and turn to unlock the safe. This should solve your issue. However if it doesn't,  find a hammer, or rubber mallet,  and strike the top of the safe very near the front edge in the middle. At the EXACT same time the hammer strikes, turn the safe boltwork handle to open. Timing is everything on this maneuver...it may take several attempts to get it open. Best of luck, and happy travels."
WhatsInThisThing,25h5of,themadhatter1015,2,Wed May 14 02:08:01 2014 UTC,Thanks for the tips:) Will try and let you know. Will the striking method break the safe mechanism? Or is it pretty much screwed anyway by the state of the lock?
WhatsInThisThing,25gwwa,Prosopagnosiape,2,Tue May 13 18:35:49 2014 UTC,"I can't be certain because I really don't know locks all that well, but it looks like a very simple mechanism, where a key with a hollow cylindrical shaft slots in and when you rotate it, it hits a spring loaded catch.  If that's the case, you may be able to use a paperclip to find and push that catch. It's likely to be at the top of the lock (above the pin) so try inserting a paperclip from either side, point it upwards and feeling for a small plate that a key could catch on. Then give it a push. If it won't give, try from the otherside. If the paperclip is not strong enough try a bobby pin.  If the lock is even slightly more complicated than that (and it probably is) then I'm afraid I can't help you."

WhatsInThisThing,256wp5,AbleToFail,3,Sat May 10 16:39:18 2014 UTC,"yeah, you're going to have to do something pretty serious - it's the same here in Canada, generally you're just going to get a ticket, unless you're up to something malicious. the only ticket I've ever received technically under a trespassing charge - I was in an unlit park after 10pm. despite the fact there was no signage indicating it was off-limits, and it had a walking/bike trail leading over to another part of the city.  didn't have to pay it though. they wrote my name down completely incorrectly. sometimes it pays to have a less common spelling of a name. it trips people up. (which is usually annoying, but not in that case)"
WhatsInThisThing,256wp5,MissedHerPink,1 point,Sat May 10 16:47:31 2014 UTC,"That seems very unfair, especially as I'd imagine it's the landowner's responsibility to legibly state if trespassing is or is not 'allowed' there... Though Canada has always seemed to me like a place where the law is quite fair,  especially regarding low-level matters such as that. Would you say that's a fair statement? Because it's actually part of the reason that attracts me to the country, and it is somewhere that I have been considering living in for a while now.  I don't know if you've lived in the UK, but the police here have a fair bit of the horrible condition - powertripitus - which sadly not only affects themselves but has the shockwave effect of hitting anybody unfortunate enough to come into contact with them."
WhatsInThisThing,256wp5,Integraholic,3,Sat May 10 16:59:37 2014 UTC,"you'll find that anywhere sadly... but I will say that the majority of my interactions with the police have been very positive. one of my favourites was years ago when a friend of mine had been kicked out of a place he was living and the people who lived there refused to give his belongings back.  we agreed to show up with the police to help move his stuff, they went up and talked to the people living there, told them that they needed to let him get his stuff back within something like 48 hours or they'd come back and break in the door at their expense. we didn't move anything that day but they agreed to let him get his stuff (this was nearing the end of a long drama regarding said belongings)  so we (my friends and I) were standing outside across the street waiting for a bus and one of the cops who came had been driving a paddy wagon. he asked us where we were going, we said downtown, he offered us a ride so he loaded us into the back and gave us a ride almost all the way home. even joked with us when letting us out ""you want the whole experience? maybe some pepper spray and billy club?""  we were only about 19 or 20 at the time, usually the age people butt heads with police the most, so that always stuck with me."

On the Gregorian calender that is 1868. So theoretically 146 years old. BUT, what the tax history shows could mean two separate things: 1. that the storehouse was built in that year, or 2. that the storehouse, in that year, was registered with the state for tax purposes.

WhatsInThisThing,24xs82,Learnincurve,1 point,Thu May 8 19:14:41 2014 UTC,I can tell you from experience that cracking a safe is not as fun as you ever thought it might be. I had to sit in a tiny room while I watched a pro crack a safe open. It took 16 hours of drilling a hole and hammering away at the lever. To be fair the safe had to be opened without destroying it or arming the re locker. But it definitely was not exciting.
WhatsInThisThing,24xs82,INomYou,2,Fri May 9 09:57:47 2014 UTC,"What are you talking about??  I know for a fact that it takes about 13 minutes to open a safe. Any safe.  You drill one hole. Then you bang the hole precisely with a hammer. You hear a click. Then, you say ""The customer always opens the safe."" Then you almost open it. Then you go to commercial. When you return, you again ""The customer always opens the safe."" He opens it. Profit. On the way back, you discuss your next knuckle tattoos."
WhatsInThisThing,24xs82,Faggatron9001,1 point,Fri May 9 14:14:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, except the safe that was being drilled was a massive safe with 6 inch walls full of money. It had concrete and a tungsten mesh in the wall and the safe guy had to keep sharpening his drill bit. So given that in my experience at least one safe was not able to be opened in less than hours, you claim if ""every"" seems a but far fetched. Just made me think that if you were to break into a place with such a safe for the money, breaking into it would be less glamorous than you see in media."

They would have used an auto dialler but they only had two and they were both in use. Luckily we had a duplicate safe next to it that we could open so he could see the locking mechanism and location of relocker tension cables. He was able to precisely measure the location and angle for the drill and set up the drilling frame so he could insert the bar and hit the locking arm. He then ended up hammering in an old drill bit to seal the hole.  When things were happening it was interesting, but the longest part was the drilling."

They never made too many of them as they have difficulty recognizing the patterns that keys use and for some bizarre reason they don't work with colored keys at all. It does have a highly acute sense of sound detection that can be used to unlock it though. If you take a small speaker playing a 60hz tone at a comfortable but audible level, you should be able to move the internal locking mechanism to the unlocked position in about 10 minutes. You would need to place it in what would be the lower right hand corner (according to the image on the right) of the safe door. It should be noted that the amount of rust spots you identify on the safe will affect the length of time required to open it."

Except for a particular Mosler lock , and a LaGard lock, the clicks you are speaking of are the two contact points on the drive wheel. You may also feel and hear when each of the combination wheels pick up the next wheel in the pack. Neather of these two events, will provide information on the combination numbers.   It will indicate how many wheels are in the lock, and it will also give a very well trained and skilled safecracker,  a clue to the model of the lock in use.  That all being said, several years ago,  at a safe and vault convention,  a select few of us were shown a very kool device.  It was still in the testing stage, but when property attached and calibrated,  it could open a locked mechanical combination in just a few minutes.  It used both sensitive microphones attached to the safe, and a crazy ability to ""feel"" the dial. This device has never been shown again, as far as I know. I recently had the chance to chat with an old friend who knows such things. The device is now perfected, and in use by one of our security agencies.   I hope this helps out."
WhatsInThisThing,24zbfh,NewEnglandCracker,2,Thu May 8 00:04:02 2014 UTC,"Dont forget that the Chubb Manifoil lock is also very ""clicky"". Indirect drive safe and vault locks as well as antique safe locks that use a gear on the dial to move the wheels can often make lots of noise that lesser knowledgeable people might mistake for ""manipulation"" noises.  Was this the manipulation device you were referring to? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_U5OlfXyY It probably uses load on the servo motor to determine where the contact points are. Once it drops into the zone it finds out where the load increases to start going up the ramp and then assigns it a value."

I rang up my buddy at that agency to ask about it, and was told that the current design will open a three wheel Sargent & Greenleaf 6730 lock installed on a 1 inch plate door in 3 minutes or less. When installed on a thicker, less dense door, such as a composite one, it can take upto 8 minutes. Much more than this, is as he said, beyond my pay grade."

WhatsInThisThing,24vbf2,stirfriedpenguin,7,Tue May 6 18:57:49 2014 UTC,"That is a lever lock. Still used somewhat in the UK but my understanding is that they are not very common at all in the states, so if you are in the states and you do eventually get a locksmith make sure they know that because it may be the case that they don't actually have the tools or expertise to open a lever lock.   You could try picking it with bicycle spokes or a clothes hangar. I've had some luck with those in the past but only on very simple lever locks up to 3 levers with no curtain. If the safe is very old it may be that the lock is fairly simple so I'd say it's worth a shot. Will require some study time though.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cero7vrqm6s  Edit: Also, removing the metal plate won't make it easier to pick, may as well leave it on."

WhatsInThisThing,24vbf2,bbpgrs,8,Tue May 6 15:30:23 2014 UTC,"Just a quick note for the OP- Some safes use gravity as part of their unlocking scheme (mine included).  This means that even if you had the key, you might not be able to open the door unless it was standing upright at the time.    So make sure it's upright when you're picking the lock.  It's possible that's the position it's in in your pictures, but it's worth a quick once-over to ensure that you've got it right side up.  Part of me thinks that hinges should be vertically aligned."

The ""box"" was actually a large jar (πίθος pithos)  given to Pandora (Πανδώρα, ""all-gifted"", ""all-giving""),  which contained all the evils of the world.  Today the phrase ""to open Pandora's box"" means to perform an action that may seem small or innocent, but that turns out to have severely detrimental and far-reaching consequences.  The similarities of the story to the forbidden fruit in the story of Adam and Eve were identified by early Christians such as Tertullian, Origen and Gregory of Nazianzus.

WhatsInThisThing,24ec1q,Slave_to_Logic,5,Wed Apr 30 20:34:43 2014 UTC,That fireproofing plaster might have asbestos in it.  You might want to have it tested.
WhatsInThisThing,24ec1q,Scratchy_McBitesalot,1 point,Thu May 1 20:12:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you may be right.  And I should have wetted it down as a precaution.  Oh well, that wouldn't have been the first time I was exposed to asbestos.  Luckily it seems that only the folks who worked with it everyday ended up with problems.    But I do doubt that this was an asbestos-filled safe.  I have never heard of asbestos being poured into a mold as a liquid like this material was.  And there was only powder, no visible fibers.      A quick internet search shows that HHM did use asbestos on some of their doors and grout on the others.  The asbestos is stated to have either been applied as ""¾ inch asbestos board insulation"" and they also used ""asbestos sheet insulation.""   But I'm fairly certain that this was just the grout type as I didn't find anything but material that was poured in place.    Either way, I'm going to replace it with a nice fresh batch of gypsum.  :)"
WhatsInThisThing,24ec1q,Friiy,2,Thu May 1 20:29:51 2014 UTC,"When I first got the safe, I described it a bit in this thread.    But since then I've come to really understand the safe.  Herring Hall Marvin made these safes all through the first half of the last century.  This one was sold to a company called the ""Blue Valley Creamery Company"" which was in business from 1900 to 1939.  This safe clearly must date to that period, although I am unable to narrow it down further.    Since it was locked open, there was no reason to break it in any way, per say.  But just removing the combination piece and setting a new combination wasn't going to give me the satisfaction I craved.  So I took the door off and removed all of the cement (or plaster of paris or whatever it was).    Below that plaster layer you can see the locking mechanism in its entirety.  I thought it was fascinating and I thought I'd post the pictures here just it was interesting to someone else too.    For the record, I have reattached the door and the safe is working perfectly.  However, I have not yet poured new plaster into the inside of the door.  So it is not currently as fire proof as it was.  But one nice Saturday I hope to buy some plaster and re-do the insulation on the door.  It looks like it will be fairly simple.    So go ahead and AMA!"
WhatsInThisThing,24ec1q,Friiy,2,Wed Apr 30 20:42:28 2014 UTC,you got the combo changed? Good Job!  The brass wheelpack is absolutely beautiful! Are you sure there isn't supposed to be a cover for the back of the door? Usually you don't see the fireproofing.
WhatsInThisThing,24ec1q,Gordopolis,1 point,Thu May 1 13:56:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, there is a cover on the back of the door.  I think you can see it all together in the third picture in the linked album.      But the brass plate covering the locking mechanism is only held on with 3 screws and the metal backing to the door it only held on with 6 screws.  It's a 1 minute job to remove them.  It's a one hour job to chisel out all the fireproofing though!"

This style of container has a very poor combination lock, and it is very easy to pick off the combination."

So I live some ways from home because I'm a uni student. I come home with my gf and I notice there's dust everywhere, I open the room with the safe, and safe is gone. All excited I ask my mom where the safe is, she says my stepdad opened it. Combinations worked ( got from the company), but door was stuck. It took 4 hours to saw it open because the safe was actually somehow bolted closed from the inside. I asked what was inside and well, I won't be able to post the contents on this subreddit, and will not be able to actually tell people what was found. Sorry to disappoint you guys! Thank you for everyone who tried to help, your information was extremely valuable."

I figured no big deal, I'll pull the panel on the inside of the door and reset the combo to something I know. Well it rained on the way back home and it was in the bed of my truck. Get home, haul it inside and start to dry it off with a towel and the towel runs across the dial and resets it with the door closed. DAMN!  I call the lock smith the next day and they say anywhere from $400 - $600 to pull the dial, drill a hole under it to see the wheel pack and unlock it, reset the combo to something I know, fill the hole, re-install the dial. Screw that! I didn't pay that much for it. But being curious I looked up ""safe cracking"" online and found some resources on ""lock manipulation"" got even more curious. Found a site called keypicking.com that I joined and found a bunch of materials either written or accumulated by guys over there. Studied their materials spent 6 or so hours over a few days manipulating that lock an TADA! Got that sucker unlocked. Given the same style combo lock I could probably now duplicate the effort in an hour or two. It was an S&G 6300 series lock, one of the most common.  Anyway. That story probably doesn't solve your problem right away but it all depends on how badly you want to see inside it.   TLDR: Bought a safe, locked it without knowing the combo, learned how to crack it, got it open."

Some desks are designed that the side drawers ""unlock"" when the top is rolled all the way up.  Other roll top desks need the center drawer pulled out half way to open the side drawers but that desk doesn't appear to have a center drawer.  Edit: After a closer look at the side drawers they, look like they have key holes so it doesn't appear there are any special locking mechanisms built into the desk."

WhatsInThisThing,23gotz,OyleSlyck,2,Sun Apr 20 18:17:55 2014 UTC,"Dunno. Assuming the locks on the drawers are the same as the lock for the roll top, looking at how the roll top would lock might give you some clues as to how the locks for the drawers are set up. Also I imagine that looking at the keyhole style of the desk and how all the locks would need to be opened using the same key, the locks for the drawers might be like a mortise lock with a simple deadbolt that get unlocked with a skeleton style key.  http://iamtonyang.com/0911/mortise_lock_body.jpg  On the right side hand of the body mechanism, you can see it's just a bolt that slides in and out. On that bolt is a notch where the tooth or bit of a skeleton key could bump against as it was turning to slide the bolt in or out, depending on the direction you are turning the key.  This is all just speculation on my part, though."

WhatsInThisThing,237e56,tadjack,4,Thu Apr 17 05:07:32 2014 UTC,you can probably pop it open with a crowbar.
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,swiftkilla77,3,Wed Apr 16 21:36:49 2014 UTC,If you don't mind damaging it. You can take the plastic of where the key lock is. Then use a hammer and screw driver and knock the lock through to the back out of the hole. You then can lift up a bar that was connected to the back of the barrel opening the safe.. Obviously this is a last resort tactic but I have opened 2 digital safes that had a tubular lock in the middle this way.... But this is a risky tactic... Good luck! Also you could just buy a tubular lock pick cheap enough on line :)
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,Bdtry,0,Wed Apr 16 21:06:24 2014 UTC,Or you do it wrong and fire any relockers it has and then have to resort to calling a locksmith (which should be done) or having to cut it open and likely damage the contents.
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,FruitbatNT,3,Wed Apr 16 23:36:41 2014 UTC,$300 safe with the same mechanism (likely) as a $40 safe?  Probably not glass plates or relockers to worry about.
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,Bdtry,1 point,Thu Apr 17 02:38:19 2014 UTC,Never know. There could be a flange on the lock case to hold a spring powered relocker. Punch out the lock and the relocker fires.
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,cybergibbons,1 point,Thu Apr 17 05:16:59 2014 UTC,I've never seen a safe with a tubular lock have any form of relocker on it. Also not mentioned in specs or required for this security level. Massively unlikely.

If not phone a locksmith and tell them that you are needing to get into a gun ""cabinet"" (NOT a safe) and that it has a X style over ride lock.  If you say the word safe it will get very expensive very fast. If you say cabinet with an over ride lock they will know it is a cheaper model and they can pick the lock easily and cheaply. It should be just the house call fee and probably $50 at most to get it open.  Dont let some fly by night scammer tell you that is a high grade safe and has to be drilled."

WhatsInThisThing,237e56,matthewfive,1 point,Thu Apr 17 15:50:11 2014 UTC,I posted a link below with the coverage of the story by a regional journal if you don't believe me.
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,matthewfive,3,Thu Apr 17 15:57:30 2014 UTC,"Can the guns be given to a firearms dealer, and then re-purchased for a fee that makes it worth the dealer's while to do the necessary paperwork?"
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,matthewfive,5,Wed Apr 16 23:15:31 2014 UTC,"No re-purchase is necessary for a family transfer like this, but lately some states have made certain cosmetic features illegal, so Grandpa's old rifle that he got in the 1960s might have been declared an illegal assault rifle while it sat in that safe.  It's convoluted, and limited to a handful of rather ill-informed states, but if OP is in one of those states  a standard-issue police sidearm magazine may have been declared an illegal 'high capacity magazine' over the past year or two.    Heck, grandpa might have had an old WWII trophy machinegun from Germany that he brought home from the war (as was legal) that, if not registered in 1986, would now be a 10-years-in-prison crime to possess and could never be registered.  A war widow turned one of those in to the police a year or so back to be destroyed, and they refused because it's the sort of thing that belongs in a museum, but she could just as easily have been arrested."
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,DanGarion,3,Thu Apr 17 00:13:11 2014 UTC,"KY, though I am from NC.  Are you familiar with KY laws regarding this?  OP would like to deliver if possible."
WhatsInThisThing,237e56,drumstyx,3,Thu Apr 17 00:17:42 2014 UTC,"NC has some goofy handgun transfer laws, but if the safe is already moved to Kentucky before you open it you can ignore that as there's no way to transfer something you don't know about or have access to, and no reason to risk the trouble of bringing a handgun back just to be transferred.  No other restrictions there.  Kentucky has essentially no laws you'd need to worry about.    If you find a machine gun, don't post it.  I'd love if you did, but don't.  Old machineguns fall into 2 categories:  legal ones registered in 1968, and illegal ones that weren't registered.   An illegal one should be transferred to a museum through your lawyer; don't risk talking to police directly.  A legal one is going to be worth a whole stinking lot of money and you should keep that on the down low to avoid theft or whatever.  You can't know if a machinegun is legal without going through your lawyer and having him look up the gun via the ATF without identifying you (Attorney-Client privilege).   The odds of a machinegun being in there are very small, but that's the only legal hurdle you have to worry about it so I give you everything I know.  More likely, there will be a handful of nice shotguns, hunting rifles, maybe a pistol or two, and some cool old ammo.   I'll buy any old ammo boxes in there off you if there are any, even if they're empty - I collect that sort of thing.  Hopefully it's not empty!  Go shooting the firearms at least once, even if you intend to sell them.  It's fun and you can connect with your grandfather."

The police generally try to stay within their legal/constitutional bounds as the DA advises the police on best practices. But the police arrest based on probable cause. The standard of proof in a court can be anywhere from more likely than not to beyond a reasonable doubt, all of which are higher standards than probable cause. The DA basically looks at evidence after an arrest and determines if prosecution has a high probability of success or if it will be a waste of limited prosecutorial resources and taxpayer money. The police will gather the evidence and the district attorney will apply the law to the evidence taking into consideration what the judge will think of the evidence, and whether a jury will believe the evidence if the judge allows it to be admitted.   So they work together and if they both do their jobs perfectly then the arrests and prosecutions would be equal, but this isn't minority report or dredd and nobody is perfect so there will be discrepancies between arrests and prosecutions."

WhatsInThisThing,22xc86,Bel_Marmaduk,15,Sun Apr 13 19:05:56 2014 UTC,Any circumstance still makes sense.   Being detained - don't talk until you have consulted legal counsel. Not being detained - don't fucking incriminate yourself and get detained as I outlined before.    You have no obligation to talk until you get subpoenaed by a court.   Obviously it doesn't fucking mean you can't ask a cop how his day has been and make small talk. It's only in situations where he's doing his job as a police officer and interrogating people.

His basic premise is that there is no reason to talk to the police, and that doing so can never improve your circumstances.

Lots of minority communities feel this way because simply being black in the vicinity of a crime can lead to a lot of hassle if not actual incarceration. This doesn't as a general rule make them super approving of police officers.  Legal scholars feel this way because they have studied many thousands of cases, many of which were fairly executed, and some of which people self incriminated or were wrongly accused of a crime.   Their basic premise is that helping the police in the pursuit of a criminal may implicate yourself even if you do not think you are guilty of anything, if that's a potential risk then why risk it?  As i've said elsewhere though I would not hesitate to call the police if i was the victim of a crime.

We didn't hand it over because the only people we saw working there were high school age and we knew exactly what would happen to that money. So we brought it home and cue my panic attack that it was a bad idea to take the money. I thought it might be illegal, it might have been the restaurants, it might have been a drug drop and someone followed us home and we were about to be murdered. So despite my girlfriend's irritation with my sudden development of a conscience  at me I turned it in the next day to the police. And wound up on the news for a ""feel good"" story. The police informed no one in the history of the department has ever turned in that much money. Which made me feel even shittier about it. After speaking to a friend who's husband is in charge of the evidence department I was contacted by the department and told that if no one claimed it in 90 days, it was all mine. Guess what? No one did. :)  TL;DR I found a couple grand, turned it it, and 90 days later got it back."

There's an old story- probably apocryphal- about a double cannonball safe with a time lock to it, storing a big chunk of money for a remote logging site. One payday Friday, the combo wouldn't work even after the time lock had timed out.  So, they make frantic phone calls, and this is decades after the safe was made- and there's nobody in Idaho or Bumblefuck or wherever this container is, but they manage to get some old retired safe tech on the line, and he says to hit it with a mallet about this hard at that location on the front of the safe. That'll get the sticky part in the time lock mechanism to drop into place, allowing the container to open. He has them repeat back the instructions, and hangs up.  Sure enough, it works, and the loggers get their payday and spend 80% of their money on loose women and booze, and waste the rest.  I have a similar story (also probably apocryphal) about a diesel train engineer who diagnoses a mechanical issue over the phone back in the day of rotary telephones, in which they have to run an extra-long line from an office out into the rail yard and hold the phone up to the train so he can hear it and properly diagnose it."

Some have time locks on the back, so once you're done for the day, it's not opening until the clock winds down AND you dial in the correct combination.  The door is round because it rotates around.

WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,mewfahsah,2,Sun Apr 6 04:11:02 2014 UTC,"Actually, they would have to wind them to set them. Time lock movements are graduated in hours.

Come 8 am the next day the movements would tick to 0 and activate something that would move allowing the safe lock to open.

WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,teknokracy,6,Sat Apr 5 16:58:45 2014 UTC,nothing you can't buff out.
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,UMKcentersnare,4,Sat Apr 5 18:39:42 2014 UTC,"I personally have never experienced any negative effects. But the possibility is there esp. when mixing with other greases and oils. And it might peel paint, as it is a petroleum product. But they all are. One thing you might do is mask off areas around the lock with blue painters tape. Also, make sure the area is well ventilated, maybe use a fan. This goes for anything that involves paints and solvents though.  Really, I do not see any alternatives. I really doubt a locksmith would have anything better (hey locksmith's chime in!). And taking a torch to the safe would obviously create an infinite amount of damage. You can drill the safe (or have it done) which also will create a certain amount of damage. But if someone drills the safe, they still need the mechanism to work. This also would be expensive (likely).  Really, a torch might be the cheapest way to go to get inside. Outside of a torch, and getting the dials to turn again, PB blaster really is your best hope at unsticking the mechanism - in my armchair opinion.  I believe that was an earlier discussion that some of these early safes are relatively easy to crack. It may even not be the first of its kind on reddit. So you have that going for you."

Locksmiths don't have access to drill points for all safes, especially not older ones. Something like this was a custom build, for it's time. If they can't find someone who worked on this, they're guessing. Knowing the manufacturer of the lock will help, but not much. This is not getting opened without damage, and extensive repair. Minimum one hole for each dial, two or three more to free up the gear that crank rotates to operate the interlocking lugs in the door. Open and repair/restore is going to cost a minimum of $7K, all labour."

WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,sanguinor,2,Sat Apr 5 18:39:46 2014 UTC,could you explain timers to me?
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,s0crates82,2,Sat Apr 5 07:15:33 2014 UTC,"Inside these safes are some timers, you can set them to only allow the safe to be opened during a specific time frame. When fully wound, they timers last about week before running down and locking the safe. I believe there is a manufacturer override combo for each specific safe, but good luck finding it. These safes are some of the hardest to get into."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,s0crates82,1 point,Sat Apr 5 14:08:00 2014 UTC,"Actually on a safe that old it should be a 72 or (less likely) 120 hour time lock.   Most were of the kind that you wind for X hours at closing time and it will prevent the safe from being opened until the movements ran down. When the movements ran down to 0 they would move a bar that would move another piece which would allow the safe lock to open. The exact methods varied by time lock.  This means that even if it is run down it should be open. The ""over ride combo"" that you speak of only applies to combination ""time and combo lock"" units since the dials arent attached to a standard time lock.  Here is a picture of a time lock that actually came from a cannonball safe. http://imgur.com/MUwcRJ2 It is a bit blurry but you can see the timers are all run down and have pushed the bars over allowing the safe to be opened."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,warboy,2,Sat Apr 5 12:47:26 2014 UTC,Why wouldn't the timers have ran down by now?
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,thisrockismyboone,2,Sat Apr 5 15:47:55 2014 UTC,"i think they mean the timers are optional.  basically if the timers were set, and run down.. freeing the mechanisim may not help.  best bet is to find a reallllly good locksmith who wont drill.  wow.. good luck on this one."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,Gandar54,2,Sat Apr 5 16:14:09 2014 UTC,"Yes, and that's the problem.  The mechanism is disabled (cannot be opened, even with the combo/key) by default.  When the timer is running, it enables the mechanism at a certain time of day.  When the timer runs down, it's always disabled."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,warboy,1 point,Thu Apr 10 12:49:35 2014 UTC,So how does the timer get turned back on?

It acts as a lubricant in the short term, but it's actually mostly a solvent that will dissolve any oils protecting the mechanism.  Never put WD40 on a bicycle chain, unless you like your bicycle chains to rust solid. Any kind of oil would work better, even vegetable oil. (But you're better off buying bicycle chain oil.)"

I worked for years in a bike shop, I know my shit. Any mechanic worthy of the trade will tell you not to use WD40 on a bike chain."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,Wonder1and,5,Sat Apr 5 10:27:45 2014 UTC,"I don't have a stake in this game.  I do think it's interesting that the company directly refutes your assertion:    WD-40 and Bikes    Myth: WD-40 Multi-Use Product should not be used on bike chains.    Fact:  While WD-40 Multi-Use Product it is not a grease, it is    formulated with strong lubricating oils and other ingredients,    and is a terrific product to use for bike maintenance. It does    not attract dirt or moisture to metal surfaces – just be sure to    wipe off any excess WD-40 Multi-Use Product before riding.    For long-term lubrication and other specialized bicycle    maintenance needs, check out WD-40® BIKE. Developed specifically    for cyclists and mechanics, this high-performance line of bicycle care    products is sure to become a mainstay in the toolboxes of bike    mechanics for decades.   I also think it's weird that after saying it's fine to use on bike chains, assuming you wipe off excess, they've got something that's specifically designed for bikes - which either was marketed because it's actually better for bicycling purposes, or was released due to bike shops instructing people not to use it for this purpose.  Personally, I prefer wax-based chain products on my (motor)bike.  If wax-based isn't handy, multi-use teflon'll do.  There are guys that use WD-40 on their motorcycle chains exclusively, and swear by it."
WhatsInThisThing,2298u1,Swellzombie,5,Sat Apr 5 15:24:40 2014 UTC,Of course they do. I'm sure 80% of WD-40's sales are from stupid people who buy it thinking its a lubricant while not understanding the term degreaser.

WhatsInThisThing,21skb5,mackk,2,Fri Apr 18 23:46:38 2014 UTC,"You might be riding up on the contact points. Are you graphing them? Try approaching the contact points very lightly, light enough to let the contact point stop the dial. Or just use one finger to gently turn the dial until it touches the contact point. Graphing really helps too; in this scenario the difference might only be 1/8 of an increment so try to find a gate signature that varies by 1/8 on your graph. If this doesn't work, try AWR. Some locks won't respond well to AWL. You can also just park wheels 1 & 2 in the forbidden zone (contact area) and just graph wheel 3. Then wheel 2, then wheel 1 if nothing shows up still. Are you reading the free version or the paid one? The free one doesn't include a lot of tips the full version has but if you don't want to pay for it, I can still answer your questions :)  Don't worry!

WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,Obeeeee,8,Sun Mar 30 02:25:12 2014 UTC,This is the answer right here. ~$20 and you're in.
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,cybergibbons,12,Sun Mar 30 14:18:25 2014 UTC,"Do you care about preserving the safe?  If not, grind that fucker apart.  If so, contact the manufacturer."
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,brewer521,6,Sun Mar 30 01:47:46 2014 UTC,Some sentry safes don't allow you to change the combination. You may be able to contact sentry and provide them with the serial number to obtain its original comb from factory. Sometimes these safes also have a very simple lock and with light pressure on the handle you may be able to feel the gaps in the wheels to dial it. Mark down the numbers that you feel and try different sequences of the numbers. Good luck!
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,123SMYD,5,Sun Mar 30 02:05:09 2014 UTC,"can you be more clear. Sometimes when i spin the dial, it clicks. how would I even spin it? I remember my locker in high school you needed to spin 2 times left, then once right, then straight left. Whats the process for this one"
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,PresidentCoolCat,10,Sun Mar 30 02:08:42 2014 UTC,"Listen, you aren't going to hack the combo, but sentry is pretty good about their combos.  Get the SN of the safe, take a photo, get a notarized letter that says you ownt he safe, where its located and that you've owned the house x years.  Send that to sentry, you'll get a combo in a few weeks."
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,XxGrave,2,Sun Mar 30 03:20:41 2014 UTC,The combination lock on most Sentry Safes is a big pile of crap. It's so grindy and noisy that even someone who is used to manipulating combination locks is likely to struggle.  Either get the combination from Sentry or cut it open.
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,Dfd1223,2,Sun Mar 30 07:28:09 2014 UTC,90% of the time it's 4 left 3 right 2 left. Then right to zero again. But if it's a direct dial to handle safe then you don't go back to zero and one less rotation per number. Don't listen to people saying you won't be able to guess the numbers. You might not be able to... but it's fun to try and if you get it you'll feel like a champ. I'm a locksmith and cracked a safe this way last month. Being able to gloat over my doubting co-workers was the best part.
WhatsInThisThing,21pqiy,vORP,1 point,Sun Mar 30 23:04:21 2014 UTC,"Ex-locksmith here.  The clicking is probably another wheel in the wheelpack getting picked up. It's no big deal.  It is possible to get into some of these containers with a bit of trial-and-error. Get a long piece of wire, and attach it to the handle. Tape a piece of paper to the front of the safe where the end of the wire is. You want to gauge how far the handle turns, using the deflection of the wire. Turn the dial to the left 3+ full revolutions. Put light pressure on the handle, and put a mark on the paper. As you turn the dial through 360 degrees, you may need to lift the handle in order to allow the dial to turn. Write down the numbers where the deflection of the wire on the handle is the greatest.  Once you've found those spots, turn the dial 3+ times to the left, and stop at one of those numbers- preferably one that deflects the most, although there may not be one that stands out. Now start turning to the right, and map it out the same way. Once through 360 degrees, stop and rotate the dial 3+ times to the left. Now re-enter the first number, and select a second number- one of the low spots from the second, if there is one. There may not be. Repeat for the third digit, starting by turning left. Map out the regions of greatest deflection. The container may open if you find one this third time around. If not, try permutations of the numbers you have found on the mappings you have done.  Or, if you'd like to save yourself a few hours, a reciprocating saw or even a circular saw with the right blade can be used to tear these cheap-ass safes apart. There's no guarantee the ""mapping"" will work, but I've done it before on Sentry containers similar to this model. Their combination ""lock"" is a piece of crap, and the container itself is not meant to withstand any sort of serious attack."

I found a PDF for the lock, and it was no help. I'm sort of still at square one. Realizing this was a half decent lock made me not want to take a hammer/drill to it, incase it has resale value. My final goal has always been to fit a wooden coronation lock I made to it, so destroyIng the lock is an option, if nothing else.  Edit:punctuation"
WhatsInThisThing,21mka7,cybergibbons,2,Mon Mar 31 04:32:23 2014 UTC,"It's an S&G electronic lock:  http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/prod_elect.php  I don't know which specific model, but it is a good lock. Most of them have a ""Management Reset Code"" which is meant to be kept somewhere safe in case all the user codes are forgotten. But if the safe company says it will cost a couple of hundred to get in, it sounds like you don't have this.  The brains of the lock are inside the safe, connected by a small cable through the spindle hole in the safe door. It's just a keypad, buzzer and LED on the outside.  The options you really have are:   Drill a small hole to ""spike"" the lock . Spiking is when you connect voltage directly to the actuator inside the safe, bypassing all of the control electronics. This safe will probably have a lot of hard plate (very, very hard steel) around the lock, making this hard to do. The design of the S&G locks makes this very hard. Drill the lock to retract the bolt - a bit more destructive, you drill a hole to enable you to manually retract the bolt.   Both of these need time, equipment and skill. A safe engineer is the best bet.  This isn't a Sentry Safe, so you can't power the actuator from outside the door, you can't get the code from the manufacturer, you can press the code reset button from outside, you can't trivially pry it open.  Don't touch the hinges. They hold the door on when it is open."
WhatsInThisThing,21mka7,Ev_antics,2,Sun Mar 30 07:53:18 2014 UTC,"have you searched on line for the user manual?  I have a safe that uses a thumbprint, code, and key.  If the batteries die and you change them, there is a way to reset it"
WhatsInThisThing,21mka7,cybergibbons,3,Sat Mar 29 04:29:57 2014 UTC,Why would there be a way to reset the combo from outside the safe?
WhatsInThisThing,21i3pr,TMR_Defender,96,Thu Mar 27 13:26:28 2014 UTC,"4 turns means STOP ON the 4th time. Only pass it 3 times.  If dialing the combo like that doesn't work, try this:   I'm guessing it's a mosler MR 302-402(really good lock). Does the dial spin smoothly all the way around? A standard lock should have 2 very faint points of resistance. A higher grade mosler you'll hear some extra noise.   If the dial is smooth and has no extra sounds or resistance, then you can easily crack it! That means you!

WhatsInThisThing,21i3pr,figuren9ne,50,Thu Mar 27 20:14:44 2014 UTC,"Oh my gosh...so much miss information, where to start ?  First: the key is used as a dual custody feature.  It simply locks the dial from turning. If you can rotate the dial, it is unlocked and no key is needed.  Second: How to properly dial in the combination.   Turn the dial left (counter clockwise) stopping the fourth time 35 comes to the index on the dial ring (white line). Turn the dial right (clockwise) stopping the third time 77 comes to the index. Turn the dial left stopping the second time 60 comes to the index. Turn the dial right, the dial should come to a dead stop. It may be around the number 85. If the numbers are correct, the lock is now open.  The slight resistance,  clicks, are part of the security features of this lock. They prevent the ""feeling"" of the drop in point of the fence.   If this didn't work, these locks are well known to slip the combination slightly.  Try the same dialing sequence above, but alter the numbers by 1/2 a number. (Example,  77 1/2 for the first number). Do this for all three numbers. Not open yet? Add a whole digit to the numbers (78) no ? Subtract 1/2 a digit from each number. No ? Subtract a whole digit.  If none of this works out, call a professional safe technician.  Be sure to ask the people you call if they are safe technicians, not just locksmiths. There really is a difference between the two. Google = SAVTA for someone in your area. Hope this works out for you, good luck."

Yes you need both the key and combo it even says it clearly on the label, HOWEVER: i think on this model the key lock only locks the combo dial from spinning,, if you can turn the dial it means the last person to open the safe didn't lock the key lock like instructed on the top plaque or the key lock doesn't lock the combo dial still(unmovable) but rather disconnects the internal tumbler mechanism from the dial... in which case a professional locksmith is your next telephone call..  if when you turn the dial you can feel that the whole dial is moving and the dial is connected then all you need to do is reset the dial... this is usually done by spinning the dial clockwise a few times.... say 5 full turns and then stop on ""0"" from there start the combination (4 turns left to 35, 3 turns right to 77, 2 turns left to 60 then 1 turn right until the dial stops) if it doesn't stop within the 1 full turn to the right (you make it all the way around back to 60 then you either screwed up the dialing or the key lock is locked and the combo tumbler is disconnected internally  hope this helps."

I have hammered pegs into asphalt and gravel driveways on cattle farms, and I have hammered into grass that has had soil as difficult to penetrate as those surfaces.

WhatsInThisThing,21ghck,crazyticklefight,2,Thu Mar 27 01:02:30 2014 UTC,You could layout the yard in a grid so you can isolate the highest and lowest points in the yard. These would be areas of leftover soil taking the space of the box that the cash is buried in. Could narrow down a few locations without doing anything more than staking and running lines.
WhatsInThisThing,21ghck,Zoot_Katz,1 point,Thu Mar 27 05:56:39 2014 UTC,"Wait, how would they actually work?"
WhatsInThisThing,21ghck,Elitist_Plebeian,5,Thu Mar 27 01:44:40 2014 UTC,"I was thinking of setting a grid to find the highest point, then setting the string height of the entire grid to the highest point. It would give you a visual interpretation of high points and valleys, and would also show you if the soil settled further over time, like what would happen if you had a decaying wooden box or even a rotting tree root.   In my opinion, at the first stretch of nice weather he has in his region, I would do the grid then flag the areas of interest. Take down the grid and leave the flags in the yard. Whenever the mood strikes, work on one of the flags over the summer. Gives an example for progress.  Or you could simply rent a backhoe and rip the whole 50x50 yard up in an afternoon."
WhatsInThisThing,21ghck,UnckyMcF-bomb,2,Thu Mar 27 13:26:52 2014 UTC,Mark off your back yard in a grid and get to digging.
WhatsInThisThing,21ghck,Zoot_Katz,2,Thu Mar 27 00:18:43 2014 UTC,"I'm going to recommend not posting any videos of your digging to youtube (if you find anything or not), until you check with a lawyer.   It would suck to find $10k in cash or something, and then have the previous owner sue you for it, and then have the city come after you for breaking some obscure anti-digging ordinance.   Make sure there's no possible ramifications before posting ANY videos.   Good luck, and happy hunting."

WhatsInThisThing,21gxai,dkdavid721,4,Thu Mar 27 01:59:52 2014 UTC,Feel for a gap along side the wheels and then turn them all at the same time. Like this
WhatsInThisThing,21gxai,aza9999,2,Thu Mar 27 03:32:10 2014 UTC,"Put pressure on the button while you turn the right most wheel. One particular number you should feel the button ""give"" a tiny bit. If not, try the left most dial.  Repeat with the other two dials.  This works with most cheap dial combo locks such as bike chains etc"
WhatsInThisThing,21gxai,Dynamiklol,2,Thu Mar 27 06:41:08 2014 UTC,"Yes! If you shine a light to the right (could be left but try both) of each wheel as you slowly spin it, you should be able to see a notch at one of the numbers. You have to closely look inside. It's very hard to see but easy once you get the hang of it. You're looking for something that looks like a rod going through each wheel horizontally. Let's say on the left side of each wheel there's a notch at 6-2-9. 6-2-9 is not the combo. Now spin each wheel down 1 to 7-3-0 and try that. Keep going. It'll probably be 5 numbers away from the ones you find originally."

Maybe something is caught on it and needs a little more force to pop the latching mechanism open when it is on the correct combination.

WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,spankr,26,Wed Mar 19 02:13:31 2014 UTC,"you could try brute forcing all of the combinations. If you don't have time you could get a thin piece of metal and slide it along the side of the wheels to feel for an opening. It's hard to explain in words so watch this:  http://youtu.be/HULuem6udOA?t=1m12s  If those 2 methods don't work, the locking mechanism is probably broken and you'll have to pry the lock off somehow and replace it. Good luck and let us know if you get it open :)"
WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,dkdavid721,12,Tue Mar 18 20:16:04 2014 UTC,"this guy has possibly the most helpful idea so far, you don't have to watch that video for long to see it could totally work. the ""gate"" might be on the other side of the wheels, which would make it not as useful.  definitely worth a shot though."
WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,kickaguard,6,Wed Mar 19 00:18:25 2014 UTC,"the gate has to be attached to the wheel for the lock to work. Once you  find both gates, rotate both dials 1 click each until it opens. You basically cut the possible combinations down to 10."
WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,dkdavid721,1 point,Wed Mar 19 04:43:00 2014 UTC,could the gate be on the other side of the brass enclosure? that's what i meant about it being less useful.
WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,kickaguard,2,Thu Mar 20 23:05:53 2014 UTC,"The way these type of rotating wheel locks work is there are number wheels that the user turns and attached to them are smaller metal wheels that you don't see. These metal wheels are solid all the way around except for 1 position where there is an opening or ""gate."" the way you open the lock is you rotate the number wheels so that the gates on the corresponding metal wheels line up with a pawl attached to the locking mechanism. If all the gates are lined up the pawl has room to move into the gates when the square latch is pulled. When the gates aren't lined up the pawl is blocked by the metal discs and the lock won't open. So that means there is an inherent design flaw where if you slip a thin piece of metal along side of the number wheels, you can feel the metal wheels inside the lock. Then just turn the number wheel until you feel your metal shim fit further in and you've found the gate for that wheel. Repeat for all wheels and you've found the gates. Then just move all the number wheels 1 position at a time, trying the latch each time. By already knowing that the gates are lined up there can only be 10 possible positions no matter how many number wheels there are. Whether the gate is on the top of the number wheel or the bottom, I don't know but all you have to do is try both top and bottom to find out. Hope this explanation helps :)   Edit for spelling."
WhatsInThisThing,20ptgd,dkdavid721,0,Fri Mar 21 09:17:33 2014 UTC,"This.  Just go through the combinations while watching TV or a movie.  It only would take a few seconds to move the dial and try the latch, so going through 99 combinations would not take too long...it's just mindless..."
