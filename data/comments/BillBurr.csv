From his recent podcast I'm calling it right now, his 5 pounds lost are the pissed out water weight after he stopped eating all that salty food, and booze. Hes gonna get all down on himself next weeks podcast for not losing 5 pounds every week. Keep with it Bill ya fat cunt you can do it! although 3 pounds a week is a little aggressive, 1 pounds more realistic."
BillBurr,3dp2c0,YouArePostSucks,5,Sat Jul 18 05:39:23 2015 UTC,I've already lost weight and gained it back. After you lose it you realize how easy it is to stay motivated once you're getting results. Its just getting it started that's that hard part cause your addicted to the lifestyle. It's all about getting over that first hump and holding yourself accountable.

BillBurr,3dp2c0,plymouthvoyager,2,Sat Jul 18 15:57:05 2015 UTC,There ya go! It's awesome how the MM podcast is literally just him telling you what he has been up to. He is brutally honest and he's just like all of us trying to be the best person he can be.
BillBurr,3dp2c0,LucarioPrime,3,Sun Jul 19 14:07:57 2015 UTC,Every time I reach an escalator next to a flight of stairs I (in my head) brutally fat shame myself and imagine Bill doing the same to me. I haven't used an escalator in the past 4 months as a result.
BillBurr,3dp2c0,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:31:36 2015 UTC,I lost 70 pounds so far this year and I owe a lot of it to Bill's fat shaming lol. I'm sidelined with a knee injury but good look  to everyone.

BillBurr,3do2h6,mnick56,4,Fri Jul 17 21:45:38 2015 UTC,I read the description after the video. Apparently this was a tribute show of sorts where the comics could go up and mimic their favorite comedian.  The guy in the video is Nick Vatterott. His CD is For Amusement Only and it is honestly one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time. I recommend it.
BillBurr,3do2h6,viewless25,6,Fri Jul 17 21:48:10 2015 UTC,That was hilarious. Lol 45 seconds to go

BillBurr,3do2h6,Weirdfellas,2,Sat Jul 18 09:08:39 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I saw a Nigerian guy do a Chris Rock tribute act at a comedy club in Lancashire, England. It was bizarre. He literally just did a 20 minute bit of Chris Rock's material. It was a great impersonation, but it made me feel weird. I think he called himself Chris Crock or something. He sat next to me after his slot and read a book."
BillBurr,3do2h6,PapaGator,2,Sun Jul 19 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"That was fuckin great. I can do Bill's laugh perfectly, but that's it. I love when comics can do other comics.   After not knowing where to put my hands the entire first year I've done stand up, I stole the ""Billy lean on the mic stand"" pose in homage. (It's actually helped me quite a bit)"

Michael and Bill still love working on and watching movies but Michael doesn't fck with comic book movies (even though he'd be in one). Since Michael has done so many movies Bill wants to know if Michael knows if a movie is going to be bad when he gets to set.

BillBurr,3dfrp6,cyclenaut,4,Thu Jul 16 14:10:43 2015 UTC,UH UH UH WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE DOES THIS SEND TO THE CHILDREN
BillBurr,3dfrp6,Renarudo,8,Thu Jul 16 23:26:33 2015 UTC,I MET A LAADDDDYYYYYYY
BillBurr,3dfrp6,subatomicB,14,Thu Jul 16 15:06:29 2015 UTC,Seeing that rant in text made me laugh my ass off.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,Darce_Choke,8,Thu Jul 16 06:38:16 2015 UTC,Seeing the text of Bill calling Mendes Barney Rubble made me laugh my ass off all over again.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,HongManChoi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:06 2015 UTC,I found it even funnier than listening to it. Just the censored words made it seem worse for some reason
BillBurr,3dfrp6,ngisyenoM,6,Thu Jul 16 16:25:11 2015 UTC,Ohhh Jeeeezus
BillBurr,3dfrp6,Misterdejesus,7,Thu Jul 16 04:02:35 2015 UTC,old billy headliner overTHEEeeee^ RE
BillBurr,3dfrp6,Sciene,15,Thu Jul 16 16:34:37 2015 UTC,Bill always complains about some blogger taking his words out of context. This is the first time I've ever actually seen that happening. I I don't seek them out or anything though.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,yourkindhere,18,Thu Jul 16 00:57:29 2015 UTC,They printed the whole rant. This one actually does contain the context. I guess if you only read the title it's out of context.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,GritznGravy23,7,Thu Jul 16 04:03:20 2015 UTC,I thought the article was favoring Billy boy. What do I know though.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,LtCthulhu,5,Thu Jul 16 06:12:02 2015 UTC,MMA media has been getting ridiculous. Joe Rogan was talking how his podcast has been quoted like it was news. He said the news was coming as the podcast was running.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,notimeforname,2,Thu Jul 16 06:39:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think it paints Bill in a bad light at all.  I just find it funny that an MMA news site is even reporting on this in the first place.  It's not like there's nothing else to report on right now.  There are four fucking UFC events this week alone.  I think they're just looking for any reason to put McGregor's name in the headline since he's hot shit right now."
BillBurr,3dfrp6,HongManChoi,3,Thu Jul 16 16:40:23 2015 UTC,Me undies just sold a few more pairs. No moe schweaty clam

BillBurr,3dfrp6,SamShit_DifferentDay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:41 2015 UTC,Nope just showed up on my Google now
BillBurr,3dfrp6,viewless25,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:23:46 2015 UTC,Holy shit Connor McGregor's facial hair comes out exactly like mine. I guess its just an Irish thing.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,dictatereality,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:38:01 2015 UTC,Bill Burr might actually have to apologize for once if McGregor gets upset about it.  And if that happens it'll be a hilarious bit in his next special.
BillBurr,3dfrp6,dictatereality,3,Thu Jul 16 14:17:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll have to apologize. It's his podcast and I doubt sponsors will care. Mainly I doubt McGregor would show himself to be such a huge puss as to make any noise about this. If anything, it helps him since being a cunt is his whole schtick."
BillBurr,3dfrp6,DULLKENT,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:32 2015 UTC,What I said wasn't meant to be taken literal.  Of course he wouldn't apologize.

BillBurr,3dbbd3,tonothegreat,6,Wed Jul 15 02:41:57 2015 UTC,Mostly small/liberal college campuses

BillBurr,3dbbd3,MrWinks,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:02 2015 UTC,That video IS reddit
BillBurr,3dbbd3,gman343,4,Wed Jul 15 05:22:55 2015 UTC,"Blown out of proportion to show how rediculous people can be. It's like tosh said, ""I'm sorry, I came to to a comedy club, I sure hope there's jokes and sarcasm"""
BillBurr,3dbbd3,Jesus390,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:37:37 2015 UTC,Its an exaggeration for sure but shit is like that on the internet at the least.

BillBurr,3d9sob,DevTech,4,Wed Jul 15 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"He signed them all by hand at the Boston show I went to, so those posters definitely didn't have sigs just printed on to them. I'm sure he's doing the same with the ones he's shipping out. His signature is just ""B.B."" so I'm sure he can bang them out pretty fast."
BillBurr,3d9sob,aselectionofcheeses,3,Tue Jul 14 17:56:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I remember correctly he said in one of the latest podcasts that he brought them home to sign them all, so I guess they are all signed by hand and not photocopied."
BillBurr,3d9sob,NochaSc2,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"In one of his ad readings for stamps, he said he uses their service to ship out all the posters he's trying to get rid of. Naturally he'd sign them all if he just has them lying around his place."
BillBurr,3d9sob,intensive_porpoises,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:09 2015 UTC,Yep he signs all of them with a sharpie. The Boston poster is well detailed
BillBurr,3d9sob,pcslinger,0,Tue Jul 14 20:02:19 2015 UTC,What the fuck do you think he's selling over there. Obviously he signed the thing

Her opponent has 75% win by decision with like 0 takedowns. Does the lady from Brazil not even do BJJ or something? weird? I think this is going to be really one sided. Unless Correia is like the best standup takedown defender ever.
BillBurr,3d55x5,djn808,6,Mon Jul 13 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"The only reason they're even fighting is because Correia talked a bunch of shit, beat a couple of Ronda's friends, and the fact that they're basically out of challengers for Ronda at this point.  It's going to be a slaughter."

It is fascinating to me that people are willing to do that, some people are genuinely hilarious and talented, and it's interesting to see the heights of fame they can reach from it. It has never made me want to do it or change anything about myself, but I have been trying to stop watching. I hate seeing kids involved and families broken up, and the recent aftermath of certain shows is giving me pause to keep watching. Maybe I'll give that up instead of booze, lol.  But no one can say Kris Jenner and Kim don't know how to hustle. I may hate the product and not like them as people, but their business skills can't be denied."

BillBurr,3d2wz7,craigliterate,2,Mon Jul 13 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"There were several episodes in 2010-2011 where he talked about being out of town because he was filming episodes of Glee. He teased that shit for ages (NDAs and confidentiality etc) before finally revealing that he had in fact been cast in Breaking Bad.  I do recall that once the cat was out of the bag he talked about how big a fan he was of the show from day one and how amazing it was to hang with the cast and crew on set. IIRC he did provide a few details about how he was cast - someone in the BB circle had seen his standup etc.  Apologies for lack of more specific detail or ep dates, but right now it's all I got and I figured it's better than nothing. Old skool /r/billburr subbers - I still haven't found my show notes!"

You can look up his interviews on YouTube, some of them are definitely titled something like ""Bill Burr on his Breaking Bad gig"". Sorry, can't remember certain podcast dates or shows he was interviewed on.  However, I remember a funny story when he talked about how they were shooting the famous scene with Walter White having a complete breakdown while lying in the basement of his house, when he was crying/laughing hysterically. Bill was on the set that day and saw the whole thing happening. Bill said that he was completely blown away by Bryan Cranston's acting (duh!), but the thing that amazed him was that right after that Cranston approached him and was like: ""Hey, so I know you do stand-up, you're really good!"". And Bill thought to himself: ""Get the FUCK outta here! How can you be that good?! What the fuck was that, did he just switch that shit in a second?""."

BillBurr,3cwgiv,corizmo,13,Sat Jul 11 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"If you are interested Bill wrote a blog back between 2006-2009.  He didn't make very many entries but he does talk about his growth as a comedian.  Here's a link  and here is a quote:   Basically, I was 23 years old, mentally about 11, had zero self-esteem, and I didn't possess any sort of mental filter. At that point in my life, anything someone told me, I believed. If someone said I was good. I thought I was good. If someone said I sucked. I thought I sucked. I had no ability to shake anything off, so the last thing I wanted to do was irritate people and bring negative attention that would feel like shotgun blasts to my thin-skinned comedy torso. And I certainly didn't want to offend anyone in the crowd, because I didn't possess the skills to be able to handle them if they turned on me.  Early on, I had my entire act memorized. Every night I did the exact same jokes, in the exact same order. Yet I would still make a set list before going on stage, because I was so afraid that I was going to forget what I wanted to talk about. If that wasn't psychotic enough, I had another Rain Man compulsion. When the MC was about to bring me up, I would quickly untie and then re-tie my sneakers. I was deathly afraid that they were going to somehow come undone and then I would trip on my way up to the stage and be completely humiliated.   Pretty interesting read.  The one I quoted is titled ""Chinese Democracy"""
BillBurr,3cwgiv,Yoko042684,4,Sat Jul 11 16:14:10 2015 UTC,Damn that's amazing to think he started like that and goes on to be one of the best. I just think he was so committed to his dream that he was gonna do anything to achieve it.
BillBurr,3cwgiv,Hazlem,5,Sun Jul 12 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"This is really somewhat strange to me. Even though Bill wasn't a loser when he was a teenager/early 20s, he sounds a lot like I am, where he has no filter, had no self-esteem, was introverted (I remember him talking about talking to himself on his paper route as a kid and saying how stupid he was) and was just like the class clown type. I've even had people tell me I should be a stand-up comedian, and my style of humor would be exactly like that of Bill on his podcast where he just gets so furious over the smallest things. I've even been compared to Bill Burr. He has said things on his podcast that he does that I thought I was literally the only person who did it or said it (I don't remember specifics, but it has happened a handful of times where I say WAIT BILL THINKS THAT TOO?)  He was able to turn his life around he it gives me hope that maybe I can too even though I am so much worse off that him starting that it isn't even funny"

I saw Paul Virzi at a grocery store yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, I also said that I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him too much and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” while closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away in disbelief and continued with my shopping.....I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Kit-Kat chocolate bars in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very polite and professional about it. “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” he then turned around and winked at me. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

BillBurr,3cqumf,diaper_fetish,9,Fri Jul 10 08:09:49 2015 UTC,"Ol' Billy Redface is right. Just because her movie is coming out, doesn't mean the people who get offended by everything have a right to cherry pick what offends them."
BillBurr,3cqumf,Taydolf_Switler22,14,Sat Jul 11 00:42:38 2015 UTC,She just recently got in trouble? Holy fuck cmon. I'm Hispanic and I thought that joke hilarious.
BillBurr,3cqumf,blue_magoo_62,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, im missing the joke. Can you help? Is it that she forces herself on hispanic guys or that hispanics force themselves on her? Urgh. I suck. Thanks"

BillBurr,3cqumf,121isblind,14,Fri Jul 10 15:14:56 2015 UTC,Bill is absolutely right on this.  Comedy is a performance. The podcast is less of a performance but it still is one. Amy even alludes to it being so in her apology. Why doesn't Brian Cranston apologize for being a drug kingpin murderer? Why is that so different? Unbelievable.
BillBurr,3cqumf,destroyermaker,6,Fri Jul 10 02:14:43 2015 UTC,That's a great joke. Her apologizing makes me ill.
BillBurr,3cqumf,angeleyedchaos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:05:29 2015 UTC,"Jesus, this joke was told TWO YEARS AGO and (even as a Latina) that joke was short, sweet and hilarious.     ""While black families are burying their dead, churches are burning, black women church pastors are receiving death threats and the KKK is planning rallies in South Carolina, Schumer is 'playing' with race,"" said Patton and Leonard. ""While Latinos are being deported in record numbers, while '80 percent of Central American girls and women crossing Mexico en route to the United States are raped,' while children are languishing in camps in the Southwest, Schumer has got jokes, and only white America is laughing.""   Oh, come on! They're making it seem like she's the only one to have ever told a joke involving race. There is no need for this kind of severity.  I'm not even a fan of hers or care for her very much, but this is a bit too harsh."

BillBurr,3c7tyw,psychedelicsexfunk,8,Mon Jul 6 04:20:40 2015 UTC,the 'sleep sex' two parter has to be an all-time classic for the podcast. if i remember correctly someone brought up the concept one week and the next some guy tried to add supporting personal evidence about some times with his girlfriend. it was insanely hilarious and featured bill making zombie sounds. the horror inflected in bill's voice as he read the email (along with his attempts at playing it down with humor) make it possibly the funniest moment i've ever heard on the show.  it is an absolute must listen for fans of the podcast.

BillBurr,3c1aov,knotswag,-6,Fri Jul 3 23:12:10 2015 UTC,But you do understand they're reporting that for a reason yes? They're reporting what people want to hear.

BillBurr,3byuhr,FUCKBOY_JIHAD,2,Fri Jul 3 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"I think he refers to a general belief that the fast food giants and makers of unhealthy foods have lobbyists in Congress who block legislation that would limit their food's exposure to children, etc. in favour of healthier food options. Plus we shouldn't be surprised if we found out there's some unnamed or unknown chemical in some foods that make it so addicting we keep eating/buying more of it.  This as well: According to the United States Federal Trade Commission, food and beverage companies (44 companies reporting to the FTC) in the U.S. spent approximately $1.6 billion in 2006 to promote their products and services to children. In the United States the Federal Trade Commission studied the issue of advertising to children in the 1970s but decided against regulation. For contrast, in Quebec, Sweden and Norway advertising to children under the age of 12 is illegal."

BillBurr,3bqrx3,Krazy8s,9,Wed Jul 1 11:51:20 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I think Lewis is a better choice. Anger and outrage is what defines Lewis Black's onstage persona. Bill is hilarious when he's angry, but he rarely gets apoplectic like Lewis Black, who is like that basically all the time (standup, Daily Show's Back in Black, etc.)"
BillBurr,3bqrx3,zoologia,3,Wed Jul 1 14:16:01 2015 UTC,"I think if Pixar makes a sequel for Inside Out where they look at the emotions of an adult, Bill could star in a R-rated version of the movie where he vents his anger by swearing a lot."
BillBurr,3bqrx3,ZohanDvir,-12,Wed Jul 1 15:40:56 2015 UTC,Why shit on Jurassic world? I liked it more than this sappy movie. Never seen a Pixar movie just ask for tears more than this one. Why can't you enjoy them both? Or just say inside out was good and leave it at that? See that's the problem kids these days have to like one thing then shit on the other thing to be cool. Well I liked both but Dino's more.   Plus bills voice cracks when he's mad so I'll stick with Lewis black.

BillBurr,3bqk0a,yourkindhere,4,Wed Jul 1 11:04:00 2015 UTC,"I too think she's awesome and genuinely funny, but I much prefer the podcast when Bill is alone. I think he's at his best unfiltered when he's crazy, angry, and just outrageous. While he still is to a degree around Nia, she definitely keeps him in check. Seems great for his everyday life, but I will never laugh as hard with any guest really, especially Nia, as when he's alone"
BillBurr,3bqk0a,Jesus390,9,Wed Jul 1 12:04:06 2015 UTC,I typically don't like when he has any sort of guests. But I do enjoy Nia answering questions they've got a great back and forth chemistry. As far as guests go Stanhope was great too.
BillBurr,3bqk0a,rob-e_tha_robot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:05:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree I enjoy it but just do more so when he's solo. He's had some great guests I always enjoy virzi the most just because you can tell they're great friends
BillBurr,3bqk0a,olive_garden7,10,Wed Jul 1 13:14:48 2015 UTC,"Shes good in the right doses in the right times. She can be a wet blanket on certain topics, she tried to fry the hypothetical question thing before it even had a chance. But once bill turned it around a bit she became good. I remember once there was a question would you rather have a gay slut of a son, or a female slut of a daughter and she like stopped the whole podcast right there to rant about how homophobic and sexist it was. When I thought it woulda been hilarious to listen to bill burr most likely come to the conclusion that hed rather have a slutty gay son because its easier to be proud of a son slamming ass all over town than a daughter."
BillBurr,3bqk0a,Jesus390,3,Wed Jul 1 13:22:33 2015 UTC,"That's what I like about her being on the show, she's a little hypocritical at times. Like she gets angry at homophobia and sexism and stuff but will laugh her ass off when Bill says he's going to twist someone into a pretzel, stick them into a trunk and ass rape them. And she's pretty good about admitting when she gets too PC."

BillBurr,3bjsqo,HeIsMyPossum,14,Mon Jun 29 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"I tend to group the people I encounter in life into two categories: reasonable and unreasonable.

It's a shame, but maybe he won't be shaking hands after shows for much longer if these are the people he has to deal with..."

Billy was being real and genuine.  I think he legitimately felt bad, and wanted those people to fuck off.  Totally reasonable feelings.  The podcast and moments like this really make me a bigger fan of Bill."
BillBurr,3bjsqo,ThriceOnSundays,9,Tue Jun 30 04:03:56 2015 UTC,Burr shouldn't have even apologized. Fuck those assholes that gave him those tickets back. How could you possibly go to a comedy show and get offended like that. Those people are pathetic.

Jokingly asked so should I just give up teaching for comedy and he kind of just was like ""ya you can't talk shit about your coworkers"" and sort of dismissed me and moved on to the next in line.

BillBurr,3bjfjm,BigMike8,2,Mon Jun 29 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Retarded is one of those words I try really hard to avoid saying, not because I have anything against it, but because I know a lot of people with mentally handicapped family and friends and I don't want to make them uncomfortable. That being said, sometimes it slips out and (for the most part) nobody throws a fit about it. I think that's the way it should be: control yourself but you shouldn't be lynched for using it on accident."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,Leftieswillrule,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:12:51 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you meant to say you should NOT be lynched
BillBurr,3bjfjm,BigMike8,2,Thu Jul 2 15:33:52 2015 UTC,Thanks
BillBurr,3bjfjm,Leftieswillrule,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like ""political correctness gone mad"" but I also don't like people using that as an excuse to be racist or offensive just because, so I'm open to other opinions about it. But I think it's weird to be so sensitive about a single word and go to a comedy show and expect not to be offended.  I guess it's kind of weird to me that it's considered an offensive word now because when I was younger I'd say things like ""that's retarded"". It was just another way of saying that's stupid. It never really meant mentally handicapped people to me so it kind of seems like people being offended over the word stupid."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,esiotrot_soup,2,Mon Jun 29 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"It's like how faggot doesn't mean ""gay"" to a lot of people (see Louis CK's bit about this, quit being a faggot and suck that dick).  It's all societal stigma around saying ""retarded"" at this point.  If we are not calling the mentally disabled ""retarded"", can we at least call cunts retarded when they're being slow on the uptake?  And if I were the type of person that could be offended by anything, I probably would stay away from Billy Frecklefuck's shows."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,dellett,2,Mon Jun 29 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"It reminds me of that episode of the Office where Michael says ""you don't call retarded people retarded. You call your friends retarded when they're being retarded.""  I mean maybe I'm being ignorant because I don't have a family member with a mental handicap, so it doesn't affect me as much... I just think people need to have thicker skins at a comedy club or show. I get if teachers don't want kids using the word as an insult around the playground or whatever because it might actually hurt the feelings of a special ed kid nearby. But at a comedy show? It's not like Bill had a bit about how much he hates the mentally disabled. He just used the word retarded colloquially."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,esiotrot_soup,3,Mon Jun 29 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  Once when I was at work (office job), a guy who worked for my client said something was kind of retarded and then quickly tried to justify it by saying that his friend's sister's roommate's cousin was retarded (or something) so he could say it.  That's about as close as I could come to being offended, but mostly because it wasn't funny, he shied away from it without apologizing, and we were at work in a professional environment.  So overall I guess you could say he was acting a bit retarded."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,dellett,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"I get it 100%.  I used to say it all the time too.  Like I said, I'm not going to stand on a pulpit and scream at people to not use the word, but for me it feels wrong to say.  I also used to say fag a lot.  I chose to take that out of my vocabulary, and I've done the same with retarted.  Again, this is a personal decision for me."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,BigMike8,2,Mon Jun 29 22:28:14 2015 UTC,"Again, this is a personal decision for me.     Alright, I respect that. :)"
BillBurr,3bjfjm,esiotrot_soup,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:19:52 2015 UTC,It's tough being a comedian.
BillBurr,3bjfjm,Ahsoka23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:47:12 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a little humorous to see the juxtaposition of a few emotions:  1) You can obviously tell that he feels really bad about it. There are several times that he acknowledges that he shouldn't have said it, wishes he could take it back, and genuinely feels awful that he hurt their feelings.   2) He's definitely pissed off with the way they handled it. I think it was pretty rude to be that hurt and then to shove it all in his face like that was WAY over the top. Pulling out the picture of their mentally handicapped son? There's no reason to do that other than to make him feel bad. They would have gotten a genuine apology if they had approached him and said, ""Hey, I know it's a comedy show, but if you could try and not say retarded as an insult because it's very hurtful to us and our son."" I bet Bill would have really given them a sincere apology and admitted a mistake. But they totally threw it in his face and made him understandably defensive. I think in the end it also hurt his feelings to have his tickets thrown in his face like that. And because he was hurt, there was emotion 3 (see below)   3) He's definitely embarrassed about it. He even says it was one of the worst moments, what are the odds that all that would happen, etc. I think it's been bugging him a lot on a pretty deep level.   Basically,  he admitted he shouldn't have said retarded because he's made it a point not to do that in the past. However, they were definitely wrong in the way they handled it, and I think they really hurt his feelings. So both sides did damage to the other, and neither got closure on it.  Overall a shitty situation."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,BigMike8,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very shitty.  I couldn't agree more with you that this person handled it wrong.  It's okay to be offended and bring it to his attention, but showing the picture and handing the tickets back is not rational behaviour."
BillBurr,3bjfjm,djn808,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:17:29 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to people not knowing how to start a delicate conversation without being confrontational. It doesn't matter how reasonable or logical your argument actually is if you introduce yourself as a self righteous dickhead. No one will listen to you even if it's in their best interests.

BillBurr,3bjgut,plymouthvoyager,3,Mon Jun 29 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, I wonder what happened in Tucson."
BillBurr,3bjgut,GMane2G,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"I was at the show in Tucson last night.  No idea what happened.  He killed, the audience was putty in his hands, and nobody called out or really heckled.  I was like maybe 5th in line to see him--he was really chill and gave a great smile for the picture but was obviously tired.  He was cool when I asked him to write ""just checkin in on ya"" on the tour poster.  It was pretty obvious he was trying to push people through the line because there were a ton of people there--I dont know I felt a little like he wasnt feeling it.  At around the 36th minute of the podcast he shuts Nia up about it and she's like, ""but how are they gonna know?"" So obviously it was the fans in Tucson.  Strange cuz that's totally not how I saw it."
BillBurr,3bjgut,plymouthvoyager,2,Tue Jun 30 02:24:17 2015 UTC,"Ok cool. I had asked about it in the other thread too and a couple of other people that were there said the same about the show. I was guessing maybe it was an overzealous fan later in the line or something behind the scenes with the venue.  We'll see if we'll ever know. I'm guessing if it was a fan issue, he didn't want to bring it up because of the IE show he talked about earlier."
BillBurr,3bjgut,GMane2G,2,Tue Jun 30 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"You know what, I'm betting that it's cell phone use.  Considering how he was comparing the disposable camera use compared to now and how he's so quick to jump on someone with a phone.  Dont know how much I saw last night but it was a giant conference room and couldnt really see the front.  Not a great venue for comedy at all.  Both he and Lawhead shit on it and had great riffs on how they were motivational speakers or were there for a business conference."
BillBurr,3bjgut,plymouthvoyager,2,Tue Jun 30 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yikes and lol about the conference room. He's talked about the cell phone stuff before, though. I dont think it would have been such a big deal to mention.  I noticed on his Twitter he posted a picture from after the show with some guy by the tour bus. I looked at the replies to see if he was a celeb or something (I didn't recognize him), and someone mentioned that the guy couldn't get in the building but had waited outside until he could get a picture. I wonder if that freaked them out."
BillBurr,3bjgut,GMane2G,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I doubt it's the venue or behind the scenes stuff because it sounded like Nia wanted to tell the listeners and people that go to the show something, and Bill was like, nah even though they bugged me throughout the tour they are still my fans and I'll put up with it.  I was thinking of tweeting Nia and seeing if she'd see if Bill would think about telling us what happened in Tucson so as fans we could spread the word about what NOT to do at the show or in the line"
BillBurr,3bjgut,MeastST,3,Tue Jun 30 02:43:55 2015 UTC,I was at his show in the inland empire and it was my first live standup. I left wondering if this is how all live comedy events were because like he mentions on the podcast there were a bunch of drunk assholes yelling and whistling throughout  the show (they happened to be in my vicinity). He even mentioned that it wasn't even 930 yet and people were already hammered smh. I Got to meet him after so that was cool & I'm glad to know this type of crowd behavior isn't the norm.
BillBurr,3bjgut,smelfsmarted,4,Mon Jun 29 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"I was at that show, too. My husband and I were about 8 rows from the front, which was so exciting until the 3 loudest drunks seated their asses right beside us. I was relieved that their obnoxiousness didn't audibly garner them any positive or negative attention from Bill (or Lawhead, who they were quick to hate on before he proved his obvious-worth to their simple minds almost instantaneously), but my fuck, did that ever blow. One of them kept shouting Bill's name and the ever annoying ""it's so true!"" almost every time he laughed after a joke - including one part about having to screw a bunch of guys to survey their dick-size in regards to the vehicles they drive. Really, dude? Really. You've done that, it's so true? Great to know!   All that bitching aside, I laughed so hard that I could feel it for days after. I can't fucking wait for the next time."

BillBurr,3bjgut,aselectionofcheeses,2,Tue Jun 30 08:36:21 2015 UTC,"Her part was really funny this week. I usually don't mind her anyways, but this was one of her best segments in a while."
BillBurr,3bjgut,plymouthvoyager,2,Tue Jun 30 12:10:23 2015 UTC,"She was on fire.  Along with the Dirty Feet Bitches, ""Is it so wrong that I demand excellence?"", ""That's so many fucking dishes..."" and the veggie BBQ stuff had me dying."

BillBurr,3bgmbu,oh_jeeezus,21,Mon Jun 29 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Haha. This is great. He's always talking about how sponsors get upset with him for mangling the reads, etc., but it looks like he found a company that appreciates his shenanigans.  This is a perfect example, though, of how advertisers need to chill the fuck out and let content creators advertise products in their own style to their audience. It's why I think the big podcast advertisers (Squarespace, Audible, Dollar Shave Club, etc.) found so much initial success from advertising in the medium. But the more they're seeing it as a ""serious"" platform for their ads, and sending out more specific copy to be read, the more douchey it sounds and the less effective it is on me.   Having said that, Bill's classic reading of Shari's Berries' dumb-ass copy has forever etched their brand into my stupid brain."

Now when you go to see Bill, it's an event full of his rowdy fans, so they start to chime in. It can be annoying. At the SJ show the other night a guy yelled out ""Just checkin' in on yaaaaa"". I can't imagine how annoying it is to hear your bits shouted back at you over and over when you're trying to do your act.  It just comes with the territory of having success while your fanbase continues to grow. Like when they'd yell at Andy Kaufman to do his known bits, he grew so frustrated one time he opened up a book and started reading it on stage instead."
BillBurr,3ax4ak,dylansesco,11,Wed Jun 24 10:08:28 2015 UTC,"Man, I was about 2 feet away from one screaming idiot and about 4 feet away from another. Fatty 1 kept shouting ""Yeah!"" about every 5 seconds. He'd laugh as loud as he could about a second before each joke was even finished. Bill told him to shut the fuck up and the crowd erupted. I thought that might be the end of it, but it was not. After literally finishing his first 6 pack, he crashed into the aisle and I thought that might be the end of him, but this fatty came back with another. He took to burping and talking loudly with his girlfriend. The rest of the night he screamed, while Bill tried to ignore/tell him to stop. No amount of the surrounding crowd telling him to shut up seemed to phase him.  The other fatty kept yelling too. Every 10 minutes, he'd break into hysterics, ""BILL BURR FOR PRESIDENT, BILL BURR FOR PRESIDENT"", like a 14 year old girl that had just seen the Beatles. He kept trying to comment on all of Bill's bits. He kept making a hocking a loogie noise. Bill yelled something like ""you're not even saying stuff, you're just making noise"". Bill is pretty funny with the crowd, he'd try to get some banter going on with on with the girls, and fatty #2 would yell ""SUCK A DICK YOU BITCH!"" followed by fatty #1 yelling ""DON'T TALK WHEN MEN ARE TALKING"".  Jesus Christ, somebody kept shining a laser pointer at the set.  Fucking horrible, I missed so many jokes, probably a full quarter of of them."

Loved the gangland bit he did in the beginning  People heckling/shouting is pretty much common at comedy shows, alcohol was involved and personal feelings may get mixed with the audience. Happens everywhere. Any good comedian knows to make fun of them and try to make those people look like idiots.  I'm sure both you, myself and everyone on this subreddit know that Bill has been through something like this before (e.g. Philadelphia) For your enjoyment:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNnkDjMVJqE"

It was unique too because gangland made an episode on a local one called the ""Fresno Bulldogs"" (""borrowed"" from our state university's mascot). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyTekLm8EB4  So he imitated the guys that covered their faces and changed their voices for interviews and that got everyone going crazy.

It's awesome to see the seeds of a joke take form and then blossom later on into a seamless bit.   Honestly it's one of my favorite parts of listening to the podcast. Seeing an idea or a viewpoint form and then see how it uses that idea in a set.
BillBurr,3aqs1z,badattitude4u,6,Mon Jun 22 22:18:53 2015 UTC,His last special made me realize how much he works out bits on the podcast. It's perfect practice. It blew my mind seeing polished versions of the stuff he'd been talking about all year. I have a feeling there's gonna be some kind of poisoning of the food supply joke on his next one lol.

Show was awesome. He was working on material; many parts made their way into his latest special. His jokes about adopting foreign kids and then pinning them against themselves if he were their Dad was my favourite part of the show.   Paul Verzi opened the show. Wasn't bad. Wasn't great.

BillBurr,39pmp4,peopleare11,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:39:24 2015 UTC,Fan Tip: If tickets are sold out go to the venue on the day of the performance the second the box office is open earlier in the day. Ask if tickets have become available as the artist has released some reserved seats or if there's cancellations. From experience if you're early you'll get seats but not necessarily together if there's 2 of you.

I also liked ""Serial"" but it's a season long podcast broken into pieces, so you can't just listen willy-nilly.   Honorable mentions go to Car Talk (which isn't running any more, but is great to learn about car repair and is funny, as well as informative), to Ask Me Another (a trivia game show by NPR), and to Prairie Home Companion (which caters to an older audience, but still has its merits).  I also highly recommend going back to watch all episodes of the Red Green Show, which is a bit like ""Tool Time with Tim Taylor"" from a more public access point of view, and was wonderfully funny and wholesome, as well as enjoyable, but video, and not a podcast."

BillBurr,3929j9,ZohanDvir,5,Tue Jun 9 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"The laugh guy was really trying too hard. That might be the pettiest reason I've ever heard to dump someone who is otherwise ""wife material""."
BillBurr,3929j9,plymouthvoyager,3,Tue Jun 9 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"I swear Bill has read that 'punching an aspiring banker' letter before, about a year ago."
BillBurr,3929j9,dochattan,11,Tue Jun 9 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"For once I agree with Nia - there were no red flags with that girl. Biggest non-reasons to break up with someone I've ever heard. If anyone should be seeing red flags it's the girl - her dad and this guy are both very immature. And Bill and the guy are excessively paranoid.  Edit: it's possible this girl has a poor history with her father that would justify his reactions, but we don't know either way, so all judgment relevant to that should be reserved."
BillBurr,3929j9,destroyermaker,6,Tue Jun 9 06:43:07 2015 UTC,The dad was pretty justified in being pissed that his daughter was bringing booty calls back to his house. And if she doesn't see a problem with warning that guy about it it is kind of a red flaf
BillBurr,3929j9,yep45,0,Mon Jun 8 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"She's 20 something. Who cares? And to kick her out for it? Come on, there's clearly more going on here.  Plus, she could've genuinely not known he was home."
BillBurr,3929j9,destroyermaker,13,Wed Jun 10 11:23:55 2015 UTC,"You know what made me cringe the most about this? That the subject line of the email was ""girlfriend a whore?"".  I think it's absolutely hilarious that this is a guy who's only known her for a few months and when she lets HIM fuck her then ""oh it's perfectly fine, she is a great lady"", but the fact that she uses a vibrator, an inanimate object, ON HERSELF? OH MY GOD IS MY GIRLFRIEND A WHORE????? And that he's already assuming this girl who he likes is a whore  How the fuck do guys like this even get girlfriends?"
BillBurr,3929j9,brtdud7,9,Wed Jun 10 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this guy was a cunt."

I'm still laughing that he woke her up to get a different opinion, they came to the same basic conclusion from opposing angles, and he gets mad that she doesn't have the exact same opinion."
BillBurr,3929j9,plymouthvoyager,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"I forgot about that part. That's a major red flag against the guy. If Nia had heard that part, I'm sure we'd hear a very different take on it from her.  Haha yeah. Bill is a nutter. He thought she was hating all over the guy too, which she wasn't at all. I think she's just earned herself a reputation with him (and us), which works against her even when she's being reasonable."
BillBurr,3929j9,destroyermaker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why she never agrees completely is that these guys are writing in and always throwing the girls under the bus to save their pride. I think this guy was more embarrassed about the dad catching him and used her sexuality to dive behind instead of just being honest and saying, ""This bothered me because I ran into your Dad and I felt embarrassed."" Not to say that women don't do it either, but it feels like this kind of email keeps coming in from guys. It doesn't mean the girl gets away scot-free, but the punishment is always losing the relationship or losing trust.  I think this is the point that she is always trying to get at but she either gets caught up or he throws semantics and interrupts to drive her away from that point. And frankly, that struck me as really annoying this time."
BillBurr,3929j9,plymouthvoyager,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"I think the guy has serious issues with females but doesn't recognize it and automatically shifts the blame onto the girl instead, partly because he takes the wrong messages from Bill.  As men, we are right to take the ""crazy female"" position a lot of the time, but we also need to recognize when we are also being crazy, shitty, etc. or have some stuff to work on.  I wrote in about all this so hopefully he decides to read it Thursday or Monday."

BillBurr,3929j9,telepepper,3,Tue Jun 9 02:51:27 2015 UTC,"Nah dude, women are sexual beings too. Maybe she didn't know the dad was there or whatever too. Lots of possibilities other than the girl just being automatically crazy. The kid that wrote in sounded pretty immature."

He said he was going to come at it from a ""different angle that actually makes me feel like less of a man"".   I'm intrigued to hear his take because as you are probably well aware, stand ups across the nation are milking this thing for all it's worth. I'm sure Bill knows this and wants to try and make his material unique and we know if anyone can do it, it's him."
BillBurr,3929j9,Lyran_Outcast,8,Tue Jun 9 02:39:51 2015 UTC,milking this thing for all it's worth   It's called pop culture. Thats the point of it.  If she didn't want to be talked about she wouldn't have made it public

BillBurr,38ys1y,Tordar,4,Mon Jun 8 07:41:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I was really disappointed.
BillBurr,38ys1y,bleuchamp,2,Mon Jun 8 10:30:57 2015 UTC,It's probably because he was so expected to be on there that he wasn't relaxed enough to be himself.
BillBurr,38ys1y,bax101,0,Tue Jun 9 20:18:47 2015 UTC,I thought he was great. He didn't want to come on Seinfeld's show with nothing so he ran through some of the familiar stuff but he still killed.

At a certain point you just become an asshole campaigning against everything that's coming from someone who doesn't tell you that everything isn't your fault. Again, I'm not talking about what Billy Buttfuck is talking about in the clip. Just the assholes commenting on everything like they're carrying the flag for humanity. Nope. You're not.

BillBurr,38nn73,MrRykler,51,Fri Jun 5 11:33:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything against her personally. She just isn't entertaining and you can tell Bill knows it.   Bill Burr is the only podcast I listen to because it's just one dude without any annoying guests. Whenever she comes on he completely changes his demeanor. Whenever Bill tries to get the vibe going again she completely refuses to play along. It's just an annoying show at that point.  You can be happy they have chemistry as a couple but they aren't a fun podcast duo in the least. Doesn't make you a hater.  I'm surprised so many people love the ""Bill says something outrageous and Nia says OMG you're outrageous"" kind of humour. It's dry and predictable. That's the only dynamic she has to bring."

I wouldnt say I hate her, but when you sit someone down next to one of the best comedians (I've ever come to know of), it's not gonna be easy to shine haha.   ...just my 0.02"
BillBurr,38nn73,Dr_Oops,7,Fri Jun 5 12:11:29 2015 UTC,"I've only been listening to the podcast for maybe two months now, and I have to admit that last Monday's podcast with Nia was probably the best one I've heard yet."

BillBurr,38nn73,WestonP,8,Fri Jun 5 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"This exactly. I actually don't mind Nia if she's on for like 5-10 minutes, but Burr has to be alone to go off 100% on a rant, which results in his best material."
BillBurr,38nn73,jucestain,26,Fri Jun 5 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"She's too opinionated, interrupts, and often time derails the podcast.  I'm not saying she's a bad person or even that her personalty is bad, but I listen to hear Bill ramble not her.  I'm not trying to say anything bad about her, but about 90% of the time she is on, she ruins the podcast for me."

BillBurr,38nn73,Mc_B,36,Sat Jun 6 01:52:38 2015 UTC,"I dislike how she interrupts. It's like listening to a standup show where a heckler also has a mic.  A lot of times, Bill will be gearing up for a rant and she'll cut him off. And usually it's not like her interruptions are even funny or insightful. She's usually just tone policing Bill about saying something offensive. Or she's expressing her outrage about his incorrect wording.  After she interrupts, there's a couple routes the podcast can take:   Ol' Billy Boy's learning disability kicks in and he forgets what he was going to say. Bill gets defensive and defaults back to his old material (""how many female scientists are there?!"") instead of exploring the topic he was ranting about before Nia interrupted. Nia starts guilt tripping him and Bill goes into ""maybe I'm just an angry old man"" apology mode.   I dunno. I just hate crosstalk. I can't watch The View or The O'Reilly Factor or any of those other interview/argument shows where people are just yelling over each other. I get that Nia and Bill aren't being serious, but I still don't find that kind of crosstalk enjoyable."
BillBurr,38nn73,BongHits4AquaBuddha,-7,Fri Jun 5 13:51:38 2015 UTC,Nia is on the podcast because Bill invites her onto it knowing exactly how it's gonna go. she isn't interrupting anyone.
BillBurr,38nn73,FUCKBOY_JIHAD,12,Fri Jun 5 15:26:46 2015 UTC,Nia isn't bad. But I don't think Bill can go 100% Burr around her. I don't mind when she's on with him for like 5-10 minutes but if she's on for most of the podcast it can get a little annoying. I actually think Burr does his best podcasts alone just cause he can really bring the hammer when he rants without having to appeal to anyone else's feelings.

On every podcast or interview, their goal is to build Bill up and laugh at his jokes. Nia just gets to come in and rag on him and it's great. I love how last Thursday he was talking about the Monday Morning Podcast and talked about how bad she burned him.  I love hearing the two of them. I actually think she had a pretty understanding piece about Bruce/Caitlin Jenner. I don't like the Social Justice Warriors either, but she just brought up some good points about how this stuff works.  I mean let's face it... Big ol' Billy can be a little ignorant sometimes. I think Nia is a pretty intelligent lady and I like hearing her opinion. Sure, not for everyone, but I love the two of them blasting each other over everything."

I thought it was great material for bill to ponder but she said no so okay.
BillBurr,38nn73,Jesus390,3,Sat Jun 6 12:45:00 2015 UTC,Ugh this is the epitome of buzzkill. Disappointed Bill didn't tell her to suck it up

BillBurr,38nn73,Mc_B,3,Sat Jun 6 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"My god soo much Nia hate in here. I like Nia, and while I wouldn't want her on the podcast every time, it's so great when Bill has been ranting about Jim irsay for 3 weeks in a row and then she comes on. It just adds a different dynamic. They make a great couple"
BillBurr,38nn73,KenNoisewater_PHD,3,Sat Jun 6 07:29:13 2015 UTC,I love it when Bill tells her to shut the fuck up or get out.  He even knows she ruins the podcast.
BillBurr,38nn73,ThatGuyBradley,4,Sat Jun 6 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I have nothing against Nia, she seems like a perfect match for Billy Internet Illiterate. Interesting that after like 8 hours this was posted everyone is getting downvoted for expressing their opinions.  But yeah, the podcast when her and Bill were going on about the woman inventors and shit was one of the funniest things Ive ever heard on the podcast. Nia is really great when she trades banter with Billy-boy, those bits are always solid gold. But given that, she can drag the mood down at times and blow the wind out of Bills sails. It is his podcast after all."
BillBurr,38nn73,Pripiit,6,Fri Jun 5 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"I love the concept of her. But I absolutely don't hate her, and anyone who can't wrap their head around the fact that Bill married Nia is really a moron. She has a zealous attitude, and I would like some conflict in the podcast, but yeah sometimes I feel like I am arguing with her for some reason."
BillBurr,38nn73,RationalArgumentMan,2,Fri Jun 5 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"90% of the time she's okay, but man that 10% is the worst.  She's obnoxious, and desperately tries to make everything an issue about sexism/misogyny by assuming all kinds of things without even hearing Bill tell her the whole story because she interrupts him so much.  Everytime she goes into feminazi-mode, it's like having a friend whose girlfriend tagged along for guy's night out and then just brings everyone down by turning everything into a sexism debate.  Even if I ignored all the stuff I mentioned above, her hypocrisy is just disgusting. She's so blatantly leaching off of Bill's success financially, yet she constantly rants about gender equality and blah blah blah. She's all for other women being successful and financially independent, but it's completely okay for her to be Bill's tagalong wife. I don't even have a problem with wives/husbands who tagalong, but the fact that she's so high and might is just the worst.  My partner loves when Nia gets in on the podcast (she hates Bill Burr-- go figure), but even she rolls her eyes when Nia goes on her rants. Nia minus the feminist bullshit = really cool woman.  Also a bit unrelated, but anyone else think Nia sounded drunk on today's MMPC?"

Yeah, she says aggressive and ignorant shit sometimes.  So does Bill."
BillBurr,38nn73,ZohanDvir,7,Fri Jun 5 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"Bill loves sports. Nia's going on about her boring life where she stays home in a filthy house and watches 5 episodes of the Kardashians that she DVR'd while taping over Fast and Loud. Bill wants to spice up the podcast and brings up the NBA finals. Nia's response and the way she said it, ""oh is that going on now?"" made me turn it off and wait til Monday for 'ol frenchy freckles."
BillBurr,38nn73,ImLivingLikeLarry,5,Fri Jun 5 21:09:04 2015 UTC,I love her and think of her pretty much the same way as you. She and he arguing makes the podcast so much better.

BillBurr,38nn73,BillFireCrotchWalton,3,Fri Jun 5 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone takes her so seriously. The idea that she's some sort of feminazi/SJW/tumblrina gets thrown around semi-frequently on here, and I've seen like 10 people say something like ""how could he ever marry her?"" (paraphrasing). Whenever Bill goes on his ignorant rants about whores and cunts or whatever, everyone just laughs and doesn't take him seriously, nor should they."
BillBurr,38nn73,rentedthegorilla,2,Fri Jun 5 21:05:14 2015 UTC,I personally love when she comes on. I think she brings out a side of Bill that only she probably can. I would be totally fine if the TAMMP was always the two of them. /serious
BillBurr,38nn73,099992,3,Fri Jun 5 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"As a female listener, she is a much needed break for me. I love bill, been a fan for years, been to 3 of his shows. But its a very male-oriented podcast, so she is a breath of fresh air for the female listeners."
BillBurr,38nn73,ZohanDvir,6,Fri Jun 5 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"To paraphrase Bill on women & the NFL, it annoys them that men can just sit there in their element and enjoy themselves and they have to jealously destroy the simple male brain that yields true happiness. They don't want their own stuff, but always want our stuff because we're happy."
BillBurr,38nn73,KenNoisewater_PHD,2,Fri Jun 5 17:40:03 2015 UTC,That's a great point I hadn't thought of. Maybe Bill realizes he does have female listeners and is trying to balance his material out a bit with Nia.

BillBurr,38nn73,bigblackcouch,4,Fri Jun 5 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"See, for me it goes either way. Last Monday's podcast with Nia there like, 75% of the podcast I thought was great, it was a change of pace, funny and entertaining, and she had some great riffing and she gave Bill shit, he gave her shit.  ...But I turned off this Thursday's podcast about 20 minutes into it. I'm not sure what the big difference was, but it was really grating on me. It does get old when she keeps interrupting him to shout about his ignorant thoughts, which he doesn't get to actually finish voicing to even know if what he was saying was ignorant. I'm not a sports maniac but I can stomach listening to Billy Madden stumble his way through commentating on whatever sport he's into at the moment.  Reality shows and the Kardashians and shit, eh. I just don't give a shit about that. I realize that form of entertainment is geared towards someone other than me, but ehhhhhhhh... It's not something that's normally a part of Bill's podcast.  So, I don't get the hate for her or anything, and I like her as a presence, but not when she's the star of the show. I don't give a shit about reality TV or politically correctness, I just want to hear my favorite illiterate freckled fuck get pissed the hell off at his recorder."

I like it because it's interesting. Also hilarious, but I like seeing where my POV fits in with the discussion.    When she gets on her high horse, just remember his is waiting at the stable right next to hers. They do the same things to each other, she knows that she isn't a comedian, and I don't think she is trying to be.  And all these people trashing them personally or trashing their lifestyle, well, you're just being rude. Either send respectful feedback or move on when she comes on."

BillBurr,386z8e,bretstar,2,Tue Jun 2 23:16:55 2015 UTC,Well she's accustomed to a lash life style so she'd probably take him for more than half and 20-30% of any future earnings. Wouldn't be surprised if she took the dog too.

BillBurr,386z8e,Linrraba,12,Tue Jun 2 18:15:49 2015 UTC,I like her but she can be a real buzzkill sometimes. Bill tells her as such outright.
BillBurr,386z8e,destroyermaker,4,Tue Jun 2 18:41:26 2015 UTC,I've literally never heard her complain about anything on the podcast that Bill doesn't specifically bring to her attention and I think I've heard all the episodes featuring her.

BillBurr,386z8e,cbg79,9,Tue Jun 2 14:03:33 2015 UTC,"Women are hilarious. I like Nia, and even though I completely disagree with some of the things she says when she gets on the podcast, I still find her to have strong character and funny to boot. However, it's weird hearing her vent like this, because it really makes her sound like such a typical woman.   How can a woman find it within themselves to whine about being taken care of? How can a woman find it within themselves to resent the opportunities that a man provides for her? The hypocrisy in both reveling in Bill's success with the freedom to do and buy what she wants, yet blaming this as the cause of her depression is so confusing to me. Women are just never happy! Haha!   Oh well, she'll figure it out. She has every opportunity in the world to pursue her dreams, and maybe she shouldn't qualify them by whether they contribute the same amount of money as Bill's. Think about what he does in his spare time. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, works on his truck, plays hockey with friends and now the dude is flying fucking helicopters. Why? Because he felt like it. He followed his passions and interests.  Find yourself Nia. Be the feminist you claim to be, and stop qualifying yourself by competing with your man. You're not Bill. Go be Nia and do some cool shit."

The hypocrisy in both reveling in Bill's success with the freedom to do and buy what she wants, yet blaming this as the cause of her depression is so confusing to me. Women are just never happy! Haha!    I didn't read it that way at all.  I didn't read it as blaming Bill so much as falling into the trap of being too comfortable and needing to get her ass in gear.  My take is that she was owning how silly it was to be indignant toward Bill but then realize that she really wasn't motivated.  It seemed like a pretty reasonable take on the situation."
BillBurr,386z8e,ThriceOnSundays,2,Tue Jun 2 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"No, I absolutely understand that. The point of the article is her essentially coming to terms with this. Regardless though whether she eventually owned up to it, I find it mind boggling that people can let themselves fall into that line of thinking to begin with. I'm just a very self aware person, perhaps. I inventory my behavior and account for my feelings constantly."
BillBurr,386z8e,Wambo45,3,Tue Jun 2 22:05:53 2015 UTC,She kind of takes note of that point too. I could see how easy it is to feel guilty at first and then to cover it  with useless activities that ultimately leave you unfulfilled. It's a slow process that took a toll on herself and she didn't have the courage or the determination to do anything about it.
BillBurr,386z8e,ratunnels,0,Tue Jun 2 22:47:27 2015 UTC,Well hopefully she's found something cool and fulfilling since writing the article.
BillBurr,386z8e,Wambo45,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:12:47 2015 UTC,"Woman here. I identify a lot with her article (completely different situation but I am currently recognizing similar feelings in myself). I don't think it's gender-specific. People hit motivational slumps all the time. Feeling that you are not valuable in terms of your financial contribution to your family, or feeling vulnerable due to a lack of independent financial security can arouse confusing and conflicting feelings in any relationship.  I get the impression that she has been working on her own stuff, and based on her social media, she's got her own cool hobbies and interests that she chooses to share. Podcasts can only tell so much selectively."

Sometimes I wonder what Bill fills his days with (when he's not on tour or traveling) when he's doing his podcast and says ""he has a lot to do today"", but it sounds like Nia is basically like a housewife but there's no house to wife, no kids, nothing like that.

I know I would, and I would absolutely love to be rich enough to have my girlfriend stay home without making her a 1950's housewife/maid. Chill.  There's an annoyingly large amount of genuine misogynist fans of comedy like burr's that are just as bad as the blogger feminist jerk offs that take jokes for actual philosophy. nia is a delight, and the podcast is always funnier when you hear the two bitch at each other, because freckleface shuts up about drums and canadian hockey teams when she's on to talk about social issues and shit. If you get pissed off that she gets asked to talk on the podcast and comes with a strong and sometimes different opinion than burr, you're a douche bag. stop trying to live in an echo chamber. besides, bill either wins the argument readily, or concedes defeat after it becomes obvious he isn't well educated in the topic.  chill the fuck out people."

BillBurr,37k0ep,noshelter,2,Thu May 28 17:23:11 2015 UTC,You'd figure he'd prefer to say Carver since it gives him another chance to flex that Boston accent.
BillBurr,37k0ep,HongManChoi,2,Thu May 28 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think that DSC cares about the traffic that Billy Boy drives to their site - I'm pretty sure once you subscribe to the razors, they could offer you Dr Carters Sleazy Slave Butter and you'd probably figure out that's what Red Nuts was yelling about and either buy it or not.  I can't find it at the moment, but at some point I read an article with a quote from one of Bill's sponsors essentially saying that even if what Bill says isn't what they would advertise, it is the voice that appeals to Bill's fans, and they have no problems with his riffing during the live reads so long as it drives traffic to them.  I want to say it was Shari's Berries of all sponsors - but it might have been pro flowers or some such.  For his sponsors, it's really win-win:  they get to have an ad that while wouldn't work if they put it out, works to appeal to a particular audience.  If it gets extra plays (like Shari's Berries) then that's totally free advertising.  I bet DSC absolutely loves the live reads that Bill does and doesn't care one bit about how he pronounces their shave cream."

BillBurr,37gd1r,rhythem45,-4,Wed May 27 13:54:53 2015 UTC,this last podcast of his he was pretty mean to Nia. I wont be surprised if he comments this thursday about how Nia was probably pissed after it.

I was thinking about signing up anyway (a lot of things on amazon don't ship internationally, which you conveniently find out when you get to the last fucking stage of checkout). From what I understand say you buy three things off amazon, they'll receive them and hold on to them, then you put in a request to throw them all in one box and ship it so you just pay for the one item to be shipped. It's not ideal but it's all us hemispherically challenged people can do :/"

BillBurr,378ovz,one_of_those1,18,Mon May 25 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first couple of times I heard Nia get into an argument with Bill I thought she was annoying. Then I realized they're not taking eachother too seriously and laugh it off a couple seconds later. That's a pretty cool thing to be able to do in a relationship."
BillBurr,378ovz,TheWindWaker01,5,Tue May 26 00:49:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree with both of you bastards.
BillBurr,378ovz,smelfsmarted,3,Tue May 26 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"It's both. She was really annoying when she was going off about the guy at the bar at the first opportunity. Bill apologized during it for bringing her on. I was like, thanks Bill."
BillBurr,378ovz,destroyermaker,12,Wed May 27 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never got why so many people seem to hate Nia and call her an SJW or feminist or whatever  Yeah she usually defends the woman at least at first but then whenever Bill says ""offensive"" stuff about women or says cunt or whatever, Nia thinks it's hilarious and always usually adds some legitimately funny stuff too.  And then people say ""OMG how can Bill like someone like her!?!?"" when she's basically him in female form."
BillBurr,378ovz,brtdud7,17,Tue May 26 03:20:52 2015 UTC,Exactly. Nia plays it up just like bill does. They're both argumentative and hold strongly to their opinion. they're a lot alike

BillBurr,378ovz,djn808,-3,Wed May 27 00:52:20 2015 UTC,Because she calls herself a feminist? And goes off on crazy rants about ridiculous shit like the guy at the bar story that episode. Women are all too eager to get upset these days.
BillBurr,378ovz,destroyermaker,-7,Wed May 27 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"Dude, the only woman that could handle Bill is a strong black woman."

BillBurr,378ovz,DULLKENT,10,Tue May 26 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"I know it's taboo amongst fans to criticize Nia since her backlash, but it is still a valid argument to say that she can get annoying and drag the podcast down. In her early appearances (pre-2012 ish), I thought she was a great complement to Bill when all she did was laugh and interject little comments here and there. It was around the time when she thought she could sustain a podcast on her own (anyone remember her plans for the 'Bitch Please' podcast?) that she became insufferable. From then on, she would try to match wits with Bill while representing the woman's perspective, but she didn't bring anything new or fun to the table, and it really stifled the podcasts flow. Ever since Bill's plea for everyone to stop being so vicious towards his wife online, I've felt bad and tried to give her another try, but anytime Bill says ""it's the lovely Nia everyone"" I hope and pray her airtime is kept to a minimum."
BillBurr,378ovz,oh_jeeezus,4,Wed May 27 14:57:24 2015 UTC,When and where did Bill address people's criticisms of Nia? I missed that.

BillBurr,378ovz,oh_jeeezus,1 point,Thu May 28 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's gotten really nasty before (hateful and of course, some of it is racist), and I'm sure people tweet her directly too.

BillBurr,371q57,Jesus390,11,Tue May 26 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell I think Bill and Louis have an interesting relationship. The fact that people question it is evidence that there is something slightly odd. I know that there has never been anything but good words said by Bill toward Louis, but still. Something feels off.  Its likely bullshit, and likely that its just in my head, but its also in a lot of other people's heads. Honestly why do people even bring it up? Clearly something is making people question it, right?  I think it may have something to do with the fact that they are both currently fairly prominent, had extremely similar starts, are a similar age, are both redheads, are both offensive in a unique and observational way, both have very similar audience demographics, and yet they have completely contrary attitudes, views, and personalities. I have a sense that as people they would potentially dislike each other. Again I'm likely completely wrong, but thats just what I think, being a massive fan of both."
BillBurr,371q57,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,15,Sun May 24 13:10:22 2015 UTC,"I like to think it stems from 2 very different views of Boston. Bill and Louis are both from Boston. Bill has a Boston accent,supports all their teams etc. Louis is kind of impartial to Boston, even though he grew up there. In one of Louis C.K's stand ups he talks about how everything bad that has ever happened to him, happened in Boston. In an episode of Louie he goes back to Boston, and he has a miserable time."
BillBurr,371q57,AluminiumMind93,6,Sun May 24 15:18:43 2015 UTC,I think the difference is Bill burr is upbeat and doesnt fall into depression like louis does.

Second one from very recently: http://defamer.gawker.com/louis-c-k-will-call-you-up-to-talk-about-his-alleged-s-1687820755  Sounds like unsubstantiated bullshit to me, especially considering the first accusations."
BillBurr,371q57,BillFireCrotchWalton,3,Mon May 25 20:19:03 2015 UTC,I believe it was the first episode of the Late Night Show arc on Louie that the episode started with a shot outside of a comedy place in LA and Bills name was on top of the sign out front. Next we see Louie on stage finishing up and when he walks through the doors to get off stage you can hear Bills voice in the back ground. When I met Bill in Boston last week I wanted to ask him about that but I completely forgot.
BillBurr,371q57,bostonbruins922,2,Tue May 26 20:30:55 2015 UTC,What he say?
BillBurr,371q57,rhythem45,10,Sun May 24 05:40:17 2015 UTC,"While Louie was being kind of abrasive and didn't want to talk with the driver. He told the driver he hates touring and it's just something he has to do. He doesn't like traveling and staying in places he's not used to.  Louie was comparing his disdain for touring to how guys like Bill love going on tour. Bill always talks on the podcast about how he loves traveling and meeting people and doing things he doesn't usually do. I don't know if it was resentment from Louie towards comics like Bill, jealousy, or no particular negative feelings at all- people are just different.  It was kind of a weird episode, and that scene was uncomfortable because there wasn't really anything funny about it and kind of made Louie seem like stuck-up dick."

Makes me wonder why he's a comic when he seems to hate it. He hates traveling, which is essential to being a comedian. He's the opposite of a people's person, which most comedians are. I wonder how he can even get enjoyment from comedy and making people laugh when he doesn't even seem to like people that much."

BillBurr,371q57,Provetie,0,Tue May 26 00:58:34 2015 UTC,I can see Louis CK quitting stand-up to become a film-maker / actor full time. He seems to think of that as the next step. He definitely has some kind of hipster / quirky artist attitude coming off him. Only problem is that most if his series is neither art nor funny.
BillBurr,371q57,colonelcardiffi,2,Thu May 28 07:35:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not confident it was a ""shout-out"" as much as it was a relevant reference. Louie was being taken to a night club to do a comedy show by a queer driver, when the driver says to him the last comedian there was Billy Burr. I think it was kind of meant to contrast Louie and Bill's comedy style, as way of showing Louie was a fish out of water in some sense.  It's very likely Louie didn't even need to get Ole Billy Bluebelt's permission for use of his name."

BillBurr,36ofi6,MAY_BE_TOM_BRADY,28,Thu May 21 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Man seriously Bills sports talk is my favourite part of his show and I'm sick of people writing in telling him to stop it. He's a big sports fan and so am I, it helps me relate to his podcast so much more that he enjoys football and goes off on it. I dunno why so many of you hate sports it's a fucken tragedy."
BillBurr,36ofi6,brtdud7,17,Wed May 20 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'm really amazed that so many Burr listeners dislike sports. Like the type of person Bill is with his personality, anger, dumbness, etc you would think that it's sports watchers who would love him, not these ""sports are evil and boring! pushes glasses up on nose""  nerds."
BillBurr,36ofi6,well_done_mate,4,Thu May 21 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"I love sports but I also don't live in the US or follow many US sports, so all his NFL and hockey talk go over my head. Which is fine because it's usually funny anyway and I can figure it out well enough to understand, but the whole Tom Brady deflategate thing has gotten really tiresome."

But even besides that, sometimes it's entertaining whether or not I know what he's talking about or not. So I'm glad he talks about it. Sometimes I'm bored but meh, sometimes I'm bored by non-sports talk. It's part of the podcast, you take the good with the bad."

BillBurr,36ofi6,brtdud7,1 point,Thu May 21 13:24:13 2015 UTC,Kobe has been one of the top 5 biggest names in sports for 15 years. That's pretty pathetic that you can't even spell his name right.  Or I guess you're one of the huge anti-sports nerds we talked about before
BillBurr,36ofi6,bax101,0,Thu May 21 21:17:29 2015 UTC,I'm neither actually....asshole. So quit your crying about my spelling and get on with your life.
BillBurr,36ofi6,dellett,0,Thu May 21 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"But seriously he has been saying the exact same thing on both Mondays and Thursdays for like three weeks now about the whole Deflategate thing.  He's been no better than the ESPN anchors who say ""is this still really a story???"" and then proceed to rehash it for 15 minutes."
BillBurr,36ofi6,brtdud7,5,Thu May 21 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"Bill has literally, and I mean literally, been doing the same ""complain about Jim Irsay"" bit on his podcast for three years."
BillBurr,36ofi6,destroyermaker,3,Thu May 21 02:06:18 2015 UTC,You don't mean literally.
BillBurr,36ofi6,brtdud7,-1,Thu May 21 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"No, actually I do mean literally.   I found the MMPC in November of 2014 and listened to 2014 and 2013 in full by February or March. I also started 2012 and got through February but then stopped, and I distinctly remember that in the January 2012 podcast somewhere he talked about Jim Irsay being a baby and changing the rules, and he talks about it basically every single year in NFL playoff time.  I have no problem with Bill complaining about Jim Irsay, but seriously it is his most frequently used bit on his podcast and has been for years. He also talked about Irsay on his Bill Maher appearance and I think on an appearance he has made on one of those cable NFL analyst shows too. I get that he's upset because he specifically changed rules because of the Patriots but he needs to give it a rest when it isn't needed (this pathetic DeflateGate notwithstanding)"
BillBurr,36ofi6,ShylockMcGee,1 point,Thu May 21 06:30:19 2015 UTC,"Bill is a Patriots fan and hates Jim Irsay like all Patriots fans do. I'm not a Patriots fan, I'm a Saints fan and the Patriots can go fuck themselves but I don't mind Bill talking about whatever the hell he wants to talk about, it's his podcast."

Occasionally he will mention ones in his other podcasts, but usually its just Paul Virzi's one...  personally, I would probably listen to some of Joe Rogan's - they are like 3 hours long, so i tend to just pull out guests that i think i'll enjoy.

It would also explain a bit why Rone had a serious section within his attack.  Either way thanks for opening me to the world of battle rap.

BillBurr,35z0hp,plymouthvoyager,-4,Fri May 15 02:10:58 2015 UTC,Everyone wants to argue about how Ray Rice hit his wife and Big Ben raped a girl. That's fine and dandy but at end of day that's not a NFL issue its a personal legal issue nothing to do with the NFL. What Brady and patriots did is directly effect of the NFL they cheated. It's directly in the rules don't do THIS and they did it. The Patriots are #1 in not fumbling the football with 78 touches for every fumble. The next best is in the 50's. Is everyone just that worse or do you think a deflated football stays in your hand a little better? There's a reason they did it as well and boggles my mind Bill can't see that. All he wants to do is ignore rational thinking. All your team needs to do is follow the rules and won't get in trouble stop making excuses for not following the rules. He comes off childish when he rants about it imo. I realize prolly be down voted for this but oh well.
BillBurr,35z0hp,Nismolover,9,Thu May 14 21:06:30 2015 UTC,Iirc they were beating the colts with their own ball first

I think Bill has a good point when he says if you looked under all the jock straps for evidence of cheating you would find it. So if everyones cheating in some small way to gain an advantage but the Colts still get railed doesn't that mean the Patriots are still a better team anyhow?
BillBurr,35z0hp,erneweit,2,Fri May 15 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"Or it could be because Bill Belichick greatly emphasizes control of the ball.  In 2013, the Pats #1 running back was benched for two games after fumbling just twice.  What other team would even do that?  BB hates fumbles and if you're a fumbler, you don't last long on his team.  And all this is hilarious coming from a Packers fan when your QB admitted to over inflating the balls in the hopes that the refs wouldn't notice."
BillBurr,35z0hp,HongManChoi,-2,Fri May 15 01:49:17 2015 UTC,Any evidence of that ? I'm pretty sure all he said was he rather have the ball over inflated then under so learn how to get facts straight. Next this is second time patriots bull this were breaking the rules but everyone does it bs it's comical how hard you guys defend this organization. Also if had nothing to hide why fire the equipment manager that you  had for years and declared was innocent lol. P.s the packers still beat your team I recall

BillBurr,35z0hp,MAY_BE_TOM_BRADY,0,Thu May 14 22:17:37 2015 UTC,So instead of having any defense and admitting your team fucked up you go to name calling stay classy Boston fans. FYI I rather my team not go down as cheaters.

BillBurr,35rd4x,LtCthulhu,4,Wed May 13 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard Bill's take on this, but if it is as this meme suggests then I think he's letting his love for his team blind him.  He has always maintained that dumb sportsmen doing dumb scumbag things are not a sporting matter - let the cops sort it out and all that.   On the other hand, Brady was found to have cheated to gain an advantage in a sport - on his way to winning the Superbowl, no less - and the sports body found him guilty and punished him. It was the only one that has to do with sports"
BillBurr,35rd4x,domfitz,3,Wed May 13 13:41:28 2015 UTC,I'm not a Pats fan but I agree with him that it's a travesty. I'm embarrassed for people that think it's a good punishment.

I don't think Tom is any better or worse with differently inflated balls, I just think he is more comfortable with less inflated balls. But he did break a rule so he must accept the punishment. This ordeal doesn't diminish the greatness of Tom Brady in my eyes though, and I'm not even a Pats fan."

To download it, you need to right-click on the link and select ""save link"", ""save target"" or something similar.  If you want every episode from 2011-2013 your best bet is a download manager that you can use on the libsyn site to automate the process as much as possible.   Btw, and I only say this as a heads up in case you weren't aware - the podcast goes all the way back to 2007."

It was sold out for the full ten or whatever days except the night I got, and I only checked the day after he announced it!"
BillBurr,35nb8h,MrWinks,4,Tue May 12 06:42:23 2015 UTC,I was there 10 minutes before the show started and I didn't have any issues.  Paul Virzi was the opener. He was way better than I expected an opener to be. Bill was phenomenal.

BillBurr,35nb8h,MrWinks,2,Tue May 12 06:43:46 2015 UTC,"I can help you out, Boston local and went Saturday night.  The Wilbahhh is downtown, no easy parking.   You're going to pay 30 to 40$ to park.  A better idea would maybe to find free parking and Uber to the show, might save you $20.  For instance, I live in South Boston and we have free street parking on the weekends.  You could park here and train or Uber there.  Once in, people will show you to your seat and it's easy as can be.  I got one large harpoon (cash only guy on balcony) which was two bottles dumped in a cup for $15.  Any other questions, feel free to ask"

BillBurr,35nb8h,deburn81,11,Fri May 15 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"If Bill stays true to form, he'll bring up Jim Irsay being a whiny brat again.  The penalty is absolutely ridiculous. 4 games, $1M in fines and draft picks lost. That is excessive compared to other things like how the NFL handled the Ray Rice incident and the Saints' bountygate etc.  Ironically since Brady is out 4 games, the first game he returns to is against the Colts!  Doesn't matter, all that at the cost of getting Brady his 4th Superbowl? I'd take that any day. This won't tarnish his reputation of being a champ.  PS. this is coming from a Raiders fan."
BillBurr,35nb8h,farfromittherehomie,2,Mon May 11 23:16:31 2015 UTC,I think part of the penalty is because it's off the heels of Spygate.

BillBurr,35nb8h,jimbonics,1 point,Thu May 14 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"Was it wrong and should they be punished for it?  Absolutely.  Did they deserve to lose their 1st round pick over it?  No way.  This situation is the same.  The NFL doles out its punishments based on public outrage.  They don't care about fairness, they only care about their image."
BillBurr,35nb8h,HongManChoi,1 point,Fri May 15 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of that. I think the terms of this punishment are a direct reflection of how bad they botched ray rice, and to a lesser degree Peterson.   They can't go soft anymore.  2 games for Brady. I don't feel sorry about the draft pick, so close to spygate. Fucking idiots texting about it. 1 mil seems excessive, hope that goes to charity or something.   The irony here? Irsay wasn't wrong, and he and the colts are being vilified, like any other whistleblower."
BillBurr,35nb8h,jimbonics,1 point,Fri May 15 02:21:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of that. I think the terms of this punishment are a direct reflection of how bad they botched ray rice, and to a lesser degree Peterson.    I'd like to agree with you there, but the Vikings were only fined $25,000 for tampering with the balls by setting them next to a heater (in fact, $25,000 is supposed to be what the fine for tampering with the balls is, why were the Pats punished so much more harshly for the same thing?) and Falcons were fined $350,000 and only lost a 5th round pick for pumping god damn crowd noise into the stadium (something Irsay's Colts have also been accused of).  Both of those punishments came after Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson's and they're both slaps on the wrist.  In any case, the punishment would be more acceptable if there was actual proof in the report, but there isn't.  The evidence is circumstantial at best.  It's full of probably's and maybe's, but no definitely's.  This is why the punishment is so tough to swallow as a Pats fan."
BillBurr,35nb8h,HongManChoi,1 point,Fri May 15 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"probably's and maybe's   I think that was more CYA verbiage than anything. The guy isn't an attorney or judge in something like this. He can't pass legal judgement. He gives an onion based on his findings. This isn't being handed over to a federal prosecutor.   Goodell is judge (and jury) based on those findings.  It's funny, last year they're too lenient, now they're too harsh. They can't win."

BillBurr,35626u,marcsmart,1 point,Thu May 7 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"I love old freckles, but he's way off base on the Tom Brady deflated footballs issue.  There is a zero percent chance that Brady didn't know and encourage the cheating.  The only reason the wording is so weak in the report is because they don't have a smoking gun - mostly because Tom refused to cooperate with the investigation.  Here's what you need to know: -- Text messages between a part-time New England Patriots employee and an equipment assistant with talk of cash, free shoes and autographs.  -- The part-time employee -- a locker room attendant responsible for 12 footballs before the AFC title game -- spending 100 seconds in a bathroom after game officials had approved the balls for play.  -- Measurements taken at halftime after a team that is losing tips off the league about footballs that appear to be too soft.  -- The Patriots' star quarterback and the equipment assistant suddenly exchanging phone calls in the days just after news of underinflated footballs blew up.  I'm sure the NFL will pretend that this is just an isolated incident and hold the part time employee and the equipment manager responsible, but does any reasonable person think they would deflate the footballs if their quarterback didn't want them deflated?    There is also no chance an NFL quarterback doesn't know exactly how a football feels when it's inflated at different levels.  I get that the Patriots are a very talented team and the footballs don't account for a blowout, but there is no way Brady isn't dirty."
BillBurr,35626u,ThriceOnSundays,4,Fri May 8 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"He wasn't saying Brady wasn't a part of it, he was just saying it doesn't make enough of a difference to matter at all. It was more of a rant about the Colts being ""crybabies"" than whether they broke a rule."
BillBurr,35626u,jayfer04,2,Fri May 8 16:25:47 2015 UTC,I really didn't care for the football stuff either. I have literally not heard a single person say that ball deflation was responsible for the blowout or more generally that the Patriots are only good because they cheat...and pretty much the entirety of Bill's rant is against people who think the Patriots only win because they cheat.
BillBurr,35626u,BillFireCrotchWalton,2,Fri May 8 02:01:59 2015 UTC,Yeah - people generally acknowledge the Patriots and Brady are an excellent football team and player.  That's not really the debate.  But I give Billy Boy a pass because he's so up front almost all the time about how he talks out of his ass on many topics.  I bet he comes back in the future and realizes that Brady knew about it and wanted the balls deflated.
BillBurr,35626u,ThriceOnSundays,2,Fri May 8 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he usually calls himself a dumb cunt or otherwise acknowledges his lack of information, regardless of what he's talking about, so it just was kind of off-putting this time."
BillBurr,35626u,BillFireCrotchWalton,1 point,Fri May 8 02:22:45 2015 UTC,lol Bill is going to have a fucking shit fit now that Brady is going to be suspended.
BillBurr,35626u,BillFireCrotchWalton,0,Sun May 10 22:39:08 2015 UTC,I don't know online there is a huge presence of people who make those assertions. As a Patriots fan living in enemy territory I hear that shit all the time. ESPNs reporting on it has been so extremely biased as well. And it really overshadowed the buildup to the Superbowl. People say the Pats reputation is tainted. Some extremists who are ignorant to the facts even call for the Pats Superbowls to be taken away from them.
BillBurr,35626u,johnyp97,1 point,Sat May 9 13:39:33 2015 UTC,"Also - talking about the game where they got caught and referencing it as a blowout isn't a good defense.  That's just the game where they got caught cheating but didn't need to.  The guy was calling himself ""the deflator"" before the season started:  In another text message sent before the season started, McNally calls himself the ""deflator"" and tells Jastremski that he needs some new shoes. Eleven days before the AFC championship game, McNally texts the equipment assistant and reminds him to have Brady autograph two footballs and to get him some shoes."
BillBurr,35626u,ThriceOnSundays,1 point,Fri May 8 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"In the report it states an employee was swapping out balls to sell for charity and to complicate the matter further he was stealing some. Do you hear this part in the media?    What is not highlighted in the text of the report is that three of the Colts’ four footballs measured by at least one official were under the required psi level What the report fails to mention is that he had already been interviewed four times and we felt the fifth request for access was excessive for a part-time game day employee who has a full-time job with another employer. The refs said they ""ran out of time"" testing the half time balls. 4 Colts balls were tested. I think all 4, maybe 3 of the 4 were measured to be below the legal limit. edit --- 3 of 4 tested were below the legal limit, and the 4th ball was just barely at 12.5 - the legal limit.   So this is why Bill talks about this shit because ignorant people saying brady lets a cunt hair out and beats the Colts so bad it makes them win the superbowl too."
BillBurr,35626u,johnyp97,0,Sat May 9 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Did you read the report? The level of ignorance and sensationalism involved with this case is ridiculous, but would you expect anything less from the media at large? Especially sports ""journalism."" The reason they called him that was he over inflated the balls at a JETS game so the officials had to let air out. There was no base line measurement to say what the PSI was before the event in question, which is the first time that's ever happened. The NFL screwed the pooch on this whole thing. So there is no way to know exactly how much PSI was lost to weather and atmospheric conditions."

BillBurr,35626u,johnyp97,1 point,Sat May 9 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think the NFL has a vested interest in making the Pats look bad.  They do have a vested interest in defending the integrity of the officials though.  There's a huge difference between filling balls to the outer limits of the PSI requirements BEFORE inspection, and deliberately tampering with balls AFTER inspection.  Unless Rodgers is doing the former, it's apples and oranges.  Anyway, the NFL and their punishments are certainly a mystery to me.  Now that Brady has his 4 game suspension we can compare to other player punishments the NFL has handed down.  Roethlisberger ultimately served a four game suspension...so now we know conspiring to deflate the footballs is roughly as bad as rape in the eyes of the NFL.  Sounds about right...."

I listen to his podcast and I have never felt that way.   Sometimes he's misinformed or doesn't know enough about a topic that he's talking about, which is fine since I don't expect him to have encyclopedic knowledge. Other times, he holds an opinion and he's able to express it well, so it's easy for people to understand his opinion and agree or disagree with it.   If it's an opinion he has that makes you think he's stupid, well, that's a little unfair if you don't even tell us what it is. I mean, it's one thing to disagree with him, but.. What did you hear him say that made you ""legitimately surprised"" and ""legitimately question his intelligence""?"

BillBurr,34ocjb,marcsmart,5,Sun May 3 18:28:07 2015 UTC,He's within top 50 on the podcast app and who knows how many more listeners he has in other places. Definitely a lot of people
BillBurr,34ocjb,jimbonics,2,Sun May 3 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's impossible to know for sure, though. I have dozens of podcasts in my BeyondPod, but I may only listen to half of the ones downloaded. The real question is how many of us actually buy from these advertisers, and how many customers justify the cost of an ad. I seriously doubt the yield is as high as these companies would want us to believe."
BillBurr,34ocjb,KenNoisewater_PHD,2,Mon May 4 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but different streamers track from their own site.   Soundcloud, for instance, shows about 20-30k listens each week for him. You know it's a LOT more across all podcast networks though."

They interview one of the guys who performed with him and he talks about how young, open-mic Bill Hicks was obviously trying to sound like another popular comedian at the time (can't remember who).

BillBurr,34izww,robbd7,1 point,Fri May 1 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Every comedian I've heard has said it's ok to try and sound like your heroes in the beginning as long as you find your own voice eventually. Don't steal material, but if you are just starting out there is no shame in taking the tone.  Richard Pryor up to Louie CK all did the same thing."
BillBurr,34izww,aselectionofcheeses,2,Tue May 5 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"Always wanted to try it. I'm the age Billy was when he started so I guess I'll have to try it soon! It's weird though, even though Bill is my favorite comedian the bits I've written out are nothing like his style at all."
BillBurr,34izww,dellett,2,Fri May 1 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"I've always been intrigued with standup and after listening to ol' Billy the melanin-speckled freckle spectacle finally got up at a couple of open mics a few weekends ago and completely bombed.

I'm like 90% sure mine was the one released because some of the tags, and tangents he went off on are different.  i know for sure one whole bit that was cut too.   maybe he chopped together the two shows then."

I felt the exact same way that writer a few weeks ago felt, that it shows an extreme amount of arrogance on Bill's behalf, not only the concept that he deserves to ask people and then experience these great places but no one else does, but then thinks that his podcast is big enough that suddenly Bill mentioning it will mean the line will be a block long every night to get in.   When you go to a good restaurant, you fucking tell people about it. Word of mouth is the most important thing in the restaurant business. And yet Bill having a mouthpiece for 50k people to learn about a place actually makes him NOT use it  Also that slumlord question was annoying as fuck. Why does it always seem like it's Bill's listeners who have, in the words of that guy ""an easy office job making fucking six figures at 30 years old with a wife and 2 kids"" I mean fuck come on"

Ol' Billy Bleary Eyes called out two, maybe three people on it and then went into a bit based on it.  comedy shows get ruined by inexperienced comedians more than anything else.  Billy Badass reversed suplex'd a screaming jackass and made the show better for it, even."

To me that denotes an embarrassment in receiving praise or at least an unwillingness to receive it so publicly... for example you'll never see him stand on stage and just take the applause he's always walking off stage by then, when he walks on stage he'll be urging the crowd to end the applause (as most performers do) to me this shows how down to earth bill is. he's not arrogant, or drunk on fame.. its what i admire about him. that and he's hilarious of course."

There are some good laughs of course cuz its billy redtits but it's more very insightful into how he views himself and his comedy and a lot of his backstory. Definitely something more for comedy nerds. Probably the best bb interview i've seen
BillBurr,336sws,archharrydeanstanton,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:59:31 2015 UTC,"Bill does the funniest version of the 'larry king game' thing KP always does, but it's at the very end. The rest of it is entertaining."

BillBurr,332pik,Wrath_Of_Aguirre,3,Sun Apr 19 04:23:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say 'better' but I did like both sets for different reasons. I'm Sorry You Feel That Way was definitely more structured but I like the free flow of his Bible Belt set. The fact that he used fresh jokes really shows his commitment to giving fresh comedy to his fans

BillBurr,326wqc,ZohanDvir,9,Sat Apr 11 04:07:28 2015 UTC,Great bit on the Thursday pod when he wanted to find out what a tween girl meant but was too scared to google it because of the FBI.

BillBurr,327opq,brainwarts,5,Sat Apr 11 08:16:03 2015 UTC,There was one a few weeks ago where the guy was saying that he felt suicidal but the podcast helped him and he wanted to send bill the shotgun shell he almost used on himself or something? Bill was a bit weirded out by it then edited that part out the podcast entirely but someone posted it on here. Could be the same person?
BillBurr,327opq,tome101,0,Sat Apr 11 08:26:45 2015 UTC,Man I don't think bill is the kind of guy you want for this. Go to a professional
BillBurr,327opq,StabbedAnus,3,Sat Apr 18 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"We're getting them professional help, I just thought that if he responded to that email I could listen to what was written and what he said in response just to have the info handy.  I've caught up to the podcast since I initially posted this. Thanks for your response."
BillBurr,327opq,StabbedAnus,0,Sat Apr 18 21:23:06 2015 UTC,Yeah but whenever he responds to questions like that he always feels out of depth keeps calling himself a dumbass

BillBurr,325b8r,parmenid3s,9,Fri Apr 10 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I think most people are Friday and sometimes Wednesday. I guess its when he got paid at his last real job 20 years ago so he just assumes that's how it is for everyone.
BillBurr,325b8r,aselectionofcheeses,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:29:18 2015 UTC,Has he really been supporting himself through stand-up for the past 20 years? How was he able to do that for the first 10 years or so?
BillBurr,325b8r,Oreotic,2,Sat Apr 11 23:48:40 2015 UTC,Probably not. He's talked about working at his dad's dentist office when he was first getting started. You also have to understand that the early 90s was kind of like a bubble for standup comedy. Comedy clubs were very popular at the time and Boston was a great scene to start out in. .
BillBurr,325b8r,aselectionofcheeses,4,Sun Apr 12 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"Ya that's always thrown me, I've never had a Thursday payday always Friday."
BillBurr,325b8r,slowsupra,3,Fri Apr 10 18:42:35 2015 UTC,It really depends. I get paid on the 15th and the last day of the month (basically bi-weekly) and I know this is fairly common for salaried positions.  I guess every/every other Thursday or Friday is pretty common too
BillBurr,325b8r,dellett,3,Fri Apr 10 23:28:26 2015 UTC,Is being paid weekly an American thing? Here in Europe you get paid monthly.
BillBurr,325b8r,Pazimov,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:28:13 2015 UTC,Yea we get paid monthly and i'm in england. But i think it still depends on the job you have because i know some people that get paid weekly

BillBurr,325b8r,sitdownstandup,3,Fri Apr 10 22:54:48 2015 UTC,"Because I've always been paid on Thursday, and everyone around me did as well."
BillBurr,325b8r,FunkMastaUno,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:07:38 2015 UTC,My wife and I both get paid on Thursday. I work for the Federal Government and my wife works for a Healthcare company. It's the first time for both of us to get paid on Thursday's and we get a paycheck a week (both are bi-weekly paychecks) so it works out almost perfectly.

BillBurr,325b8r,kentguard-69,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:56:52 2015 UTC,when our company was non union we got paid on fridays. Its construction so it was by cheque.  When we were forced to go union we had to be paid on thursdays because a person needs 24 hours to get to a bank. If not paid on thursday the pay had to be in cash on friday.

BillBurr,3269e8,ZohanDvir,3,Fri Apr 10 22:52:33 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that it depends on the size of the crowd at the venue. If it's a smaller comedy club he almost definitely hangs around for a bit, shakes hands, kisses babies, shoots the shit, gets restaurant recommendations from people, all that jazz. But if it's a big theater he might pull the ol' Billy Bail out the Backdoor.  I have seen other comedians/acts at these big theaters sell meet and greets before/after the show but I don't get the idea that Bill would do that"

It's probably a whole lot less than 50%, but I'm sure he's making a good chunk of change. Especially with it being a residency.   Source: I was a touring musician. Musician's make their money at the merchandise stand, not from the door, and I imagine it's a similar story with comedians."

BillBurr,31po9u,DrChiz,10,Tue Apr 7 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"So the three sources I quickly looked up are Soundcloud, iTunes, and YouTube.   Soundcloud   Bill's podcast has 41,294 subscribers. The ""plays"" on each episode vary wildly, with the lows around 400 and the highs around 40,000. Bill averaged 31,450 plays between March 2nd, 2015, and April 6th, 2015 based off of 9 episodes. If you don't include the latest episode on April 4th, then his average increases to 34,449. This seems to be the best archive of Bill's podcast from my quick search, with 209 total episodes- the earliest being March 19th, 2012.   Note: Soundcloud counts a play as ""a click on the play button."" It does not need an amount or % of time of a total track to be played, or for someone to finish a track to register a play.   iTunes   AFAIK iTunes doesn't really keep or show any statistics. You could probably find a rough estimate with more research based off of the ""Top X"" lists. Maybe compare PKA's popularity bar/ratings with Bill Burr's? PKA has about 1379 ratings and Bill has about 2902 ratings, both being five stars. I haven't spent much time researching things so I'm not too sure how to best tackle this.   YouTube   The two main YouTube channels I found that had full podcast episodes were the Monday Morning Podcast fan channel (still highly active) and Logan Highest Primate's fan channel (inactive for about a month). Both have an incomplete archive. The numbers here are fairly low, and since it is not an official source, probably meaningless. First channel has about 1K subs and 1K plays from March 2nd to April 3rd. The second one also uploads Opie and Anthony show clips, among other things, so the sub count wouldn't be useful. For the month of February of 2015, the show averaged 16,218 views based off of four episodes."
BillBurr,31po9u,Cloud9rc,4,Tue Apr 7 07:08:41 2015 UTC,"http://www.itunescharts.net/us/artists/podcast/bill-burr/podcasts/monday-morning-podcast/  No.42 on Top100 podcasts in US list on April 6th, and also charts pretty well in the UK, Canada, and Australia  Doesn't really directly answer your question... hard to find a solid number of listeners per week considering the amount of ways available to listen to podcasts.  Just a... pretty good amount."
BillBurr,31po9u,duphre,2,Tue Apr 7 05:52:43 2015 UTC,"A conversation I had a while ago with an ""insider"" (no, I cannot name him) is that the MMP gets around 40K listens per episode. This is an average across the major available portals, Bill's site, itunes, libsyn, ATC network etc. Since consolidating and pointing both ATC and billburr.com to Soundcloud it will be a lot easier for them to track numbers. Youtube etc is not tracked as it's not an official portal and neither are ""old"" episodes. In other words, only current episodes (3 months I think) count towards ""official"" numbers, i.e. what you can legitimately quote to advertizers."

They used to have a comedy tent outside that was incredible.  Louis CK performed in it as his show was in season one.

BillBurr,30uxfl,HankVenture1,12,Tue Mar 31 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he basically said Louis is still creating a show, and coming out with a special every year.  I think his point was that not only is he different, but Louis is still creating tons of stuff.  Here's the full video.  Edit: This is a comedy interview, where the guy brings up the Rolling Stone thing."
BillBurr,30uxfl,whatisthishere,27,Tue Mar 31 02:06:35 2015 UTC,they're both pretty busy dudes and outside of comedy don't share a lot in common. Bill being a huge sports fan and Louie is a father who spends quite a bit of time with his daughters. I think they're just doing their own things.
BillBurr,30uxfl,split_thenight,9,Tue Mar 31 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"Bill talks about Louie a lot in interviews where they call him the ""comedians comedian,"" because Louie used to be called that.  But now Lou is basically running a production company so Bill is getting that label.  He's called Louie ""The King"" before and said how he's impressed that Lou is filming, editing, writing and directing his own shit.  Like someone said, I just don't think they're all that alike.  Edit: Matter of fact: Standup Bill Burr went on Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell last night, and Bell asked him about Rolling Stone dubbing him ""The New Louis C.K.,"" which he has a few problems with. Burr says, ""I don't know why they wrote that. 'Oh, he's a balding redhead. I think they're the same thing' … I don't like how they're talking about him like he's not the king. He's the king. All I do is tell jokes. He tells jokes, puts out specials faster than I do; he's writing, acting, and directing in arguably the funniest show on TV. I just do standup in strip malls."" He adds, ""I don't like how they talk shit for me.""  http://splitsider.com/2013/11/bill-burr-responds-to-rolling-stone-calling-him-the-new-louis-c-k/  Edit 2:  Turns out we've had this discussion before - http://www.reddit.com/r/BillBurr/comments/2jlsjg/all_right_comedy_fans_lets_talk_about_this_why/"
BillBurr,30uxfl,DEDmeat,6,Tue Mar 31 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"I never noticed a problem, they were only on O&A once together, and Bill wasn't silent, he just didn't say as much as Louis.  It was hard to keep up with Louis on that show back then, I listened to an old episode last night where it was Louis and Patrice, and even Patrice couldn't keep up with him.  That is an astonishing feat to pull off.    Edit: I know Louis Ck was roommates with a lot of famous people, David Cross is a surprising one, Idk about Burr."
BillBurr,30uxfl,whatisthishere,4,Tue Mar 31 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Louie is one of my favourites. I hope they do something together, I even dreamed that Bill appeared on Louie the tv show."
BillBurr,30uxfl,whatisthishere,3,Tue Mar 31 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure why they haven't done more together, and Burr is actually probably a better actor than anyone else in that O&A/Comedy Cellar/Tough Crowd circle of friends.  I think that they have both been pretty equal stand-up wise over the years, so they wouldn't do something like go on the road together, because they are both main acts.  For the past few years Burr has lived in LA as well."
BillBurr,30uxfl,coho18,3,Tue Mar 31 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"I think at the bottom of it, it's because they both occupy the same niche  Edit: hm down votes--anyone care to explain why?"

Outside comedy they are so fucking opposite. Tbh i feel Bill actually grew so much in this last couple of years because he is kinda the anti-Louie. Not that he is against Louie, but after the fucking avalanche of nerdy/hipster heavily SJW comedians who came ""influenced"" by Louie comes out this crazy redhead talking about slamming shit about how bullying was good, woman getting shit easy and etc..."

BillBurr,30uxfl,thumbyyy,17,Tue Mar 31 00:54:34 2015 UTC,"Burr didn't turn his back on Anthony, dummy. Bill called Ant after he was fired and Ant is too scared to return his call because Bill scares him.   Also, have some God damn respect for Patrice as a comic. Ant didn't make Patrice. Patrice made Patrice and O&A was lucky to have him. You act like Ant blessed Patrice by letting him be on the show instead of the other way around. It was a mutually beneficial relationship, and fuck Opie for wasting their oxygen."

But he did invite Patrice to his house, had the memorial show, and promoted and attended the benefits. He was obviously friends with Patrice, as much as he is friends with anybody. And if you respected Patrice as a person and his comedy you would be right there defending Anthony's racist schtick and arguing against his firing. As Patrice said, it's the attempt at funny."

I thought Anthony's racist schtick was way over the top, especially the week before he was attacked. If he actually is racist I certainly don't agree with him. But he's one of the few public figures addressing a serious issue and you PC clowns just cover your ears and ignore him."

So you're eating Nature's Box?"" and then kept calling it Nature's Twat.  Then he called it out for not being healthy food, instead being junk smothered in chocolates and salts.

BillBurr,30p37i,mattcoogan11,4,Mon Mar 30 05:00:17 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/-g-Kkbx5GME?t=43s Here is a clip of him talking about it.
BillBurr,30p37i,aeshleyrose,10,Mon Mar 30 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is old news to all of you, but I was shocked to find out that his cruel father was a dentist. I guess to some people it would make sense -most people hate the dentist - but I thought it makes the guy even creepier that he was playing nice with patients all day and coming home and being a total asshole to his kids."
BillBurr,30p37i,hector92,11,Sun Mar 29 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"I think he was a nice guy in general, but treated his sons like shit (or what is shit compared to nowadays). See what I think was that there are powers that parents have over their kids to a certain extent and a lot parents abuse that power, and that's why they are called abusive parents. From what I heard from Bill, (in all fairness Ole Red Tits could be wrong) he realized that his father wasn't abusive but was very fair. I'm paraphrasing a quote here but, ""Yeah like I used to resent my dad a lot in my 20s, but the thing is that he only hit me when I deserved it. (laughs) He never hit me cause he was angry, I deserved all that shit."" So as harsh and fucked up as it was, I think Grandpa Bill was being super super harsh on his sons. And people use that Moth clip as a counter argument and I see where they are coming from. But still that's from when he was in his 20s."
BillBurr,30p37i,aeshleyrose,13,Sun Mar 29 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"Bill's talked about his dad being an asshole several times other than that one video.  He doesn't call the guy an asshole, he either says nothing or says he's a great guy, but the things Bill describes and jokes about are pretty terrible."
BillBurr,30p37i,A_Friendly_Hobbit,5,Sun Mar 29 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"That's also what I was referring to. In fact, I've never heard Bill talk about how he deserved the shit he got when he was a kid. I don't doubt it's out there, but I think it's buried under the tearful stories of getting a doll for Christmas."
BillBurr,30p37i,DinaDinaDinaBatman,4,Sun Mar 29 17:24:40 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see how the family dynamic is portrayed in F Is For Family. I know he is using his own childhood as inspiration. It may shed some light on their relationship.

BillBurr,30p37i,hector92,1 point,Mon Mar 30 08:58:10 2015 UTC,"You have to take into account his profession, the things he says on stage are going to be exaggerated, happened to someone else, or completely made up. I an not trying to imply this is definitely the case, but when working it material, you change details while trying to get the laugh. Anyway, what I mean is his father could have been a sweet guy, and the sole you hear about was a neighbor or friend's father."
BillBurr,30p37i,MrWinks,3,Mon Mar 30 05:53:37 2015 UTC,"he's talked about him often outside of his stand up.    In general, I would be a bit turned off if I found out a comedian I liked completely made up the character of his father that he talks about somewhat often.  Exaggerate and change details, sure, but to wholly fabricate a character is strange to me."

None of us can say that because we never knew him personally and the only information we got about him was from Bill. He was a real asshole to Bill sometimes but he sounds a lot better than a lot of other shitty parents I've heard about. He was probably just a person trying to be a dad the only way he knew how. He even let Bill work for him and was actually supportive of his stand up career. Kinda reminds me of my dad, except that he didn't buy me a doll for Christmas.  Ol' Billy redface turned out alright anyway. He's happily(?) married, has a great job and a nice house with a rotting basement. I'd say he's doing well."

BillBurr,305dh9,citronaughty,4,Wed Mar 25 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"It actually is really good but takes a few episodes to get going. He doesn't actually say the ""I did not knowingly lie"" line until the 4th out of 5 episodes."

BillBurr,3032th,Sideonecincy,5,Tue Mar 24 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. He mentions often that he feels like he's ripping people off if he revisits their area and plays the same material as he a.) performed the last time he was in the area or b.) has recorded as a special. Material he's tried out on Conan or the like are still fair game as that's typically in development and will be different anyhow."
BillBurr,3032th,archharrydeanstanton,6,Tue Mar 24 05:42:36 2015 UTC,"You won't see Bill touring with material you've already seen on a special/tv. He makes himself out to be a real idiot, but he churns out a pretty prolific amount of fucking great comedy. Doing nearly two hours a week with the podcasts at this point and putting together a new hour of stand up every year or two. He should give himself more credit."

When he snaps it's so entertaining to me because I don't understand it but I've also grown to expect it.

I can definitely relate to a lot of the stuff he talks about. He's one of the few people nowadays who can genuinely make me laugh. I also love the fact that he doesn't hold back...like he doesn't sugarcoat anything, even when answering fan emails/messages. I have to rein in my temper at work so listening to his material provides some relief. Kicking back after a long day with a drink in hand and listening to his podcasts definitely takes the edge off. His MeUndies jingles always get me.

That's a big guess but I think you'll find after his F is for Family show and his project with the Always Sunny guys takes off it will balloon out a lot.   Add to that the momentum he's built with his stand up, it's likely he will really hit his stride in his next couple of specials and their tours. Then the movie and TV roles will get a bit meatier, he may develop his own show (think Louie), then who knows? As popular as we think he is, in terms of the overall entertainment business and it's earning potential, he is barely past base camp. The sky's the limit at this point and I wish him all the best.  Paying off the downstairs renovations and lusting after sweet-ass German ""sleeper"" wagons will be a distant memory. He'll be driving Earth-killers, munching on deep-fried eagles and rubbing shoulders with the Illuminati inner circle soon enough."

BillBurr,2zb6jz,filolif,6,Wed Mar 18 16:13:56 2015 UTC,He does seem to smoke a lot of cigars...
BillBurr,2zb6jz,vaGrr,-1,Tue Mar 17 03:24:01 2015 UTC,Not enough though.
BillBurr,2zb6jz,A_Supreme_Gentleman,-8,Tue Mar 17 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"I know it's mean to say but I think it would be pretty ironic/funny if Bill got lung cancer due to all the cigars he smokes.   He basically treats it like a joke, sarcastically saying how he'll stop, Leonard Nimoy says to stop smoking and he just goes ""yeah man I should.. oh wait Virzi is coming I'm gonna suck em down""  Waiting on the podcast when he gets told he's been diagnosed with  lung cancer and has 6 months to live."
BillBurr,2zb6jz,dellett,4,Tue Mar 17 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"In general I don't think occasional (<1/week) cigar smoking is near as bad as daily multiple cigarette smoking for you. Obviously neither is great but normally people don't inhale cigar smoke into their lungs unless they are Fidel Castro. And given that Bill said in the excerpt from one of his early podcasts that he replayed on Thursday that he wasn't a big smoker, I don't think he's been smoking near long enough to get lung cancer, much less deserve it."
BillBurr,2zb6jz,infantinemovie5,0,Tue Mar 17 07:03:52 2015 UTC,That's nice.

Do guys really do this or was he just a fluke? Seems messy (and dangerous)."

BillBurr,2yky78,fairly_quiet,2,Tue Mar 10 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"there's a high-end clothier here where i live.  he has good stuff.  bought a couple of custom shirts from him.  they were worth it.  every quarter or so he puts on a trunk sale.  it's where his suppliers come in with a trunk and some items that they mark up/mark down and get everyone ""excited"" to be getting help with their outfits and spending cash.  it's definitely on the higher end of the cost scale but if you drop some decent cash you can get some good looking shoes for your next late night interview."
BillBurr,2yky78,ryantyrant,2,Wed Mar 11 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"I also heard about Trunk Club from the podcast and I signed up and since everything is free I went ahead and had a box delivered. The prices I got weren't exactly as high as the ones listed here, they have tiers and I asked for the cheapest tier available. Most of the shirts I got ranged from 60-90 bucks, all casual collared shirts and some t-shirts (brands like Ben Sherman and Penguin). Then the pants that they delivered were like khakis also just under 100. The jeans were stuff like True Religion and other high end brands, most of them were about 160 and I remember one pair was about 215. All in all, I added everything in my box up and if I were to keep it all it would've been $1600. Obviously, it's not intended for you to keep the whole box, I ended up just taking a pair of socks that were like 10 bucks and sending the rest back.   It was good just for me to try on stuff and see what kind of colors I liked that I wouldn't normally pick out at a mall. But at the end of the day, you're better off going to a Macy's when they have a sale and asking a salesperson to walk around with you."
BillBurr,2yky78,ViperBenedict,-4,Thu Jun 11 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, just a heads up for anyone interested in buying things. If you go to a BMW dealership, they're going to charge you $60K for a car, but you can just buy a car in the newspaper for $2K. Also, if you go to Morton's Steakhouse they're going to charge you $45 for 12 oz of beef, but you can just buy it for $6/lb at the grocer! I walked into a jewelry store the other day, and they were going to charge me $28K for a watch! Thankfully I didn't give them my credit card before walking into the shop, so I walked out and found one at Kohl's for $15.00. Who's the sucker now, Omega?!? I've used Trunk Club a couple times and think it's great if you're comparing driving your lazy flabby sack of flesh to a store and walking around for half your Saturday. If you're comparing a $100 shirt (prices guys put here are not their base prices) to the $3 rack at Old Navy, then keep rocking your $15 Performance Fleece and let it be! I doubt any of the outraged posters here will be convinced, but Trunk Club pays for stylists and shipping by (in addition to selling mid-high end stuff) NOT paying for massive adverts in GQ / other BS + NOT buying a 400,000 square foot department store in each city to be there when your wife wants to drown her sorrows. Their prices are all MSRP (no sales doe), and while I'm not buying everything ever for all of time through them, I've gotten some of my favorite new stuff from there and I wouldn't have found it myself (see stained v-necks and jorts). If the prices offend you, just stop wasting my stylist's time, stay away from steakhouses/dealerships/jewelers/anything-that's-not-Kmart-or-a-Flying-J-convenience-store."
BillBurr,2yky78,brtdud7,6,Mon Apr 27 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"That's real cute, took you a whole month to come up with that? I don't have a problem paying for higher quality shit. There's a big difference comparing a 2015 BMW to a fuckin '84 Fiero vs comparing a $400 shirt to a $20 shirt just because THE LABEL'S ITALIAN. Who gives a shit, you want to be a rube and fork out a few hundred bucks for a pair of socks, you go right on ahead and be happy with it. But don't act like just because someone doesn't want to drop half a fuckin grand on a single piece of clothing that they're some cheap fuck who whines about everything.  And no, I wasn't whining about shit being expensive (although it is), I was giving people a heads up. Don't try and shit on people cause they don't want to spend that much on just fuckin clothes, when people are just trying to eat. Trunk Club doesn't mention their prices ANYWHERE ON THEIR PAGE, there's NOTHING that alludes to any form of cost. You're just asked to slap in your credit card and address and away we go! Fuck that, people deserve a notice about that shit.  Since you enjoy them so much though, I saved you some time and now you can cut out Trunk Club, I found some shirts for you that are stylish and overpriced as fuck. Enjoy!  And don't talk shit about my butcher, they're good people."

So they want to switch things up. I got free tickets to a John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp concert. I was excited he's got some good songs right; Jack and Diane, Hurts so Good, etc. But he has decided he wants to be a different artist, he wants to reinvent himself. Most of the music he played was his new stuff which was horrible. And then when he gets around to his bread and butter, that sounds fucking horrible too, cause he plays them a totally different way. It was a waste of time, but I would've been pissed had I actually payed for the tickets.  Just thought this would be the only time that story would ever be relevant."

I started with the MMP from scratch last December, downloading from the site linked by /u/cyclenaut, which can be found using the search here. Files until the end of 2010 can be found there, but after that I had to go get one by one on Bill's site. I just noticed 03-28-2011 and 04-18-2011 were missing, so I searched for them elsewhere and what a fucking coincidence, just yesterday you posted this and linked that site, which is much easier to use than Bill's page.  Sir, I salute you. You're a fucking hero for the day. Don't get too excited, it won't last, but for now, you're my new favorite person.  Go screw."

BillBurr,2wxzki,Ihmhi,11,Wed Feb 25 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"This is actually not a bad topic, and shouldn't have been downvoted. He addresses this in response to a letter in the 2/16 podcast at around 51 minutes in and has touched on it any number of times in past podcasts. (Happen to just listened to this part). He says flat out ""I was a loser too in high school"" and talks about how when he got a gig near where he grew up he was terrified of being heckled by his high school classmates. Then he goes on to talk about how he made the transition from someone who didn't fit in where he was at to moving to boston to pretty much how he got to where he is today. It's a pretty interesting inspirational story for anyone having a rough time in high school wondering if it gets better. And nobody is saying he is a loser now you savages, just that he says he felt that way about himself before transitioning to who he is today."
BillBurr,2wxzki,JustCallMeDave,3,Sat Feb 28 20:42:41 2015 UTC,this is the best comment on here but its just going to be ignored by people trying too hard to defend their favorite comedian. hes my favorite too and I shouldnt have to say it but some of the people on here need to lighten up.
BillBurr,2wxzki,MonkeyCha0s,2,Tue Feb 24 20:09:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. I figured it would probably get a lot of kneejerk downvotes from people who don't want to hear a negative word about an artist they like.  My favorite comedian too. And the fact that he started out as the runt of the litter (and owns it) and is now building toward a place at the head of the pack is really inspiring.

BillBurr,2wxzki,Schrodingers_Moose,3,Tue Feb 24 11:38:01 2015 UTC,When you become a comedian a lot of the things you mention become much easier to obtain as you are much more social. Comedians are natural people pleasers (at least when they are younger) and they get better and better at it.  What might have been awkward or annoying in school could evolve into funny and insightful as he got better.  I think Bill would say during that period it was a lot different than you paint it.  I found this blog post he made back in the day blog post he made in 2008 about his life during those times.
BillBurr,2wxzki,Yokogake,2,Thu Feb 26 08:37:37 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring to himself being a loser because he was fucking around and not taking anything seriously. Like he said in the most recent podcast, he had a job, worked out a lot, and had friends but he was also making dumb choices and wasn't helping his future. I think that's bill's definition of a loser"
BillBurr,2wxzki,TheImmaculateBukkake,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"Well he also associated with the other 'losers' in that warehouse job he talks about now and again, that while he has really fond memories of it and they were some of the funniest people he's ever met - they were all still a bunch of misfits and go-nowheres. So maybe he identified with that until he left.  I'm not sure of his life's timeline, but maybe when he left that job is when he worked at the dentist's office and started to feel a bit more mature.  Then again, not too long after that he started the comedy circuit and from what I remember, ""partied and fucked around for a few years again"" - but I guess at least semi-chasing his dream."

BillBurr,2wx6ur,sitdownstandup,4,Tue Feb 24 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"Don't use your employers bandwidth for non-work stuff?  Most people don't love their corporate overlords enough to agree with you.  People do what they need to do to get through their day in the cubicle.  Also, when you're calling someone dumb, use a comma where appropriate.  Where do you work that a 20mb audio file will cause problems to the network?"

BillBurr,2widnt,brtdud7,7,Fri Feb 20 03:37:23 2015 UTC,The podcast really hit its stride in 2009 and 2010.  I've been relistening to some of those and they're definitely worth checking out.  Those are funnier than his current stuff in my opinion (not that I think his recent podcasts suck of course).  Edit:  This link has almost all of the podcasts from 2007-late 2011
BillBurr,2widnt,HongManChoi,11,Fri Feb 20 06:22:13 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you and I think it's because Billy Boy's mellowed out in recent years and views the podcast more as his own means of release and a creative outlet. The early podcasts you could catch Billy ragging on himself for not being funny and I think he was always trying to bring it in hopes of getting more fans. Billy Redballs can afford helicopter lessons at this point so now he does it more as a way to keep in contact with current fans and for himself rather than to recruit more of us.  The awesome part is that Bilbo has done it for so long but still loves it. I don't know where the fuck I'd be if it ever ended.
BillBurr,2widnt,knotswag,5,Fri Feb 20 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"I think another part of it is that he had a lot less going on back then.  These days it seems like he's pretty busy with world tours and all his acting stuff.  Don't get me wrong, it's awesome that he's becoming so successful, he certainly deserves it, but it does make the podcast suffer a bit."
BillBurr,2widnt,HongManChoi,2,Fri Feb 20 14:47:21 2015 UTC,"Haha for a couple of years i selfishly hoped he wouldn't get bigger (at least acting wise) so it didn't cut into the podcast. But I'm glad for the ol red cunt, gettin his dues and shit!"

I also started on (late) December. I'm currently listening to early 2011 (3 and a half years in two months, I'm a psycho!) and it's awesome the see the things as it grows.  Also a useful tip: watch the specials as he mentions a new one is out. It will give you a completely new perspective of each and every joke, as you basically listened to part of the creative process on the podcasts, and how those 50 minute rants turn into 2 minute bits for his shows."

BillBurr,2wfti1,cajunbander,3,Fri Feb 20 12:27:45 2015 UTC,"Scott Tenorman:       In his first appearance during ""Scott Tenorman Must Die"", Scott is established quickly as a manipulative high school freshman, who unwisely chooses Cartman as his target, and ends up paying a heavy price. When he first encountered Cartman, Scott tricked him by selling him his pubic hair for ten dollars, claiming that this meant Cartman had reached maturity. There was no financial motive for this, as Scott himself explains that his parents give him a hefty allowance. Instead Scott was just being cruel to a fourth grader for the sake of it. Cartman soon learned he had been tricked and resolved to get his money back at all costs. However, Scott cheated him out of an additional $6.12, culminating in Scott making Cartman beg for his money back, then burning it in front of him. After more basic revenge plans failed and after being further humiliated by Scott with the public display of a video of Cartman begging for his money back by oinking like a pig, Cartman finally had enough. He devised an elaborate plan to have Scott's parents killed, then he ground the bodies into a chili, and fed them to an unaware Scott, who became traumatized. At that time, Scott gets mocked by his favorite band, Radiohead, for being a ""crybaby"", unaware that he is crying over his parents' demise.

From what I understand, Bill tried to reach out to Anthony a few times after the firing, but Anthony denied. He said on his show that Bill had called him a few times but that he didn't feel like calling him back because he ""pretty much knew what Bill would say"", probably referring to the bouts they've had before over Anthony's racism, which I thought was a bit unfair towards Bill. I'm sure he only meant to provide some support to his friend, but you never know I suppose.. Still, I thought it was a bit odd that Bill didn't invite Anthony to the Patrice benefit, I mean Anthony and Patrice were really good friends, and I felt like it was a bit weird that they didn't invite him."

Fuckin Thursday my appendix burst and had emergency surgery and have been bed ridden ever since so I couldn't make it. Gave the tickets away to my friends and they said it was the best show they've ever seen. I'm not bitter I missed it because I'll go next year and just happy I could help Patrice's family because Patrice has saved me from untold heart ache from women.

BillBurr,2voq3h,MonkeyCha0s,2,Fri Feb 13 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"oh wow this explains the Mercedes in the podcast description. ""Bill rambles about his trip to Asia, leather pants and women named Mercedes"" I was waiting for the thing on Mercedes and it just never came in the shortened version.  with that said and as funny as it turned out i think i can see why he got rid of it. either too dark or maybe got upset with the guy who arranges his emails (Andrew?) because the email implied Burr was on the same level as Pryor, Carlin, and Kinison which i personally agree with but maybe Bill doesnt.   as for the story about ""Capri"" that was probably collateral damage so that he can get that good edit to combine the sighs from 55:26 and 1:05:49."

BillBurr,2vibke,jutct,3,Wed Feb 11 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Thing is he's pitched a few shows to CC, and they haven't picked any of them up.  He's one of the best comedians out there, his podcast is in the top 25 of all podcasts.  How does CC not give this dude a show?  Their loss is Netflix's gain."
BillBurr,2vibke,bretstar,1 point,Thu Feb 12 02:23:25 2015 UTC,It depends on what he pitched. He could have been pitching crap or been asked to make huge compromises that would have made it crap  Only thing that is worse than no show at all is Bill getting a 1 season shit show

BillBurr,2uh47w,dochattan,4,Mon Feb 2 10:37:08 2015 UTC,That catch was pretty damn good. But that pass.. not even Seattle's 'loudest fans ever' could mask that fuck up. I look forward to Bill's take and I'm an Aussie that only watches one game a year (the Superbowl).

BillBurr,2uhmrx,DaZese420,2,Mon Feb 2 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but as a die-hard Pats fan like Bill is, I honestly can't think of anything worse than missing your team win the Super Bowl in arguably the most exciting championship game in NFL history, all because of a poorly planned itinerary. To learn of the game's outcome from a bunch of tweets after obsessively following your team for months also has to be a huge kick in the nuts (although to be fair, I'm not sure why he didn't just block out all social media ties until he finished watching the game).   I've actually experienced something similar to this, although in my case, the outcome was very different (I missed my Boston Red Sox' heartbreaking, extra-innings loss to the Yankees during Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS). While I would have preferred watching it live, I almost felt a sense of relief knowing that I had been spared from experiencing such a soul-crushing defeat. I imagine Bill might have felt the same way had the Seahawks eked out the win."

All the promo's in Australia are still the American promos so for months I saw all the Diaz v silva promos saying 31st January, and because I didn't think I didn't piece together that I'd be watching it broadcast live on 1st feb all I kept thinking was today I'm watching the fights and the fights are on on the 31st so bill burr is tonight"

BillBurr,2ui7gj,CloudSorrow,2,Mon Feb 2 10:42:46 2015 UTC,I saw him a week ago and there were no bits from previous specials. He does talk about things from previous podcast episodes that you might remember.    I was surprised that he talked to the crowd as much he did because he never does in his specials. But I suppose for specials he has a really tight 60-70 minutes that he's perfected
BillBurr,2ui7gj,largedave,2,Mon Feb 2 11:22:17 2015 UTC,"the only thing that was sort of repeated was the concept for the motels and the idea of driving past and people are just inside lieing down.

The end of his bits were as good as most other comedians closing bits. I didn't watch his latest special in case he used some of that material and was looking forward to ""the helicopter bit"" which I've heard other comedians mention. I'll watch it now but god damn if he didn't use that old material he must be killing it because this show was really polished."
BillBurr,2uenaz,YASATTACK,2,Sun Feb 1 15:23:12 2015 UTC,AFAIK Bill completely retires his material once he's documented it by way of a special. So I think this was all new shit.   Somebody correct me on that if I' wrong..
BillBurr,2uenaz,In_the_flesh96,2,Sun Feb 1 15:33:06 2015 UTC,That is what I assumed as well but hearing a joke for the first time in a theatre is better than hearing it elsewhere. I also didn't expect him to have such a solid brand new hour 2 months after his latest special came out.
BillBurr,2uenaz,YASATTACK,3,Sun Feb 1 15:44:28 2015 UTC,Definitely agree.   And I also really underestimated Bill's ability to build a brand new hour so quickly. He never seemed to really have a part that wasn't doing well. I guess that's the kind of ability you develop after almost 25 years of doing it.

BillBurr,2uenaz,Bezowski,2,Sat Feb 7 11:08:17 2015 UTC,"I was at the 7pm show tonight and of course he absolutely killed. Big ups to his opening acts too - they really set the bar high right out of the gate.  I'm still thinking about his interaction with that girl that boo'd him. I would have wanted to just crawl into a little hole and hide away if ol' 'Billy no belt' (lol) came at me like that. It was brilliant. I was also sitting directly behind the guys who kept yelling funny shit out to Bill whenever he asked the crowd a question. Seemed like cool guys.  I've been a fan of this guy for years now and it was incredible to finally see him in person. I guess that's all I wanted to say...So all in all it was a pretty great night.  And as always, GFY."
BillBurr,2uenaz,In_the_flesh96,2,Sun Feb 1 15:13:49 2015 UTC,"Aww man you sound like you had a super time, the 9:30pm folks seemed a little shy when old Billy boy asked them a question.   Did the crowd have any lady hecklers when he brought up the sandwich thing at your show?"
BillBurr,2uenaz,In_the_flesh96,1 point,Sun Feb 1 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yeeeeep. I'd been hanging around to see him for a long time and for obv reasons he just doesn't get down here often.   7pm show was loud as hell. He absolutely blew the roof off of the building when he was introduced (probably the biggest cheer of the night, atleast if IIRC...I was a few beers in so who knows). There were always plenty of people yelling out stuff when he asked a question, it so happened that the guys in front of me were the ones that Bill answered just about every time.  Yep, you called it. The second he said ""can I give you ladies a suggestion?"" (or words to that effect) some girl right up in the front row boo'd him and Bill absolutely went off on her for a good 2-3 mins. Crowd completely ate it up too. Must suck to have a room of what 2500 people(?) all hating you for those few minutes. lol."
BillBurr,2uenaz,muppetflange,4,Sun Feb 1 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am a massive Bill Burr fan and so are you, so strap in.  I was at the early show.  It was a good show, but not great. His bits were great, but the show as a whole was not as polished as it could have been, contrary to what others may think. Yeah, that's just my opinion but it is an informed one as I have seen a lot of standup, live and otherwise.  Bill is a brilliant comedian, his performance of his material is flawless and like I said, on their own, the bits were fine, but the show as a whole was a little disjointed and he lost momentum several times. He had a stool on stage and next to his water bottle was some paper with what I can only imagine were notes. At several points in the last half of the show he kept standing over it, completely stopping his movement and running his fingers over the paper like he was trying to decide what to say next. He continued to speak but was almost verbally treading water until he figured out where to go. It was insanely frustrating to watch him do that.  I have spent years at clubs and open mic nights and that shit is more than normal in that environment as comedians try out new shit to build their bigger sets. It's normal, essential and completely expected/forgivable/tolerable. That's just how the game is played. For a very low door price and multiple acts, it still good, cheap entertainment. But, if you're one of the biggest names in world comedy, on an international tour and charging $80 a ticket, you better fucking have a polished set.   ""Hecklers"" were not an issue at all. There were none, again despite what people have said. At the 7pm show no one heckled him at all. One chick said ""boo"" during one of his bits about wanting to give women advice. Hardly a heckle! He dealt with it fucking brilliantly, promptly humiliated the fuck out of her and moved on. He told two blokes off in the front row, one for playing around with his phone (what are you doing? Live tweeting your opinion on my jokes?), and hassled another guy he thought was filming him. That's it.  I just felt that as great as he is, and as good as it was to see him, and as good as his material can be - this show was missing something crucial, the mark of a rock-solid, watertight hour. He has the goods. For fuck's sake, he dropped his old hour 7 months ago! He has all the material he needs, yet somehow it lacked a bit of flow and polish.  Maybe it has something to do with an attempt to ""customise"" or localise a little. A lot of acts do it and few pull it off well. The ones who do are the ones who either do their homework or are repeat visitors and have a handle on the culture. Bill, bless him, is shit on both counts. To be honest, I would be more than happy if people didn't even bother. Just bring your A-game, your finely honed set, forget pandering to boozed up locals. Having said that, Stanhope fucking aced it a couple of months ago and he spent the first 10 mins of the show doing a brand new bit inspired by his hatred of surfers.  I dunno, maybe Bill was having an off night. Maybe I was having an off night. FYI, if it makes you feel any better, my wife doesn't agree with me either, but I don't care, just as long as she keeps up her minimum 4 sandwiches/year quota.  Edit: Kudos to his openers. Ronny Chieng is huge in Australia right now. Watch out Yanks, I have a feeling he'll break in there soon."
BillBurr,2uenaz,Kosmo777,1 point,Sun Feb 1 16:28:39 2015 UTC,On today's podcast (2/2/15) he did mention that he was working on his new hour whilst touring Australia. I saw him in Perth and to me was pretty flawless even though he would have been jet lagged.   If he had a set list in Perth I certainly didn't notice. I saw Ronny Chieng over 12 months ago and 90% of his set was identical. His new bits were funny which was good.   Maybe being over critical makes you enjoy the show less and not just appreciating it for what it is given he has to repeat the same set night after night whilst trying to maintain a 'new' energy for the crowd.

BillBurr,2uenaz,batman1661,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:59:59 2015 UTC,Attended the 7pm show.  Was awesome and full of energy - when he came out everyone was cheering and clapping so loud I literally could not hear what he was saying on the mic.  He came out and immediately blasted the empty unallocated seats and the old looking venue. His material was hilarious (as expected) and my face was getting tired from laughing so hard.  The only downside was towards the end it felt like he was just ranting and fumbling on topics a bit. The cohesion wasn't there but hell the rants were still funny as fuck!  10/10 would definitely see him again

BillBurr,2u8h8v,jimbonics,36,Fri Jan 30 22:11:35 2015 UTC,I hope they brought a few pairs of MEUNDIES. Wouldn't wanna piss themselves in the ol' haunted house thea without that moisture grabbing comfort you can only get in MEUNDIES.      gross
BillBurr,2u8h8v,SpaceManSpifff,22,Fri Jan 30 21:23:06 2015 UTC,No more clammy clam.
BillBurr,2u8h8v,ropa66,12,Sat Jan 31 02:10:53 2015 UTC,da-doo doo.
BillBurr,2u8h8v,ededell,24,Sat Jan 31 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Nia is cute and I like it when she shows up on the podcast.  She seems really fun and they playfully bicker but you can tell they love each other.   I know it's not the popular opinion, but fuck it."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,ThriceOnSundays,13,Sat Jan 31 06:33:05 2015 UTC,I love it too. They are a lot alike. Uneducated strong opinions collide every time.
BillBurr,2u8h8v,Skw6r,9,Sat Jan 31 07:17:30 2015 UTC,"The difference, though is that Bill freely admits that he's uneducated but she tries to act like she's way smarter than him.   btw, I think Bill's much smarter than he gives himself credit for."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,deburn81,4,Sat Jan 31 12:32:10 2015 UTC,"I think he knows he's smart, but says it more often because it's funny, and to protect himself from people who won't get the joke. She's probably just amping it up."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,plymouthvoyager,4,Sat Jan 31 18:19:09 2015 UTC,Thats not the popular opinion!?

BillBurr,2u8h8v,BillFireCrotchWalton,8,Sat Jan 31 10:59:28 2015 UTC,"Nah i love it when she gets on. It's only every now and then, but some times when I'm listening to Bill I'm just thinking ""Bill, WTF shut up about this fucking ""no more"" commercial, it's been 4 podcasts in a row now."" I feel like when Nia comes on she balances him out."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,kimchi_station,7,Sat Jan 31 11:27:56 2015 UTC,"I LOVE when Bill talks about the ""No More"" commercials. I think the reason he's brought it up so much  is because they have multiple versions and they have become increasingly obnoxious."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,t1tg,3,Sat Jan 31 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"Nah. I agree. These pussies just can't handle a GOOD STAWNG WOMAN, DERE. Haha"
BillBurr,2u8h8v,FaroutIGE,28,Sat Jan 31 14:54:48 2015 UTC,Phew. I was worried this would be nothing but hate in here..
BillBurr,2u8h8v,Andre11x,9,Fri Jan 30 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"I can imagine Bill doing this entire monologue in his 'girl voice' I see where his inspiration comes from, like oh my gawddd!"
BillBurr,2u8h8v,Rfwill13,8,Sat Jan 31 00:17:04 2015 UTC,That thumbnail really does her no justice.
BillBurr,2u8h8v,nguyen_,24,Fri Jan 30 20:52:22 2015 UTC,Yeah?
BillBurr,2u8h8v,bretstar,6,Fri Jan 30 21:16:59 2015 UTC,The thumbnail makes her look like the 'ain't nobody got tome for that' broad.
BillBurr,2u8h8v,For_the_Grove,10,Sat Jan 31 09:01:00 2015 UTC,"I got curious and ran a google search to remember what she looked like and surprisingly ran into a monologue by her. I can see why billy likes her. Other than being sensible she's cute!  Good job thea, ol' freckle face."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,suction,6,Fri Jan 30 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"I hate her on the podcast, but if this is her normal personality then she's probably pretty cool.  I think she just tries too hard to keep up with Bill and be funny, and just comes off a little cunty."
BillBurr,2u8h8v,doctor_crazy,10,Fri Jan 30 23:40:06 2015 UTC,its difficult to keep up with The Freckled Cunt himself.
