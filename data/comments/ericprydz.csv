ericprydz,3e4nd4,Open_Eye_Signal,2,Tue Jul 21 23:22:38 2015 UTC,Now this would be an amazing venue to see Prydz.  That's what I consider a great intimate setting.  So jealous.
ericprydz,3e4nd4,djbayko,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Spybar to see Olander. Although saw Prydz at The Mid which was pretty intimate."
ericprydz,3e4nd4,Open_Eye_Signal,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:24:07 2015 UTC,Oh shit.  My bad.  I misunderstood the context of this thread.  I was wondering why I hadn't heard of these tour dates 😜  Videos of Prydz at The Mid made it look like there was an amazing vibe.
ericprydz,3e4nd4,djbayko,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"Haha no worries, Spybar is an awesome venue though. Saw Fehrplay play there, saw Olander play in March across the street at Sound-Bar.  Eric Prydz at The Mid this past February was the greatest night of my life."

ericprydz,3e32n4,pFlnx,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:56 2015 UTC,I asked the same question a few months ago. No answer. Someone mentioned awhile back that Jonas said they would be coming back to beatport. I hope so.
ericprydz,3e32n4,sixsixmusic,4,Tue Jul 21 16:17:04 2015 UTC,Jonas himself said they would be coming back sometime. It's been a long time though :(. I wonder if there's legal stuff going on in the background.

ericprydz,3dvuqi,djnoisebomb,8,Mon Jul 20 00:31:38 2015 UTC,I think it's Hot Since 82.  He recently released a track with the teaser sample and got a lot of shit for it.
ericprydz,3dvuqi,atticus18244fsas,2,Mon Jul 20 00:36:13 2015 UTC,"lol. this is funny to me. the only other djs I love remotely close to Eric is Hot Since 82 and Maceo Plex. I never knew that, still love Hot Since 82, hes one of the best <3"

ericprydz,3dvuqi,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:43:05 2015 UTC,I think the problem with this track is that it has like that sound of teaser but backwards or idk
ericprydz,3dvuqi,djnoisebomb,2,Mon Jul 20 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"Nah, it wasn't backwards. It had the exact same sample and Eric was kind of a douche for pointing it out since he samples a lot as well."
ericprydz,3dvuqi,coloco21,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it seems strange to call that out considering how much of his material is sampled.  Maybe the issue is simply that it was never cleared with him before release?
ericprydz,3dvuqi,stepbacktakeaim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:55 2015 UTC,Well I think Eric draws his line between playing and releasing. He'll usually try to ask to get clearance if he plans to release the track. I don't know why he didn't do it with Every Day tho.
ericprydz,3dvuqi,coloco21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe he tried on Every Day but it didn't clear?  Either way, it's ironic that one of his all-time most popular tracks isn't properly released."
ericprydz,3dvuqi,stepbacktakeaim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:01 2015 UTC,well maybe its because he let cirez out of the cage

Dropped Diamond Girl mid way through which went off. Great fucking night. He's really stepped up his craft.
ericprydz,3dwbwe,cookiemonsta122,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"He played Diamond Girl? Jesus. This SF show is about to go off, I can't wait."

ericprydz,3dwbwe,dubsndcaps,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:42 2015 UTC,What tracks did he notably play?

ericprydz,3dwbwe,LYD2Z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:51 2015 UTC,You were there too?  Loved the music.  The club was god awful though.  I kind of felt bad for JO playing such a shitty place.
ericprydz,3dwbwe,greg9683,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:51 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that he was intentionally going for more intimate shows.  Maybe the venue was on purpose?....
ericprydz,3dwbwe,LYD2Z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"I don't mind intimate.  In fact, I love intimate.  This space would make a great bar but had no business being a nightclub where to go to head music.  A few natives basically apologized for the place, said they were only there for JO, and swore there were much better places to go.  Among other things, the acoustics were dreadful, and the long hallway shape meant that only a few people could see the DJ.  Not a problem for me, since I'm tall, but it caused people to pack in like sardines at the front, which is also where the entrance and the main bar are located...very bad layout."
ericprydz,3dwbwe,greg9683,0,Tue Jul 21 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I wish he wasn't playing August 1st (Hard Summer is that day)  Edit: It's not impossible, but it is a lot of driving in one day, especially if you danced all day already, in the sun. If this was Historic Park, it's much much easier, but it's not."
ericprydz,3dwbwe,djbayko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:47 2015 UTC,Hard summer ends early 11pm so you should be able to make it exchange by 12-12:30 barring no traffic.
ericprydz,3dwbwe,evilabed23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's quite a drive. I got a hotel out there to skip the drive after dancing all day.  I miss the historic park location. If It was a one day event and I wasn't going back to Pomona it would be a bit simpler."

ericprydz,3dtf2o,jezb87,2,Sun Jul 19 09:25:30 2015 UTC,It's in the older mixes such as epic 02 brixton in 2011. http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/4271_eric-prydz-at-epic-o2-academy-brixton-united-kingdom-2011-04-02.html

ericprydz,3dquvc,atticus18244fsas,-5,Sun Jul 19 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"actually I can. Downvotes are not for disagreeing, they are there when you feel that a certain comment or topic is not relevant for the discussion. Since I'm here for Eric, I feel that Jeremy is not relevant for this sub-edit. If you are a Metallica fan, you don't want to read about Incubus 50% of the time"

ericprydz,3dquvc,SummerMadnessfi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:21 2015 UTC,"We understand someone not being into Jeremy, but downvoting every post that involves Jeremy Olander without a valid reason is absurd.  Also, Jeremy Olander, Fehrplay and anyone else related to the Pryda friends roster belongs here just as much as Prydz. There's not a lot of traffic for stuff on Eric alone so it keeps thing interesting and offers more suggestions. If you dislike Olander posts, just ignore them. I dislike videos of Eric's head cropped onto scenes from movies and tv shows but I don't blast them and downvote. I acknowledge it's related to Prydz and someone will enjoy it and continue on with my day."
ericprydz,3dquvc,djloox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"ok, I see your point. Valid reasons there. I'll stop downvoting, since I kinda related it to me too much, I guess"

ericprydz,3doj4n,DxC17,4,Fri Jul 17 23:24:56 2015 UTC,I've actually warmed up for the Third Party guys a couple of times! Afterwards we spoke about Eric's music (telling them how much of a fan I am) and they said how much they are actually influenced by his music. They absolutely love Eric!

ericprydz,3dkkfu,t3chnoshark,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"t3chno! I kind of understand where you are coming from! However, what kind of hurts me is that we are not appreciating the music in all the criticism.  Shrine (Rebel xx) was a track we all were raving about when we had only one good recording to listen to; When Eric wasn't playing it that often !!  But now that he released it, we don't care because we had good recording's to listen to?  Just consider the scenario if we had no good recording of Shrine and he had released it! Same goes for the other tracks too; Would we have reacted in the same manner?  I agree there are much better / different tracks that define Eric; his music and the label. But this is more about what once someone had said ""we are good fans and wouldn't react how deadmau5 fans did, no matter what he puts out"".  Lets just be happy that he is on a faster release cycle atleast!! Who knows we might see Space Miami or New City Gas on one of the Volumes!!  Just my two cents, no hard feelings!! I hope you understand the point! Cheer!!"

Old want the IDs that have been around for years.   But there's a 3rd group. A group that doesn't give a fuck about releases. Glad they got to experience it. Whether you've seen him live 20 times. Or just a live set. You knew something was different about his music. Experience > music.

I mean, what do you think of the Beatport Top 100 then ? Everything I released between 2012-2013 is being deleted if the similarities with other tracks from Eric are too high. If you check, it's impossible to buy the rip-off I think you all refer about, since it was deleted. Your arguments are invalid then.  I don't know why I'm always get fired for ripping only ONE track (which was since deleted and unfindable on the net), or even being hated by >80% of this sub-reddit, but I'm glad there's haters, that means I'm doing my job right.   Oh and btw, I think you know that there's tons of Pryda copy-cats in the industry.

Copying a track of someone to start making music is no problem, this is how most people start - creating something in any program that sounds similiar to something they have heared before. Your style is amazing and of course its similiar to Pryda but if you say that you are inspired by Pryda its no problem. I mean music is art and you can always be inspired by other artist. Haters & faggits are always part of that business - just ignore them and continue making your thing!   Some regards from a new fan from Germany!"

I was at EDC when he dropped this and everybody around me was in total shock.  It blew everybody away and made Tommy Trash look like a total joke trying to follow it.  Is it my favorite track of all time?  Time will only tell, but we should be rejoicing that he's releasing it as a single and saving space on the artist album and the remaining two EP's for older ID's."
ericprydz,3deeys,jiHad2017,6,Wed Jul 15 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"I think being at the festival, getting the 'feels' and all that good stuff, adds a little bias into how one perceives songs, which is fine (I'm biased towards IDs from the UMF 2015 set myself). The hype surrounding Opus really made me perceive the song more negatively and I would guess some others feel the same way (""it's an OK track""). And you are dead on about the EP space being saved now, but this was labelled Prydz from the start so hopefully it saves album space going forward."

It slowly faded as the weeks went by and I listened to it every now and then.  Still a great song IMO, but it will never be as good as when I heard it at the Circuit Grounds."
ericprydz,3deeys,Dishwallah,3,Wed Jul 15 23:27:07 2015 UTC,Lots of his tracks are very polarizing on this forum(either hate it or love it) and most people here are bigger fans of his Pryda and Cirez D releases vs. the mainstream stuff released under his name.
ericprydz,3deeys,porksandwich9113,10,Wed Jul 15 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"I always thought most people here appreciated the depth of his sound. For my thought process on what I would tell people why I enjoy the man's music, I was telling my buddy that I don't know anyone that can put out dark, grimy tones, melodic feels, and mainstream cheese with such quality and aplomb as EP."
ericprydz,3deeys,Fold0rDie,5,Wed Jul 15 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I love the old Pryda/Cirez D stuff and I love his newer stuff as well, especially this track in particular."
ericprydz,3deeys,jiHad2017,3,Wed Jul 15 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"This could still appear on the artist album too.  Generate might, as well."

ericprydz,3deeys,Fold0rDie,4,Thu Jul 16 00:40:22 2015 UTC,Beats one interview with Zane yes
ericprydz,3deeys,coloco21,0,Thu Jul 16 06:00:07 2015 UTC,"Generate is too old at this point, but Opus very well could be. Usually though it would be marketed as such.   ""Opus the brand new single from the upcoming Eric Prydz album""   I will paitently wait to see, but I doubt Liberate, Generate or Opus will be on the album. Liberate and Generate should have been an EP release together though."
ericprydz,3deeys,TheDarkDub,2,Wed Jul 15 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"Why do you say Generate is too old?  It's very common, especially for artists who don't normally release artists albums, to include older singles.  I'm not saying it will be there, but I wouldn't discount it at all.  I'd bet money Opus will be on the album."

ericprydz,3deeys,BrokeMike,4,Thu Jul 16 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"You see this in every fan base. When you have a collection of hard core fans, you're going to get a lot of the jaded/hipster attitude. I know musical taste is subjective, but as a Pryda fan, I don't know how you can deny Opus is a great piece of work. I think some of it stems from the angst people had with Pr(10)da vol I lacking older tracks that people have been salivating for."
ericprydz,3deeys,tyorke,4,Wed Jul 15 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"Hold on a minute, to dismiss legitimate criticism of this song as a hipster attitude is quite flippant. He has released plenty of other songs like generate, tether which were not exactly like his darker Pryda and they were not criticised nearly half as much as this track. People aren't criticising Opus because it's not dark enough or Pryda enough, it's because they genuinely dislike the song. No need to call those people Jaded."

ericprydz,3deeys,lolz_alot,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna go that far.  The man has been involved in some serious tracks, whether you like his style or not.  Most artists would kill small babies to have Reload and the Veldt remix on their resume, and there are several other productions of his that have become mainstays as well.  However, I did find that comment about Trash not being able to follow Prydz quite humorous.  For the record, once Prydz' set was over, I promptly exited Circuit Grounds, knowing that Tommy was up next and there were much better things to be seen."

Im trying to reign in the hate, but so much of what Eric is doing atm is infuriating. I obviously have no right to tell him what to do, so figured it was better to direct it at Tommy"

ericprydz,3deeys,licorice_straw,6,Wed Jul 15 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"I want to try and articulate why this track is so powerful to me.  Opus begins so gentle and fragile, and it’s just amazing to feel the emotions it takes you through. After gathering pace and urgency – I don’t know – it just seems to go through a spectrum of emotions. Hope, optimism, encouragement, confidence, boldness. I just listened to it a few times on loop trying to call them out. Then it really finds its stride and snowballs into this colossal, universal power.  I know this sounds pretentious, I’m just trying to see if I can see what Eric’s doing here.  Personally, I think track can resonate in lots of different was. For me, Opus tells the story of how a lot of things in life quietly gather steam. A new business. A new family. A great idea in your head. Opus could be the sound track to a lot of incredible journeys.  Am I talking bollocks?"

ericprydz,3deeys,moon_master345,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad this song evokes such emotions in you, I get the same from other tracks too. But for me this is the first track he has ever released which I said to myself ""Never do I want to hear this again"". This track just feels so immature to me. It's like a lullaby gone horribly wrong. I think it's the kind of track that belongs in a teeny bopper rave. But your not talking bollocks if you genuinely felt those. I don't know if your new to Eric Prydz but if you are I hope this leads you to explore everything he has to offer. So much of his music does not get this much love and those songs deserved so much more than what they got. Please go down the rabbit hole and get to know his older stuff. You won't regret it."
ericprydz,3deeys,Rumsies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I've followed EP for a while now – I guess I like his 'big, glittery' stuff more.  I understand it's not for everybody. It reminds me of some research on why some people love coriander (cilantro in the States) and why some people hate it. They found out that the people who don't like coriander, their brain is actually processing the taste differently. To them, it's disgusting.  I think something similar happens in music. The track that plays in your mind is different to the track that plays in my head."

ericprydz,3deeys,djbayko,5,Thu Jul 16 04:00:58 2015 UTC,I can't speak for everyone else but I think the reason that this song bothers me somewhat is just because Eric has been retweeting EVERYTHING good that anyone says about it. it's a bit annoying.
ericprydz,3deeys,Rumsies,4,Wed Jul 15 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"I think if the love this song generated was not so much, this track would not have gotten so much hate. People saying this track is better than strobe or like strobe are the kind of statements that are a little ridiculous and rub people up the wrong way. When people are rubbed up the wrong way they'll form much stronger opinions about a track. Those kind of statements are usually from a newer fan or a fan who would never listen to Cirez D or darker Pryda, and to some people those fans opinions are less valid and it rubs the longer term fans up the wrong way even more. It is annoying though but with Pryda Vol 1 he did no promotion which made me very happy. It was no bullshit, just music. What Pryda tracks on Pryda recordings were always like. No or very little promotion. So I can forgive him plugging this so much."
ericprydz,3deeys,djloox,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:42 2015 UTC,For a second I saw the word generate and instantly thought this was going to be one of those really corny YouTube comments where they combine all the artist's well known songs into some affectionate paragraph that makes barely any sense. Thank god it isn't.
ericprydz,3deeys,evilabed23,2,Thu Jul 16 01:50:25 2015 UTC,"I loved the way he promoted Vol. 1, was exactly the way I wanted him to promote it. But the fact he is just pushing out Opus so fast and promoting the hell out of it makes me think he actually just doesnt give a fuck about the Pryda 10 thing. Would also help explain what we got for Vol 1."
ericprydz,3deeys,djbayko,4,Thu Jul 16 04:20:22 2015 UTC,It's almost as if he's proud of this song and is promoting it.

ericprydz,3deeys,carmatija,0,Thu Jul 16 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"I think main thing why people dislike Opus is because it is more of a ""drop"" song, that has a big drop. And all hardcore Pryda fans are usually ones that generally dont like tracks with big drops. Pryda is one that never had tracks that everything in track is oriented about that one drop. So Opus might seem little off for Pryda because of that... and it might concern people that he might lose it inside big drop so called ""EDM"" music. I know he will never do that, he is one that separates himself from EDM and all those stuff. I feel like all this stuff he is releasing now is to get up more US audience into him and his music (his style while playing in US shows it) so when album gets out more people gets it. Difference between people that listened him since he moved to US and between people that listened him even before that produces that ""hate"" everyone are talking about. We cant lie, since he moved there he changed his playing style for US audience a bit, and thats from where Opus comes from.  Personally I like this tracks, there wasnt a single track Eric released and that I didnt like. But it isnt anything really special about it, cool to hear from time to time. And this is coming from pre 2006 Pryda fan.(call me Pryda hipster if you want :D) While for example Re-Scored Mija would be a massive and huge release for me, and no one is talking about this one. Let him release all this (lets call em) ""bombs"", and then leave all old good IDs for his album release! :)"

He fucking delivered. He stretched out the 3 hour time slot to 3 hr 40mins. He played everything I could have hoped for. All the bangers, ids, at least an hour of pounding cirez d techno. It was just insane. Words can't describe how incredible that night was.  In fact I haven't been to see anyone play since, because no one could possibly top what I witnessed that night. It's like all my years of clubbing and festivals and watching djs perform had all built me up the this pinnacle of a set which was the absolute peak of anyone and everyone before that point.

ericprydz,3deiyf,jezb87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:22:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing that story! Is there a link to listen?
ericprydz,3deiyf,The_Redmen,2,Fri Jul 17 18:51:40 2015 UTC,There is not unfortunately :( I would pay good money for a recording of it if it did exist.   It was quite unlike any of the festival sets he puts up for download. The clubs capacity was only around 1000 or so people. He really needs more than an hour or so really get into the swing of things imo.  He really showed off all 3 aliases playing around an hour in each guise...   Ahhh take me back
ericprydz,3deiyf,Hsonlarsson,5,Fri Jul 17 18:58:34 2015 UTC,Ultra 2015 at the megastructure!  First time seeing him live and it was bloody brilliant! Favorite set I've ever seen by a DJ.

ericprydz,3deiyf,Rumsies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"yes, thats the closest thing, but I just need that audio quality.. that show was fucking unbelievable. Im trying to go to Voodoo fest which has them playing on the same night I think exactly a year from that night I'm really hoping they find a way to do it again.."
ericprydz,3deiyf,carmatija,2,Thu Jul 16 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"I answered this last year and no sets have come out between then and now which have swayed my opinion (The first 20 minutes of Ultra 2015 are dope though, rest is meh) except maybe epic 3.0 but everyone knows about that, so here's a copy pasta -    Wow, so many to choose from to be honest!  His recent set from Privilege is such a journey, everything from the vocals from this track to this ID at 45 minutes and the ""shrieking orgasm ID"" later on are really something special especially when you listen to the whole thing from start to finish. The only problem with this set is the 5 minute hardwell interview that destroys the buildup to everyday, Although it is a great set, it isn't my favourite because the talking kinda ruins the flow, even though all of the individual tracks and the transitioning between them are fantastic.  His set last year from Dans Dakar, Stockholm is something amazing also. I always love any of his sets that contain his Private Remix of Pjanoo, but add in 2Night with theTwo Months Off Acappella , Pryda - One Day and all of the other Festival tracks that we have become so familiar with bundled in a 50 minute package, and this set satisfies all of my Pryda needs, especially if I am not looking to listen to something too deep and drawn out. I think this set also makes an ideal set to introduce someone to Pryda's livesets. It doesn't last 2 hours and the tracks move on fairly fast, not to mention that he plays many of his most famous mainstream tracks, so it is easy to enjoy if you aren't used to his sound. This is a set I really love also but again, I still can't say it is my favourite. I love everything about it, but for some reason or other there are other sets that I prefer more.  Although all of his Essential Mixes, particular his Creamfields Essential and his 2013 Essential are incredibly special, I think my favourite set has to be from Cafe Mambo 2006. Cafe Mambo is where Eric Prydz plays his best sets IMO. Eric Prydz himself said that he can play a totally different set there than anywhere else, and here is where I think you can hear the best Prydz, Pryda and Cirez D have to offer. Tracks like Shadows, Frankfurt and Vega rarely get played during his livesets, but they seem to appear more often during his Cafe Mambo sets. These are some of my favourite Pryda tracks which just don't get played out at festivals or clubs (understandably so) except at Cafe Mambo. This one from 2006 has great audio and I always think Pete Tongs voice adds so much to any set he speaks over. It is only 30 minutes and 5 tracks long, but each one flows so well and the set never fails to strike a chord with me. Shadows and Frankfurt are just progressive house masterpieces and Remember and 1983 work really damn well between each other also. The fact that the version of 1983 played has Yazoo situations  mixed in with it makes it all the better, and imo elevates an already fantastic track into something much much more incredible. And then there is the final track, his world famous Pink Floyd Remix, Proper Education. Not much I can say about this really, but that it is a special track and the mixing into this track from 1983 sounds so good. It rounds off a perfect set for me. The rarity of these tracks and the fact that they are almost never played live nowadays just make this set so unique. So Yeah, Cafe Mambo 2006 is definitely my favourite liveset by Eric Prydz!   I have to laugh at this, calling Pryda - Run shrieking orgasm ID... That track deserved a better name than Run, but shrieking orgasm is too far... I was listening to Cafe Mambo today again and everything I said still holds true. Most of his music just never bores me."

ericprydz,3deiyf,Rumsies,2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"Here are my favorites http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/31471_eric-prydz-at-edelfettwerk-hamburg-2011-10-07.html & http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/31494_eric-prydz-at-capitol-hannover-germany-2011-06-12.html. There are not whole set recordings just short videos , but in my opinion those two sets have all the masterpieces in them that should have been released by now. Those two sets are a real journey,so basically he played his best unreleased work in germany. Some of the tracks are released by now but back in 2011 those two set must have been pure fire, if you enjoy the ""darker side"" of prydz tracks."
ericprydz,3deiyf,PeteTongIDeal,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:03 2015 UTC,He played Meridian... god damn. Would kill for a recording of that. Also what's with Pryda - Origins popping up in a lot of tracklists when it wasn't played? My face is melting reading these tracklists though...
ericprydz,3deiyf,owls2k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"Mate I agree meridian what a piece of art. somebody at 1001tracklists fucked up and a lot of old tracks are marked as origins, coultn get more worse than taht :(.

There's a journey right there... Juletider/Glimma, a LOT of Cirez D in the middle, back to Pryda with Rotonda, Personal Jesus, and possibly the first time he dropped Generate (listen to the crowd at that part... they're going insane).  Finishing it up with his Digitalism remix, Every Day, and 2 night.  That set was engineered on the spot by a master, and it was such a rollercoaster.  So many peaks and comedowns.  Even towards the end... right when you think it's over, there's new life."

ericprydz,3dabb1,jezb87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"yeah well we can never be sure with Eric, but i think he might release Mija (Re Scored) cause he played it in the beats one mix. a mix based solely on playing individual tracks.

ericprydz,3d9gqh,LYD2Z,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:19 2015 UTC,I saw him at Rumor in Philly. It was an awesome experience. His set was 2 hours (from midnight to 2 am) but he doesn't have much control over that. It seemed like he wanted to keep playing but Philly forces clubs to close at 2 and his hands were tied.
ericprydz,3d9gqh,K-Ro,2,Tue Jul 14 17:56:13 2015 UTC,I'd be shocked if he didn't play 3 hours at most other venues.
ericprydz,3d9gqh,atticus18244fsas,2,Tue Jul 14 22:24:01 2015 UTC,I need to see him again. Please come back down under JO :(

ericprydz,3d3ssu,easy0512,5,Mon Jul 13 08:09:50 2015 UTC,I would assume he's got too much on his plate with the EPs and album to do anything this year. Volume II was supposed to be released next month and we haven't even gotten a teaser yet.

ericprydz,3cpn2h,Fold0rDie,7,Thu Jul 9 20:15:34 2015 UTC,I don't think there's anything wrong with this community.  It really could have been worse.  Why are people letting other people's opinions affect them?
ericprydz,3cpn2h,atticus18244fsas,6,Fri Jul 10 03:13:17 2015 UTC,I agree. I think most of us verbally on the internet (internally my feelings havent changed) have moved on. I also really cant see there ever being a bigger shit show on here than there was on Monday.  Also Eric didnt cope it anywhere near as bad as he could have
ericprydz,3cpn2h,evilabed23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:48:52 2015 UTC,Exactly! A community is about exchanging oppinions and not being a hype-train on something.

Could not agree more with your sentiment on Eric's music and what he chooses to do with it. The man has given this community, and music lovers as a whole, so so much. He is entitled to do what he wants with his art. Responsible criticism and critiquing is fine, but knee-jerk reactions, entitled whining and snobby ""gatekeeping"" as you say is the antithesis of what his music (and this community) is about.  That said, don't leave - this group can use sensible and passionate people like yourself, especially going forward. I think there's still a lot for all of us to collectively gain in a place like this."
ericprydz,3cpn2h,stepbacktakeaim,7,Thu Jul 9 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"I have been a fan of Erics for many, many years. I have never had a problem with him catering to the commercial crowd. He does that better then anybody else in the industry.   What I do have a problem with is saying that this volume would be for the true Pryda-fans and then release three tracks, that are so far away from the Pryda sound I feel in love with. I can't help but be dissapointed.    I do get that the tracks will released will hype the album more then the ID's I wanted but that doesn't make me like them.   No matter what it sure has to be hard for Eric to pick which tracks to release.   I'm passionated about Eric's music after following him for so long and have so many ID's that will never get released no matter how much I want them to. I get that.   (Btw, i'm still happy he released Agag on the last album)"
ericprydz,3cpn2h,Enyaisrave,2,Thu Jul 9 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"To me the drop in powerdrive is not really a drop, but eric's take on one. After the long buildup you get a release, but he does not stop there, he keeps going. He keeps pushing it higher and higher. You can really here him play it out in his 2013 essential mix. To me a drop is when you give them everything all at once, but prydz did more than that."

Oh,some people post Megaupload links,no problem for them,but when i post an link,it was deleted....strange. when i post my collection of mix from 2003-nowadays,oh that was good enough, this forum pisses me off too my friend,your not alone"
ericprydz,3cpn2h,Fold0rDie,4,Thu Jul 9 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"Bruh, the fight is over. You and bev are obviously long-time, passionate fans so there's no reason to lose a community over a non-event (last two days have been chill). You know how a rare thing it is to be a fan of Prydz among the masses of humanity so imagine how even rarer it is to find others who share the same passion. I would love to see how many Like Mike fans there are in 5 years..."
ericprydz,3cpn2h,Cougah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Mostly a lurker, but I know you are an active user. I'm not sure why you're letting a small vocal group mess with your perceptions and contributions. Everybody on the internet flip flops so hard and pitchforks everywhere. Just ignore. Whether people agree or disagree with Eric's decisions, we are all still here, and he will be releasing more music. As other people have stated, it looks like everybody is just posting lots of music now. It's awesome. There's still a lot I haven't heard. And people are posting other types of music similar to Eric's too. Pretty cool. Your post sounded kind of insulting considering you are apparently grouping us all together into the same opinion. Of course more upset people are going to post. The people not upset/happy are less likely to post. The people that post are going to get upvotes by lazy/easily influenced people. 1. We do not all have the same opinion. 2. It's good to have debate good and bad anyway. 3. Hope you don't leave. Lots to come, and I have appreciated your contributions thus far.  Edit: Also when I first viewed this on mobile, my eyes panned the wrong way, and I thought I was seeing the title of this post CREATED BY /u/ericprydz instead of /r/ericprydz forum post by you haha. I was like ""nooooooo!! Eric hates us!!"""

ericprydz,3crtqx,HDYBYZ,9,Fri Jul 10 06:55:51 2015 UTC,Don't pay any attention to this djmag top 100 shit.
ericprydz,3crtqx,cirezdyrp,2,Fri Jul 10 07:35:21 2015 UTC,"While I tend to agree, it doesn't hurt to vote and help bump up the legitimate DJs who are more deserving."
ericprydz,3crtqx,djbayko,2,Fri Jul 10 07:45:26 2015 UTC,By voting or giving them any attention you just confirm importance of the poll. That what djmag counts on. Suppose for a second that Eric comes 1st and hardwell 2nd. Would you like that? That would be far worse than Eric being in 60.   TLDR; The poll at its current form is trash altogether. Disregard.
ericprydz,3crtqx,cirezdyrp,3,Fri Jul 10 07:56:16 2015 UTC,"I just don't agree with your point of view, but that's ok.  The poll is not going anywhere.  It's success of not depending on me.  Likewise, my silent vote is not going to be what keeps it in existence.  Might as well support my favorite DJs.  And, yes, Eric completely blindsiding Tiesto/Armin/Hardwell/Garrix would be delicious.  It would never happen though, so no sense in worrying about it."

ericprydz,3crtqx,BrokeMike,2,Fri Jul 10 07:50:53 2015 UTC,"You forgot Jeremy Olander and Dhillon! And Tonja Holma should make the cut as well.     No, but seriously.. my top five would be David Guetta, Hardwell, Steve Aoki, MAKJ, and David Guetta Super Saiyon 4... all in no particular order."
ericprydz,3crtqx,bwbae,4,Fri Jul 10 20:41:52 2015 UTC,I've heard bits and pieces of this poll and it's been generally not a good thing.  It's pretty stupid to allow fans to decide the rankings when you have some DJs actually campaigning for votes. Why don't do these mooks at DJMag let other DJs and/or industry people decide?

My friends had all peaced out around the time Cirez showed up (idiots...), and they were bummed they missed this ID.  Then, this year at EDC they left Eric to go see Armin's mainstage set (idiots...) and missed Opus.  NEVER LEAVE EARLY!"
ericprydz,3cmzsc,manductor,2,Fri Jul 10 05:08:52 2015 UTC,"WHY WOULD YOU EVER LEAVE AN ERIC PRYDZ SET ""PERIOD"". You need to get new friend's asap lol. His set was already off the hook from the start, but the last 20 minutes of his set was $$$$$$$$$. My friend and I both left EDC after his set since no one else was able to compete with his set. LOL"
ericprydz,3cmzsc,HDYBYZ,5,Fri Jul 10 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"By the end of this set I felt like my legs were going to fall off.  Then he played this and suddenly I could dance some more.  Truly a joy to see live, and as far as I know he hasn't played it anywhere else yet.  Think this will be on the artist album?"

ericprydz,3cmzsc,djbayko,4,Thu Jul 9 07:16:39 2015 UTC,"People say he doesn't disproportionately play in LA/Cali than other places, but I feel like he drops more IDs per capita at Exchange than any other venue. I can't keep track of how many ID 00's there are now...keep recording my man!"

ericprydz,3ckudv,rag3fac3,2,Wed Jul 8 20:13:53 2015 UTC,There is a LOT of crossover with Joel and Eric. I've heard it from both sides.  The vs. set at Hard Day of the Dead last year was the absolute most amazing thing I have ever witnessed in my life.
ericprydz,3ckudv,rag3fac3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:27:41 2015 UTC,I would have killed to be there.  I have been into Joel for a couple years now and evolved into Eric after his performance at UMF this year.    Eric is def #1 Joel is #2 for me
ericprydz,3ckudv,rag3fac3,2,Wed Jul 8 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"I can't pick. They are both #1 for me. Living in Los Angeles, I just wish that Eric would play more club shows goddammit. Joel is always playing Vegas. Just look at the XS gigs."

I'm almost at a point where I'm over the festival gigs...so I completely agree with you on that one. I saw Eric at the Mid in Chicago, can't really put into words how amazing that day was for me. Now just need Joel to come through California..."
ericprydz,3ckudv,djbayko,2,Wed Jul 8 21:02:12 2015 UTC,I'm so over the festival scene. I've seen greatness and I can't go back to Tiesto/Garrix BS...

ericprydz,3ckudv,djbayko,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:39:24 2015 UTC,Seriously!  That fool could play every weekend in LA and sell out venues but he plays like 1 club set a year and maybe an additional club set...Makes me sad :(
ericprydz,3ckudv,TheDarkDub,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:38:07 2015 UTC,Techno Joel is really different than festival Joel too.  I love both sides of him but his festival set has been stale since DotD 2013.

The Prydz vs. Desdmau5 set was like a once in a lifetime experience (okay, maybe not, but close enough).  I was in awe the entire time.  Anyone who was at DOTD and missed that for another artist simply doesn't like progressive at all."
ericprydz,3ckudv,djbayko,3,Wed Jul 8 22:16:44 2015 UTC,Shit. I went to DotD last year and I missed Zhu's set. I am so pissed about it. I swear I will travel FAR to see ATTLAS when he does his own thing.

ericprydz,3ckudv,rag3fac3,0,Sat Jul 11 07:17:21 2015 UTC,Except that Zhu took JOs slot and should never have been there
ericprydz,3ckudv,DOWDKR01,0,Thu Jul 9 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"How do you know that?  Zhu was announced months before the event, so I don't even know how you can say that.  In any case, to each his own.  I saw both of them and am glad Zhu was after sunset.  If you're going to be mad at someone who got a time slot after JO, then it should be TJR (or maybe Pete Tong) for crying out loud."

ericprydz,3ckudv,HDYBYZ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:33 2015 UTC,Saw this when he posted it :) I saw him at UMF and became obsessed.  His set at Ultra in 2014 was the only memorable one I saw.  It was my first exposure to EDM being there and I just remember his was so unique...also his animals remix was hilarious.   Haven't listened to it in a while though! Gonna put it on :)

ericprydz,3ckfcm,jiHad2017,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:57 2015 UTC,Depends on the show/night club. An hour or 2 is standard enough. I was there last year for a week. Saw Steve Lawler in Sankeys and I think he played 90 minutes. I was there for Carl Cox's opening parting in Space and he played for 8 hours in total I think.

I don't know how long the club is open for, but I assume each of the four got 2 hours minimum or Prydz got 3 for himself (its his residency so why not)."
ericprydz,3ckfcm,Fold0rDie,2,Wed Jul 8 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"I am curious too because aren't there only four acts per Cream day basically?   No, there is a varying amount of DJs per night and there are two rooms. Eric plays on nights where there are 3-4 DJs per night on the Terrace. Amnesia isn't particularly close to residential areas either so closing time (7am) isn't enforced rigorously."
ericprydz,3ckfcm,djpeekz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"I checked on the Cream page and it appears to open at midnight and close at 6 AM, so I'd think at least 2 hours."

ericprydz,3ci1hl,theonlyfax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:03:24 2015 UTC,Do you know how this track may have gotten out?

But at the same time criticism isn't evil; how many times do you hear about people in a creative space rise to a certain echelon of fame only to be surrounded by ""yes-men"" and watch their work suffer? What matters here is the tension is high because we are all madly passionate about his music. I'd like to think Mr. Prydz is not so thin-skinned to think ""Oh if my fans dont love everything I release, then fuck them I wont relese anything after this"" as I've seen suggested.  I think one thing most of us who have been into his music for a little while can agree upon is this: eric likes to tease the fuck out of our emotions and when you're about to lose hope (or maybe have just barely lost hope) he comes through with something incredible that makes you wonder why you ever doubted him, I expect no different here."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,chillygoose,5,Tue Jul 7 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"Finally someone making some good points, take my upvote sir"

ericprydz,3cg5d5,Rumsies,11,Wed Jul 8 13:20:29 2015 UTC,"I do feel a bit for EP given the backlash. Behind the quirky retorts on Twitter I know he'll be hurting at the negativity from a lot of his core following.   But it has to be said that taking into account all that he has said about these releases (which his core following obviously followed to the letter) then the tracks selected were strange to say the least.   No worries though, looking forward to VOL. II! I'll just be replaying 'Loving You' 'til then."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,owls2k,8,Tue Jul 7 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you, it is getting a little too contentious on both sides. For people saying there are plenty of Eric defenders, the other side has equally been as bad in their attacks. I really thought Day 2 would have some people cooling down, but it's getting to the point where there's a dividing line among fans, which should not be the case for a freaking music release. No one wins with a constant bitchfest."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,Fold0rDie,3,Tue Jul 7 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Your heads in the right place, upvoted. See im surprised no one has brought up the club technical aspect of Vol 1. Where as all these mid to late 2000s pryda classics are much more listenable for fans, specifically the ones/(IDs) everyone wants. I see Vol 1 as a tool to play out for DJs. Everything under the Pryda name isnt going to be CD/Album/HardCopy Virgin Records worthy like ""Eric prydz presents pryda"" is. But, Sorry there is a raw aspect to this genre and I think a lot of you have forgotten that with this release. Sometimes I think Eric releases stuff more direct to Djs to play for the dance floor and some more directed to fans that just listen."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,marshallbritt,2,Wed Jul 8 15:38:06 2015 UTC,Nice theory. I would love to hear some of these tracks in other DJ's sets.
ericprydz,3cg5d5,Fold0rDie,6,Wed Jul 8 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm disappointed with the songs in the first release, I think it makes a ton of sense for EP. He's cashing in on the new (and old) fans that like the ""bangers"". He's letting Shrine ID and Firestone ID loose at the peak of their marketing potential. It's hard for me to disagree with his actions because I think I would've done the same thing. ""Straight to #1 on beatport"" just means he's capitalized at the right moment. I'm still excited for the remaining releases."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,Cirez_MD,2,Tue Jul 7 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, and he has a larger flock to think of now too with his two young ones so I don't think people can fault someone for providing for his family. I hope he gets his cash and I hope people get their coveted IDs, Lycka for everybody!"
ericprydz,3cg5d5,Fold0rDie,6,Tue Jul 7 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think you completely missed the point of most of the complaints. Some complain about Neuron, a few about Shrine, but it's mostly not these kinds of complaints that we express.  We're disappointed because these tracks are in nowhere representative of 10 years of Pryda. They are not what Eric has hyped us for countless times. They don't have this classic Pryda feel, they're mostly festival bangers that won't pass the test of time, so why on PR(10)DA ? It would have went okay-ish on any other random EP; but PR(10)DA was supposed to be something special. For the fans."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,coloco21,5,Tue Jul 7 17:47:52 2015 UTC,EP did a radio interview just before his EDC Vegas set in which he said that these 3 volumes were basically 'marketing' the artist album. Looking back it makes sense now as it confused me at the time.
ericprydz,3cg5d5,owls2k,0,Tue Jul 7 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"I hope so... I really hope the album has that Pryda sound we love. But these 3 volumes are making one album (called PR(10)DA) together, and the name doesn't quite fit if they just consist of relatively new tracks."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,coloco21,5,Tue Jul 7 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"we only have like 15% of the year's releases, not so quick to jump to conclusions"
ericprydz,3cg5d5,howgod,-2,Tue Jul 7 18:53:01 2015 UTC,I hope you're right... I don't have much hope for the EPs anymore but the album could be surprising
ericprydz,3cg5d5,coloco21,2,Tue Jul 7 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"he's gotta put those 80s IDs somewhere.  no point in trying to predict the timing, look how that ends up lol"
ericprydz,3cg5d5,howgod,3,Tue Jul 7 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"In some ways, I think he's afraid of putting old tracks, as I think they won't have the same impact as his new style.   Just compare ""Sol"" to ""Generate"" for example, if today ""Sol"" was about to get released, old-school Pryda fans would have to change their panties (me included), but newbies will think ""oh, it's so empty, meh"", and I think Sol is made to work with Dajae accapella so it won't see the day, more a DJ Tool I think. Maybe that's why it may include more new tracks then old-school stuff.   Still, I'm excited about the two upcoming volume and the first one is definitely a banger."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,theonlyfax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Sol was played without the accapella back in 2007, but I get your point. Tho it's Eric, he got samples from Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode and Whitney Houston...  Sol isn't that amazing imo. But you can't say that new fans would get bored of tracks like Mambo 2011 ID, Creamfields 2010 ID, GG07, Pete Tong ID, Snaz, Liam, etc. And popularity shouldn't be an antonym of quality in any way."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,coloco21,2,Tue Jul 7 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"theres really no confirmation he got clearance for the Loving You Whitney Houston bit...I happen to know Eric Jonas and Jeremy all have tracks released through Eric's labels without clearance. Sampling in electronic music is either very obvious or very discreet. Most of the time it works out but others (Every Day) not so much. I think Sol will never see a release because Third Party just released that cheesy Everyday Of My Life on Size, which they definitely got clearance for, and it would give the impression they used it first even though Sol is a decade old. I cringe at the thought of anyone saying ""Eric Prydz ripped off Third Party""..."
ericprydz,3cg5d5,lolz_alot,0,Wed Jul 8 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought Eric would have learned his lesson with Every Day being taken down.  At least Loving You is somewhat similar to Sol so I'm not that sad that Sol isn't that 3-letter track."

ericprydz,3cg5d5,coloco21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"I don't agree actually. I don't view it as negativity but as love. Deep love for the true Pryda. The ""true"" fans are all hand in hand trying to get heard by Eric; but his God complex isn't helping, thus creating tensions."

You know, that beautiful Pryda sound he was celebrating 10 yrs of. The sound, that if you had to pick one, defines him as a producer and sets him apart from all others.

ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,3,Tue Jul 7 23:49:33 2015 UTC,"If he never debuted Loving You and Neuron at EDC LV, would you be happier? Those songs could have easily been in the workings for a long time, and he just debuted them.   Nothing wrong with some bangers..."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,4,Tue Jul 7 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"Neuron is the worst track he has ever released. It gives you so much hope and then just drops into nothingness.   Loving You is still sick, nothing wrong with the track, if he had of never played it Id still feel the same way. Not part of any fans wet dreams, because we didnt know about it.  Nothing wrong with bangers like Clapham, plenty wrong when three of the four tracks are festival bangers that really dont celebrate 10yrs of Pryda in anyway. If this had of been a normal EP there wouldnt have been anywhere near as much backlash, he bought this upon himself by hyping it up the way he did"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,Artrovian,9,Tue Jul 7 14:14:24 2015 UTC,"I love you man, you get it. Just like you're saying, 3 out of the 4 tracks stand for everything that his Pryda alias and label were working against, up until his move to the US. Then something happened, his tracks got a whole lot thinner, fewer elements and melodies, his ability to perfectionize every little detail in his tracks started to fade. I don't know if it's laziness or if he's running out of ideas or if he just has to many projects going on at the same time (Cirez D, Pryda, Eric Prydz, Festivals, EPIC 3.0, etc etc etc). Something's got to give and I think it's the quality of his productions and tracks. I also think that his more recent fans don't demand the same level of his productions and he reads their amazing feedback and that's that and then the bar is set. They just want to hear that something's happening loud and clear, and that's it, just another track that's forgotten the next month. His tracks have become more focused on the ""drops"" than being epic journeys. I like the more subtle progressions, I like the melancholy Pryda (e.g. Gavioli, Ohrid ID, Melo, Bergen, Tijuana, Clapham, In my head, Genesis etc etc).They have that replayability and timelessness that only a few artists can create. I love his diversity and that's one of the main reasons that I love his music so much. His diveristy is not the problem, it's his recent drop in quality that concerns me. I think Eric should focus more on quality than quantity right now tbh. But who am I to advice him, because it seems to me that he's just in it for the money right now. Less and less good music, more bullshit and money. Go ahead and downvote me, I don't care. I just think it's sad that perhaps we never will hear some of his gems in decent quality and that this is just the start of his metamorphosis."

ericprydz,3cfcgy,cirezdyrp,3,Tue Jul 7 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"How can you agree with that man? Of course everyone has different taste, but saying that he had significant quality drop in recent years is just not true. Whats going on here is massive case of nostalgia, clinging into what he produced earlier years and made them feel good. You wan't journey? Listen to first half of the UMF 2015. It is a beautiful journey packet into 40 minutes. Not easy thing to do. Almost all songs in that first half were productions of recent years, including private edit of Every Day. In the light of this I find it very insincere when people drop such bold accusations."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:50:39 2015 UTC,"Appreciate your input. Well to answer your question, I think he made some valuable points. Imo the production quality dropped in the last couple of years, which doesnt mean that they are bad or I dont like them at all. Some of his tracks are good, but I think they cant compete with the tracks he produced before 2012.   I have listened to the umf set a couple of times, and the only two outstanding tracks in the first 40 minutes are the private edit of every day, which is a sick track a give you that, and the creamfields id, which he produced or rather played in 2011, one of my favorites.  Nobody is saying that producing or playing such sets is or was easy. How can it be insincere if I dont get feeling with the new tracks as I got with the old ones, who are you to say what I should like or not ?  Just understand that his new tracks (not talking about ALL of the new ones but most of them) IMO compared to his older tracks, are not that special and dont give me the feeling/chills I have when Im listening to a track like welcome to my house etc. If you compare the new stuff with other producers tracks, they are still way ahead."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,jayc_,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:42 2015 UTC,Straight to beatport #1... he isn't going to change a thing unfortunately
ericprydz,3cfcgy,easy0512,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"YES this exactly! Seeing him at EDC was totally incomparable to even seeing him one year prior. It seems like his tracks have less complexity and volume to them, and he's introducing bigger and bigger drops into his sets. Of his new EP, only one track truly embodies the Prydz that I've learned to love. The rest are forgettable and don't have that same Prydz attention to detail that he puts into all his other productions. I've been saying this to everybody that he's been slowly changing his sound since his move to the US. As much as I love him, he's not perfect, and unfortunately it seems he's let me and a lot of his fans down with this ""dilution"" of his sound."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,coloco21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"Genesis, Evouh, Annexet are all so much more complex than anything he has done recently. It saddens me to realize that but this is where we are right now. Some people just say that his music is evolving, but it's more than that. It is objectively decreasing in quality, focusing more on big drops, etc. But it's Eric, and Eric can't take criticism for shit because of his God complex. So I'm kinda lost now, thinking he should be aware of that issue, but on the other hand I know he won't give a fuck and continue in that way. I'm not buying Volume 2 either way."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,3,Tue Jul 7 16:03:32 2015 UTC,Vol 2 and 3 will be legit. Its 2016 and beyond that is the issue
ericprydz,3cfcgy,marshallbritt,0,Tue Jul 7 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like so much of that hype was mis-perceived. It is a Pryda fan's wet dream IN GENERAL. He's releasing 3 EPs and an LP. That's a wet dream, regardless of content. He spoke of celebrating the 10 year anniversary, but I never remember any specific quotes that state ""THESE WILL BE 10 YEAR OLD TRACKS."" They aren't, so face the music ;)  If you do some deductive analysis, you can assume Tromb and Opus will be on one of the next EPs. If that's the case, I can't think of many NEWER IDs that may be on there. At that point I'd expect and hope that the remaining 6 would be older to your satisfaction."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,sixsixmusic,7,Tue Jul 7 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"mmm, yeah he did say it would be productions he has made spanning from 2004-2014"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,djbayko,4,Tue Jul 7 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Opus will be on the Prydz album, not Pryda 10."

ericprydz,3cfcgy,marshallbritt,2,Tue Jul 7 18:30:40 2015 UTC,He was speaking of wet dream when asked about the content actually...
ericprydz,3cfcgy,coloco21,0,Tue Jul 7 14:51:29 2015 UTC,I am thinking of something from a year ago not the edc NY sirus XM pre set interview
ericprydz,3cfcgy,noamychomy,5,Tue Jul 7 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"A year ago, he posted a paper with the tracks he would choose from. 2 months ago, he announced the EPs and said it was to celebrate 10 years of Pryda. He also said in the interview that the tracks are a Pryda fan's wet dream.  NO ONE has considered that Shrine could be in there. And rightly so. This was an EP for the new fans but not much more. And definitely a bad track selection to celebrate the label."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,marshallbritt,3,Tue Jul 7 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, his selection was subpar at best for this EP considering that there are only 8 tracks left to be released and I had hoped for far more than 12 different ID's that I wanted / thought would be released."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,Otsel7,0,Tue Jul 7 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing new fans// NEW FANS!!//    new fans.. dont know Eric as pryda/cirez d as much as they know him as ERIC PRYDZ, especially here in the USA. Also if you are a new PRYDA fan there is no wet dream for these Volumes, because you havent been around to appreciate the catalog as long as many of us have. What is a new Pryda fan anyways? someone who saw Eric at a festival as ""eric prydz"" or a club show in the last year and happen to stumble on beatport to find out he releases everything under ""pryda recordings""? Or that Beatport was originally intended for DJs. And that Vol 1 may have been just for that, tracks to be played in the club."

ericprydz,3cfcgy,sunburst09,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"I always thought the artist album would be more cheesy, didnt really care tho because we were getting 12 Pryda bombs before that. How wrong was I"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,0,Tue Jul 7 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"Ok evilabed23/ jamie orlando/ fuckface69, whatever you're calling yourself this week. Call on me had lyrics, Every day had lyrics, Liberate had lyrics, and ready? Wait for it...SO DID GENERATE! Crazy right?? The common denominator here is that he's never going to stop making those, it could be argued that THOSE are his origins (technically, Eric Prydz was before Pryda/Cirez). I want the quality (including that entire bunch you just listed) just as much as you do but we can't tell someone how to go about their life/career. My only advice to you is grow up, because when he delivers and you do finally get what you want, what will you find to complain about then?"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,airplaneq,4,Tue Jul 7 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"Generate never should have had lyrics, Aragon Id was beautiful on its own.  My problem isn't with those two tracks per se. Yes, he's always released tracks with lyrics, but hes also always had some balance. Right now this year he has released 2 Eric Prydz tracks (1 original and a remix, both new levels of cheese for him if u ignore call on me) and Vol 1. 3 festival bangers, 2 sing alongs, and loving you. Thats not the usual balance we see from eric, not even close. He called 2015 the year of the mouse,  but I doubt we'll get any proper Cirez. Pryda 10 was suppose to celebrate 10 yrs of Pryda, and he throws on three tracks that would look out of place on any pryda release. Yeh sure he can do what the fuck he wants, doesn't mean we are going to like it and keep arse kissing him for it.  Sorry I didn't align all my Internet profiles up for u"

ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,4,Tue Jul 7 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"The thing is I completely agree with you on everything you've said, but there's clearly a motive behind what he's doing and I for one trust him. The guy has gone into his own pocket to make sure the Epic shows are special for us, who's to say he shouldn't further expose his brand to capitalize on his talent? Garrix amassed 14 mil in a 12 month span, Tiesto continues to rack in millions and he doesn't even do anything. I truly believe Eric will take care of us but there is a bigger picture and he of all people deserves it."
ericprydz,3cfcgy,evilabed23,2,Wed Jul 8 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"Eric's phobia of flying imo really holds him back, not there is anything he can do about it. I obviously dont feel any differently about the guy because of it. Touring for him is just such a massive effort. I think he only played 50-60 shows last year, which is a lot less than any other dj (EDM or underground).  No problem with him capitalizing on his talents, I just dont feel that he can do that without changing who he is too much. Garrix and Tiesto will always be more popular because of the style they ""make"". No problem with Eric continuing to flirt with both sides of dance, just dont see the average casual dance fan ever being into his style of long-ass builds and incredibly slick mixing. I hope Im wrong. I mean his fan base will continue to grow as people filter down, but he'll never be at the earning level of those guys.  Vol 2 will deliver big time, I know it"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,PeteTongIDeal,3,Wed Jul 8 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"Also I will complain about nothing, psyched for vol 2. Spent far more time in my life loving what Eric does than I have hating. Only really the past 5 days I've been down on him hard"
ericprydz,3cfcgy,sunburst09,2,Tue Jul 7 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"You make some obvious points about the lyrics and prydz was there first, but calling people names doesnt make you a grew up either ?

ericprydz,3caic1,mistercrinkles,12,Mon Jul 6 12:32:12 2015 UTC,It's not about them being bad tracks it's more about we being told that this is going to be hardcore pryda fans wet dream and then releasing tracks that he's been playing for only a few months(except firestone). Everyone was hoping for those old golden tracks so i can understand where the disappointment comes from.

ericprydz,3caic1,marshallbritt,5,Mon Jul 6 11:32:12 2015 UTC,"listen, theres gonna be 12 twelve releases. Just because Eric has been playing these lately does not mean these are new productions. I wouldnt doubt that these have been sitting in his HD for... awhile... (Plays them out live, Tests them, the tracks get final mixes, then releases."
ericprydz,3caic1,coloco21,2,Mon Jul 6 14:11:30 2015 UTC,He said they're not from 2015 but I find it weird that he'd only play out Neuron and Loving you 2/3 times before release.
ericprydz,3caic1,djbayko,3,Mon Jul 6 14:37:37 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about his statement from a while back that all the EP songs would be productions from 2014 back?  Yeah, I bet he forgot about that or changed his mind.  There is no way he waited 6 months to play those live."
ericprydz,3caic1,coloco21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"""a while back"" being 2 months ago.  And he told me on Twitter that they're not from 2015. So perhaps he waited."
ericprydz,3caic1,marshallbritt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:17:00 2015 UTC,I am beginning to think that facebook post with the PR(10)DA tracklist paper he wrote was before he decided on an Artist Album too. He's just pulling stuff. I dont think these songs in VOL I are new and I dont think they are old. I just think all these tracks were started years ago and never finished. I can make a 3 min track today in logic and not finish it and mix it till 2020 but it still from 2015..
ericprydz,3caic1,djbayko,7,Mon Jul 6 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"Possible, but I disagree.  These tracks have much too catchy hooks for them to be just sitting there.  I think these are recent productions he's excited about...maybe so excited that he forgot about his 2014 promise."
ericprydz,3caic1,marshallbritt,3,Mon Jul 6 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Hm, thats a good thought. SixSix said in the other Vol.I. thread, that its probably on a earlier to past trend. 2014-2004.. I know thats what everyone is hoping. I dont think he forgot about the structure. Its Vol.I.  I'm sure him and his management figured from the fan majority perspective to release the ""big tracks"" or the ones he has been playing recently first. And what i mean by big is these tracks sound Huge in the clubs/festivals. Then, taper off for the next Vols. But from a business and branding side I can see why these were released first. Not exactly what I wanted to see, but i think hes still trying to decide on the older stuff and what to release honestly. But dont hold me to the other VOLs to not have huge tracks cause im sure they could."
ericprydz,3caic1,marshallbritt,4,Mon Jul 6 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"To test them, make sure the mixes are right and to tweak. Neuron & loving you were probably just long ideas in his production software. Just polished them off recently."

Been saying for a long time on here they wouldn't be, because they are not real techno. If you have ANY argument stating otherwise, perhaps you should go listen to Bauerpost, Thunderstuck, or the Tumble then tell me Shrine (bonafide prog with tension and release) is techno. In 2015 alone, I've seen Solomun, Eats Everything, Joris Voorn, and Nic faniculli play On/Off. Why? because THAT is techno. None of them would be caught dead playing shrine or Firestone. He cannot keep mis-classifying Cirez tracks to please fans that think they are capable of making that decision."
ericprydz,3caic1,djbayko,6,Mon Jul 6 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was funny that people ascribed Prydz / Pryda / Cirez labels to IDs, as if they know what serif is thinking.  The Pryda sound has obviously evolved since 2013.  Not a big deal."
ericprydz,3caic1,sunburst09,3,Mon Jul 6 16:11:49 2015 UTC,PREACH! I'm not sure people understand that just because a track has a techno kick doesn't mean it's techno. For the last 3 years big room and electro have been using hardstyle kicks and aren't classified as hardstyle
ericprydz,3caic1,noamychomy,-2,Mon Jul 6 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"Total disappointment on from my end.  Not that I don't think they're well produced tracks but the only one I actually love is (ironically) Loving You. I expected this to be filled with old ID's that made me love Pryda in the first place.  I'm also very butthurt that we didn't get Sol after that three dot hint.  Vol II better be classics, Eric!"
ericprydz,3caic1,TheDarkDub,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think that Eric may release these by giving now the new bangers then after that some newer more pryda'ish tracks like epic radio 006 id, taxi id, new city gas id etc. And then the last ep is going to be tracks from 2004-2010, saving the best for the last (or album)."
ericprydz,3caic1,djbayko,-3,Mon Jul 6 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to final version of Shrine and Firestone. They are two awesome tracks, and I can't wait to hear the full quality versions.   As far as what he is doing, he is appealing to a more commercial, festival style sound.

Progressive has been doing okay, and I know of quite a bit I don't mind.   Techno is the only strong genre for me right now."

ericprydz,3caic1,TheDarkDub,0,Tue Jul 7 00:46:07 2015 UTC,Wonder what made him release Rebel XX as Pryda. I like Cirez D - Shrine better
ericprydz,3caic1,TheDarkDub,6,Mon Jul 6 15:57:22 2015 UTC,Because it isn't Techno.

ericprydz,3cb897,marshallbritt,9,Mon Jul 6 15:54:31 2015 UTC,I think negativity would hurt us more than anything. Like ive said in other threads he doesnt have to release anything. Keep pushing on him he may not release anything again.

ericprydz,3cdt03,mistercrinkles,2,Tue Jul 7 14:47:49 2015 UTC,It is an honor.  Also If SW4 and Power Drive are Pryda tracks I have no idea how you all didn't see it coming.
ericprydz,3cdt03,moon_master345,5,Tue Jul 7 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"The tracks he released yesterday would have been fine on some random EP, that's the point.

ericprydz,3cdt03,coloco21,2,Tue Jul 7 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Shrine and Firestone were in no way, shape or form on my list. I like most else thought these were Cirez tracks. Loving you and Neuron don't surprise me, since they were JUST debuted. I was expecting to see EDC NY ID (Tromb) and MK ID for sure. Perhaps on Vol 2."
ericprydz,3cdt03,mistercrinkles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you see Run(Firestone) as Cirez D guys. That's so ""electrish"" and it's not even dark or something, it could be on an old SHM set.    And Rebel XX (Shrine ID) basseline is typically Pryda. Look at that: RENE. So the first time I heard Shrine it reminded me the old times in 2007.    I just hope on the next EP's there is going to be some tracks between 2004 and 2008. I know there it many fans post 2012. But that period was the most inspirational tracks and atypic, specially between 2006 and 2008."
ericprydz,3cb2dh,ril3ydx,3,Mon Jul 6 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"The whole track is just massive. Maybe I'm overly partial to it cuz I've watched it performed live 4-5 times. Its def got a sentimentality to me. Its my favorite on the EP, although Loving You is probably the best track."
ericprydz,3cb2dh,mistercrinkles,2,Mon Jul 6 21:44:37 2015 UTC,The one good thing from the festival rips is hearing the crowd lose their shit when it drops...feels like I'm back at the ASOT stage

I came here to my favorite subreddit to share my enthusiasm, but was met with a torrent of hate and negative energy. I understand youre upset but dont rain on my parade. Just yesterday all of you were praising the man and now youre acting like he switched over to big room house or something. Theres 2 more EPs coming and an album. I get the frustration, but dont ruin this moment for others."

ericprydz,3caibg,marshallbritt,9,Mon Jul 6 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a longtime veteran and the EP is just fine.  If this was released in January, a month after Shrine ID's first play and before the Generate tour, people would have shit themselves in joy.  Some people don't like the fact that Eric's sound seems to be evolving, but I love it.  Stagnancy would make for a pretty boring artist.  Also, there are still 2 EPs and an album left - that's like ~18 songs.  Save your outrage!  Being upset about the Pryda / Cirez D pseudonym is nuts.  They honestly could have gone either way, and I laughed when people debated it like they KNOW what is in Eric's head.  Sure, they have a darker feel than Pryda but are not techno like traditional Cirez D tracks.  I was in the Pryda camp."
ericprydz,3caibg,djbayko,2,Mon Jul 6 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"Upvoted. The Cirez D/Pryda naming stuff seems really nit-picky.

ericprydz,3caibg,sixsixmusic,4,Mon Jul 6 12:30:13 2015 UTC,What about Firestone tho ? No one would have said Pryda
ericprydz,3caibg,coloco21,2,Mon Jul 6 12:32:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think firestone hits like a pryda track. Anything that has a vocal hook and a big ""drop"" like that isn't Cirez. Cirez tracks are subtle, dark and mysterious. Does Firestone sound like that to you? I just honestly thought he wouldn't release it."
ericprydz,3caibg,sixsixmusic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:43:02 2015 UTC,"Why not?  Lots of people said Pryda.  These tracks fall in between IMO.  Not techno, so Pryda?  Dark feel, so Cirez?  Labelling them before Eric is the strange part."
ericprydz,3caibg,djbayko,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"How Shrine is Pryda is beyond me. After your comment I went back to listen Cirez tracks like Glow, Full Stop, Mokba to cross compare. They are so similar to Shrine in style. What am I missing?"
ericprydz,3caibg,cirezdyrp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:22:10 2015 UTC,"Are those tracks something Eric would open a major festival or nightclub set with? It's about the feel of the song and how it's used. Rebel has a ""BIG"" feeling to it. The songs you listed don't. They build gently and they don't have huge drops. Much more underground feel."
ericprydz,3caibg,sixsixmusic,9,Tue Jul 7 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"So what we thought were 2 Cirez tracks ended up being Pryda...Can't lie, a little disappointed :( wanted some older jams. Plus we have pretty good recordings of all the songs released today already."
ericprydz,3caibg,PrydaSnare,13,Mon Jul 6 11:42:49 2015 UTC,I think we actually did get 2 Cirez D tracks and Eric's just renamed them as Pryda so he can release them to his new USA fans.
ericprydz,3caibg,Otsel7,3,Mon Jul 6 11:50:13 2015 UTC,"Low Mate, Low. Rebel XX and Run are far more complex than techno structure tracks. Some one pulled the Bauerpost card today okay I get it, I am going pull the Accents/Revolutions card. Come on... Cirez D has wide/different sounding releases and so can Pryda. USA is still relatively ignorant to this style and sound, getting better, but ignorant. ""His new fans"" If you heard what else they listen to, you would shit. This is not for them. Believe me I live here."
ericprydz,3caibg,marshallbritt,4,Mon Jul 6 15:44:21 2015 UTC,Pryda - Power Drive  Pryda - Axis  Pryda - Reeperbahn  Plenty of Pryda diversity there. People should know this already.
ericprydz,3caibg,advocat3,3,Mon Jul 6 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people insist they were Cirez.  I could have seen them go either way, but they are more Pryda.  The Pryda sound has evolved recently.  Need to come to grips with that."

Even I was hoping he was going to release some older stuff that do not have a good recording anywhere, namely One Day ID.  I really hope Eric chose these tracks to attract new fans, and is not money motivated at all.  Although $10 for 4 songs is a little hard to swallow."

ericprydz,3caibg,TheDarkDub,0,Mon Jul 6 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"This is hilarious, I remember when everyone said they wouldn't act like the horde after While, and look at this.   To be surprised he released tracks he has been playing recently is hilarious. Since ASOT more and more people have been exposed to Prydz. It makes complete sense that he releases songs he has been promoting live. For casuals who saw Prydz at EDC, or Ultra they would be confused as to why Rebel XX and Run weren't released.   Just like I expect the next release to feature Trombe, New Eras, MSG ID 02 and New Gas City ID. It wouldn't make sense for him to have not played Pete Tong in years, and release it right away.   These releases are to increase exposure for his brand, so he can put on a bigger tour in the fall."
ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,3,Mon Jul 6 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"You really think its hilarious why would you ? After stating that this ep's will be every true pryda fans wet dreams come true, and getting those 4 tracks, they shouldnt be surprised at all ? Its not like he played his releases before bergen, like years before and then finally releasing them right?   Didnt he do that most of the time with his earlier releases play them like a couple of years and then putting them out, why would you be not surprised seeing tracks getting  released that he played out for weeks or a couple of months? Your 2nd point makes no sense here, if you compare it to his released work pre 2012.  Instead of new eras let him put mk id on the next ep, that would be surprising to say the least and we will see where this will leave him.  Agree with your last point."
ericprydz,3caibg,TheDarkDub,4,Mon Jul 6 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing that comment cited here. It was an interview on SirusXM before EDC LV correct?   I seem to recall him saying Liberate was created very quickly and released soon there after. I can't really comment about Pre-2012 Prydz, simply because I wasn't into Dance as much back then as I am now. I can however speak to the reasoning from Team Prydz for this release. He did it because these are the songs with the most exposure right now.   After EDC last year ""Generate"" was hot shit, and by the time he played the final version at Ultra it went straight to number 1. That was the song everyone was waiting for. Fuck he even planned his whole set around that song, to the point where it was trending #1 on twitter. I'm pretty sure the ASOT video stream kicked in for Rebel XX, so it makes complete sense to release the songs with the most exposure first.   Two to three years ago, Eric didn't have the level of exposure he does today. Eric has been playing these out lately for one of two reasons, or both.    Because he genuinely loves these tracks, and is very proud of them. Because he knew he would be releasing them, so he wanted to increase exposure.    I doubt he will get licensing for MK, it's a pretty heavy sample.   Im also willing to bet Exit 2013 ID, is going to be released as a Pryda track as well."
ericprydz,3caibg,Fold0rDie,2,Mon Jul 6 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"Upped, but hold up...he really sampled Mortal Kombat?! I thought it was just a fan joke!"
ericprydz,3caibg,evilabed23,3,Tue Jul 7 00:58:23 2015 UTC,"Yeh, I was there when ppl started to call it MK id, it was just because it reminds ppl of mortal Kombat,  there is no sample as far as I know"
ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,0,Tue Jul 7 11:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was in the edc stream right.  I see your points here and have to agree about the exposure and the timing etc., although Im still in denial about it :D. Oh good old pryda where are you ?   You could be right about exit, I mean fuck it who would have thought shrine and fire are pryda."
ericprydz,3caibg,TheDarkDub,0,Mon Jul 6 23:58:07 2015 UTC,"I'd just enjoy the ride, it could have been worse. He could have pulled a deadmau5 and tried his best Trent Reznor impersonation.   I mean we saw that he did the exact same thing with Origins. ""This one doesn't have a name yet, but I played it recently... And it went off like a bomb!"""
ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"Dont know what you mean with that deadmau5 reference.   Well there is nothing left other than live with those 4 tracks right?  Not a fan of origins either. Like I said ever since bergen or the ""forced"" rotonda release he has been putting out music that he ""just"" produced, powerdrive,liberate, mija/origins/backdraft, generate and so on, oh and the cirez d release with drums in the deep and the other track. ""Just"" is relatively ment here, meaining not older than 1 year.  He mostly says tracks go off like a bomb. I can give you an example, the set from tomorrowland was recorded last year not the whole thing but parts of it, he played old pryda tracks pete tong id, capitol id, snaz and so on, few people in the crowd were dancing, than he puts the newer stuff on and the whole crowd goes ""nuts"". If you had put old pryda fans instead of these guys there, they would have go clinic to the old pryda tracks and not so much for the new stuff maybe. So maybe you can see the point here, ""went off like a bomb"" is relatively seen."
ericprydz,3caibg,Johan_Prih,5,Tue Jul 7 00:16:10 2015 UTC,These tracks were probably released just to create more hype to next releases and PRY(10)DA.

ericprydz,3caibg,Fly_Right,7,Mon Jul 6 12:29:10 2015 UTC,Yeah... Considering the number of great ID's out there this is a pretty disappointing track list.
ericprydz,3caibg,Otsel7,-4,Mon Jul 6 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"This is not only disappointing. This is outrageous. Eric has spat in our faces this time. This is not something for us true Prydateers, this is for all his new fans over in the states. They can buy this EP, because I won't."
ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,4,Mon Jul 6 11:33:04 2015 UTC,"hate to say this but i agree with this totally. i take pride in being a old cynical ""prydateer"" but i was expecting some old gems."
ericprydz,3caibg,gtevans19,3,Mon Jul 6 11:36:56 2015 UTC,I feel like with each release and set Eric is starting to cater more and more to the mainstream audience. This track list backs this up.
ericprydz,3caibg,evilabed23,5,Mon Jul 6 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"After a great ep with bergen/recomondos, and maybe the ""forced"" release of rotonda it went downhill imo. I agree with you"

ericprydz,3caibg,PrydaSnare,4,Mon Jul 6 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"Frankly these tracks were worthy enough to be on the album, but I guess there will be at least 15 more tracks out in the next 3 months, so I'm not complaining. All these tracks are from 2014-2015, which don't fall in between the 10 year anniversary technically!"

ericprydz,3caibg,Ser_JamieLannister,20,Mon Jul 6 11:45:47 2015 UTC,"The reason shrine is disappointing is because it's not a track for the ages. It's a fun track you enjoy for a little bit but has minimal replayability. The golden pryda tracks are golden because they've stood the test of time all these years and are still amazing to hear. If you're gonna celebrate ten years of pryda and immortalize the label, shrine doesn't exactly come to mind."
ericprydz,3caibg,t3chnoshark,4,Mon Jul 6 11:48:49 2015 UTC,well put
ericprydz,3caibg,Ollie__Oxenfree,3,Mon Jul 6 13:02:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. His recent tracks lack that replayability as you say. His older tracks are timeless classics which you can listen to a hundred times and still hear something new and mesmerizing the 101st time.
ericprydz,3caibg,eatingcarbs,-1,Mon Jul 6 13:34:12 2015 UTC,We'll I guess we will never get them. It's not like another LP is coming out in a month... and then another one after that... right?
ericprydz,3caibg,t3chnoshark,7,Mon Jul 6 13:30:20 2015 UTC,Bro can you even comprehend my burning desire for the older tracks! The shrine firestone and more recent id's we already have in an acceptable quality and can listen beforehand while other older tracks like global gathering capitol and many more are in live shit cellphone quality and would do anything to hear them in better quality. Dont you understand we are burning more for those older tracks these newer tracks we havent been waiting long!!!

ericprydz,3caibg,t3chnoshark,6,Mon Jul 6 11:55:11 2015 UTC,"Okay I knew this may happen and everyone is going OFF, mates chill it. Here are somethings to scratch you eye about. First, these tracks Eric has been playing out lately are done with complete mixes and are not new to him, Eric knows how he wants them to sound and this is because he has been playing them out so recently.(VOL 1). So why not go ahead and release them get them out of the way? These other Unreleased/un-recently played Classics you all want? Im sure Eric has to dig back through the bag. Any one else a producer in here? sheesh. Tracking back through the catalog on your Mac takes time especially if you have over 400 productions/ideas sitting like Eric does (This Why PR(10)DA is already late). Releasing these 4 today buys him more time to finish/organize/wrap up the rest. Second, I guarantee these other 8 are still getting their final mixes done in the studio. I DONT CARE how many times he played them between 2004-2014, technology and his craft has become better and he is giving them final touches and maybe a renewal. Eric is a perfectionist and does what he wants. Give the Man a chance. You're going to get a few of the ones you have been waiting so many years for. * You know what? All these unreleased pryda tracks he produced while he was living in Europe way back, He is in Europe for the rest of the summer, probably going to be playing them out again.... Testing and mixing them for their final Release."
ericprydz,3caibg,SummerMadnessfi,3,Mon Jul 6 20:14:11 2015 UTC,I had a slight feeling it was the fact they aren't done yet
ericprydz,3caibg,DarkMemoria,-1,Mon Jul 6 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah Neuron is among the worst tracks he's ever produced, and now released. He has not been sitting on these tracks for years because these tracks don't sound like Pryda."

These EPs are supposed to be for the fans who have waited YEARS for the releases of their long time favorite IDs and instead we are given tracks that have mostly only been in the fold for months. Long time fans have every right to be disappointed with Vol 1, they aren't being snobs. Imagine you wait months for a car you've wanted and instead your younger sibling gets a brand new one first.

ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,3,Mon Jul 6 12:24:46 2015 UTC,"I seriously have no idea what that ""drop"" is. First time I heard it I was involved and then instant head shaking and confused look."
ericprydz,3caibg,TheSushiLegend,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:37:35 2015 UTC,Maybe some Remixer will pimp up Neuron ;)
ericprydz,3caibg,PeteTongIDeal,3,Mon Jul 6 12:54:33 2015 UTC,"Such a joke, the best thing he has released since his album was MIJA/AXIS , i litterly had goosebumps when i heard the preview for that, this is just whatever."
ericprydz,3caibg,TheSushiLegend,3,Mon Jul 6 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"I have been looking forward too PR(10)DA ever since it was first hinted at by Eric, more than a year ago, and to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.   I like many others have been anticipating the release of some of the many different ID's from the last 10 years. I would go through the wiki on this very sub and compile a list of my favourites from throughout the years, I even redid this list last week (and I know I'm not the only one here who has done so).  Now imagine how upset I become once I realise that 3 of the 4 tracks from volume 1 have been debuted in the last 6 or so months in Eric's sets. Not only that but you wouldn't be considered a fool for thinking that 2/4 of these tracks are Cirez D. I know people have their likes/dislikes but this negative feedback is fully justified IMO.   And to those who say its only Vol 1, if his Beats 1 mix is anything to go by, the hardcore  fans are in for more hurt."
ericprydz,3caibg,Enyaisrave,2,Mon Jul 6 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Mate you speak right out of my soul, take my upvote and my energy I got left from being disappointed about vol 1"
ericprydz,3caibg,Sweaty_Penguin,2,Mon Jul 6 14:49:19 2015 UTC,Wait - why would the beats 1 mix be anything to go by? You do realize that it and the CD are completely different markets right? Cool.
ericprydz,3caibg,coloco21,4,Mon Jul 6 16:19:30 2015 UTC,Pryda - Rebel XX (Formerly known as Cirez D - Shrine ID) Pryda - Run (Formerly known as Cirez D - Firestone ID) Pryda - Loving you 4.Pryda - Neuron   Please tell me that I'm dreaming because I can't hide my disappointment. Never in my wildest nightmares could I think of these 4 tracks being on PR(10)DA and least of all on the same EP...
ericprydz,3caibg,Enyaisrave,3,Mon Jul 6 19:54:34 2015 UTC,"Eric always surprises my friend, you never know with this guy. Edit: take my upvote"
ericprydz,3caibg,Sweaty_Penguin,3,Mon Jul 6 11:35:03 2015 UTC,"As a long time Prydz fan,  I think it's incredibly ironic that one of the things that drew me to Eric in the first place - unique sound, own style, not reliant on the same tracks over and over in his live sets, takes his sweet time with releasing the favourites - are what so many ""so-called"" veteran fans are actually pissed at him for today. Go ahead and judge some of us (including the older fans) for liking some of the newer tracks - you sound like the fans of (insert older band here) that hated their new songs just because it's new. ""Not me!"" you'll say. ""I just don't like the sound! It's way different than the Prydz/Pryda sound I know!"". Let's pretend that you're right for a second; like I mentioned, sound variety is one of the (many) things that drew me to Eric's music in the first place. Isn't it the same for you?   Part of the problem is likely the confusion that was caused - admittedly by Eric - in announcing these 4 releases. Just to clarify,  there are 3 releases of 4 tracks each for Pryda (12 total), and then an Eric Prydz album in October, which could hold more than 30 tracks if the Pryda CDs are any indication. For those of you getting so pissy today, don't you think - crazy thought here - that the tracks you've been waiting for will be on the next two Pryda EP's or the Eric Prydz album? Even Eric doesn't have enough new material to load up all three with recent music only.   A quick word on Neuron - to me, you can put (most of) it in the same cabinet as Leja - beautiful, melodic, progressive tracks that can take you on a musical journey for 7+ minutes. It's my favourite track from the release.  Finally, if you actually dislike today's track releases because some/all weren't released under the Cirez D banner, something's gone horribly, horribly wrong. Take a step back."
ericprydz,3caibg,cirezdyrp,3,Mon Jul 6 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"Agree with some parts of your comment, thanks for taking the time. But could you explain how you compare leja with neuron? I think neuron is an ok track, but cant hear the similiarties that you describe, since neuron has a drop, and an aggresive bassline, cant describe it that much bc Im not familiar with the musical terms here. While leja is smooth, has some kind of an 80's vibe to it, very melodic. Maybe its just me but I dont hear anything alike between neuron and leja."
ericprydz,3caibg,gtevans19,2,Mon Jul 6 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, and thanks for the thought. I agree that the drop of Neuron isn't anything like Leja, which is why I did preface the comment with a big ""(most of)"" haha. The beginning of Leja though, is deep, slow and melodic, while still fitting in the progressive house bucket. To create something like that, and have it be appealing, is incredibly tough. The beginning of Neuron did the same thing for me. Just a personal opinion."
ericprydz,3caibg,atticus18244fsas,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:14 2015 UTC,I love Eric but these four tracks are some of the worst he's ever made. Shrine ID is horrible.   He knew what tracks the real Pryda fans wanted from the old EricPrydz.tv forum.   Hmm...  There's always next Volume...
ericprydz,3caibg,gtevans19,3,Mon Jul 6 21:01:49 2015 UTC,Shrine is a Cirez Bomb track.   Firestone is fire and had to be released at some point.   Neuron - very average.   Loving you - Beautiful Pryda  He might have used this EP to get rid of some tracks he new had to get out there.
ericprydz,3caibg,joco77103,8,Mon Jul 6 12:21:36 2015 UTC,"""a Cirez bomb track"", released as Pryda, on PR(10)DA. That's everything that's wrong with this EP"
ericprydz,3caibg,evilabed23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:56:56 2015 UTC,How does Shrine ID sound anything like Cirez D? I don't understand how some of you can't hear the difference.   INOX 2009 ID 01 is the one I have a hard time with Eric labelled it as Cirez D. And maybe Fabric Test as Cirez D.
ericprydz,3caibg,eatingcarbs,0,Mon Jul 6 13:00:39 2015 UTC,We know its Cirez. We know :'(  I agree with you though. New Pryda fans wouldn't even know who Cirez D was if you asked them.
ericprydz,3caibg,cookiemonsta122,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:44:38 2015 UTC,"He might have used this EP to get rid of some tracks he new had to get out there.   Yeah, I got that feeling too. In fact this is most likely scenario. Good days to come, not that today is bad either."
ericprydz,3caibg,eatingcarbs,4,Mon Jul 6 13:08:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I completely agree with you. Loving you is the only decent track imo.
ericprydz,3caibg,cookiemonsta122,10,Mon Jul 6 13:06:33 2015 UTC,You say that like the Mija EP is bad...

ericprydz,3c8292,BrokeMike,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"I thought that the song was more presentable to a non Prydz fan with the accapella than without. I find it great because the lyrics mesh will with the ""drop"" of the song."

ericprydz,3c302u,SummerMadnessfi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:59:40 2015 UTC,There is no need for flac because it isnt streamed in that quality (nowhere near it) but yea everything else is fine
ericprydz,3c302u,t3chnoshark,3,Sun Jul 5 04:18:03 2015 UTC,"Well, here is the thing.   I capture whatever apple streams, which has been reported to be 256kbps AAC which is already a transcode.  THEN I transcode it to 320kbps MP3.  You do lose some of the fidelity with a secondary transcode, which I know some people hate.  FLAC makes it so it was exactly as it was streamed.  320MP3 does not.  The differences are in the vast majority of cases not audible. Aside from maybe some very specific ""killer"" samples, AAC ~256 kbps VBR will be transparent, i.e. audibly undistinguishable from the original source.  Alas, the less transcodes by the time it falls in your hands, the better."

Interesting that he has the Tomorrowland weekend free, wonder if he'll be make a surprise appearance.   The best thing about him being in Europe is that it usually inspires his best Pryda work, especially in Ibiza.   I'd expect him to play Cafe Mambos at least twice in Ibiza, probably from 9pm on the Amnesia dates. He did a 3 hour set there in 2013 which was sublime."

ericprydz,3bw5gj,TheDarkDub,7,Thu Jul 2 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"I just endured through that somehow. Prydz is in the episode for ~8 minutes (if you want to skip the fluff, he's in at the 4 minute mark, 22 minute mark, 34 minute mark assuming no commercials). I think he might on future episodes because the remodel wasn't finished, but the ""drama"" with his girlfriend and her office is done so who knows.  Highlights:   Bought a $5.3MM house on Mulholland  Host claims Prydz told him he got paid $500K for a NYE gig (this shocked me if true) Eric doesn't want anyone fuckin' with his studio (aka mancave) Sophie wears the pants in the Prydz household"
ericprydz,3bw5gj,Fold0rDie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:24:55 2015 UTC,"The context was that one of Jeff's quotes to do the work was $500k.  Eric whined ""That's my whole New Year's gig.""  Keep in mind that his New Year's gig was two shows - LA and SD - assuming he's talking about 2015 NYE, which seems likely because he tweeted about building a new studio last October.  $500k isn't outrageous, considering he played 2 fairly large venues at about $100 per head + concessions."

ericprydz,3bw5gj,djbayko,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're in the industry, but me and my buddy were trying to figure out how much these guys were getting paid per gig. $250K per event still seems pretty huge to me, but obviously more power to him (Epic 4.0 plz). It just makes me wonder if Calvin and others are raking in half a mill or more per show...before the bubble really pops"
ericprydz,3bw5gj,Fold0rDie,3,Thu Jul 2 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"First, NYE is going to be more of an exception to the rule.  People spend money on NYE, and everyone goes out.  But it can certainly be $100k+ per gig for the big names.  It also depends on the type of event (festival, club, etc) and a host of other factors.  Not all pay days are that large, obviously, because the economics have to work for the venue.  A small club will be paying at a much lower end of the scale.  Not surprisingly, the Vegas mega clubs pay HUGE - but they are selling lots of overpriced tables, bottles, and $15-30 drinks to high rollers, charging males as much as $100 for entry, while simultaneously using the DJs as a draw to their hotel/casino.

ericprydz,3bw5gj,djbayko,0,Thu Jul 2 23:37:23 2015 UTC,"The amount, I'm thinking he's made more, but like you said previously, most people, not just DJs, wouldn't want the public to know how much they really make."

ericprydz,3bw5gj,djbayko,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"One more thought.  I have nothing to back this up, but I imagine a big name DJ has a ton of bargaining power on NYE, which would drive up the cost.  Supply & demand.  There are so many parties all over the world that night, that everyone is booked.  It's not like a promoter can say, ""Eric, your asking price is too high.  I'm going with Hardwell instead.""  No, Hardwell is already booked for a shitload of money somewhere else."

Then, the part from 20 minutes until he closes with let me feel is a wild ride, it's absolutely nuts. Finally, when you're at the very tip of the mountain, you hear that sweet sweeet heaven like melody come on.......... omg what a rush. So beautiful, definitely my favorite set in a long time (right next to Maceo, who's been killing lately) , maybe of ALL TIME. So heavenly, I am still in awe.

However, you can't record using their software, unless you layer some 3rd party application over it to ""listen"" to the output, which is what I think you're proposing.  I provided the independent stream links because I imagine there would be a more direct way to record by plugging one of those links into an application that has the ability to record - fewer moving parts, fewer possible points of failure.  Make sense?  I just don't have the time to research right now.  Edit: If your method works, then great.  I just want to confirm that someone has tested it beforehand and plans to record the set for our collective enjoyment later 😎"

Ive recorded twice (two songs recorded in both itunes and safari) and inspected the recordings an saw no real difference in quality but recording at 256 exactly looks better on the spek application (shows a more in depth of audio quality). All in all it doesnt seem like there is no real difference in quality from the stream and through itunes, use whatever you can."
ericprydz,3btcu1,t3chnoshark,4,Thu Jul 2 02:01:07 2015 UTC,I would not count on him uploading it.  Apple may have the rights to it and may not want it distributed outside of their platform when they are trying to get people to join their new service.

ericprydz,3bpcm8,Fold0rDie,6,Wed Jul 1 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"Prydz & Atrak? Clearly they let Zane do his thing cause he picked 2 true DJs.

I'm really curious as to the length.  If One Mix has the same 2-hour format as Essential Mix, we could be in for a treat.  In any case, with the LPs and album coming out, it could indeed be interesting."

ericprydz,3bp8mw,marshallbritt,4,Wed Jul 1 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"Every one of you in here is gonna watch it..   I also doubt it has to do with home remodeling, especially since he is finishing up his studio build. Unless the studio build over the last few months involves this show."
ericprydz,3bp8mw,djbayko,2,Wed Jul 1 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"In the season preview, it looks like they are standing on his roof fixing something.  It's a show about remodeling...why wouldn't they remodel?  Maybe they leave his studio alone.  I wouldn't want remodelers touching something they know nothing about anyways.  Edit: I take back the part about being on his roof...I'm not sure that's Eric's roof. But it is a show about celebrity home remodeling, and he's prominently featured in both the press release and season trailer along with Brian Austin Green. LOL-ing at everyone being upset about this while they themselves could probably use a good interior designer."
ericprydz,3bp8mw,djbayko,2,Wed Jul 1 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"Episode 1 confirmed Prydz' home is th subkect of remodeling.  It won't be a single episode, but instead featured over multiple epiosodes through the season, along with other celebrity homes.  The studio (in a 2nd guest house) is part of the remodeling, so this was filmed back then."
ericprydz,3bp8mw,Fold0rDie,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"Seems kind of odd for him to be on this, especially if he let this wacko re-do his home. Eric seems to be a guy that wants to be in control."

ericprydz,3bp8mw,djbayko,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Based on the first episode, it looks like the format is the celebs will be spread out over multiple episodes as the work is completed over the season."

ericprydz,3bn7zm,SirSidneyShaw,10,Fri Jul 3 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"Step one: totally reconsider what u define as progressive house :)  Step two: listen to everything done by prydz (including Pryda and Cirez D), I think there is a guide on the sidebar  Step three: devour stuff by Jeremy Olander and Fehrplay. Also check out some Andre Sobota and Richard Knott  (I guess Grum to, even tho I'm not a huge fan)  Step Four: come to the realization that Eric is Eric and no one else is truly like him  Step Five: Listen to more prydz  Optional Step six: branch out into more ""underground"" sounds like deep prog on labels like lost & found and microcastle, get a little more technoey with labels like drumcode and bedrock (which is also a little proggy) (there r too many labels to list, you'll work it out)  Step Seven: wait a few yrs for him to play your generations tear shit up, sw4, mk id, shrine id and think to yourself, WTF R U DOING ERIC THIS IS NOT Y I LOVE U."
ericprydz,3bn7zm,evilabed23,6,Tue Jun 30 16:15:22 2015 UTC,Step 4 is the truly tragic one.  good thing 2015 has been one of his most productive years to date

ericprydz,3bn7zm,mugubushi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:17:34 2015 UTC,Mind elaborating what you mean in step 7?
ericprydz,3bn7zm,evilabed23,2,Thu Jul 2 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, sure thing. Its a joke, so dont take it the wrong way. This isnt true for everyone (probably the majority).  After being a hardcore fan for a while Eric will make a track that you just absolutely detest. It will most likely be a track that the majority of ""casual"" fans love. For the hardcore fans pre-2010 this track/s will be tear shit up, sw4 etc. For his fans that discovered him from 2010-2012 it will be MK ID, because it reminds them of the music they left behind/scares them that bros will start going to Eric's shows/they just really fucking hate the build up and drop and want eric to make the beautiful prog house or face melting techno they know him for.  Eric will play this ""awful"" track in every set for 12 months. The more casuals start loving it, the more the hate grows , because this isn't the Pryda they fell in love with. Casuals will start commenting on every prydz fb post asking for this track and you'll want to tell them to fuck off, because if he isn't going to give u pete tong id or capitol Id 02 they don't deserve the track they want.  Tether and Generate believe it or not can also fall in this category  Hopefully that makes sense, may sound elitist etc. But it's definitely a thing I've noticed.   (Anyone else reading this please don't yell at me)"
ericprydz,3bn7zm,Fold0rDie,2,Thu Jul 2 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"I get the vibe of your message. I am a new fan by any measure, but I don't know if I can call myself casual anymore. I have consumed so much Prydz in a scary cult-like fashion since Ultra 15' (and still so much to go) that I am becoming a snob as well. I was cringing at all those casual mooks falling over themselves with regards to Opus.  //I don't really like Tear Shit Up either, but do love me some MK ID"
ericprydz,3bn7zm,mugubushi,2,Thu Jul 2 21:31:01 2015 UTC,"It was a genuine question actually, because I noticed several other ""oldfag"" fans sharing the same sentiment as you.  To me, it's intriguing. I consider myself a ""newfag"" fan, since I didn't really listen to him until I stumbled upon his set at last year's EDC and I absolutely love Tether, Generate, Tear Shit Up, SW4, and MK ID. But then again, I absolutely love literally every song he's ever made and have a really hard time ""detesting"" any of it.  I've been listening to nothing but Prydz since that day and have been on an endless quest of searching for and downloading every set I can find by him. I love listening to them by release year and watching his style change, which is why I thought your opinion was an interesting read to me.  Personally, I favour his Cirez D sound, which is why I tell my friends I'd much rather go to a 3+ hour Cirez D set than an EPIC show, despite not having gone to either before. Still, I wouldn't mind seeing him in any setting, from festivals, to clubs, and underground scenes. If I could afford it, I'd just follow him around like a groupie.  I've definitely developed an elitist attitude as well, but only in regards to other EDM artists. As someone who was pretty much the stereotypical ""bro"" you were talking about who was always front and centre for mainstream acts, I've come to a point where everything else just makes me cringe. It's because of Prydz that I was able to see the error of my ways and come to detest the generic ""build up, drop, rinse, repeat"" attitude that's in pretty much everything else out there. To me, Prydz's music is like a Hattori Hanzo sword:  (From Kill Bill Vol. 2)   Elle Driver: Bill tells me you had a Hanzo sword once.  Budd: Yeah.  Elle Driver: [examining the Bride's sword] How does this one compare to that one?  Budd: If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every other sword ever made... that wasn't made by Hattori Hanzo."

I am new by your standards, but not exactly short on heart and my library of tracks is expansive.  I wish I had heard Prydz years ago when I listened to ""weird"" music like everything but the girl and portishead. I am from a very small sheltered bible belt town where I did not have access to such artistry. Le sigh....Until I am on your level, I'll just sit here loving everything Prydz touches because after 3 1/2 years, I am still in love with his work."
ericprydz,3bn7zm,djbayko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what you think is progressive house is not progressive house.  Beatport changed the definition because of difficulty cataloging tracks.  I guess I'm wrong though.  They've succeeded in miseducating the masses.  That's one way that language changes - thru  persistent error."
ericprydz,3bn7zm,sunburst09,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:11:42 2015 UTC,Richard has like 5 tracks please explain to me how you are mentioning him as if he is on par with Eric? Don't just give away promotion for someone's music because they are associated with who you listen to... make them earn it by consistently releasing good material the way the rest have
ericprydz,3bn7zm,evilabed23,5,Wed Jul 1 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"If u read step 4 I said no one was on par with Eric, Knott isnt obviously close, but he does have a similar sound.  I mention Knott because I love what he does, he has a Pryda-ish sound and I would love for him to get more exposure. I have never met the guy, dont know him at all, but I dig what he does. He isnt a full-time producer like the other guys, mostly because prog is a somewhat dead genre and there isnt enough room for anymore prog producers atm. Getting that breakthrough is hard. Cant spend all your life chasing a dream fulltime, got to work and shit to live.  Check out his unreleased tracks Ghost and Strangers (you can find them in mixes). Also Locus Solus is probably one of the 3 best PRYF releases of all time, the atmosphere in that track is insane. Outlaw, Mantra and Push are all Pryda-ish. The fact Eric has played his tracks imo is a warranted factor in him getting a mention here, but obviously you know better than Eric. Eric also had him play on his Pryda Friends Arena last yr at Creamfields and at the SW4 afterparty.  And if consistently releasing good material was needed I wouldnt have been a fan of Eric's the last 9 months. I guess your answer to this question would be only listen to Eric and no one else?"

But thats the point, listen to Melo, Lycka, 2night, Illusions then finish off with Glimma. Now situate your mind in a dark, dirty nightclub and drop some Cirez if your ready for it but you may never return."
ericprydz,3bn7zm,msmills1322,3,Wed Jul 1 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Go on 1001 tracklists and look at the tracklists for Fehrplay and Jeremy Olanders sets. It's a great way to find artists with a similar sound.  Usually Fehrplay is the one who plays more of other peoples music and Jeremy has more IDs.   I reccomend you check out Chymera (Dreamrunner and Gregor Treshers remix of Shadowdancer), Fasttrack and Maulen, Henry Saiz (Uncharted), Eelke Kleijn (Oranje Leifde) , Kolsch (Unterwegs) but none of them have that Prydz feel, the only people who really come close are Fehrplay and Jeremy IMO.  Check out all the Epic Radios as he usually plays some tracks other than his own and also look into his other aliases such as Tonja Holma, Moo etc  Also look back through this sub as many of us have posted tracks that sound similar to Erics."

I have a bunch for capitol 02 if you are intersted, he changed it a bit after the time. Have to say I wasnt there for both sets hamburg & hannover, but he played his best unreleased work there, here you can check out the tracklists if you havnt heard them yet: http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/31494_eric-prydz-at-capitol-hannover-germany-2011-06-12.html, http://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/31471_eric-prydz-at-edelfettwerk-hamburg-2011-10-07.html.

ericprydz,3bjx0k,coloco21,2,Mon Jun 29 23:37:13 2015 UTC,Creamfields might be in the artist album tho.
ericprydz,3bjx0k,sixsixmusic,2,Mon Jun 29 23:43:22 2015 UTC,I think Creamfields for sure too but I don't know if it'll be Pryda or on the Eric Prydz album.
ericprydz,3bjx0k,moon_master345,2,Tue Jun 30 00:23:44 2015 UTC,My bet is on the new shit with one old ID.  Like Firestone > Shrine > Snaz/Exit > MSG ID 1/2

ericprydz,3bjx0k,coloco21,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:59:50 2015 UTC,It's techno. Also I'm pretty sure there were Cirez visuals before the official visuals for Shrine were made.
ericprydz,3bjx0k,lolz_alot,3,Mon Jun 29 23:02:53 2015 UTC,"love me some Cirez but is shrine is 100% not real techno. Not in the slightest, let's stop using that term so loosely.."
ericprydz,3bjx0k,evilabed23,3,Tue Jun 30 00:59:45 2015 UTC,Its 100% not close to real prog tho either. If u had to shove it under one of the two aliases it would be cirez d (or maybe it should be Eric prydz because of how much mainstream appeal it has)
ericprydz,3bjx0k,lolz_alot,2,Tue Jun 30 01:40:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. It's just not something I'd want to hear in a club, which is the foundational setting of techno. Idc about alias classification the track itself is just a festival banger with some (very few in fact) techno elements"
ericprydz,3bjx0k,Allein_aLiam,2,Tue Jun 30 02:30:37 2015 UTC,I've heard Shrine in 5 clubs and it's never not awesome....jussayin.  obviously it's not pure techno but it's closer to techno than prog.  if I had to pick a genre I'd pick 'Cirez Filth'
ericprydz,3bjx0k,coloco21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:25:21 2015 UTC,Well then MK ID is also Pryda so Eric's naming convention is  a bit weird

ericprydz,3bjx0k,PeteTongIDeal,2,Tue Jun 30 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"Backdraft is 100 % pryda. Origins someone could argue, since I'm not very fond of this track dont really care about whether its cirez or pryda. Not saying that you are wrong about shrine, but imo its a cirez track and I think most people will agree on that."

ericprydz,3bfhao,BrokeMike,8,Sun Jun 28 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'm really going to wait until next week to judge this. Most of the stuff he has put out in the last 10 years have been Pryda/Cirez D releases. Which have a more distinct club feel to them.   Tether, Generate and now Opus are all Eric Prydz tracks. Geared more towards the mainstream festival crowd. While I agree the tracks are good, they aren't the same. Yet I think he knows now is the time to strike. The Big Room bubble is bound to burst, he is looking to lead a new form of popular Dance Music to the mainstream.   Think Armin and Tiesto before they surged. Let's just hope Eric learns from history and stays true."
ericprydz,3bfhao,TheDarkDub,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"yea I'm curious how things will play out, but i'm just kinda sad that its not like spine chilling stuff anymore."

ericprydz,3bfhao,qpb,2,Sun Jun 28 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"yes great insight my man. I fully agree with you except for MSG ID 02, to me that track if fully on par with his old stuff."

To answer your question, I don't see him as being any more commercial than before.  He still makes his more commercial-friendly singles in between Pryda/Cirez songs that mostly only his fans will enjoy."
ericprydz,3bfhao,ababev26,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"yea sorry about that I meant consensus. I guess your right, but I haven't been feeling the same way about those like I usually feel about erics songs."
ericprydz,3bfhao,Otter_in_Jeans,5,Sun Jun 28 20:06:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer: certainly different, but overall more diverse. So he can't appeal to everyone all the time.   I agree with the general opinion here that he has personas that appeal to different crowds. I think, given the fact that he has become more mainstream, he has done a great job staying true to his long time fans by creating a range of sounds that are still distinctly his. That being said, I was not super impressed with Opus from the recording, tether I feel is ok and generate and liberate are great. I think with his newer releases he is trying to be a bit more festival/commercial friendly since that's his bread and butter. He uses those tracks to get people interested then crushes them with deeper stuff and IDs. Though looking back at old stuff, his songs from Pryda album are amazing and varied but, mostly, are not suited for live performances. I personally would like to see more of a Pryda/Cirez D takeover as I listen to him mostly for the deep, dark, techno feel.   EDIT: It would also be helpful if you gave some specific examples of tracks you are comparing."

ericprydz,3bfhao,Otter_in_Jeans,3,Sun Jun 28 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for the original mija or much of that ep. The festival edit is on anther level though. Pretty much everything he has released since Pryda hasn't been as good IMO. I liked that he didn't really release much music before, his music is much better to listen to live than stand alone tracks."
ericprydz,3bfhao,DOWDKR01,2,Mon Jun 29 18:17:31 2015 UTC,wow... i think mija is his best track. by far. that 'song' (more like 'musical sermon') sounds like it took a team a scientists to make... the track is unbelievably layered and detailed. it's the most played in my library for sure.
ericprydz,3bfhao,ababev26,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:59:06 2015 UTC,funny u mention that. I love mija. I'm talking more about the songs that have come about around the generate tour and so on.

ericprydz,3bfhao,evilabed23,4,Mon Jun 29 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"I hear you and I feel the same way, but we need to remember that less than a year ago we got a four track EP with some of his best music to date. Eric kind of goes in a cycle and I have no doubt he will return to making tracks that are more appealing to the people who like his older stuff. It is slightly disconcerting the amount of love Opus is getting (people saying the track is a gamechanger is kind of ridiculous to me, Powerdrive was a gamechanger, this I feel is nowhere near that) when I bet these people have never listened to anything like Remember or Frankfurt or Nile. I'm glad people like his music, but I feel people who now love Eric for Opus are almost as bad as the people who loved Eric for Call on me. After Call on me he made Pryda Recordings so hopefully tracks like this lead Eric to making more dark Pryda after the album."

ericprydz,3b74v8,HDYBYZ,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:11 2015 UTC,I was talking to the guy on ebay about those prydz shirt a while ago. He doesn't know if they're authorized prydz merch or not. OP buy a shirt and let me know how they are. lol
ericprydz,3b74v8,Synacku,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:45:43 2015 UTC,This is one that I got from a festival 3 years ago. Same thing except no red circle. Just the black shirt and silver PRYDA text. So badass.   Sorry to say I have no idea where to get one now.
ericprydz,3b74v8,Cougah,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"iirc, the user (atticus) who ran those tee shirt campaigns will not be doing them anymore now that Eric has his own authentic merch store. Even though merch stores are expensive, at least they support the artist. Glad I got two though before that ha!"
ericprydz,3b74v8,Fold0rDie,0,Thu Jul 2 06:39:15 2015 UTC,Is atticus going to do another group shirt buy toward the end of the year? I'm down to buy at least two (based on last year's designs)

ericprydz,3b0kex,compooterxc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:29:04 2015 UTC,This can be posted a million times over and will always be relevant.
ericprydz,3azasy,stepbacktakeaim,8,Wed Jun 24 18:27:53 2015 UTC,Seeing it and obviously hearing it live with the visuals at Circuit Grounds made it very special.
ericprydz,3azasy,LYD2Z,5,Wed Jun 24 22:08:37 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel.  It was massive being there!  Not so much on soundcloud.  Still brings back that feeling though... Praise Pryda
ericprydz,3azasy,Dishwallah,4,Wed Jun 24 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fanboy above all else but comparing this to Strobe is silly.  It's really not the same at all.  I get what people are saying, but the way Strobe is structured is completely different."
ericprydz,3azasy,eatingcarbs,3,Thu Jun 25 12:28:25 2015 UTC,"Aye, I agree with that sentiment.  This is a great song for sure, but the strobe comparisons fall flat."
ericprydz,3azasy,Open_Eye_Signal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well yes, when you get down to the formalities of structure, they are quite different. However, Strobe and ID 02 play a similar role in relation to the rest of Deadmau5's and Prydz's body of work. The comparison is not unwarranted."
ericprydz,3azasy,atticus18244fsas,6,Thu Jun 25 19:14:36 2015 UTC,Feel like the hype is way too high for this one. It's not a bad song but in my opinion not good enough to generate the reaction it has.
ericprydz,3azasy,djbayko,9,Wed Jun 24 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"So strange.  I guess you had to experience it live.  I was floored.  For the record, I LOVED the first ID as well, but this one is different."
ericprydz,3azasy,john3448,3,Thu Jun 25 00:50:48 2015 UTC,"I saw the video that was posted first and I was really jealous I wasn't there. Heard it on Soundcloud and it still was great. Would have been better seeing it live, but you can't deny that it is a really cool song."
ericprydz,3azasy,Dishwallah,2,Thu Jun 25 03:01:47 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm over the shock of hearing it live I kind of agree.  Under the CircuitGrounds the build up seemed much more drawn out and intense.  Still my favorite moment from EDC15, but it doesn't have the same feel listening to it at home."
ericprydz,3azasy,Fold0rDie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:40:34 2015 UTC,"Agree, I've listened to it a few more times and I can't share the same level of excitement as some others. I instantly loved the first new ID with Whitney Houston's vocals (joke) though."
ericprydz,3azasy,Artrovian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:47:30 2015 UTC,I agree with you guys. The first ID of the set has that pure Pryda essence. As for the rest of the set...I just don't feel it.
ericprydz,3azasy,Otsel7,-1,Wed Jun 24 21:55:11 2015 UTC,I agree. It's too cheesy for my liking.
ericprydz,3azasy,Rumsies,-3,Wed Jun 24 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, nail on the head. This is worse than mk ID for me. The whole of EDC was pretty meh to be fair. Hour long sets from a few years ago were usually much better (as good as an hour long set can be anyway)."
ericprydz,3azasy,YAYYYwork,0,Wed Jun 24 23:02:21 2015 UTC,Ultra & edcny this year were on point. Edclv was not as good.
ericprydz,3azasy,Cougah,-1,Thu Jun 25 00:38:52 2015 UTC,I also thought it was a little vanilla. Sort of like one he pulled together just for shits and giggles or something. It opened well but didn't do much after that. Hyped because the opening and it being the last track of his set.
ericprydz,3azasy,moon_master345,4,Thu Jun 25 02:43:13 2015 UTC,This song is gonna change everything
ericprydz,3azasy,mugubushi,3,Wed Jun 24 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"It already has—have you heard what everyone's been saying about it, including those unfamiliar with the Prydz?"
ericprydz,3azasy,rag3fac3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:08:24 2015 UTC,Like on Twitter or something?
ericprydz,3azasy,TheDarkDub,3,Wed Jun 24 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"Everywhere. The hype is real on this one. Comparing it to Strobe, which I hate because Eric has so many better songs than Strobe already. But the hype is real."
ericprydz,3azasy,djbayko,2,Wed Jun 24 22:00:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I get the comparisons.  I had the same thoughts myself as I was experiencing it at Circuit Grounds the other night.  Like Strobe, it's an epic ballad...a roller coaster of emotion in itself.  He played it in its entirety from beginnig to end, without any mixing for a reason."
ericprydz,3azasy,TheDarkDub,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:49:36 2015 UTC,Because it wasn't a complimentary key with New City Gas. Eric regularly washes songs out and starts others without mixing.
ericprydz,3azasy,djpeekz,2,Thu Jun 25 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"Also it's a little bit difficult to mix a tune with a changing tempo, regardless of whether it's in key or not"
ericprydz,3azasy,TheDarkDub,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:48:21 2015 UTC,The intro doesn't really change.
ericprydz,3azasy,djpeekz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:22:14 2015 UTC,Wut
ericprydz,3azasy,TheDarkDub,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"Eric usually will run a subtle pad underneath his mixes, especially when in that style. Or he will hang the last song in a delay and reverb loop. He out right killed it, and didn't add anything to it.   It was a weak mix, of an okay song. I understand the hype, but I don't particularly like the song.  And it's easy enough to loop the first two bars 4, 8 or 16 times to achieve a smooth mix."
ericprydz,3azasy,djbayko,2,Thu Jun 25 04:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, but don't you think there was a reason he was okay with doing that style of mixing for this song?  He would have planned his set differently if it wasn't a song he wanted to play through."

ericprydz,3b0gs3,coloco21,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:33:52 2015 UTC,I was thinking it was going to be a lot of tracks? He produces every day so I'd say he has way more than 11 tracks produced from January 2004 to December 2014. He said he's been writing this in his head for over 10 years so I'm expecting something big
ericprydz,3b0gs3,lurchh,2,Thu Jun 25 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"But it's an artist album. He's looking to create a cohesive musical work, not just release every song that he has made in a package."
ericprydz,3b0gs3,Open_Eye_Signal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, explains why the most recent IDs all have the same kind of ""feel"" to them"
ericprydz,3b0gs3,lurchh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"I mean who knows what he really has in store though. Most electronic artist albums aren't just hit after hit, they have transitional songs and many songs that play different roles on the album."
ericprydz,3b0gs3,Open_Eye_Signal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:00:56 2015 UTC,somewhere between 10 and 600.  lol he hasn't announced

ericprydz,3avl6t,jee023,3,Wed Jun 24 02:53:35 2015 UTC,He doesn't not play it because it's a bad track...
ericprydz,3avl6t,BowenMarsh,5,Wed Jun 24 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"He doesnt play it because it totally doesnt represent who he is as an artist and he doesnt want the associated crowd coming to his sets and creating a terrible vibe. There was a time in 2008 when he was getting booed for not playing it, so hes definitely trying to keep himself distanced from that situation"

ericprydz,3asi45,fredomau5,22,Tue Jun 23 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that flag all day after seeing it in action in this video. I didn't get a chance to go to EDC this year, but I've been a devoted Prydateer for exactly one year now since I first saw him at last year's EDC. I know Prydz is known for his insane lasers and visuals. I know his music is soul-touching. I know everything he does is pretty much considered holy. But the same could be said by any fan of any artist. I could walk the crowd of an Above & Beyond performance and hear people saying ""these guys are my favourite!"" or see signs that say ""I <3 A&B!"" or bump into guys saying ""watch this, I'm going to propose to my girl here!"" (I really did see all three of these at last year's EDC)  But on that Pryda flag, there was no ""I"". It was simply ""Pryda"". That guy was up front and centre, looking straight at Prydz himself, waving it with all his might for what I assume was the entire set. He waved it passionately even without a selfish call for attention scrawled on it. He waved it knowing it stood for something more than himself.  I had been thinking about that flag all day and how it made me feel. It wasn't just beautiful and glorious. It was a feeling that made me realise I was a part of something bigger than myself. I suddenly felt small and insignificant as an individual, but in a good way. I was reminded of how much beauty there was in the world and how I would willingly give my life for it.  That is the feeling I got from seeing the Pryda flag: patriotism. Not for any one country, but for the world, the universe, and all there is outside of myself. It's the same feeling I get listening to Prydz's music. I can easily lose sense of myself and who I am, but I don't care, because it's just so grand and beautiful. Watching that flag wave and knowing a million others around the world feel exactly like I do makes me all the more humbled to be a part of a State of Pryda."
ericprydz,3asi45,mugubushi,10,Tue Jun 23 12:44:22 2015 UTC,I am so glad you noticed the amount of passion and love that she put into it. What you said is EXACTLY how I would describe /u/This1sWrong and her love of Prydz. Unselfish and unconditional. Having him acknowledge it meant everything to her and to me. We carried that flag all three days and it was so worth it!
ericprydz,3asi45,areeoddnuh,4,Tue Jun 23 15:13:28 2015 UTC,You two were great. It was nice to see people as passionate as many of us are about Prydz going out to visibly demonstrate it. That acknowledgment by him must have an indescribable feeling.
ericprydz,3asi45,Fold0rDie,5,Tue Jun 23 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"If we weren't pumped full of adrenaline, I'm sure we would've cried. That set WAS the entire weekend! And when he pointed at her and smiled it was just amazing! I felt so incredibly happy for her."
ericprydz,3asi45,areeoddnuh,2,Tue Jun 23 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, man. I wish this part was caught on video. Being acknowledged by him is like having Jesus tell you you're doing good with your life."

ericprydz,3asi45,areeoddnuh,4,Wed Jun 24 02:52:16 2015 UTC,"Normally people waving flags right in front of the stage annoy me, but this time it inspired me.

I wish I could wave a Pryda flag around for the rest of my life."
ericprydz,3asi45,funboat,3,Tue Jun 23 17:10:15 2015 UTC,I wish I could wave a Pryda flag around for the rest of my life.   Anyone who utters these words is an awesome person.

ericprydz,3asi45,O_Shag_Hennessy,2,Tue Jun 23 07:16:06 2015 UTC,They used University Customs

ericprydz,3asi45,stepbacktakeaim,3,Tue Jun 23 15:17:27 2015 UTC,That flag was awesome. If I ever bring something to EDC it will be Pryda flag.
ericprydz,3asi45,isnotmyrealusername,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:26:36 2015 UTC,You can make it pretty easy for like $30 I'm guessing. I saw people recommending University Customs and they have a reddit profile. I plan on making a custom Pryda-ish one myself.

ericprydz,3aqbf8,YumRangoon,21,Mon Jun 22 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"Hey guys.  Not sure if you are interested, but I took the Prydz soundcloud release and cut it together with the Channel 51 BPM rebroadcast to eliminate as many advertisements as possible since most of them were in different places. My Channel 51 rip was captured with Adobe Audition and an Asus soundcard.  I actually think it sounds better than the official Prydz upload, so I used that more often than the soundcloud version.  Sadly one of the ads was unavoidable at around 30minutes since it was in both broadcasts at literally the same time, but it's a helluva lot better than the 8 or 9 sprinkled throughout the set.  I also was able to eliminate a few recording glitches (but not all of them).  I tried to keep the soundlevels for the transitions as close as possible, but they were recorded at very different levels, but there is no clipping, and you shouldn't be able to tell for like 90% of the transitions unless you are closely listening.  320KBPS MP3  https://mega.co.nz/#!NIBXzBSZ!NGiD-l5n6wj7uDTmTak4NACBDzz1uUJPFRYnrHyBxJg  I can also include the wav for you transcode haters.    I also did this with Ultra 2015 and was able to eliminate ALL adverts, here is the link for those interested.  https://mega.co.nz/#!MIJAkQKT!MyByRoagUTmoMvfEtayQMNKP1ci4NkBz4OJWzXiugts"
ericprydz,3aqbf8,porksandwich9113,6,Tue Jun 23 00:22:42 2015 UTC,YAY! So excited to have a good quality version of edc ID 02. What a monster track. Whole set was amazing.

ericprydz,3aqbf8,Natchz,6,Tue Jun 23 16:51:04 2015 UTC,"This years Ultra set is by far the best live recording I've ever heard, is it so much to ask for consistent quality recording?"
ericprydz,3aqbf8,sunburst09,2,Mon Jun 22 20:08:39 2015 UTC,I agree.  SiriusXM was having serious issues all weekend for me.  Certain sets sounded like they were literally recorded with a microphone.
ericprydz,3aqbf8,porksandwich9113,4,Mon Jun 22 23:57:39 2015 UTC,Shrine ID is so 🔥
ericprydz,3aqbf8,fingers-crossed,3,Mon Jun 22 20:22:30 2015 UTC,I can't add the .wav to my iTunes. Anyone else having this problem?
ericprydz,3aqbf8,jeboody,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"Some people had the same problem including trouble converting it (including me), I converted it successfully a different way. This official recording has more bass/volume imo. Here ya go if you want"
ericprydz,3aqbf8,t3chnoshark,3,Tue Jun 23 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"good lord, both of the new tracks from this set are so damn good."
ericprydz,3aqbf8,constantlyoff,2,Tue Jun 23 00:58:18 2015 UTC,.wav quality? Really? Edit: But its only 160 megs? not really wav
ericprydz,3aqbf8,t3chnoshark,3,Mon Jun 22 18:38:13 2015 UTC,Eric and Jeremy have been posting some strange files to soundcloud recently. Copyright protection on sets and incorrect extensions.
ericprydz,3aqbf8,sixsixmusic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:30:24 2015 UTC,Weird how does that help not getting taken down by copyright?
ericprydz,3aqbf8,t3chnoshark,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:12:37 2015 UTC,It doesn't
ericprydz,3aqbf8,djpeekz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:01:50 2015 UTC,They don't have copyright issues with soundcloud. They own all the music they play. I think they're trying to stop bootlegging.
ericprydz,3aqbf8,sixsixmusic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:23:05 2015 UTC,Explain..?
ericprydz,3aqbf8,marshallbritt,2,Tue Jun 23 03:52:59 2015 UTC,If you download this EDC set or Jeremy's lofi set and try to load it into Ableton and some other DAW's it spits an error back at you. They must want to stop bootlegging.
ericprydz,3aqbf8,sixsixmusic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:25:02 2015 UTC,"Have you tried converting the audio file? or loading it from the import audio from your HD option? (instead of drag and drop, if you are). I use Logic pro for all my production and it just converts it to AIFF, if a WAV file is introduced. There are also different ""Bit Floats"" that our DAWs dont support. If I drop a 32 bit float WAV file in logic is will not convert (Maybe it would in Logic X which is 64bit program which Eric is using now) That could have something to do with it (Maybe). has to be 16 bit or 24 bit float WAV file. WAVs can contain different ""codecs"", this is where it goes over most people heads. At that, codecs could be use as ""lock"" on a file. On another note, Eric said in an interview from a Berns - Stockholm show circa 2009, that he was worried about recording shows because over there people could press his new tracks to vinyl and sell them. Im sure his vibe hasn't changed."
ericprydz,3aqbf8,marshallbritt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:35:54 2015 UTC,Oh it's easy to get around but I think they're just doing something to scare off casual bootleggers. Maybe? Haha.
ericprydz,3aqbf8,sixsixmusic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"You are right, a true .wav file does not exsist for any of this stuff. Also, Soundcloud uploads are downsampled to 128Kbps, i dont know why everyone thinks they are getting these bit rates out of these sets."
ericprydz,3aqbf8,marshallbritt,2,Tue Jun 23 04:08:40 2015 UTC,"We just record it at that quality just in case because we arent always 100% that sirius always streams it at 128kbps or a bit higher, no harm no foul. But this file download is weird"
ericprydz,3aqbf8,t3chnoshark,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"the fact that its says .wav @ 153MB? had to have been someone in the exchange of hands from (XM guys) or Eric (not likely) along the way with an audio converter that just had it set ""WAV"". Same goes for everyones rips of the set. I agree, no harm "" foul."
ericprydz,3aqbf8,marshallbritt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"To others who have commented on it, parts of this are EQ'd heavily too."

ericprydz,3aognv,Allein_aLiam,6,Mon Jun 22 05:48:01 2015 UTC,"he doesn't regret making it.  there was a disagreement between him and management/labels and the video was released without his approval, causing it to become a huge hit for the wrong reasons, according to Eric.  he basically doesn't play it out of spite because he doesn't want to be associated with it"
ericprydz,3aognv,Fold0rDie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"He didn't agree to the actual content of the video too, right? AFAIK, Prydz doesn't use sex to sell his wares."

ericprydz,3anab3,Fold0rDie,10,Mon Jun 22 06:30:51 2015 UTC,"it's a festival set meaning heavy hitters, new IDs, crowd pleasers, etc. compressed into an hour. he can't really dig deep into his crate without at least two hours, considering he plays out entire tracks and most tracks run north of 6 minutes apiece."
ericprydz,3anab3,joco77103,3,Sun Jun 21 22:57:41 2015 UTC,yep. going into new city gas ID and whatever this sexy ID is was just echo/delay decay and just hitting play on the next track. no long ass blends that slowly introduce the new tracks and no flow :(
ericprydz,3anab3,rag3fac3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:59:54 2015 UTC,The recent EDC NY and Ultra are a million times better.  No flow to this set.
ericprydz,3anab3,joco77103,5,Sun Jun 21 23:03:30 2015 UTC,Haven't heard too many transitions...just song to song.  I was lucky enough to be at Ultra...fucking Life Changing
ericprydz,3anab3,rag3fac3,3,Sun Jun 21 23:05:22 2015 UTC,Yea the ultra set was amazing. still one of my favorites to listen to.
ericprydz,3anab3,YAYYYwork,5,Sun Jun 21 23:01:32 2015 UTC,sometimes I think I have a problem...I've listened to it probably 50 times haha
ericprydz,3anab3,Fold0rDie,3,Sun Jun 21 23:03:23 2015 UTC,Yea that makes two of us. My play count for the 2013 essential mix and his NYE echostage set are well north of that by now too.
ericprydz,3anab3,YAYYYwork,2,Sun Jun 21 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"Amen. I have been worshiping at the temple of Prydz since I was there for that set...it was dark, but still uplifting."
ericprydz,3anab3,cirezdyrp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:13:31 2015 UTC,Were you at EDC? I know Ultra was great but this set was pure magic. So much room. Best crowd. Unreal production. Ultra may sound better on Sirius but being at both truly makes a difference ;)
ericprydz,3anj7g,Fold0rDie,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:31:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rip -- I saw the entire discussion about the quality (which is not baseless), but understandable given that we're not all certified audio technicians here.     That last ID... ermm... if it's truly a new Pryda ID, did Eric just outdo deadmau5 (Strobe)?"
ericprydz,3anj7g,bwbae,0,Mon Jun 22 08:19:34 2015 UTC,My first attempt so be gentle. I'll rip out the interview in the beginning after I get back from dinner. Let me know if there's a screw up in the file.
ericprydz,3anj7g,tuan2195,3,Sun Jun 21 23:31:50 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the effort but I'm not sure why it sounds pretty bad, I guess it has something to do with the stereo configuration."
ericprydz,3anj7g,porksandwich9113,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:13:49 2015 UTC,The low end is EQ'd out pretty hard.  I am capping the re-broadcast on SiriusXM channel 51 BPM right now.  Should be done in around an hour.
ericprydz,3anj7g,tuan2195,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and my apology to OP if this is how it was broadcasted."
ericprydz,3anj7g,porksandwich9113,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't.  I was stuck on the road, so I streamed through my phone with an aux into my car and I sounded much better.   I'm guessing OP probably has an EQ set up, or was possibly streaming the siriusXM low quality option?  I too appreciate the effort, but something was definitely off with the setup."
ericprydz,3anj7g,tuan2195,2,Mon Jun 22 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean when I said I thought something went wrong with the stereo config, it seems like the one of the two channels was phase inverted, which cancel out the bass... Either way I'll keep an eye out for your record."

I don't know who the hell Baggi Begovic is, but I don't get paid to be broadcasting electronic dance music for a living...  //rant off"

I just find it hard to believe you can't find knowledgeable, professional people in this day and age to cover the industry. It's like Sirius XM hired two bozos from a Like Mike/Dimitri Vegas rave and said have fun boys!"

ericprydz,39vawy,rebelkids,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"If TML has the same amount of stages as last year, there's still a couple to be announced each day - and there's been no announcement that the complete lineup is done, so sit tight and keep those fingers crossed I guess.

ericprydz,39vawy,djpeekz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:08:13 2015 UTC,"There are still a few stages to be announced indeed, but those are the really small stages. Prydz will definately not play at one of those.   And since all of the big stages have been announced, I would think it'll be very unlikely that he's playing there this year :("
ericprydz,39nzbc,joco77103,6,Sat Jun 13 03:08:29 2015 UTC,I saw videos of his main stage 2013 set. Wasn't impressed . That's just not his crowd.   Being under a roof made a HUUUGE difference the following year.
ericprydz,39nzbc,mugubushi,2,Sat Jun 13 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I was there in 2013 and the crowd was brutal. Pretty sure he was playing right before Avicii, which didn't help things..."
ericprydz,39nzbc,prydaprydzcirez,3,Sun Jun 14 01:07:47 2015 UTC,Yes!!  Circuit Grounds is the perfect venue for his laser show.  I was hoping he wouldn't be at Kinetic.
ericprydz,39nzbc,djbayko,3,Sat Jun 13 08:10:56 2015 UTC,Was very nervous for EDCNY with Eric on the main stage. He came out playing straight fire though and I was thrilled.
ericprydz,39nzbc,YAYYYwork,3,Mon Jun 15 17:31:56 2015 UTC,"While its nice that he will be off the main to do his thing, I can't pretend sharing a stage with 3lau, Carnage and Krewella isn't somewhat degrading"
ericprydz,39nzbc,sunburst09,7,Sat Jun 13 20:57:20 2015 UTC,I don't see why they can't build a stage just for him.
ericprydz,39nzbc,mugubushi,2,Sun Jun 14 04:35:50 2015 UTC,"Why?  This is a reality for festivals.  It's not like they're playing at the same time.  When Prydz is on, Carnage fans will likely be elsewhwere."
ericprydz,39nzbc,djbayko,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I couldn't be happier about this. His main stage EDC set 2013 was the ONLY disappointing set of his I've ever seen and I'm so glad that Insomniac made this decision."

ericprydz,39o8u2,Cougah,2,Sat Jun 13 15:16:57 2015 UTC,The Mid set was absolutely perfect. The best live performance hes done in a long time. Better than E3.0!
ericprydz,39o8u2,Supermoon62413,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:48:08 2015 UTC,It was downright incredible. I wish I hadn't gotten so drunk at the end so I could remember more of what he played.
ericprydz,39o8u2,Couldigga,2,Sun Jun 21 23:28:57 2015 UTC,I have a full recording from my iPhone of the SA set. Is anyone good with audio mastering that could suppress the bass and bump some of the sound quality?
ericprydz,39o8u2,Supermoon62413,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:17:55 2015 UTC,I'd make a post on the sub with this request!
ericprydz,39o8u2,stepbacktakeaim,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:54:29 2015 UTC,any update to this? still no full set posted anywhere. pretty bummed out
ericprydz,39lsf5,housmith,4,Fri Jun 12 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"thanks for the sc playlist at least I can listen to the id's on sc now without lags like with YT  animal garden&the drew,bronte were given away as well"
ericprydz,39lsf5,PeteTongIDeal,2,Fri Jun 12 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"really? only one comment on this? appreciate the link and compiling all the tunes together, lotta stuff I haven't heard. thank you."
ericprydz,39lsf5,Munz3215,2,Mon Jun 15 06:56:33 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Thanks for posting!
ericprydz,39cf43,ababev26,12,Wed Jun 10 20:44:28 2015 UTC,Nice story ababev.  Thanks for being a great contributor to this subreddit.
ericprydz,39cf43,atticus18244fsas,7,Wed Jun 10 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"I think Eric doesn't realize how many lives he has impacted and got out of depression... I was almost crying listening to the bautifulness of Javlar and Inspiration just before seeing your post. Great to hear you managed to find a good ending for your story.  Also, if joy was a track, it would be New City Gas ID"
ericprydz,39cf43,coloco21,2,Wed Jun 10 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"Upvote for you and for ababev, great story Sir , glad to hear another person being moved/helped by ERics music. I remember like it was yesterday, that I heard the privilege id 2013/queen club paris id 2010 for the first time and started to cry like a little baby, because that track made me so happy, it was 4 am in the morning and I just had to listen to his set and it was amazing."
ericprydz,39cf43,PeteTongIDeal,3,Wed Jun 10 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"There's no way he's not releasing QCP2010 ID in the album or the EPs. Same for Creamfields 2011 (but no 2010 tho :/ ) and Snaz (and hopefully Pete Tong ID so you can change your reddit username :p).  To go back to QCP2010, it's really an amazing track. Takes the melody from Bedtime Stories which sampled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43rFiDqlXYQ but he made such a great work around this melody, the build up is incredible too.  Really excited for July, hopefully we'll get some teasers soon"
ericprydz,39cf43,coloco21,2,Wed Jun 10 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah so we can see/hear what will be on the upcoming ep's, and yes hopefully I can change my name then, haha"
ericprydz,39cf43,PeteTongIDeal,5,Wed Jun 10 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for what has happened to you cause I have dealt with depression and existential crises too in the recent years, but always kept it to myself. I have been listening to Prydz since I was a kid and whenever I felt I needed emotional support always turned to Eric. Maybe this is why I have always been more attracted to the more emotional side of Pryda rather than his club-friendlier tracks. I'll always be thankful for tracks like The Gift, Waves, or Emos, since they always did uplift me spiritually."
ericprydz,39cf43,urbantales,2,Wed Jun 10 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"nice to know that there is at least one element in the world, which makes you feel connected to it, isn't it? :) hang in there"
ericprydz,39cf43,SummerMadnessfi,2,Wed Jun 10 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"I don't suffer from depression but whenever i feel like shit music by Eric, Kolsch, Maceo PLex and Royksopp always makes me feel better."
ericprydz,39cf43,noodleface4,5,Thu Jun 11 10:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think many of us can personally, not just musically, relate to your beautiful post. I've been struggling through a lot of soul searching myself this past year. Like you, I've found that music, especially Eric's, can be incredibly therapeutic. Who knows where we all would be without it. Thanks for sharing!"
ericprydz,39cf43,gtevans19,3,Thu Jun 11 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"That 3 hour set at New City Gas was serious, I had broken my ankle and still went in a walking cast."
ericprydz,39cf43,TheTerminatorQc,2,Wed Jun 10 22:47:40 2015 UTC,what a champ
ericprydz,39cf43,cookiemonsta122,3,Thu Jun 11 01:50:40 2015 UTC,lycka and melo are awesome songs indeed.  and the new city gas ID is also really nice
ericprydz,39cf43,Niman30,2,Thu Jun 11 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"man, I can totally relate.  glad you are coming into your own and leading a happy and rewarding life!  in Pryda we trust :)"
ericprydz,39cf43,Allein_aLiam,2,Thu Jun 11 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"He has helped me immensely as well. I know a lot of fans shit on Liberate, but it's uplifting feel and lyrics always pull me through.   The darker Cirez D stuff is nice to identify to while I'm angry and helps let me go through the emotions and let them go after."
ericprydz,39cf43,BrokeMike,2,Wed Jun 10 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"hey man. I was never like in despair like you were, but I did feel a little lost and empty. Listening to Eric, it made me feel good. Like something that was missing was filled. I dream about the cosmos and the vast universe, all to the sound of eric, particularly the Voices remix."
ericprydz,39cf43,Friday14,2,Thu Jun 11 04:05:49 2015 UTC,Eric's music has helped me through rough times as well. There's just something so uncynical about it--his pure love and knowledge of music comes through with his unwillingness to produce for the lowest common denominator and in the vast amount he produces across genres.
ericprydz,39cf43,cookiemonsta122,2,Thu Jun 11 04:11:07 2015 UTC,thanks for all the kind feedback.

ericprydz,397guh,tguidon,2,Tue Jun 9 20:25:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that sucks! I guess he wont upload the Original Mix on Spotify because Spotify isnt for DJs - its the same for Tether :x

ericprydz,396qv1,rag3fac3,2,Tue Jun 9 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Have fun bro. Let us know how the set is (assuming no live broadcast). Enjoy some Portillos as well, miss that place."
ericprydz,396qv1,Fold0rDie,3,Tue Jun 9 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I wish I could bring everyone with me haha"
ericprydz,396qv1,O_Shag_Hennessy,2,Tue Jun 9 19:53:03 2015 UTC,I'll be at the fest Friday. Would go to the after but I'll be at spring all weekend as well.
ericprydz,396qv1,O_Shag_Hennessy,2,Tue Jun 9 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"90% of the reason I'm going to the festival is for Prydz, so I couldn't pass him up at the Mid! Friday I'll be in Green LED Suspenders if you wanna try and find me :)"
ericprydz,396qv1,ihateturtlenecks,2,Tue Jun 9 19:52:31 2015 UTC,Word!! I'll keep an eye out. The only day I went to spring last year was Friday for Eric. My gf got me a three day pass for my b day this year. I'm pumped for Zeds dead Sunday!! A lot of amazing house/techno talent the last two days as well.
ericprydz,396qv1,irosedc,2,Wed Jun 10 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"yeah I've never seen Zeds Dead, pumped for them as well!"
ericprydz,396qv1,stepbacktakeaim,2,Wed Jun 10 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"No fest for me, but I'll be making my way to the mid after party Friday. Missed him last time he came through. Couldn't let that happen twice."

Edit: I try to update the playlist I made in the next couple of days. Edit2: Updated the list has more than 100 tracks in there now with cirez,prydz & tonja ID's, still not all if you miss sth just tell me and I can add it"
ericprydz,394maa,ABS20,5,Tue Jun 9 05:44:48 2015 UTC,I don't believe there to be any difference between this and the original mix. You may think it sounds different due to the quality of the mic being used to record this
ericprydz,38zyr4,danielsnelen,3,Mon Jun 8 06:23:45 2015 UTC,He played Snaz tonight.  So jelly.
ericprydz,38zyr4,djbayko,2,Mon Jun 8 07:24:34 2015 UTC,Is there a tracklist for last night's show?
ericprydz,38zyr4,mastercraft813,2,Mon Jun 8 14:34:19 2015 UTC,Id - id - id - id - id - id - id - id - id
ericprydz,38xvzl,Fold0rDie,4,Sun Jun 7 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"thanks for the upload foldordie really appreciate it, try to give ID's afaik them, first track is space miami intro id 2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6KlG1wJRg. 2nd is seadweller : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw2FOVYUiwU, played in epic radio 006.  The cirez d - Id was played in epic radio 011 here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cKa-sUk-jc. And the pryda - id after that is pryda - taxi id : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjDPKRJIJ0M."
ericprydz,38xvzl,PeteTongIDeal,4,Sun Jun 7 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks PTID, I'll make the edits. I am amazed at how you guys can identify all these IDs.  One of the amusing parts of the night was we met up a French fan and he kept trying to Shazam the songs. Oh man, poor guy, I told my buddy to text him the IDs and to come to Reddit."
ericprydz,38xvzl,PeteTongIDeal,2,Sun Jun 7 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"Haha its always funny to see people trying to shazam erics or jeremys tracks :D  I have a YT playlist for a lot of his tracks mostly pre 2013, and have listened to them like a trillion times so its easy sometimes to know which track is which etc."
ericprydz,38xvzl,coloco21,3,Sun Jun 7 22:08:24 2015 UTC,What you labelled as Shrine ID is actually Pryda - Space Miami 2015 ID  The On/Off he played is actually a mashup with Depeche Mode - Photographic (Acappella)  And Every Day is the Interlude Mix.  About Shrine: this is Shrine ID : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsB-EAMQU1k  This is Pryda Space Miami 2015 ID : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLKOxitTy38
ericprydz,38xvzl,coloco21,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can't keep track of all these IDs."
ericprydz,38xvzl,stepbacktakeaim,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Make sure to check the Wiki when you're done listening to every single Pryda/Mouseville release  http://www.reddit.com/r/ericprydz/wiki/index
ericprydz,38xvzl,TheUserIsYou,2,Sun Jun 7 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"Man, Taxi ID is my new joint. I hope he plays in it a recorded set so we get a better quality rip."
ericprydz,38xvzl,djbayko,2,Sun Jun 7 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"Love that track; such a groovy beat.  I saw him at Exchange LA back in March, and he too went into like a 20-30 min lull with some filler stuff, but built out of that, THEN transitioned right into the drop of Taxi ID. The energy picked up instantly and caught everyone by surprise. Such an amazing experience."
ericprydz,38xvzl,djbayko,2,Mon Jun 8 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's the thing I am adjusting to. I was with two others, one was a Prydz fan and one who was more into non-stop bangers. As I mature, I understand playing a bunch of high energy, big room BS isn't DJing (to each his own I know). The next day the non-Prydz fan came to the realization that Eric did a skillful job DJing by doing the transitional buildup to the final energy."
ericprydz,38xvzl,coloco21,2,Mon Jun 8 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"That ""filler"" was 2.5 hours of straight up Cirez D techno slayage.  Set of the year so far for me #YearOfTheMouse"
ericprydz,38xvzl,djbayko,2,Mon Jun 8 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry bruh, just not my cup of tea and I was referring to the two or three songs he played after Space Miami 2015 ID. Love me Cirez D, just not those particular ones. Where were you in the crowd?"
ericprydz,38q5xk,goobly_goo,3,Fri Jun 5 22:03:53 2015 UTC,I also immediately thought of Prydz shows when I read this.
ericprydz,38ndvz,djsquilz,7,Fri Jun 5 09:51:26 2015 UTC,"The kind of night you just described I think is the kind most of us here dream of. I'm so tired of seeing club sets in NYC with these over priced tix, over crowded clubs, bottle/booth rats, and bros acting a fool. Small town Pryda sounds damn good to me"
ericprydz,38ndvz,lolz_alot,2,Fri Jun 5 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Don't even need a small town, next time he's in DC at echostage make sure to attend. Its always worth it"
ericprydz,38ndvz,bbsix,2,Fri Jun 5 22:40:21 2015 UTC,Yeah but I'd hardly call Echostage intimate lol
ericprydz,38ndvz,lolz_alot,2,Sat Jun 6 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but Prydz never packs the place so you get huge production + sound, a little room to dance, and cool air!"
ericprydz,38ndvz,gtevans19,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but minus the blown sub :)"
ericprydz,38ndvz,djbayko,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Oh it was definitely kind of like that minus the over-crowding and over-priced tickets ($25, totally reasonable IMO). There were ""VIPs"" (who would never afford/get VIP at a club in NYC.) Plenty of bros who didn't seem to really know who they were seeing. The only other shows this year at this club are Steve Aoki and Adventure Club so a number of people came as they were looking for that. Small town is best when it's a small town venue that's not trying to act like a big town venue."
ericprydz,38ndvz,Bookling-,3,Fri Jun 5 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"Man, Im looking forward to Prydz at EDCLV the most since I discovered him last year at EDVC and Im crossing my fingers and praying to the rave gods that he plays his Turn Around bootleg. That would absolutely make my entire week/month/year."
ericprydz,38ndvz,joco77103,2,Fri Jun 5 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping for it, but it never came. The AME remix is one of my favorites in recent memory."
ericprydz,38ndvz,PiazzaDelivery,2,Fri Jun 5 20:59:13 2015 UTC,Let's go EDC!!
ericprydz,38ndvz,808Coug,2,Fri Jun 5 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"I've seen Prydz in both small and large settings and I mirror your sentiments exactly. Much in the way that a small classroom offers more one-on-one time between teacher and students, a small venue enhances the connection between artist and consumers.   The night I saw Prydz in such a capacity, the room held 80-90 people and I felt as though he was catering his set to me. The event was more than just music; he exposed the room to true artistic genius. It was like I was getting a personal, first-hand look at an artist at his most vulnerable, and at his very best.   That night, I experienced one of the strongest natural highs I ever have."
ericprydz,38ndvz,DOWDKR01,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:17:17 2015 UTC,I'm curious to when this intimate set was? Sounds amazing!
ericprydz,38ndvz,rag3fac3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's crazy! I would guess there were maybe 350 people at this show during peak time."
ericprydz,38ndvz,irosedc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:03:04 2015 UTC,What do ya mean! His sets in clubs are far superior to those he puts down at festivals :) I'm glad you got to enjoy Prydz for the first time in a club it's an amazing experience.
ericprydz,38ndvz,Open_Eye_Signal,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:47:22 2015 UTC,Haha most definitely. I'll take a club show over a festival any day.
ericprydz,38ndvz,pock89,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:01:33 2015 UTC,His festival sets are still pretty fucking good.
ericprydz,38ndvz,mef08d,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:05:31 2015 UTC,I'm seeing him at Spring Awakening! then heading straight to the club to see him at an Afterparty...so fucking excited!!!
ericprydz,38ndvz,noodleface4,2,Fri Jun 5 14:22:07 2015 UTC,me too!  left his 2013 NYE set at echostage early bc i was a pryda n00b and didnt know any better... then i witnessed his ultra set this past march and it was the greatest 90 mins of my life.  cant even put into words how excited i am for june 12.  he is hands down one of the best and most under appreciated artists out there...words do not do him justice.  cant wait.... <3
ericprydz,38ndvz,BrokeMike,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:31:25 2015 UTC,"Saw the wizard when he performed at The Mid earlier this year (where the afterparty is), it changed my life. I could barely speak for a day after that set."
ericprydz,38ndvz,BrokeMike,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"Good write up /u/djsquilz I agree...especially the part about the first 30 minutes to an hour on stage.   And the corny ass club.   I saw Prydz do his thing in Houston a few months ago. It was overall a much different experience, with me, personally preferring the Houston Setlist (Generate, Shrine ID,  Never Let Me Down Again Eric Prydz Remix)."
ericprydz,38ndvz,BrokeMike,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:50:06 2015 UTC,I'm seeing him tonight in a similar environment. I cannot wait.
ericprydz,38k70b,sixsixmusic,3,Thu Jun 4 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"Talked to him a week ago and he said they were coming back, not sure when though"
ericprydz,38k70b,Zicken,5,Thu Jun 4 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"And for the record, when he left the label, all his stuff was deleted off Beatport and he didn't know until people mentioned it to him.  We don't know the exact reason but..."
ericprydz,38k70b,atticus18244fsas,3,Thu Jun 4 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"He was talking about his contract being stupid and very limiting when it comes to releases. Eric doesnt really have that much to do with it, its his management, he is more distant from it from what I gathered. He said there wasnt bad blood between them, but he was disapointed that Eric didnt step forward to take more responsibility in order to change things."
ericprydz,38k70b,Zicken,2,Fri Jun 5 05:05:36 2015 UTC,what kind of speakers do you personally use for WAV and AIFF quality?

ericprydz,38k70b,djpeekz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:09:36 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with the m4a format because I never use it. It's definitely not lossless or even up to WAV/AIFF standards though.
ericprydz,38k70b,gtevans19,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:51:21 2015 UTC,"M4A = MPEG 4 Audio, MPEG being the compression type. It's more efficient than MP3 where quality to file size is concerned, but it's still a lossy compression, and if you're after the best quality there are better options."
ericprydz,38k70b,ababev26,0,Mon Jun 8 08:12:10 2015 UTC,"If you're serious about sound quality then a DAC is equally as important as speakers, IMO"
ericprydz,38gagv,atticus18244fsas,2,Thu Jun 4 00:42:11 2015 UTC,Thanks-- those were a fun watch.  What are you recording the audio with...just the camera?  Was very clear and not muffled.
ericprydz,38gagv,licorice_straw,3,Thu Jun 4 01:39:45 2015 UTC,iPhone 6.  Apple really stepped up their game with the mic.  Doesn't get overloaded by the bass anymore.  You can be standing beside a speaker and still get good sound.

ericprydz,38g5xh,The_Redmen,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:34:00 2015 UTC,I'm going to both Story and the Amp. Hoping Story is a 3 hour since they're open 10-5 and only have 2 other DJs that night. What time does the headliner usually come on at Story? Hopefully they're both doing a 2 hour set and Prydz is on from 12-3.
ericprydz,38g5xh,x3000gtx,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I have been to Story and usually I am pretty drunk, but I think the headliner usually comes out around 1. I thought they opened at 11, but if it's 12, I may have to head out slightly earlier just to avoid the chance of Prydz opening at 12. I mixed up the cities, but if he's just going to Tampa to end his four night run, maybe he will be on for 3 hours (at least I hope)."

ericprydz,38eixm,DOWDKR01,2,Fri Jun 5 05:07:04 2015 UTC,He will play 12-3 (maybe end a bit earlier than 3). Strap in because it's going to be a fucking ride and a half. Eric in the club >>>> Eric at a festival.
ericprydz,38eixm,djbayko,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with the consensus that club Eric is better than festival Eric.  The one thing to be aware of, however, is that you shouldn't expect the visuals to be quite as dynamic.  He doesn't usually bring his own gear to club shows, so you probably won't get the amazing laser show and will be limited to whatever equipment the club has in house.  Not that the visual aspect of the show will be bad or anything - I'm just conscious of the fact that you're coming from seeing him for the first time...at Ultra.  The journey he is able to take you on during a 2 to 4 hour set is worth it tho."

ericprydz,382ys8,zen279,7,Mon Jun 1 14:02:05 2015 UTC,Eric Prydz impresses me more in one hour more than most Producer/DJs do in their entire career.

ericprydz,382ys8,AreYouAfraidOfTheD,2,Tue Jun 2 00:13:59 2015 UTC,I believe he opened with Shrine ID which is not captured in the recording.
ericprydz,382ys8,glid699,2,Mon Jun 1 14:02:52 2015 UTC,Yes he definitely did. The set was almost entirely Cirez D except I think for the last song which was Generate.

ericprydz,37ufc1,noodleface4,2,Sun May 31 05:22:40 2015 UTC,He might show up with gigs with Eric cos he has not too different of a sound like Maceo Plex or Sasha but Kölsch has been singled to Kompakt since the start

ericprydz,37mr8i,TweetPoster,2,Thu May 28 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"Expecting the downvotes... But honestly I think Eric's music video are really dumb. They just seem like ways to market his music more which is fine, but IMO is not something worth hyping over. I mean yeah, they can be cool, but not that cool, and they don't appear to have significant meanings, really."
ericprydz,37mr8i,vulkkid,4,Thu May 28 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah, they can be cool, but not that cool, and they don't appear to have significant meanings, really.   Every dance music video ever, really"
ericprydz,37mr8i,djpeekz,2,Thu May 28 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Haha that's fair enough. Aphex Twin has had some mad videos though, but that's not as much dance.  Edit: damn I get downvoting the first one but how's this one bad at all haha"
ericprydz,37mr8i,vulkkid,2,Fri May 29 00:05:45 2015 UTC,i agree. i'm happy for him and his team but i don't particularly love his music for the videos. but rather all the feels i get

ericprydz,37eg7h,t3chnoshark,1 point,Wed May 27 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"Wait... Am I supposed to be mentally pronouncing this like ""pretenda"" as in pretender? Or is just a meaningless combo of 10 and pryda?"

After his ASOT set stole the show at Ultra, he delivered yet again. If the crowds weren't watching him, they will be now. Next up, EDCLV."

ericprydz,37851t,Synacku,2,Mon May 25 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if it's not on this site, then it's likely not recorded on the Internet at all.  Prydz EDC NY was posted here in like no time."

ericprydz,37851t,djbayko,1 point,Tue May 26 01:35:05 2015 UTC,it was all over soundcloud after i posted on the live discussion thread
ericprydz,37851t,gtevans19,1 point,Tue May 26 17:59:01 2015 UTC,True.  My point is that 1001tracklists is a great index of all mixes...on soundcloud or anywhere.  That's why I recommend people go there.  Bonus: You get a tracklist.
ericprydz,378ll5,zoel_jimmerman,12,Mon May 25 19:36:12 2015 UTC,Those two radio hosts are stupid as fuck
ericprydz,378ll5,t3chnoshark,5,Mon May 25 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"That one guy who said his release schedule was complicated is a complete dumbass. How is one EP per month, for three months prior to the release of the album complicated?"
ericprydz,378ll5,BowenMarsh,3,Tue May 26 01:07:00 2015 UTC,Seriously. They really made me cringe a couple times
ericprydz,378ll5,Meute,2,Mon May 25 22:50:11 2015 UTC,I find that with Sirius xm radio
ericprydz,378ll5,Mr_Flappy,3,Tue May 26 00:16:13 2015 UTC,Oh my god these interviewers are idiots...

ericprydz,376fyr,lurchh,5,Mon May 25 09:09:57 2015 UTC,"You make a good song, then YOU make it even better...how is that possible?"
ericprydz,376fyr,Chiddyz,3,Mon May 25 16:31:38 2015 UTC,Saw this dropped for the first time at EchoStage on Friday and the crowd went ballistic.. Same thing happened tn. Euphoric beyond belief.
ericprydz,376fyr,DOWDKR01,3,Mon May 25 14:07:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, the first time I listened through Mija and heard that sweet little one-off synth riff part-way through I immediately knew it could lead to something so much more special.  This is everything I dreamed and so much more."
ericprydz,376fyr,stepbacktakeaim,3,Mon May 25 16:52:50 2015 UTC,I am not even embarrassed to admit I got goosebumps when I heard it and a little wet in the eyes. Unreal.
ericprydz,376fyr,mwilbs,1 point,Mon May 25 19:00:11 2015 UTC,Still getting goosebumps on the 10th listen

ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,4,Mon May 25 01:49:56 2015 UTC,Yeah this was a pleasant surprise :)
ericprydz,375edi,Artrovian,6,Mon May 25 01:53:19 2015 UTC,Pleasant is definitely an understatement haha
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,5,Mon May 25 01:54:52 2015 UTC,"I thought he would end predictably with New City Gas ID and Tether, boy am I happy that I stayed up for this (4 am here right now)."
ericprydz,375edi,Artrovian,6,Mon May 25 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"i had a feeling he'd do something different here. more eyes on him after the ultra set, figured he'd unleash something big. did not disappoint!"

ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,2,Mon May 25 02:01:23 2015 UTC,Amazing track
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,3,Mon May 25 01:50:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely nuts. I can only imagine the crowd going apeshit to this
ericprydz,375edi,HCBT,1 point,Mon May 25 01:51:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like it has sample of this song. But It sounds that way just for me I guess...

ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,7,Mon May 25 03:55:50 2015 UTC,Love that he left us with these two tracks. sweet edit of mija
ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,7,Mon May 25 02:03:02 2015 UTC,I love how there's a community for this type of thing. Im strapped in for an hour of amazing music. I absolutely cannot wait to see him at EDCLV
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,3,Mon May 25 01:08:15 2015 UTC,I moved to California too late and missed his big 3 hour live set.  But I am seeing Olander in July!!
ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,3,Mon May 25 01:14:00 2015 UTC,Olander is going to playing in California? Where?
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,3,Mon May 25 01:15:00 2015 UTC,"By July I meant August.  Exchange LA.  And a ""secret show"" the night before.  Its on his facebook page"
ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,3,Mon May 25 01:19:07 2015 UTC,Ah damn. So-Cal gets the best shows haha
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,2,Mon May 25 01:19:44 2015 UTC,He announced a new tour the other day.  Haven't updated the sidebar with the dates yet.  https://www.facebook.com/jeremyolander/photos/a.10150644393033640.397467.44920763639/10153022654728640/?type=1
ericprydz,375edi,CossRooper,2,Mon May 25 01:17:22 2015 UTC,I sense a meetup.  haha
ericprydz,375edi,Artrovian,3,Mon May 25 01:20:55 2015 UTC,Maybe in SF haha

ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,5,Tue May 26 03:50:48 2015 UTC,I love that you still can hear the MSG ID02 synth in the background.
ericprydz,375edi,cirezdyrp,7,Mon May 25 01:13:16 2015 UTC,He had it playing/looping for the first 13 minutes!
ericprydz,375edi,uaedan,1 point,Mon May 25 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"I loved the Mija and EDCNY ID, but fuck.. the MSG ID02 loop was sexy!"
ericprydz,375edi,Cougah,4,Mon May 25 06:05:17 2015 UTC,Crowds lose their minds for that part of this track.  Every single time.  And I still get goosebumps when they do.  haha  2000 people on the dance floor
ericprydz,375edi,Bookling-,3,Mon May 25 01:17:18 2015 UTC,goosebumps boosegumps
ericprydz,375edi,lmanning33,4,Tue May 26 03:08:28 2015 UTC,oh wow! this is my new favourite
ericprydz,375edi,joco77103,6,Mon May 25 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"it sucks because last year we were wishing that he would do longer 2-4 hour sets, then he went and did it... a bunch of times and now we're spoiled. I see the 8 tracks and I'm like dang, that's nothing! but I'm sure the set was great (I chimed in too late to listen). I will be seeing him at Spring Awakening in Chicago. I'm just sure I will be LUCKY to get an hour and half. really hoping for that. last year he was only an hour :( and only the final headliner of each night got 1.5 hours. edit: and I didn't even make it in time for EDC NYC 2015 ID! :("
ericprydz,375edi,lmanning33,1 point,Mon May 25 01:59:46 2015 UTC,Im sure you can find a rip of it somewhere online. It was magical haha
ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,4,Mon May 25 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"Was fortunate enough to be there. It was amazing. Audio got fucked up first 3-4 minutes and it was just silence. He had his headphones on and didn't notice. Was pretty weird, but set was amazing. EDCNY15 id is special."
ericprydz,375edi,porksandwich9113,2,Mon May 25 04:45:35 2015 UTC,Obvi shitty re: the silence but also kind of amazing that he's so focused and in the zone. He sure made up for it..
ericprydz,375edi,uaedan,2,Tue May 26 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"No doubt. Was fantastic. I'd say it was more a sound guy error than an EP error, regardless. And like you said... He certainly made up for it."
ericprydz,375edi,whiskeyboarder,3,Tue May 26 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new to Prydz.  Didn't recognize the first track, but love this one."
ericprydz,375edi,Artrovian,3,Mon May 25 01:13:09 2015 UTC,Tracklist in the OP.  All ID's so far.

ericprydz,375edi,Dj-A-lash,3,Mon May 25 01:35:09 2015 UTC,I feel like there was a moment there that he just spun all his tracks into one chaotic mashup. lol.  I think I've been spun off the face of the earth
ericprydz,375edi,coloco21,3,Mon May 25 01:42:56 2015 UTC,Just got home so was unable to listen live - is anyone able to get a rip of this for download?

ericprydz,36wilv,PrydaSnare,2,Fri May 22 18:27:20 2015 UTC,If i lived around the area I would definitely have come but I live in Philly and because of my scheduled prescription times and the obvious no drugs allowed policy there's no way I think I can survive 4hours of pure pryda bliss while my mouth starts getting swollen and bloody.  I've been looking forward to this for weeks too.
ericprydz,36wp8o,nolan89,1 point,Fri May 22 19:12:53 2015 UTC,It wasn't released. It says not on label so it must be a bootleg.
ericprydz,36wigh,twobeees,9,Fri May 22 18:23:43 2015 UTC,No money. Lots of drugs tho
ericprydz,36wigh,coloco21,6,Fri May 22 21:21:10 2015 UTC,Space Miami 2013 prydz might play it...
ericprydz,36wigh,Natchz,4,Sat May 23 01:11:05 2015 UTC,I just don't think he ever will.. Where in the set do you guys think would be a good place to drop it?   IMO the best/only time would be the closing song. People would lose their shit and it's all anyone would talk about on the way out of the venue.

ericprydz,36wigh,evilabed23,2,Sat May 23 08:32:21 2015 UTC,he's never going to play it due to a grudge held about how the song was released and the music video.  it's a lot more personal than just trying to distance himself from the commerciality of it.  that being said I would lose my shit if I ever heard him play it
ericprydz,36wigh,lolz_alot,1 point,Sat May 23 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"He was playing some event somewhat recently where someone @'ed him on twitter and said ""If you play Call on Me I'm going to go streaking or somthing""  Hours later he twittered ""Streak to this"" I never followed up on it but I wondered if he actually did play it for that set or not."

ericprydz,36tun3,howgod,1 point,Fri May 22 18:17:28 2015 UTC,Odds are less than negative infinity I don't know why he hates that song it is honestly one of his best works and definitely his most successful.  But yes if he ever played it at a concert the crowd would erupt.

ericprydz,36e1zu,JimiSmyth,10,Mon May 18 17:30:34 2015 UTC,"I much prefer this to the original. That's probably a sign of how my tastes have changed and how upbeat happy music just cuts it less and less as I listen to electronic music more and more. Funny how that's the case, even with Prydz. Before I would have been all over generate but now I'm like please give me some melancholic Pryda or some really dark Cirez D. This kolsch track oozes melancholy and  restraint because he took out the ""It's the only thing that carries me on"" lyric, and those aspects of music appeal much more to me than when I started listening to Electronic Music."

ericprydz,360rxr,lurchh,1 point,Fri May 15 11:10:01 2015 UTC,"Hes being saying that for a while, and it has always been the plan. Hes been talking about having his own label for a while, I think that the end of this yr is potentially the time for it.   He has to at some stage step out of erics shadow (he already is well out from underneath for me). if I read the start of an interview with the preface ""eric prydz protege "" ever again I may massacre the journalist"

ericprydz,35zqya,coloco21,1 point,Fri May 15 19:20:49 2015 UTC,I think MSG ID2 might be my favorite Pryda song ever....
ericprydz,35zqya,coloco21,1 point,Sat May 16 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"You haven't listened to enough Pryda then haha, MSG ID2 is great but it still lacks some layers.  Go listen to Pete Tong ID, Shadows, Inspiration, Muranyi, Mirage, Vega, Agag, You, Leja, Europa, Aftermath and of course Allein. MSG ID2 got nothing on them imo"
ericprydz,35zqya,evilabed23,1 point,Sat May 16 03:13:45 2015 UTC,"There are so many good Pryda songs. For instance, I love many of the songs you've mentioned. Peter T ID is unreal. The thing is with me is that I just resonate with certain songs. I love most of Eric's songs. I love Shadows, it could be considered my all time fave, same with many more. But IDK, something about MSG ID 02. There's something about it.....when I listen to it...it makes me feel.....idk a combination of euphoria and just a feeling of truth, like  that it's the one real truth in the universe. Im going to listen to those songs because I haven't heard half of them in forever!"
ericprydz,35zqya,powermodule,1 point,Sat May 16 03:25:35 2015 UTC,"I just feel like MSG ID2 lacks something. It's got the melody and all but it's not quite complex enough for my taste. But of course, music taste is subjective ;)  Go listen to old IDs too, Sensation Belgium Intro ID, Use Somebody (EP Remix), Sing Sing ID1 and ID2, Connexion (not an ID), Kings of Prydzopolis (not an ID), In My Head, Seadweller 2005 (not an ID) and 2007, Grodan, From Within, Zombie Nation (Eric Prydz Remix), Tribute to Stockholm, Montreux Jazz ID, Sol, Clapham, Snaz, Warrior, Creamfields 2010 and 2011 ID..."

ericprydz,35v9fp,t3chnoshark,2,Wed May 13 20:17:53 2015 UTC,Sounds so fucking cool but I'm not sure how cool it will be to watch an event online that is stripped down as much as this. I'm hoping they use that rocky venue in the trailer. Looks insane! Will surely be bumping the four hour set for weeks to come anyway.
ericprydz,35v9fp,alejandroclark,2,Thu May 14 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"I dont know if Ill be watching per se, but ill definitely be tuning in live to listen to it. 4hrs of Olander is going to be infuckingsane"

ericprydz,35vgee,Dj-A-lash,6,Wed May 13 21:09:41 2015 UTC,I think we let Eric release what he wants to release
ericprydz,35vgee,djpeekz,3,Thu May 14 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"It's wonderful to see Eric hear his fans and release some of those amazing IDs. That said, I don't think there's any chance we can influence what will be on PR(10)DA. Eric has been doing ""what the fuck I want"" for his whole career; I hope he never changes."
ericprydz,35vgee,gtevans19,2,Thu May 14 01:48:56 2015 UTC,I think the tracklists are already done by now.  What I'm 75% sure will be released :   Creamfields 2011 ID One Day Pete Tong ID Snaz or Fabric Test or Queen Club Paris 2010 ID or Ambassadeur ID or Warfield ID
ericprydz,35vgee,coloco21,3,Wed May 13 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"I agree that Creamfields will probably be released, but I think it will be on the Eric Prydz album, not PR(10)DA. Edit: Hope Ambassadeur is on the Prydz album as well...it's not a Pryda track to my ears."
ericprydz,35vgee,gtevans19,2,Thu May 14 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"According to this amba is a prydz track https://soundcloud.com/eric-prydz/eric-prydz-presents-epic-radio-010, so expect to see this on the prydz album"
ericprydz,35vgee,PeteTongIDeal,3,Thu May 14 09:48:02 2015 UTC,"Pete Tong ID is definitely getting a release because even though Eric has really never seen it as something that dynamic or playable, the fan outcry for it has been massive for years. Fabric test and  Ambassadeur are also probably sure things. Warfield I highly doubt that shit is so basic a rookie producer could make it in a day"
ericprydz,35vgee,sunburst09,1 point,Thu May 14 03:45:45 2015 UTC,"upvoat, agree on the first and especially the last part"
ericprydz,35vgee,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Thu May 14 09:48:49 2015 UTC,Warfield is only because he played it a lot recently. I really dig the track tho.
ericprydz,35uyt7,stepbacktakeaim,4,Wed May 13 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"Shure SE215s for me, some of the best isolation and great sound quality, pretty cheap as well"
ericprydz,35uyt7,lurchh,1 point,Wed May 13 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"Shure earbuds are really good.  I have higher end ones for the enhanced bass, which is amazing, but they start to get pricey.  You get what you pay for."
ericprydz,35uyt7,djbayko,1 point,Wed May 13 21:17:22 2015 UTC,ill cast a vote for these..had em a while and ive yet to break them or get tired of their sound (and I compulsively buy personal listening equipment like a mf)
ericprydz,35uyt7,wwttdd,1 point,Thu May 14 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"I've got these as well and also love them, although after a few years now one of the connectors is getting a bit temperamental, sometimes one ear cuts out and I have to twist the cord a bit to get sound back. Apart from that, can't complain."
ericprydz,35uyt7,djpeekz,1 point,Thu May 14 05:17:51 2015 UTC,"These are a bit pricier than what I was looking for initially, but judging from what everyone's saying - and if they'll last a couple good years - I just might go with them."
ericprydz,35uyt7,coloco21,2,Fri May 15 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'm using Sennheiser CX-400 II and so far they've been pretty good durability-wise, but I guess they're only good for their price and you can find far better if you wish to put a bit more cash in."
ericprydz,35uyt7,t3chnoshark,1 point,Wed May 13 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"do you want high qualiy as in high audio quality? or quality made? i use bose sie2 heaphones for jogging and normal on the move to school/work for about 2 years these babies dont look like they will break anytime soon. sound is great but not that amazing, its hard to get good sound from earbuds."
ericprydz,35uyt7,t3chnoshark,1 point,Wed May 13 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"I guess both, but for earbuds I'll take great audio quality and amazing build over amazing audio quality and less-than-amazing build.  Durability is very important for me.  I have headphones for higher quality audio."
ericprydz,35uyt7,AreYouAfraidOfTheD,2,Wed May 13 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"i see you need it for the gym, i would recommend the bose sie2i's. comfy, wont fly out of your ear and good build. it doesnt feel like the jack or the wire will tear off the ends. That being said its the only pair ive bought (used to just use apple earpods)"
ericprydz,35nly9,Rumsies,8,Mon May 11 23:48:41 2015 UTC,Nobody likes Pryda -Storm here ?  An amazing progressive track.  Hear it at 2:17 Mix from 2006
ericprydz,35nly9,Thenzzo,2,Tue May 12 11:56:46 2015 UTC,"This is true Pryda, one of his very best. It sounds just as good still as it did all that time ago."
ericprydz,35nly9,Fly_Right,1 point,Wed May 13 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"JO played it in a more recent mix, quintessential Pryda IMO"

ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Tue May 12 16:14:39 2015 UTC,"Forgot about that, The opening of alfon reminds of that track a lot too actually, there's reconstruction here if you havn't seen it already. It's something at least https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaA8INmqJlg"
ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,3,Tue May 12 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"I think he will release the volumes after chronolgical order, so starting first vol with a track produced around 2004:  Vol 1: Grodan, in my head, gobal gathering id 2007, 4th track either, wowow or id from 2005  vol 2: snaz, pete tong id, capitol ID's  vol 3: both ID's played in epic radio 004, space miami intro id 2013, queen club paris 2010 id (privilege id)  To be honest, I just want pete tong id to get finally released hence my nick at this reddit. Other than that I'm fairly open to his unreleased tracks over the last couple of years, because he gathered so much of them, a lot of them played in epic radio, so we have some in good quality, maybe he'll release some gems he didnt play in epic radio like bussen, or the studio 88 id or sing sing.  Edit: @ Rumsies I really think that creamfields id will be on the upcoming album. I really would love to see a Tonja EP to get released, loco is an amazing track and I totally agree with you, after he'll drop the three volums, most people who doesnt know all of his unreleased gems will realize how great and how talented Eric is. I'm with you on this one T. ;)"
ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,3,Tue May 12 00:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah If there is one track I would bet that for certain would be there, it's creamfields. I think it's a perfect Pryda volume track actually rather than an album track. I hope it retains that name, would be a great name for a track. I really hope it gets released too. For as long as I've been checking this subreddit you've been posting with that name, and this is probably your best hope. Tbh I think any track that was promised a release will probably be on the vol, and I think Pete Tong was one of those. BTW do you have the radio show where Pete Tong first played it?"
ericprydz,35nly9,gtevans19,1 point,Tue May 12 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"Agree with you, creamfields will be either on the ep's or the album, has to be. And yeah think so, too, that the tracks he promised will will be on the ep's & the album.    I found this here on itunes http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/?id=206601272. Unfortunately I dont have itunes check it out should be the right one. Here is the tracklist http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/petetong/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20090130  Edit: Enjoy the ""secret weapon"" :D, which it really is"
ericprydz,35nly9,coloco21,1 point,Wed May 13 00:12:10 2015 UTC,Isn't Creamfields labeled as Eric Prydz - Untitled on one of the EPIC Radios? Related question: Has anyone seen a track (that wasn't re-released) switch from being labeled a Pryda track to an Eric Prydz track or vice versa?
ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,3,Thu May 14 02:01:53 2015 UTC,Don't forget One Day ;)  I seriously doubt Grodan and GG07 too. And Pete Tong ID would have to be reworked since Prydz doesn't like the build up.  Space Miami Intro 2013 wasn't played quite often enough to be in there imo. Fabric Test seems more likely.
ericprydz,35nly9,coloco21,2,Tue May 12 05:31:58 2015 UTC,"I would love to see one day getting released, NYE 2013 edition.   We will see about grodan.   If global isnt on one of they ep's it will be on the album, since their was no offical statement by Eric that the track is a pryda production.  Why does fabric test seems more likely to you ?"
ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,2,Tue May 12 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"Fabric test seems more likely because he played it a lot throughout the years since 2008 or earlier, I mean it's even in his RS mix...   Grodan is old and hasn't been played in a while to my knowledge. It also sounds quite dated imo.   GG07 was played at Verboten and that's about it... Not sure he even played it after 2009. It also does sound dated (even the breakdown).   You know what's more likely? Warfield ID. He played it a lot during his Generate Tour."
ericprydz,35nly9,coloco21,1 point,Tue May 12 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"Playing out a track a lot doesnt mean shit. He played wowow back in 2011 & 2010 a lot , never released it and I think there are other examples that disproof your statement.   Plus warfield ID never got an official tag, afaik, imo its a cirez, highly UNlikely to see on one of the ep's.  Yeah grodan is old, its from 2004, he hasnt played other tracks produced at that year more frequently has he ?"
ericprydz,35nly9,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Tue May 12 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'll release WOWOW too haha (ok maybe not).  Warfield didn't get a tag yet... but we haven't got an EPIC Radio in ages so that's probably why. Sounds more Pryda to me but it's debatable (GG07 also sounds like Cirez before the breakdown btw).  Well he played 2003 ID at one venue during the Generate Tour (probably Verboten) but that's no 2004. But who knows, it's probably not D.A.M.P. or his remix of Yazoo - Situation so it might even be one we never heard of. Or In My Head.  Or perhaps it doesn't start in 2004 and he just said this to commemorate the anniversary but he didn't mean he'd release a track from 2004.  Wait & See"

ericprydz,35nly9,evilabed23,3,Tue May 12 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"VOL VI (Tonja Holma EP) Not Pryda but Tonja deserves an EP because SHE really has some bombs, and I think trippleton just falls inside the time range of 2004 - end of 2014.     FTFY as Tonja is cirez d's grandma"

ericprydz,35nly9,evilabed23,2,Thu May 14 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I was thinking at least one of the EPs might focus more on his more recent IDs like Verboten ID, Shrine ID, Firestone ID, Exit ID, and Melbourne ID. Maybe those will be part of the album? Who knows but I'm dying for those tracks haha"
ericprydz,35nly9,coloco21,4,Thu May 14 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"mmh most of the ID's you mentioned are presumably cirez d tracks, highly unlikely to see one of those on the EP's, but definetly not impossible. Edit: Would like to see firestone, verboten  & exit to get a release"

I'm just dying for the chance to play around with more content of his in high fidelity. That will make the newly released material brand new for me in essence whether it's actually new or not.

I agree that we shouldn't bash Eric if we heard the ""new upcoming releases"", but also, he knows what he's doing, and he has done this for years...  And people will always bash, it's people. :D  I remember when he released Mija/Origins/Backdraft/Axis, we all heard most of it before, but I still loved it regardless..."
ericprydz,354mjy,qpb,2,Thu May 7 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"If anything, its awesome to (hopefully) get some of our favorite IDs in high quality! I'm sure nearly all of us have at least one. Hopefully he makes one of them a Cirez D (firestone) EP :D  With that in mind, I do hopes he has a few tracks up his sleeve. I'm really excited to see what Eric's album will be like. His vision and talent will be on full display."

ericprydz,354mjy,djpeekz,3,Thu May 7 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"It's probably also worth noting that the final released versions could differ slightly (or more) from what we've heard.  For example, both Generate and Liberate in their final released versions had added vocals that I hadn't heard in any set previously. Granted they aren't completely new mixes but given Eric's propensity to tweak the IDs, even if you know the tune well there could be a little something you haven't heard before."
ericprydz,354mjy,djbayko,2,Thu May 7 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I often find that I prefer the earlier versions.  They are more ""raw"", and even great electronic producers like Eric can sometimes over-think a track.  Some say the primary role of a record producer when working with a band is to tell them when it's good enough."

ericprydz,354mjy,zoel_jimmerman,2,Thu May 7 07:23:35 2015 UTC,It was so annoying over at r/deadmau5 seeing so many people complain about hearing most of the material before.  I for one am looking forward to getting alot of ID's that we have all wanted for years!

ericprydz,354mjy,evilabed23,1 point,Sat May 9 21:58:33 2015 UTC,I like this idea of viewing his music also. He'll make an edit just for one show. It's a journey of his musical ability and as fans we get to experience it with him live.
ericprydz,354mjy,boulderin,-3,Thu May 14 02:41:00 2015 UTC,Deadmau5's track are uninteresting and don't have the multitude of layers that a pryda track does. Released pryda always sounds so much better than rips. I'm hoping everything on Pr (10)da is shit I've heard before and then the prydz album is about half new half unreleased stuff

ericprydz,354mjy,cuminginside,4,Thu May 7 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"i'd argue deadmau5 is technically a better producer than Eric. Eric just makes the type of music that caters to my taste so I prefer him. He also understands the whole underground atmosphere a lot better than deadmau5, so I think he knows what he's going for. deadmau5 is a lot more creative in his work but seems to just make anything that comes to his mind."

ericprydz,34ubkd,coloco21,2,Mon May 4 18:48:07 2015 UTC,The earliest might be tracks such as:  Pryda - Grodan ID (2004) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Vn-WJr8KE   Pryda - Connexion (2005) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tgZynF-434  Pryda - In my head (made in 2005) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDg38Ag1I_k  The latest could be tracks such as:  Pryda - MSG ID01 (2014) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll7ePzY9034  Pryda - MSG ID02 (The Truth) (2014)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY3GtElR-S0   Pryda - Linked (NYE 2014) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo7eW61OqHE
ericprydz,34ubkd,Artrovian,3,Mon May 4 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"Earliest could also be D.A.M.P. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkcB0MvpNC8 or his remix of Yazoo - Situation, with or without Aftermath... for instance  Latest could also be Trippleton since he played it a lot or Shrine ID if he decides to put Cirez stuff in here. I guess his remix of Turn Around counts too."
ericprydz,34ubkd,coloco21,1 point,Mon May 4 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"Nice one, I'm not sure if I've ever heard D.A.M.P. before. I'm quite sure it'll just be unreleased Pryda tracks for PR(10)DA. Shrine ID will probably get a release sooner or later I guess, but the other two that you mention will probably never be released."
ericprydz,34ubkd,Artrovian,1 point,Mon May 4 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"Trippleton has been played since the end of 2014 and he really likes to play it as an Intro to his sets (well not at Verboten, his intro was Liam). Armed was his intro and it eventually got released so why not..."
ericprydz,34ubkd,SummerMadnessfi,2,Mon May 4 23:59:22 2015 UTC,"Because it's Tonja Holma, he hasn't released a track under that name yet (correct me if I'm wrong). Who knows eventually he might though...I hope I'm wrong and you're right, because I love Trippleton."

ericprydz,34ubkd,howgod,8,Mon May 4 17:51:47 2015 UTC,He's been writing it in his head for 10 years. We know how much music Eric makes. There are probably hundreds of songs nobody has ever heard.

ericprydz,34ubkd,howgod,4,Mon May 4 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of the unrelased tracks that we labeled as pryda could be actually prydz productions, tracks that havnt been played in epic radio , example is creamfields id & palladium id, lot of fans thought that creamfields was a pryda track and palladium a prydz, where both are actually the opposite, according to Eric"
ericprydz,34ubkd,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Mon May 4 20:42:07 2015 UTC,yeah I was thinking he could pull a fast one on us.. good to hear I'm not alone there.  and I totally would have guessed creamfields/pryda and palladium/prydz versus the opposite... he said that in a podcast or something?
ericprydz,34ubkd,gtevans19,1 point,Mon May 4 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"yes you can check epic radio 002 he himself marked creamfields as prydz, and palladium was played i think at epic radio 010 and marked as pryda"

Also Sasha's airdrawndagger I believe is considered one of the best progressive albums of all time, especially for 2002.

ericprydz,34ueo1,7rust,3,Mon May 4 17:41:04 2015 UTC,I doubt Bedtime Stories will ever be released since it's basically a rip off of this track (that's just my opinion) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4GXWwmOzV0 + it's a collaboration between him and Steve which makes it unlikely to appear on an Eric Prydz artist album (it's not called Eric Prydz and friends).

ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Mon May 4 19:03:06 2015 UTC,Just the ones that were first played on Epic Radio. I'm not sure what each ID got changed to based on the venue it was premiered.

ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,3,Mon May 4 19:28:35 2015 UTC,I think this'll be on the Eric Prydz artist album since it's been labelled as an Eric Prydz track =)
ericprydz,34ueo1,Artrovian,1 point,Mon May 4 18:41:53 2015 UTC,I second this. It feels more like Generate and Liberate. Definitely a peak time house banger. Guessing it will be in the LP.

ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,3,Mon May 4 18:42:11 2015 UTC,I'd love:   Ocean Drive  Creamfields ID01 New City Gas ID Ambassadeur ID UMF 2015 ID Privilege ID 2013
ericprydz,34ueo1,gtevans19,2,Mon May 4 18:43:39 2015 UTC,Creamfields and amba id will most likely be on the EP artist album
ericprydz,34ueo1,PrydaSnare,3,Mon May 4 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"Sure enough, the iTunes tracklist for EPIC Radio 002 says Eric Prydz - Untitled during Creamfields. I bet you're right!"
ericprydz,34ueo1,djbayko,1 point,Mon May 4 20:40:40 2015 UTC,He said through December 2014.. Sadly none of the new IDs from the Generate tour or Ultra will make it on the album :( still plenty of IDs to choose from though.
ericprydz,34ueo1,noodleface4,2,Mon May 4 18:55:04 2015 UTC,Good catch.  That just means none of the new IDs will be on the EP's though.  They could still be on the actual album!
ericprydz,34ueo1,PrydaSnare,1 point,Mon May 4 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  The tour was in 2015, but some of those tracks could have been produced and unreleased since 2014.  New City Gas and Exchange 04 seem like good Pryda candidates."
ericprydz,34ueo1,gtevans19,1 point,Tue May 5 01:32:05 2015 UTC,So no Shrine ID? That's a shame. I hope we get Firestone tho
ericprydz,34ueo1,meetyoni,3,Tue May 5 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"I think we all agreed in here that Shrine is a Cirez song? But it was premiered on New Years 2014, so there's still a small Glimma of hope ;)  Realistically, I think the only way we get that track is if he does a Cirez D release. Which is looking like 2016 after this huge announcement."
ericprydz,34ueo1,Artrovian,3,Tue May 5 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen comments from three different users (including myself - two comments that I didn't delete, parent still in tact) disappear from this thread...are they getting lost in the high traffic or is this thread being cleaned somehow (I don't even know if this is possible, just confused...)?"
ericprydz,34ueo1,chillygoose,2,Mon May 4 22:13:49 2015 UTC,Would this include cirez d goodies?
ericprydz,34ueo1,mystikalghost,3,Mon May 4 18:07:42 2015 UTC,It's called PR(10)DA for a reason I guess...and the Eric Prydz artist album is not likely to hold any Cirez D tracks either.
ericprydz,34ueo1,dylancherry,1 point,Mon May 4 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"Im hoping there is a Cirez EP, Pryda EP then either a straight prydz EP or mix of the 3"

ericprydz,34ueo1,cthom412,2,Wed May 6 09:12:35 2015 UTC,Any chance that Every Day (Private Remix) will be on here?
ericprydz,34ueo1,gtevans19,2,Mon May 4 20:05:52 2015 UTC,In my opinion there is no chance. The original Every Day cannot be found anywhere in release form - sample copyright issues from what I've heard.
ericprydz,34ueo1,cthom412,2,Mon May 4 20:49:55 2015 UTC,There's been speculation that it was a cleared sample but it got taken down because Fehrplay had a remix on it.

ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Mon May 4 22:09:15 2015 UTC,Yeah. I have no clue if there's any truth to it though.

ericprydz,34ueo1,mystikalghost,1 point,Mon May 4 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"i might be completely wrong, but i reckon this release is to finally get rid of some of his tracks he's been sitting on for ten years (probably to shut us lot up), i don't get the impression its to release his newer edits etc. After all he can do that whenever. I believe he's using this as a mile stone to release some special tracks we've been waiting for, for a very long time. Or i could be very wrong."

ericprydz,34ueo1,Artrovian,3,Mon May 4 17:51:59 2015 UTC,"Serious boosegumps from that, sounds weirdly like New City Gas ID in a way"
ericprydz,34ueo1,gtevans19,1 point,Mon May 4 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"Does it mean anything that it's going to be an ""Eric Prydz"" album rather than a Pryda album?"
ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,2,Mon May 4 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"Well it's probably going to be more mainstream, which means more vocals and probably a lot brighter/more uplifting/easier songs to listen to and not as progressive as PR(10)DA will be."
ericprydz,34ueo1,Artrovian,1 point,Mon May 4 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I could see it being a mix of his more mainstream Eric Prydz stuff, and also some progressive Pryda stuff.  Much like his live sets."
ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Mon May 4 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"I think this definitely means something. I'm expecting a full Eric Prydz album with tracks that have the flavor of 2night, Generate, One Day, Every Day, etc. etc. Not expecting any Pryda on it but we'll have to see!"
ericprydz,34ueo1,Allein_aLiam,0,Mon May 4 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"One day is a pryda track. Maybe he  adds pryda tracks filled with lyrics like palladium id to fit the ""mainstream needs"""
ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,2,Mon May 4 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"He listed Generate (back when it was known as Aragon ID) as a Pryda track here: https://soundcloud.com/eric-prydz/eric-prydz-presents-epic-radio-011 The vocals sure had a lot to do with the transformation of Generate/Aragon ID but I wouldn't be surprised if for instance One Day and/or Palladium ID would prove to be Eric Prydz tracks, they just have that Eric Prydz feel all over them."
ericprydz,34ueo1,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Tue May 5 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"hope not if he adds vocals to one day, gonna stop listening to his music, you can quote me on that mate edit: agree with palladium having the prydz feel , but one day is a 100 % pryda but thats just me"
ericprydz,34ueo1,evilabed23,1 point,Tue May 5 00:49:22 2015 UTC,One Day could easily be an Eric Prydz track.  nothing is official until he releases it imo
ericprydz,34ueo1,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Mon May 4 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"made he gave the tracklist for one of his sets, it was essential mix ithink where it was marked as pryda .

ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Tue May 5 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know about that, just saying if it's not released it's not official.  didn't Pjanoo change from being Pryda to being EP? edit: Generate too"
ericprydz,34ueo1,Artrovian,1 point,Tue May 5 03:00:51 2015 UTC,Im 99% sure that Pjanoo was originally released on Pryda Rec as a Pryda track and then released on MoS or Data or one of those as Eric Prydz
ericprydz,34ueo1,Thezenko,1 point,Tue May 5 03:17:44 2015 UTC,yeah exactly things can change.  the 'Eric Prydz' release moniker is purely a marketing thing
ericprydz,34ueo1,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Tue May 5 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"you are right it could change, but I hope he doesnt add vocals to one day, that would be devastating :(, dont know about pjanoo, yeah it was known as aragon id before he added the vocals, would prefer an instrumental version over a vocal tbh"
ericprydz,34ueo1,meetyoni,2,Tue May 5 12:13:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll add vocals to One Day, simply because it just doesn't need it. It still has that vocal sample singing ""One day we'll all be free"" or something and I think that's perfect. As I said earlier, I wouldn't be surprised if he changed it into an Eric Prydz track anyway without altering the track."

ericprydz,34j6hw,fredomau5,8,Sat May 2 05:01:44 2015 UTC,Really hoping for Epic 4K LA!
ericprydz,34j6hw,joco77103,4,Fri May 1 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's the album. A rule in the industry is to drop the album, then the tour. Needless to say, I'm excited. Hopefully he does it through EPIC Radio 14."
ericprydz,34j6hw,dukenuk3m,6,Fri May 1 17:26:41 2015 UTC,shouldn't he have dropped his album before he embarked on his club tour then?
ericprydz,34j6hw,sharkwithlaserz,7,Fri May 1 18:32:21 2015 UTC,"A club your is much different. He is only lugging around 4 USB sticks, not one of the most complicated visual setups in music.   Secondly, the club tour was most likely meant as a way to crowd test and tweak tracks. We saw 3 different versions of Shrine. The finalization of Generate and a ton more IDs.   Eric strikes me as a serious guy, who does things with a purpose. He will drop the album, build hype then drop 4K and use that to support the album. Since he controls everything except physical distribution of his music, he has a lot of money to make.   Then subsequently loose with 4K. Since he usually runs the shows at a loss."
ericprydz,34j6hw,djbayko,3,Fri May 1 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"Some pretty sound logic here, this makes sense. Do you think he's going to do a full tour for EPIC 4.0 though? I remember the EPIC 2.0 tour only had 4 nights, with two of them being back to back in the same venue, so a full tour would be a huge expansion on that. Honestly as long as he brings the show to LA I'll be happy, which seems pretty likely since he lives here and we got an EPIC 2.0 show at the Palladium."
ericprydz,34j6hw,Allein_aLiam,5,Fri May 1 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"Why can't the big announcement be both the album and corresponding tour?  I mean, you have to admit, the concert lights behind him in the picture, as well as the recent flow of holographic picture posts, seem very suspicious,"
ericprydz,34j6hw,Allein_aLiam,5,Fri May 1 21:24:57 2015 UTC,pretty sure Eric does not give one fuck about industry rules
ericprydz,34j6hw,Artrovian,1 point,Fri May 1 20:23:13 2015 UTC,He still conforms to the norms. Mitigate losses. I've had this discussion with him before. Sometimes things work certain ways for a reason.   Tour to promote the album. Not release an album to promote the tour.
ericprydz,34j6hw,PeteTongIDeal,1 point,Fri May 1 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"once the album is released it will promote itself.  you're right that the tour will ""promote"" (read: build hype for) the release of an album.  it's well known that EPIC shows lose him money even when the venue is slammed.  there's no reason to use the release of an album to promote EPIC.  Eric does things his own way, and I believe he'll continue to do so regardless of his recent rise in America.  I think it's wishful thinking to conclude that this photo has anything to do with the announcement of an album release.  but I guess we'll find out on Monday :)"
ericprydz,34j6hw,gypsybacon,3,Fri May 1 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"If this isn't the album and if he doesn't give us any info about the album through this announcement I'm gonna be really disappointed. I mean wtf... it's been over a year or so since he first mentioned ""Pryda 10"" or whatever he called it back then which means that was even before EPIC 3.0 was announced. For me it would be completely illogical if he'd do another EPIC before the album. And what was all that ""finally"" stuff he tweeted about this week? That can't have something to do with another EPIC since the last EPIC was so very recently..."

ericprydz,34b394,Johan_Prih,2,Wed Apr 29 19:01:36 2015 UTC,That was pretty cool. Anybody got advice on where to start with fehrplay tracks/sets?
ericprydz,34b394,Nitrocide,2,Thu Apr 30 10:45:25 2015 UTC,"Just start with his Pryda Friends releases like Phantom, Incognito, Runaway,Indigo, I can't stop it and his remix of everyday. Then his more recent releases such as Pyara, Ratatta, Pandora, Lotus and Renegade which is being released soon. He has plenty of other bombs then like his remix of Sordid Affair, The Reward Is Cheese remix, 2 People, Ayita.  Check out his Evolution Mix and his Residance mix aswell, really well mixed with some great tracks."
ericprydz,34b394,lurchh,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:30:13 2015 UTC,Fehrplay's soundcloud would be a best place to start. Full of his released tracks & sets. Also checkout his another alias Moffe if you are into techno.

ericprydz,345hzg,Thenzzo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:36:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, this is the bootleg he made with Muranyi, if you listen to the drop, it samples like the actual drop of the original Personal Jeses by Depeche Mode, the Muranyi melody is just added in. Its not just an acapella. It's an entirely different track to the Personal Jesus track Eric released. It's actually better in my opinion."

ericprydz,33xw4x,ABS20,3,Sun Apr 26 18:12:59 2015 UTC,he played it in the 2015 Essential Mix.  idk how many times he played it on the Identity circuit but it was premiered around then.  maybe your vid.  so it's known as Cirez D - ID1 (Essential Mix 2015)  or Cirez D - Identity Fest ID  ironic.....it's literally the ID ID haha
ericprydz,33xw4x,Allein_aLiam,2,Sun Apr 26 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"Let's call it identity id, essential mix id number is just confusing"

ericprydz,33xw4x,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"I think naming tracks by fans brings more confusion that ID names.

ericprydz,33xw4x,0123012,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:56:18 2015 UTC,"I guess....to me a name is a name is a name.  it's just as confusing to attach an ""ID"" name to a track then have to change, for instance I still think ""Mambo"" in my head when I hear Axis.  anyway I found out people called this track 'Emo ID' back in the day since there was a video from Emo's East in Austin that circulated.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U88d9dJ_U&feature=youtu.be"

Met Olander, Eric's tour manager and Eric briefly as he was finishing and got a couple of records signed. It was probably the smallest club/crowd that Eric had played to in a while so totally understood he wasn't feeling the vibe, but he was cool none the less. Got to chat to Olander for a while during Eric's set and he was really cool as well, very genuine and happy to chat about whatever. Eric's manager was thankful I could play after him at short notice and was cool as well :)"

Since then the dominant genres are not crowds where you get a lot of crossover for fans of Eric's sound, so with a limited fan base to work with from the start, that was one of the factors. The club has a legal capacity of under 1000 as well, and it was also the night before Eric, Jeremy and Fehrplay played a very large music festival in Sydney the next day, which always draws a lot of people from Canberra for the weekend."

ericprydz,33tse5,Nitrocide,5,Sat Apr 25 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"I know this is going to sound like heresy but most of his sets are pretty similar in structure and song choice. Opens with Prydz or Pryda, on a lighter note, things get darker around the 20 minute mark. An hour into it, he drops one of his melt-your-face songs. Again, he does this around the 3/4 mark. Finished with two or three mainstream Prydz or Prydz tracks. The middle is filled with Cirez D. songs.  I'd say look up his older sets, pre-2012. Also, have you heard his podcasts?"

ericprydz,33brf3,theweakened,10,Tue Apr 21 06:15:30 2015 UTC,"Production wise, festivals. Length & quality of setlist, club setting."
ericprydz,33brf3,delinquentz,8,Tue Apr 21 06:50:18 2015 UTC,Generally Yea but this years ultra set was something else.
ericprydz,33brf3,qpb,3,Tue Apr 21 07:01:49 2015 UTC,I always love his Ultra sets!
ericprydz,33brf3,delinquentz,2,Tue Apr 21 07:07:04 2015 UTC,"Eric's side of the production is just as good in the clubs. He brings his incredible Pryda visuals everywhere, it's all about the production in the specific venue.  Edit: The production in the venue determines what visuals Eric will be able to use. For example, Echostage (5/22) has lazers, C02 cannons, and walls of LED screens. Pair this with the music of a club set and you have the best of both worlds. Soundstage, ONE of the Generate tour venues, had no screens and no lazers, just some cool blinky lights - but the music was more than good enough to make up for it. If you really care about visuals, find a show at a venue with a lot of production. The bottom line is: Eric Prydz + Club Set = Go!"
ericprydz,33brf3,gtevans19,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, it depends on the venue.  a lot of the Generate tour venues were very basic"
ericprydz,33brf3,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:53:54 2015 UTC,I should've said Eric's team has his visuals wherever he's going...whether he is able to use them depends on the production of that specific venue.
ericprydz,33brf3,gtevans19,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"that's the goal, but it's not what ends up happening.  Liam was only on like 2 or 3 dates of the Generate tour.  probably because the clubs had those terms on booking"
ericprydz,33brf3,Allein_aLiam,5,Tue Apr 21 20:10:59 2015 UTC,"Club>>>>>festival  Sound is generally better, and if u are going to listen to music that's what's most important. My eyes are generally rolling into the back of my headache (a weird reflex from the days when I used to do drugs), so visuals do nothing for me and most clubs have at least a strobe.  Eric is also a lot more loose in a club and will play pretty much whatever the fuck he wants. His festival sets (prior to umf this year) pretty much just drew from the same 20 tracks"
ericprydz,33brf3,evilabed23,3,Tue Apr 21 08:58:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about what you meant with ""My eyes are generally rolling into the back of my headache"". Would you mind elaborating?"

When you only have an 1-1.5 hours to play, his ""last 30 minutes of cheese"" (Everyday, Liberate, Generate, MK ID etc) takes up a huge chunk of the set.  Eric belongs in a club with at least 2 hours to play."

ericprydz,33brf3,gnielson,4,Tue Apr 21 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"I really strongly recommend you check it out. As a few other fans have said expect a longer, higher quality set, and depending on the club you may still get lasers or cool visuals.   Personally my favourite time to see Eric is for festival afterparty sets. His digital dreams afterparty set in Toronto last year was the best show I've ever seen."
ericprydz,33brf3,DOWDKR01,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:34:20 2015 UTC,I was at that show and dear god it was unreal. Especially considering how great the crowd was at respecting each other's space.
ericprydz,33brf3,gnielson,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:37:46 2015 UTC,Definitely. It helped that all the muggles were next door watching Tiesto
ericprydz,33brf3,DOWDKR01,2,Tue Apr 21 19:52:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.Tiesto was good for something for once!
ericprydz,33brf3,Allein_aLiam,4,Tue Apr 21 21:10:27 2015 UTC,"as you get more into Prydz you will realize the visuals are not that important.  club Prydz is 10x better than festival Prydz.  the set will be at least twice as long, and he'll play much more rare material.  as others have mentioned, his festival sets tend to be somewhat predictable"
ericprydz,33brf3,YAYYYwork,2,Tue Apr 21 13:53:12 2015 UTC,Aside from EPIC. Visuals are awesome there
ericprydz,33brf3,Allein_aLiam,2,Tue Apr 21 14:53:17 2015 UTC,true...but music is above all else for me.  if I could see 2 more club shows I'd trade that over the next EPIC for sure

ericprydz,33brf3,lansa_cohetes,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:40:40 2015 UTC,It stuck with me BUT you know if you've seen him at a Fest. Or in some nasty delicious club that he's completely different!  Best example for me was that I got to see him in Waterloo (insane Pryda feels all night with mandatory Cirez darkness) At some cheesy nightclub and then saw him at Digital Dreams the same weekend. Honestly... Hardly worth seeing him at a festival when you know what he's actually about IMHO.
ericprydz,33brf3,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:00:49 2015 UTC,"haha there's not many acts I'd choose over Prydz at a festival...he can still lay it down when he wants to, Ultra this year being a good example"

ericprydz,33brf3,d4rkwolf1939,2,Tue Apr 21 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Seen him in a club set and festival set, and I liked his club set better. It had a more creative flow, didn't feel rushed, and was an incredible experience. If you've not seen him in a club set before, you should totally go. I'll be at that show as well, and am absolutely looking forward to it!"
ericprydz,33brf3,gtevans19,2,Tue Apr 21 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"Bigger ""clubs"" with great production (screens, lazers, etc.) will give you the best of both worlds. I'm not sure what The Ampitheatre is like, but some venues really do combine quality sound with festival-level production. I suspect there is very little production-wise that changes between club sets and festival sets on Eric's end. However, his music is infinitely better in the club - so hopefully attending this show is a no-brainer for you. Enjoy!"

ericprydz,334tpx,money2631,13,Sun Apr 19 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"Fehrplay's sound has always had the Pryda flair which makes sense considering he was on the label (the same goes for Jeremy's sound).  Just look at a track like Phantom.  I'd actually lean towards his style changing over the last year to a more deep sound and less Pryda-ish.  He's even created Moffe to explore that even more. Eric definitely didn't ""teach"" him how to produce at all.  Jeremy's sound has also evolved to a more techno-ish style too.  Both are branching out more and more.  Jeremy is even putting out stuff on different labels now too.    Long story short there's no way anyone can spin this and make Jonas look like the bad guy unless you know the full story.  In my eyes Eric was holding him back and he seems much happier releasing on multiple labels currently.  Plus it's better for his popularity.  How many people knew Fehrplay back when he was on Pryda Friends?  How many people know Fehrplay now that he's released on Anjuna, mau5trap and Ultra.  I would have done the exact same thing as him."

ericprydz,334tpx,BrokeMike,3,Mon Apr 20 06:38:28 2015 UTC,"I think the tracks he's putting out now are definitely still his distinct style, Eric's still sound different. Besides, he probably started most of his recently released tracks when he was still with Pryda Friends"
ericprydz,334tpx,lurchh,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"""lately his songs sound exactly like Eric's"" - NO ONE sounds EXACTLY like Prydz.

ericprydz,334tpx,FailRob,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with what others have said. I think his personal sound has gone further from the Pryda sound since leaving, and I think the tracks that make me feel that way were started before he left (or was forced to leave), and I feel like they probably have a lot to do with why he left. He started going in a direction that didn't fit with the label. It's interesting that you mark Lotus as having a Pryda sound. For me, that was the moment when I stopped and said, ""Wow, he's really changed his sound a lot."""
ericprydz,334tpx,Hsonlarsson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"Lotus feels soul less without any real ""heart"" and something you could put together easy in a few hours. This kind of sound/track is not my cup of tea at all."
ericprydz,334tpx,darkzavage,0,Sun Apr 19 19:41:48 2015 UTC,the stuff he was releasing on Pryda Friends seemed unique and really well produced. I've definitely noticed a decrease in the quality of production since Eric isn't on quality control duty
ericprydz,334tpx,atticus18244fsas,4,Sun Apr 19 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Jonas has been on this sub and I don't know if he still visits (doubtful).  But imagine coming on and seeing a topic like this about yourself.  I'm not saying we always have to be positive but like damn don't say Jonas learned to produce from Prydz.  Prydz would have never took Jonas under his wing if he wasn't skilled to begin with.
ericprydz,334tpx,evilabed23,0,Sun Apr 19 22:45:54 2015 UTC,Only the Lonely remix too
ericprydz,334tpx,milky27,3,Sun Apr 19 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"This track is my least favorite thing he's ever done (after all by myself, but that was free). Hes got some sick shit line up tho, like renegade and the two moffe tracks on soundcloud  (neither of which sound anything like what eric would touch).  In terms of tracks hes released post-pryf: Pyara was a very fehrplay track, would probably group it with incognito and indigo in terms of sound. Everywhere you go was definitely not a prydz track. Lotus I can see where u r coming from, also pretty sure that one was signed to pryda friends prior to the breakup. The royksopp remix I haven't listened to enough because maceo plex just smashed it out of the park with that one. Pandora doesn't sound like eric, and rattata has that classic  fehrplay breakdown. Maybe the synths are similar, but then they probably both occasionally use the same synths. I don't really feel like fehrplay has changed his style since departing the label, and I don't really feel like he should have too. He made pryda sounding tracks on the label (like phantom, aka the reason he got signed in the first place) and he will in yrs to come  Tl;Dr I'm rambling"
ericprydz,334tpx,Hsonlarsson,-3,Sun Apr 19 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"He's good, but there's loads of producers who are good. This guy was being bunched with Jeremy Olander a few years ago. The difference between them now is outrageous. Jeremy has come on leaps and bounds, Fehrplay is stuck in a rut."

ericprydz,32vbbs,evilabed23,2,Fri Apr 17 00:33:39 2015 UTC,This EP is shaping up to be my favourite Jeremy Olander EP of all time. Bayhert is just so so good and we've been waiting forever to hear it released. When he played Bayhert in vivrant radio 003 I couldn't stop skipping to that part. All I need now is Dhillon - The Heist and Love Flight and I would be so so happy.
ericprydz,32vbbs,Rumsies,2,Fri Apr 17 11:27:05 2015 UTC,"I have a good feeling we will get The Heist this year, if theres a Dhillon EP it will 110% be on it. Love Flight may just forever be unreleased sadly.. FUCK YOU STEVIE WONDER!!!!!!!!!!!"

ericprydz,32vbbs,zerokul175,2,Sat Apr 18 03:01:17 2015 UTC,He picked the right name for this song.. jeez what a grooving melody. My favorite Dj next to Prydz.
ericprydz,32vxpc,mikeobs,4,Fri Apr 17 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"Obviously the main part is saying ""I take you"", but as to what that other voice over is saying I really have no idea. This sounds to me like the gift, where people for years have been debating what the lyric says but it's really just a musical sound and what it says is not important. If it was important it would be clearer to hear. I know this is not a satisfactory answer and I do still want to know too, but until it maybe gets released or you can hear it live it will be hard to guess."
ericprydz,32vxpc,Rumsies,3,Fri Apr 17 11:20:45 2015 UTC,"The vocal sample in The Gift is ""Give it away, go somewhere.""  I made a thread about this about a year back and someone remembered Eric answering the same question on the old forum."

ericprydz,32w2gw,evilabed23,-1,Fri Apr 17 09:50:40 2015 UTC,"twitter, from a little dig by eric against Hot Since 82 for sampling Teaser in ne of HS82's tracks.  unless tribute to Stockholm sampled from the same source material as this remix by maceo / maetrik, I'd say the same applies as far as some liberal use of eric's fx from older tracks?  curious to see if anyone else noticed"
ericprydz,32rch1,Parker3d,11,Thu Apr 16 02:21:10 2015 UTC,"Welp the album ""Eric Prydz presents Pryda"" is what got me into Prydz so I'd say start with that... then download the whole Pryda catalogue (His post-2012 stuff first).   Then download his Eric Prydz productions and his Eric Prydz remixes (best ones are probably Circles, Not Going Home, Personal Jesus, Take me With You, Midnight City).  If you like techno you can try Cirez D (listen to Glow, Bauerpost, Drums in the Deep, On/Off, Mokba...).   Once you've got his whole catalogue you're going to listen to his sets and his unreleased stuff.  Best sets to start with are Mambo 2006, Brixton 2011 and his 2013 Essential Mix.  Best IDs to start with are the good quality ones like One Day, Fabric Test, Tear Shit Up, EXIT 2013 ID, his remix of The Arrival by Williams, EPIC Radio 006 ID, Ambassadeur ID, Creamfields ID...  Then you'll listen to his low quality IDs that were recorded live like Global Gathering 2007 ID, his remix of Zombie Nation, Bootshaus 2012 ID, Capitol ID2...  You can also listen to his really old stuff on his other aliases like Moo, Sheridan, A&P, Axer, Hardform...  You have a year ahead of you know :)"
ericprydz,32rch1,coloco21,-1,Thu Apr 16 05:28:52 2015 UTC,"right, so your going to tell him what to listen to but leave out the best stuff? I think your forgetting that some of his first releases on Pryda is some of his best work. Sucker DJ, NILE, SPOOKS, ect. His remix of Voices is the best song of all time IMO. AS far as mixes, he should check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amcv3EG_t-o, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9TcP7-U50M, along with the 07 essential mix."
ericprydz,32rch1,BrokeMike,10,Mon Apr 20 07:09:23 2015 UTC,Opens filing cabinet.  Here are some past posts that I've made regarding similar questions which have lots of links to his music accross all his monikers;   Replying to a confused deadmau5 fan (Important to read if you like deadmau5) Replying in that same thread to when I was asked my top three tracks Talking about the state of progressive house and beatport (Some good links to some of Erics tracks and  progressive house artists outside of Eric) Basically talking about Techno and Cirez D  More Cirez D talk Explaining all the different monikers of Eric Prydz to someone An answer to a similar question containing even more links to sets etc(Some posts of those already here so ignore those)   Mainly the point of posting these is just to give you super super easy access to a shitload of his music. Some of which is difficult to come accross. Reading back on these I realise I talk a lot of shite so ignore the wordy parts if you want and just make those links turn purple! I think I have even more posts way back in my timeline but these should tide you over for now.

Eric Prydz material under his actual name are usually reserved for his big hits that appeal to the masses like Everyday, Generate, Liberate, Tether remix, etc."
ericprydz,32rch1,LYD2Z,4,Thu Apr 16 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"Personal Favorites for me under Pryda - 2nite, Allein, Evouh, Genesis, Niton  Cirez D - Glow  All of his IDs :)"
ericprydz,32rch1,LYD2Z,3,Thu Apr 16 03:11:05 2015 UTC,upvote for Evouh...it's highly underrated IMO and I've yet to hear him play it in a set.

ericprydz,32rch1,lansa_cohetes,5,Mon Apr 20 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"This song should change your life, Faithless- Insomnia/Not going Home prydz rmx, as should this one, Mighty Love, followed by this one, In and Out Prydz rmx, and finally this one, Cirez D - Mobka  These are four of my favorite songs from his different types of work he does. They represent the vast capabilities of Prydz as a producer. He makes so much music it's nearly impossible to keep track of it all, and its so diverse and different that it's hard to get a proper sample of his skills without becoming a superfan.   Welcome to the club."
ericprydz,32rch1,loveandrave,2,Thu Apr 16 14:08:21 2015 UTC,personally prefer the regular Not Going Home (Eric Prydz remix) without the Insomnia bootleg.  first track I ever heard him play live :)  edit - life change confirmed
ericprydz,32rch1,Allein_aLiam,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"I know Im in the minority, but I think Not Going Home vs. Insomnia would sound better with the Andrew Rayel Remix part instead."

Then id send you some criez d like hoodpecker, lollipop and teaser which u may be familiar with and i could go a little further back but those tracks probably wont suit you. Then i would start getting into the new stuff and last album. Or you can disregard this whole comment and go to the wiki on the sidebar which goes by release date and has many unreleased tracks"

ericprydz,32rch1,Otsel7,3,Mon Apr 20 07:12:10 2015 UTC,I highly recommend starting with the Eric Prydz Presents Pryda. It is essentially a summary of the first 8 years of his Pryda alias and has most of the tracks he made under Pryda during that time. It's the album that originally got me into Prydz and I still listen to it all the time.  From there you should branch out into his other singles and sets such as the 2013 Essential Mix. You can find many of his sets on his Soundcloud.
ericprydz,32rch1,7rust,3,Thu Apr 16 06:33:46 2015 UTC,haha! Nice to see that you changed your flair to Pjanno - the track every Prydz newcomer knows first :D
ericprydz,32rch1,Allein_aLiam,3,Thu Apr 16 13:06:58 2015 UTC,"listen to his live sets.  a lot of really good ones are on his Soundcloud.   Live in Torbay (not on Soundcloud, but Youtube has it) Essential Mix Live @ Creamfields 2011 EPIC @ Brixton Academy New Years Eve 2013 @ Echostage EPIC 3.0 @ Madison Square Garden   Also listen to his EPIC Radio podcast.  tracklists for everything I just mentioned can be found on 1001 Tracklists.  once you understand the majesty that is Eric Prydz live/in the mix, exploration of the catalog will occur naturally.  Welcome to a beautiful and frustrating addiction."
ericprydz,32rch1,evilabed23,2,Thu Apr 16 16:29:21 2015 UTC,Torbay is the place to start (might be getting slightly old now though)

ericprydz,32rch1,7rust,2,Thu Apr 16 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"First things first. Grab your headphones. Open Spotify and start listening to everything Pryda one by one. I'd suggest you start with 'Human Behavior' and end with 'F. A. T' so you can feel how his style has changed throughout the years. After that check his ""Eric Prydz presents Pryda"" album as you'll find plenty of other progressive goodies. Then it will be time to get to know him as a dj. My highlight sets are the both EMs, and the one at Ultra last year.   If you're also interested in the darker side of things check him out as Cired D, his techno alias. These releases are up on Spotify too.   After you're done listening to everything he's released so far check his unreleased tracks that he has been dropping in clubs. You can find them everywhere on YT. I'll update you with a link later on.   EDIT: You can listen to some of the Eric Prydz/Pryda/Cirez D IDs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3M6XV2wcbf_8nyVaW5F3_b-84YdIlqHp  While here you can find the full discography and his aliases: http://www.discogs.com/artist/16619-Eric-Prydz   Enjoy your journey and welcome to the PRYDA family!"

ericprydz,32lihc,PiazzaDelivery,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Axwell, Ingrosso, and those falling in line with the view that underground electronic music is amateur are dead wrong.   In the article, instead of answering accusations regarding the dumbing down of the sound to appeal to the masses, Ingrosso attacks underground instead of defending his own position. That's akin to saying that electronic fans should listen to him because the alternative isn't better. Artists should strive to be as creative as they can be, rather than garnering fans because they are the lesser of two evils.   Additionally, the example that Beyer provides in his tweet as ""underground,"" apart from being a low-quality YouTube video, is utterly incompatible with the kind of sound that is described as such today, which he should know considering he's an integral part of the A&R for Drumcode. The availability of technology and the prevalence of electronic music knowledge and tutoring is vastly different than it was in 2004, when ""Deep Inside"" was released. This may depend on where you start out, but as far as Montreal is concerned (the market I'm familiar with), artists have a large group of peers with varying degrees of experience always at the ready to give feedback and assist in the development of a ""professional"" quality sound, something that, once again, was almost non-existent 11 years ago.   To further illustrate my point, here's an underground track from 2013 by Move D called ""To The Disco '77."" Simply put, comparing underground from 2004 to today's amount to nothing more than apples and oranges. To be frank, it reads to me as though Axwell and Ingrosso are rationalizing their tend towards mainstream."

ericprydz,32hfmz,gtevans19,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:58:00 2015 UTC,I wasn't too blown away by his Soundstage set. Not having all of his lights/productions really take away from the experience. Echostage is one of my favorite venues. I saw him NYE and he tore that place down for 3 hours.
ericprydz,32hfmz,DOWDKR01,4,Tue Apr 14 14:16:54 2015 UTC,I find this interesting because my favorite show was at the Guvernment had just a few lights and I preferred it over the Generate tour or any festival set I've seen him in. I don't really care about the production a ton.

ericprydz,32hfmz,gtevans19,1 point,Wed Apr 22 10:42:47 2015 UTC,"I was there too. I also wouldn't say I was blown away, but I thoroughly loved it and had an amazing night. Sweet Genesis, Shrine, Creamfields, Blue Monday w/ Harder Better, Turn Around, I could go on...The tracklist alone made the night for me. I liked having a chance to really listen to the music and dance instead of being glued to Eric's amazing visuals.  All of that said...I completely agree with you about Echostage. Like you, I was there for New Years, and also again when he came back in June - he played ""what the fuck I want"" for four hours straight. Combine that with his visuals and the production at Echostage, and you get my favorite live performance of his that I've seen (NYE, June, EPIC 3.0, Soundstage). I have a good feeling his set in May will be like that one last June...I'm already buzzing with excitement."
ericprydz,32hfmz,DOWDKR01,2,Tue Apr 14 19:45:13 2015 UTC,"My comment came off a little snarky.. I loved his Soundstage set, but the last time I saw him (also the first) was at Echo for NYE and that show blew my mind. His visuals were amazing that night!! I do love when its just about the music like at U Street Music Hall, but something about Soundstage just wasn't right for a Prydz show. Really stoked to get to see him at Echo now. That place is always crazy and surprisingly brings in a good Prydz crowd instead of kandi kids."
ericprydz,32hfmz,UndesirableNo127,2,Wed Apr 15 11:09:33 2015 UTC,I'll be there.
ericprydz,32hfmz,gtevans19,2,Mon Apr 13 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"Very excited to see him again so soon!  And an extended set too!  I've been bummed about missing his Miami shows and afraid I wouldn't have another chance to see him until the fall, pending an EPIC 4k announcement...  But this will do nicely!"
ericprydz,32hfmz,AreYouAfraidOfTheD,2,Tue Apr 14 18:19:23 2015 UTC,I'm with you there...I saw Eric in February and I was sooo pleasantly surprised when I heard he was coming back this soon. I guess we can thank EDC NY since he plays there on Sunday that weekend - a DC stop was a no-brainer.
ericprydz,32hfmz,twobeees,2,Tue Apr 14 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"Im flying out there from Los Angeles.  Heard great things about the Venue, so Im stoked to see what itll bring. Loved his 2013 NYE set, and with how Eric has been throwing down lately, Im sure I wont be disappointed."

ericprydz,32fhfc,Otsel7,30,Mon Apr 13 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"The first time I had even heard of Eric Prydz was when he opened with this song at EDC last year.  I had wanted to go on a trip to EDC for years, and when I finally had the time and money to go, I found it incredibly disappointing. It was the third and last night, and I had already grown bored of hearing the same shit over and over again. I couldn't tell if it was because I was getting too old, or if it was because every headliner there was actually shit.  It was by complete chance that I wound up at Circuit Grounds for Eric Prydz. Clockwork had just finished and I decided to stay to kill time before Above & Beyond went on (whom I was looking forward to the most all weekend).  The lights were off. It was dark. More people were leaving than coming, so I wasn't expecting much. The past couple of days sucked. It couldn't get any worse. But as the first few notes of Generate grew louder and louder, and the room slowly filled with pure, white light, I was hit by something so beautiful that I literally gasped because I forgot to breathe. There was no introduction. No name. No bullshit. Just good music. It was the best set I had ever heard in my entire life. I couldn't even enjoy myself with Above & Beyond because I was still stunned by what just happened.  All my friends were raving about how much fun they had listening to so and so that weekend. I couldn't say that. ""Fun"" doesn't bring justice to his set. The closest I can get to describing his set is as a religious experience. I damn near cried. I've never felt so many emotions run through me as sound waves before—not even when my fiancée first told me she loved me. Ten months later, and I still can't bring myself to listen to anything but Eric Prydz. My phone has nothing but his music—all of his EPIC Radios, all of his Essential Mixes, all of his singles, and as many of his sets as I could find.  I keep going back to that moment when the room was suddenly flooded with white light and this song started playing. You could offer me a Ferrari, or even a blowjob from Kate Beckinsale, but nothing in the world would ever make me want to give up that memory."
ericprydz,32fhfc,mugubushi,8,Mon Apr 13 15:29:40 2015 UTC,Eric just retweeted this!  Edit: He even apologized to Ferrari and Kate Beckinsale afterward haha!

ericprydz,32fhfc,Mr_Flappy,2,Mon Apr 13 21:13:38 2015 UTC,More people were leaving than coming   I LOVED this at EDC -  they all took off to see i think calvin harris or whatever at main stage SO IT WAS SO EMPTY (relatively) FOR PRYDZ! More room to dance
ericprydz,32fhfc,cmsimike,2,Mon Apr 13 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"I was there for this set and it was a haunting opening. We were all dead center of circuit grounds and Generate started building and my friends and I all instinctively stopped talking, looked to the lights, and were like ""oh shit, this is going to be big"". Cemented my belief of this man's talent. He is 90% of what I listen to since this day."

I think though that over years of working on tracks after tracks you just kind of learn what a song needs to sound complete even if most of your listeners don't hear it at all. You learn how to mix certain tracks so well that everything feels fit like a jenga tower but nothing feels to full.   He's been at this for over 10 years, and with his natural talent, his experience I believe makes him one of the best producers out there today"
ericprydz,31zibw,lurchh,4,Thu Apr 9 14:55:09 2015 UTC,"just from the standpoint of replay value as a listener, its unreal how much his music draws you in the more you listen.  nearly every artist - from outside the genre of dance to olander, maceo plex, sam pagnini and fehrplay - the best of them, as much as i love their stuff, no other music I listen to actually increases in replay value instead of slowly depreciating (fuck even strobe doesnt make the cut).  Bottom line, if Lycka, Mija, Reeperbahn or Bergen (and so so many more... ironman, 1983...) start playing, it wont be stopped until the track ends.  when eric released Mija, I literally said ""meh its ok"" on day 1.  i consider it his best release ever now.  that intrigues the hell out of me... i wonder if he knows or intends on that when producing.  maybe he test trials his stuff with how it stands time as well, who knows.

ericprydz,31zibw,zz_,0,Fri Apr 10 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"I actually do know.  You clearly don't understand my point.  Eric has already produced the music, the work is done, he just fails to release it allowing him to make money off it, which is what I fail to understand.  Its absurd to think that Eric releasing his entire catalog would significantly hinder the product of his live shows and tours to a point where demand to see him live would be less."
ericprydz,31zibw,msmills1322,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"In fact, releasing more music would likely only increase Eric's popularity and fan-base, thus increasing demand to see him live, etc."
ericprydz,31zibw,porksandwich9113,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why Eric hasn't released the album yet. If he released it tomorrow, it would hit #1 (which I expect from Generate), yet it would quickly fall out of the charts (I also expect this for Generate).   Album releases are all about the marketing plan, and everything I've seen Eric do so far in 2015 is part of the album plan. The Essential Mix to start off the year, then the ASOT Stage at UMF. The latter seemed odd to both Prydz fans and Trance fans, yet he destroyed it. His set was atop a lot of lists from that weekend.   Secondly as you have stated, most of the money comes off of touring. As we know Eric has been working on the 4K shows. Now, whenever an Artist releases an album, a world tour usually follows. We haven't really seen it in EDM yet, but Above and Beyond (We Are All We Need Tour) and the Armin Only Intense Tour, are the only large scope tours I can think of.   Eric and his team need to have the tour laid down before they even think of releasing the album. Simply to ride the momentum; people buy album, love album, see a show near them, buy ticket, attend show. Album and tour announcements are hand in hand.   There is a lot of work to go into a full album release on the scale that Eric is planning. I know the music is done, they are simply waiting on everything else."

ericprydz,31zibw,lolz_alot,-5,Mon Apr 13 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"the little amount he spends touring doesn't equate to little amount of releases he has, he has so much time in the studio compared to other artist. I'm not talking mainstream artist either. Tons of other artist spend the majority of their time touring and not in the studio. Prydz is one of my favorite producers but to me he just doesn't cut it as a DJ anymore. He is so production based as an artist but has so little output. I listen to dance music and love it for the live aspect of it so producers don't mean much to me. There are only a few i truly follow and prydz is one of them."
ericprydz,31zibw,cookiemonsta122,11,Thu Apr 9 17:45:23 2015 UTC,just doesn't cut it as a DJ anymore.   Wat.  His live mixing is absolutely insane compared to most artists.
ericprydz,31zibw,zz_,5,Thu Apr 9 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"its not is mixing skills really, having seen him 10 or more times now there isnt anything new or exciting to me in his sets now. Yea he always plays a few IDs but its always the same. There is a lot more to a dj set then just the mixing skills. Ill hear tons of new ids seeing people like Beyer, Maceo Plex, Dixon, Sasha, Digweed, Ame, Alan Fitzpatrick, Dubfire, the list goes on. One reason I do think I may be so uninterested is the crowd he now draws. Great djs span many genres prydz sticks to his niche, which is alright, it is just not very exciting anymore to me. Seeing someone like Beyer play for 10 hours where he constantly has 3 tracks in the mix was a game changer for me. I don't like going to see djs hoping to hear tracks i know played, i go hoping to be blown away hearing tracks i dont know exist. Also seeing Henry Saiz play his mixing in my opinion is better because he has the ability to make songs that dont fit together work. It isnt that difficult to mix your music day in and day out as much as it is to find a new track and play it out in your set the same night you found it."
ericprydz,31zibw,msmills1322,6,Thu Apr 9 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"This is one of the downfalls of only playing your own music, its going to captivate some people repeatedly but eventually push some away. I know many fans that got tired of the same flow at every set and have become distant over time, but therein lies the love for the music. Not every set I've attended is groundbreaking, but I've never not enjoyed myself. It has nothing to do with the fact that it's even Eric, or what/how he's mixing, its strictly the sound that hypnotizes/energizes/electrifies me."

ericprydz,31l8u3,Fold0rDie,22,Mon Apr 6 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"If u just got into Prydz you really wont need any other artists for a while. Just go to his soundcloud and listen to everything on that. Especially his three 2011 mixes, Creamfields, Brixton and Ally Pally, his 2013 Essential Mixes (both the live ""Cirez D"" one from Cream and the Mix of the Yr), his 2015 Essential Mix with Olander, his EPIC 3.0 set and every EPIC Radio episode. Once you've done that check out everything that has ever been released on Pryda recordings, then everything that has been released on mouseville. After that check out every remix he's done.   Once youve done those things you can either jump on YT and start listening to all his unreleased tracks or check out his 3rd label, Pryda Friends, and fall in love with Olander and Fehrplay (who is no longer a part of Pryda Friends, but is still a boss). Once youre in love with those two check out everything else theyve done, from tracks not on PRYF to guest mixes and live mixes (plus VIvrant Radio, Jeremy's ""on hiatus"" quarterly podcast).  Once you've devoured everything Prydz, Olander and Fehrplay then you can start branching out. By this stage producers and djs like Henry Saiz, Guy J, Andre Sobota, Richard Knott, Eelke Kleijin might tickle your fancy. You might want some bigroom techno (Drumcode radio (with guys like Asam Beyer, Alan Fitzpatrick and Sam Paganini) is a great place to start)."
ericprydz,31l8u3,evilabed23,3,Mon Apr 6 05:40:31 2015 UTC,Well put!

ericprydz,31l8u3,Im_Lost_HELP,3,Mon Apr 6 14:28:06 2015 UTC,"Well first off listen to his album. The 3 disc version. That has all of the essential Prydz you need. Pryda also has had 4 or 5 singles released post-album that are some of my favourite stuff he's done.   His Pryda Friends label houses Jeremy Olander and until very recently, Fehrplay. You should give both of those artists a chance because they also make fantastic music."
ericprydz,31l8u3,noodleface4,3,Mon Apr 6 03:57:40 2015 UTC,I just started listening to Grum these past few months and must say a good chunk of his music sound pretty similar. Listen to his 2014 BBC essential mix when you get a chance (I'd link it but I'm at work)
ericprydz,31l8u3,sepehrack,2,Mon Apr 6 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"His musical style is not very similar to that of Prydz, and I don't know how others in this sub feel about him, but if you're looking for someone who has just as much (even more) craft and talent, check out Aphex Twin.   He has much on pretty much all ends of the spectrum, so don't blow him off after hearing one style that you don't like.  Aphex Twin is in my option the best producer to have ever been in the game. He makes his own instruments and has his own style because he started making music for himself because he didn't like any other music at the time.   Start off by listening to: Xtal Avril 14th Alberto Balsalm Vordhosbn 4 And produk 29.  Come over and visit /r/aphextwin if you feel so compelled!  Edit: actually, prydz is the one who introduced me to Aphex, when he played 'on' on episode 2 of epic radio. You may enjoy that track."
ericprydz,31l8u3,vulkkid,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"Start with his aliases(Cirez D and Pryda), then you have artists that released on his label: Jeremy Olander(and his darker alias Dhillon), Fehrplay, Andre Sobota etc. Some of Erics older aliases also such as AxEr(his collab with Axwell), you can also listen to older Axwell(back when he was one of the best) also there's Dubfires Summer of Dub Remix of I Found U that fits nicely with Cirez D stuff. After that artists such as Not Mani, Roddy Reynaert(and his Ifonika label), Mark fucking Marzenit, maybe eekkoo. You could try searching for below 126 bpm trance on beatport even tho that's a lot of digging for like 1 track(try this search on labels such as Press and Play and Black Hole, I found some really good stuff this way). Go to 1001tracklist and search for Eric and see what he's playing. And at the end of the day go to /r/RealProgHouse and there's a list of labels in sidebar you could dig through to find stuff you like. PS there's no 1:1 to Eric soundwise, he's really unique, but he was my intro to some of the more underground stuff, so just try to find nice songs, not Eric where there isn't one. Hope I was helpfull :)"

ericprydz,31kjwt,SquintyEyeNod,2,Sun Apr 5 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me as though the original vocal sample was altered, either with some pitch shifting or adjusting the formant with something like Melodyne. Maybe a vocoder on there as well. After that, there's either a gate or he manually spliced the sample up. Then there's some delay.   That's all just my guess, but if I were to try to recreate it, that would be the way I'd go about it.  Edit: Could also be that the sample used there is a different vocal take from the session, or a different person completely."

And a lot of people think that it's the mastering guy that does it all for me, but when it comes to mixing music in the mastering process, you're really limited because the track is one file. The only thing you can do in the mastering process is raise or lower the volume of certain frequencies, so you're very limited in what you can do. I think the strength in my productions is kind of the separation, and how all of the sounds are mixed together, and that's something that I kind of put a lot of effort into, because I always wanted my music to sound you know, really really good in a club. If you have a really good idea for a track, but it doesn't come across well on a big system, it sort of gets a lost in a way. So I would say 50% of a track is the actual mix of it. You have to make sure that you can hear all of the different channels clearly. I always try to make my tracks sound like this big powerful pack of muscle sort of thing you know, and it's kind of hard to explain how I do it because I use my ears, and I know how I want it to sound. Over the years I sort of learned how to get it to sound like that. Nowadays I don't even need to master my tracks after I'm finished, because I do the mastering, but while I'm doing the mixdown sort of thing. I never actually EQ the track on the master; i do it in the actual track with the elements, because that is how you get a good result really. So no, to answer your question again, I do everything myself. The only mastering that is done on the tracks is for the actual tracks that are gonna' be cut on vinyl, because on vinyl, you cannot have the music sounding as it does digitally. If you want to cut out music on vinyl, you need to cut out certain frequencies. You need to have the bass sound in mono, because if you have it in stereo then the needle is going to jump around a bit. And they do cut out a lot of the high-end as well, everything over 15,000/16,000 Hz, something like that. It's kind of a science in itself to get the level of the vinyl as high as possible. But they don't do any physical mastering of the track. What they try to do is cut out frequencies and press it as loud as possible on vinyl. So that's how it works. All the tracks on beatport and stuff like that is my own mastering really."" 2007 interview.  I think you have misconceptions about what sound engineering is.  That was in 2007. Since 2009/2010 he probably sends in to a mastering session (I can ear a difference since that era), but it's specially for a louder sound in ""RMS"".  If you are curious, you can ear the difference by buying Europa on Pryda Records (2007) and ear it in the Pryda album (2012). The Mastering doesn't change the mix at all (his mix down are fabulous), it's essentially to be in the same value of the Market which is very loud (between 8 to 10 db RMS).  I have to precise that many people can't define what is a sound engineer, that's why there is some confusion."
ericprydz,31jhnl,Thenzzo,0,Mon Apr 6 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"Do you know why ? Because every single physical release needs a special mastering. It needs to responds to a standard that I will not detail here. And in that special case it was for Calvin Harris' single.  The Mastering of a CD has to put all tracks on the same values. For example, you cannot put a David Guetta Remix, and a Prydz remix without putting them in the same standard. (EQ, DbRMS etc...) Imagine buying a CD, and it goes from Track 1 to Track 2, there is a huge difference of Volume, or even difference of High frequencies...  That job has to be done by someone who is external. And specially for that single, because he has to gather Tracks that have MixDown done by different persons.  When Prydz says the Mastering guy has done a bad work on purpose, it's obviously to highlight Calvin Harris, and David Guetta remix. Did I need to explain why...  PS: If you want to ear the Flashback (Eric Prydz remix) without the bad Mastering for The Calvin Harris single release, you can listen it in the EPIC RADIO 005. It's the dub version.  By the way it was an original track before to be the Flashback remix, that he used to play. And again without an external Mastering."
ericprydz,31jhnl,Thenzzo,0,Tue Apr 7 08:20:48 2015 UTC,"Nilesh Patel mastered the Vinyls, and Mike Marsh the CD Release : Pjanoo, and Pryda Album... Come on ! Are you sure, you are the one who knows by fact what is Prydz' role in his music. If not you can always ask him, but i'm pretty sure what he's going to say about."
ericprydz,31jhnl,Thenzzo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"Previously (and we're talking many years ago) he said that anything digital he would do the mastering himself, but stuff for vinyl would get a special vinyl only master because the format has it's own attributes that you need to master for, like bass being in mono and certain frequencies being reduced. I don't know if that's still the case though, or if he gets digital only stuff mastered elsewhere."

ericprydz,31ee48,urbantales,2,Mon Apr 6 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what happened, but the Michael Cassette project is still ongoing. They released a single, a couple of months ago called ""Disco Frisco"". Too bad there's nothing going on on the Komytea project. But at least one of the members is actually active and is releasing under Erkka on Anjunadeep. He released ""Excommunication/Air Conditioner"" last year. And according to my sources there's another EP scheduled for release this spring."

They may have been re-recorded I think, but it was the same vocalist and no changes were made.  There wasn't enough of a difference for Eric to claim fair use, I guess, and thus why he can't sell it.  The 2014 remix is very very different though, so, maybe there is hope."
