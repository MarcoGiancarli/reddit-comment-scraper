No benevolent being would put this shit in my path, and allow me to view its entirety unpunished.    What makes this go beyond weird, is the fact that there is likely HUNDREDS of videos like this one hidden in the sewer of Youtube, a community of meaningless existence not unlike the life of an autistic child.  Sure, the kid exists, but he/she will never be more then the sum of his/her parts.  They are born from soiled components, corrupted DNA that somehow forced itself to be when by all rights they shouldn't have.  This video was forced to exist when nature would otherwise have aborted it.  It has been wronged by it's creator, who has violated all that is natural by becoming the non-existent god.  The author has disrupted the natural order without consequence, as our species does with the Earth time and again.  The rabbit hole exists for a reason: to save those who would unwittingly stumble into pitfalls of madness by showing them a gaping maw and its shadowed throat, hoping to keep the innocent from the belly of the beast and the hands of the proverbial devil."

It was created in 2010 for a campaign called to draw tourists to the region after the Kyushu Shinkansen line opened.  Kumamon subsequently became nationally popular, and in late 2011, was voted top in a nationwide survey of mascots, collectively known as yuru-chara, garnering over 280,000 votes.   Following his success in the contest, Kumamoto earned ¥11.8 billion (US$120 million, £79 million, €93 million) in merchandising revenue for the first half of 2012, after having only earned ¥2.5 billion (US$26 million, £17 million, €20 million) throughout all of 2011.

Weird,3c76kj,DaddyBishop,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:38:54 2015 UTC,Any tanning increases your chance of getting cancer. It's still radiation being blasted through you. Sunburn just means you got more radiation than a tan.

Millions of people do it especially during the summer. But I suppose spray tanning would be best for this as (I assume) it wears off, even quicker with light coatings, so if you don't like a particular design you can try another one later.  This would probably make a really good gimmick for spray tan salons. People could also try out a kind of ""temporary tattoo"" this  way as well before getting a permanent one done and not liking the outcome."

You have to create your own (or pay an attorney) to draw up a form if the state doesn't offer it.

The Artist Lives/Lived (I'm not sure if she killed herself or not) in a Nordic Country. She would get strays from the Neighbourhood and, freeze them to death to make objects like the one you see above. Anonymous, before it got big got wind ov this story and decided to fuck her life up. Her bank accounts were drained, she suddenly was a sex offender and, a couple showed up at her house claiming to own it because, somehow Anonymous sold her house. Then the protest started etc.   That's what I remember happening but, it was a long time ago so I might be off by a few details (maybe big maybe small). I don't remember the woman's name and searched google for about an hour before writing this.   Edit: I was wrong about most ov it. What the fuck was I smoking?"

She tries to be controversial and make people aware of the way we treat animals that aren't cute pets.  I kinda understand the point no matter if I think it's tasteful or whatever. It serves it's purpose and it makes people think.  But her demeanor, bleh... She is not only controversial when it comes to her art, she's controversial in normal conversations too. As if she wants to be amazing and say funky cool stuff anytime she opens her mouth. Saw a celebrity quiz with her a couple of weeks ago. Nothing she said made sense and it made the other participants and presentor embarassed too.

And to flaunt her morbid hobby while she is at it.   When you snap your own pets neck... Then describe the event with laughter and a smile... It's fairly clear. She enjoyed it. Her inability to form coherent, mature thoughts during public appearances suggests further mental illness. This isn't eccentricity, it's insanity."

Weird,35z6s2,CaptainPugwash75,2,Thu May 14 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"It's a compression algorithm error. The way compression works is if there are similar colored pixels next to each other, instead of for every frame it's listing every single pixel, it says ""this group of pixels are the same from this frame to this further-in-the-future frame"" This makes the file small enough to stream over the internet.  This also introduces problems over time, problems like the dark spots growing on his forehead (and elsewhere in the frame). They solve this problem by resetting the compression with something called a ""keyframe"" after a certain number of frames. It's a single frame that lists every single pixel, and it references that keyframe until the next keyframe shows up. That's why it suddenly resets and the dark spots go away.   I used to be a video editor, so that's my sideline-level knowledge. There might be a video compression programmer that could give better information."

I love it more because I don't understand the origin of all the symbolism; I am free to interpret it as I care to and enjoy the surreal artistry of it. It's honestly one of the best independent 3D vignettes I've ever seen, and is in my 'drink wine and watch YouTube' rotation.   It's beautiful, well-made and hearkens to a kind of deep subconscious aesthetic that gets your mind working in the background without really being obvious about what it's saying. The last scene, with Organized Religion and The Church crumbling as Christ recedes toward a new dawn, I fucking love that.   If there's anything that I don't completely love it's probably the Christian centrism of the film (equating Shiva and pagan nature gods for instance) and that odd part with the witch in the dick-tower, which strikes me as typical Fundamentalist misogyny. I only recently noticed the menstrual stain that appears between the witch's legs for a moment, and I subtly resent that in the same way that I like most of the rest of the film.  Fucking great stuff. Even if you're not into the Illuminati symbolism that probably underpins this, it's a fantastic watch.      If you type into google earth this below with quotes it's surprisingly weird where you end up.  ""ipetgoat""   Oh, that is cool. How did you even think to try this? CERN and the Dome of the Rock, I can see an abstract connection there - alpha and omega maybe, science and religion, the powers of man - but why a Paris hotel? How strange, and how awesome."

Weird,33azso,footm0uth,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"More on the sex offender thing. He once told me that he invited a 35 year old man over his house so he could hypnotize him (he couldn't get creepier enough right?). Well turns out the hypnosis didn't work and the guy was faking it. However my former friend thinking he was in a hypnotic state, leaned over and tried to smell the inside of the guys mouth. The guy pushed him away and nearly punched him and nearly called the cops. The guy thought he was trying to kiss him. He left the house and told some other people whom they were both mutual friends with about this incident. This lead these people to all distance themselves from him.  He then explained to me that he was only trying to ""smell the inside of his mouth"", like that's seriously much better. What a relief (not)! He hates the 35 year old now because he thinks he's immature. Yet he doesn't seem to understand what he did was wrong. He didn't fucking tell the guy what he was going to do to him while he was under hypnosis, the fact that he wasn't under hypnosis is irrelevant. My former friend thought he was and tried to take advantage of him and was caught in the act. Who's to say what else he would do?"

Weird,338xhi,lunebee,5,Mon Apr 20 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"As can be seen from the two large cut-off branches near the top, the crown has been reduced in the past, and there is quite a bit of epicormic growth visible - the small twigs and branches - straight from the trunk - so both of those suggest that it's not too healthy.  Now the size of the fence doesn't look large enough to contain the entire tree if it were to go over in a high wind, but is certainly large enough to stop people being underneath if it should randomly drop a branch, so I'd guess that that is why it's there.  They probably don't want to take the entire mature tree down unless they really have to - and it may be a bat roost, or be protected by a Tree Protection Order (TPO) or have some other significance - so they just want to make it safe to keep standing for as long as possible.  There would almost certainly be some pressure from the health & safety side to take it down, when it is in such a heavily used site, so I admire the rangers or gardeners or whoever for taking this approach instead."

Weird,2ytrl4,IamSeth,2,Thu Mar 12 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"This is a huge stretch, but it came to mind when I saw your post...  Is it possible you may have copied and pasted the text somehow?  If you have an app such as Clipper that saves a history of your clipboard, you could check and see if it is there. What I am thinking is maybe you inadvertently copied the text, and then started a reply and somehow scrolled down all at once (or glanced away as it happened or something) ... However it doesn't seem like you started a reply--but perhaps that is the glitch, that gmail let you type in a received email for some reason, and it just happened to coincide with the weird copy and paste behavior.  I suggest this because occasionally on my phone I'll get a really long delay or backing up of my touchscreen inputs, like it runs out of RAM all at once... and it will clear through the ""backlog"" of touches rapidly once/as it gets back up to speed, so I get all these actions performed that I didn't want it to do...   Usually no problem because it either doesn't register or just puts me to the home screen or something, but sometimes it will say, open an app, and then the remaining backed-up touches are all within that app and could cause things to happen.    Yeah so definitely a stretch, but that's so weird... I feel like there has to be an explanation, maybe a very unlikely coincidence."

Weird,2xwpdq,aesthe,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a biologist, but I'll speak to what I can.  As viruses essentially 'inject' themselves into a host's genetic code, it's fathomable that a single virus could impact many different species with the same gene sequence.  However in practice I don't think it's very common because the means of transmission and infection may make it impossible or unlikely between creatures with various environments and limited interaction.  When we talk about ""avian flu"" or ""swine flu"", for example, we are referring to strains of influenza that have traditionally been adapted to infecting those particular species, but has either mutated or found a new vector of transmission that's allowed it to cross over into humans.    I've found a CDC article that gives some info with much greater accuracy and authority than I can claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546865/"

Water seems to absorb the vibrations from the metal from the pot and output it from the top, causing the pitch to bend because of the geometry of the water surface + pot walls.  Any disturbance at all (even filling it with jelly beans), should cause the tapping sound to change pitch if tilted.  I thought it was weird, because I would expect it to just create a muffled tone, but it bounces everywhere. I guess it's not that weird to some people... maybe they spend time banging on pots with 5% water filled :P"

Weird,2w7yis,greenHillzone2,3,Wed Feb 18 07:49:04 2015 UTC,"Synesthesia:       Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, ""together"", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, ""sensation"") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.     People who report such experiences are known as synesthetes.  Difficulties have been recognized in adequately defining synesthesia:   many different phenomena have been included in the term synesthesia (""union of the senses""), and in many cases the terminology seems to be inaccurate. A more accurate term may be ideasthesia.  In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme → color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored.   In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week elicit precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be ""farther away"" than 1990), or may appear as a three-dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise).
