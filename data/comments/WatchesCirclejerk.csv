(People discussing the non-seiko 5s they own, where they got them, why they like them without natos etc). IMO those are the posts that need removing.   An [identify] post that turns out not to be a seiko 5 is not something I'd want removed. They are often educational and help readers ascertain why a non-seiko 5 is obviously (or subtly) not a grail. That is useful information, it doesn't glamorise un-fives and doesn't condone them either.   We got a lot of useless comments there, but I also like to think we've educated lots of people too. Many people now know how to spot certain non-fives, and have learnt why everything except seiko 5s are bad. Personally I think that's a good thing overall.   Edit: I'm not a mod lol"

If it's still ticking at around +/- 5 seconds/day or better, then you know it's the right one. But that's not it, also assess the fit while it's inside your ass - is it snug? Is it too big, or too small? If it's too small, it probably means you're either a prostitute specializing in anal sex or you need to move up into 44mm+ watches, which makes you worse than a prostitute specializing in anal sex.

Congrats to them!  The Apple Watch, however, looks like utter DOGSHIT for so many reasons;  -The screen, inevitably, is blank.   -Regardless of your opinion of the AW, it looks totally out of place with that outfit and in that context. Like a G-Shock in same scenario, completely inelegant. If it was a themed wedding it might make sense, but their dress would suggest a traditional ceremony.   -Is that a white rubber band?! Not to my tastes, but a Milanese loop could look slightly more passable at a stretch, the screen illuminated with one of the simpler faces.   -At the outside, it'll be confined to a drawer within 2 years - hardly a talking point for children and descendants beyond a throwaway ""You wore THAT on your wedding day?LOL"".  -Taste is subjective, granted, but outside of the most ardent Apple fanatics I find it hard to conceive that the Apple Watch in any of its current incarnations could ever be considered ""beautiful"". Functional and competent perhaps but wholly unremarkable. Don't see this changing in future iterations either, like phones they'll become ever sleeker, thinner, the hardware ""disappearing"" and becoming merely a portal into it's functionality.

WatchesCirclejerk,3b98l2,pcopley,3,Sat Jun 27 18:22:56 2015 UTC,I thought we said no posts about the Apple Watch...

WatchesCirclejerk,3b98l2,itsmine91,2,Sat Jun 27 05:45:40 2015 UTC,Calc needs a NATO
WatchesCirclejerk,3b98l2,BoydCrowder,2,Sat Jun 27 13:41:33 2015 UTC,Far for me to criticize as I may never be able to afford either of these beauties but I can't help but wonder why he couldn't spring for the ultimate digital watch which would have been the combo calculator and remote control?
WatchesCirclejerk,3b98l2,JUNGLE_HABITAT,2,Sat Jun 27 16:13:05 2015 UTC,Loving casio's in-house movements with those complications WOW
WatchesCirclejerk,3b4wjl,Alenczy,2,Fri Jun 26 00:14:08 2015 UTC,How big are your wrists?
WatchesCirclejerk,3b4wjl,frshmt,2,Fri Jun 26 09:35:48 2015 UTC,What kind of NATO do you pair it with?

WatchesCirclejerk,3b4wjl,abstractia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"Bit too opulent for my tastes, OP. If I strapped that on I'd look like a shriveled up old skeleton in no time.  I prefer this more rugged, approachable look: http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/indianajones/images/f/f1/Holy_Grail.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110317234056"
WatchesCirclejerk,3aytsh,OutOfBounds11,8,Wed Jun 24 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"I'm really sick and tired of companies stealing Rodina's Bauhaus design. I mean seiko managed to do it just fine with the seiko 5.   That being said, this design is perfection. Definitely a grail for me."
WatchesCirclejerk,3aytsh,GadnukBreakrOfWorlds,6,Wed Jun 24 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"This early Seiko alpanist homage is neat, but why get this on a NATO when you kould save for a handful of years to get the respectable grail of grail5?"
WatchesCirclejerk,3aytsh,Cylindt,2,Thu Jun 25 15:23:52 2015 UTC,Wait are those holes out of focus in the back? ARE YOU SAYING IT'S PERFECT TO PUNCH HOLES IN A GENTLE NATO STRAP WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING??? I disagree sir. #natodefenseforce #dontkillnatos #natosarepeopletoo

WatchesCirclejerk,3aytsh,itsmine91,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Mach 2000 = 687 km/s at sea level. I highly doubt this watch (or anything else) could withstand that inside Earth's atmosphere.
