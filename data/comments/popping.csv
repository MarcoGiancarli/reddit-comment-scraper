Secondary to that, there's no spider captured that indicates that it was the culprit. This is most likely a staphylococcus infection, given the cellulitis and the mass of pus. Pus is a result of infection, not envenomation by loxosceles. This is just zebra chasing and placing blame on spiders for nor real reason with no evidence."

Here is the link.  The video itself is behind a content warning wall, but the relevant portion is in the description and comments. The poster says this happened in western Pennsylvania, he was told by two doctors that it was the result of a spider bite, and did not contract a staph infection like MRSA.  Of course, he may be wrong. But I thought it prudent to mention that this was the information presented."

The Brown Recluse was a spot on match. Now is it from here more then likely not, if was probably brought from something, but just wanted to say that story.

popping,3e1bsw,ngggnnnn,3,Tue Jul 21 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"Went to the dermatologist and had it done.   Dr. Looked at it and said it didn't look like a dangerous kind, so normally removal of this nature would be cosmetic; thusly not covered in USA insurance.  But! Mine was right between my left eyebrow and hairline so I would brush it occasionally or scratch it I my sleep and wake up with dried blood on my face.  Now that's a medical reason!  So...  She numbed the area with lidocaine injections (little pinch.) Waited 45 seconds or so and scalpeled it off!!! Didn't feel a thing except for a slight sawing motion. Then she used a machine to cauterize it and here we are! After she left the room I unscrewed the lid the mole was in and took a pic!  My dermatologist sends all moles off to be tested for all the things.   Keep it covered for 2 weeks and only use petroleum jelly on it is what she said but it made it all weird and mushy so I stopped doing that after day four. Day 5 now and its looking pretty good.  There will be a scar but I don't care!   Aside from the numbing shot as long as your tools were clean and you don't mind pain theoretically you could do it at home!"

He was the person Accutane was invented for (not literally).  You have to dig them out and the skin is like big stretchy craters. It's terrible and not worth doing. Better to just leave alone.   That's not even the grossest thing I popped. The grossest was a cyst he had that got bitten by a spider. I seriously thought we both were gonna die - him from the pain and infection and me from the smell. He had this cyst for years and when he got the spider bite it was bright purple and oozing...dammit I have to make dinner soon.  Anyway, there are different forms of it, but these do fill with crap and you can push it out, but the holes don't close. After taking Accutane his skin there (on his back/shoulder) got really red and flaky and a few years later healed for the most part. That's also why I don't know why they say there was no treatment. It worked for him, but the scarring on his back is just brutal in general from the cysts and scar tissue underneath."

He was not prepared to see her internal organs just lying to the side of her caesarian section cut while the uterus was being manipulated forward to get the baby out. For some reason, he thought the uterus was in FRONT of the woman's internal organs, not behind it. So he said ""ah... yeah... it's all good"" to his missus while trying not to barf.

My asshole father has been cultivating a monstrosity on his back for decades. My mom, a former nurse and fellow popping video fan, has offered to drain and film it or to film it at the doc's office. Once he finally decided to do something about it, he went to the doctor without telling anyone and not filming it. And this is after he said that he would let my mom film it.   We were so disappointed. Although my mom did get to handle the wound cleaning in the days after the procedure.   Don't be like my dad. That's all.   And definitely get a professional to deal with it.

He or she may refer you to a podiatrist as this case looks quite advanced. Cantharone/cantharidin is a common treatment for plantar warts; it's very effective and might be helpful to your situation - your doctor should be able to tell you more including the risks. It works as a blistering agent causing the skin to blister underneath the wart itself. After applying the solution, and waiting for a couple of days, the doctor will debride the affected area. It may take a couple of treatments, but it is well worth it, especially if other treatment options have not succeeded. New shoes are highly recommended."
popping,3dsbl7,cassitea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:47 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. They're a PITA.  I've had successful experiences with getting a doc to freeze them. I've also had unsuccessful experiences.  Good experiences: a doc who knows what they're doing, and who freezes it for long enough / hard enough / a large enough area. It should come up in a big blister the next day - they're killing the external layers of skin with the warts in, which causes the skin to shed and take the wart with it. It hurts a little, but it's not agony: you won't need to bite down on a stick while they do it.  Bad experiences: a doc who doesn't freeze them enough, and so you don't kill the skin with the base of the wart in it, and it basically has no effect. If you have to have more than 1 treatment for each wart, they aren't freezing it right. (For a multiple-wart area like you have, more than 1 ""good"" treatment by may be necessary to get the whole area. The ""bad"" treatments are when you have a tiny wart and they freeze it again and again ...)  Other things tried unsuccessfully: salicylic acid home treatment. Takes ages, you just shed layers of warty skin and end up infecting yourself in different places and/or infecting your housemates too.  HTH, and good luck."
popping,3dsbl7,LaPoderosa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"I had 4 warts, or rather two big solo ones and two clusters, on both my feet. I tried frickin everything. Duct tape, freezing both at home and at the doctors, special wart ""medication"" that you spread over the wart. NOTHING worked. At last, I just made peace with it.   Then one day I was grocery shopping and needed some hand lotion and the foot lotions caught my eyes. (I've always been struggling with dry and hard feet since I walk ALOT). I bought one with aloe vera in it, but mostly because it smelled like candy. Started using it everytime after I showered and out of nowhere the warts were all gone. I didn't even notice. So, foot lotion with aloe vera worked for me. :)"

ACV, duct tape, freezing, Salicylic acid, digging, everything. What finally got rid of them was a tree extract called thuja. You can get pills but that's just homeopathy. Get the tincture which is the pure plant oil. It burns a bit when you put it on so avoid healthy skin. Applied that 3 times daily along with filing them down and the bitches went in 2 weeks."

One of these should do it for you. In my opinion the ACV or duct tape method is much too bothersome. I'm also the type who doesn't trust doctors, so there's a little salt for you.

popping,3dg0pp,approx_volume,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:16:40 2015 UTC,301+ views means that there are people watching/have watched the video that the total hasn't accounted for. Not everybody's interested in fake internet points.

I get it way worse than that every winter on my hands and it hurts to even flex my hands at all sometimes. There was once I literally could not grip and turn a door knob because of the pain. OP, vet some Aquaphor. It seriously helped mine heal up to a very tolerable level. Let it set overnight with some gloves or a bandage if the area is small enough and wash it off in the morning. Repeat every night. I know how much it sucks. Also avoid harsh soaps. I don't know if yours is the kind of Eczema that does well or poorly with antibacterial but keep washing and moisture on the hands to a minimum. Hope you feel better! :)"

popping,3diso1,mrssailorwife,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:46 2015 UTC,Thank you. :) Aquaphor saves me. It at least takes the pain and redness out of the equation. I still have the dryness and have to be careful about washing my hands too much but the Aquaphor makes it bearable. If I get lazy my hands often crack open and bleed. In the summer I am fine because of the humidity where I live. Winter is brutal though and I can tell how cold it is by my skin.

About a month, month and a half after my wisdom teeth were removed, a very jagged, sharp edge started rising from my gums where my lower-left wisdom tooth had been. It began abrading against my tongue to the point that it was excruciating just to swallow.  I went to dental sick call to have them look at it and pull out whatever it was - I just assumed it was a chunk of wisdom tooth that had gotten missed.   I was sitting in the chair and explaining to the dentist how this was a huge issue and I couldn't function with it still there - I had an open sore on my tongue from it at this point - and she looked at it, then told me that she wouldn't/couldn't do anything with it because it was so close to some big nerve that runs along your jaw, and I could have severe adverse side effects if she nicked it or damaged it.  I reiterated to her that I simply could not function with this sharp bit in my mouth, and she reiterated that she wouldn't do anything.  I said, ""Ok, I'll just do it myself, then."" I pulled my Gerber multitool off my belt and flicked it open and started moving it towards my mouth, and she grabbed my arm and yelled at me to stop.  She seemed very angry and said she'd be right back. A few minutes later she reappeared with some sort of consent form or liability waiver for me to sign, then reached in my mouth and tink just broke off the sharp part of whatever it was, and pulled out a chunk of something that was about as thick and wide as a fingernail clipping, and about 2.5-3mm long.  Had another one appear in a different wisdom tooth spot a few years later, I just pried it out with a pair of needle-nose pliers and a nail file."

popping,3dknpq,coldirtybastard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"Based on its pearly/blister-like appearance...with the dent/spot in center...it could be molluscum contagiosum. They are a very contagious wart-like poxvirus. If this is what it is, more might pop up around it in a cluster. Most doctors/dermatologists will either treat it the same way they would a wart or tell you to let your immune system attack it naturally...which can take several months and could spread all over the body before it does.   The easiest/cheapest way to take care of it on your own, is to soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and secure it over the pox/wart with a waterproof bandage overnight. In the morning, it should swell up and start to turn black. Turning black is good, cause that means it is killing the virus inside if it. The virus is stored in these tiny sesame seed-like pods that are buried inside each wart/pox. The best way to make sure to get rid of the pox and prevent it from spreading is to break open the wart/pox...after it has soaked in the apple cider vinegar overnight...and CAREFULLY remove every single seed pod. There are usually around 3 seeds in the larger pox/warts. It is easiest to do this with a sewing needle that has been sanitized with a flame and rubbing alcohol...using the eye of the needle to scoop them out. You can also try using tweezers or a q-tip that has been broken in half...and use the stick ends to pinch out the seed/pods. Remember, these seed/pods contain the virus...which is VERY contagious...so remove them carefully, immediately dispose into trash that won't be handled again and sanitize all utensils, work area, the pox/wart and skin surrounding it, and hands with rubbing alcohol...before and after removing seed/pods. Once all have been removed, sanitize area, put a dab of antibiotic ointment on it, and cover with bandage until it heals.   Killing one, might bring others that were dormant under the skin around it to the surface. New ones will look more like a little pimple and might only have one seed/pod to kill...and might only need to be soaked in the apple cider vinegar to get the job done.   Of course, you should probably get professionally diagnosed first. But, if you at apply the apple cider vinegar to it overnight...and it starts to turn black in the center...that is a good sign that it is at least a wart...if not molluscum contagiosum. Good luck!"

popping,3dcn8w,Lenaballerina,7,Wed Jul 15 12:58:17 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking. I had my ingrown toe nail clipped by a doctor and he told me that for up to 6 months after I needed to tape the skin from one side stretching the skin under my toe to the other side and then place bits of cotton under the nail in order to train the nail to grow properly.  Talk about painful. Had to wear shoes with large toe boxes and since the nail had been cut down the side I had to bandage the toe in order to keep blood from staining my shoe or socks.

popping,3dgn9o,mrssailorwife,3,Thu Jul 16 06:55:20 2015 UTC,I know! That's the first thing I thought! Our dogs have swallowed human hair before and it sometimes would hang from their butts after going potty. Out vet told us is a pretty common thing to happen with dogs that spend the majority of their time inside. They told us to pull slowly so the hair doesn't break and that it doesn't tie their intestines up.   Not to mention with a tape worms they will break off when under stress - like when in the process of removal - and it only takes one tiny segment to grow into a worm that is 5 food long.   Edit - a word that my phone autocorrected
popping,3dgn9o,Yssupehtnithgirrekuf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"when I followed the liveleak to the embedded youtube video, these two vids came up. First is only interesting for the thumbnail, presumably meant to be an opened tapeworm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnLumXP14c4  The second is the flea to tapeworm lifecycle which we all know. but I didn't know that each segment has eggs in it omfg. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzdhZQiRmic"
popping,3dgn9o,pandroidgaxie,2,Thu Jul 16 22:29:29 2015 UTC,Oh yes. The tape worm is truly one of the more disgusting parasites you can have. They reproduce in ungodly numbers and they can grow back from just one tiny segment.
popping,3dgn9o,Yssupehtnithgirrekuf,2,Fri Jul 17 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"they ... I don't think they usually come out like that. do they?   when cats have the little tiny squirmy ones come out, the vet says the ones we see are just segments that were shed. the real worm dies with the medication and gets reabsorbed into the body.  We were told never to even yank on easter grass or christmas tree ""icicles"" poking out if their butts in case it was tightly entangling something in there.   There's always videos claiming to be removing something that is actually medical packing. But I can't think what else this could really be - it doesn't resemble anything else!"
popping,3dgn9o,pandroidgaxie,2,Thu Jul 16 14:06:30 2015 UTC,Tape worms can be pulled out like that but they should never be pulled out as quickly as they do in this video. Not only will it bunch the intestines up but it could tie them off and tape worms generally feed off of the intestines and ripping them out could cause more trouble than you're bargaining for.   It's generally best to have them removed by a vet or have your dog treated to kill the worm and then have the vet remove it or let your dog pass it on their own.

Wait and the part with blood will shrivel - wait until it heals the blood vessel 2-4 days. Often they get dry and brittle and the top will break off. Clean and add a very tiny dab of antiseptic to the cut off base and place a band-aid disc over it. It should heal soon. If you break it off too early = a bleed might occur. If so, use pressure on it for 10 minutes and put another disc on it."

Do this a couple times and it should go away. Dunno how I'd feel about having that pop in your eye.  I get this every once in a blue moon. Apparently if you get it once, you're more likely to get it again, as I was told by my optometrist. Pretty sure I got mine from bad/old make up.

Regarding staph infection, it is notorious for hanging out in our noses for a long time then suddenly ending up in something on your face, like a stye, so if they gave you any kind of cream or lotion or whatever, if you are able to, put some up in your nostrils. I did that and it's been a couple years since I've had any issues after having 3-4 different staph infections. Best of luck."

So they went into the ER.  The hospital felt they were unable to assess it so sent them by ambulance to Children's hospital. Turns out it was a abscess from a regular germ that everyone has in her sinus that created pus and broke through the sinus wall and emerged through her eye. It also went right up near her brain but luckily they caught it before it touched. The doctors said it was so close, they're lucky.  They only see this maybe twice a year. She's had 3 surgeries to clear it all out from her sinuses and in her head."

popping,3cy3gy,danw650,2,Sun Jul 12 01:27:43 2015 UTC,I have so many tonsil stones right now. I wish I could do this without puking :(
popping,3cy3gy,ph0bos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:47:39 2015 UTC,Why do you have them? When causes them and why don't you get them removed?
popping,3cy3gy,danw650,7,Sun Jul 12 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"tl;dr tonsillectomy for adults is not a minor thing  so-called tonsil stones like the videos arise on people who have scarred and pitted tonsils from infections, or just people who have surface folds. No matter how careful they are about hygiene, teeny tiny little bits of food get in there, and the body forms this goo around it, like a pearl. Normally the body ejects these on its own, but some people are not so lucky.  Tonsillectomy is the only permanent cure, but it's a serious surgery for adults because of the generous blood supply.  (for a kid they are so small that it takes like 2 minutes, do it. for adults it can be a 30+ minute surgery with painstaking cauterization to control bleeding. In the olden pre-laser days it could take 2 hours.)  In modern times we avoid unnecessary surgery, partly because general anesthesia carries a risk (however slight.) The criteria for having tonsils out is multiple infections a year for multiple years. If untreated, a strep infection can permanently damage your heart and other organs, which make them vulnerable to fatal conditions. So if your tonsils are trying to kill you through repeated infections, doctors are obliged to take them out.  Tonsil stones won't kill you, despite making people miserable with bad breath. If you have insurance, you can always find a doc who'll willingly take your tonsils out anyway. But for adults you will miss at least a week of work, usually more, drinking codeine every four hours for the substantial pain. Women say natural childbirth was much less painful."

The 5AM pin pricks sucked, but the worst is that I cannot sleep on my back. I just can't. Sadly when your sack is the size of a cantaloupe (even drained, ew I know) you can't really roll over. Thankfully on the second night I was able to partially roll onto my side and get a little bit of sleep.

I go to immediate care. A dipshit hippy Doc says ""Oh its just a big zit, gives me antibiotics and sends me on my way. That night I wake up shivering, sweating, fever, crying etc. The spot now takes up most of my stomach. Nothing comes out if I press. I wait until morning and go to immediate care.

popping,3cyczy,fyrephoenix,3,Sun Jul 12 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"Well, quoting from Wikipedia (yes, I know, a bad source if ever I saw one)   Cellulitis is caused by a type of bacteria entering the skin, usually by way of a cut, abrasion, or break in the skin. This break does not need to be visible. Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are the most common of these bacteria, which are part of the normal flora of the skin, but normally cause no actual infection while on the skin's outer surface."

Would you indulge my curiosity & tell me what it was like for you? How was recovery (like pain level, what did you feel like or not feel like doing? How long did it take for you to recover?)?

The a muscles heal & it further anchors the port, that one hurt like a bitch, I never realized until then how much we use our core muscles.

I didn't realize I had tonsil stones until this sub about a month ago. In response to the smell, that hasn't been a problem for me, probably because I don't get too many tonsil stones and the ones that I do get tend to be small and pop out on their own."

popping,3cqvvm,Annoyedleo,5,Fri Jul 10 08:59:57 2015 UTC,"Here's a first aid tip, if you want to save yourself the time (not to mention the cost) of a trip to the hospital.  When you have a situation where blood/pus is building up under a finger or toe nail, you can trepan the nail yourself with a paperclip heated up on a stove or with a lighter. Just heat up the end of the paperclip until it's red hot, and then press it against the nail above the contained blood while twisting it back and forth in a drilling motion. It can sometimes take one or two applications, but it should go through the nail really easily and painlessly, making a small hole through which you can drain out all the icky stuff. Then all you need to do is put on some antibiotic ointment and a band-aid for the next few days, to prevent infection, and you're good to go!  It's also a lot of fun."

popping,3cvbdf,frumpyballerina,2,Sat Jul 11 07:26:04 2015 UTC,"So those are your pores & that's how hey look up close magnified a bit. Howeve, you aren't using a magnifier here so that tells me that your pores are just a bit too wide/open. I read the comments & you said there is stuff in them but no matter how hard you squeeze nothing comes out? Well, that's because it's not bad stuff in there, it's the natural oils our body produces to keep our skin hydrated. If you want to resolve this problem first, stop squeezing your poor face. Make sure you have a good skin care routine. Wash your face, use a moisturizer appropriate for your skin type (for example: for oily skin, for dry skin, or combination of oily & dry). Even if you think you have oily skin, you need to moisturize. Eventually once your body gets use to the fact that every night you're going to wash your face, & give it the moisture it needs then the amount of oily your skin produces on its own should dramatically decrease. (I say ""should"" because that's what happens unless there is a larger dermatological issue going in that would prevent your skin from responding normally.) Finally though, the best thing for reducing pore size is via Microderm abrasion. You can get this done at spas, at some dermatology offices, occasionally a plastic surgeons office, but it can be petty pricy. I have a Mary Kay Microderm abrasion set at home. I think it was like $50 but you don't have to use much of it to see results & you don't do it every day because that's too rough on your skin. I've seen a dramatic improvement in my skin thanks to that set. I would think since Mary Kay sells one other companies likely do as well, I would just make sure it was a quality brand, watch some YouTube tutorials on different brands to help you pick your best fit & I bet you see a dramatic difference! OH. and make sure you at least moisturize before you leave the house every morning & wether you wear make up or not, always use a moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from damage.   I hope somewhere I said something that is at least a bit helpful. Don't firet though, it's absolutely something you're gonna be able to get control over pretty easily I think."

popping,3cvbdf,quetzalKOTL,3,Sat Jul 11 04:25:40 2015 UTC,"Those are probably just sebaceous filaments, not actual blackheads. If you try to remove them, they will just come back.  Exfoliating with BHA or AHA might help reduce the appearance of the pores, but you can't fully get rid of the filaments; that's just natural.  Frankly, your skin looks great to me. My cheek pores are larger than that! It bothers me a bit, so I'm going to start BHA once I break in my new cleanser, and hopefully that will help. But pores and SFs are normal and healthy."

The major fight is with the FDA. I happened to work in a world famous children's hospital, & dealing with getting proper consent from minors that's just one of the factors that makes things very difficult with the FDA & other powers that be (EPA when dealing with nuclear medicines & what not) but there's a lot going on behind the scenes thanks to patients willing to try anything for their own benefit & to hopefully for the benefit of others with their same conditions in years to come.

However, I will forever maintain that the truly brave & admirable people in any research department, no matter where in the world it may be or what is being studied, are the patients! I have the softest place in my heart for patients who look for more, hope to find better, & volunteer themselves for the benefit of anyone who suffers with the same conditions as them. Going into something, especially blind studies, that not only do you not know if it will work or not but you don't even know if you're receiving an active drug...to me that's bravery. I am so grateful for every patient that volunteers for research programs. There isn't enough compensation & no amount of ""thank you""'s we could ever give/say to truly express what a remarkably selfless act it is to not give up, to keep fighting, & to go through everything involved in research to help us doctors, nurses, lab techs & scientist hopefully find a cure, or at the very least a treatment. I hope the research program your son participated in was at the very least somewhat successful. No research department would be anything without our patients though; I'm humbled by the brave men, women, & especially children who allow us to do our job because of their sacrifice. Your son is a hero for participating in a research program & you're Super Mom for being on board & allowing your child to participate. I'm sure it wasn't always easy, the extra blood draws, extra scans, X-rays, & other various labs/test...it can be a bummer, to put it kindly.

I can tell you that I never worked on a study funded at all by the U.S. Military, nor have I heard of any, but that's certainly not to say it's not happening. A quick google search didn't render much helpful information either. I am extremely interested in what on earth the U.S. Military is doing funding medical research of a more rare condition in Australia. You would think they would start in thenUS first, considering just our population vs Australia's I would expect to see more cases in the larger country. My only guess would be that the money was managed by the military, there was likely some kind of deal that was reached & perhaps this study took place in Australia due to different laws, rules, & regulations. Do you remember the name of the trial your son was in? I have some resources at my disposal to pull & review most of the data that was discovered during medical research. Oh and per the patient privacy act that all medical employees are required to know inside & out, I won't & can't ask you for any indentifying information to determine which patient may be your son, but if you have the trial name I would love to look into more & check out what they discovered."

I was happy when the doctor ordered it because my dad had tubes repeatedly due to congenital defect, so I knew the drill.) a lot of language development takes place before the age of three years, and my son was talking as though he had a mouth full of rocks. for a month after the surgery he would sit there wide-eyed and speechless as we talked, as though he'd never heard us before. and then he started talking as clear as a bell, picking up vocabulary and constantly communicating. I think that muffled speech was all he was hearing.   A friend wasn't so lucky. Military doctors had done nothing for her boy's continuous infections. One weekend a civilian doctor was helping on base, and asked ""why doesn't this child have tubes?"" She said, ""you mean they can DO something for this?!"" He was five years old. He remained language-disabled. Don't know if the tubes would have saved him, but I feel they saved my son."

popping,3ci51d,darcyismyhomeboy,2,Wed Jul 8 05:14:15 2015 UTC,"The bigger ones tend to smell like death, and they do cause your breath to be quite sub-par. The smaller ones that are pictured didn't have a smell to them (yet), but of course, the longer they're in there the more chance they will smell. As stated before, I get these way more frequently than I'd like; the last time I knew I had them was when I was 16 and was getting over terrible tonsillitis. I don't plan on having a haul like this again, since I obsessively check every three days now. Also, the more alkaline/acidic your body is, the less likely you are to get these, since they're calcified food particles and such, so changing my diet has helped tremendously."

popping,3ce07k,autowikibot,11,Tue Jul 7 17:05:02 2015 UTC,"Sequestrum:       A sequestrum (plural: sequestra) is a piece of dead bone that has become separated during the process of necrosis from normal or sound bone.  It is a complication (sequela) of osteomyelitis. The pathological process is as follows:   infection in the bone leads to an increase in intramedullary pressure due to inflammatory exudates the periosteum becomes stripped from the osteum, leading to vascular thrombosis bone necrosis follows due to lack of blood supply sequestra are formed   The sequestra are surrounded by sclerotic bone which is relatively avascular (without a blood supply). Within the bone itself, the haversian canals become blocked with scar tissue, and the bone becomes surrounded by thickened periosteum.  Due to the avascular nature of this bone, antibiotics which travel to sites of infection via the bloodstream poorly penetrate these tissues, hence the difficulty in treating chronic osteomyelitis.  At the same time as this, new bone is forming (known as involucrum). Openings in this involucrum allow debris and exudates (including pus) to pass from the sequestrum via sinus tracts to the skin.  Rarely, a sequestrum may turn out to be an osteoid osteoma, a rare tumor of the bone.    Image i - An X-ray of a child's femur showing a bony sequestrum highlighted by the blue arrow.

You put ten drops into the ear, and lean your head to the side for five minutes.  If you hear crackling, that's the sound of it working.  After five minutes take a bulb syringe, which usually comes with the drops, and flush out your ear canal with really warm, almost hot water.  Best to point it slightly towards the roof of the ear canal, and then flush with as much pressure as you can.  Hope this helps."

Twisting the tick like this risks twisting off its head. The best method is simply to get a firm grasp as close to the skin using tweezers and firmly and steadily (i.e., do it carefully and avoid jerking it out) pulling outward. Then, clean the wound.   Most importantly, people, DO NOT TWIST THE TICK. This is a very, very bad method of tick removal.   Please, please, please do not purchase this unsafe product."

popping,3ca2o2,DoctorAwesomeBallz69,11,Mon Jul 6 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'm impressed at your pain tolerance. You have a right to do whatever you want. I do however question whether you helped your situation or potentially aggravated the situation.   Not a doc, but my unsolicited $0.02... When you get stitches from a doc, everything is/should be done so that the situation isn't made worse. Rarely, if ever, are sutures used to merely stop bleeding. They're usually used to close a wound for better healing / avoiding a scar. For your situation, I would guess that you probably used non-sterile and non-medical grade needle and sutures. (Clean does not equal sterile.) Effectively, you gave yourself 6 new holes where not-fun-organisms can be introduced into your bloodstream. And the needle and thread (?) probably had a few of those guys along for the ride, no matter how well you cleaned them.   If It were me, I would have applied pressure until the bleeding stopped, then cleaned out the area as best as possible (Bactine is your friend), then used butterfly band aids to close the hole if absolutely necessary.   Again, this is only my unsolicited $0.02. As much as possible, I don't intend to sound condescending or confrontational. If you just wanted an excuse to give yourself stitches, rock on. I don't have a problem with that."

popping,3ca2o2,pandroidgaxie,5,Mon Jul 6 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"Next time, or if the stitches become irritated and you have to take them out, try buying butterfly bandages at the drugstore and use those.

popping,3ca2o2,daryldickin,2,Wed Jul 8 08:10:52 2015 UTC,Pro tip: they use superglue in the emergency room as an alternative to stitches. Straight superglue. Works just as well. For next time.

Regardless, this is a good example of why penetration testing is so important for quality defensive ammunition. Clearly, an underpowered FMJ is not going to cut it."
popping,3cafgh,FrontSightFocus,2,Mon Jul 6 15:36:02 2015 UTC,The shirt and blood are kind of throwing me off but i have seen several vids where a bullet has worked its way out of the body. The bullet was not deformed at all and looked to have barely gone through a shirt so maybe they were far from whoever short them? 9mm and .380 pretty much have the same rounds but with a smaller charge on the .380. It is a parabellum round and does not look like a revolver round. Idk. I had really thought it was a nail when the video started.
popping,3cafgh,I-grow-strong-again,2,Mon Jul 6 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"I've seen similar videos, but that thing was so slow that it didn't tear/cut/punch/penetrate the t-shirt! It was going REALLY slow by the time it got to his skin.   You're correct. 9mm and .380 are the exact same round. The .380 has a shorter casing with less powder (obviously). (I should have been more specific with my description of the slug.)  I have heard several accounts of .380 barely penetrating heavy clothing (like a thick coat) and lodging superficially in the skin / fat; even from extremely close ranges. I'm guessing the round didn't deform because a) FMJ and b) only soft fabric and soft tissue.  If it penetrated heavy clothing, a JHP from the same gun might have never reached his skin. Just a bad bruise."

If it comes to a head or seems like it's coming to the surface then go to the doctor to have it removed properly. If the sac isn't removed it will more than likely come back with a vengeance.  I have dug holes in my skin before trying to remove sacs. It's not the easiest thing to do and it hurts. The doctor should at least numb it for you.

popping,3c58ps,whynowhyreally,17,Sat Jul 4 22:32:08 2015 UTC,Looks like a heat rash. I get them all the time because I require thick bra straps. It's very annoying. There are a bunch of home remedies online! The most common is to apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone cream if they become horribly itchy. I find popping them the best I can and then putting rubbing alcohol right after tends to make them go away faster. You should also wipe the sweat away as quickly as you can to stop it from sitting and stewing. Maybe use baby wipes or astringent pads. Sorry for the novel!
popping,3c58ps,elephantirrelephant,7,Sat Jul 4 22:43:38 2015 UTC,is it a no slip strap? it maybe your body reacting to it especially if its latex
popping,3c58ps,fungliah,3,Sun Jul 5 01:49:35 2015 UTC,Heat rash. I get this under my arms where my bra strap rides or the apex of my thighs where the hem of my panties meets the skin. I usually end up popping them and then putting hydrocortisone cream on the inflamed areas.   Your dermatologist may not coming lately agree with that but it works for me. I usually go a day or two without wearing whichever article of clothing caused it too just so the already sensitive skin isn't re-irritated and has time to heal.   Oh and I started using an oatmeal body soap not long ago and it works wonders.  Edit-spelling

popping,3c3ka4,MandalorianExistence,-5,Sat Jul 4 16:01:13 2015 UTC,"Your conclusion is not valid. Your sample size is roughly 5.35% of the population, assuming the number of subscribers to be the population. Claiming that ""there are indeed more men that are into popping pimples and stuff like that (at least on reddit)"" is a bold statement with such a small proportion of the population being sampled. I'm too lazy to do the math right now, but you need a much larger sample size to make such bold conclusions. My guess is somewhere around ~15,000 would be a decent sample size.  This survey could have happened to draw a larger proportion of women by random chance. Likewise, you need to account for confounding factors. Maybe guys are less likely to admit to being subbed to r/popping for reasons regarding self-consciousness/insecurity? Who knows what other factors could have led to the sample data you observed. Either way, your conclusion is not justified at all."

popping,3c2a9s,CosmicVomit,10,Sat Jul 4 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"I had chickenpox as a young adult.  Somehow, I'd escaped infection as a child, and the vaccine wasn't yet available.  I'm a pathological popper.  In fact, that's how I found the first blemish - I thought it was a pimple on my lower back.  But it didn't feel sore like a pimple nor did it pop like one.  I showed my mother, who immediately recognized it as chickenpox.    A full-blown chickenpox infection feels like the flu.  High fevers, sore throat, headache, severe lethargy.  I slept nearly around the clock for a week, my mother forcing me to take liquids as as I could. The blisters of chickenpox can form almost anywhere, and I had them inside my throat, which made eating & drinking difficult.   One of the ways that the virus can be spread from one area to the other is via contagion from the blister liquid.So, while chickenpox may look like a popper's dream, popping them should be avoided (for example, it would be potentially be disastrous for someone with a bad rash to accidentally rub their eyes) so as not to spread the blemishes.  But they don't pop like a pimple, so there's no real satisfaction anyway.    Also, you're just too sick to even care, anyway.  Besides, the best shot you have at avoiding scarring is to just leave them alone (which gets more difficult as they start healing and start to scab over and then really start to get itchy).  TL;DR: Chickenpox don't pop and if you have it, you DGAF about popping them, anyway."

popping,3bxszz,rbaltimore,3,Fri Jul 3 11:30:58 2015 UTC,"How the hell did the original OP know it was a Black Widow spider bite? And how did they not get sick? Bites from Lactrodectus bites are generally not fatal, but they aren't this innocuous.    Due to the presence of latrotoxin in their venom, black widow bites are potentially dangerous and may result in systemic effects (latrodectism) including severe muscle pain, abdominal cramps, hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, and muscle spasms. Symptoms usually last for 37 days, but may persist for several weeks.   I have several friends/acquaintances who've had black widow bites, and every one of them ended up in the hospital, absolutely miserable with pain."
popping,3bxszz,asgarnieu,9,Fri Jul 3 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'm very skeptical of this being a black widow. Brown recluse, sure. But black widows rarely hang out in houses, much less bite unless you are clearly threatening their space."
popping,3bxszz,achickendidit,2,Fri Jul 3 05:48:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Most North American Lactrodectus species are found outside, hanging tucked away from human activity, trying to avoid us - they are not aggressive like Phoneutria (Brazilian Wandering Spiders) and some Atracinae (Funnel Web Spiders). I have know a shockingly large number of people over the years who have been bitten by black widows - 4 people, all bitten by L. mactans.  Three people were bitten in a wilderness camp I went to every summer growing up, each time they had left their shoes outside of the cabin to dry overnight/for a few days and didn't check for 8 legged friends before putting their feet in. My former next door neighbor got bitten rooting around in the dark in his shed looking for a tool or something, he didn't see the web and spider in the corner.  They all developed lactrodectism pretty quickly, and they all were able to bring the spider to the hospital with them."
popping,3bxszz,pandroidgaxie,4,Fri Jul 3 13:07:25 2015 UTC,Even less likely that it'd be a brown recluse. A recluse doesn't just bite to bite. One would need to be smashed against skin to provoke a bite. This is almost certainly a staph infection of some sort.
popping,3bxszz,achickendidit,13,Fri Jul 3 06:12:53 2015 UTC,Poison Center nurse here.  The majority of 'spider bites' are not spider bites.  The scenario is not at all typical of a black widow bite.  Never heard of a dry black widow bite;  one will not feel the bite but within 15-60 minutes one will get horrible abdominal muscle pain treated with a lot of benzos and opiates. Think you have a spider bite?  It's most likely MRSA from another source.  Doctors and nurses know this and don't even argue about it anymore.
popping,3bxszz,Tallywacka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:41:32 2015 UTC,"You nailed it, of course. An edit to the imgur album now notes at the bottom that it was a staph infection.  Wish I had a dollar for every youtube video claiming an abscess was from a ""spider bite."""

popping,3bxszz,Aidsagain,2,Fri Jul 3 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know, I got that. I was pointing out that the original OP was NOT bitten by a black widow. She was not hospitalized due to horrible symptoms, and black widows never deliver dry bites. You are correct - in all my years of being terrified of spiders (which ended 10 years ago, I used my grad social work degree to cure my phobia), and my remaining years of being fascinated by spiders, I have NEVER seen one inside. They like cool, damp places, and generally, you don't have those inside."

popping,3by9ha,truthhurtsbitch1,32,Fri Jul 3 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"Monday, something bit/stung/something my face near my eye. Within 24 hours my eye swelled almost shut. A trip to urgent care got me steroid cream, antibiotics, and a steroid/antibiotic eye drop. The swelling continued until I could hardly see out of the eye.   Today, after a hot compress, I went into my bathroom to take a look. There was a massive white ""mine"" under the scab of the bite. Imagine my shear delight when I wondered if it would pop. Imagine the horror when I realized how bad that sumabitch was going to hurt.   Ever so carefully, I took my needle nose tweezers and barely tugged at the corner of dried skin. It pulled just enough to open it up.   It oozed. Not enough to get excited, it could just be some pus from the wound that needs to be cleaned away and treated with some antibiotic cream.   Very carefully, I position myself over my magnifying mirror. I have to make sure the light is reflecting onto my eye, I have horrible vision and I can't wear my contacts because of this shit. I also can't see outside of a small window of margin with the eye I'm working on. So I have to be practically on top of the mirror.   I take my fingers and place them around the area, due to the swelling, they're a good 2 inches apart, and I don't think anything is going to happen other than a lot of fucking pain.   I squeeze, so gently that when it erupted I stop out of shock. I quickly wipe what little I have away, and go in for another go. This time, I put more pressure down and get brace for the coming pain. I squeeze and it was a thing of popping beauty. That bitch just spurted out a quarter sized blob of semi-solid, white goop. I clean it up, since at this point I can't see my work space and I go in for another round.   This time there's more resistance and I have to squeeze harder. I'm rewarded with another quarter sized glop, this one is just firm enough to get stuck, and I have to use my tweezers to pull it away.   It was awesome. Something I've never seen in person. And I didn't get it on video. I didn't even get a photo. I had no way to do it on my own and no other adult in the house to help me.   I'm so sorry. I have sinned against you all.   ETA: I found this pic on google. no idea who it is."

I wasn't willing to squeeze harder, I think it all came out in that first go. My whole eye is itching like a mother fucker so I think it's finally healing. I just wanna rub the fuck out of it. lol"

popping,3bviep,gotbannedtoomuch,2,Fri Jul 3 08:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's called DNA.  Edit: Actually, it's the lack thereof rather, or more like the lack of the ""coaching"" those stem cells needed to be properly assigned to their correct function. Basically, our DNA had a little ""gone wild"" moment called a mutation, these mutations are constantly happening though, so there is no reason to worry about them, it's just that every once in a while, these mutations are markedly noticeable.   Every cell in our bodies begins from what are called stem cells, these cells are found in embryonic formation, and they are basically the cells that can become any sort of other cell for any sort of tissue in our body. A Teratoma is formed when a germ cell (egg or a sperm) thinks its a an embryonic stem cell, but the DNA isn't doing what it's supposed to do, so this rogue cell begins to grow in a way that it shouldn't and it develops as something that displays certain characteristics of a fetus trying to form, but not exactly. They are a bit of a mystery, and they sort of just are what they are. But they are fully encapsulated, usually present from birth, but slow growing and almost always benign.. they are just extremely disgusting. Tera latin for monster, and Oma is the usual medical suffix used to indicate a type of tumor.. So Teratoma means Monster tumor.   What defines a Teratoma as opposed to a dermoid cyst (which are similar) is that tissues from all three embryonic germ layers are usually present, which means, in theory, you could literally find anything inside of one: A partially formed heart valve, or bronchi (the hard tubes that form our airway), bone, hair, teeth, fully formed sebaceous glands, liver tissue, and in rare cases, maybe even something resembling a hand, or other extremity.  And yes, if one contained fully formed sebaceous glands, I'm sure the smell would more than compliment the appearance.  Anyways, hope that helps a bit. And sorry, not enough coffee before the edit."

I'll be happy to talk openly and honestly about all phases of taking a person from a Jigger Victim to a Jigger Survivor. Thank you in advance to anyone who is interested! 游땕"

popping,3bphyk,pandroidgaxie,4,Wed Jul 1 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"So, apparently these are parasites that live in the dirt in sub-Saharan areas. Many people do not have shoes, or they wear sandals and they can easily start to burrow through the skin. I found a website called solehope.org which has links where you can have a ""shoe cutting"" party, to create shoes that cover the entire foot so that the parasites cannot reattach."
popping,3bphyk,Elethor,6,Wed Jul 1 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"they have to treat the house and yard to kill the off-host stages as well. The imbedded jiggers are the ones that produce the eggs, so both the body and the home require ongoing effort to break the cycle and keep the situation from returning. Dirt floors are a problem because they love the sand.   Regarding healing, eventually the wound surface will heal and healthy skin will grow over it, though it may still have a slight dent."

popping,3bphyk,pandroidgaxie,3,Wed Jul 1 03:57:25 2015 UTC,"This comes up when people post jigger videos here, kind of a mixed review. Some people like them, others don't. Some of the people who remove the jiggers mostly scrape and others mostly dig, and some jiggers are big and round and are sort of nudged out while others are stringy, sticky things that are a slimy mess to remove. Regardless, they can't really be popped out. I like the videos, but get why others do not. Plus, lots of stuff in this sub aren't popping (snot, blister pics, etc) and I look at those, too. Shrug."
popping,3bphyk,Link9454,2,Wed Jul 1 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, when I first saw jigger videos I was annoyed by the non-popping scraping. Eunice's case is remarkable for its' trypophobia effect; never seen a foot so infested that the removal leaves an actual honeycomb of holes.  But to get a glimpse of jiggers that are kind of like a pop, take a look at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SdWQg7-s80  From 0-3:30 is just prep, and the first intact jiggers, which are like intact cysts, start coming out around 6:53 (but not a great view angle.) At 7:56 the first ""contents under pressure"" jigger is pierced - it's not a huge spurt, more like a minor pimple. But right afterward the intact jiggers start coming out, and that's the cool part. The ""shocking"" intact jiggers event occurs after 11:10. First time I watched it, I was horrified. Backed up and watched it again. And after that I was hooked, lol."

popping,3bphyk,epoch_eclipse,5,Wed Jul 1 06:49:48 2015 UTC,"there are some medicines that treat other ectoparasites, but tests have shown them ineffective for Tunga penetrans (""jiggers"".) Some new topicals are currently being tested but not yet available, and may not be cost effective.  Research shows that tungiasis (jigger infestation) is always poverty-related; usually elderly folks or neglected children. Dirt floors are a huge problem because the off-host development stages love a sandy environment. Treatment has to include the environment as well as extractions to stop the life cycle. Education is also essential. Shoes alone don't solve the problem (it's been studied.) So it requires real effort just to get one family/household pulled up out of the problem."
popping,3bphyk,saulhrnndz,3,Wed Jul 1 11:17:53 2015 UTC,"By internal I assume you mean ingested or injected. They are on your flesh, and on an extremity, so topical is the way to go since taking medicine would give a very low concentration compared to the rest of your body (and probably make you sick before the insect). Unfortunately, it also would leave the insect body in the flesh, which means that the big problem (infection) still remains.  As for prevention, controlling the insects in living areas with stuff like diatomaceous earth might be good, but keeping that up over such a wide area is futile. Shoes and some way of keeping them out of homes are the ways to go."

popping,3bphyk,sudo-intellectual,8,Wed Jul 1 06:16:05 2015 UTC,"I, too, find all the ""thank God"" posts to be self-aggrandizing or ostentatious. However, the individuals going out into the field and dealing with the smell of infected feet as well as the physical work have in general volunteered because of their religious belief. They might not be doing this without that inspiration. So I try to be respectful of the volunteers and the motivation which brought them out to do this."

popping,3bm6wp,badass4102,55,Tue Jun 30 13:00:05 2015 UTC,"They may be the holes left after Canthariden ( blister maker) is used to remove warts. Warts are in the top layer of the skin. Canthariden irritates the bottom layer and causes the attachment between the bottom layer and the wart layer to break down and those layers separate, with the wart being on the top surface and a layer of plasma in between. The canthariden is dissolved in collodion (medical name for airplane glue) and painted on the wart all the way to the edge, let dry and covered. A few days later the blister has formed and is allowed to rise and the doctor then deflates it after he is sure the  downwards bulge of the wart has disconnected, and removes it and the wound is covered. These look like plantar warts. These are common  warts than cannot bulge up, because the plantar surface is where you plant your feet = the sole of your foot. As you walk on it, it grows and is pushed up into the foot. This often hurts, and when the blister forms = deep hole. It is the best procedure for plantar warts, since = very deep, and you do not want deep holes burned into the sole of your foot = tendons and bones are close by. here is a reference  and a few more clickable images, some like the OP  Canthariden is a very powerful blister agent. It is not used for sexual stimulation - it does the opposite it burns. Ranchers used to take a very very dilute suspension of a few of the flies (the so called Spanis Fly it comes from) it is extracted from to paint on the vulva of cows = it swells and attracts the bulls. The farmers use 0.00001%. Medical collodion is 1% = very very dangerous, and needs triple gloves because it can penetrate 1 glove because of the solveen in the collodion."

With each use, the blades get duller, causing irritation at the hair roots, so they get inflamed, meaning they're even more likely to get irritated the next time you shave. If changing razors more often doesn't work, I'd recommend waiting until these wounds heal up completely, then using Magic Shave. It's like Nair, except it doesn't chemically burn your flesh or leave you smelling like rotten eggs. Get REGULAR strength and not the extra strength, it works plenty well!"

I go back to the doctor on Thursday if there is no improvement or on Monday if it is starting to feeling better. I am very careful with my eyes.

I used to go to the doctor to get them frozen/cut off but now I just do it myself.  You can either use a wart acid paste stuff that you apply every day for a week or so or you can freeze it off. With the paste it will form a callus type of covering and it will peel of after a few days. Then using a knife you can cut out the wart (which might hurt really bad) or you can keep applying  the paste stuff.  By freezing it if you do it 2 or 3 times for warts that size they usually go away with no scaring.  My favorite method is the paste because you get to peel off the callus. But take care of the warts while they are that size because sometimes they get out of hand and they can get really big and deep and will hurt really bad.  Usually they go away on their own but it's fun to take care of them. Just be careful not to touch that wart to and cuts or thin areas of skin because they can spread really easily and you'll have warts all over

popping,3be6gv,ChicagoMemoria,4,Mon Jun 29 00:44:51 2015 UTC,Only painful around the top part where the skin underneath is more raw. And not that painful at that.   Last night I slept without a bandage on and the peeled off skin (which is pretty thick) dried up. Now I can't stop touching the edges of the flap and trying to crease it (It won't crease but seems like it should).
popping,3bghxa,notastepfordwife,4,Mon Jun 29 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have a layer of skin ready to peel, so when you sweat, the liquid can't escape. This makes small blister-like bubbles under the dead skin."

popping,3bgog9,ladyhelena,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's the most likely I think. I would see a Dr. though, since you said it grew suddenly. Moles shouldn't do that. Are you taking any blood thinners? That would cause a lot of bleeding. It could be something just random, too. Better safe than sorry though."

popping,3bgog9,stumbleweed,2,Mon Jun 29 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"ok, just checking, haha.  I think you might want to go see Dr. Derm on this one. It's probably nothing but not bad to check it out nonetheless. The bleeding seems a little unusual (though I am definitely no veteran of this sub.)"
popping,3bgog9,LaughingAtIdiots,2,Mon Jun 29 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"I was planning on seeing the doc about it if it hasn't lessened or gone away in a few days..It doesn't hurt or itch at all..But it's right in the spot of my back I can barely reach, and it's taking everything I can muster not to pick or pop it, and it's driving me crazy!...I just know how much it will bleed. I went through 6 folded extra absorbent paper towels, a thick folded pressure/bleeding pad and several band-aids. Soaked right through them all..It took 2 hours of laying on an ice pack to finally get it to slow down enough to put another bandage on it without it soaking through."
popping,3bgog9,stumbleweed,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"Man, that's odd. I'm really curious about why something could bleed so bad. Do your cuts and scrapes bleed a lot?"
popping,3bgog9,stumbleweed,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"Nope..That's why it's so strange. I don't have any blood or bleeding conditions that would cause it to bleed so easily for so long..The only thing I could think of that could bleed like that is maybe a wart. But I don't suspect it's a wart..It came on quick like a zit, feels like a zit to the touch, but if I pop it, there's no puss..Just blood...Lots and lots of blood.."

popping,3b8hth,BlackAndDeckHer,18,Sat Jun 27 12:16:20 2015 UTC,"Well what happened was my first daughter we spent 26 hours in the hospital delivery room waiting for her to come. This one my wife decided that she was going to let me rest a little while longer since it was midnight and she wants to have our kids at an amazing hospital an hour away. We drove she screamed the whole time. Pulled in told security to get ready for my wife and unborn child. Get her in on a wheel chair. Douche still makes us pull out our drivers license for security purposes. Wife starts to scream as if someone is pulling her finger nails out. He opens the automatic doors and starts calling over the intercom that we're on our way and met by 10 nurses asking if she was out yet. Nope cya in a bit. Change my wife in the initial screening room. She's fully dilated with contractions 2-5 min apart. They leave....and forget about us. I walk out 15 min later asking why the fuck the room isn't ready yet.  ""Oh I'm sorry I thought so and so bitch took you there sorry"". Get to other room they start to get an IV ready wife tells her to fuck off. 10 min later big contraction I look down there and I see something poking out. It's just me my wife and douche nurse that didn't get us into our room. Calls for help since she has no idea what the fuck to do it seemed like.  All the other nurses finally get in there and start the whole ""don't push the doctors not here yet"". My wife told me labor is not at all voluntary it just happens when it pushes you just do it. so someone telling you not to is like that awful moment when you have to shit and its started to prairie dog and you know it's gonna come no matter what you do. She pushed one last time as I said in the last one dumb ass didn't have gloves on so my kid hit the table rather than held. Fuck incompetent nurses."

popping,3b8hth,kltbc,39,Sat Jun 27 00:09:30 2015 UTC,"It was posted on medical website not long ago. It was from an elective c-section. If you have the c-section before labor, the waters havent broken yet. You cut through the uterus, and the amniotic sac is there... it's a fairly tough membrane, so if you're very gentle, you can lift the baby out ""en caul"" like this.

Many doctors/hospitals will break the amniotic sac because it can make labor go faster.   Things I have heard about babies in the caul: Blessed by G-d. See the future. Never drown. Have telepathy.  Well, my daughter is ten now. She hasn't drowned. Haven't seen any signs of telepathy or future-telling."

popping,3b9coz,mogar99,2,Sun Jun 28 09:29:13 2015 UTC,It was originally 500 but he modded it by taking out some restrictors or something. I don't know the technicalities about it but he had a huge bottle of green gas originally for paint ball guns. It used so much used per shot this big ass can would be empty after about 75 or so shots.  Story was I had his rifle and I was at the top of a tree house with a ramp at front. I heard him coming up the wood and just stuck the rifle out the door and laid on the triggers. He had about 15 shots from his bicep to his ankle. Only one on his bicep became this ugly thing.

But last year I got more curious and read up on maggots. Turns out only SOME maggots are polite enough to eat dead flesh vs. live. In the meantime, there are other less pleasant maggots that will happily bore a hole into your healthy flesh if you give them an opening. . (Professional medical maggots are lab-raised to be germ and microbe-free. Studies recently conducted objectively by national governments found that their performance isn't any better than modern treatment. And found that even the most polite maggots eventually turn carnivorous, enlarging the wound and causing pain by eating destructively into healthy flesh.)"
