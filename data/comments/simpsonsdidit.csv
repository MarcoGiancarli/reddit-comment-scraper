simpsonsdidit,3cc0pg,foxsix,4,Tue Jul 7 18:07:55 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXC_205E3Og  I found this review of Inside out to be on point with discussing Inside Out. Has Pixar lost their creative touch?
simpsonsdidit,3cc0pg,shufflebuffalo,3,Tue Jul 7 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge pixar fan myself, but I think the reviewer kind of missed the point of the movie.  He says: ""The way she winds up being controlled she might as well have extreme bipolar disorder.""  Exactly -- maybe she does. Or maybe she's a moody teenager going through a rough time in her life. I think it fundamentally is a movie for children, but it does a great job of illustrating how we don't have total control over our thoughts and emotions (even when we think we do), and gives us a sense of what might be going on with mental illness. Of course, all of this is at a level meant to be understood by children, so it's a little silly.  Also, I don't really get the idea of ""this is a movie for children, but a lot of adults like these movies so I'm going to apply adult movie standards while critiquing it."" Okay...but...it's still a children's movie. If adults want to watch it that's their business, but the people who created it made it for children."
simpsonsdidit,3cc0pg,foxsix,11,Tue Jul 7 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Has Pixar lost their creative touch?   Nah. The idea of ""voices are people in your head"" has been around for a long time. The fact that Pixar executed it well, and for an hour and a half movie, is surprising.  Most ideas are unoriginal. Someone's done everything. It's like Rule 34, but with plots."
simpsonsdidit,3cc0pg,robotortoise,4,Tue Jul 7 06:16:01 2015 UTC,Inside Out had a pretty unique look on an old idea and ended up being pretty entertaining and even meaningful. I'd say this is marking the return of Pixar from movies like Cars.

simpsonsdidit,3cc0pg,Giga-man,3,Mon Jul 6 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"People need to understand, nothing is original. Pretty much any 'original' idea, if you look deep enough, has stolen from any number of previous ideas.  And that is OKAY. It is okay for an idea to not be 100% pure original; if anything the important thing is the devil in the details, changing the underlying details can drastically change how an idea plays out, and even turn ideas that seem 'meh' or crappy into something amazing and fantastic."

simpsonsdidit,39l4zx,chaserjames,6,Fri Jun 12 20:25:42 2015 UTC,Can you really just drive through corn at the speeds they were going? Even in a truck? It's been a while since I saw the movie but IIRC they were doing like 50+ MPH. I would have thought the ride would be extremely bumpy and it would just rip the nose to shreds.
simpsonsdidit,39l4zx,capn_untsahts,6,Fri Jun 12 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the field and the truck.  The problem is not with the corn but with the field itself not being flat like a road would be.  If it's dry enough though, it could flatten itself out enough to let you go fast enough.  Edit:  Here's the closest video I could find to something similar."

In addition, the winner of the house, if they chose to occupy it, was contractually obligated to repaint the exterior in accordance with local homeowner's association rules.[9] Contest entries were included on various Pepsi products and 15 million were submitted nationally.[3] The winner was Barbara Howard from Richmond, Kentucky.[10] Howard chose not to accept the house, instead taking a cash payment per the contest rules.[10] In 2001, after most of the details relating to the television series were removed, the house was sold by the builder to another owner.[3]  The house, located in a subdivision that was permanently named ""Springfield South Valley Ranch"",[3] took 49 days to build and was unveiled to the public on August 1, 1997.[9][11] Construction on the house was nearly complete by July 1997,[12] and by September 1997 thousands of people were lining up to see the finished product.[13] During the time it was open to the public in August and September 1997, more than 30,000 people visited the house,[3] including The Simpsons creator Matt Groening.[14]   Adjusting for inflation the house would cost roughly $176,000 in 2015.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_house#Real-life_version"

The episode is the 257th episode overall and the ninth episode of the twelfth season (the BABF production line). In the episode, while working as a human guinea pig (to pay off the family's lost savings after making a bad investment), Homer discovers the root cause of his subnormal intelligence: a crayon that was lodged in his brain ever since he was six years old. He decides to have it removed to increase his IQ, but soon learns that being intelligent is not always the same as being happy.    Image i     Interesting: Firefly (website) | Mike B.

simpsonsdidit,351uc1,Ironbird420,6,Wed May 6 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"Millions is a vast understatement 3% of the US workforce are commercial truck drivers. The more interesting ramifications are that trucking is essentially the last menial job on the planet that pays not only living, but decent wage. I honestly don't ever see the US government allowing the essential elimination of that much of the workforce that quickly. FMCSA regulations only allow a someone to drive 11 hours without a break of 10 hours between. That's quite literally doubling productivity with automation.

It's never actually explain how he's related to the Bouvier family, like whether he was the uncle of Marge and her sisters, thus making him Bart, Lisa and Maggie's great-uncle, or if he was the brother of the Bouvier sisters. He was only mentioned in the fifth season episode, The Boy Who Knew Too Much, by Marge, who told Bart that he used to have a saying, ""Shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out,"" until one day he put his theory into practice, and ""it took 75 federal marshals to bring him down."" Shortly afterward, she briefly alluded to him to Bart when cautioning him about listening to voices in his head, as he did on one December morning (implied to be the same day he decided to put his saying into practice). Arthur seems to be a source of shame and embarrassment to the family.  After Marge finished telling Arthur's story to Bart, she said, ""Now let's never speak of him again."" The references to voices inside his head imply that he was mentally ill, presumably Schizophrenic.

simpsonsdidit,2xnu8x,Nowhere_Man_Forever,-14,Mon Mar 2 12:49:34 2015 UTC,"To put into perspective how big of a difference that is, imagine if you were baking a cake and it called for 1 and a quarter cups of flour, and you used 7 and 3 quarter cups instead. It would be disasterous. Another example is if you had a weight that was labeled 7.75 lbs but was really 1.25 lbs. Quite a big difference. The only way Homer was ""close"" is that his answer was of the same order of magnitude, which isn't surprising when you consider that the second term is of the order of -16 and the planck mass is of the order of magnitude of 19 , meaning that their product will be in the hundreds of GeV range, which is probably when 1/137 was raised to the 8th- so that this would be the case (calculations predicted that the mass would be in this range well before Homer).

The term (1/137)8 is a double meaning- the term 1/137 is an approximation of the fine structure constant, which has to do with magnetism between elementary particles. The other meaning for this number is that the Hebrew word ""Kaballah"" has a numerological value of 137, which makes the number very important in esoterism. I think the 8 is just there because they wanted an exponent. The term inside the radical is a wrong form of the Planck mass, which is a unit for mass derived from universal constants for the ratio of energy to wavelength, the speed of light in a vacuum, and gravity."

simpsonsdidit,2xnu8x,Lacriphage,3,Mon Mar 2 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"First, this is not a good prediction of the Higgs mass.  If you plug in the values you get 775 GeV (or if you replace h with ћ then you get 308 GeV/c2, while the Higgs mass is 125.7 +/- 0.4 GeV.  Second as to where the equation comes from its rather simple.  The Planck mass is m_p = sqrt(hc/G) -- it's the only way you can take the fundamental constants h (Planck), c (speed of light), G (gravitation) and combine them together to get a mass.  This has meaning in physics; very roughly it's the particle mass where you really need to a theory of quantum gravity (and can't just use quantum mechanics and ignore gravity).  Traditionally, you should use ћ (ћ = h/2pi)  in the Planck mass, and then the Planck mass is m = 1.22 x 1019 GeV/c2.  But if you use h (as written in the Simpsons), then you get m = 3.06 x 1019 GeV/c2.   1/137 is a well-known approximation to the fine structure constant that often appears in quantum electrodynamics.  It basically dictates how strongly electrically charged particles couple to photons and is e2/(hbar c) in CGS units.  It is a unitless constant (doesn't have units of mass, charge, etc).  So you can basically throw it into an equation to divide by about 100 for free.  For several theoretical reasons, it was known for a long time that the Higgs should be in the 100-1000 GeV/c2 range.  E.g., this 2007 compilation of Higgs mass predictions ranging from show many limits on the Higgs to be less than 400-1000 GeV/c2 that existed before 1997.  So to get it into the ~100-100 GeV/c2 range you multiply by 1/137 8 times and the Simpsons writers threw an extra pi for good measure.  (Even if they left off the pi they'd get either ~247 GeV/c2 or ~ 98 GeV/c2).  So if you calculate pi * (1/137)8 * sqrt(h c/G) you get 775 GeV/c2.  If you use the actual Planck mass (with hbar) then you get 308 GeV/c2 Higgs mass.  For the record, the LHC discovered it to be 125.7 +/- 0.4 GeV/c2.  I have no idea why this got picked up in the media, other than the media sucking at science."

It is related to the electromagnetic coupling constant g, which characterizes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the electromagnetic field, by the formula g2 = 4πε0α. Being a dimensionless quantity, it has the same numerical value in all systems of units. Arnold Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant in 1916.

Now nuclear...nuclear is the only clean, efficient, and reliable energy source on the planet.  The steam ""waste"" put off by nuclear has a radioactive half-life of TWO MINUTES, meaning that within hours of its production, it is harmless.  Compare that to the fact that coal-fired plants (a very common energy source in the US) puts of a waste which contains a finite number of particles--particles which will never decay as the radioactive steam does.    Sadly, no one will listen to me when I tell them that radioactive power production is the cleanest, safest, most efficient energy source on the world.  But look at the body count!  How many have died in coal accidents, vs nuclear accidents.  How is nuclear waste affecting society, vs the waste produced by coal plants.  And let's rule out Chernobyl, as that was less of a ""nuclear"" accident and more of a ""Russian"" accident."

And even if Nuclear was 100% safe, we've reached the limit were renewable energy is on par with, if not even cheaper than Nuclear and it's costing less every minute.  Now you might say ""it's not reliable enough"",  but it actually is.  Wind and solar energy is dependent on wheather, when it doesn't blow it won't create any energy, but when it does blow a lot it'll provide excess energy that we can store in water to use in the damms around us."

BS 8300 is the British Standard that deals with disabled access, and gives the standard designs for tactile paving, heights of disabled access points (tables etc.), and ramp designs.  The ramps need to be flat at any turns, need to ideally be 1.8m in width (so two wheelchairs may pass each other), and they can't be too long before having a rest point (switchback designs like this are a workaround for this). The barriers have rules too and you mustn't be able to roll off the edge of a ramp.  All of this makes design very strict and you end up with ramps like this. As this was a council endeavour, they had to accommodate future tenants, not just stick a 1 in 6 ramp in and have the wheelchair user just get her strength up or get a running start"

Greg Palast (not sure how credible he actually is, but he raises some interesting issues) even wrote a book on potential problems, and although he focused on inaccurate purges of minorities, the lack of paper trails in electronic machines was mentioned by him and several other watchdogs.  2012 may have been the first hard evidence of voting machines changing votes, but that possibility was well documented before the Simpsons episode."

Many of these Austrian wines were exported to Germany, some of them in bulk to be bottled at large-scale German bottling facilities. At these facilities, some Austrian wines were illegally blended into German wines by the importers, resulting in diethylene glycol ending up in some bulk-bottled German wines as well.

simpsonsdidit,2f0yo6,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Aug 30 19:19:01 2014 UTC,"Homer the Vigilante:       ""Homer the Vigilante"" is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons' fifth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 1994. In the episode, a crime wave caused by an elusive cat burglar hits Springfield. Lisa is distraught to find her saxophone has been stolen, and Homer promises to get it back. The police are ineffective, so Homer takes charge of a neighborhood watch. However, under his leadership it becomes more like a vigilante group, and fails to catch the burglar. With the help of Grampa, Homer discovers that the burglar is a charming senior named Molloy. Molloy is arrested, but he outwits the citizens of Springfield and escapes.

You have episodes fairly early on where homer and marge almost have affairs, where homer gets drunk and humiliates marge at a party by oggling maude in her party dress, the one where homer is falsly accused as a sex offender, any tree house of horrors episode, and so on and so forth.   Also if you rewatch the early seasons springfield is a much more dank and terrible place. Moes isn't just depressing for laughs it's played straight as a cesspool of miserable assholes, and then there are the police. Wiggum is lovably incompetent in current seasons, but in the first 8 or so the force is legitimately fully and outright corrupt.  Sounds like it's time for you to do another rewatch.

However, he soon becomes sick of the job and comes close to quitting. One day, Krusty runs up and says he needs to use Bart in a sketch. Bart becomes an accidental star when he says, ""I didn't do it"" during the botched sketch. He becomes famous for his catchphrase but soon becomes tired of being known for one line.

simpsonsdidit,227d6c,GoNmanne11,-1,Sat Apr 12 00:40:53 2014 UTC,Family guy quest for stuff is not a rip off of Tapped out. As Both shows are owned by Fox. Fox asked EA to make the Simpsons game and due to its success decided to make a family guy version but asked tiny co to create instead of EA. The games are essentially the same but the game is belongs to fox it is their ip and they can made as many versions as they like. It wouldn't surprise me if in the future there will be an American Dad or Futurama version. Can People stop whining about how one is a copy of the other because they are both Fox.

In the episode, the Simpsons build a tennis court in their backyard and are ridiculed by the entire town because of Homer's inferior tennis ability. Homer therefore tries to please Marge by entering the two into a tournament, but they quickly turn into rivals when Marge replaces Homer with Bart as her partner.

The episode is the 257th episode overall and the last episode produced for the eleventh season (the BABF production line). In the episode, while working as a human guinea pig (to pay off the family's lost savings after making a bad investment), Homer discovers the root cause of his subnormal intelligence: a crayon that was lodged in his brain ever since he was six years old. He decides to have it removed to increase his IQ, but soon learns that being intelligent is not always the same as being happy.    Image i     Interesting: Mike B.

When you watch the Simpsons with the audio commentary on the DVD's you always hear the writers and producers explain, ""OK, we stole the plot of this book, we stole the plot of this movie, we stole the plot of this show."" They never try to play innocent or lie about it. I'm not picking on Community here specifically. It's just the Simpsons has been so influential it's become ubiquitous. I just wish people would acknowledge this more. All anyone ever wants to do is compare the lackluster (non-golden years) seasons to other show's best seasons. Then pretend like the Simpsons had nothing to do with shaping society in the 90's. It drives me mad."
simpsonsdidit,1za15p,OoogaOoogaYoink,27,Sat Mar 1 18:15:48 2014 UTC,"Community ""borrows"" material from TV and film pretty unabashedly.

Well, my biggest fear..."", it would have ruined the joke by drawing it out too long."
simpsonsdidit,1za15p,GinDeMint,9,Sat Mar 1 21:40:37 2014 UTC,Yeah... I totally agree with OoogaOoogaYoink that more shows should admit stuff like this but Community specifically is pretty transparent about borrowing from other sources. Half the time Abed mentions where it's coming from directly.

They ripped off so many shows, characters and movies and in the DVD commentaries, etc they're COMPLETELY transparent about it and talk about where the influences come from and how much they love them (looking at you, Twilight Zone).  As a kid growing up in the 90s I would watch all these Simpsons episodes, and then years later see the movies or TV shows and think man, this is really familiar. I was watching some newer episodes of Family Guy the other day (eugh) and they ripped off It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in one episode - and all I could think of was, man, Simpsons did it, and they did it way better. It was a great parody and a great episode, and I love the original movie - it's one of my favorites, but the Simpsons put a unique spin on it and made it fun."

Maybe they saw it ten years ago and don't even remember what show it was, but that's where the idea came from.   I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People aren't obligated to constantly pay homage to every funny thing they encounter and later incorporate into their work.

She was the cousin of Bo and Luke, the main protagonists of the show, who were also cousins, and the three lived on a farm on the outskirts of Hazzard County with their Uncle Jesse  Although never mentioned in the series itself, some press material for the show suggests that Daisy's parents, along with Bo and Luke's, were killed in a car accident. However, in the 1997 reunion movie, Daisy says her mother died when she was born.  Daisy would frequently become involved in the Dukes' car chases, originally her Plymouth Road Runner or, from the mid-second season onwards and more famously, her Jeep. Daisy also worked as a waitress at the Boar's Nest, the local bar owned by Boss Hogg that was the main meeting place in Hazzard.

Schaffner. It stars Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier and features James Mason, Lilli Palmer, Uta Hagen and Steve Guttenberg in supporting roles. The screenplay by Heywood Gould is based on the novel of the same name by Ira Levin.  The film was produced by Martin Richards and Stanley O'Toole with Robert Fryer as executive producer. The music score was by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Henri Decaë. It was produced through Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It was nominated for three Academy Awards.  The film was shot on location in Austria, England, Portugal, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It was Schaffner's second sci-fi film, appearing ten years after Planet of the Apes.     Picture  image source | about | /u/DoorMarkedPirate can reply with 'delete'.

simpsonsdidit,1tch0e,tweaq,9,Fri Dec 20 21:35:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the way the post is worded is confusing.  The post is showing a chair you can't fail back on (NOT Edison's version - probably a modern one).  The subreddit is ""simpsons did it"" so it is implied that the poster is saying that the simpsons made a chair you can't fall back on prior to this modern one being invented.  He then added in his title a reference to the episode where it happens - that Edison did it first.  So the order of things happening with regard to the untippable chair: First, Edison Did it. Then Simpsons Did it (And referenced Edison doing it). Then whoever made the pictured chair did it. Then OP posted that chair and referenced simpsons doing it (and them referencing Edison doing it).    Make sense now?"

This is one of the scenes that was cut for the rerun.   I didn't realize this until a year or two ago when I was rewatching the old episodes on dvd. Every once in a while there would be a scene that I didn't remember. Since I've seen the first 10 seasons way too many times already, I thought my memory just sucked. Turns out, I'd just been watching the reruns for years and didn't realize they were edited down."
