imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,TheMightyGoatMan,3,Mon Jul 20 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the 4E map for Sigil because it didn't make sense for a torus, but this one also doesn't make sense. It manages to fit the two halves to each other, but not the top and bottom edges."
imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,Qichin,3,Mon Jul 20 22:53:41 2015 UTC,It's the inside of the torus. The top and bottom don't meet.
imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,TheMightyGoatMan,3,Mon Jul 20 23:58:20 2015 UTC,"From the way I understood Sigil to work, it's a closed-off torus, with the city filling the entire inside. So it wraps around twice, so to speak - once length-wise along the ring, once in the vertical cross-section. So the top and bottom would have to meet. In fact, it shouldn't matter if it's the inside or the outside.  Essentially, you can walk a full circle in two planes and end up where you started."
imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,Qichin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"My understanding - as per the image at the top of this map- is that Sigil is just on the inner surface of the torus. Like in the hole of a donut. You can walk around the ring and loop back, but if you walk at right angles you hit the edge of the city.  I suppose you could leave the city, keep walking around the outside of the torus (if there's gravity there) and come back into the city, but there's a big empty space to cross which isn't covered by the maps."
imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,Myrilath,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"Which is why I find that image confusing, because that goes against everything that I've read about the city. It's closed off to the outside (in fact, there is no outside), and the only way to get into it is through portals. Having that gap makes no sense, lore-wise.  I've come to be very careful in my trust with maps, because the people paid to draw the maps are not the people who designed the places, and may have to rely on confusing descriptions."
imaginarymaps,3dyxb1,Qichin,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely open. There is an outside. It is quasi-extradimensional to its location. It lies at the top of the spire in the centre of the outlands. But is also in its own plane. Falling through the whole (From within the city drops you in the outlands. (But not on the spire and not in any way relevant to where the hole is located) Falling through the hole from the outside teleports you to the other side. The problems here however if that getting into this circumstance is almost impossible as no magic of any kind works at the spire. You need non magical flight to get up there and there are forces that don't want you to investigate.  If I get the time later I will dig up all my old material and try and source some of this.

First, the rivers seem to come down from the mountains but mainly just vanish in the middle of nowhere or in small lakes, which is highly improbable.  Then the rivers that go all the way to the ocean are mostly in the north-east of the map, which is an arid biome (deduced from the color, maybe it was not the intention there). Meanwhile, the really green area on the south west of the same range of mountains receive almost no water flow. Weird.  Otherwise, the map is really great!  Edit: corrections on my potato english."

When making the north eastern half I was thinking of the Atacama desert in Chile, how the mountains blocked the rains from reaching the coast resulting in a desert, but I suppose all the rivers in the region would cancel out the desert factor.

imaginarymaps,3dvraf,rekjensen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"My only quibble is that without the US and Britain ascendant in North America, the drive for confederation in Canada would probably be weaker. I would expect a number of Dominions a mari usque ad mare instead: Newfoundland, one or two Maritime Unions, perhaps a Canada (of Ontario and Quebec), and then a Northwest of some sort. All British, but not united as a country."
imaginarymaps,3dvraf,Kaosubaloo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"In real life, one of the prime factors for Newfoundland becoming part of Canada was it nearly going bankrupt from the combined pressures of funding its own railway and a sudden drop in fish prices. If it encountered similar difficulties here, then I see no reason it could not have joined. It's main alternative to joining with an existing NA state would have been to remain a British-controlled colony with little autonomy or self-representation.  That the rest of the provinces would unite is a harder sell. Without American pressure, the Maritimes may not have joined with Ontario and Quebec to form Canada. Ontario and Quebec might have united on their own, but I suspect that such a union would be unstable and Quebec would have likely seceded. That said, if they did manage to stay together, it would almost certainly lead to a very interesting and different Canadian Culture from today's.  As for everything west of (and a large part including) Ontario, that's all Rupert's Land, and as long as the UK didn't want to manage it itself, it makes sense for it to sell it to a British Dominion such as Canada.  On the flip side, it is also worth noting that the Maritimes would have independently had similar financial problems as New Foundland did, and that, in a British controlled NA, Quebec's options at autonomy would have likely been playing along with Ontario or nothing at all."
imaginarymaps,3dvraf,rekjensen,2,Mon Jul 20 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"The first 1948 referendum listed independence as a third option, though it was by far the least popular position. But this timeline wouldn't necessarily put Newfoundland in the same position as in OTL – fish prices fell due to the Great Depression, and debt from WW1 still burdened them. It's possible neither of those would happen in this timeline, if there's a very different WW1 and the US (and Wall Street) are nonexistent in global economics. With NA rife with conflict for an additional 50+ years, it's also possible Britain would invest far more in its holdings in order to keep them.  In this timeline (according to the comments on DA) many of the Quebecois have moved to Louisiana to escape British interference in their culture, resulting in a more homogeneous central Canada, so I could buy a stable Ontario-Quebec union."
imaginarymaps,3dvraf,Kaosubaloo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with the Stable Canada thing.  As for New Foundland, I don't know about a war but the timeline states that this map takes place during a ""The Great Depression"", phrased as such because, taking place in the 1940s, it is obviously not the same event as happened in OTL. In my mind, what would really be the seller for an independant New Foundland (And Maritimes for that matter) would be the level of industrialization they underwent. If they had enough factories put in when the British were funding everything, then it seems reasonable that they would be able to sustain themselves through loses to fish exports without running out of money. That said, I'm not sure why the UK would actually do that; European imperialism was pretty much built upon importing raw materials to Europe to do the processing.  Looking over the timeline again, I think it is pretty much inevitable that Newfoundland will join Canada. That said, it should probably not yet be a part of it. Unless overfishing was way worse in this world than in RL, they would have probably not yet run out of money."
imaginarymaps,3dvraf,rekjensen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:33:15 2015 UTC,"Factories and industrialization make sense in the context of a continental war (or series of subcontinetal wars within a week's march of your border) raging for decades. Shipping resources home only to ship the finished goods back to defend those resources eventually reveals its shortcomings as a long-term plan: the DA post/comments make mention of France and Germany actively involved in North American affairs, which puts those British supply lines at risk."

imaginarymaps,3du63k,microwavedHamster,18,Sun Jul 19 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Canada joins the American Revolution and enters the Union. Quebec is independent but after some land disputes with America they are annexed in the 1790's. The sale of the Louisiana Territory happens in 1803 like in our timeline. But with the recent acquisition of Quebec and the Canadian north the purchase begins to fuel a Manifest Destiny on the next level.  The Spanish Empire is the most powerful overseas empire in the world, replacing the British. Tensions between Spain and America grow because of increasing American settlements in Texas and the mid-west. The first Spanish-American war from 1833-1836 see's America taking Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, the California's, and the rest of the West coast with support from France.   The Second Spanish-American war (also called the Caribbean war) from 1867-1870 is cause by increasing American influence in Central America and the Caribbean. Spanish colonies are slowly turning pro-American which is despised by the Spanish. After decisive naval victories by the Americans  against the combined Spanish-French fleet we see rule of the seas switch from European to American. The Americans take most of Mexico and all French-Spanish islands in the Caribbean. Within 15 years they are all annexed into the Union.   World War I from 1907-1911 sees the biggest shift in power. USA, Germany, Italy, and Austria take on the Colonial powers of Spain, Britain, France, and The United Provinces. The Russian Empire and Byzantine Empire also join but lose embarrassingly in some of the first major battles of the war which lead to Socialist revolutions and the eventual Union of the two Empires.   America dismantles the Spanish Empire, taking Central America and fighting in the South American Wars of Independence. They also take all small-island pacific colonies of the Europeans, some small colonies on the Ivory Coast, and New Zealand. America is the unchallenged ruler of the seas. Americas destiny of ruling the continent is achieved.   The Second American civil war is sparked by racial and ethnic friction (essentially Spanish speaking vs English speaking), and the great depression. Southern Mexico, Central America, and some Caribbean islands leave the Union. The war spans 1920-1924 and is the bloodiest conflict in American History. The Confederates are heavily supplied by the Europeans, adding to the anti-European sentiment already brewing in the USA.  The great depression leads to fascist governments rising in Germany, Italy, Austria, France, and Spain. Dictators take hold of all the European counties, allying with each other and using rising Socialism in the East as a common enemy. When Soviet Russia and Soviet Byzantium form the Soviet Empire it sparks World War 2 from 1949-1955.  This pits the Soviet Empire against Europe and her colonial possessions. The Eastern front is even more brutal than in OTL, with mainly France, Germany, and Austria fighting a land war against the Soviet Empire (See mini-map for size).   American merchant ships heading to the Soviet Empire are sunk on multiple occasions. The American populous blames Europe for the terrible civil war and cries for blood. America starts and island hopping campaign in South-East Asia and invades island possessions of the Europeans. Near the end of the war South Africa and the Ivory coast are also invaded.   This map is in 1975, two decades after the end of the war and at the height of the cold war between the Soviets and the Americans. European countries are now allied with the American in fear of the Soviets. The EU is just starting to take hold and will soon be the single power in Europe.   Africa is the stage of most of the cold war, with proxy wars being fought in most countries by the end of the cold war. South-East Asia also has a few attempted socialist revolutions under the American Empire but they are quickly snuffed out.  Very long I know, sorry :p"

imaginarymaps,3du63k,Carol_White,4,Sun Jul 19 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's been going pretty good so far...but the second civil war was also extremely bloody. With military casualties alone estimated upwards of 2 million because of the modern equipment and angry Europeans. And also having its own share of independence movements, domestic terrorism, socialist guerrillas and social unrest in the Latin States.  As for the Spanish Empire, I probably should have called it the Iberian Empire because the Iberian Union never broke up and the Empire consisted of all Portuguese and Spanish possessions. This leads to a more global Empire and prosperous, more stable colonies in South and Central America."
imaginarymaps,3du63k,phoebus67,3,Sun Jul 19 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"So you have two different points of divergence: ""Canada"" joins the American Revolution, and Spain, for unknown reasons, manages to maintain its power over its empire. I consider this to be a cheat.  By the way, if Spain succeeded in holding off the English, how did England manage to establish colonies in North America in the first place in the 17th century? Because that's when the Spanish Empire went into eclipse--after the defeat of the Armada. The only reason why the English (and the French) were so late in revving up American colonies was Spanish power in the 16th century. This all would have made more sense if you had established a single POD in 1588 (Spanish victory), and granted Spain continued control over the Atlantic and sole access to North America."
imaginarymaps,3du63k,mmtop,3,Sun Jul 19 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point about the Spanish Empire that I never thought of. I failed to mention the 'Spanish Empire' is actually the union of Spain and Portugal, 'Iberia'. I figured the union of the two could create more stability and more prosperous colonies in the Americas.  Iberia would have been the dominant power but not absolute dominance similar to Victorian Britain. They'd be the most powerful but they wouldn't just stomp Britain or France into the ground. Maybe there could have been an 'Atlantic War' where France and Britain take on Iberia for a slice of the pie?   Thanks for the criticism it all helps!"
imaginarymaps,3du63k,DangerDwayne,0,Sun Jul 19 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"There essentially was an Atlantic war--the attemped Spanish conquest of England in 1588. France was in Spain's pocket at the time. I think there was actually an Iberian union at this point, too, but I'm too lazy to look it up. Charles V came close to European hegemony.   I'm just very fuzzy about your chronology, and I still don't know what your POD is. I don't know why you need a stronger Spanish empire in the first place. Remember that in the real world, the Spanish New World empire outlasted the British one anyhow."
imaginarymaps,3du63k,Arekeneras,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest nailing down a single POD is pretty hard since important things happen even before the revolution. A good example is a Byzantine empire that never falls, and ends up being best friend-emies with Russia. This alone would probably change the world so much any other POD wouldn't make sense.  Ignoring that the best POD would probably be Canada joining the union right off the bat. It makes the union feel safer with no northern enemies and let's them focus on the west and south.  As for making Iberia a bigger player, I wanted the Americans to have some real growing pains while taking the north american continent. Running over Mexico, central American and Caribbean states would have been relatively easy but would also paint the Americans as villains in the eyes of the populous. By making Iberia the 'bad guy' it makes the conquests more justified in the eyes of the people."

Some specific nitpicks:   Bermuda is far, far too small a population to be a state, just like the Arctic territories. It would probably become a single county within Carolina or Virginia. Having both a Southern California and a Baja California doesn't make sense since Baja basically means ""lower"". Perhaps you could replace Northern California with a founder's name like Franklin or Jefferson. I don't think a single Hispaniola state could work with the drastically different ethnic, cultural, and linguistic differences on each side of the island. Even if one side conquered the other and then was admitted as a state, the other would eventually want to split off to become their own state like Maine had split off from Massachusetts. I think the borders would make more sense more closely following mountain ranges and rivers, instead of squiggly lines for the sake of it. There's also nothing wrong with straight lines since even the original colonies used them, and there would be similar reasons to keep using them as people pushed west.   I hope I don't come off as too critical, I do still like the map, these are just the things that popped out to me looking it over. Keep working on it!

Adding it as a county is a good idea thanks.  As for Hispaniola I honestly don't know much about the cultures there. But I figured if the Americans got it in time they could 'blur' the lines between the two countries and it wouldn't be too bad.   I redrew a lot of the Midwest borders mainly because I didn't want the map to look 'cookie cutter' in a sense that I just used the same borders as OTL.

imaginarymaps,3du63k,daltonslaw,0,Sun Jul 19 22:08:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it really depends on when the island is taken, but for much of its history the western side that had historically been French black, while the eastern side was Spanish and a mix of white settlers and mestizos. There was a small period(s?) where the island was unified, but it never lasted long.  I don't think you should worry about them being cookie-cutter in the mid-west, as long as you just places lines differently and use different rivers or features to set their boundaries.

However, the new borders would allow Democrats to gain electoral votes from Houston, possibly Trinity (Dallas-Ft. Worth), and maybe Chinati (the 1-2 punch of El Paso + San Antonio).   I'd imagine the effect on the Senate would be even more noticeable, since the current Senate leans more conservative due to the outsized influence of the smaller states.

Looks like Essos."
imaginarymaps,3dkdu4,ColumbianGeneral,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all your feedback. Yeah, I've thought about it and removed the regional labels, at least for the time being.   As for the ""inter-war"" period, I think I should clarify, this is not a collection of countries. It is one country and the ""inter-war"" bit refers to a three year period bookended by two civil wars. That being said, it's  not quite a ""unified"" nation either. Here's where we get a bit into the lore (if you'll allow me, this is something I should flesh out anyway). The way the political map is set up is this (I feel like I should have mentioned this earlier as it is pretty important to the world itself--and in a future iteration I'll have to find a way to make this more clear because this map makes no distinction), there are twelve ""major"" cities and twelve ""minor"" cities. In the past it was this one unified country. Then, some decades ago (about three generations), the major cities (Arbithen, Kelee, Westgate, Teuford, Drisalla, Devil's Claw, Roamburn, Graybridge, Kria, Sila, Brand and Eastgate) became connected via a system of portals. Now this enabled them to form what developed into a network of cities, which made trade and cross-cultural communication much faster than elsewhere in the world, and allowed accelerated development of technology compared to elsewhere. So the major cities became this hybrid of distinct city-states and one Industrial Revolution-level mega city. After this development, the cities became mostly self-sufficient--what use would the rest of the land be to them if cross-country travel was no longer necessary? Or trade with the non-connected cities? The major cities mostly cut themselves off from the rest of the country.   The distinction between ""major"" and ""minor"" cities is because of this--basically the cities that were ""left out of the loop"" (when the portals were constructed, this was due to different socioeconomic and political factors having to do with loyalty to the presiding powers) were left to develop at their own pace. Hence, the ""minor"" cities. These are technologically closer to the 15th-16th century, and trade with each other, though at a slower pace obviously.   I suppose a way of summarizing it is like describing a subway system (again, this is more for my own need to flesh it out for myself than a need for you to hear it). Say you have a big city that reaches out, from dense areas in different parts of it stretching out into suburbs and eventually into more rural parts. Connecting these parts are your standard roads, no subways. This is pre-portal Cairnshiir. Then, a subway system gets built, making travel between parts of the city much faster. But of course, the subway doesn't cover every part of the city, just some of them. Why? What determines subway coverage? In real life, there's a lot of different factors (funding, zoning, logistics, population density) but in this case it can be summed up as politics. This is post-portal Cairnshiir. Then the places where there's subway coverage get developed more, kind of turn into hubs for themselves, and generally become a little more prosperous than the non-covered areas. And the people living near the subway system who use it to get to work and stuff hardly ever need to go where there the subway doesn't go. Those places develop at their own rate, while the subway zone kind of turns into this web.  In a nutshell, these are two worlds, one country. Of course, with the industrial development being mostly limited to the major cities, it was bound to happen that certain things would get out, certain technology would make its way to the countryside. Political ideologies that were for a long time confined to the cities made their way to the rural communities and unsettled cultures, beliefs that had become established independently over the last several decades. Not only that, proof that certain technology had been deliberately kept from the hands of the minor cities and villages--technology that arguably could have saved thousands of lives in times of famine, drought, or disaster--made its way out to the masses. Talks of rebellion and calls for change to the portal system sprang up, resulting in a period of intense civil war between some of the major and minor cities, particularly in the southeast. Needless to say, the minor cities that banded together were defeated handily and several of them were razed and destroyed (hence the ruins in the peninsular region and on the Southern Island) before a ceasefire was called. Their political turmoil, however, spilled over into the major cities and spread pretty quickly, and a couple of movements sprang up, some calling for destruction of the portals, others calling for expansion to the minor cities, others for a turn to isolationism--and in some areas, calls for total independence, essentially turning them into city-states.   So the inter-war period is very tense. Needless to say, there's definitely another civil war on the horizon.  Tl;dr: me fleshing things out here rather than in my outline"

Export out a shape or area that interests me as in BMP format as large as my PC and Fractal Terrains would tolerate and perform (for me, over 10000px wide) Open the BMP into Photoshop, convert to a layer, save as a PSD. Begin tweaking shape until I like the base form and layout of the coastline Start drawing elevation, step by step, layer by layer, adding islands and lakes/water areas as I go along. I made each elevation level is a different layer (you wouldn't necessarily have to do this, it just keeps things well divided for me) Massive amounts of tweaking ad naseum. Gets a bit tedious, to be honest, but it's the most comfortable for me. Start adding rivers based on the elevation I've drawn. Tweak land forms as desired/needed. Start developing administrative divisions (started with largest one and worked my way down: In Shaelia's case it was Holding >> District >> Municipality)  Outline all of these administrative divisions in both black and white color, so that you can later develop a whole bunch of stat maps regarding your country quickly and easily. (Working on all those as I speak) - TV markets, wrestling territories, metro areas, Cable TV maps, etc.... literally anything you can quantify. Create a massive (8+ MB and counting) spreadsheet holding all the information you can think of about every aspect of a country you can think of about said country inhabiting said map. More than 4,000 (and counting) settlements currently listed in spreadsheet. Start adding those cities/towns to the map, thinking hard about where people would naturally live given the land/elevation/lakes/etc you've drawn, and how they would naturally develop/spread out/etc. Repeat until you get all the major cities in (for me, that was any place with a population over 100,000 (almost 100 of them). Start adding transportation information (highways, major roads mostly). Rails coming later. Airports are also added. Continue tweaking everything as it continues to develop. Goal is to make it as detailed yet legible as possible"

imaginarymaps,3degu5,Jaraxo,15,Wed Jul 15 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"thats a really neat map, but i think there might be too many airports"
imaginarymaps,3degu5,JayDutch,19,Wed Jul 15 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   Concerning the airports: are you meaning the international ones, or the overall number?   The white icons are airports that aren't setup to handle international disembarkations/embarkations. Over the past 40-50 years, air travel has become a more important aspect of Shaelic society, and a wave of airport construction began in the 1960s through the 70s. It's also kind of a cultural thing... the Shaels call it ""Wíska Tabienara"" (The Tradition of Public Works). In pre-Republican Shaelia there was a long-standing tradition among Shaelic kings and queens to establish some manner of public work to benefit society as a whole and as a lasting legacy during to their reign. Common examples include universities, schools, water or sewer systems, roadways, other transportation services, granaries, theatres, or public parks.  That being said, I have wondered myself about the number of international airports I have listed. I look forward to your thoughts (should you care to respond) :)"

imaginarymaps,3degu5,kalasoittaja,2,Thu Jul 16 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"I think lots of airports is possible, but the number on the east coast of the island might actually be excessive. Like, really excessive.  In my region, there's 3 internationals, one federal airfield that I know of, an AFB up way north of here, at least one Executive airport and about 3 general aviation airports. We could probably support another international, but the northern part is semi-rural, some bigger cities but not many and lots of land, mostly farmland.  The three internationals are all concentrated around a large body of water where most of the region's population is centered, and we probably couldn't handle more than a couple more in this part of the region because of air traffic. Too much would be a safety hazard.  The FAA classifies airports by a few different types, but if the blue ones are internationals, there's far too many of those concentrated around each other, and the island, while fairly large, isn't large enough to easily justify that many even with a good backstory because the economics just wouldn't support it.  So maybe recolor some of them based at least loosely off of the FAA's types, and figure out what they are used for.  Internationals primarily serve passengers, but usually only have 1 terminal dedicated to it. My local airport has 3 domestic terminals and 1 quite large international terminal for example.  General aviation 'ports often support passengers but more often than not serve other purposes as well. An executive airport is for private jet owners. Some airports only deal with cargo, and even if it's shipped internationally it isn't necessarily an international airport.  And don't forget helipads! Those would fit your backstory pretty well too, vertical takeoff doesn't require as much land and air traffic is less of a problem. I could easily see the people of your country preferring that over say, taking the ferry to Seattle or something. Or driving 100-150 miles to the next city.  All of that said, I really love this map and is easily one of my favorites from this subreddit so far. I'm new to this subreddit, but I just haven't seen a lot of maps that outright add large landmasses to the world and would like to see more! :)  Thank you for sharing this map with us!"

I probably did get a little carried away, mostly because I had a bit of a USA mentality about it. All ""big cities"" have 1 or 2 big airports. I applied that probably a little too liberally to Shaelia. LOL  I haven't done my due diligence with research on this, I will admit. Thanks for the suggestions. I'll definitely be checking that out :-)  Helipads are an awesome idea! I hadn't give that much thought.... man, you've really got my mind churning now LOL Great idea, thanks!!!!!

I don't know what latitude this island lays at but the minimap looks awfully similar to the Pacific North West of the USA so I'd expect bears on those islands and lots of snow, perhaps ski resorts up in the mountains?  What development stage is your society at?  I'd guess with lots of 1m+ cities it's a fairly developed society so ski slopes exist? :D"
imaginarymaps,3degu5,Uberaloaf123,6,Thu Jul 16 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, Shaelia is located off the west coast of the USA and Canada. :)  We definitely have some bears... and some pretty big ones. Mountain Lions, too. Bears are still revered symbols of strength, courage, and tenacity in the northern Holdings of Batza, Cesae, and Kaelanei, where up until the early 18th century, the predominant religion was Féðonaenu, literally ""The Worship of the Bear"". It was believed that the spirits of one's ancestors were watched over and protected by bears, and seeing one was always good luck.  Definitely ski resorts as well. The last Official Census report (2011) reported 106 ski resorts in the country, or approximately one for every 868,611 persons. Best skiing is in the central and northern spine of the island. Shaelia has some very good skiing, and I would imagine we'd do okay in the Winter Olympic events.  Shaelia is an industrialized, diversified, fully developed first world economy. Per capita GDP is $41,556 as of June 2015, with an economic output of $4.5+ trillion. Their centuries-old feudal system was replaced with a republican system modeled heavily after the US Constitution in 1811, after a series of increasingly destructive dynastic wars that began in the 1760s. Outside of the language and ardent refusal to adopt American culture and customs, Shaelia is just as advanced and evolved as Western Europe.  Thanks for the questions!"

A nice coastal resort with plenty of local amenities, not too big though. Warm in the summer but also not too far from ski resorts for the winter, assuming there are resorts in the south central region north of Buyyo, even if they're not as good as the ones further noroth?. Though employment wise you're probably want to going to move west to either Siana or Artya, especially for work in what I presume is the port for trading routes to other major coast cities."
imaginarymaps,3degu5,RileyRichard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"The best beach resports are in Vesica, which is at the far south of the island. Bimi and Lanthara are both very popular resort areas.   Humråbáså is a wonderful place to live. :-) Very good climate, historic Cendlese cultural ties (the name itself is Cendlese, a sister language to Shaelic). Very laid back lifestyle. It's on the far western edge of the Dastraglau (the large bay between the ""main"" part of the island and the peninsula where Dunth is located in Vesica.  Yep, you're right. Siana and Artytá are the major economic hubs of the holding of Cenedlyser. Siana is the 3rd largest city in the country; Artytá is 6th.  The skiing in the northern Cenedlyser/southern Vaster/Western Zopraeje area above Buyyø is pretty good. The problem is most of that area is considered sacred to Jascora (the predominate faith on Shaelia before the arrival of Christianity with the Spanish. It still comprises about 10% of the population today. That large mountain range there above Buyyø is named Glaehandea and the highest peak, Dora Kírvarma, is known as The Place Where The Guardians Speak. So not a lot of that commercial development has been done in that area. It's a more rural area of the country by design and decree of the Provotau, the ecclesiastical governing council for Jascora and the ultimate authority for the faith on Earth."

It's an outcome more favorable for Germany than in our history, however; German territorial integrity looks intact. Further:   There is no Polish Corridor, for example; Poland is carved out of Russia without German territory. There is no Austria. Germany looks like it obtained Austria, plus the Sudetenland and South Tyrol. France looks to have regained part of Alsace-Lorraine.   Perhaps what happened is that without US entry the war remains a stalemate. When the two exhausted sides finally agree to Woodrow Wilson's offer to serve as mediator, he makes sure that self-determination is an important part of the treaty. The war has destabilized Austro-Hungary enough that it dissolves, but Germany avoids losing any territory and, in fact, gains some from self-determination.  The postwar UK was significantly destabilized by victory; a UK that did not lose but did not win, either, might not be stable enough to focus sufficiently on Ireland to retain Ulster. Perhaps Mussolini stayed with his early left-wing views and established the Italian People's Republic. A France that did not win perhaps shouldn't be orange but rather red, dark green, or brown."

imaginarymaps,3d5l99,lord_allonymous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:20 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty good. Gonna add this to an already long list of books I'm going to buy.
imaginarymaps,3d5l99,Bwhitty23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"The book follows characters in an alternate United States circa 1962, where the nation has been carved up following a longer World War II where the Allies lost- FDR was shot and killed early in his 1st term, leading to the complete destruction of the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbour and eventually an invasion of America by the Japanese. Meanwhile in the east, the Nazis defeat Britain with an annihilation of the RAF and a conquest of London, leading to dominance across Europe and, later, America.  (The series also has a nuclear attack on the USA, but I'm not sure if that's in the book)  The west coast is Japanese controlled, governed by the Home Islands and embracing of Japanese culture, and the east has been annexed as part of the Greater Nazi Reich with similar anti-Semitic laws in place. Since Japan and Germany have significant tensions, a buffer zone exists between them in the Rockies to prevent conflict.  Hitler, at this point, is crippled by Syphilis picked up in his days on the streets of Vienna, leaving other high-ranking Nazis in a squabble for leadership. Germany is the world's only superpower at this point, developing jet engine technology much earlier than in reality as well as establishing colonies on the moon and Mars. A campaign of extermination has also been launched in Africa, destroying native communities on an advance across the continent.  At the same time, a book is circulating on the black market- The Grasshopper lies Heavy, written by a mysterious author living in the buffer zone. In the book, an alternate history is proposed where the Allies won World War II and carved up Europe in a similar fashion to how America has been. The book is banned by the Nazis (and the Japanese, I think), but most of the characters in the book have read it. Also important in many of the characters' lives is the I Ching, which most of the characters use in decision-making throughout the novel.  I won't go into any more detail, since I might spoil the book, but I hope that clears the plot up for you :)"

I'm reading it at the moment for a comparative essay on dystopian societies, and I absolutely love it. The switch between characters is quite complicated to begin with, but as you learn more about them it gets much clearer."
imaginarymaps,3d5l99,lappy482,9,Tue Jul 14 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"I definitely have to give this a try. I'm a total sucker for alternate history stories, but I feel Nazi victories are usually done badly. In those cases the Nazis are always portrayed extremely one-dimensional, doing evil just for evil's sake. This is just bad and lazy work. I hope this show does a better job."
imaginarymaps,3d5l99,DrPantaleon,9,Mon Jul 13 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"The pilot episode was kind of unrealistic in that regard. One nazified American police officer was standing there eating a sandwich, when white ash came falling out of the sky. Other character is like ""What's that?"" and the officer is like ""Oh, they're just burning the jews and cripples."""
imaginarymaps,3d5l99,rainmaninjapan,11,Tue Jul 14 00:28:07 2015 UTC,I think you underestimate the power of nazi propaganda.
imaginarymaps,3d5l99,Icerex,8,Tue Jul 14 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"That scene was terrificly not one-sided, and pretty realistic, in my opinion.  The police officer was being really friendly and helpful what with fixing the dude's car, offering him a piece of his lunch and just being a friendly dude in general.  And then you get the terrible contrast in that he quite nonchalantly says ""Oh, it's the hospital. Tuesdays, they burn cripples, the terminally ill — drag on the state."".  It's an accurate portrayal in that propaganda and ideology can carry a completely displaced level of morality. For a lot of people, it doesn't - but then again, for a lot of people it actually does."

imaginarymaps,3cvalu,AmeriCossack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"I've got a long write  up, but it's quite a wall of text.  The Baronlands  http://imgur.com/jKwqLwZ  The Baronlands are a geographic area of Albion, and Crown Shire. The usual definition is given as everything between Damneck and Lake Quabbin in the east and the Greatwater and Uskhills in the west. To the North is Bogswine and the Ironsford, and to the south lay the Sea of Royaume. The Baronlands are, as a consequence of their unique governance, in possesion of two capitals as opposed to two. First is Canton, an ancient Fronchean construction that his since fallen into grave disrepair. It serves as the seat of the Lord-Sheriff. However, the Lord-Sheriff also holds the title of Lord-Baron, and so spends most of his time in the much more important Baronsport.   The Baronlands are host to two primary industries. First of all, agriculture. Even before the Earthshaking, the Baronlands held some of the warmest country in Albion south of the Seven Bonfires. Snow melt from the Ironsford Mountains as well as decaying plant matter swept south by rivers and streams from Bogswine meant that the land was bountiful. The other main industry was trade- vital supplies of tin and flint comes out of Berossium and Flintham Reevedom, iron and gold from Ironsford, which would then have to be taken over land through the Baronalands to be taken to the Gulf of Arkham, then shipped to the rest of the isle, or south to Royaume.   In the days prior to the Fronchean occupation of the isle, various kingdoms and fiefs were dotted across the landscape, and this was no where more true then the Baronlands, which then had a different name- Belukur. The Fairfolk, Dunmarii, Morimarii, Jentilak, Bonemen, and Woodwoses were slowly being pushed further and further north, as the Uskmen continued their brutal colonization of the isle. By the time the Froncheans had arrived, most groups aside from the Uskmen had been driven either into hiding or to extinction south of the Miskatonik Mountains. The Jentilak cleared the land of the great primeval forests. Large scale agriculture began in Belukur and across the islands, and navigation began over the Ley Lines from Berossium and Ironsford.   The Froncheans arrived, and with the help of the Albionese of the Miskatonik Valley and the Isle of Stann, killed, enslaved or subdued most of the Uskmen. For the new Albionese majority, life was grand. Shipping and agriculture were protected by Fronchean Legions, and trade with the mainland of Royaume had never been better.   However, when Fronchea fell, it's successor state in Albion, Lutece, was undermanned and overextended. Swampfolk, Uskmen, and various other savages descended on all of the Albionese regions of Albion, but the Baronlands especially. Even a proto-Voktish people attacked, seizing Flintham. All of Belukur was nominally part of Lutece, administered from the Lutetian enclave of Canton on the River Flavios.  The order in the Baronlands was the following: The fertile lands across the shire were ravaged by Uskmen, Ironsmen, Swampfolk, Lakemen and the Vokts. The cities of Dunham and Byron on the coast of the Dunmarii Sea were sacked several times. Farmland was sacked, and the normal land routes out of Ironsford and Berossium were supplanted by sea routes. Crops withered. The corrupt Albionese Don of Damneck subjugated Flavios and several Lutetian territories on the isle of Stann with the Lutetians to busy trying to fight off the Albionese to notice. For several centuries it would become a veritable wasteland as fields were overgrown and ruins festered. Criminal and barbarian intrigue dotted the whole of Belukur.   However, one man from the town of Byron, a friend to the King of Albion in their youth, set about through an alliance with the Swampfolk. His name was Aethlugus, and he was the head of the Byronian division of the Caravaneer's Guild of Belukur. For years the industry of that and many other guilds had been suffering, either collapsing or barely scraping along, with the exception of a few guilds.   Through nationalist Albionese rhetoric and good buisness sense, he slowly built an alliance and network of guilds and minor lords in the lands south of Bogswine. When the corrupt capos of Damneck attempted to put a stop to it, the people of Byron rose up in rebellion. The Consortium of Barons was declared in that territory, as capos, Vokts, Swampfolk, Uskmen and assorted ruffians and barbarians were overthrown in the surrounding territories. The League of Craftsmen and Merchants that was the Consortium swept through the chaotic and fractured lands. Berossium was subjugated, the Vokts were quite nearly exterminated in Flintham, and the Dons of Damneck were put to the chopping block. After backstabbing the Swampmen Kingdom of Crawford and expelling the Swampfolk, he built a massive series of fortifications known as ""The Thousandforts""   Aethlugus declared himself Baron of Caravaneers, and Lord-Baron of the Land. He restructured the Guilds and businesses of the land, rewarding those that helped him with the assets of those that did not. Every single member of the Carpenters Guild in Belekur was enslaved, and to this day in the Baronlands the only way to get a carpenter is to deal with the Slaver's Guild.  The Guilds and Bankers were compelled to elect a ""Baron"" to represent them. These Barons would then come to the House of Barons in the city formerly known as Flinton, now renamed Baronsport. Here they would vote in a very parliamentarian manner, with the Lord-Baron holding veto power.  While officially the position of each Baron is not inheritable, more often then not it is elected in a patrilinear manner, though there have been shakeups. The line of Aethelugus no longer controls the Barony- rather, it is controlled by their cousins, the Starlings, after Baron Xavion Lugus IV proved impotent and mad, apparently throwing himself into the Miskatonik without leaving an heir.   After Aethelugus's conquest of the land, and arrangement of the Barony into the Consortium Government, immediately swore fealty to King Howerd I House Lovecraft, King of the Miskatonik Valley and Tinham. Together, they would begin in earnest the conquest of the Martyr's Moors, Bogswine, Brigante, and Fordshire. Thus rose the Kingdom of Albion as we know it today. Though Aethelugus was given countless titles, today, the Baron is given two primary titles- Lord-Baron of the Consortium and Lord-Sheriff of the Baronlands. It is also common for Barons upon reaching an old age to retire to become the Master of Guilds for the whole Kingdom.  Despite it's illustrious beginnings, the power of the Baron has been eroded over time by divisions in the land by the many small polities and guilds. However, the Starlings of Rockford Hill are trying to change that...  Major cities include:   Baronsport  Byron  Dunham  Rockford Hill  Whitechest  Canton  Stonecog  Blaine  Hasegrinn"

Basically, Japan promised to free Asia from Western Colonialism under the creation of a UN-Like Union of several states, with Japan being their leader, many other sources and most of Japanese propaganda and statism stayed that this was a bunch of bullshit, and Japan would actually dominate all of Asia.  The proposed states would be (with a current version of them) -  Nipponic Empire - Japan  Empire of the Manchus - Manchuria (China)  State of Mongolia - Mongolia/Inner Mongolia (China)  Kingdom of Bod - Tibet (China)  Kingdom of Nepal - Nepal  Ba Maw Empire - Burma  Khmer - Cambodia  Hindustan - British Raj  Kingdom of Afghanistan - Afghanistan/Balochistan  Autonomous State of Drukyul - Bhutan  Uyghurstan - Xinjiang (China)  Prathet Thai - Thailand  Malaya Desam - Malay Peninsula  Kingdom of Jawa - Indonesia  Kingdom of Annan - Vietnam  As you can see, the absurd European part is not colored, and it's not finished, but it's a sneak peek of what it might look like later."

Maybe the best-case scenario would be that a lack of an external military threat would lead to a better restructuring of the Soviet government and a reduction of aggressive foreign policy. Then they could achieve FULL COMMUNISM!  I couldn't see a big war happening, because even when America ""won"" the Cold War, Russia kept its nuclear weapons and nobody tried to invade it. Probably you would just see increasing levels of influence around the world. Governments might begin to swing left, which would be celebrated by the global media as ""opening up to reform"" or similar... I think the best way to play the Soviet victory scenario would be to take our (not particularly exciting) world over the last 25 years and invert it. Which countries would be like Cuba and North Korea, still holding out against the prevailing ideology? Where would China stand? What exactly happens to the defeated United States - does it become democratically socialist? Does it shake things up? Instead of Russia annexing Crimea, does our bitter and defeated America bring the tanks into New Brunswick and Nova Scotia? What happens to the Middle East? Does Texas try to declare independence like Chechnya did?  I think, if you held yourself back from writing yourself a big conventional war, a peaceful world under a slightly more tolerant Soviet hegemony with a diminished but still standing United States could be very interesting."

If a Communist USSR survived in the same form as the cold war it would likely hold the same borders perhaps even expanding southward to some extent such as Afghanistan than the USSR 1990. In this alternate reality communism must have somehow been more successful at dominating global socioeconomics going back to the beginning of the cold war (which it did not - even subtracting U.S. interventionism from the calculation). Perhaps some of the states that the USSR supported in Asia, Central and South America, even Africa would be communist today beyond North Korea, Laos, and Cuba. You can assume that much of the Eastern Bloc countries would still be Communist to an extent. In this reality a literal domino effect would have occurred so many countries would be more Communist leaning. Communism also tends to lead to stronger national ties over religious or ethnic ties so many of the countries that exist today would never have dissolved from their original designation like Yugoslavia.  I would assume that some countries - US, UK, Japan Etc . . .would remain strongly Capitalist and not have revolted into communism but in this alternative universe that might be looked down upon as a 'second world' type system without the ability to enforce its global imperialist agenda. Now large scale nuclear war still would not have occurred as mutually assured destruction would still exist but we can hope that clearer heads prevailed and disarmament treaties still went through and organizations like the U.N. still function.  Its odd to think about.   Get out their and make a map."
imaginarymaps,3cm4yj,Clovis69,9,Thu Jul 9 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  NATO ""won"" the Cold War.  Germany united as a state with a democratically elected government and the process chosen was one of the options implemented in the West German constitution of 1949 to facilitate eventual reunification. The East German Nationale Volksarmee was absorbed into the West German Bundeswehr to form the German Bundeswehr.  ""The Nationale Volksarmee was disbanded in 1990. Its facilities and equipment were handed over to the Bundeswehr. Most facilities were closed, and equipment was either sold or given to other countries. Most of the NVA's 36,000 officers and NCOs were let go, including all officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel. Only 3,200 were retained by the Bundeswehr after a demotion of one rank."" - that isn't what happens when no one wins.

Probably all of Germany unified under USSR influence. Domino theory proven true in SE Asia and the Pacific. Most of the Commonwealth severing ties with the mother country. SouthAmerica going very Red. Middle East definitely under USSR control.   If the Cold War went 'hot'.. New Zealand the only country left standing.
imaginarymaps,3cm4yj,legitprivilege,2,Thu Jul 9 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"The Soviet Union was more overextended than the United States - no venegeful foreign power went and decided to reassign its borders in 1991, the Soviet republics gained independence by themselves, through referendum. In this scenario you would probably want America to break up from within, and I doubt that it would collapse into many equally-sized blocs - especially because, while the Soviet republics each had their own language and culture and felt threatened by Russia (which massively outsized any other republic), Americans speak the same language and no one state is obviously dominant in the way that Russia was. The Soviet Union is easy to break up, but if you forget about petty state rivalries (which are, in fact, petty), the United States was named that way for a reason."
imaginarymaps,3cm4yj,sacredsnowhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"I half-heartedly disagree, in that you might be conveniently forgetting the civil war which divided the U.S. a century before the height of the Cold War. If the Federal Government were to collapse, is it really that implausible that the USA would divide?"

imaginarymaps,3cm4yj,sacredsnowhawk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough on that point. I guess in my mind the only way in which the USSR could win the Cold War would involve a PoD very early on. Maybe early reunification of Germany, some horrifically weak Presidency, disaster in Korea and civil rights protests turn violent.. I guess the only path to victory for the USSR is a USA that fractures apart in the 50s/60s."

The same in the Axis Plans map i am currently doing, there is a ongoing Cold War between the Three Axis and some others, Japan is under a political Cold War with Japan in National Socialism vs. Shintoism, and Germany is against Italy in controlling the Middle East for oil.  I am not sure but Finland would have been a place for the last remaning Jews to escape, since in my map the UK never declared war on Germany, the Madagascar Plan was realized, creating the Zionzustand Madagaskar and turning Madagascar into the biggest concentration camp in existance, i am not sure if Hitler would've still exterminated the Jews en-masse or let them starving to death on the Island."

The idea came from thinking: what if the population exploded from the current 15,000 to over 1,000,000? Based on current routes and travel patterns, I reasoned that the metro (SNCF's network of regional rail lines in their department) lines would be built starting from 1 and moving up.

And what would Saskatchewan and Dakota's motivations be- it seems like that whole north-central US/south-central Canada region have no real reason economically or socially to be so divided.  Hell, I live in Michigan, and it seems like part of the Rustbelt Republic and the Republic of Huron would actually be more likely to band together as one if only for control of the world's largest reserve of fresh water. Why split the waterways between two regions who have every reason to cooperate?"
imaginarymaps,3bbj29,legitprivilege,2,Sun Jun 28 00:23:37 2015 UTC,"The bitchy rivalry between Edmonton and Calgary, the only rivalry between two nearly-equal big cities in Canada (which is, of course, behind all attempts to cut Alberta in half), strikes me as just the same as any bitchy rivalry between American states. Underneath it all we know that we're the same people, but since when has that ever stopped anyone? Here's my shortlist of minor differences combined with the kind of indignation that should be familiar to anyone who's ever said or read ""but [state] will never join [region] because we hate [other state]!"":   Slightly different demography: the colonizing authorities gave away free land, but only to white people. The real desirables (Brits, Germans before 1914) got the warmer ranching country in the south. The Eastern Europeans (and there's a lot of them) got what was left, in the middle. The arid country south of Calgary got ex-American settlers, who were the only ones who knew how to do the irrigation. So there are still some differences between the farming folk. The ones in the south form Canada's real American-style conservative heartland - the ones in the north are a bit more volatile and the Ukrainians brought a whole bunch of Communist periodicals with them. But, nobody farms these days anyway, so we have to keep searching. Oil: Oil and gas were first discovered in the south, but not in huge amounts. The real gushers were hit in Leduc, just south of Edmonton, and of course the oilsands are about as north as you can get before leaving the province. And yet the oil companies still prefer to set up shop in Calgary!! So, the workers end up in Edmonton, and the middle managers end up in Calgary. Now I have my doubts on whether Edmontonians really want a bunch of uppity HQs right next to the provincial Legislature, but it's the money that matters, and Calgary seems to get more of it. Attitude: Calgary has swagger and people want to visit it. There it is, right in the Rockies - what a nice skyline, rolling prairies, foothills, mountains, it's all there. They have the famous mayor, they have the money, they have the stampede, they have the largest-city status. Edmonton has the legislature and a mall, and when you dig further, there's the River Valley, North America's largest system of contiguous parks. A huge park in a land world-renowned for total environmental devastation? Calgary naturally fits into the role of Alberta's only city - besides, it's where the government was headquartered for about 70 years. Edmonton just sticks out. Political incompatibility: This might ring home for anyone who used to say that the second American Civil War would be over something like gay marriage. I have my doubts on that one, but I'll run through this topic anyway. The province has changed its government all of four times in 110 years; no party has ever been re-elected. This is the last few decades: Edmonton is the mixed-up city which gets taken by the Liberals (self-descriptive), or the NDP (more lefty than the Liberals), or the center-conservative party, or, more likely, all three. Calgary votes conservative and it usually pays off. The last two governments, Social Credit and Progressive Conservative, were easy - they were based in Calgary and Calgary voted for them every time. Their job was to not touch anything and watch as the oil money kept flowing, and that usually worked - but just a couple months ago the PCs lost to the NDP, which is a pretty big deal for Canada. Alberta is the one special province where government doesn't work like it does in the rest of Canada, the only province that brings in a huge conservative majority (not an easy feat when more than two parties exist) every time. This time, Edmonton is unanimously NDP, and Calgary is split five ways - the PCs, Wildrose (conservative party II), and NDP are nearly tied, and the Liberals and Alberta Party (upstart moderate party) have both found one seat each (their only seats) in Calgary. The two cities aren't totally opposed to each other, but they're never in agreement.   Of course, this all extends to the rest of the province because the majority of Albertans live in either Edmonton or Calgary. There are only two hangups when you divide Alberta north-to-south: where to actually put the line (north of the halfway point, probably), and what to do with the Rocky Mountains (the people in Canmore and the national parks are huge hippies - must be all the fresh air). Everything else is about as justified as any other reshuffling of internal boundaries within a country with no specific ethnic makeup that speaks mostly the same language.  Oh, and if the North includes both Edmonton and Calgary - I take it all back, the South would just be a way to unite the most American (and Mormon) bit of Canada with its opposite number across the 49th."

I know Missoula, MT, where I'm from would be at the very edge of the bioregion, given those borders, and as a city I know that it would most likely be more than happy to fit right in with 'Cascadia.'

imaginarymaps,3b7y56,rekjensen,5,Fri Jun 26 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Once I figure out where mountains would form, I want to trace rivers down to lakes in low lying areas.

As much as possible, I want to let the geography be defined by the algorithm - then, base the socio-political story on that landscape. I kind of like this formation because each continent has thousands of miles of tropical beaches.  I imagine a large resort economy with tourists coming by the thousands to lie on the beaches in the light of the moons.  There are some land masses that would be island nations who would have sailed the world in great fleets, trading and colonizing.  There are fertile plains that would be great for agriculture and great wastes where life would be challenging and people would have to be tough to survive."

imaginarymaps,3b7y56,CNiper,6,Fri Jun 26 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"Tropical storms curve away from the equator eventually because of prevailing winds, to the northwest north of the equator and southwest south of the equator, so they wouldn't continue indefinitely. Tsunamis are only destructive when they come ashore, because the ground rises up and forces the water up; mid-ocean, tsunamis are measured in centimetres to metres.  But if the moon(s) orbits at the equator, there would be a permanent tidal wave circling the planet."

imaginarymaps,3az4wn,Arixophon,5,Wed Jun 24 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay, wasn't home to post it all. But here goes with some of what I have at the higher level:  The Kingdom of Arges in the map posted here is one of the eight major kingdoms which control a large island landmass.   GENERAL INFO  The inhabitants of the continent, which has no official name, are human. There is no magic, outside of the supposed miracles performed by Tol, the god.   There mythical beasts such as ""The Beast of Bolais"" and others that are talked about in peasant's stories, but their existence cannot be proven. Still, you won't find many villagers with their windows and doors open in the night.   The primary religion worships the all-god, Tol. The kingdoms of Petrosk and Braestrond maintain a pantheon of other demi-gods which rule specific facets of life and nature, under Tol. This often leads to holy wars declared on these kingdoms by the Allfather in Morgenstern, though they are usually not taken seriously by the busy kingdoms who are usually already at war with one another for more material reasons.  KINGDOMS  The Kingdom of Arges and Orinond were at one time united and known as the Kingdom of Aues. They were ruled by an elected monarch, chosen by a council of the most powerful noblemen. The elected monarch would rule for life, but maintained only his own estates and wherever that was then became the capital for the time. In the year 1139, the kingdoms of Morgenstern and Provengio invaded from the east, after defeating the invaders at the Battle of Senque, the marshall of the army named Edmond Orinond attempted a coup to seize the throne from the reigning monarch, King Reynard I. The coup became a civil war, which ended in 1143 with the Treaty of Bolais, which split the Kingdom of Aues into their respective pieces. Both of the new Kingdoms became hereditary monarchies at that point in time. Emnity between the two factions continues as the descendents of both Reynard and Edmond claim the other kingdom.  Braestrond, is the kingdom to the north, it's a beautiful, mountainous, but harsh land, with a history of raiding and of being the prime traders of the northern seas. They were at one time many small clans and tribes but repeated attempts to conquer their land galvanized them into a strong kingdom. For the most part, they remain indifferent to the affairs to the south, only entering into conflict to protect their control on shipping and trade in the north.  Berovia and Provengio are two wealthy kingdoms in the south of the continent. They are some of the oldest kingdoms in the land, and most advanced technologically. They control trade in the southern seas, and are often at odds and warring with each other over the trade routes.  Kestruvic is a wild mountainous region, covered in dense forests. It is those same mountains and forests that have allowed Kestruvic to remain independent for so long. Their land is rich in timber, precious metals, and game and so are often attacked by their neighbors to the west and north.   Petrosk is a cold and grassy steppe. While it has a central leader, it's nobles are more independent than the leader would like. Petrosk is a land lacking in any real value though, and so they will often ally themselves with their more powerful neighbors in an attempt to gain land from Kestruvic to the south. Petrosk is known for having the best horses in the land, and many wealthy knights from other kingdoms ride a Petroski Destrier.   Morgenstern is one of the most powerful kingdoms. It's place at the center of the land allows it to generate great wealth in the form of taxes and passage on overland trade routes. The River Stern, which flows from the middle of the kingdom south to the sea is their only connection to sea trade, and many nobles fight to gain a castle along the river so as to charge fees from passing merchant ships. Morgenstern is also the seat of the Allfather, the highest priest of Tol. Tol is the primary diety in the land, and all kingdoms follow the faith, with some differences. Morgenstern often uses it's power over the Church of Tol to it's advantage.    Album of some landscapes I made to illustrate.  Always welcome feedback. It's all very much a world in progress."

There is no fire bolts or frost nova spells or Harry potter like spells. But there lots of mythical beasts, enchanted swords and armors, undead fiends and ghouls that can be summoned by necromancers, and so on. But all the combat is physical with swords and arrows.

imaginarymaps,3azims,glashgkullthethird,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:27:31 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, so a few days ago I posted on /r/worldbuilding this map: http://i.imgur.com/D2WSkTO.jpg  I was unhappy with the way it turned out in terms of land formations (as someone pointed out it looked too Mediterranean), so I pretty much redrew it (so it now looks like I copied Middle Earth or the Wheel of Time world but reversed it).  This is a hand-drawn map of a revised world.  Is it at all geographically feasible?  The poorly-drawn mountains, so far, indicate the highest points in their respective ranges.  The blank empty space in the top-left is tundra that I haven’t figured out what to put in and the space on the right of Mazya hasn’t quite been thought out yet (I was thinking maybe putting in a few rivers and a rainforest?).  I also want to put in a few more islands – where would they naturally form on the world?  Thanks a lot!"
imaginarymaps,3azims,boringdude00,3,Wed Jun 24 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"The mountains are odd, though not necessarily incorrect if you're envisioning the whole are between them being mountainous as well. You seem to have tried to put a mountain range at the end of every watershed, giving your mountains a chaotic look, but watersheds often end at hills or even on the flat plains. You can easily get away with eliminating a few to clean things up.   Mountains tend to occur in long chains, due to how they're formed, so I'd recommend trying to align the rest in a series of top-to-bottom (or left-to-right lines, rather than having them run jagged every which way."

New England is now an independent entity, having gained it in the early 1880s. The Maritime Provinces of Canada merged with New England in the late 1890s after Quebec split from Canada. Adirondack became part of New England due to the change in Columbia's [The United States] Constitution, which abolished states and reorganised them into districts. Adirondack, along with the rest of New England, seceded to preserve their autonomy."

imaginarymaps,3awxtb,donwhitman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"The reason Newfoundland joined Canada in real life was because it nearly went bankrupt and the only real alternative was heavy GB oversight with little real autonomy.   If fish prices still crash, then Newfoundland will probably still face the same financial problems, although how they deal with those could be quite different with the change in the political landscape. They would most likely still be rescued by Great Britain, but whether they later decided to stay with GB or join New England could easily change. However, without a huge amount of industry development (financed by another nation) over a relatively short time period, they would not be able to be economically successful as an independent nation."

Original post from some months ago, there i also explain what basically it is and the sources of the documents are linked, remember that The Americas are not featured because absolutely nothing was told about its fate, the maximum we know was Japanese presence in Alaska and Hawaii.  Something that really caught my attention reading again those texts is that Finland would not have the Kola peninsula like it always does in Axis Victory maps, Kola would serve as a Exclave of the Reich, i think they wanted it for its powerful Fishing and northern exploration industry.  What really wondered me is if Germany would've given the Sami-majority areas from Finnmark, i really think they wanted to keep the Arctic passage for them.

imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,fernguts,7,Mon Jun 22 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"I love this!  It's scary as hell, but interesting food for thought.  To be picky though, wasn't Hitler willing to allow Britain to keep its overseas colonies (at least the ones in Africa that Japan & Italy weren't really interested in), so long as they were willing to make peace with the Axis?  From what I recall, part of the reason why he turned his back on Britain and launched Operation Barbarossa instead of Operation Sea Lion was because he was convinced that the Brits would eventually ""come to their senses"" and accept his terms."
imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,SithLordDarthRevan,2,Tue Jun 23 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"Well, he couldn't secure air superiority.

imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,fernguts,3,Tue Jun 23 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"The Nazis and Soviets were at peace in 1940, and at least on paper they were closer to being in an alliance than being at war, so there was no ""Soviet problem"" to be dealt with. There are a few historians who make the case that the Soviets were poised to invade Germany in 1941, but it's not widely accepted on either side due to lack of evidence.  Hitler chose to attack Russia before finishing off Britain because he thought Britain was on its knees, and posed no imminent future threat. In fact he expected they would eventually stop fighting his ""great Germanic cause"", as he had considerable personal respect for how successful the British Empire had been, and gave the credit for that to its supposedly Anglo-Saxon (i.e. Germanic) leadership.  Hitler felt pressure to attack the Soviet Union as soon as possible because he knew their military was in a period of temporary weakness of leadership, due to what's now known as the Great Purge. He made it pretty clear in Mein Kampf that Russia and Communism were right up there with Jews as his primary targets."

imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,whangadude,12,Tue Jun 23 15:28:28 2015 UTC,"The thing with any of these Axis victory maps is that we all know how much of a dick Hitler was, does anyone really believe he wouldn't stab Italy in the back a few years after it was all over? Or let the untermensch Kingdoms of Hungary, Romania or Bulgaria live? If he had won it would of been constant war for generations until only one race remained."
imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,BigBadBorz,27,Mon Jun 22 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Copied from the original post that answers this:   Contrary to the stereotypical ""dictator-wanting-world-domination"", Hitler never wanted that much territory to him, nor he wanted all of Europe to be part of Germany, he just wanted all countries in Europe to turn Fascist, with Germany as its leader, like the EU and Brussels as its capital.   Now to be more specific, the ""Aryan Race"" theory didn't worked like this (please correct me if i am wrong):  There were five ""Aryan"" subraces, the Nordic (Germanics), Mediterranean (Italic/Romance), Dinaric (Slovenian?/Croatian?/Albanian?), Alpine (French?/Southwestern European/Celtic), and East Baltic (Prussians), he also mentioned a lot of the ""Anglic-Celtic/Anglo-Celtic/Saxonic/Celt-Saxon"" Race (as featured in my map) whom Britons and Scots were this race, but as soon as the UK told Hitler to fuck off, Hitler abandoned this Sixth Aryan race theory, saying that they were Jews in disguise, also bringing up the propaganda that Jews are able to disguise themselves among Aryans (i guess this is when he shat himself that both UK and USSR had declared war on him, so he let ""Disguised Jews"" fight for him, what a fucking hypocrite).  The ""Nordic"" race was considered to be the most powerful race of this group, and Aryan states for each race would be created, with the Nordic state ruling over this United Nations-like bullshit (whom, my map represents this), this is mainly because this whole National Socialist and Aryan theories come way before Hitler joined the NDSAP, so world domination was still not fully their ideology back then.  About what you said:    He wouldn't stab Italy in the back a few years after it was all over?   The true and actual enemy of Germany in an Axis Victory would be at all costs Japan, Hitler even mentioned this a lot in real life, stating that Japan would get so powerful that Germany or Japan would have to Annihilate each other in a massive war to see which race would be the dominant.  I think that overall Hitler saw the Japanese as a threat because they were extremely Jingoist and wanted equal power:   the populous Asian continent was seen as the greatest threat to hegemony of the white race. The Japanese people were characterized as 'culture-bearers', meaning they could make use of the technological and civilizational achievements of the Aryan race and by so doing maintain an advanced society, but could not truly create 'culture' themselves.   A lot of Axis victory books tell us that endless cycle of two powers winning a war and then going in a cold war against themselves, for example, our real-life cold war is the Communism vs. Capitalism one where the US and USSR teamed up against Germany, making them both world powers, which results in diplomatic and economic warfare to see who would really dominate the world  If the Axis won the war, it would be Nazism vs. Shintoism (Japan was clearly fascist, but they had a more ""spiritual"" tone to it).  Mussolini as you said, was shitting his pants 24/7, firstly he was the one who said that the Mediterran race was superior to the Nordics, but when it became clear that Germany would in fact be more powerful than Italy (after the economic crisis), Italy started to insist to Germany that they had Nordic features due to Germanic migrations to the Roman Empire in the 5th century, this wasn't to create hostilities towards Hitler (they never were real friends), but not to make himself be forced to obey Hitler 24/7, since of course, there is only one room for a dictator, bitch.  Hitler did a similiar thing to Bulgaria, Croatia, and Slovakia, they were all Slavs (sub-humans subject to extermination), but since they would be close allies in the war, Hitler invented some sort of story to later say that the Jews lied after the war, an example would be that Slovaks were actually Goths mixed with Slavs, the Croats were actually a Slavic-Speaking Mediterran race victim of race mixing, and Bulgarians were Turkmen.  Fucking humans, this will always happen as wars go on."
imaginarymaps,3ar7nt,metastasis_d,6,Mon Jun 22 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"It's fascinating how they talk in such certain terms about what the end game will be. Not that Germany and Japan would fight, but that there would have to be a showdown to determine which fascist state would come out on top.  What's fascinating about it to me is that all these 'theorists' ,if you can call them that, essentially took a freeze-frame of one moment in human history (their own) and extrapolated it to be the entire future. There was no room for their world view (or the state of the world between WWI - WWII) to become obsolete or change... but that's precisely what happened the moment they played their part in history.  'Western' political scientists did the same thing at the end of the Cold War, with the famous example being the ""End of History"" treatise by Fukuyama.

Why would Gran Colombia reunite? What dicking did the USA receive?  Who was dicking Mexico if the USA failed so miserably? Why would France retake Louisiana and Spain take back Florida? Why has the UK lost the most important part of Canada along with the Maratimes, Quebec and Nova Scotia? Why did Russia lose its Southern Alaskan settlements? What happened to the Netherland's colonial empire? Euro coalition against it (seeing as Germany, Portugal and Austria have so much of them) Why would the UK not take the rest of Malaysia even though they had Malaca and Singapore? Why does Germany not have Alsace-Lorraine? Why did Poland gain independence along with Lithuania and much of Belarus? China seems quite powerful/stable. Why does the Netherlands have Ceylon?

By 1879 the US economy had collapsed and her armed forces were stretched thin as soldiers from the rebellious states mutinied.   Really? In the 1870s Canada was utterly insignificant, economically speaking, compared to the US. Until the 20th century the Maritimes and Newfoundland were economic satrapies of New England, not Ontario or the UK. When young Nova Scotians c. 1870 that wanted to seek his fortune in the big city, or look for a job as an upstairs maid, went to Boston, not Toronto or Montreal or London.  Yes, yes, the pre-1812 potential rebellion by New England. The factors behind that were irrelevant 60 years later, just as they were irrelevant when New England provided hundreds of thousands of men for the Union Army.  While the effort you put into this and other maps is commendable, you have to either a) wave your hand and present them as they are, with no attempt to explain them, or b) provide sensible backgrounds.

In the 1914 census Greeks composed less than 10% of the Empire's population.

You're better off using a computer program.  Campaign Cartographer is $45 at Amazon, and can create several styles of maps of the types found in fantasy novels.  You can learn how to use it in a couple of hours.  Draw a large outline map, showing just the land/sea borders, then scan it into your computer.  You add all the labels and geographic features in the program.  Then if you like, you can do some post-processing touch up in Photoshop, Paintshop Pro, or GIMP (freeware)."

imaginarymaps,39pmzm,legitprivilege,19,Sat Jun 13 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"I notice that there are a lot of maps featuring ""broken-up North America"", but Canada and Mexico are usually just afterthoughts compared to all the action going on in the USA. Maybe Quebec has left, maybe Cascadia exists and owns all of Alaska + the BC interior somehow, but that's about it. So here is my own little attempt at busting up my province of Alberta, not meant to be taken entirely seriously. The timeline here is a bit loose but I guess this is at least a few decades into the future, after something bad happens to the oil sands along with the rest of the world and the province is essentially left to its own devices. Most of these states are agriculturally self-sufficient but they have some economic problems. I usually just made the largest cities capital cities, but a couple were picked for different reasons. I tried to make the colours kinda thematic.  For reference: the province today  In no particular order...   Peace River Nation - The Peace River Country is the northernmost grain-growing region in the world, or so the tourist brochures say. If you check out a satellite map, the oddly-shaped farmland here is separated from the rest of agricultural North America by a thick belt of forest. This country has a large indigenous population and its ties with the other countries are not particularly strong. Instead, it co-operates closely with the people of the North-West Territories (which, with their tiny population and tradition of consensus government, have remained intact). The towns of the Peace River Country across the border in British Columbia have also effectively joined the Peace River Nation. ""Wasteland"" - Not really a country, more like a failed state. Once the oil stopped flowing, the money stopped flowing and nobody ever cleaned up the mess here. Fort McMurray now has a population in the double-digits and nobody wants to go up here because of all the pollution. Probably there are some fires that will burn forever. Free Dominion of Athabasca - The Athabasca River flows through here. It's not densely populated. Athabasca isn't the largest town here but it has the distinction of being a full-fledged university town despite its small population of ~4,000 - so I figured it would make a nice capital. Republic of the Capital - Edmonton and the Capital Region amalgamated into one enlightened republic, often at war with the New Western Empire in the south. Exerts significant influence over its surroundings and claims to be the rightful capital of a united Alberta but expansionist hopes are currently on the back burner. Republic of Kalyna - The center of Ukrainian culture in Canada, this region has a large population of Eastern European settlers. Vegreville is about 40% Ukrainian in 2015, but many refugees from whatever has happened in the Ukraine proper have moved here in an attempt to preserve their culture and the balance has been tipped. This country is most likely bilingual. Yellowhead Free State - Another forested area with some industry, named for the highway that runs through it. The southern chunk of this country is claimed by the N.W.E. but only a bit of that claim is currently under their control. P.R. Elizabeth 2 - Named for the Elizabeth 2 Highway between Edmonton and Calgary, which has not been properly maintained but is still pleasantly walkable. Red Deer - Attempts to establish independence by the citizens of Alberta's third-largest city have been smothered by an ongoing territorial dispute between the Republic of the Capital and the N.W.E., usually in favour of the N.W.E. but the situation is unstable. Kingdom of Parkland - One of the new monarchies in the South, there are few large population centres here but mostly just a lot of farmland. The Kingdom is supported by a strong military composed of the remnants of CFB Wainwright (a huge base for a small town) and is able to pursue an independent foreign policy. Mountainous Communes - Very few people live here, but they control the mountain passes and frequently block off the roads leading into British Columbia. They might be affiliated with other utopian communes in the B.C. interior but few have the chance to find out. Grand Duchy of Badlands - A monarchy in personal union with the N.W.E., controlling the fossil-rich scrublands of the south. New Western Empire - Calgary and surroundings, most likely led by the descendants of Mayor Nenshi. A confident young state, led by Calgarians who are proud to finally live in a capital city. The chinook winds and sunny climate have enabled the Empire to be one of the few places in Canada to maintain a functioning electrical grid. Palliser Principality - Another lower-level monarchy in the south-east corner, named after Palliser's Triangle, the arid region of the Prairies that's not totally suitable for farming. New Deseret - Mormons fleeing persecution in the United States fled to Alberta early in the last century, and the first Mormon temple outside the USA was built in Cardston, Alberta. New Deseret is technically a theocracy but the legacy of civil government is strong so few extreme policies are enacted - however there are limits on certain freedoms and the Hutterite minority (an even more dedicated religious group) often finds itself harassed."

The United States exists, but after the crisis, it has become a unitary republic with an even stronger surveillance program to quell any future unrest.

Ukraine and Serbia fall into further unrest, splitting in half amidst further civil war. Russia's acquisiton of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk is finally recognized after threats of shutting off gas to Europe.  Morocco invades Western Sahara after terroristic affiliation with local leaders of the unrecognized nation. Mali and Mauritania, Central African Republic and South Sudan, and Nigeria, Togo, and Cameroon unite under their own nations in accordance with the Khartoum Treaty in an effort to spark post-industrialization in Africa. Somalia splits in half (like Ukraine and Serbia), and Somalialand (in the north) invades Djibouti.  Palestinian nationalists topple the Israeli government after US pulls out relations, leading to unrest as ethnic conflict was further spurred. Kurdistan forms in the aftermath of Turkish and Iraqi governmental collapse, vowing to quell unrest in the region. Saudi Arabia occupies Yemen, and after Oman declares war in retaliation, SA and UAE partition the nation leaving only the capitol province. Cyprus unites under an independent banner. Qatar and Bahrain sling shit at each other before and during the World Cup, leading into a continual conflict in the region.

Why do these imaginary maps that break up the US always omit the much more substantial non-Quebec separatist feelings north of the 49th? Western alienation in Canada, for example, is—while still not an active secession movement—a very real and longstanding sentiment, and more ""real"" than the nonexistent Cascadian/Texan/Californian independence movements that always pop up out of nowhere to capture widespread popular support in seemingly half of all /r/imaginarymaps submissions.   US pops after an economic collapse sometime in the late '10s.   The US gets more than 70% of Canada's exports and provides more than 60% of imports.

On the other hand, not only are there genuine independence movements in Russia, there is also a steadily weakening economy.

imaginarymaps,399blp,Cabes86,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:39:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the big thing is, a survey some time ago found that 30% of Texans would currently vote for secession. And there are several independence movements; Cali might not have one, but Texas, Cascadia, and the Native Americans all have their own movements. So the population of people who would rather self-proclaim their own distinct nation in the region they live in is very much alive and well.  And in the case of the US, I'm not talking about something like the recession. I'm talking Great Depression 2.0, where dollar bills are used for kindling and wallpaper. Not sure about other states or regions in the country, but several people and politicians in Texas are preparing for such a potential crisis and are trying to be as financially independent as possible. Texas gets something like $0.95 for every dollar we send in to the federal government, we have the 13th largest economy compared to all other nations, and we recently voted to build our own bullion (aka, our own Fort Knox).  So yeah, Texas would either be an autonomous bastion or an independent nation if the US economy collapsed hard enough. Other states may follow suit and do so in violation of Texas v. White (unilateral secession), but a devastated economy in this scenario may not be able to fund the troops necessary to take back the land."

Just looking at the thing you can imagine different stories happening in every section of the world, and there's no worry about realism or believability getting in the way of things. There's a huge island in the middle of a lake, a grotto in the middle of a mountain range, a volcano next to swamps, and it just goes on and on. I'm not saying these don't naturally exist in our world, but they're usually very rare and spread out with boring or bland locations in between. Here, it's all thriller and no filler. All the cool parts of the world are stacked right next to each other so it's one hit after another.   Realism has its place, and lots of worlds go that way very successfully, like Westeros or with alternate history maps we see here. But if I'm just looking at a map on this subreddit with no background to it and no investment in any of its lore, I want the map to be the story; I want to see what's cool and interesting about the world to get me to want more. Just looking at this map I want to see more. Even if this was just a top-down world map of an RPG I would be all over it. If this was an open world game I would be in heaven getting to explore.  EDIT: It appears this map was for a game that was shut down in 2012. It was a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) which had content generated by users. I'm not familiar with this genre, but it looks like a persistent-world, user generated roguelike. I found a map of the world with text on certain areas (http://i.imgur.com/z0H3eIW.jpg), and I gotta say this kinda lessens my excitement a bit. Again, it might be because I had built-up what I felt was a cooler world in my head and then I see someone's else interpretation of it which could never match up. But reading names like ""Jorgund Plains"" and ""Bay of Blood"" mean nothing to me, and it's like their attempt to impress me lessens the impact. I want to be shown, not told I guess."

imaginarymaps,38xcbl,TMWNN,3,Mon Jun 8 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry for all the artifacts, but I forgot to save it as a .png, and the base map that I downloaded from here was a JPEG.  EDIT: Forgot to add context!  The POD for this map's timeline is around the middle of the first century AD, when Boudicca united some British Celtic tribes in revolt against the Roman emperor Nero. In this timeline, however, Boudicca is successful, and Nero withdraws all Legion troops and abandons Britain. Shortly after this, Britain was invaded by several kingdoms of Ireland, jointly led an early High King, conquered most of Britain and Scotland. By this point, with the perceived threat of the Roman Empire gone, the alliance forged by Boudicca was in shambles, and the attack came suddenly enough that the Irish forces were able to overwhelm the British Celts.  Through the conquered people as well as some Roman citizens that were left behind, the Irish learned of other Celts in Brettony and Iberia, and after the death of Nero in 68, the Irish continued their conquest, taking advantage of the confusion in the interregnum to take control of what they percieved as rightfully Irish. The result was control of most of the northern Iberian peninsula; from as far south as real-world Porto, Portugal to Bilbao, Spain; and Amorica and beyond, from Bordeaux, France to The Hague and Rotterdam, Netherlands.  Although there were a few minor wars between Rome and the new Irish empire once the former stabilized, the Irish were able to keep most of their newfound territory, and the two major powers assumed a diplomatically neutral stance towards each other. It was during this time that the Irish began to colonize the Orkneys, Shetlands, and Faroe Islands, although their largest colonized land, Iceland, was colonized much later.     The yellow dots are supposed to indicate the capitals of each empire: Tara for the Irish, and Rome for the Romans. The greatest extent of the Irish Empire is in green, while Roman territory is in red."

imaginarymaps,38syhe,RiskyBrothers,10,Sat Jun 6 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"Here's a pic of what the national legislatures might look like.  http://i.imgur.com/mHTjYWx.png  Cascadia: Minority government under the Cascadia National Party with supply from the Labor Party and the Cascadia Party.  Originally a coalition was planned between the Cascadia National Party, Labor party and Green party. However the Green party became unrelenting over wanting a carbon tax and increasing taxes on automobile transport and higher tolls to reduce car usage and carbon usage overall. The Labor party broke off fearing a split of support if they were in government to the greens as a protest vote by the left. Meanwhile the Cascadia party decided to support the Cascadia National Party in return for upholding gun rights, and putting future tax increases to a national referendum instead of having it going through the legislature where a majority leftwing parliament would of approved any increases in taxes very easily.  Cascadia party's base is in the suburban and rural areas attached to the state. Cascadia National Party has its main base in Seattle and the Portland area. Labor party has its main base of support amongst rural manufacturing counties. While the Green party other than having support amongst progressives in Portland won a plurality in the city but otherwise has no defined areas of support with its votes coming from across the country.   Nuevo mexico: Grand coalition between the Ciudadanos, Liberal Alianza, and Socialdemocrata party.   The party de la raza is a far-left, irrendentist party that seeks to have the newly formed country to be incorporated with Mexico.   Ciudadanos draws most of its votes from former moderate democrats and republicans prior to the breakup of the US.   Liberal Alianza has its base in the former republican suburbs as well as a growing base of support amongst former democrat leaning suburbanites around the bay area including silicon valley.   The Party de la Raza remains the only party still supporting open borders. Although owing to their large hispanic voter base, originally all of the three larger parties were in favor of amnesty, however repeated attempts of influxes from the mexican border have lead to all three parties agreeing to militarize the border to prevent repeated crossings. Unlike the other parties that support a policy of official bilingualism, the party of La Raza encourages a monolingual spanish language policy that has severely hampered its support amongst the public.  Hawaii: Dominant one party rule under the Hawaii party.  Hawaii party a center-left party is voted in with a supermajority with the conservative party made up of formerly republican voters in the state being the token opposition. Most of the conservative party issues deals mainly with tax issues.  Greater Texas: Grand Coalition with the Motherland Party, National Front Party, Christian heritage party.  All left wing parties are banned in this country. Under the rule of this coalition the nation of Greater Texas implements increasingly religious theocratic laws. All children are taught from kindergarten about the bible. Evolution is banned and abortion near totally restricted.   The Confederate States of America: Coalition between the National Party, National Front Party, and the Christian Democrats.  Blacks boycott elections and any left wing party which would of been voted mainly by blacks have zero representation in the house of congress.   The Libertarian party unexpectedly wins more seats than usual. With a unholy alliance between Secular/nonreligious/atheist suburbanite former democrats and republicans. socially liberal former democrats. and wealth voters.  Wins many suburban seats across the south with a 56% showing in Florida, helped in part to the many suburban areas in Florida that were also uneasy about the evangelicalism of many of the other parties.   The Christian Democrats do well in many areas of the poorer Appalachian region that despite being religious are suspicious of the National party and runs on a more centrist economic line than the National party.   National Front Party a far right party with a huge emphasis on gun ownership and welfare chauvinism gains amongst white voters surrounding the black belt.  National Party considered the spiritual successor to the Republican party. Is a economically right-wing party with a large evangelical base, dominating non-black belt and non-Appalachian areas of the confederacy.   A coalition pact is signed after first elections. With the  National party, National Front party and the Christian democrats forming a coalition to lock out the Libertarian party.  The three parties agree to have laws banning abortion, restricting gay marriage. and restrictions on welfare. Along with religious laws similar to ones in place in texas.  New Quebec: Single party rule by the We Party.  We party draws many of its support amongst moderate rural areas.   The economically right wing people's party has support mainly in suburban new hampshire areas that were republican strongholds in the state prior to the breakup of the US.  Labor party is mainly based amongst left wing cities in maine and the Vermont area.  Socialist Republic of the Atlantic: Coalition between the Labor Party and the Green party.  Labor Party and the Green party sources its votes from leftleaning urban areas and suburbs.  The Revolutionary marxist party sources its votes from the poorer black and hispanic areas in the inner urban cores.  Liberal party a center-right party has its support from wealthy suburban areas and is opposed to gun control, taxes and redistribution of wealth.  Iron Range: Grand coalition between the Labor Party and the Iron Range Alliance.  Labor party is mainly based in the inner city areas and rural manufacturing counties.  Iron Range Alliance has its based in rural areas of Iron Range and the suburbs.  Rather than becoming a opposition party the Iron Range Alliance decided to form a grand coalition with the Labor Party in support of moderate policies.  Jesusland: Grand Coalition between the Evangelical People's Party and the Mormon Temple Party.  Evangelical People's party sources its votes from the rural and suburban areas of this frontier west nation.   Temple party is a mormon based party that has a following in the Mormon or ""Jell-o corridor"" and supports mormonization of the areas that mormons are a majority.  The Social Democrats is popular amongst many city areas that are suspicious of evangelical christian policies. Along with areas with large numbers of Native Americans.  Despite the Evangelical People's Party being dominant a pact is formed with the Temple Party where the Temple Party in return for supporting the Evangelical People's Party where the Temple Party would give up attempts of mormonization, a looser mormonization policy would be allowed to be implemented only in Utah and has to be voluntarily.   Analysts say that this done by the Temple party to prevent attempts by some within the party to demand an independent mormon state which would not survive on its own while staying in the Jesusland nation would allow economic stability that would not exist if the mormon areas were its own state. In return the Evangelical People's Party would implement bans on abortion and allow the bible to be a mandatory course in Public Schools.  Notes  1) Oh for those who were wondering about the areas the National Front parties were dominant. I based it mainly on the performance of Segregationist George Wallace in 1968.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/1968prescountymap2.PNG  Although George Wallace had a great showing in the whole of the south, his particular base was southern whites living in the black belt. Along with the areas eastern boundaries of Texas and Oklahoma. And much less so in the non-black belt areas.  2)   The Christian Democrats party in the confederacy, i used this map of food stamp usage.  http://i.imgur.com/2aXe0BE.png  And i modeled them with the Christian democratic parties in europe where they have christian based parties that are centrist and support a high degree of welfare payments amongst the poor. To contrast them with the National Party which was based off the Republican party which instead is economically right wing and does not support welfare to a large extent.  3)   Ciudadanos ----> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_%28Spanish_political_party%29  Liberal Alianza ----> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Alliance_Party_%28Mexico%29  Cascadia National Party -----> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party  4) The Mid-west has a ton of ethnic germans so i thought it would be approporiate to have the larger center-left and center-right party in a coalition because thats the current coalition in power in Germany at the moment.  5) Christian heritage party is mainly based on this.  https://philebersole.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/adherents.gif  The Texas Panhandle and eastern oklahoma has a very high religious adherence rate, even higher than many parts of the South.   6) Temple party = Jell-o Belt  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/LDS_Percentage_of_Population_2000.PNG  However despite winning more than the Social Democrats in regards to land. Their areas are so unpopulated that they are way behind the Social Democrats who on the otherhand has an edge in more populated cities in Jesusland."

Not only does the map include all of North America, but it is even Labeled as North America on Deviant Art.  That said, I'm curious about the division of states presented here. Principalities on NA seem weird but interesting. I'm guessing in the absence of a strong, expanding US nation, that Mexico Balkanized and the remaining southern states re-united as an American Republic, while the northern states like California and Texas remained independent.   I'm also very interesting in this independent Quebec. Quebec nationalism aside, Quebec as an independent principality implies something very different from actual history occurred. Also, as an Aside, Montreal as the Capital of Quebec seems unlikely. Quebec City is 40 years older than Montreal and economically in a much better position, being near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River.

This seems to have a huge focus on the differences between Virginia, MD/DE, and the Northeast, without much distinction between PA/WNY and New England/Upstate NY (HUGE difference), and too much distinction between northern New England and Nova Scotia / Quebec (much less difference). I'm also not seeing the flag of flyover country there... is that just being completely ignored due to low population density and a poor grasp on regional allegiance? Because I'm pretty sure there are still people there, with strong regional allegiance, and they would not just ally for the sake of land area when their biggest problem as parts is a lack of population to hold large areas. Plus, why do you cut off Northern Quebec? Cultural French Canada is not confined to the cities, and it goes all the way to the top. I guess I'm missing a lot of the backstory here!"

Basically picture this big wall of mountains that are so large, that they block any form of plantlife or rainy weather from crossing over them. Further, if any seeds/plantlife were to miraculously reach the peak of the mountain, it would be far too cold and the atmosphere would be far too thin for the seeds to even begin to sprout. Finally, in the event that a cloud were to drift towards the peak, it would also freeze and form an ice cap at the peak of the mountain (basically, the layer of snow you see on mountains, regardless of the time of year.)  Rainshadow deserts are actually extremely common in most parts of the world--a good example would be the entire state of Nevada, as well as virtually every desert that occurs around the western US/Rocky Mountain region."

Yes, the Alaska Highway exists, but those in Whitehorse would never drive to Anchorage for a big-city experience; they'd fly, and then they might as well fly to Edmonton or Calgary or Vancouver.

Dead for the time being, sure, but Quebec is just 1 shitty phrase uttered out of Ottawa from taking to the streets. If there was some comment about Harper that was said in private that become public that was either anti quebec or anti francophone, the referendum debate would get very real very quickly despite the election results last April.   There's a general balance between the ""we don't think we can economically do it on our own"" and ""the anglos oppress us"", right now the economic angle wins, but if they perceive the oppression to increase it can and will outweigh that."

imaginarymaps,38di6d,Samwell_,7,Wed Jun 3 15:39:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the inclusion of an independent Quebec is both lazy – hey, it nearly happened once, why not include it? – and a token of legitimacy for the others. If ""possible"" is the only criteria, free of any sense of likelihood (Cascadia), why not an independent Minnesota? A Western Washington-Vancouver Island union? Quebec remaining in Canada but Ontario leaving? That sort of thing.

Look at Scotland. 10 years ago, who on Earth thought that they'd so much as hold a referendum on independence in 2014, let alone see the SNP sweep nearly every seat in the nation this year?  A lot can happen politically in a very short time span."

imaginarymaps,38di6d,rekjensen,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"A sovereignty movement has to win over the hearts and minds of the people outside of the realm of politics first.  Only then can it have a foundation strong enough to actually get something done politically in a democratic society.  That's the mistake with independence movements - everyone focuses on politics first.  The foundation of any successful movement is societal identity & ethos.  If Quebec's is inseparable from the Canadian national ethos, then surely the likelihood of Quebec ever seceding is next to nothing.  But if Quebec's identity is rooted in something fundamentally different from the rest of Canada, and that identity has the potential to strengthen again, who's to say support for Quebec independence won't increase again in the future?"

Here's a little map project I've been tinkering with for a bit, an imagined colony on a much more temperate version of the Kerguelen Islands. The outline of the map is derived from the main map there. The colony is divided into fifteen states, each of which is divided into a number of counties. The county splits towards the end of the animation are to accommodate increasing population density. The states are as follows:   Ouest (yellow) - population 4.176 million; rough coastal area beneath the massive Cook Glacier wilderness anchored by Ile de l'Ouest. Loranchet (maroon) - population 7.429 million; a heavily dissected coastal region relying on its maritime resources. Gramont (gold) - population 4.921 million; small and focused on using its strategic waterways for trade. Cook (light green) - population 2.265 million; rural scrub ascending towards the glacial highlands. Foch (medium blue) - population 7.404 million; a powerful state anchored on the hospitable Ile Foch. Joffre (beige) - population 3.335 million; a small state on a sheltered inlet, overshadowed by two larger neighbors. Hillsborough (purple) - population 6.775 million; a well-balanced center of business. Marville (lavender) - population 2.238 million; a small state on a low-lying, exposed, sandy plain with population centered along the coast of Lac Marville. Courbet (red) - population 7.190 million; an old powerhouse controlling some of the best agricultural land in the colony plus important port cities. Malloy (green) - population 3.986 million; an old and somewhat forgotton region with a rural forested north. Ronarch (brown) - population 3.348 million; a minor and divided region. Bizet (dark blue) - population 7.358 million; quite expansive despite being sandwiched by its neighbors, reaching from southern fjords through fertile islands to the lakes of the northern plateau. Joan of Arc (orange) - population 7.287 million; solid control of the most important bay on the south of the island and many beautiful lakes. Gallieni (pink) - population 5.657 million; a pleasant coast with a desolate hinterland, most of its growth is along the fjordlands. Sables (light blue) - population 3.599 million; grew strongly along its sheltered bay and lush inland valley, with a finger reaching towards the hills of the glacial highlands."

Different colors for the different lines, of course, with the translucent gray lines in the background being proposed future MTA lines.  Given the history of Pasadena-D, a lot of the lines follow old P.E. routes, while others use former rail routes of other carriers. Leaving Union Station, the lines all travel in (Pas-D) freeway corridors for at least a few miles...all the way to El Monte, for the San Bernadino line. That makes the westward running section very crowded and the MTA is currently asking for submissions to correct this bottleneck.  Interestingly - and all due to a Great Depression program - only the line actually through Pasadena is a subway, all else is surface/elevated."

However, it's incredibly confusing if you're at stop ""A"" and want to get to stop ""B"". Do you have to transfer? Does that train even stop there?  Thus, the schematic type metro map, because anyone can follow a straight line.  So, one map to figure out where you want to get off, another to figure out how to get there from here."
imaginarymaps,37qnzc,marshallknight,8,Fri May 29 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"This is my first post, but I love so much of the material that comes out of these subreddits.  Anyway, this is my LA future metro rail map. I'm standing on the shoulders of Nick Andert and Yunquio Zhao, both of whom have created incredible proposals. Andert's ""Metro 2040"" map is very grounded, incorporating just about every existing proposal ever touched on in the Metro Long Range Plan into a network that we really could see in 20-30 years. Zhao's map, by comparison, is deliriously forward-thinking, throwing in the kitchen sink to extend rail lines deep into the Inland Empire and Orange County.  Basically, I tried to fold the best ideas from those two maps together into a coherent version, and add a few ideas of my own to gel them. I haven't given them any formal names (the Metro naming system is up in the air, with a changeover to letter-based naming seeming likely), but here are the different lines sorted by color:  HRT (Thicker lines)  Black: Sylmar - Westwood - LAX Red: Burbank - Hollywood - DTLA - Santa Ana Purple: Santa Monica - DTLA - Whittier - Brea Pink: Santa Monica - WeHo - DTLA - El Monte - Pomona Light Blue: Venice - Culver - WeHo - DTLA - Monterrey Park - Pomona Lime Green: Venice - Culver - Mid-Wilshire - Echo Park - Glendale Brown: San Pedro - Pico-Union - Echo Park - Glendale  LRT (Skinnier lines)  Blue: Chatsworth - Burbank - DTLA - Long Beach Yellow: Warner Center - Burbank - Glendale - Pasadena - Claremont Orange: Redondo Beach - LAX - South Park - DTLA - Pasadena - Claremont Gold (FKA Expo): Santa Monica - Expo Park - DTLA - Whittier Light Pink: Santa Monica - LAX - Anaheim - Santa Ana Light Purple (FKA Crenshaw): Hollywood - LAX - Torrance - Long Beach - Seal Beach Green: Torrance - El Segundo - Anaheim - Santa Ana Tan: Hermosa Beach - Cerritos - Whittier - Industry - Duarte  Other details worth noting:   The Orange between LAX and DTLA is the ""LAX express"" -- I would've made it HRT except that the obvious alignment follows the Crenshaw Line, which is and LRT already under construction. But I figure if it's completely grade-separated and with few stops, even an LRT line should be able to make that run very quickly.  Nick Andert's Metro 2040 Map had a line running from the SFV to DTLA and then double back along the ""LAX Express"" corridor, but as part of my effort to make every line cross every other line at least once, I opted to swap the upper half of that line with the upper half of the Blue (in the current plan, the Blue goes Northeast to Pasadena/Azusa instead of Northwest to Burbank and Chatsworth).  I'm also not sure what the reality would be for the Lime Green as it winds between the Grove, LACMA and La Cienega. My guess is that it would realistically have to skip one or the other of the Purple Line stops, but I'm not an engineer, so maybe it could be done as pictured. I've gotten some grief before (in a different forum) for previous map sketches, about West Side bias. I hope this alleviates some of that issue. Obviously the East Side, Gateway Cities and South Bay lines are a little sparser, but I'm trying to stand by the fairly well-established tenets of what constitutes the ""center"" of LA, and putting the highest density of lines there. Obviously a huge proportion of people live in the Eastern, Southeastern and Southern parts of the city, but the concentration of jobs are largely in the area between DTLA and Century City, bounded on the South by Wilshire Blvd, and on the North by Santa Monica Blvd, Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Blvd. For the purposes of designing my map, that is LA's ""Manhattan,"" and I tried to treat it accordingly.  Hopefully further alleviating any suggestion of bias is the Tan Line (which is pretty fun to say.) It's the last thing I added and entirely my own invention, although it wouldn't surprise me if many others had had the idea independently. Basically it runs along Artesia, the 91 and 605 freeways. Obviously nobody likes riding in the center of a freeway, but without a ""ring road"" type line binding the East and South extremities of the map together, almost all trips between those outer regions would require traveling first in the direction of DTLA and then back out again in another direction. Because it would by necessity be grade-separated, I thought this Artesia/605 LRT alignment would be the cheapest and simplest way to build a line shuttling between the ""outer boroughs,"" much like the proposed Bronx/Queens/Brookyln X Line would in New York.  Thanks for checking it out!"

I like to think that these find their way over there and they listen to what people are talking about and are enthusiastic about.

Living in NYC I love the subway system and can't imagine living in a huge city without extensive public transit.   The only thing I can imagine hurting this design is that the area it covers in MASSIVE.  I did a comparison of the size of this proposed design and overlaid it on a map of NYC and the area covered by this is easily 3 time larger.  The ride to get from one end of a line to the other is incredibly long in NYC and I imagine that it would be even longer in a system like this.  This isn't to say that this isn't a fantastic design.  More just a general astonishment at how big LA and the surrounding cities are.
imaginarymaps,37qnzc,PapaFranzBoas,3,Fri May 29 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is inarguably huge. But there are a couple mitigating factors:  The total area compared to NYC's transit coverage may be 3x, but the longest lines are only about 50% longer than NYC's longest (the A Train in NYC is 31 miles; the distance between Santa Ana and Burbank Airport [Red Line] is ~46 miles).    Then there's the Metrolink and Amtrak, which offer more direct commuter service if all you're trying to do is get to Downtown from the exburbs. It raises the question, ""Well isn't all this Metro service redundant?"" But I don't think so, because it gives you so many local options -- you'd never expect anyone to take a ride end-to-end, but you could certainly expect someone to want to be able to ride from say El Monte to Hollywood without a transfer. And that's really the idea -- the most destinations possible, with the fewest transfers required."

This system is incredibly smart though, for instance if you live in West Hollywood and wanted to go the Venice Beach I assume now you have to drive, but with this it looks like a reasonable train ride. I also imagine it would save an incredible amount on pollution. Have there been any serious studies on the economic and environmental impact a system of this scope would have?"

The Red Country between Persia and Azerbaijan that I forgot to label is intended as a homeland for the Tat People.

There are four regions, Phoenicia, Palestina II, Palestina I and Palestina III/Salutaris.  Lebanon was known as Phoenica back then in 400 AD (did the Ottomans treat it as part of Palestine or not?)  Palestina II is Galillee and Golan.  Palestina I is the rest of it, while the Negev is part of Sinai (confusingly called Palestina III/Salutaris).  Now, compare that with the territory claimed here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Kingdoms_of_Israel_and_Judah_map_830.svg/720px-Kingdoms_of_Israel_and_Judah_map_830.svg.png (This map and the next shown here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah )  Those two kingdoms of Israel and Judea (if they even existed as one and then two self-governing nations, which is questionable) don't seem to follow the natural geographic boundaries. Jerusalem is not in ""Israel"", rendering the claim on it for a capital even more tenuous.  The two nations are much smaller than the natural geographic unit - so this ""nation"" was never going to survive much beyond 100 years united and 100 years divided that we're maybe persuaded they covered in the 8th Century BCE.    ""The Kingdom of Israel emerged as an important local power by the 9th century BCE before falling to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722 BC. Israel's southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th century BC[1]"" says the Zionist controlled Wonkypedia.    Why is that important? Because those two kingdoms were ""Jewish"" before Judaism was recognisably monotheistic!  The invention of Judaism (somewhere between 601BC and 699BC) seems to coincide with the fall of the Kingdoms!  Says the top archaeology book on the subject ""The Bible Unearthed"" (2001) by Israel Finkelstein, director of Tel Aviv University's excavations at Megiddo and archaeology historian and journalist Neil Asher Silberman.     p.2 ... the seventh-century leaders in Jerusalem, headed by King Josiah - a sixteenth-generation descendant of King David - declared all traces of foreign worship to be anathema, and indeed the cause of Judah's current misfortunes.   They embarked on a vigorous campaign of religious purification in the countryside, ordering the destruction of rural shrines, declaring them to be sources of evil.   Henceforth, Jerusalem's Temple, with its inner sanctuary, altar, and surrounding courtyards at the summit of the city would be recognized as the only legitimate place of worship for the people of Israel. In that innovation, modern monotheism was born.    Hence the archaeology (at least, according to Finkelstein and Silberman) date the birth of Judaism to the 7th Century BC, no earlier than 699BC. Making nonsense of the claim that either of the twin kingdoms was governed by people we'd nowadays recognise as Jews.  At the same Wikipedia article, see what's claimed for the Hasmoneese period (self-governing for 100 years until the Romans arrived in 63 BCE) - map is at: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Hasmoneese_rijk.PNG   That later kingdom includes Golan and Gaza but not Lebanon or Negev.  In fact, I've never come across any source that links Negev to Palestine - its a camel trading and pilgrimage route between Africa and Mecca (or Damascus). Not much interest to the farmers of the coastal strip and not linked to them by racial bonds.  The part I don't yet have clear in my mind is how much Lebanon is really the northern half of Palestine.

Why would you dissolve Yemen but keep Oman? Why would Alawitistan (they're not even Iranian speakers). Why is there an Arabistan in the middle of Iran when no Arabs live there? 99% of non-immigrant Arabs live in your Lur state (aka Khuzestan). Why is Assyria not anywhere near al Jazira? Assyria isn't in the Anatolia.  Why would you give Druze and Alawis a state but dissolve the Maronite state (aka Lebanon)? And why would you lump Maronites with Palestinians? Why is the Anatolian Arab state not in Hatay and in a place Arabs don't even live? Why would you even lump up Syria with Yemen?  not a fan/10

imaginarymaps,37ncar,novov,3,Fri May 29 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"I know that this isn't serious but when your looking at and interested in different cultures like this, it wouldn't be too hard to see that you should be careful in your naming of certain areas. The term Punjabistan manages to offend just about everyone in multiple ways.  Firstly it sounds like a lazy name, it comes across as equivalent to bongo-bong-land for African countries. Why not just call it the Punjab? It's a perfectly good name and it adds some variation to the sea of 'Stan' countries you currently have.  Secondly the term Punjabistan is used in current Pakistan in a semi-derogatory way, due to a perceived control of politics in Pakistan by Sikhs in the Punjab.  Next there's the fact that I'm assuming this region is supposed to be aseperate Sikh state, in which case, there was already a term for this proposed region, Khalistan. (I know another 'Stan' makes my first point look a bit irrelevant, but this was at least chosen by some people living in the region, as opposed to being forced upon them). I know that Khalistan is controversial in both India and Pakistan and that that name can be inflamitory to some Sikh Indian/ Pakistani nationalist, but if we're talking about theoretically dividing up the entire Middle-East along ethnic lines, that's already inflamitory enough to some nationalists, so why not use the name that appeases the others (then you don't have two groups shouting at you).  Finally there is a fair bit of resentment now along the Indo-Pakistan border in the Punjab and there has been a lot of Islamification (and in fairness Hinduification? on the Indian side) on the Pakistani side. This might actually have cause problems in a modern united Punjab."
imaginarymaps,37ncar,bestur,2,Fri May 29 08:22:38 2015 UTC,"Why not just call it the Punjab?   If the goal is to avoid offending people, adding ""the"" in front of the name is a bad idea.  It makes it sound subnational and exonymic, a leftover of western imperialism, and would likely cause a stir.  There are few languages in which adding the definite article to a toponym is not poltically diminishing, and Punjabi isn't one of them.  But besides all that, why not just call it ""Punjab"" or ""Pajaba"" by itself, as it is already called in its own languages (which lack definite/indefinite articles to begin with)?  Arguments for removing the article feel unnecessary, if arguments for including it are nonexistent ;).  I agree with and appreciate everything else about your post."

imaginarymaps,3788uz,blndcavefsh,5,Tue May 26 09:40:02 2015 UTC,"Since what you're using is extremely close to actual Old English, it gets a little distracting where things deviate.  It ends up reading like ""old english babytalk"" rather than merely sounding like an archaic or fantasy dialect.  This is especially true for things like ""Heortfald"", which I assume is supposed to be hart-field/deer-park, but actually modernizes as heart-field.  Other things like Blodholt aren't so much miswritten, as they don't create the same image in OE as the do in modern English.  Finally, things like Saefetre would be less confusing if the first component declined differently.  Obviously telling you to go spend a few months improving your old english is a bit of a tall order, so instead I would recommend changing the spellings and constructions more, so that it's clearly a fantasy language, and not just a shoddy attempt at Old English."

imaginarymaps,36x0wl,Gondabuggan,2,Sat May 23 08:56:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good starting point, but if you are going to take this further I would recommend reconsidering a few things. First off, your coastlines are a bit too regular. I'd recommend you making your landmasses, particularly the smaller islands, less rounded. Also, if you're going to be adding place names and so on, I would brighten the whole image. You want to be able to convey a good amount of information with a map, and that will be hard if it remains very dark. Lastly, your rivers need to taper as they reach further inland. I get that this is an early map, though, so it is no big deal.  Anyway, those are just my thoughts. The map looks great so far and I imagine it is only going to improve with time. Best of luck!"

I am wondering, with the second map you show (one with the Shimmering Strait) if the southern land mass has an inlet with an island on the left side of it? I can see you did the same thing on other inlets, having the water in between the mainland and island on a different depth than the ocean/sea level, which is definitely cool.  It looks a bit odd as is though, maybe color in the map, and make the inlet areas a lighter shade of blue compared to the oceans?

The earthquakes caused two openings for the first time in millions of years, this allowed the Krie to escape the Black Desert into the Maren Dperession, through the Dragons Mouths, but were stopped by an alliance of Elves, Dwarves, and Men. decades years after the Upheaval, the construction of the Black Gates was finished, these gates stopped the Krie from entering the Plains of Impre, but the second gate, the White Gates, were under construction and were overrun by thousands of Krie soldiers, in which the spread into the Maren Depression. A ceasefire was called after years of war, the Krie agreed. But the peace is tenuous, and many are calling to push the Krie back due to the fact that the Krie capture and sacrifice Elves, Dwarves, and Men to their Gods and eat them"

I recently finished a larger version of Virginia and North Carolina. There's more seats, vastly more detail, and all the districts have been done going by voting wards, instead of by county."
imaginarymaps,36mioh,tagehring,5,Wed May 20 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"Bonus points for not drawing any of the lines along city boundaries. In a timeline where the CSA wins, Virginia wouldn't have the quirk of being the only state with independent cities.   Although in a world where the CSA wins, Northern Virginia would be nowhere near as populated. So Fairfax County should be a lot less dense."
imaginarymaps,36mioh,ughduck,3,Wed May 20 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"What's the origin of the independent cities thing? Why would it not happen with a CSA victory? Or do you just mean it might not have, given the big divergence?  I imagine Northern Virginia would still be pretty populated. It'd be right next to the capital of a neighboring power at one of the natural places for international economic collaborations. The lack of DC government contracts would shrink things a fair bit, but then again it's not all that far from the capital of the CSA itself. It's a big step down, though."
imaginarymaps,36mioh,tagehring,3,Wed May 20 22:14:08 2015 UTC,"It's an accidental function of our 1870 state constitution, which was written as a result of Reconstruction. A CSA victory would butterfly that quirk out, I'd think.   As it stands now, something like 1 in 6 Virginians lives in Fairfax County. I'd suspect there'd be less up in Northern Virginia and more in Richmond/Hampton Roads than there are now, due to Richmond being a national capital instead of just a state capital, and the Hampton Roads area being more important as a port."

Copy-pasta'd because I just woke up and am lazy:   Genghis Khan had a government with a code name “yassa” that had a standard of equality towards everybody. He prohibited stealing, defection of soldiers, wife stealing, and other rules which made everything safer. He gave full protection to everybody and had no favorites with anybody.  The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm, instead, He believed that appointments and responsibilities should be given by talent and skills not by wealth.   Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions, and typically sponsored several at the same time. At the time of Genghis Khan in the 13th century, virtually every religion had found converts, from Buddhism to Christianity and Islam. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a shamanist. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service. Mongol emperors were known for organizing competitions of religious debates among clerics, and these would draw large audiences.   And a famous saying:   At the height of the Mongol empire, it was said that a virgin could walk, with a bar of gold balanced on her head, from one end of the empire to the other, unharmed."

Hirohito though... yea I get that he was not directly responsible for Imperial Japan's expansionist policies that made them the main Axis belligerent in the Pacific theatre of WW2, but still, if you had to put the blame on one guy (for the sake of this map's creation), I guess you could pick him as he simply was Japan's emperor at the time. In hindsight, instead of saving himself and the institution of the monarchy, he could have saved more of his own people's lives in Japan, and the countless others killed or injured in China, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Burma (Myanmar), Australia, India, the United Kingdom and the U.S.A.

Sweden's immediate declaration of war on Denmark with their British ally led to the declaration of the Empire of Scandinavia.  The British, being busy in Denmark, ignored the Belgians cry for help and the Netherlands restored order to the revolting areas.  The Kingdom of Hanover began ""diplomatic"" missions to their nearby neighbors and gained Lippe, Oldenburg and Brunswick as vassals.  Italy has had a multitude of rise-and-falls, resulting in the current three states of Venice, ""Milan"" (Sardinia-Piedmont) and the Two Sicilies.  German nationalism united the minor states within Germany early due to French ambitions to reform the Confederation of the Rhine.  India began an extremely aggressive diplomatic policy of uniting the Princely states.  Japan was invaded by China and Russia, divided by China and Russia then revolted and became independent again.  The Chinese have a Han rebellion due to rapid attempts at westernization and alliances with westerners.

Due to its innately hospitable and life-sustaining environment compared to other worlds, presumably the work of the gods, astronomers sometimes refer to Golarion as ""the Child"".

imaginarymaps,35htkm,DexticDeox,1 point,Sat May 16 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"The Eye of Abendego (pronounced ah-BEN-deh-go) is a vicious, permanent hurricane located in the southern Arcadian Ocean off the western coast of the continent of Garund (west of the Sodden Lands and north of the Shackles).   The Eye appeared in 4606 AR in what was then known as the Abendego Gulf. Although the exact cause of its appearance is unknown, it came into being after three weeks of tempest following the death of Aroden, and remains as the greatest physical evidence of the event.  The intensity of the Eye is variable. At its weakest it can tear the sails off the biggest ships. At its strongest, the wind alone can blow a large vessel into splinters. The Eye periodically spawns smaller storms which travel up and down the Garundi coast, bringing torrential rain and hurricane-speed winds to outlying regions. It is these storms that brought down the countries of Lirgen and Yamasa, creating the Sodden Lands.  It has been utilized to great effect by the pirate lords of the Shackles who hide their illegal activities behind it.  Magical divinations focused on the center of the Eye (since navigating there is impossible due to the rough seas and high winds) have discovered a large eye of calm whose waters are choked with debris."

imaginarymaps,35h2qy,Carri0nMan,3,Sun May 10 09:57:47 2015 UTC,"I suppose the first question should be are you doing to draw it by hand or map it on a computer? Never did anything on a computer so I'm no help there, but as far as hand drawing is concerned, like /u/shipanda01 said, just go for it! I usually start with drawing the coastline and refining it to a point where I am happy with it, then draw very rough, light marks where you want major features to be (forest outlines, mountain ridgelines, city walls/boundaries...) and then, once it is all pieced together, go back and fill in the details.   If you go back and do it in ink, I recommend drawing the coasts to completion and inking over them, then filling in the details (trees, mountains, streets, walls...) on the first pass. Here's an example of one I did with a quill a while back, but I don't suggest using liquid ink like that. Makes a terrible mess! If you do go for ink, try felt tip India Ink pens (mine are made by PigmaMicron).   However you go about doing it, it's always easy enough to practise drawing map features to your style on scrap paper before committing to anything on the map. My own style has changed measurable over the years from primitive graphing to more artistic cartography. Hope this helps!"

I haven't invented names yet, a working name of the city is Myneharros (from Arabic ميناء حر, ""free port"", put to Greek-like form) but I'm not quite satisfied with it so maybe I'll change it in the future.  Myneharros is a prosperous maritime city-state set on the archipelago in the Aegean Sea (loosely based on Santorini). It probably recognizes the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. Historically, it's partly based on the Duchy of Naxos and the city of Dubrovnik.   The city was established in the 9th century by Arab deserters during Byzantine-Arab wars on the place of a Greek/Byzantine fishing village. The inhabitans are therefore of Greco-Arab origins. The map portrays the city approximately in the 15th century, the smallest island is an unfinished artificial island with a military base and salt fields on it.  The world building isn't very thought-out yet, I'd like to elaborate it and eliminate plotholes and historical nonsenses later. Hope, you'll enjoy it. ;)"

Depending on the scale you could have chains that can be raised or lowered.   Assuming it is in the sea have you thought about water supply?

Thicker outlines are early design things and I'll probably replace them with thinner and more detailed shorline. I tried to highlight docks by adding piers but it didn't look good so that's why I left them there. I may add waterbreakers.  The main entrance to the bay is in the North-West (that reminds me I should add compass rose). There are two lighthouses/defense towers on the sides and the island in the middle has a fortess built on it. The North-Eastern entrance has a chain.   The smallest island is an artificial island. The three water bodies are unfinished, not dried yet parts of the island. But when I drew them, I realized they might be also salt fields which would be cool because the city would have its own export commodity. So I'm not decided yet."

Prussia was inherited mid 1800's after a series of young, sickly and feeble minded kings had brought her into near ruin. By the 1870s the King was Crowned Emperor.   Several rebellions in the Caribbean lead to small independent nations asking for Imperial help and were admitted into the Empire with great freedoms. The Prophet/King of Deseret declared God had ordered his servitude to the Empire, which happened to save it from destruction during the ""decades of the Un-United States.""  Several colonies were created Dominions in the late 1890s, given there own parliaments, this included some nations without a large white population, many at home did not like this, but they soon saw it had many positive outcomes.  In 1910 the ""Greatest War"" started, caused, in part by distrust and fury that the Kingdoms of Belgum, Rumania and Greece had joined The Empire. The remaining European powers of France, Austro-Hungary, Bavaria, Russia, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire attacked. Five long and destructive years of war followed.  Ending in the Baltic, Finland, Ukraine, Caucasus  and Eastern Siberia being taken from Russia, some turned directly into self governing semi-independent dominions, others remaining under direct Imperial control.  Bulgaria being divided between the Kingdoms of Greece and Romania, and both gaining lands from Hungary too.  The Kingdom of Greece gained much in the Ottoman Empire, which was completely destroyed. With the Arabian and Iraq areas being carefully divided up to ensure stability.  And some other stuff happened but I'm a bit too tired right now."

In theory he was supposed to like the Czechs as well, but they destroyed his affection because of the Sudeten Crisis.  He disliked the former enemies: France, Britain, Russia, Italy (it's rumored it was difficult for his generals to convince him not to attack their ally), Romania (despite being an ally Hitler forced it to give up many territories), Serbia, the US.  He also felt sympathetic towards the enemies of the enemies: the 'separatist' peoples fought or opposed France (Brittany), Britain (Ireland), and Russia (Finland, the Baltian states, the Caucasus peoples etc.)."

imaginarymaps,34yi2s,elehcimiblab,1 point,Wed May 6 00:21:44 2015 UTC,The thing about Constantinople sounds interesting. A city which is a major character in the shaping of modern history would have presumably never existed...
imaginarymaps,34yi2s,CptBigglesworth,1 point,Sat May 9 02:16:05 2015 UTC,"Constantinople it self wouldn't exist on this map, but a Constantinople like city would. There is a small water connection from the Black sea to the Caspian sea on this map. I think a Constantinople like city would form there and would bring in goods from the central Asia region now that it has a water way to the Med. Which would make for some large changes. Early empires could grow larger, central Asia is now no longer a backwater and the trade routs go through Georgia/south Russia now. To name only a few."

imaginarymaps,34yi2s,prettyold,2,Wed May 6 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"For one, the Bosphorus strait seems very expanded and what we'd think of as Constantinople wouldn't exist. I could see either the Romans still conquering Anatolia but then the Turks having a much harder time getting into the Balkans or the Roman empire not expanding that way at all in the first place and perhaps, moving further up the black sea perhaps into Ukraine or the Caucuses.  Going back even further, Sicily is now much closer to Carthage than it is Rome and seeing as they were the larger naval power during the Punic wars, this would've given them a major advantage. Imagine, if Carthage had won, all of Western history would be different."

Also, Sicily and Sardinia are separate, colors on the original were confusing.  Edit: Most of the countries are self-explanatory. There are some small German states in Eastern Europe. Danube Swabians, Hlinsko Germans, etc. I didn't set up any for Germans in Transylvania, there was one, but it was absorbed by Hungary. Ah, it was when Hungary gained Szelkerland and Hungarian Transylvania, and lost Sopron and the Danube Swabians. Maybe I'll bring it back. Any other suggestions would also be nice. Please remember the WWI era demographics, like an Albanian Sandzak.  I've been told to add Limburg to Flanders.  Edit: Come to think of it, the Saarland wouldn't exist if Germany won WWI would it? Where would it be?  Edit: So, I'm going to do some major work on this tomorrow. Add in some Frisia, Abkhazia, and Ossetia. Saarland will be annexed by the Rhineland.

The ascension of the House Thrune to the Chelish throne in 4640 AR cemented Westcrown's fate, as the capital was moved north to Egorian; no longer the City of Nine Stars, Westcrown now became the ""City of Twilight.""

imaginarymaps,34mxek,SuperStalin,5,Sun May 3 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"13th Age is a d20 fantasy tabletop role-playing game, designed by Rob Heinsoo (lead designer of D&D 4e)  and Jonathan Tweet (lead designer of D&D 3e), and published by Pelgrane Press.  The setting of 13th Age is intended to be fleshed out in the course of play. Although there are default places, 13 default Icons that are archetypes of powerful Gods and NPCs in standard Fantasy settings, and a default monster manual, a lot of the setting is dependent on character creation. This is done by means of having freeform backgrounds rather than predefined skills, and by each character having One Unique Thing that can be anything which has no direct mechanics; examples in the rulebook include I am the only halfling knight of the Dragon Emperor and I have a clockwork heart made by the dwarves, both of which have an impact on both character and the entire setting"

A democratic society created in the aftermath of the Awakening and the rise of the corporate state, the UCAS government drew heavily upon the American Constitution when forming the new UCAS Constitution. Though several key changes were made, the governmental structures are very similar to those which ruled throughout the USA prior to the formation of the UCAS.  As a signatory of the Business Recognition Accords, the UCAS recognizes extra-territoriality of AA and AAA megacorporations. The UCAS constitution also recognizes contract law, particularly in the area of employment contracts. Because of the contractual obligations of an employee to his employer, UCAS law recognizes the right of the employer to pursue legal action through a properly designated legal body. UCAS law treats extraterritorial corporations in a similar manner to foreign powers, signing extradition agreements and formal trade agreements. A social implication of the changes to contract law was the secularization of marriage, allowing the formation of contractual obligations in marriage and setting terms for dissolution of the contract."

imaginarymaps,33pf5h,metastasis_d,10,Fri Apr 24 23:32:33 2015 UTC,It's located under Lake Victoria and has excellent transfiguration courses.
imaginarymaps,33pf5h,Felderburg,9,Sat Apr 25 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Aren't muggle borders reasonably similar? Or is it just in the UK the two work closely together, since it's an island?"
imaginarymaps,33pf5h,01hair,46,Fri Apr 24 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"According to JK Rowling, there are about 1000 students at Hogwarts. In 1997 (when the first book came out), the population of the UK and Ireland was 63 million people, meaning that the Hogwarts students made up 0.00159% of the population of its region.  For a minute, let's assume that life expectancy for witches/wizards is uniform worldwide, and the ratio of wizards/witches to muggles is also uniform worldwide.  This means that of India's 900 million people (in 1997), over 14,000 attend whatever school covers India. If there is no separate school for India and China (1.23 billion people in 1997), almost 40,000 students are attending a Mahoutokoro School of Magic from just India and China.  For just Russia, the number is about 2,300 students (from only Russia). I assume that the entire Koldovstoretz school was brought to Hogwarts in Goblet of Fire, which wasn't anywhere near 2,000 students. It would seem that the British Isles have a much higher proportion of wizards/witches to muggles than other parts of the world. Why would that be?"
imaginarymaps,33pf5h,JerusalemArtichoke,52,Fri Apr 24 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation, here - my early impression from the books was that witches and wizards outside of the authority of the UK Ministry of Magic would have different systems; these would be perhaps less formal (go three villages away to the teacher witch), passed down from parent to child, or simply small regional academies. Metropolises (eg, Beijing, Bangalore, etc) might have their own school, similar to a muggle regional university.  Everyone's heard of say, Harvard ... or Hogwarts ... but can you name the best secondary school in Buenos Aires?"
imaginarymaps,33pf5h,01hair,35,Fri Apr 24 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"Excellent point. I suppose that the schools mentioned are the ""Ivy League"" of magic schools.

Britain and much of Europe, being influenced by their latin history, uses magic words and wands to control magic. But other parts of the world might have a more spiritual approach to magic, for example, or have druidism or have different rituals to manipulate magic. They might concentrate more on potions or magical creatures, etc. So there might not necessarily be other schools exactly like hogwarts in Asia and Africa."

Germany was again in the right, along with England, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, etc. As soon as the war closed, communists and like minded nations attacked. Again, the monarchists won. Shortly afterwards, Germany broke up, and former fascist countries, like Denmark, France, Greece, Poland, etc, regained independence. Eventually, Germany reunited, and an incident in Skopje started WW4. The Germans were finally defeated. A UN like organization was formed, and nationalist tendencies rose. The organization gave nearly all peoples their own country. There's more on my work computer, like the Austo-Swiss War and other small conflicts. Two compromise countries were also established. The Azov region, and the Marmara region, which could be sufficiently ethnically divided. The Bulgarian territories in the Budjak and Taraclia were a compromise nation, but were eventually annexed with some parts going to Romania and Ukraine."

Countries that lost land: Turkey, Iran, Yemen, and Pakistan,  Countries that gained land: Jordan, Israel*, and Azerbaijan  Countries that stayed the same: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Lebanon  New countries: Kurdistan, Alawite Republic, Zaidi Republic, Sunni Arab Syria, Shia Arab Iraq (not actual names of these 2 new countries), Northern Afghan Confederation, Pashtunistan, Balochistan, and Sindhistan.     Syria is now a mostly Sunni Arab nation with the Alawites on the west coast breaking away. Iraq is now mostly Shia Arab and free from the sectarian divides that have doomed it from it's birth.   Jordan now has Palestine incorporated into it's lands as a semi autonomous entity, which relieves some of Israel's tensions with a respected and somewhat trusted ally taking care of the security concerns of Palestine while allowing for Palestine to have more autonomy and self rule. Israel itself gains the Golan Heights as more or less a buffer zone with it's neighbors.   Lebanon is now a confederation. The Sunnis, Shias, Christians, and Jews now all now have legally recognized greater autonomy, rather than them abandoning the rule of law in order to have better representation for their group. They would more or less be the Swiss of the Middle East.       Kurdistan forms out of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, now becoming a major stable western ally and force in the region. Azerbijan also incorporates their ethnic lands in Iran, thus increasing their presence in the region. Also in the south the Shia Zaidi break away from Yemen and form their own nation based out of Sana'a, and the Sunni Arab Yemenis base their new nation out of Aden on the coast of the Gulf of Aden.   The Pashtuns will no longer be able to force the people's of Afghanistan and Pakistan to follow their governments, and this new nation would have the bulk of terrorist activity in this region, so there would only have to be one major terrorism policy by the west rather than two for this region. What is left of Afghanistan becomes a confederation in the north and is added to Balochistan in the south, which is mostly made up of former Pakistani lands. Now that Pakistan is free of the Pashtuns and other groups they should have some level of greater cohesion, they also get the Muslim dominated parts of Kashmir, and not the Hindu and Buddhist dominated areas of the territory. Lastly in the south Karachi becomes the new capital of Sindhistan.  The map without words"
imaginarymaps,33hc9a,superfahd,11,Wed Apr 22 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"FYI, Sindh would most likely call itself Sindh if it ever broke away. Also, a territorially weakened Pakistan would become a ripe target for India, so I can't imagine it would stay stable for long"

Believe me my friend I am on the same side as you. My idea here is that the only way we will get a free Palestine is if Israel can trust it's neighbors, and it somewhat trusts Jordan. So my idea is to have both Gaza and the West bank be incorporated into Jordan as part of a transition phase into statehood! But yeah if you look really close you can see that Gaza and the West bank are sticking together as it should be! :)"
imaginarymaps,33hc9a,hablomuchoingles,4,Wed Apr 22 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"From an Israeli perspective, your solution would be very welcome. As you say, it would end Israel's burden of occupying the West Bank while taking care of the security concerns since Jordan is a trusted ally. IRL this has been offered by Israel to Jordan, but they aren't interested because it creates more problems for Jordan. Jordan is already a majority Palestinian country, but it is ruled by Hashemites from the Arabian peninsula. They fought a civil war in the 70's because of this, with the Hashemite monarchy remaining in power. So the last thing Jordan would want is even more Palestinians."

Why not just split them up via annexation. The exception is Nuristan, Hazara and the Aimaks, as well as the Tajiks around Herat who could not be attached to Tajikistan.    The Balochis would obviously take the Balochi area of Iran, and the Arab areas of Iran may revolt if the region is destabilized.

imaginarymaps,33hc9a,Fummy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this but I decided to keep it as is because the distribution of those ethnic populations is a bit wack in the north and those tribes in the north would be greatly unaccustomed to being incorporated into a strong state.

Since Russia was blocked and Mongols busy North, China expanded North, taking the East of Siberia and forming the west east Asian Union.  Since Russia didn't go East, he thinks that China wouldn't get into Alaska and as such, didn't sell it to the USA and instead, Canada took Alaska (and became the #1 Country in size)."

One question- I recently spent quite a bit of time in SW Louisiana- technically part of the Houston Council- but from the people I talked with down there they seem to be much more of the Bayou Commune type- a mixture of deep south Croc hunters with a bit of old french mixed in. What about the Houston Council pulled them away?"

The BC was a compromise between the SU and RoT/HC on how to split Louisiana as the former had just lost a significant battle against the MAC/RS/NR coalition while the latter was worried about Arizona's march across New Mexico. The terms were set that so most of the swamplands are contained in the BC but, at the point of time this map is set, the RoT's resources are being stretched from conflicts across the Arizona border and keeping order in their part of Louisiana. In my current campaign, RoT intelligence has suggested that those giving them grief in the Bayou area are being funded by the SU.

Chicago is a massive city (3rd largest by pop and city-GDP in the US) whose metro area extends somewhat into Wisconsin in the real world. Since it seems to be the capital and dominant city of the PRotG, I'd expect it to have dominated southeastern Wisconsin most of the way to Milwaukee, possibly including that city. If these states are inclined to fight one another, a country with Chicago as its capital would be very regionally powerful and would have the means to make sure another nation didn't have a border running that close to the current city border.  Indianapolis is also kinda weird because it's the only large city for 100+ miles, but right now its metro area is basically sitting across a three corners border. You'd think that one of those three countries would have taken the city entirely, whether by peace or by force. It's just the hub for most of Indiana and it's weird to see an economic/cultural bloc split so neatly in three."
imaginarymaps,32mdlq,tagehring,2,Wed Apr 15 00:41:23 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you brought it up and backed up your criticism with a constructive argument.   Chicago is right by every account. The GLU claimed Michigan and Wisconsin by the pre-Schism borders (excluding the Toledo strip). Chicago was, at the time, the center for a proto-PRG government called the Garden Republic. The Garden Republic administration was ousted after a failed campaign against the Riverlands which lead to the loss of Southern Illinois. A new government, formed under a woman named Theodora Green, was proclaimed in Springfield. For a few months there was significant infighting, during which time the Springfield government signed a treaty with the Riverlands which ceded territories including Springfield itself (marked as a pink star). Eventually, the Springfield administration won out and Green was sworn in as the first President of the PRG.   While I didn't intend for it to be this way, I suppose Indianapolis could just be a city near the border but the way you word it has me thinking I could look at it again. The map was not made with Indianapolis as a major variable, I'm afraid."
imaginarymaps,32mdlq,ZeusforPres,2,Wed Apr 15 01:00:33 2015 UTC,"That's a believable backstory for Chicago, then.

The only portions you might get would be a stretch of land from the AZ/CA border into Maricopa County (which is where the majority of the Snowbirds and California immigrants end up). Most of the rest of AZ thinks CA is a commie-state and wishes it would do us all the favor of dropping into the ocean.

It's directly haveway between them along the Main highways.  It in what would be Former Ohio but has more people who are loyal to Pit than Cle.  When Ohio was founded it had a similar compromise that made Central, But very small at the time, Columbus the Capital Rather than Cle or Cinci, who were major cities at opposite ends of the State."

Unlike a few other of these states, I don't have specific conferences or conventions declaring Pittsburgh as the capital. I chose it as capital for pragmatic reasons - both because of its defensive position (west of the Appalachians/far enough east) and its centrality.  No one in my group's done a RS-oriented campaign, though, so it's a region that doesn't have much depth."

Many factory owners in the area were proponents of the Mountain War which earned them territory in West Virginia where many of their mining operations have taken root.  Pittsburgh, as the capital, is home to many political offices and non-profits but also a burgeoning tech industry. The city has annexed more of the surrounding towns as it has grown larger.

There's not really a New York, even if that's where most of their holdings are.  As for why they have territory in VA has to do with the advance of the SU against MAC/RS forces. The SU had been the regional hegemony for nearly a decade up to this point and, aside for Florida, had very few friends abroad. The New Republic saw this advance as an opportunity to seize the Norfolk Naval Base so they aligned with MAC and the River States (RS) to push back the offense. In return for their assistance, NR took Norfolk and the surrounding wetlands as a buffer. MAC and RS took parts of Virginia."

imaginarymaps,31w2ix,ArkitekZero,36,Wed Apr 8 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"So I tried to make a more realistic wizarding world for Harry Potter a while ago, basically I got annoyed that every nation on earth has a ""Ministry of Magic"" the exact same as Britain's, practicing the exact same sort of Latin based wand magic, with the wizards apparently being willfully ignorant of the Muggle world for centuries but also keeping up to date on political changes enough that Burkina Faso has its own ministry of magic...oh and also everyone claiming that wizards don't understand muggle technology when I've seen three magical cars, a bus, a motorbike, and a steam train, and everyone is completely cool with it.    Reality warping magical powers I can handle, but if you try to fucking my politics and anthropology I get mad!  So this is the magical world.  Magic is a force that affects energy, matter, space and time.  It's affected evolution since the dawn of time, hence magical creatures are just animals that evolved a way to use magic, like making your wings grow larger so a horse can fly, or conjuring up fire or whatever.  Some humans can do it too, and these are the wizards and witches.  For them magic is a force that without training is very difficult to use and is often used accidentally in times of distress or excitement, a young child has to be taught how to focus and learn to manipulate magical forces so as not to put themselves or anyone else in danger.  Magic from country to country is based off of culture and religion mostly, so western Europe (I was unsure what to do with Spain) is mostly Latin based spells and wand waving stemming from the ""Roman"" tradition (mostly derived from ancient Middle Eastern magic anyway), whereas Scandinavian and Eastern European (and to a lesser extent Celtic and Hellenic/Balkan) magic is based off of local languages and mythologies and has more to do with the study of nature spirits, communication with the dead and predicting the future than wand waving.  They do practice western style wand magic of course, but a traditional education would see it as stupid and flashy.  Though wands are pretty universal in the western world magicians in Asia and Africa still tend to look down on them, preferring to use drug-induced trances or meditation to focus their magical abilities as their ancestors had done for millennia, which has its benefits and disadvantages.  A Tibetan or Thai wizard may take decades to be declared ""fully trained"" but they more than earn the title of master, super fast wordless spells are more effective than pointing and yelling.  Meanwhile African witch-doctors are more skilled with potions than their European counterparts, and generally don't have to hide from their communities, however their spells are more unpredictable, hands and fetish adorned staffs aren't as good conductors as a magic wand.  A few little history lessons.  Wizards do not do well under extreme political situations.  A dictatorship which insists on knowing what its citizens are up too at all times and sees any unusual behaviour as anti-state is something that they really cannot handle.  So when the Reds came a calling during the Russian Revolution the wizarding population of Eastern Europe were not too happy.  Those with the money fled abroad, whilst the majority have managed to hide out in Siberia, the abandoned towns, or even in magically concealed underground homes in the Odessa catacombs.  Russian wizards have no organised government, though since the fall of the USSR many westernized Russian wizards (the descendants of nobles mostly) are moving back, trying to reassert their dominance over their more anarchistic kinsmen.        Gellert Grindelwald was a German-Hungarian wizard and in the 1940's he was to the wizarding world what Hitler and Stalin were to the west.  An extremely powerful and charismatic leader with sociopathic tendencies and an army of followers who were determined to help him change the world.  His goal was to get all wizards marching behind the same banner so they could reveal themselves to the Muggles and bring them under their protection as benevolent masters, with Gellert himself as the most benevolentness!  Things didn't go to plan however, his war (fought between 1939 and 1945) led to the murder of hundreds of Eastern and Central European wizards who opposed his plans and Grindelwald allying himself with certain elements of the German government who found his very old school magical style just what they were interested in.  More than a few victims of the Final Solution found themselves tied to a stone slab adorned with runes and an acolyte of Grindy chanting in old Norse whilst their throats were cut.  Grindelwalds war cost many lives, but the death blow for many eastern European wizard families was not the at the hands of SS wizards but under the boot heels of the Red army.  Do you honestly think Uncle Joe would let such obvious counterrevolutionaries live?  In the Balkans many wizard families managed to hide out in the mountains as they had done for centuries before, if the KGB couldn't be bothered trawling through the arse-end of Romania just to find one old man and his wife who are ""unusually quiet"".  So this is meant to be like 1993.  Bits of Asia are done but I probably won't finish this for a while, I just wanted to do a write-up.  Note 1: Lots of wizards who supported Grindelwald (not just Germans, also Slavs, Italians and British too, wizards do have nationalism but they care about it a lot less than us) fled to Scandinavia after the war so they wouldn't be imprisoned like their master.  Traditional Germanic/Scandinavian magic was what Grindy had enjoyed practicing anyway, just a more extreme form that had been out of vogue for about 1,000 years...  Now they're making headway in former East Germany where a lot of wizards have suffered under the communist occupation.  They probably won't try anything again... probably.  Note 2:  Whilst Christians have been terrible at dealing with their respective magical communities for hundreds of years, since the Enlightenment most European wizards have recognized that they can live peacefully so long as they keep a low profile, and aren't living under a murderous dictatorship.  However the wizards of the Middle East (they prefer being called sorcerers)  are still having a hard time 1400 years after Islam first decided that they were filthy heathens and were defying the will of Allah!  Today Oman and Jordan are seen have the largest Arab wizard populations, and most of them practitioners are Muslim of one form or another, though the ones still surviving with their tribes in the deserts of Arabia may identify with the gods of their ancestors just to spite the Saudi's."

imaginarymaps,31w2ix,zakii,8,Wed Apr 8 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"Expecto patronum comes from Latin which means ""I await a guardian"". How neat is that?!"
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,Random832,8,Wed Apr 8 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"It also has the implication that no one could do magic until after the Romans showed up, and that no one but the Europeans could do magic until they were taught the Latin phrases.  Taken from that view Harry Potter is incredibly racist :P"
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,Random832,6,Wed Apr 8 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"What about the possibility that there Celtic words used before the Romans arrived? The idea of magic was pretty prevalent in the British Isles, much like anywhere else. Regardless, the Romans and Celts were all but removed from England by the Angles and Saxons, who probably would have had similar magic practices to the Scandinavians. Then their practices could have merged with the Normans and been given a very strong French influence.  Actually, the use of Latin reminds me of the popularization of Latin during the Renaissance, and again in the 19th century due to rapid industrialization and scientific advancement. While the wizarding world appears to be insulated from scientific trends, they're clearly not from changes in lexicon. They likely could have adopted similar trends if they were discovering new spells, and therefore renamed the old ones to fit the trend. Given your own ideas on the subject, it's not Latin specifically that's vital to casting a spell, but actually focusing the magic on a specific task and giving words to the action. Theoretically, one could cast a spell using English, but it may be distracting as it would feel like normal speech rather than an intense focus on their own magical energy."
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,Random832,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yes the ancient Celts used magic which was based off of their own languages just like everyone else, and in parts of Ireland and Wales some wizards still practice those forms, which generally just involve talking to local fairy clans, appeasing restless ghosts, and settling disagreements with shirtless knife fights.  That theory does sound accurate, it would fit very well into this world too.  Learning another language requires a lot of concentration, the kind of concentration that would be needed to properly focus your attentions on casting your spell properly.  This implies that really powerful wizards are also very good linguists."
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,Random832,3,Thu Apr 9 08:07:18 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. It just suggests that that particular spell was invented by a latin-speaking culture (maybe Romans, maybe scholarly medieval Europeans). Avada Kedavra comes from Aramaic."

What else could you possibly have meant by ""It also has the implication that no one could do magic until after the Romans showed up""? You're not saying that only Europeans can perform magic, but you are saying that the spell Expecto Patronum is problematic for ""implying"" that, and that is what I am disagreeing with."

That was I think supposed to be some sort of Western European Wizard alliance thingy.

imaginarymaps,31w2ix,untipoquenojuega,5,Wed Apr 8 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"Drumstrang in Scandinavia would be the main magic school, which also accepts students from other Eastern European countries since they don't really have schools of their own anymore.  So Germans, Scandinavians, Romanians, Hungarians, probably some Russians too.   However J. K. was never too specific on geography or population numbers, so a lot of canon stuff is being ignored in favour of realism.  For example she says that every magical child will go to a school like Hogwarts or Drumstrang, which means that magical populations are like a few thousand to a country, which is insanely small.  So here not every magical child in a country goes to the big schools, most of them are taught by local magical teachers.  Hogwarts is like the magical Eton.  So most German kids are taught by a local guy or a travelling teacher, like everyone else.  But he's not allowed to teach old school Germanic magic anymore since it's basically outlawed as Dark Arts in the 90's."
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,untipoquenojuega,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"Surely the Americas and Oceania have magic of sorts. I'd imagine the native population would be similar to the African tribes, but what about when the European colonists came over? Maybe a settlement similar to Plymouth where persecuted witches and wizards tried to form their own nation? Or prison camps like Botany Bay but for wizards?  As for the East Asians, it would be cool if they somehow tied their use of magic into their martial arts where it became an extension of themselves rather than a tool.   Cool map, just wish it was bigger and more detailed."
imaginarymaps,31w2ix,LittleHelperRobot,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yes North American magic comes in three varieties.  The Native Americans who perform for shamanistic stuff with their own languages, they likely trust European wizards about as much as their muggle counterparts trust each other.  Then there are the original colonial families, the ones which escaped persecution and execution in the 17th century and have been hiding out in the backwoods.  Finally you have the mass immigration movements of the past 200 years, Jewish wizards, Irish, Chinese, Polish, German, Russian, Indian etc etc.  They would mostly live amongst their communities in the big cities blending in with the social degradation and general large population of strange people.  However the magical population of North America, and likewise the European emigre wizard populations would only be small, wizards by and large prefer to stay in their own country where they have a stronger connection to the land rather than risk migrating and being burnt alive.

imaginarymaps,31upoq,_PM-Me-Your-PMs_,3,Wed Apr 8 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"I'm cross-posting this from alternatehistory.com, where it was originally posted. Keep in mind that this scenario, like so many of my others, isn't meant to be an entirely realistic telling of the future, nor is it what I think will happen;  Beginning in 2027 with the onset of the so-called 'Lesser Decession', right-wing, and far-right 'authoritarian nationalism' experienced a major comeback in regions such as Europe and South America. This 'shift' of sorts was prompted by a serious of factors such as ethno-religious violence between increasingly maligned and numerous immigrants and the 'native' populations, the incumbency of leftist/moderate politicians during the early days of the Depression (many of the once sidelined extreme-conservative/nationalist parties argued that it was the 'leftists' and moderate conservatives in the 'establishment' that were to blame for the economic troubles), as well as a surge of patriotism (or jingoism, depending on who you ask) that sprung up amidst a rising level of terrorist attacks in Europe.  Ultimately, groups such as Igazsád in Hungary (a party that broke from Jobbik in the mid-2020's), Front national in France (which returned to its more 'extreme' roots following Le Pen's narrow defeat in 2017), and Golden Dawn in Greece (which, whilst being a little more moderate than it's present incarnation, is still heavily fascist) successfully managed to seize power in their respective countries amidst a wave of rising nationalism in the late-2020's and early-2030's; running mostly on platforms that included third position/protectionist economic policies, extreme nationalism, and independence from international organizations (such as the EU).  This came a cost to the general political freedoms in each of these 'third-wave nationalist' countries as individual parties began to curtail rights such as freedom of assembly, speech, and movement so they could solidify their power bases and stabilize their nations (made more simple due to the fact that they managed to give their citizens a sense of 'security' in the aftermath of the 'Lesser Depression'). Of course, almost all of them retain outward-facing 'elections', however many of these are merely faux ballots or heavily skewed in favour of each country's new nationalistic establishment, with some states (Romania, Serbia, Hungary, and Greece) being pretty heavy handed in their implementation of their 'new orders' (Greece especially so).  In Austria, the 'Freedom Party' (recently radicalised due to the further influx of immigrants, as well as the economic downturn that saw many of the moderates driven from their organization) had successfully seized power in 2030, and whilst they originally built up their base as one of 'populism' and 'direct democracy', the way they have governed is far from 'free' (especially in regards to trampling on the right to free speech, not to mention their complete and utter disregard for immigrants of any generation)."
imaginarymaps,31upoq,omsis,3,Wed Apr 8 14:32:10 2015 UTC,Bravery level: 11/10   is this from a particular thread or a summary of multiple threads from alternatehistory.com ? I'd be very interested to learn about eastern europe in this 'universe'...
imaginarymaps,31upoq,omsis,3,Fri Apr 10 07:11:54 2015 UTC,"My above summary is the only thing that I brought from alternatehistory.com (from it's 'map thread'), however I'm working on expanding most aspects of the universe so I can start compiling it into a proper timeline.  As for Eastern Europe; well, it depends on what you want to know. Currently (in 2035 that is), Europe is pretty much divide between the Cosmopolitans (the name given to nations a part of, or aligned to, the European Union) and the Ressortissants (countries that have broken away from the 'Europsphere' to pursue an independent (nationalist) domestic and foreign policy). Now the de facto heads of these two groups is Germany for the Cosmopolitans (the current Chancellor wishing to form an even stronger union with it's member states) and France/Russia for the Ressortissants (both of which oppose the European Union and the United Nations; the latter position resulting in the infamous 7/7 International Crisis).  Now, in Eastern Europe, Russia maintains a much stronger sphere of influence over nations such as Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania than France (a country far more inclined to involve itself in propping up 'allied' Francophone states in Africa). Domestically, these Ressortissants nations follow pretty similar policies regarding legislation like homosexuality (which has been largely criminalized or maligned), immigration (which has been largely curtailed and discouraged if it is coming from outside Europe), and national identity (for example; in nations like Hungary, Romania, and Serbia, first generation immigrants will not be granted citizenship, and you can only get it if you jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops, as well as speak their 'national languages' fluently). In terms of the strength of the state; most of these Ressortissants nations maintain a stranglehold over their population through dictatorial rule, with only Bulgaria being the only one to maintain at least an atmosphere of democratic governance.  The nations strewn across the Adriatic Coast and the Baltic Sea are far, far more free from such authoritarian nationalism, with most states aligning themselves with the Cosmopolitan European Union (even though two (Croatia and Slovakia) is not officially a part of the EU, having withdrawn in 2029 and 2031 respectively). These nations maintain a much more democratic and open governance than their 'rival' Ressortissant states, although one problem is manifest in pretty much all of their societies; they're all heavily militarized. You see; beginning in 2033, nations like Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania began to seek 'reunification' with their national brothers (Macedonia, Bosnia, and Moldova) after Russia successfully annexed and brought Belarus into the Federation after a (rigged) plebiscite.   This ultimately caused great alarm to spread across these Cosmopolitan states as they fought against the diplomatic attempts by the three nationalistic states to absorb them and began a relatively minor military build up. However, after the 7/7 Crisis that saw most Ressortissant nations withdraw from themselves from the United Nations, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania withdrew their recognition of Macedonia, Bosnia, and Moldova, each agreeing to recognize the 'rights' each nationalistic state had over the three Cosmopolitan nations; an act which in turned spurred an even greater military build up (supported now by Germany) that has resulted in massive tensions in Eastern Europe.  Now; I wanted to talk about Ukraine separately due to the fact that it's a rather 'unique' member of the Europsphere. Having been bitterly torn apart and divided following the 'peace' in the War in Donbass (the break-away states remained independent), Ukraine began to move closer and closer to the EU in fear of further Russian aggression against their nation. Now, this ultimately resulted in Ukraine joining up with the Union following the onset of the economic recovery in the mid-2020's (a time of greater affluence for most nations across the world), however, the events of the 'Lesser Depression' would ultimately tear down this growth almost overnight as the public became increasingly radicalised, particularly after the new Russian President (Konstantin Burmakin) consolidated control over this Federation and began to clamber for political unification with its Ukrainian neighbour.   Now, the Ukrainians, having not forgotten events of 2014-2016, ultimately rejected the Russians approaches, and in 2030, amidst a massive 31% unemployment rate (one of the highest in the world) and political collapse, the Right Sector (in an alliance with Svoboda) successfully seized power with the support of the military and public, and their semi-successful attempts to turn around the miserable economic ultimately brought about a sort of endearment from the people that allowed them to consolidate their new-found strength and eliminate much of their opposition. However, despite being highly nationalistic, as well as maintaining the hope that Ukraine could one day break free from the Eurosphere, they maintain full membership with the Union, as well as 'cordial' relations with Germany in the hopes that EU support will drive off attempts by Russia to march into the nation and annex it like they did in Belarus, all whilst Germany in turn backs the ultra-nationalists (to heavy domestic criticism) simply as a means to stop the further expansion of the Ressortissant nations.  Here's a map that'll hopefully get across what I've been saying; yellow is the Ressortissant states, light blue are those nations aligned to the EU (the Cosmopolitans), whilst the Dark Blue is the European Union itself. If the nation is striped, it means it maintains the influence of either either the Ressortissant or Cosmopolitans, but is 'officially' on one side or the other (or 'neutral' like Greece, Hungary, and Spain)."

The events leading up to Norway's decision to join the EU must have been interesting, it being a very strong economy and gaining a lot of benefits from the EU while technically not being in the EU....  Changes within the UK don't seem that surprising until you realise that they are the opposite of what one might have expected - England not being in the EU and Scotland having joined. Also, Wales and Northern Ireland being in the EU. Does that mean that these countries have joined the EU on their own (with Wales and Northern Ireland not being very self-sufficient economically...) or have they formed some sort of a union?"
imaginarymaps,31upoq,General_Ney,2,Fri Apr 10 10:47:50 2015 UTC,"Oops, forget Norway being a part of the EU; I forgot to turn it back to light blue when I was editing.  As for the UK; well, the United Kingdom is an interesting case. Imagine the UK of 2035 in a state of 'max-devolution'; including strong local government for Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, with the power of represent themselves abroad in a number of select cases, as well as exemptions from some of the overarching laws set by the Union Parliament. Of course, they're all still technically a part of the United Kingdom (they're not de jure independent), but over the course of the 2020's they slowly managed to wrangle power away from London and ensure maximum local governance; the affluence of the decade giving citizens of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, self-confidence in their power to stand 'on their own' without overarching economic support from London. And then the 'Lesser Depression' hit.  Amidst the rampant chaos and general insanity that struck the UK in the aftermath of this new Depression, populist nationalism exploded across the nation in the form of politicians and parties that follow an ideology similar to today's UKIP, or at worst, the BNP. Of course, UKIP itself had been in parliament for over a decade at this point, however it never achieved the power that it always desired, nor did it managed to convince enough citizens that withdrawal from the EU would be worth the risks, especially within the onset of the 2020's 'era of affluence'. However, when the banks burst in 2027 and the UK's slowly growing economy collapsed in on itself, Euroscepticism once again jumped up in popularity and in the 2028 elections (they were held earlier due to the collapse of confidence with regards to the ruling Labour Party), UKIP successfully swept into second position in terms of seats in the HOR, enough to ensure supply-and-demand for the minority conservative government; and their first demand was the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  This was a demand that wasn't taken lightly in any of the devolved regions of the country (Northern Ireland, Scotland, or Wales); their local governments believing that if they remained tied to London if it withdrew from the EU, they'd lose most of the benefits that came with political and economic ties to the continent (primarily Germany). As a result, political pressure from these three devolved governments ultimately managed to pressure the conservative government (as well as petition the EU itself) to grant the people of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, the right to decide whether they too should withdraw from the Union, or remain within it, this time as separate entities.  Following a vote held in late-2033, the three autonomous regions within the UK ultimately voted to remain within the European Union (or rather, rejoin under seperate representations), all whilst the English regions of the UK decided to withdraw from the EU after a remarkably close referendum. Over the following year 2034), political and economic ties were either dissolved or renewed, and on the first day of 2035, the countless numbers of documents regarding the UK's 'withdrawal' from the Union (and the ascension of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland) came into effect."

Ultimately, the Catalonians voted to split from Spain with a vote of 83.8% in 2030 and whilst the central government begrudgingly agreed to the divorce early on, following the fall of the monarchy in 2032 and the rise of the 'authoritarian' Demócratas Nacionales party, Madrid has been attempting to reabsorb the region back into their newly formed republic; a move that has contributed to the infamous '7/7 International Crisis'.  In Belarus on the other hand; their intergeneration within the Russian Federation really began under one man; Konstantin Burmakin. President since 2024 (following the fall of a short-lived Communist-led government), Burmakin was staunch 'authoritarian nationalist' who sought to unify the extant peoples who he considered to be Russians (Belarussians, Ukrainians, ect.). This began in the late-2020's amidst the lesser depression after the fall of the Lukashenko government in Minsk that ultimately led to Russian military intervention to help calm the almost-anarchical situation. Shortly afterwards, Burmakin began pressuring the new provisional government to become more closely aligned to Russia, and whilst there was major push back by republicans in Belarus as well as the international community, the pressure applied by the Russian President ultimately led to a (rigged) referendum being held in 2032 that ultimately saw Belarus ascend to the Federation as an 'autonomous republic'."

imaginarymaps,31upoq,That_Guy381,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly, that's not an independent ISIS state in northern Iraq; it's a separate Sunni state that separated itself from the Shia-majority south following a semi-successful UN peacekeeping mission in 2018 that followed in the wake of the fall of the Islamic State. This 'North Iraq' (officially called the Jazirah Republic; named after the al-Jazira plains in upper Mesopotamia) was ultimately recognized by most nations around the world in the early-2020's (similarly to the Federal Republic of Kurdistan) as 'peace' slowly began to return to the region. Problems persisted in Jazirah however (primarily suicide bombings and sectarian riots), and without the economic support that would help rebuild the majority of South Iraq and Kurdistan by the late-2020's, this new nation wasn't ready for the complete collapse of the world economy brought about by the 'Lesser Depression' that began in 2027. As a result, a military led a coup in 2028 seized power under the guise of assuming control from ""corrupt and unworthy politicians in the capital"" (Tikrit), and ever since then Jazirah has been led by a cadre of officers that are aligning their nation closer to 'independent powers' such as Russia and France, all whilst brutally suppressing any forms of dissent (religious, political, or otherwise)."

As the name implies, it was an economic downturn that had similar features to the 'Great Depression' of the 1930's (for example; the US unemployment rate reaches 21% during 2030), this including the political effects that followed in the wake of the economic hardships. Primarily, rampant authoritarian nationalism/conservatism flourished in the difficult conditions brought about by the market collapse of 2027, and after winning several elections in their respective nations in the ensuring years, parties like the Freedom Party (in Austria), Golden Dawn (in Greece), and the National Front (in France) ultimately began to push more and more nationalistic, authoritarian measures on their populations. Unfortunately, by 2035, most of southern Europe has been caught up in what is called 'Third Wave Nationalism'; the ideology including aspects of protectionism, anti-globalization, anti-immigration, and extreme nationalism (not-so dissimilar from the fascism of Franco's Spain, or Mussolini's Italy), all of which has ultimately led to these nations falling down 'freedom scales'.  Similarly; this wave of far-right, authoritarian nationalism ultimately gained a foothold in Latin America and South Korea; the administrations of those nations instituting several reforms that mirror those of southern Europe (Brazil being particularly radical in its 'new-found' radical nationalism). Meanwhile, in the remainder of the developing world, economic hardships have ultimately seen generally authoritarian military coups become prevalent again despite the 'stabilization' of region such as Africa and south-east Asia during the 2020's, and whilst some other parts of the world have seen democracy flourish during this difficult times (particularly West Africa), most of the 'third world' has fallen back into chaos, despite the best attempts of 'market-inclined' nations such as China to prop up their administrations."

imaginarymaps,31e5sw,ddawg82,4,Sun Apr 5 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"Curious to the logic on why Guangdong province would fall under ""Union of Formosa"". Culturally, Fujian is closer to Taiwan than Guangdong. For starters, Fujian speak a dialect of Min, which is what Taiwanese is based from, as opposed to Cantonese, which is spoken in Guangdong.  Either way, even if China was to collapse, I'm not sure if Taiwan is really poised to exert control over parts of the mainland. If anything, Hong Kong would probably look to reclaim its independence if not renew ties with the UK."
imaginarymaps,31e5sw,Eveco,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"Well,Taiwan has a strong military(kind of),and it'll probably come to Hong Kong's aid if the central government collapsed.I live in Hong Kong myself,so I can tell most people in the pearl river delta speak cantonese,so they share a similar cultural background.Furthermore,Hong Kong is currently using a capitalist system economy(similar to taiwan's) and doesn't have the resources to run itself(Water supplies,power etc),so it needs the neighbouring territories to sustain itself."
imaginarymaps,31e5sw,lucidsleeper,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:53:09 2015 UTC,"Taiwan has its own military but it's more for self-defence. Even so, it still needs help from the United States should there be any armed conflict with mainland China.  As for the tie between Hong Kong and Taiwan, while their economic and political growth in the last 60 years have been similar, they're still culturally very different. They don't speak the same language/dialact (Wu/Cantonese vs Min/Taiwanese). Aside from the mainland refugees from 1949, most of the non-Aboriginal Taiwanese residents are from the Fujian province, not Guangdong. Cities like Xiamen seem more similar to Taiwanese cities than Hong Kong.  Given Hong Kong's historical tie to the UK, if China was to collapse, both HK residents and the West would probably use that as a rationale to establish order (or even control) in the area, especially given the heavy investments of the West in Hong Kong's financial markets.  Additionally, should the central government of China truly collapse, you may see additional fragmentation within provinces. For example, Sichuan and Qinghai may face additional pressure given the high concentration of Tibetan, Uyghur, Yi, and Hui minorities. Southwest Yunnan has been getting dragged into conflicts from Myammar. Without a central government, you may see it continuing to spill over. Russia may also use that opportunity to seize more land (as it did years ago with parts of Siberia), taking control of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia.  Of course, this is all subject to how a supposed collapse would occur. Would it be economic? Is it a military coup?"

People’s Republic of Africa: As the consortium started to take hold over Africa, many nationalist and communist forces rose up to oppose the control of their countries and through warfare. They established a socialist state in lands where consortium mercenaries were fought off.  Northern African Prosperity Company: A similar corporate country fueled by economic and political refugees from the break-up of America, along with opportunistic businesses from Europe.  Ethiopia: Fearing that their country would soon be subject to radical Islamic attacks, the E.U. along with Ethiopian forces launched a preemptive attack into the two latter countries. They also occupied Djibouti, granting it autonomous rule along with northern Somalia, while Eritrea and southern Somalia are held under military occupation. The entire area is under large military and economic assistance from the E.U..  Berber Confederacy: Inspired by the Arab Republic and fearful of corporate advances, many North African states decided to form a collective alliance to maintain their sovereignty."
imaginarymaps,30zs19,reverb_kitty,5,Wed Apr 1 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"The United States of America: Following a massive corruption exposure within the U.S. government and a series of devastating financial system failures, America was subject to widespread unrest and disillusion. Vast sections of America were unofficially abandoned by the government, relocating to the East Coast. Only taking a fraction of its military with it. All U.S. Pacific and Caribbean possessions were peacefully transferred to England or Japan. Alaska sought peaceful protectorate status from Russia. Minnesotan Imperium: Soon following the failure of the U.S. government, National Guardsmen and a large portion of rural and immigrant private citizens from Minnesota formed an alliance to restore order to the state. They soon established control and advanced into the Dakotas to seize military equipment and agricultural resources. They afterwards started and military and diplomatic advance across the mid-west and southern Canada, defeating warlords or absorbing provisional governments as they went. They soon established total control of the Great Lakes region Joint Occupation Zone: As Minnesotan forces moved eastward, they encountered the still functioning U.S. government. Rather than engage in warfare, they agreed to set up a joint economic and military assistance zone located in Middle America in which each entity would assist their assigned areas through large military complexes.  California: Following the American collapse, the state of California set up its own republican government, absorbing parts of Nevada. It pursues an isolationist policy, save for its formal friendship pact with the North West Republic.  North West Republic: After the downfall of the U.S. government, the states of Oregon, Washington and parts of British Columbia formed the North West Republic. It maintains a friendship treaty with California. It also governs the city states of Edmonton and Calgary. Mexico: After America fell, massive unrest and violence north of Mexico’s border prompted an intervention by Mexico and supported by left over military units of The U.S. Army. They soon established a protection zone San Diego through Texas. In response to the occupation, numerous White Power and nationalist groups along with other disgruntled factions rose up throughout the American South, causing violence and disorder, prompting further Mexican intervention through Florida.  Unorganized Territory: As the U.S. government collapsed and new nations formed, much of America was left without any effective government and now survives on a day to day basis either under the power of basic provisional governments or warlords.  Southern Warlords: What remained of the rebel or white power factions after the Mexican intervention set up small states in the deep south that are constantly at war with each other. Denver was seized by a powerful warlord who organized it into an effective military machine, making vassals of much of the surrounding area. Kansas Republic: Soon after the governmental collapse, the Kansas state government established itself as a small, but functional agrarian state. This changed after the violent rise of the Denver warlord who wreaked havoc upon them and now takes sizable tribute payments in return for peace and relative independence.  Quebec: When America fell, the massive disorder took Canada with it. A new, organized government in Montreal supported financially by the E.U. was formed and established itself in the eastern portion of the country."

imaginarymaps,30zs19,grisioco,3,Thu Apr 2 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"Greater China: As America collapsed and its export markets dried up, China sought expansion into western Asia as solution to its economic woes. The numerous but weak Central Asian nations could do little as well trained Chinese soldiers stormed through their lands until Chinese holdings reached the Caspian Sea. The idea worked as without a major rival and numerous new natural resources, China’s economy was revitalized and expanded. The areas under Chinese control were not formally integrated into the country. Satellite communist party governments were set up and all aspects of government are controlled by Beijing.  Central Asian Confederacy: As China battled for supremacy in central Asia, dissident groups within Tibet, Western China and the other central Asian countries not yet invaded launched a devastating surprise insurgency campaign in Southwestern China, driving out their rule and seizing military equipment as the bulk of Chinese forces were stationed in Mongolia and Kazakhstan. To prevent further Chinese aggression, the involved nations set up a defensive and economic pact in which each state is autonomous. China did not want to expand the already endemic guerilla warfare in its territory and left the new nation alone.  ASEAN: The organization began as a simple trade treaty between nations but its members soon agreed upon political and military alliances once major acts of Chinese aggression started. To gain buffer space from China, they collectively attacked and toppled Burma’s military regime. Events continued on until roughly one year after the establishment of the Central Asian Confederacy, when China started supporting numerous “liberation movements in northern Burma, Laos and Vietnam). Many of these guerilla units were entirely Chinese volunteers who infiltrated coalition territory as the Chinsese wished to shift their influence southward. The coalition has stepped up full scale attacks against pro Chinese forces in order to retain their political and economic independence. While open war has not yet occurred, it seems highly likely and ASEAN has made alliances now with Taiwan, Japan and Korea. Korea (second Dark Brown): Prior to American collapse, South Korean and American forces finally decided to remove the leaders of North Korea from power through a preemptive invasion. The country is now united and many American service men are now Korean or Japanese citizens as there is no realistic way they can return home."
imaginarymaps,30zs19,jPaolo,3,Wed Apr 1 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:  I think that the Arab Republic is very unlikely. A lot of the Middle Eastern countries aren't on great relations with each other, and I doubt countries like Saudi Arabia which are pretty rich from all the oil they have, would like to join with Yemen, a poor and unstable region.   I don't think the Islamic State is powerful enough to take over to much land. How powerful they exactly are is not well known, but them moving from Iraq and Syria to NE Africa and taking over Egypt, Libya and Sudan would not be possible.  Berber Confederacy has the same problems as the Arab Republic. Countries don't like each other enough and the rich countries wouldn't want to join the poor countries.  Oh and you managed to group the whole of Africa into six countries. That's fucking ridiculous. Africa is massive and full of different cultures. I think a more realistic prediction would see Africa split up into more countries because in a lot of the poorer regions have a lot of ethnic divisions that can become violent. If these ethnic groups are free to govern their own countries there will be more stability within Africa.   As much as it would be good if Kurdistan is a country, I don't see why the Arab Republic made it one. Why would it be in their interests?  And if North Korea was invaded, there would be a pretty massive backlash from China, seeing as they are allied, and China has nukes and I don't think SK and Japan would be willing to take the risk.  The Victoria II provinces are already defined by geography and history, so unless you know a lot about where you are drawing the borders, it might be better is you just followed those.  I don't think Venezuela has the military or economy to go around invading South America.  ASEAN is no where near ready for unification. Maybe in a few decades down the line, but can't see it happening any time soon.  Since most of the world relies on the US somehow, big changes would happen, and it would set the world back a bit. Not too much but no country could afford to start unifying the countries around them.  And last but not least, China can invade a fuck load of Mongolia and East Russia, but doesn't even touch Taiwan? Right. Sure.  Edit: I do however respect the work you've put into it. It's quite detailed, just a little unbelievable. I came across as a bit more angry than I meant to :D"
imaginarymaps,30zs19,jPaolo,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:32:55 2015 UTC,"the arab republic and kurdistan works around the idea that ISIS gets so bad that it unifies the arabs and Kurdish help so far in the war has been massive. Now the idea is that Africans aren't running any of corporate nations, theyre run by the refugee moguls, businessmen and arms merchants. it kind of works off the bread and circuses concept, while any disorder is quietly and violently taken care by their shady private security and the communist nation of Africa also is a reactionary nation, held together by an opposition to the corporate states same with the berbers. the idea behind Taiwan staying independent is that even though the US is gone, all their military in the region remains and is absorbed into the Asian countires theyre stationed in. also china has condemned north korea before even if they are allies. if the conditions were right, china would let an invasion of north korea slide. large isis territory is explained that they merged with boko haram and al shabaab.   most of map is based on reactionary outcomes to a new world order of sorts. crazy things have happened in response to radical changes in order before in history, so it could happen again. that's the basis for most outlandish countries. btw, I followed borders very closely where are you taking issue?"

imaginarymaps,30g7w8,scottastic,8,Fri Mar 27 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, without the ice cap, Antarctica would be weighed down less, and so more of it would be above sea level than in your map. So more like OP's map."
imaginarymaps,30g7w8,Cosmologicon,19,Fri Mar 27 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it would take a long time for it to all rebound.

Technically both views are correct, just in different time frames."
imaginarymaps,30g7w8,boringdude00,3,Fri Mar 27 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"But antarctica would never look like the map of the bedrock underneath the ice today anyway. When it would start to melt, the ground would start to move (already does actually), and when it melts faster it will move faster. So, a simulation of what it would look like after the rebound is over isn't really worse than the bedrock map. You can't really be more ""correct"" without assuming a specific scenario of how you melt the ice, and model it for a specific time, which is probably harder to do and less accurate anyway."

imaginarymaps,30g7w8,argh523,2,Fri Mar 27 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's not that difficult to construct a reasonably accurate map that would take into account the proper shape of the underlying bedrock and the greening aspects of OPs highly inaccurate map.  The key factor would be how many years in the future you want to set it and the level of erosion due to water flow that would happen.  Isostatic rebound is slow, even in the initial stages when it happens ""quickly"", it's still hundreds of years for a few feet of elevation.  At present the Canadian Shield is still rising, 12-18,000 years after the 3-4km deep continental glaciers left.  The current rate on the northern side edge of the Great Lakes is about 1inch per century.  The geographic map is a far more accurate representation of what an ice free Antarctic would look like for at least a few hundred, if not a thousand years after the ice melts.  Need some. New erosional features though."

imaginarymaps,307sr5,Cdresden,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your style, your competency with drawing and what hardware you have. I myself, enjoy drawing a lot (though I must confess I'm only competent at drawing a select few things at the moment, I'm no artist at all) and I like doing stuff from scratch. My favourite aspect of world building is playing around with basic designs in the early stages.   Because of this I own a graphic tablet and use a mix of Gimp, Krita and Black Ink.  for any drawing I do in general, not just maps, I use GIMP or Krita to do the basic outlines, features and most of the colouring. I refine the colours and add other effects in black ink. When I was learning about how some of my favourite sci-fi art pieces were put together, I found that artists will often use multiple programmes to create their work. This makes sense to me as I find different programmes are good for different things. Adobe Illustrator would be the best drawing programme, but that costs a lot and I don't wish to pirate it. Even if one does purchase it, like the artists I read about, they still use other programmes in addition to it, but I guess this may be personal preference.  Krita and GIMP are free. Krita has some features that I feel GIMP lacks (particularly for drawing shapes), though I am more familiar with GIMP's interface because I use it at work sometimes.  I paid about £30 for black ink off steam during a sale. It's strength is it's brush customisation tools. You can really create some unique brush types and play around with various parameters with an intuitive enough interface. Other than that, I have found limitations in it's layering tools and other shape/line drawing capabilities. Hence why I find for me, it is effective for post processing. Mileage may vary. One aspect of it that may be a pro or a con is that it relies on using your Graphical processor more than other painting programmes do. Not an issue for me as both my CPU and GPU's are good for the tasks I give them but it may be something to consider if you're into that sort of thing.  I use  a Huion H610pro for my tablet. I got it for about £60 off amazon. I think it's really good, has useful buttons, good sensitivity. It's my first tablet and I've enjoyed learning to use it. THe pen works well, though feels a little cheap in build quality. Functionality-wise I haven't encountered any issues. Battery life on the pen is good and it charges via it's own USB cable. More seasoned artists will probably prefer to go for Wacom, which though considered better, is often much more expensive for similar specs (In my experience). If you're new to tablets, this may be something to consider also. My main issue with this tablet is in driver installation. Install Huion tablet drivers before plugging in the tablet as Windows will auto-set up its own drivers when you plug it in. This may be an issue, though not it may also not be. WHen I recently reinstalled my OS, I made this mistake and I think it may be behind my tablet not working great with GIMP anymore. However no issues anywhere else at all (so krita, black ink and general PC use are unaffected and work as normal with the tablet).  A key thing I learned about using a tablet is make sure you have enough desk space. Desk space is limited for me, and positioning the tablet right so I can get into a good position for drawing (i.e. resting my arm on the desk for stability) can be difficult. I guess this depends on how proficient you are with your tablet and how you draw, but it was a major lesson for me. I have to move my keyboard all the way to the side to make space when I want to use it."

Typically, the complaint with that is that the scan is a raster image and people want a vector representation so they can rescale it without pixel artifacts.

I love seeing things like this that inspire me and in turn create a whole world of ideas and possibilities.  Your post has set off a fire in my head of a story of a boy and his infant sister  brought to a small trade caravan years ago. The woman that traveled with them took ill and needed rest and to get back to full strength to raise them both. However she took a turn for the worst and died there. A leader of the caravan took pity on the children and after he saw the markings on the boys arm decided to take them in. He felt that he would be marked as an outcast and felt a kindred spirit to him. As the child grew the markings never faded. However, he was seemingly drawn to maps and could easily understand and commit them to memory. A skill that impressed the caravan leader. He raised him as his son and together they used his gift to turn a small caravan into a traveling merchant city and then into a thriving trade mecca in the desert. Through this entire time, the now King grew in power, took a wife, raised a family and always took care of Arnus. With his fortune he was able to gather maps from all over for him to read and study, something the boy loved dearly. The boy even became adept at recreating them and even more money was made as they sold his creations.  As he grew into a young man it was plain that he would one day marry the Kings oldest Daughter and inherit the kingdom he helped build. Then his young sister took ill. A rash and high fever took hold of her. For nearly a week she sweated and hallucinated with insane visions. At last the fever broke and the rash receded, leaving behind a map like his. This is when Arnus decided that he could no longer hide what he had been doing all of these years. That he was in fact searching for a land mass that would match up to the map on his arm. Now he had a new purpose because if it had appeared on his sister as well, then there was definitely much more to it.  Now he sets out on journey after reports of a man with markings like his makes it back to the city. But what he founds at the edges of the known maps is more than he could imagine. He doesn't just find more questions, but answers. Answers that shake him and things more deadly than simple dragons on the corner of a map.  Here there be Dragons : Part 1 of the Birthmap Trilogy."

Over the years she had grown use to her small ritual and this time was no different. A hard pull three times and a yank left then right. She wasn't satisfied until a bit of pain gripped her palm as she eased her hands. The voice snapped her out of her fog of counting and recounting, checking and rechecking.  ""Nala! Hurry up! We need to leave soon to make it to Treemeet by nightfall.""  Across the crowded market her brother yelled. She knew by his tone he was becoming anxious and her little ritual was causing him problems.  Arnus messed with the dressing on his hand and arm a few more times. It did not hurt as it was not an actual wound. He only wrapped it in strips because it was the way the woman who raised him did for as long as he could remember. He sighed as he turned and stroked his companions face.   ""The trip will be fine Caylah, I promise. Chances are it is nothing. Just some rash a drunken man saw.""  She tries to smile back at him as she holds his hand with both of hers.  ""But what if it isn't? Who knows what it could mean.""   Her tone more serious now she closed her eyes and gave his hand a gentle shake.   ""I knew this would happen when I told you what the merchants saw. But I also knew I had to tell you. You have tried for almost your entire life to find the lands  from your arm. All of the books, and scrolls say nothing. But if what my fathers merchant claims to have saw is true then I can never begin to imagine what you feel. Just promise me no matter what you find you will come back to me."" They pause for a moment as the noise in the market picks up and they lean in to kiss goodbye, Nala saunters in and stops loudly and purposefully with her horse. She clears her throat and snatches the reins causing her mount to step highly but lightly tapping his hooves against the red packed dirt streets. The wind catches her hood and lifts it just enough to show the map markings along her shoulder leading down to her arm then to her hand. Even though very different, her marks resemble Arnus' so much that coupled with the hair and eye color there is no way they can not be marked as brother and sister.  He steps up and onto his larger horse and finally Caylah and he share a small kiss. A flourish and a spin wraps the scarf around his face and head then with a nudge he and Nala set out. The make their way through the crowded streets and towards the gate. Each step he thinks of what could await them out there. He imagines meeting another brother or even a father with these markings.  Another person who can tell him of the lands this map depicts and name the place where his people are from. Where they may still be.  As they make it through the long procession, he holds up right hand to show the symbol of the King. A badge that allows him to come and go as he needs. Many others are turned away at the gate, but he and Nala are beckoned on.  The gate guard smiles wide as he recognizes the two. ""Where do your travels take you today Arnus? More messages to deliver?"" ""No my good man. today we see a man about a map."""

Wouldn't that come off the sea? Admittedly we don't see the sea to the east of the ""Wilds of Entaerdin"", but I'd assume that was the main source of the evaporation.   As regards the boreal forests, the ""Mountains of Glass"" may provide an obstruction for the wind coming in off the sea to the NW, but do not account for the forests to their south, although in the NE of the continent the Frozen Sea may alter the climate to one suitable for forest growth.   The main issue I see is the forests on the Plains of Tulisa. There seems to be no close-by supply of water, and the environment would not be suitable for forest environments.   Also, how bad is it that a major geographical feature is named after a third-rate British pop singer?"
imaginarymaps,2zwuuf,17Hongo,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"With regards to which way the wind blows,  this could vary dependent on where on the map you are. North winds aren't uncommon anywhere,  but typically winds will blow in off the sea. Strong winds coming in from the NE won't affect the NW, which could also be home to several isolated microclimates,  sheltered by the mountains.   It is unlikely that winds coming out of the north will reach the south east, leavingthe area at the mercy of a different wind direction coming in off the nearby eastern coastline,  which could allow for a heavily forested environment in the SE, with relatively light forestation on the eastern side of the mountains in the west.   The height of mountains will also play a part here, and that hasn't been distinguished on the map. Exceptionally high mountains will act as total barriers to the transport of moisture.

imaginarymaps,2zl8fa,IAmFern,6,Thu Mar 19 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:   Assessing The Sword of Shannara three decades after its publication, the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey agreed with Attebery, as Shippey found that the novel was distinctive for ""the dogged way in which it follow[ed] Tolkien point for point"". Within Brooks' novel, Shippey located ""analogues"" for Tolkien characters such as Sauron (Brona), Gandalf (Allanon), the Hobbits (Shea and Flick), Aragorn (Menion), Boromir (Balinor), Gimli (Hendel), Legolas (Durin and Dayel), Gollum (Orl Fane), the Barrow-wight (Mist Wraith) and the Nazgûl (Skull Bearers), among others. He also found plot similarities to events in The Lord of the Rings such as the Fellowship of the Ring's formation and adventures, the journeys to Rivendell (Culhaven) and Lothlórien (Storlock), Gandalf's (Allanon) fall in Moria (Paranor) and subsequent reappearance, and the Rohirrim's arrival at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields (Battle of Tirsys), among others. Avoiding direct commentary on the book's quality, Shippey attributed the book's success to the post-Tolkienian advent of the fantasy genre: ""What The Sword of Shannara seems to show is that many readers had developed the taste ... for heroic fantasy so strongly that if they could not get the real thing they would take any substitute, no matter how diluted.""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Shannara#Sword_and_The_Lord_of_the_Rings"
imaginarymaps,2zl8fa,universe2000,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"This is one person's opinion.  Read the book and decide for yourself.  Personally, I saw very little that reminded me of Tolkien.  There's no Ring, there's no Hobbits, Gandalf and Allanon (the two powerful casters) are nothing alike, etc.     I'm not trying to state I'm right, I'm just saying I knew of this claim and when I read the books myself I did not see the similarities."
imaginarymaps,2zl8fa,IAmFern,5,Thu Mar 19 19:59:58 2015 UTC,"I read the book and while there were some differences, the plot points lined up really closely. Like, amazingly closely. Shea and Flick's journey from their peaceful hometown to Culhaven is reeeeeaally similar to LOTR. And Allanon's fall in Paranor is reeeeeeeaaaally similar to Gandalf's in Moria. I think the wikipedia write-up is pretty good at illustrating this. Even if there are diferences, there are still glaring similarities imo. But, for what it's worth, I think Terry Brooks wrote much better books later on. Even Elfstones is (imo) miles above Sword, which owes so much to LOTR that it is distracting."
imaginarymaps,2zl8fa,universe2000,4,Thu Mar 19 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of this claim prior to the book, but as I read it I got increasing frustrated with how much i thought it mirrored tolkiens work.

I also think Hong Kong is far too big to be called: British Hong Kong. It should be called ""British Guangdong (or Canton if you want to be historically accurate and use Wade-Giles).   EDIT: you could probably get away with calling the 'Ming'  state 'China' or 'Republic of China'.

Off the top of my head they are much more aggressive in the war of 1812, reclaiming parts of New England and New Orleans, they divide the Chinese Empire. Meddling in the continent prevents German States from moving towards unification and ensured France stayed a Republic. They also dominate the Great Game, gaining control over most of the middle east, Afghanistan, Persia, and India.

I can't be bothered to look up hard numbers on the thermal expansion of water, but I know that for most engineering purposes, water is considered to be incompressible, it's volume independent of the temperature or pressure that it's under.  edit: Turns out I could be bothered to do the math.  Percentage of earth's surface currently covered by water: 71  Estimated percentage of earth's surface that would be covered by water with 100m rise in sea levels, assuming rising sea levels cover 20% of existing land: 76.8  Current volume of liquid water in earth's oceans: 321,003,271 cubic miles = 1.338 x 1018 m3  Estimated increase in volume of world's oceans that would be required to make up the 30m difference:   (area of earth) x (average surface area covered by oceans in 30m rise on top of a 70m rise) x 30m = (510.1 million square miles = 5.1 x 1014 m2) x .7593 [1] x 30m = 1.16 x 1016 m3   Estimated increase in volume of earth's oceans if all the ice melted, using the same logic as above:   (area of earth) x (average surface area covered by oceans in 70m rise) x 30m = 5.1 x 1014 m2 x .7303 x 70m = 2.61 x 1015 m3   Percentage increase in volume of thermal expansion:   ((volume currently in oceans) + (volume added by melting ice) + (volume added by thermal expansion)) / ((volume currently in oceans) + (volume added by melting ice)) = (1.338 x 1018 + 2.61 x 1015 + 1.16 x 1016) / (1.338 x 1018 + 2.61 x 1015) = 1.009   So the world's oceans would need to see thermal expansion by that factor in order to make this plausible.  Current average ocean temperature: 62.6 F  Specific volume at this temperature: 0.0160325 ft3 / lb source  Required specific volume for a plausible scenario: (current specific volume) x (ratio increase necessary) = 0.0160325 x 1.009 = 0.01617  Average ocean temperature required to have that specific volume: 110 F  TL;DR / Conclusions - The oceans would need to warm to the point where the average temperature is that of a hot tub or warm sake to make it plausible, given these assumptions. Because the world's oceans act as a heat sink for solar radiation, that means that in such a world your average day would be 110+ degrees. I don't think humans could cope under these conditions, so it's safe to say we'd be dead / off on another planet / hiding on the poles before that happens. [2]  [1] I linearly interpolated between the current percentage of earth's surface covered by oceans, and the estimation, choosing .85 as my alpha (.7 for the rise in sea level due to melting ice, and half of the remaining amount that would need to be accounted for by thermal expansion).  [2] I welcome any critique of my envelope math"
imaginarymaps,2z4723,jmattbacon,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:58:39 2015 UTC,"The IPCC AR4 WG1 estimate that the thermosteric component accounts for ~50% of total sea level rise.  Also, I imagine this map has simply coloured in blue anywhere below 100m above sea level. That's not quite how sea level rise works - it is not uniform, as the ablation of ice sheets causes its geopotential to decrease, reducing the gravitational pull the ocean feels towards the poles. Sea level in fact decreases at the poles, with a marked increase equatorward.  Nor does the thermosteric component result in a uniform increase. It gets very complicated here, as fresh meltwater modifies the thermohaline circulation ever so slightly, changing which areas receive the excess heat from the equator. Solar receipt is also modulated by latitude, so, again, the equator experiences a far greater response to sea level change."

imaginarymaps,2z4723,UNC_Samurai,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:28:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even climate scientists and oceanographers struggle to model any of this. The complexity of the ocean-atmosphere means there is so much variability, something which a simulated model simply cannot replicate due to differences in scale - individual factors completely change when scaled up.  It's difficult to explain, but put simply, the invariable laws of physics we know at the micro scale do not explain the variability we observe at the macro scale. We can't follow the trajectory of a single molecule, or a single component of a complex system, and use that to explain the end result.  TL;DR even experts can't achieve what you're trying to. The community doesn't have the knowledge nor the computational power to do so."
imaginarymaps,2z4723,Alpy94,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"How plausible does the setting sound? Plausible enough to suspend disbelief?     The melting of the ice occurred initially due to an unforeseen reaction with chemical agents that were intended, ironically, to reverse global warming. This has had a non-negligible impact on global weather. The shutdown of the thermohayline cycle initially made Europe colder - but the ice which reflected as much as 85% of the suns radiation has melted, lowering the Earth's albedo. The dark ocean absorbs much more of the suns heat and has warmed considerably, preventing Europe from getting colder as many expected.  In general, the equatorial latitudes are drier than they were before, leading to an expansion of the Sahara and a rain forest die off and the jet stream pushes clouds northwards. Increases water and heat, however, has increased precipitation considerably as one moves up the latitudes toward each pole. The Antarctic desert has managed to increase precipitation enough to allow grasslands to begin developing, but the soil is very poor and not suitable for farming.  The permafrost in Eurasia has melted, and the land has become more fertile but temperature differences between summer, when the northern latitudes face the sun and absorb more heat, and winter, when the reverse occurs, are much greater. Winters in the latitudes toward the poles tend to be colder than in the real world, but drier - and summers much hotter and more humid.  Snow still exists, and temperatures are not unlivable but the ocean itself is much warmer, especially in the poles, and new ice cannot form as a result. The salinity of the ocean is also measurably lower, and there is a massive disruption among marine life especially.  The poles played a significant role in reflecting solar radiation - without them, incidences of cancer among humans has gone up and DNA has mutated more rapidly in all species. Seeing mutated or genetically deformed plants, animals, and humans has become much more common and though it has only been sixty years, signs of rapid evolution has occurred among short lived animals, particularly insects."

imaginarymaps,2z1zte,PisseGuri82,0,Sun Mar 15 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"So there's still several things wrong with the rivers. Rivers follow very specific rules and need a VERY good reason to diverge from those rules. On the right side of your map, you have the river split; one end continues through the land while the other empties into the ocean. Rivers don't split, they merge with more rivers. After that split, you have to determine reasons why your river empties out into the ocean to the north instead of flowing south. In reality, this probably wouldn't  happen. Water follows the path of least resistance. All rivers flow south.  The other river on that landmass on the bottom left wouldn't happen either. A river won't start and then flow north. And a river wouldn't flow the opposite way and be fed by an ocean. The same thing applies to the rivers on your top right landmass and your top left one. Oceans won't feed a river, nor will they flow north.  However, the cluster of 4-5 islands you have, THAT river on the one would happen. Starts in the land and flows south.  Last are the two lands on the bottom left. You sort of have it right but not quite. The big river and the tiny river are fine, but the one that connects ocean to ocean probably wouldn't happen either.  I suggest finding videos on how rivers form and how they work.  Rivers are created mostly up on mountains or from general runoff but mostly mountains. It snows in the mountains, then as it melts, it runs down the mountain in tiny trickles. Gradually those trickles meet up and become bigger and bigger and bigger until you have a full blown river. A river will never split into two rivers unless something very significant causes it to split, but it likely won't. Second, lakes are formed when rivers reach an area that is too deep for it continue flowing. If there is no path of least resistance, water pools. However if the lake fills up enough to reach an overflow point, a river will begin to form and continue from there.  That's not to say that rivers don't twist and turn but that have to be reasonable turns. A river may take a south-east turn or maybe even a full east turn for a LITTLE bit, but unless mountains are in the way or large hills, a full east turn won't span over a continent. Eventually, it has to turn south or empty into a ocean somewhere nearby. Try taking a close looking at some major rivers like the Mississippi or the Nile or smaller ones. Find ones that go through mountains and see what they do.   Basic rule though: north to south"
imaginarymaps,2z1zte,Aeras4109,5,Sun Mar 15 12:21:44 2015 UTC,"All rivers flow south.   Well, no. A river has no idea what is north or south, it just flows downwards. If the terrain to the north is lower than the terrain in the south, such as in Siberia, it will flow north. Some major examples are the Nile, the Rhine and of course most of the Russian ones like Yenisey or Ob. The Thames goes pretty straight eastwards. Direction doesen't matter, terrain does."
imaginarymaps,2z1zte,PisseGuri82,0,Mon Mar 16 09:23:35 2015 UTC,"If you read my entire reply, you will notice at some point, possibly even twice that I said water follows the path of least resistance. This is the exact same thing as the height of terrain. Water does flow south. Given a completely flat terrain, water won't flow north unless something forces it to. It'll turn north for a bit, but not across a country. It'll turn south eventually. I even specifically mentioned mountains will prevent a river from going south and force it to go whichever way until it can regain south as its flow."

imaginarymaps,2yyz43,Lastonk,3,Sat Mar 14 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"well what I'm picturing in my head, is down the length of the cylinder are huge 15 kilometer artificial cinder cone volcanoes, hollow on the inside and lined with mirrors that focus light from the sun (outside the cylinder is a spiraling reflective ribbon like mirror, counter rotating to offset torque as well as keep the light-wells lit), three of these very thin but impossibly tall mountains act like spokes on a wheel, and in the center is a very hot focus point of a molten salt material, that acts to both regulate the temperature and provide specific wavelengths of light. (I figure seven of these little suns would be optimal)  since one end of the colony would always be pointed at the sun, this would allow the twisting outer ribbon to control how much sun gets into the colony, and therefore give a precise night and day format.  It would mitigate some of the radiation issues, as the end facing the sun would be heavily shielded.  That counter rotating ribbon would also act as a regulator for micro twist gravity problems.   both the ribbon and the outer surface of the tube would consist mainly of a woven carbon fiber wrapped many times by the drones  that built the tube, filled with mined asteroid and comet materials, including nitrogen and oxygen for air and then spun it to form much of the land inside. So the position of land masses other than the spokes and suns would be kinda random. so no two of these colony worlds would look the same inside, except for the seven suns and a few other important elements.  the same drones would then use a future version of Craig Venters dna 3d printer to print living dna from base materials, and fill the cylinder with life. Bacteria, followed by micro organisms and so on in increasingly complex layers till you get a biosphere.  All of this done by self replicating drones without  a human ever stepping foot on the colony.  In my novels I'm picturing these runaway drones create ten trillion of these colonies, every one of them different. and humans have not visited more that 5% of them. They create a full dyson swarm in orbit around the sun."

This is in regards to right continent resembling Eastern Europe and Asia but overall not enough to say its just a tweaked Earth.  We're all so use to the map of Earth, and its top-heavyness. if you turned it upside down it looks weird, just due to the largest land mass being at the bottom."
imaginarymaps,2yl6oj,vereonix,9,Tue Mar 10 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I was kinda the same way as you, but unlike you I think it looks a bit too familiar. I tried flipping the whole thing upside down, but then it just looks like south east Asia (Indonesia-area). I also tried just to flip the right side of the map upside down, which means I ended up with the bottom-heaviness you speak about. And I must agree, that my first though of this wasn't a continental map, but just an archipelago. Properly due to our general perception if the world being top-heavy as you say.  I think we just have to wait for scientists to discover a new planet with loads of water, so we can change this perception. Until then take a look at the right-side-flipped-over map. It gets better the more you look at it."

Look at the earth for what regions tend to have really jagged coastlines and what areas have smoother coastlines and why.  Look at what biomes tend to be next to each other in nature.  Think about wind patterns, large and small, and how those influence rainfall.  The same for ocean currents.  If you have a feature that breaks the pattern have a story for it to explain why it breaks the pattern."

No, they also wouldn't cede land to Mongolia, nobody would be powerful enough to force that.  What happened to India? Just a random split? Why is Tibet part of an Indian union?  Sudan re-unifying? nah.  Why would Scotland join a Scandinavian union? It would be weaker than a European union.  Russia is not going to annex that much of Ukraine full stop, especially if it's in the position to let Siberia(s?) and the Caucasian lands go.  Montenegro would not rejoin Serbia.

There, they enjoy total sovereignty and freedom from taxation. Foremost among them are the 'nine divines', the largest and most influential of the megacorps.   Where the money flows, the talent goes; the corporate colonisation of skyrim has brought with it an influx of specialists from all over Tamriel. Laseraxe-toting Orc mercenaries, glitched up Dunmer hackers, corpsec Altmer wage-mages, and a plethora of other freelancers sell their skills to the highest bidder.  Ever since the Daedric Princes got in on the insurance game, everything has been different; specialists can now subscribe to a life insurance plan, rendering even death a problem credits can fix."

imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,djreoofficial,3,Thu Mar 5 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Your urban planning could use some work, but the map looks great! I've always tried to get things looking that crisp but never managed it."
imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,djreoofficial,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:29:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Would you mind elaborating on your first point? This is my first metro-style map and my first digital piece in general, so there is definitely room for improvement."
imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,joewaffle1,3,Fri Mar 6 15:58:54 2015 UTC,"Sure! The first piece of advice I have would be to avoid looping lines (except for a center line, like in London) or those that travel in opposite directions at some points. In your case, this includes the loops on the orange and red lines, as well as the ""scoop"" on the purple line. Second, cutting off lines or ending them within the core region of the area you're looking at. This comes up with the abrupt end to your turquoise line. Third, don't have the end of one line be the beginning of another on the same plane, unless there's some extenuating circumstance about how the track won't work or it's at a different height, etc. This occurs at the Ivarstead station between the green and red lines and the Windhelm station (most prominently between the blue and red lines)."

imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,Trainwiz,2,Fri Mar 6 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"My real world experience with metro lines is limited pretty much only to Toronto and Vancouver, and here in Vancouver we have a similarly strange looping line with an abrupt end, so I guess that's what I must have had in mind when I created some of the routes. That and I tried to emphasize visual balance over actual functionality."
imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,Francoiky,2,Fri Mar 6 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Well it's understandable why you created the map you did, then. Toronto's metro breaks two of the rules. Its yellow line travels in opposite directions and its green and blue lines meet at one station with neither continuing past it, but I believe that may be due to height or track differences that I mentioned earlier. Vancouver, as you've pointed out, has a bit of a loop but nothing too egregious."
imaginarymaps,2y2cdt,drtysoc,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:33:54 2015 UTC,wonderful map! I agreed that there seemed to be some redundancies so I fiddled with it a bit (Just using Paint so don't mind the quality).   Mind you i'm not urban planner  http://i.imgur.com/TyTfQ6b.jpg

imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,ThatScruffyLookinGuy,10,Tue Mar 3 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"First off, great map!  Love the linework.  As far as climate goes, it generally helps to conceptualize your world as  just that, a world.  Typically, life sustaining planets are thought to have stable orbits, whereby the solar equator fluctuates between tropics (ranging from 23.5 deg latitude on our Earth).  If you can think of a tropical zone that is the focus for solar induced convection in the atmosphere, coupled with westerly winds (supposing a Coriolis effect from it's rotation), two high pressure polar zones (shearing cold masses that slowly migrate towards the equator), and then regional influences as well (such as maritime v. continental climates) you can develop a brusque understanding of how the surface may look.    If you have any idea how ocean currents may move throughout your world, then you can couple that with what you decide prevailing wind patterns to be.  If wind blows regularly over warm ocean currents and then runs into mountain ranges then you have a very moist region (think monsoon).  Also, since the orographic effect of the mountain range would dry out the air, the lee side of mountains are generally very dry."
imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,godismad,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:25:23 2015 UTC,Thank you very much!
imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,SwoopersPoop,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:27:26 2015 UTC,Had a go at working out the climate of the world before I redraft based on your advice. Haven't done the winds yet. I'd appreciate it if you let me know what you thought.  Blank  Climate
imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,valiantcrossbow,2,Thu Mar 5 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"For some reason, when I see that map, I think ""Dallinian"". What's the name of your novel or the plot? It might be helpful to base the name of the world off of the plot. I know that most novels don't really name their worlds after their plot or title, but it's a suggestion."
imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,valiantcrossbow,3,Wed Mar 4 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"The more I say it aloud the more I like it.  The novel doesn't have a name yet, and not much of a plot. I figure what the world looks like shapes the various civilizations, religions and cultures in it, they in turn shape the people in the world and the people drive the plot. So best place for me to start I think is to get this map to a place where I'm happy with it."
imaginarymaps,2xtnvv,johnprattchristian,3,Wed Mar 4 12:20:22 2015 UTC,"Or Dallian, something a little more simple based off yours, I totally agree, it totally look like that would be its name."

imaginarymaps,2xs9in,harrymuesli,21,Tue Mar 3 13:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think the capitals don't really make much sense. Berlin isn't that big, and is sandwiched between the other two. Also, why choose Berlin if there's London? The same goes for Warsaw and Moscow, or Rome and London, or Warsaw and St. Petersburg, or Warsaw and anywhere else really."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,vSity,5,Tue Mar 3 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"This had to do with personal preference, but also with the idea of not having the largest city also be the capital of the country. Australia, Canada, the US and a number of other countries have the same, so instead of going for the easy choices (Paris, London, Moscow), I tried to pick the second or third cities."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,i2white2remember,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"Also if you look at it with all these nations or unions trade would be petty steady. Cities that would often onky have smaller train would then gain mass traffic. Therefore, cities like warsaw might actually work because they would be used as a stop to other cities in the union."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Klaw117,36,Sat Mar 14 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"Romania and Moldova speak a Romance language. They should really be put into the Roman Republic. Of course, if the Slavic Union is hostile with it, then including the exclave would be a logistical nightmare."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Bergber,19,Tue Mar 3 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"Hungarian is also non-Slavic, which has historically been in the way of Russia's attempts at 'Pan-Slavism.'  To be more accurate, I guess they, Estonia, and Finland could found an 'Uralic Union.'"
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Valdincan,2,Tue Mar 3 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Slavic Union probably wasn't the best name to concoct but I liked the idea of 'general-sounding'/stereotypical names, so I didn't give them a lot of thought and just typed the brainfarts that came up. Any name would be okay though - if it were the Nordic Alliance, the Mediterranean Union and the Eastern Federation, that'd be fine too. Or any other of the thousands of names one could think up.   And indeed, one could probably divide the map more accurately by shifting several borders and creating some new unions. My idea, though, was to create three kind of equal unions: the SU would be numerically superior and cover an area from the Black Sea to North Korea, the GF would be the world's powerhouse of production and the RR would control the Mediterranean and be a good second to the GF GDP- and population-wise."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Klaw117,6,Tue Mar 3 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"But its probably not bases on just language; Romania and Moldova are certainly closer to russia than Italy culturally, and have been under russian influence for ages. Finland and the Baltics aren't german, but probably feel closer affinity to Germanics then Slavs (even if for political reasons)."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,TheWinterKing,3,Tue Mar 3 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yep it's a combination of several things really. Religion, culture, language, geopolitics, the way the UN divides up Europe into blocks, and so forth."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Valdincan,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:58:05 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. It was the naming of the unions made me think that the primary basis for the unions was linguistics. Germanic and Slavic are two language families and from there, it seemed logical to me that the ""Roman"" in the Roman Republic would imply a union based on the Romance languages."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,TheWinterKing,7,Wed Mar 4 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"In addition, Greek is not a Romance language."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Valdincan,11,Tue Mar 3 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"But Greek and Italian culture share a long, interconnected past, and are both distinctly ""mediterranean"" (both could be considered the archetype of the ""mediterranean"", at least to outsiders through popular culture)"
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,Radulno,2,Tue Mar 3 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"I guess we need to know if the idea was to divide the map along linguistic, ethnic, or cultural lines, or something else.  I see what you're saying about Greece and Italy. I'd say they both helped to define European Classicism, but Greece shares as much historically with Turkey as it does with Italy."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,hetmankp,3,Tue Mar 3 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Greece (and Byzantium) and Turkey ( and the Ottomans) share the same cultural ties as Greece and Italy. Of course greece and turkey are extremely important in each others history, and share many cultural aspects, but looking at customs, cuisine, architecture and general interactions, I still see a greater link between Italy and Greece."
imaginarymaps,2xs9in,troopah,3,Tue Mar 3 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"If you go for cultural ressemblances, we have a problem with France. Northern France is for some part way closer of Belgium/Netherlands/Germany culture than the Southern European cultures. But Southern France is closest to Italy or Spain (depending of East/West)."

imaginarymaps,2xs9in,valiantcrossbow,6,Wed Mar 4 10:35:25 2015 UTC,"I kinda doubt Berlin and Warsaw would be the best capitals. London, Oslo or Copenhagen would be more protected and/or centrally positioned than Berlin which is basically a border city. Kiev would be the natural capital of the Slavic union, but Moscow would be the most realistic choice given today's politics. I'd also suggest Bucharest as capital for the Slavic union because that ginormous palace Ceausescu built is fit for a Tsar. However in any case Warsaw seems like an unlikely choice as it is too exposed to the Germans."

Actually Zinabs had a colony on Fire Peninsula, Zairanab, it's on map as important site. It once severed the communication with Zinabu Island and was never heard of again. Blame Meraians and their illusion magic for the borders there."

Similarly Estonia and Northern Latvia are reduced o the old Livonia, with its capital in Riga.  Hungary and Croatia are back in their pre-ww1 configuration, with Croatia holding parts of Bosnia and losing parts of Dalmatia.

I can tell you, there is absolutely no sentiment, thought or desire in anyone for independence. It makes no sense at all for it to be separated from Iran.  Same goes for Baluchistan, they have been part of Iran for so long with such a shared history and culture that they too would never separate, if for no reason other than economic. If they did, they would have nothing.  Kurdistan taking Iranian land is also a bit out there, not so much as the other two. The Shah said himself the Kurds are the truest Persians. Kurds, Persians, Mazandaranians, Gilaki's and other small groups in Iran are all in the same ethnic group, in the Middle East pan-Iranian ethnicity is a very powerful thing, especially in the face of growing Arab aggression.  I won't bother with Azerbaijan, its situation lies between Baluchistan and Kurdish land and it has very strong religious ties. I understand this is ""imaginary"" maps, but the stability of Iran's territory isn't being considered here and the map seems more concerned with trying to find all the slight regional differences and justifying a seperate country. It would be like carving France to countries like Britanny, Occitan/Occitia, Louraine, etc....   All of this land has been a part of Iran for hundreds and hundreds of years with no real movements for independace. While Azerbaijan has a large Turkish identity it still has strong ties to Persian culture and history and would not separate from Iran.  As a side note, this map gives too much land to ""South Azerbaijan"" in the south east, that is Gilan and they are Gilaki and share more similarities to Mazandaranians and Persians than Azerbaijan."

Additionally, the Shi'i areas of Greater Bahrain/al-Hasa in Eastern Arabia are culturally very different from the rest of the country.

imaginarymaps,2x9zzs,justbootstrap,-8,Thu Feb 26 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"It's hard to argue that Hitler wasn't racist, because he clearly was, but not towards Slavs. Lumping every form of hatred under racism makes racism appear as something which has deep social causes, when in fact its sum total is the ""ugh that guy's skin is totally gross, is he even human"".  A white man killing Jews (unless they're Beta Israel Jews) for being ethnically Jewish or Slavs for being ethnically Slavic isn't racism. It's xenophobic, bigoted, nationalistic, evil, criminal and bat shit crazy, but it was not racist because despite whatever Hitler and his cronies might have believed Jews, Slavs and Germans are of the same race, which ultimately is the thing that bothers neo-Nazis the most to this day, causing them to reach for ever more colorful theories to try and explain it away."

You can literally find textbooks from like the 1990s and probably even later in many countries which still maintain the separation into five races by skin color which has been used by Europeans basically since they found out there are people of different skin colors. It's not exactly a mystery how it was derived.  No one's saying that it's based on any underlying difference, which is what makes it that more disturbing as a concept. If you mix in social and ethnic discrimination into it then you're basically making it seem less crazy, because those are tangible differences."
imaginarymaps,2x9zzs,Uberbobo7,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"Except the Nazis had a different concept of race based on Voelkisch ideology. They believed that there was a concept they called ""Voelk"" that tied nationality, ethnicity, and race together as a singular concept.   To the Nazis, Aryans were a different race than the Jewish population. If you look at the Nuremberg Laws and their ""genetic"" (If it can be called that) idea of how ""Jewish-ness"" spread through blood, it's very clear that they perceived them as a distinct race that had different blood than the ideal Aryan.   A decently-sized image to show their idea of how Jewish/Aryan blood mixed.  As race is socially defined, just how you admit it is, the way the Nazis defined it shows them as racist. They didn't hate the Jewish people because they saw them as somehow biologically different. They fully believed that Jewish people having children with Aryans would lead to a polluted bloodline.  The same went for Slavs. To the Nazis, the ""Deutschevoelk"" were their own specific grouping of people that could be defined entirely on their blood, with the most pure being the blonde-haired blue-eyed Aryans.   They saw Jewish and Slavic peoples as a different race. Their perception of that racial difference is what led to their hatred of them. They institutionalized this hatred into systematic violence based on their perception of race.  That is racism."

You can't use their social definitions to describe conclusions based upon non-Nazi social definitions. In the Nazi social definition Jews and Slavs were a different race which was to be by their definition justifiably exterminated.   In the non-Nazi European social definition Slavs, Jews and Germans are members of the same white race (as pretty much every country in Europe decries the Nazi definition as the idiocy it was) and Germans committed a crime against humanity (genocide) against them.  I don't see how the self image of Nazis is relevant. They were the champions of outlandish social definitions that no one except other Nazis ever accepted."
imaginarymaps,2x9zzs,Uberbobo7,0,Fri Feb 27 16:00:06 2015 UTC,"Because race is entirely socially constructed.  When people considered the Irish and Italians to be non-whites, we refer to it as racism against Irish and Italians because the acts were based in their perception of race. They hated them because, from their perspective, it was another race. It was discrimination and prejudice based on race.   When Nazis saw the Jewish people as a separate race, and the Slavic people as a separate race, they were drawing the same kind of lines that Americans did when they looked down at Irish and Italian immigrants as non-whites.  Race can be a physical or an ethnic construct. Sometimes both. It's a constantly evolving social construct. That's why the way the Nazis saw race is important.  Their hate was based on their perception of race, which makes it a racist discrimination. I think it makes perfect sense."

Kinda like how a Sunni killing an Alawite might be considered an inter-religious conflict by the Islamic state, but from the accepted social views in the rest of the world it's just one Muslim killing another in a sectarian conflict. And unless you're from the caliphate you would most likely hold the latter view. The same applies to WASPs and Italians, and Germans and Russians. While the WASPs might have saw themselves as interacting with another race the idea that they weren't the same race would be funny and strange to most Europeans of the time. This is especially true if you consider that the primary reason why WASPs didn't like the Irish, Italians and Poles was because they were Catholic. I doubt that converts to a protestant denomination from those groups had many issues. On the other hand most black people were protestants and both the WASPs and the Irish and the Italians discriminated against them solely because they were black. If you looked white (even if one of your parents was black or asian) chances are you'd have little to no problems going about your business without suffering the same discrimination your brother (from the same parents) would if he looked black."

imaginarymaps,2wzgva,kingxanadu,8,Tue Feb 24 14:48:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, when I made this map, I was going for more of a 'wild west' aesthetic; vast desert/outback landscapes, expansive farmlands, raiders and bandits attacking traders as they rode past on their horses (there are very few, if any, vehicles left in this world); that sort of thing. Though I can see how you'd get the Mad Max vibe from the map itself."

imaginarymaps,2woz45,Wereflea,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think that I would have put a little more definition in the mountains but then my maps tend to be overly dense which is why I keep coming back to your enviable lack of clutter, understated but still very tasteful depiction and a notably elegant use of line. You succeed in allowing the viewer's eye to travel around the seemingly impassible Tangle and perhaps lose their way in the Mistlands and complete their trek to 'there and back again' all the way up to the Duskmarsh (just because from the way it's drawn, it looks like I'd want to go there) and the general area from Wildsedge to Ostbenn in particular. Really very nice work.  But your definition of the mountains seems so inexplicably sparse, almost jarring in their triangular simplicity in contrast to the more refined treatment elsewhere. That careful balancing of tone around the Duskmarsh region is very well done but where is that same attention to light and dark in the triangles? I think you are making a mistake (not catastrophic) in leaving them so severe and minimalist. Because you are so successful elsewhere, the simple triangle effect seems out of place. I was disappointed in fact in not getting a chance to seei how you presented that physiographic landform. It is like these mountains aren't keeping up their part of the bargain and not doing as much work as the artwork in the other regions. I'm not saying to make them so densely drawn that they don't fit the bright tone of the map but I am saying that a simple triangle with a slight bit of shading lets us, the fantasy traveler, down. You've made such a fine map, I don't understand why you drew them that way. If severity was your aim then why create the thorn branches emergeing from the tangle or the tonal balance in the marshy regions of the northeast?  Then again it is none of my business but nevertheless, I think you are a talented map maker and I really was/am a bit disappointed at there being only triangles (stick figure mountains?).You do good work and people who love maps would like to see it. I know I wanted to.  A darn nice map in any case. Congrats!"

Unfortunately the development has ceased. So now Inkscape is the most similar.  I have used both Photoshop and Inkscape in the past, but now I prefer using the OpenStreetmap tools like JOSM (editor) and Maperitive (Renderer), even for imaginary maps. Just save your work locally and never upload anything to the OSM servers, and it's fine for imaginary maps as well."

Water follows the path of least resistance. That means water follows the same path downstream every time. There are exceptions to these, like low, flat wetlands (where deltas form), and the occasional creek like North Two Ocean Creek. But that's a measly creek and not a heavy-volume river.  Think of it this way: rivers and their tributaries are shaped like trees. The tree is ""planted"" on the coastline where the mouth of the river is, and the leaves of the tree are the sources of small creeks that lead into the main river (the trunk). Trees can be next to other trees, but they don't really connect to each other.  You're gonna have to fix the issue of your lakes having multiple rivers draining them."

However, as someone who studied Fluviology, that tributary split in the bottom left makes me twitch..."
imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,Skitterleaper,2,Mon Feb 16 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"May i ask, why?"
imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,chiguireitor,2,Mon Feb 16 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"It's very unusual for a river to form a nearly T-shaped split like that, especially in its middle/lower course. The erosive forces at play tend to make for a more Y-shaped split, if only because you have the force of the river impacting the far bank as it arrives, gradually eroding at it.  However, having re-looked at it in the light of day, it does seem to transition to a different rock type there and so it's possible it's a harder, less easily eroded rock that formed a literal wall. Also, it looks like the water impacting it has formed a pool, which would be in keeping.  Also, ya know, magic. So maybe I should just shush and enjoy the lovely map. It's been ages since my fluviology courses anyway."
imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,Skitterleaper,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"Naah, it was an interesting read anyways. Sometimes basing fantasy on realistic properties makes for interesting content. We from procedural generation backgrounds have two types of algorthmic generators: Teleological and Ontogenetic. The teleological algorithms base their generation process on physical properties like the ones you describe. Thx!"
imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,chiguireitor,2,Tue Feb 17 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"My pleasure! Out of interest, how do Ontogenetic models work?  EDIT: Also, if i want to take issue with something I should probably take issue with that giant lava cauldron, but that's something of a fantasy staple I guess :P"

imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,spqr2001,2,Mon Feb 16 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"Looks deeply inspired by the middle earth map, although not exactly the same, the layout seems a lot like it."
imaginarymaps,2w0cx9,chiguireitor,2,Mon Feb 16 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"A fun map to read. I'd love to see your 3D oblique treatment (with appropriate scale) used in a realistic fantasy map. For example, your forest on this map is really cool. A bit too festive for my taste lol but an excellent solution for depicting a forest without it being a drab monolithic block of bumpy edged green. I also love the way you illustrate (in this case punctuate) a small region with the occasional tree or two and the other minor elements like the rock ledges, the crop fields and such and on a rolling landscape too instead of only flat expanses.  Really very nice work.  Oh (and this is none of my business but at least I admit it up front lol) I notice in your other scenes and to some extent the clouds/ocean in this one that you maximize a specific color scheme. Everything is in shades of blue'/grey in the cavern or the graveyard or the ice etc. You do great work don't get me wrong but small contrasting highlights help define as well as set off the blueness of a section on the canvas whereas having all blues whether light and dark has the effect of dampening details to the eye.   Legend background2 does it but those are structured colored highlights... only the lamps etc. I am talking more of splashes of color not to distinguish a lamp but maybe as part of a grey stone block or blue/white ice column.  This impressionistic treatment became a trademark style for Frazetta but he took it to extremes just to see if it worked. Well it did. But you needn't push it like Frazetta did. Nevertheless a simple log would still look 'all' brown but the eye would be drawn momentarily to small contrasting colors of purple or blue or red etc highlights on that mostly brown log.  I think you'd be superb at it since you use color so dramatically anyway. I know you want to accentuate the 'fire pit/volcanic' element in this drawing but a sparse few 'brushstrokes' of color would actually help accentuate it more by letting the yellow/orange of the area sit more comfortably in its location in relation to the whole map. As if the contrasting colors tie in all the color regions to the map as a whole. Just a few twinkles of color on an edge or a bit of purple added to the blue shadow etc.  I am not talking about the town's bright red roofs but just a few understated swathes or splotches of muted yet still contrasting colors say for those pale blue rocks/cliffs where the lower river cuts through to the sea and the clouds too.   In any case, you do very professional work. Quite good in fact."

If your plan is to establish three kingdoms, you didn't make that clear in the title. Also, British Isles rather than Britain.  A 'Greater Ulster' would take some skilled politicking to achieve. I'm not holding my breath. Is there any clamour for regional assemblies in Ireland? I think Shetland and Orkney would both want their own assembly in such an arrangement. Not sure about your Scottish regions. I think a 'Central Belt West' and 'Central Belt East', a Borders region and maybe a 'Mainland North' and a 'Highlands and Islands' might be more realistic Why does Wales get Herefordshire? Also, given how the northern Cymry feel about the valley dwellers (and vice versa) they might want two regions. England looks a right pig's ear. I can see Yorkshire and the northern one, maybe combined with Scottish Borders, but everything south of that is a bit iffy. Manchester could make the case for a region of its own and then Liverpool would whine until they got one. In the end, they'd be prepared to cohabit. They'd certainly turn their noses up at having to share with Gloucs. No shared identity there. That's wezcunry, me ducks. Otherwise, Mercia, East Anglia and Wessex are the natural regions. London seems to be based on the old Middlesex, which is a bit daft. Much better to use the Greater London boundary or even add some outer suburbs to make Londonland. And Cornwall, gawd bless em.

Like I said in another post (with source), that is projected to take approximately 5,000 years.  Keep in mind, we are coming out of a period of glaciation, so glacial retreat is normal.  Is it occurring faster than in the past?  Yes.  Are CO2 levels in the atmosphere the cause of that?  Most likely.  However, we're unsure of when glaciation may begin to reoccur.  The planet's tilt is somewhat eccentric, and that has a massive effect on glaciation.  There are also theories that current desalinization levels could disrupt existing ocean currents, the same currents that keep the northern hemisphere temperate and largely glacier free.  Of course, a large change axial tilt, while highly unpredictable, isn't predicted to happen in the near future, and the ocean currents that are theorized to be disrupted aren't showing any signs of disruption yet, but neither is 100 feet of sea level rise and especially 216 feet of sea level rise.  The absolute most we could realistically see in the next hundred years, as I mentioned before (again, with source), is one meter, but the more likely rise is going to be in the ballpark of half a meter.    I guess the whole point of this is that all of these projections are massively and unnecessarily alarmist."

imaginarymaps,2vm1mv,TheAughtSpectrum,11,Thu Feb 12 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you everybody!  I found this sub through t he random button and figured I would post it! I was inspired to draw this when I had briefly got into magic the gathering a few years back. I researched the innistrad game world locations (no map exists), and then found a map somebody had put online using warhammer (the empire) to map out the locations. So I uses that as a rough blueprint.  Altogether the map took a lot of time. I typically worked in 1 hour stretches and it took about 80 sessions if I remember correctly.  I did the work in pencil first, then fine tip black sharpy, erased the pencil, then colored w more fine tip sharpy.  One of the strategies I used was to incorporate a ton of very fine parallel lines - a style I don't know that I've used before but wanted to experiment with. In this way I could produce more color shades with a limited number of base colors.  You can't really see that level of detail in this scan but I'm considering putting up an art portfolio on my website with higher quality scans soon.  I had started a second work and am about 1/3 done with the pencil but took a break. I'm going to start working on it again this weekend.  Thanks again for all the support! For those asking about prints, let me figure out how to do it! I might have to do a deviant art page! :)"

North America is divided into rather utilitarian territory names (Tiger Empire, United States of Lions) while more distant locations get ""exotic"" names like Raji-Land and Mao-Tse-Tigers which seem like cultural caricatures.   But, it's not something I'm on expert on, and maybe it's just a harmless use of a cultural shorthand to provide some character and flavor to a map.

imaginarymaps,2uxz4t,Kh0rneFlakes,10,Fri Feb 6 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"(Copied from Wikipedia.)This alternate timeline incorporates both fictional and actual historic events. According to the series' official backstory, the divergent timeline begins after World War I, when a ""Regionalist movement"" gains popularity in America following the Spanish influenza pandemic, rallying behind an isolationist platform. Meanwhile, President Wilson's authority was undercut when Prohibition failed as a constitutional amendment leaving the matter to be decided on the state level. The nation soon became polarized between ""wet"" and ""dry"" states and checkpoints became a common sight on state borders to stop the flow of alcohol into ""dry"" states. As the decade progressed, state governments seized more authority, encroaching into areas formerly the responsibility of the federal government, and formed regional power blocs.  The optimism of the Roaring Twenties was upset in 1927 when an outbreak of a deadly strain of influenza in America prompted states to close their borders, further dividing the Union. Though not as deadly as the 1918 pandemic, the epidemic had immense political fallout, bolstering regionalist ""strong state"" views and decreasing voter turnout in the 1928 elections. Shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Texas seceded from the United States, forming the Republic of Texas on January 1, 1930. New York was the next state to secede, and persuaded Pennsylvania and New Jersey to merge with it to form the Empire State. California followed suit, creating the Nation of Hollywood, as did Utah, which had already come in conflict with the federal government after the establishment of the Smith Law in 1928 that made Mormonism the state religion. Washington, D.C., essentially powerless, was unable to stop the country from falling apart. The federal government made its last stand against the 'People's Revolt' of the bread basket states. When the US Army was defeated by the People's Collective (formerly the Midwest) forces in 1931, the fate of the United States was sealed, and the rest of the country dissolved into independent nations by the end of 1932 with last legal remnant of the US being the neutral nation of Columbia in what used to be whatever area around Washington could be seized.  Though not directly affected by the Texas Secession, Canada found itself dragged down by the collapse of the U.S., with Quebec seceding in 1930 and the rest of the provinces siding with their nascent southern neighbors: New Brunswick and parts of Quebec joined the Maritime Provinces of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; Newfoundland joined Quebec; Manitoba joined the People's Collective as did parts of Saskatchewan, with the Lakota nation laying claim to the rest; British Columbia merged with Oregon and Washington in Pacifica; and Alaska claimed the Yukon territories. The core of the former Canadian government established the Protectorate of Ontario. While Ottawa's authority technically extends to Alberta and the Northwest Territories, these areas are mostly no-man's land, while Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island comprise a self-governing body, commonly referred to as the Northumberland Association.  In 1931, the Territorial Government of Hawaii was left defenseless in the wake of the fragmenting country and was overthrown in favor of the monarchy with Jonah Kūhiō as its king. Likewise, America's territorial holdings overseas were surrendered following the nation's formal collapse and the formation of the Federal Republic of Columbia on March 1, 1932.[13]  The resulting nation-states that formed were no longer unified—distrust between them strained diplomatic relations to the point that several small-scale wars broke out.[13][14]  After the dissolution of the United States, the country's interstate railroad and highway systems fell into disrepair or were sabotaged as they crossed hostile borders. Consequently, ground-based vehicles such as the locomotive and automobile were replaced by aircraft such as the airplane and the zeppelin as the leading mode of transportation in North America. Europe soon followed this fascination with aviation to make its own strides into the new, aerially-dominated market. Gangs of air pirates formed in turn to plunder airborne commerce. Although air militias formed to counter the threat, rivalries between the nations of North America reduced their capacity to effectively address this issue, and even encouraged the countries to sponsor pirates as privateers so as to direct their illegal operations against opposing nations. In Europe, privateers and other mercenary groups have been adopted widely by nations who wish to avoid another world war, especially in the case of the Spanish Civil War.  By the end of 1937, North America is a ""hotbed of conflict,"" with multiple pirate gangs and air militias battling for control of the skies. Europe is no better, as Germany jockeys for power while France and Britain look the other way. The Russian States continue to fight their civil war, which threatens to spill over into the Eastern European nations and Alaska. Asia, too, is on the brink, with Japan's recent invasion of China and the continuation of the bloody civil war in Australia."

imaginarymaps,2uwiki,ZombineTM,14,Thu Feb 5 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Here's some of my thoughts/critiques on this, in your scenario.  China has no reason to annex Mongolia, it serves better as a puppet state like it does today. It is likely that the ethnically Mongolian Tannu Tuva will be taken from 'NATO Siberia' and annexed to Mongolia though.  A German state of East Prussia? Impossible. Not only are Germans forbidden from owning land in 'Kaliningrad Oblast', Poland (who controls the rest of former Prussia since 1945) would never allow it. It's more likely to be annexed to Poland or Lithuania.  Shiite and Sunni Iraq, but no changes to Syria? Unlikely. The Saudi dictators would never allow a Shiite state on their northern border unless this is heavily backed by Iran, in which case it's more likely that a major part of Syria together with the Shiite parts of Iraq would form an Iranian protectorate. In this case there's likely a war, or at best ""cold war"", between the radical Sunnis lead by the Saudis on the one hand, perhaps through its puppets (basically ISIS), and Iran-backed Shiites on the other hand.  In a world with changing borders, the annexation of West Sahara by Morocco will finally be recognised. Either the remaining bit of desert will be an ""independent"" Polisario state, or it will outright join with Mauretania under a new Berber-lead regime (which might be fighting wars with Algeria and other NAf states for unification of the Berber regions).  Super Ukraine makes no sense. Split it in 'NATO Novorossia' and join the rest/west with Poland in a federated state (finally reuniting the Ruthenians in one nation, with the Poles).  Without Russia around, Moldova will reunite with Romania except for Transdniestria, which should join with 'NATO Novorossia'.  Caucasus: without Russian support again, either Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh (in its current de facto borders) will combine and annex about a third of Azerbaijan in the process, or Turkey will come to their ""nephews"" aide and finish the Armenian genocide, wiping N-K from the map and creating a muslim corridor to Azerbaijan's exclave over (depopulated) Armenian soil. Unless it's made part of the 'NATO Caucasus'.  Cyprus: for Albania to complete its conquest of Serbian land and outright annex Kosovo, this means Europe has completely become irrelevant (even more than it is now) and cannot protect any borders. North Cyprus will become recognised independent, perhaps even conquering the south and finishing what Turkey started in 1974.  Serbia and 'Srpska' might join, but will likely lose Vojvodina to Hungary. Montenegro will be annexed back as well. In response, Croatia will claim the rest of Bosnia. Perhaps the muslim Bosniaks will be expelled to Greater Albania?  In a Europe that allows an independent Basque state and Catalonia, Scotland will become free and at least a good part of Ulster will finally be allowed to reunite with Ireland.  Belgium is unlikely to exist in this world. Most likely scenario is an 'independent' Flanders, and Wallonia joining with France. Brussels will either go with Wallonia, either as an exclave of 'France' or with a land corridor through Halle-Villevoorde (which are Frenchifying anyway, like Brussels has) -- or it will be an ""independent"" capital state of a powerless EU.  Speaking of Catalonia, Valencia will not be a part of it. Either both will become independent, or Valencia will remain in Spain.  Spain will get Gibraltar, but lose Ceuta and Mellilla to the muslims.  Italy is more likely to split in half, than just the island of Sicily. Basically the old split between 'Naples and Sicily' and the rest, with Rome possibly going either way.  Edit: Forgot to add ex-Yugoslavian Macedonia. Unlikely to exist, since Bulgaria claims they're just West Bulgaria (and they do speak the same language), and Greece considers it an affront that Skopje claims the name. Plus, the Albanians claim parts of it. I can't see this survive unless Serbia 'protects' it."
imaginarymaps,2uwiki,hovercraft_of_eels,3,Thu Feb 5 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"but will likely lose Vojvodina to Hungary   Hungary is not likely to ever get more territory because it has claims on literally all of its neighbors which means each and every one of them would act to prevent this. Also not much of Vojvodina is a Hungarian majority area which means that it wouldn't really be a take the whole thing deal.   Perhaps the muslim Bosniaks will be expelled to Greater Albania   The only thing they have in common is that they're muslims. Bosniaks and Albanians don't have any really overlapping claims, but other than that they're not exactly geared to wanting to live together.   ex-Yugoslavian Macedonia...Bulgaria claims they're just West Bulgaria (and they do speak the same language)   That's kinda true, in the same sense that Croatians and Serbs speak the same language, which means they have independent standards and I even think differing Cyrillic alphabets. Albanian claims would be the biggest issue as Albanians regularly cause problems to the Macedonians and occasionally rise up in a revolt of sorts.  I'd also like to point out how the division of Russia is rather random and strange.  First of the Baltic states. Unless the plan is to ethnically cleanse the land they get from Russia they wouldn't want it. Lithuania said no to Kaliningrad to avoid having more Russians in it and Estonia and Latvia already have more Russians than they'd ever care to have. I don't see them claiming more Russians.  I agree on the point of Ukraine never expanding east. They've already lost Novorossiya and the most they can hope for now is to possibly reclaim it which will entail ethnic cleansing. Crimea reverting to Ukraine would also probably lead to a mass exodus of Russians fearful of Ukrainian revenge.  The Caucasus region is basically that crazy Emirate and it's plausible extent wise, but not really feasible. It'd quickly degenerate into an Islamic State 2.0 as soon as foreign troops left.  The issue with the division of the rest of Russia is that, unlike the Soviet Union, it's largely ethnically Russian. They'd oppose such a division by whatever armed force they had available.  I'd think that perhaps having the ethnic republics of Russia as independent and maybe enlarged would be a more legitimate scenario."

If you're interested, look up the case from the 'Prussian Trust' (descendants of German expellees) against Poland in the European Court of Human Rights from 2006. The Trust lost because the EU refused to rule on it, declaring the case inadmissible since those laws were in the Polish books before Poland joined the EU.  As for Russian East Prussia (Kaliningrad Oblast) itself, after 1991 some Germans were allowed to return there, but only those that already held Russian citizenship for some reason. Large parts of it remain at least nominally military territory which means that non-Russians are forbidden from even entering. And like I posted, I doubt Poland would be happy with even a small part of what used to be Germany until 1945 returning to it..."

I stood sometime in /r/Futurewhatif and will stay for a lot of time because i love futurology and geopolitics, the basic fallacies that i heard are:  EAST ASIA:   North and South Korea will not be united unless some major warfare happens :(  North and South Korea are heavily divided by culture, language, thoughts (brainwashing results), and ideology, if Korea suddenly united under ROC control, the ROC would have to pay unimaginable amounts of money for repair, nutrition of starving citizens, and modernization of the territory, as well as the Southern citizens would refuse to live in the newly-annexed North because of the legacy of terror that the WPK's reign of murders, famine, human experimentation, and torture left in those areas.  A more fictional version, but ""not too fictional"" of Korean Reunification under DPRK control would MAYBE be this one in my map (but that's not what i am intending!), where the DPRK fully becomes China's bitch, and reforms its economical system, as well as becoming more open, if they succeed on being a more successfull economy than the ROC, we could see a fully united ""communist"" Korea, here in my map a new ""Race for Berlin"" happened, North Korea's govt collapses, either China or the ROC have to hurry their asses up to Pyongyang to assume place before anyone else.  North Korea is still propped up by China, while South Korea has become much more self-sustaining. Any unification will happen under the South or under China (let's hope not). - /u/adamwizzy.  China and Taiwan have been pushing for reunification for the following 20 years, and it will be completely peaceful, China will also be less authoritarian and liberal as time goes by.  We will never see Tibet independent, they are unable to survive alone by themselves, even with dozens of foreign support they'd still live as a stuck-in-time Kingdom that is with a ""CHINA, KICK ME!"" sign in his back.  The maximum that they could do would be to Unify with Tibet and Nepal to form a modern-day, industrialized Buddhist kingdom that would 24/7 rely on India.   MIDDLE EAST:   We might only see Kurdistan on the Iraqi and Syrian soil, Turkey in no fucking way wants to lose territory, same with Iran, i even heard on some post that Turkey's reason of leaving NATO was to invade Kurdistan and get rid of them.   AMERICAS?????   Cuba man..... what the fuck did i just do?

imaginarymaps,2udms8,TheMightyGoatMan,6,Sun Feb 1 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"EDIT: And here's an updated version after some feedback.  The Metro 2033 series of novels are huge in Russia and Eastern Europe, but only two of them (Metro 2033 and Metro 2034), have been translated into English. The maps provided in the translations aren't great, and there's a vast amount of information from the 50+ novels in the series that isn't included. This is my attempt at collating what information is available online and making a map that's useful to English readers.  Problems with making the map...  1: The series is set in the Moscow Metro system 20 years after a nuclear holocaust that happened in 2013. However the first book was written in 2002 and the Metro map in that book is clearly based on the Metro as it was in 2002. In the real world, between 2002 and 2013 a bunch of new stations were opened and a new section of line built. So should the map stay true to the first book, or should it be updated to reflect the real Metro of 2013?  2: Metro 2033 has are two separate continuities - that of the books, and that of the spinoff computer games. Should the map be based on the books, or on the games, or try to cover both?  3: There are now about 50 books in the Metro 2033 series written by various authors. A bunch of these are set in other cities, but several are still set in the Moscow Metro. Only two of the books (Metro 2033 and Metro 2034) have been translated into English, meaning there’s a whole lot of detail out there that’s only partially available to a monolingual English speaker such as myself.  4: Varying translations, the habit of the Russian authorities to change station names seemingly on a whim and the differing station names used by factions within the setting (hello Red Line!) make coming up with standard names for each station a freakin’ nightmare.  My solutions…  1: Base the map on the 2002 Metro and only add extra stations/lines if I can find evidence that they’ve been explicitly included in the books.  2: Base the map on the books, and include information from the computer games only where it doesn’t cause conflicts.  3: Get info from the two English books and trawl around online for any other scraps I can find - in particular from the ‘Universe of Metro 2033’ page on Wikipedia. Google translate has been particularly helpful in this respect.  4: Use station names from Metro 2034 (which is a lot better translated than Metro 2033) where available, otherwise come up with a name based on the examples from Metro 2034, and provide an index of station names.  My final map is probably not right, but it’s the best I can do and (I hope) is better than a lot of other English maps floating around out there.  Comments and criticisms welcome!"
imaginarymaps,2udms8,Hellerick,3,Sun Feb 1 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"As a Russian I must say that the names chosen for the stations are very interesting -- they seem to be good adaptations for an English speaker.  The purpose of the right table is not clear, it seems weird that many stations are listed twice (or thrice). Does it attempt to list all possible names for the stations? Probably it would be better to have a table of ""Russian name - Map name"" correspondences."
imaginarymaps,2udms8,Hellerick,3,Sun Feb 1 05:08:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I spent a lot of time on the station names, I'm glad to hear a Russian approve :)  There is a bit of redundancy in the index. The idea was that you can start from any station name, either Russian or an English translation, and easily find it on the map. For instance I've seen Проспект Мира translated in five or six different ways (Prospect Mir, Mira Prospect, Peace Prospect, etc.), so I included them all so someone could find it regardless of what translation they're reading."
imaginarymaps,2udms8,danouki,4,Sun Feb 1 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"But why ""Park Kultury"" became ""Culture Park"", and ""Park Pobedy"" did not become ""Victory Park""? Because such name was not used in the books?  The station Bagrationovskaya is named after Bagration, not Bagrationov. The latter name was chosen to avoid it being pronounced ""bagraishen""?  The name Shchyolkovo looks more scary than it could. I would use Scholkovo here.  Unfortunately there is no standard romanization system for Russian, and every time you have to come with a system that suits your current purpose. I once made a system titled ""Bad Romanization of Russian"" a purpose like yours: to render the Russian names for in English speakers in a 'least scary' way, with words being short, without confusing letter combinations etc. Well, since you use names from a book I suppose you don't need, I'm I am just bragging."
imaginarymaps,2udms8,danouki,3,Sun Feb 1 05:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's not bragging, it's actually that's exactly the kind of feedback I need!  I did my best to track down the meaning of each station name but obviously missed a few - in particular I have no idea how I missed that ""Pobedy"" is ""Victory"".  I'll correct Victory Park, Bagration, and Scholkovo on version two of the map. Are there any other glaring errors that jump out to you?"

imaginarymaps,2ubtso,Super_Deeg,15,Sat Jan 31 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"This is a ctrl+c ctrl+v of the story i wrote about my self-made map from some months ago:  TMIHC Is divided into several stories, its characters are very normal people living in the daily life of america the world under fascism, it was one of the first Axis Victory fiction to be ever released, in '62, first, let's go to the backstory.  In this universe, Giuseppe Zangara successfully murdered Franklin D. Roosevelt in his original attacks in 1933, how?, because he didn't had a Zippo Lighter in his pocket that probably would have stopped the bullets This led to the weak governments of John Nance Garner (formerly FDR's VP-elect), and later of the Republican John W. Bricker in 1941. Both politicians failed to surmount the Great Depression, and maintained the country's isolationist policy against participating in the Second World War; thus, the U.S. had insufficient military capabilities to assist the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, or to defend itself against Japan in the Pacific.  In 1941, the Nazis conquered Stalingrad completely, and then exterminated most of its Slavic peoples; the few whom they allowed to live were confined to reservations, while Hitler was now putting his Lebensraum policy in effect in all German-occupied areas. In the Pacific, the Japanese destroyed the entire U.S. Navy fleet in a decisive, definitive attack on Pearl Harbor; thereafter, the superior Japanese military conquered Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand and Oceania ehh, in order to end the USSR completely, Japan and Germany launched a joint attack in the provisional Soviet capital in the Urals from both East and West Siberia, killing all Soviet leaders and leading to its surrender. ""Years of Peace"" afterwards, the Axis Powers, each attacking from opposite fronts, invaded and conquered the coastal United States, and, by 1947, the United States and other remaining Allied forces surrendered to the Axis.  Japan established the puppet Pacific States of America out of the West Coast of the US and South America as the Greater East Asian and Pacific Co-Prosperity Sphere. The remaining Mountain, Great Plains and Southwestern states became the Rocky Mountain States, a buffer between the PSA and the remaining USA, now a Nazi puppet state in the style of Vichy France, Hitler did not changed the name of occupied america to something else, as he belives that America was ""Corrupted by Jews and Negroes"", and now he is going to take ""America back to its roots"".  Having won, the Third Reich and Imperial Japan became the resultant superpowers of their world and consequently embarked upon a Cold War against themselves, this time of course, Dick portrayed them as much more aggressive against each other instead of the US vs. USSR Cold War in our timeline, with actual attacks being mentioned sometimes. One of the core narrative elements (Operation Dandelion) is centered on a preemptive Nazi nuclear strike on the Japanese Home Islands. The Nazis have the prototype ""hydrogen bomb"" and the ability to wipe out the Home Islands, while Japan announces it is also building their Nuclear Program, mainly from captured soviet equiment,The Axis' nuclear energy capabilities also fuel extremely fast air travel and the colonization of the moon, Venus, and Mars.  After Hitler supposedly dies of syphilis, Martin Bormann, as Nazi Party Chancellor, assumes power as Führer of Germany. Bormann proceeds to create a colonial empire to increase Germany's Lebensraum with the Atlantropa Project (that never occurred in our timeline), using Germany's technology, they drain the Mediterranean Sea and convert it into a colossal farmland, uniting the European continent with Africa, so Arthur Seyss-Inquart can oversee the colonization of the newly-created continent (New Germannia) to exterminate blacks and ""Fill Africa with Aryans"".  Meanwhile, the Reich sends spaceships to colonize Mars and other parts of the Solar System, which of course also starts a Space Race against Japan. Soon after the novel begins, Führer Bormann dies, initiating an internal power struggle between Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Hermann Göring, and other top Nazis to succeed him as Reichskanzler. That's about it, the rest are massive spoilers so i can't continue, the book is divided by several stories, each of them have their own protagonists, personality, objectives, ideology (i.e. pro or anti-axis), and backstory, the maximum example that i can give is the Character Nobosuke Nagomi, a trade missioner in Sokoku (San Francisco) who is just doing his job, the book focuses on the normal lives of these people, it's pretty interesting."

The region surrounding Perth is mostly agricultural. The rest of WA is predominantly mining.  The Uluru state covers indigenous communities in the remote desert regions of Australia, rather than having the desert split between states.  All the major cities are their own state (Swan, Spencer, Yarra, Cumberland and Moreton) as services tend to predominate their workforce and industry, rather than agriculture and mining elsewhere. The interests of city-dwellers differ from those living in rural or regional areas.  The state of Murray unites the agricultural areas along the Murray River from SA, VIC and NSW. Monaro covers the coastal areas as industries differ - forestry is more prominent - and cities are somewhat larger. This rationale is similar to that of splitting Barwon and Hunter. Barwon is also climatically different to Murray and Hunter.  Don't take this too seriously, I was just having a bit of fun. Looking at the map, there's a lot that I would reconsider."

imaginarymaps,2tq5y9,JimeDorje,15,Tue Jan 27 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know WHAT'S going on with New England maps recently, but ugh, this is wrong on so many levels barring some sort of ""After the End"" type scenario.    Grand Isle County, VT is uncolored as it was annexed by Canada following the Schism.   Totally fine... I guess. I don't really get how Vermont is basically unscathed from its territorial redistribution with the exception of a tiny piece being annexed by Canada. Honestly, if Canada were to annex an island just like that, they'd start exerting influence, territorial sort, on New England. They'd make claims to northern Maine, pieces of New Hampshire, and probably a large swath of Vermont anyway (French speaking and whatever). So while I guess it could make sense if we bend the geopolitical situation, I don't see it happening without other cartographic consequences.    Massachusetts, an economic and military powerhouse, was able to project influence over large portions of the I-95 corridor and Greater Boston. Western Massachusetts was largely abandoned by the state given the high cost of upkeep and low return.   So while this makes sense to have a sort of ""Tri-State Area"" for Boston like New York has, it wouldn't mean full annexation into MA state. It would involve a MASSIVE bureaucratic overhaul that would be way more costly than maintaining the sparsely populated western MA. That said, New Hampshire won't lose its most populous city (Manchester) and capital (Concord) without a fight. And by fight, I mean civil freakin' war. And it'd basically be all the states vs. Boston, which is a war that Massachusetts cannot win. As much of a powerhouse as Boston may be, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and even Maine will consider what it could mean if Boston is allowed to just take away their primary tax bases. In the event that Boston wins (say Canadian or New Yorker intervention) then sure this sort of redistribution is possible, but not in the manner that ends with extra New Hampshire claims in other states' territory.   And if the other five states beat Boston into a pulp (through guerilla warfare driving morale in Boston extremely low) then New England's best case scenario is a confederation of military alliance, certainly not any sort of Federalized state.   Basically, NH ain't giving up Concord of Manchester without blood being spilled.    These counties then successfully petitioned the Connecticut government for their protection.   While I could totally see Boston abandoning its responsibility by letting the Berkshires go, I fail to see how Connecticut is going to suddenly accept that responsibility. ESPECIALLY if Boston is citing budget concerns. Connecticut is never any better off than Boston is financially, so Hartford isn't going to accept that responsibility. Best case scenario, they form their own Commonwealth of Berkshire.    The Rhode Island government enjoys a Taiwan-like state of existence on Block Island. The mega-rich who occupied the state avoid annexation by Massachusetts through their connections and financial resources. Rhode Island enjoys a strong connection with the Manhattan Enclave.   This is ridiculous. If the rich and powerful on Block Island (which makes no sense, those are mostly vacation homes) are able to keep off Bostonian invasion through just political and financial connections, then it's enough to keep mainland Rhode Island independent as well.   I'm getting hung up on this ""Boston releases W. Mass because they don't want to spend the money, but they're willing to annex huge swaths of RI and NH."" Makes no sense. Especially since the areas Boston annexed are no more (and in many places, much MUCH less) developed than the area they just let go. Massachusetts isn't saving any money in this world (especially if you factor in that expensive war).    Vermont retained the vast majority of its territory throughout the crisis. The Green Mountains made potential enemies think twice before attempting land seizures. As mentioned though, Grand Isle was lost to Canada.   Yep, made the enemies think twice, except Canada. Why does Vermont have so many balls but New Hampshire and Maine so few?    New Hampshire reluctantly ceded most of its Southern territories to Massachusetts choosing to focus on its claim over the entirety of the White Mountains which branch into Maine. This move was not well received by native Mainers.   Yea, again, already broached with the civil war above. New Hampshire isn't going to care about the White Mountains in this world. They're pitiful replacements for the tax base in Manchester and Concord (pennies in the bucket for Boston, but bread and butter for New Hampshire).    Maine acts as more of a confederation of groups. It has retained its capital in Augusta (Kennebec County) which has the added effect of making it a fortified city as it sits a mere 50 miles from the increasingly hostile New Hampshire holdings in Franklin and Oxford.

imaginarymaps,2tq5y9,zakii,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"Before that, I'd like to address your assumption that each state has full agency over it's pre-Schism (aka Divide) borders as that is a poor mindset to have when looking at this map.  Imagine the US operating less as the tight-knit federally moderated body of states which form a nation and think of the post-Schism USA as a union of countries with their own interests and goals. As the EU exists today, the USA exists in this universe (with some significant differences).  Even before the PoD that caused the Schism, Western MA and ""Boston"" MA had significant differences. Culturally this is evident in our world as many Western MA residents feel more association with New York (City) than Boston. Financially, the Western counties contribute far less in taxes than they cost and, even in matters of geography, the landscape is significantly different.   None of this, mind you, answers your question. It does, however, create the frame of mind one must have going into the Post-Schism redistribution.  Some time after the Divide, a conference was held in Trenton. The attendees represented states from New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and parts of the Midwest and central southern States. The result of this conference, the Trenton Accords, combined, created, and dissolved several political entities that had emerged as a result of the Schism. New England was one of the regions that saw the least amount of change - but not for lack of desire. Rather, the compromises made heavily favored economic powerhouses with large population bases. As such, the representatives from these areas, Boston among them, commanded the most power.  The case made was that many residents in neighboring areas, the counties annexed, were de facto residents of Massachusetts. Case aside, the result was the absorption of several major population centers in New Hampshire and Rhode Island further strengthening MA influence. This concept, introduced as ""real residents"" set the tone for the talks ahead.  Massachusetts garnered a good deal of support from the residents of southern NH who sought greater protection, as well as representation, in such uncertain times.   The proposal to annex Rhode Island, while not wholly unendorsed by the RI representation was supported by Connecticut representatives. In return for their support, Boston MA supported the latter-proposed compromise for Western MA's absorption by CT.   Does that make sense to you? As I said, it might be easier if you had more specific clarifiers."
imaginarymaps,2tq5y9,Wittgenfine,0,Tue Jan 27 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"Does that make sense to you?   No, it still doesn't. My original points stand. Specifically:    The proposal to annex Rhode Island, while not wholly unendorsed by the RI representation was supported by Connecticut representatives. In return for their support, Boston MA supported the latter-proposed compromise for Western MA's absorption by CT.   As much claim could be made by MA that CT is just as much a ""de facto"" client of Boston as much as southern NH and RI are. CT, indeed, NO political entity that wasn't short of collapse in and of itself, would seek annexation by a higher power while other options still presented themselves. In this case, NH would still have the other New England states to lean on (safety in numbers) in the light of Boston's growing influence. To prevent the alarming precedent of Boston just straight up annexing whatever area is ""de facto"" theirs, is worth it alone to stop Boston's annexation of RI or NH. Even if the residents of Concord and Manchester (hell, even RI) supported it, VT, CT, and ME would band together in a coalition to stop it.    Boston MA supported the latter-proposed compromise for Western MA's absorption by CT.   I still don't understand this part. Boston lets the western half of their state go because it costs more money to upkeep than it's worth. But then annexes a vastly larger and in many areas, less developed? Regardless of what state or country this is, I still don't understand the logic at play here.    Massachusetts garnered a good deal of support from the residents of southern NH who sought greater protection, as well as representation, in such uncertain times.   What's going on in New Hampshire? Why do the residents of Concord and Manchester have so little faith in their own state? Indeed, why would Concord suddenly decide that their own autonomy isn't worth it and they'd rather be a suburb of Boston? That said, why didn't the rest of that state follow? Who/what government decided that the concept of ""New Hampshire"" was worth keeping around and that they had not only a legitimate claim, but the power to enforce that claim on Maine? If times are ""uncertain"" who or what pulled that off?    This concept, introduced as ""real residents"" set the tone for the talks ahead.   So... Massachusetts is like China? While I love painting Boston as Beijing, I'm still not sure why they would abandon a region already under their control (Western Mass) as ""not real residents"" but accept Rhode Island or Concord. You can hope on a train and commute to a job in Worcester, but you'd still have to drive across state lines and separate road jurisdictions to commute to Providence.    Some time after the Divide, a conference was held in Trenton.   This is fine. Why Trenton, though?    New England was one of the regions that saw the least amount of change - but not for lack of desire. Rather, the compromises made heavily favored economic powerhouses with large population bases. As such, the representatives from these areas, Boston among them, commanded the most power.   Granted, most conferences like this favor population bases. That doesn't mean thing like land redistribution haven't had real world consequences. If Boston divides up their sphere of influence along these lines, it's not going to be pretty. Especially with ""times so uncertain,"" namely: rebellious governments in New Hampshire, independent-minded Vermonters, Block Island financial cliques (as little sense as it makes, I actually like the idea of a wealthy off-limits, high class division Block Island that controls political decisions made in Boston), and confused budget analysts in Hartford and Boston.    It does, however, create the frame of mind one must have going into the Post-Schism redistribution.   Very true. My questions still remain largely unanswered. There don't seem to be a lot of logic in the Trenton Accords' decisions to redistribute land jurisdiction in New England.    Before that, I'd like to address your assumption that each state has full agency over it's pre-Schism (aka Divide) borders as that is a poor mindset to have when looking at this map.   And while I'm fine with this, again, those decisions will have consequences. Consequences that will lose people a lot of money and power, and will resort to war that will make this map very temporary."

The amount of fracturing of society that would cause parts of New England to vie for dominance over each other would have to be so catastrophic that identities based on statehood, or even cities, would have evaporated long ago. New Englanders, like virtually all Americans, are extremely homogenous. We wouldn't hold violent conflict with each other barring a complete breakdown of civilization and at least a generation without the uniting force of a salient nationhood to make conflict unthinkable.

imaginarymaps,2tq5y9,Adventurenauts,2,Mon Jan 26 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"What? I'm American.    Then you must be using a different idea of ""homogeneity"" than I am. Americans are highly varied. Just the cultural differences within New England are incredibly staggering. Northern Vermont speaks French as a second (and sometimes first) language, as does northern Maine. Both areas are incredibly rural and oftentimes culturally conservative, but not always. That said, Burlington is basically the eastern hipster capital (Portland is the western capital). Vermonters and New Hampshire-ites are similar structurally (with the demographics reversed because of the states' physical structures, Vermont has a higher Francophone population, New Hampshire has bigger cities on the border and coast w/ Mass. etc.) but have two different cultures. You can compare plenty of election maps with VT and NH on opposing sides.   Southern New England is a different animal entirely. From Boston all the way down the coast to New York there is very much a division between the urban, industrialized, and immigrant-excessive cities such as Boston and Bridgeport, and then there is the less densely populated coastal properties of the wealthy - both a division of old and new money (though usually a division of history, few if any I've met in this demographic really care if your money was trust-funded or earned on the internet) in places such as Old Saybrook or Greenwich, CT, Block Island, RI, or to a lesser degree (and arguably a cultural anomaly) Provincetown, MA. And then there really is a rural, back-woodsy demographic that is largely conservative (whereas the other two are very liberal, while northern New England's rural demographic still tends to vote liberal, if at a much milder margin) and outpaced by urban (black, Hispanic, and European immigrants) growth.   Hell, there's huge divides within the urban areas. Boston has Harvard and Southie (the Good Will Hunting divide). Hartford has Trinity and West (Hartford). Bridgeport has the University and (had) Father Panik Village. New Haven has Yale and... the rest of New Haven.   The source of these divisions (hell, just in Connecticut) starts way back when the country was founded. Massachusetts and Connecticut were both founded more or less as religious refuges for English Puritan settlers. And Rhode Island (always New England's black sheep) was settled as a refuge from those refugees. Hell, Rhode Island wasn't even officially sure they wanted Independence until after the war was over.   Compare Hertford and Boston's original locations in England. They were settled by two different locations, two different accents, and two different cultures. And then compare where Vermonters, New Hampshireites, and Mainers originally came from and the cultural differences started from the beginning of the era (and keep in mind this is the day before modern communications, when people living two counties away were as culturally different as people living on opposite ends of the country). New York and New England have two totally different cultures, and this can be seen by crossing the border from New Haven to New York (SW CT is culturally New Yorker for reasons mentioned below) or sailing across the lake from VT to NY.   In 1860, at the start of the Civil War, CT only had a half million people. That's eight times as many as she has today. What happened? Post-War booms happened, and land was dirt cheap in Connecticut. All of those old and unprofitable formerly Congregationalist farms (the Congregationalist Church was probably the single most powerful group in Connecticut for generations, I've been told that you couldn't vote in CT without being a Congregationalist, but I have yet to confirm this) were sold as high priced real-estate for rising middle class business men who wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of New York City and enjoy leisure similar to what many of them saw in their time in England. We all wanted to be our own little English manor lords. Many (I'd argue to say MOST) of these people were the descendants of Ellis Island immigrants who settled in New York City in the opening of the century. Mainly (if my High School demographics are to be believed) Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrants. This shifted Connecticut's (if not New England's as a whole) demographics from decidedly Protestant, to uniquely Catholic. Hartford is only Hartford because those same businessmen figured they could have cheaper and shorter commutes, and a larger option of living areas by moving businesses to Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven rather than staying in New York City. This is part of the reason why Connecticut is largely suburban sprawl (or in-fill) and has lost much of its 19th Century rural charm that can still be seen in parts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Or northwestern Connecticut if you look hard enough.   More recent waves of immigrants - especially black American immigrants from the south, and Puerto Ricans - have moved on north and settled in CT, mainly in the cities (Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport) just repeating the cycle of organized crime to demographic shift. The main differences being the Puerto Rican are Catholic, while the black Americans are Protestant. They're conservative cultures that tend to vote decidedly liberal.   Anyway, I got a little carried away here, but this is just a breakdown of New Englander cultural differences, and mostly within Connecticut itself since it's what I know best. Now, you can argue that these divisions take place in any society (sure, someone can come in here and dismantle New Yorker, or Dixie, or Texan, or Californian, or Hawaiian, or what have you, in fact I welcome it) in the same exact divisions - east/west, north/south, educated/provincial, urban/rural, Catholic/Protestant - but that's kind of my point. New England is far from ""homogenous."" And America is even less so. Hell, I can identify huge divisions in societies that most deem even MORE homogenous and conformist than America (South Korea, China, Japan. I currently live in the first, which after talking with people back home, many Americans assume is a homogenous, monochromatic society) and while they all sort of come back to the same divisions (east/west, north/south, yada yada...) the fact remains the same that no two differences are alike and each difference makes neighboring societies heterogenous.   One thing is for certain, and it's that in OP's timeline, the United States has fallen on some hard times and Americans have fallen back on local identities of various loyalties. It seems as though New England figured six states are stronger than one, and banded together into a federalized union with Boston as the main source of power. Yet, based on what admittedly little information OP grants us, it appears that money is still the main factor (it always is) and Boston basically bullies the other states into stealing their main tax bases (Connecticut seemed to get away all right though) without actually destroying the states and centralizing their administration out of Boston. Now, people have killed for a lot less. And wars have been started by ""more homogenous"" groups than exist between the difference that exists between New Hampshireites and Beantowners.   tl;dr, 300 million people are not ""homogenous."" Especially when you factor education, history, politics, and of course money."
imaginarymaps,2tq5y9,cwmma,0,Tue Jan 27 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"You completely missed my point. The homogeneity is superficial, yes, but enough that we wouldn't break down into regional (especially not state) identities because the American identity is far more salient than any other. Fine, if there were major demographic differences between states there could be a breakdown of nationhood, but there aren't. Two middle aged, middle class, suburban white guys on the east coast and west coast are still going to have a lot more in common than, say, an inner city latino guy that has a totally different lifestyle, but only lives a couple of miles away.  My entire point from the beginning would that it would have to be an extreme case and then a generation who hasn't grown up thinking this way for there ever to be regional breakup. Any collapse of the normal order that would otherwise leave society mostly intact would just lead to a similar government and society, it just might behave differently."

First, there was never a real separatist movement in the state (unless internet people yelling counts as one). This idea comes from the 32 Revolution, which wasn't seeking independence from Brazil, as many history books say. This conflict was also known as the Constitutional Revolution, because the state's elite was unhappy with the lack of constitution and demanded one from the ""President"", who spread propaganda claiming Sao Paulo wanted to become independent to make the troops lose the support they had of the rest of the country. There were a couple of people that argued for separatism, but it was never a real thing, with actual support. The flag they used in battle (and still do) has Brazil's map on it, for crying out loud.  Second, Brazil would have to be almost completely divided to actually represent all the separatism movements we had. In fact, most of them were a lot stronger than Sao Paulo, including a state that actually separated for a while in the north (Para), and several failed but major revolts (Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambuco). The Brazilian territory would actually be a lot like the rest of South America, a bunch of little countries that share a language."

One of these states splintering from formerly Communist China was the Yanbian Republic.   Today jokingly referred to as ""the Real North Korea"" (while referencing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as ""Central Korea"") the Republic of Yanbian is on friendly terms with all of its neighbors and nearby states. The Federal States of China and the Russian Federation are more than happy to encourage their native Korean minorities to migrate to Yanbian just to further their own ideas of racial purity in their own countries. Yanbian, at just under three million, is one of north Asia's smallest countries, even smaller than the DPRK who has made threatening remarks about ""uniting all former Joseon lands.""   These sorts of comments are run of the mill for the Republic of Korea, but the weak and nearly defenseless (and democratically elected) government of Yanbian had to take Central Korea's threats seriously. South Korea came to the rescue announcing, ""Any attack on our families in Yanbian will be considered a new beginning of hostilities and will lead to immediate action from the south."" Thankfully, (for Yanbian's physical safety, that is) famine and the death of Kim Sung-il put an end to Central Korean threats to Yanbian. Since the famine, both Seoul and Yanji have spent millions in food subsidies to aid Central Korea. Presidents of both South and North have announced, ""The government of Pyongyang is our enemy. Not our brothers, sisters, and cousins trapped under their rule.""   There has been frequent discussion about a union between North and South Korea, but Presidents from both countries have expressed both its eventuality, and its necessary postponement, ""The Republic of Yanbian is a landlocked country,"" Yanbian President Kim Hyun-jun said, ""South Korea is basically an island. We have modeled all of our systems and programs to be just like Seoul's to make reunion as bureaucratically smooth and clean as possible."" President Kim's Democratic Reunionist Party won majority reelections in 2007 and 2012. The United States feels confident that a unified Korea (from three countries into one) would be a stabilizing force in the region. Japan and China, for their part, are not so sure and are convinced that a united Korea would work to monopolize markets both nations are keen on keeping."

Kurdistan is an interesting and certainly plausible byproduct as well, though I'm skeptical that they would have the clout to take Kurdish territory from Turkey.  I'd like to know the artist's rationale for the Islamic Sacred State and the apparent collapse of Saudi Arabia - was the monarchy overthrown? What's the story there? Similarly I am aware that Baluchistan historically has been it's own tribal region, but what circumstances made it a sovereign state?

Secondly, Yeman will probably be divided into North and South for Zaydis and Sunnis respectively.   Thirdly, I can see a Shia Arab union which will also include Bahrain and stretches to Baghdad but I don't see it taking any territory from Iran at all.   Fourthly, the division of Iran is highly unlikely even in the event of a huge revolt.   Fifthly, Kurdistan will be confined to Iraqi and Syrian regions, Turkey is not a pushover.   Finally, in the event of a division of the Iraqi state and if Assad falls then a union between Sunni Iraq and Syria is likely. Syria lose of territory to Lebanon isn't realistic."

That said, I don't think it's likely that a state would be able to call itself Sunni or Shia without displacing large, indigenous communities of the other. I think religious extremism is too inherently unstable to form a lasting state - eventually people will want to settle down and have kids.

imaginarymaps,2t7hcy,gerradynn,5,Wed Jan 21 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"I started this map of an unnamed city right around 10 or so years ago and have been drawing or otherwise editing it ever since. The original post is just a quick picture of one incredibly tiny part of this map. I want to find a way to upload it so others can see it, but I am not sure how I would turn the whole thing into a digital copy. It is massive, too massive. This link takes you to another photo, and consequently the album I made for whatever I try to do with this so you can kind of see how big this map is.  It is drawn on some sort of large roll of paper I think used in some commercial copy machines, about 11 inches wide and somewhere well over 150 feet long.  It is old, not very well drawn (I may be a little more harsh about it than I should be) and lacks any key or explanation. Maybe you guys could help me figure out how I could put all of this together so I could show you all what I have spent half my life working on. I know it is far from perfect by any measure. It lacks a consistent scale and is not always bound to logic and common sense (I did start drawing this when I was around 10 to 12). I decided that as I would edit it I would not, if I could help it, make drastic changes which otherwise marred the original design. I only wanted to edit to have things make more sense, or have streets and intersections laid out more efficiently.  *Ninja edit: messed up the link formatting."
imaginarymaps,2t7hcy,Kallisti13,5,Wed Jan 21 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"I may have slightly over exaggerated the length of this a bit. I think it was a little closer to just 100 feet long. I scanned it all, and the album I made earlier will have all of the scans loaded into it. Also, the much larger spliced images are on Copy. I could not make one single map file out of it. I tried. My computer cried, then Blue Screened, then cried some more as I tried to put everything back in place. So you get three files: the first, 45 MB; the second, 100 MB; the third, 80 MB. So be warned they are huge. Also they are vertically aligned, and I tried to fix that but ran out of memory before GIMP could finish rotating them. I'd love to talk more about the map since it has no real clues or other information regarding anything all that is on it, but it is a lot of map. I'll answer questions, and such. I'm just really excited to actually have been able to post this as a whole.  Things I learned from this: * I have absolutely no understanding of how a parking garage should be laid out * I have no consistency in my sense of scale * I spent WAY too long looking at this map, WAY too long. * I have a wildly boring imagination if this is what it produced  Again, I stress that this map is not always logical. I also took inspiration from everything. Spent some time in school learning about alternative forms of energy, namely amongst them, geothermal. So guess what? I drew what is probably an entirely wrong set up for a geothermal powerpoint right in the middle of lower town and practically next door to the City Council Chambers. The town also has a huge bus network, like ridiculously huge with full service stations, in road stations, bus sidings, quick transfer locations, direct interaction with regional mass transit and on and on and on. All of which I decided was needed because of my home town's incredibly inefficient bus network, the bane of my existence during high school and middle school."
imaginarymaps,2t7hcy,knz,3,Thu Jan 22 05:16:26 2015 UTC,I think I'll give that a try. I found a scanner I didn't know I had and will probably end up using that.

The star is something of a pulsar as I recall, the rotation frequency is so I could have them bombarded with radiation now and again. Also, it did contain alien tech - or at least the players detected a strange signal originating from it.

In 1453, King Armand IV of France declared a new religion: Cynicism, which enshrined as ""holy doctrine"" the virtues of ""logic and charity"" holding up classical writings of Plato, Marcus Aurelius, and an altered humanist-inspired version of the Bible, taking Jesus as a secular moral philosopher, rather than a divine figure, as it's new creed. The map above shows the Indo-Aryan tradition or Yurop-Ynde in the year 1453. Below are itemized descriptions of the religions present.   Dharmic Traditions   Dharmic traditions hail from Ynde, and all praise the nature of ""Dharma"" or ""Law"" but is defined differently along religious and cultural lines.   Hinduism (Red)  The indigenous polytheist religion of Ynde remains widely practiced in its native land, but has been reduced to a minority religion. Many of her gods have been converted to Norse ones by the blonde conquerors. But where Hinduism thrives (of the Shaktist variety, especially) is in the Carpathian Basin. The Magyars were once Tengri nomads but after settling in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century, the Magyars began raiding across the world. When a prince Arpad raided into Ynde and brought back a number of Hindu concubines and several yogins, he became intensely interested in this foreign way of life and made several sacrifices to the Hindu gods, converting his Tengri temples into ones devoted to Shakti and Kali. His warriors - not seeing much difference between the new gods of mysterious forms and the old one of the boundless sky - followed his lead as long as they were able to raid around the world. In the 10th and 11th Centuries, the Magyars continued to raid around Yurop, depositing settlers and nomads wherever they went. Magyar language and religion is known throughout Yurop and in 1453, was used as the lingua franca for most of Central Yurop.   Buddhism  (Lighter Orange)  Buddhism first came to Yurop through the Hindu connection in Hungary. The Magyars kept their trade routes through the Turkish lands of Tartaria and eventually came into contact with Buddhist monks and ascetics, bringing them to Yurop with them. The Buddhists made few converts in Carpathia, but soon found plenty of adherents in the religiously chaotic (and politically defunct) Greek Empire. South-eastern Yurop is mainly Buddhist of the Hinayana variety. When the Mongols came through Tartaria and landed in Anatolia, they adopted the native Hinayana tradition. The ancient church of Saint Sofia was converted into a Buddhist monastery and remains so today. The Cynics would travel there to learn and debate philosophy with the Buddhists. In fact, after the Norse destruction of Nalanda, Sofia became the world's largest center of Buddhist learning. All three traditions (Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana) were taught at Sofia, as well as a dozen languages (including Magyar, Sanskrit, Pali, Mongol, Greek, and Latin).  Later in the 13th Century, when King Ihar the Great was wounded in battle and healed by a passing Vajrayana monk, he converted his Kingdom to this influential and powerful faith, turning all of the native temples to Buddhist temples and monasteries. Estonia, in this map's depiction, shows Estonia as the largest Vajrayana realm, though by this time, the Adamantine Vehicle was spreading to Svi∂jod and the mountains of Scandinavia. The Romuva temples of the Baltic were also being destroyed in favor of Buddhist temples.   In Ynde, where Buddhism was born, the Norse were hard at work destroying the ancient faith: throwing ancient books into the Ganges and burning their temples and monasteries. The Chosen of Ashoka - a militant religious organization that had both celibate and non-celibate ascetics - retreated to their might Tsongs of the Himalayas. The Age of Cynicism also marks a new era of Buddhism, when the Chosen of Ashoka would unleash their own military campaigns to topple the Fylkirate of Ynde, as well as the Tybetan Empire to the north (still following Boon, their native religion, but gaining interest in Buddhism).

imaginarymaps,2syig4,MoralisticCommunist,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Cont'd  Jainism  (Pale Yellow)  Jainism still has a few adherents in its native land, Ynde, though it would be eclipsed quickly by the Norse majority, and the second largest religion, Hinduism. The Jains in Ynde by the 16th Century would be subsumed into the Hindu religious sphere and be regarded as little more than a sect of Hinduism.   However, during the Age of Adventurers, a Jain army (though as ridiculous as that notion was considered at the time) led by a man - the Bull of Rishabha - marched through Persia, raiding and taking what he wanted from the Persian Moslems, before arriving at the banks of the Euphrates and deciding he wanted an Empire for himself. The Bull switched from raiding to conquering and took everything from the base of the Arabian Peninsula, to the Levant, until reaching the borders of the Kingdom of Anatolia and meeting fierce resistance. Moslem mosques were converted to Jain temples and the ""dimmi"" tax was reversed, levied on Moslems in favor of Jain authorities. The Kaba, a Moslem holy site, was converted to a Jain temple where ascetics meditated on the sanctity of life. The Bull also began the tradition of stepping down from his throne at age 50 and becoming a lowly monk from then on. Today the Rishabha Maharajas are the among the richest and most powerful kings in the world.   Monotheist Semetic Traditions  The Semetic people migrated out of Africa some time before the turn of the millenium. They worshipped a single God and have been termed ""monotheists."" Today they are split into several dying sects with one major split taking place at the turn of the millenium (between Jews and Christians) and another a half century later (between the others and the Moslems).   Judaism  (Sky Blue)  This religion survived the fall of the Roman Empire by hiding in the lost areas of society. Jews were known the world over for their ability to survive, many of whom did so in what is now the Kingdom of Sephardad. The Jews became an important part of Visigothic society in the Iberian Peninsula and fought with bravery as the Ummayad Caliphate collapsed to the African Pagans to the south. The Christian Kingdom thought it was receiving a stroke of luck from almighty god when the Moslems fled from what were reported as ""demons, djinn, and worse."" The Africans fought with ferocity and Moslem and Christian fell to their armies. The Jews came in when a general, Davd ben Izrael led the monotheists to victory after victory. Though it took convincing the Rabbis, ben Izrael accepted mass conversion by his soldiers and followers to his faith. After the Visigothic King died childless (his sons all dead in war) ben Izrael was raised to as the King of Sephardad. Their religion and way of life survived in the mountains of northern Iberia where they hope a ""reconquest"" of the peninsula will soon take place. Indeed, this would be a major theme of the Age of Cynicism.   Due to religious chaos in east Africa, the Jews that lived in the highlands of Ethiopia migrated to the lower Nile by 1453.   Christianities  (skin pale for Catholic, darker for Fraticelli, lightest blue for Cathar, mud-gold for Miaphysite)  This Roman mystery cult used to extend from Spain and Britain to Mesopotamia (with even a minority population in China and Ynde). Now it has been reduced to three sects that define the other as mutually heretical. The old Roman Church - Catholic - has been weeded out almost entirely from the Continent, surviving only in occasional small pockets. Usually in mountain hamlets far from population centers. The last bastion of Catholicism is Ireland which maintains a few colonies out of reach of Slavic Britannia in the Scottish Highlands (although the Slavs have their foothold in Ulster County).   Ireland, while it has a King who rules Tara directly, is mostly at the mercy of the Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller, Teutonic Order, Knights of Calatrava, and Knights of Santiago, are all based in their own Irish castles, and vie for control of the royal court, in addition to the Papacy, sitting in exile in the Holy See of Dublin. The King, at this time, is all to eager to capitalize on the ongoing Crusade in the Scottish Highlands to hopefully and eventually get rid of the Crusaders and eventually the Holy Father himself. (King Neil II's plan in 1453 was to use the Holy Orders all at once to attack the Slavs at different points - ex. Calatrava and Santiago from Scotland, Teutons from Wales, Hospitallers from Cornwall, and the Templars from Kent while the King's own army took back northern Ireland. Once Canterbury was retaken, the Papal Court would be moved there and the Holy Orders would divide England amongst themselves, and he would be crowned Emperor Neil I of Britannia, and would begin seeking ways to establish footholds on the Continent for future Irish Emperors to retake the Catholic holy lands... obviously, this ambitious plan would not be seen to completion).   The Cathars were driven out of Aquitaine by a Zoroastrian holy war, and the Catholics of central and eastern Yurop were reduced to a Fraticelli majority of the Rhine Valley. Both of these sects had their own religious hierarchy and heretical beliefs separate from the Catholic Church. They would soon die out with the rise of Cynicism.   Islams  (forest green for Sunni, a bit lighter for Shia)  Islam once extended from Sephardad to Ynde, and from the Volga to Somalia. In 1453, it was reduced to three small dying pockets. Kobenhavn, remained the only stronghold of Islam and would become an influential and powerful city in the Age of Cynicism, as many French scholars would come seeking wisdom from Moslem scholars here. The Danish King who converted was also successful in gaining converts in parts of Germania and Norway. When the Danish Empire broke apart and the Swedes stepped in, the easterners began the process of de-Islamicizing the land and reintroducing the native Norse gods first, and later their unique version of Vajrayana Buddhism. To avoid this declaration of rulership over their lands, the Moslems of the Germanian plains changed to the Shi'a branch of Islam (though it did little to stem Svi∂jod's claim to this area of the world). After so many religious transitions, Germania would become ripe for Cynic conversion in the coming decades.   Cont'd"

King Kamehameha III was to stay as a ceremonial leader of the islands, and his family would continue to hold that position.  The capital city, Honolulu, gets renamed ""Cooktown,"" to commemorate Captain James Cook's death in the islands, and Cook becomes a symbol of the Sandwich Islands.  By the year 1854, the Island Chain becomes a full colony of the British Empire, and becomes a new destination for large, wealthy, British families, as well as entrepreneurs. The rich, fertile land becomes great for the growing of tropical crops, namely pineapple, and the American Dole family founds a successful business there.  The natives of the islands are generally happy under British rule, however, some independence groups start to rise in the 1850's, such as the infamous group known as Hanohano Hana Hawa'ii."

The Aztecs were right on the edge of making the technological and political transition to a state power when Cortez showed up.

Vector graphics are good for drawing metro maps, but I think it's going to take some time to learn how to use the program.  There's a pretty good fantasy map-making program called Campaign Cartographer 3.  It's great for making the types of maps you might find in fantasy novels, and can help you produce maps in a variety of styles.  I'm not sure if that would be the right type of style for you, but some people get pretty good at using this program, as you can see here.  The company also puts out a program called City Designer."

imaginarymaps,2sjalj,stuffmaster1000,8,Fri Jan 16 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"Outside the girl-on-girl flirting extravaganza, the TL;DR premise of the War is that Hitler is killed in 1940, a new, intelligent, patient, not antisemite, and charismatic Führer appears, makes nuclear weapons before the allies, everything is fucked, US refuses to join the war, after an Axis victory, Japan goes apeshit on planning world domination, Germany and the US have no choice but to ally themselves against Japan, meanwhile, Germany is in civil war between the non-antisemite Nazis and antisemite Nazis (could be an equivalent of Wehrmacht vs. SS).  Years after an Axis Victory, in 1983A, Japan goes in step of nuclear war against Germany, the other outside storyline are of the two main Moe protagonists that i don't remember their names, the one i know is the stereotypical i-hate-my-life Goth German girl who goes to a all-girls school camp somewhere in Siberia on the border between Germany and Japan, when she finds a Miku-OC Russian girl who's been hiding there (Why aren't Commies in the Crimea Camp?!?), and then the Yuri begins, no, there are no sex scenes, it's all soft and kawaii as fuck.  What i remember from writing this at midnight (i added more today, tho)  Wareware no Shikō is set in a universe where Adolf Hitler was successfully assassinated in 1940, as Germany slowly became a military rule that was lead by Hitler's higher-ranking Generals temporarily, after the Third Reich was seemingly going to be crushed by the UK, Heinrich Himmler assumed place as Germany's Füher for less than 10 days until he seemingly committed suicide, and in a letter, he begged for the Sturmbannführer and Nuclear Scientist Karlton Gottler (i modeled him after Fegelein and Gunsche), who was in jail after his Jewish heritage was discovered, to assume his place.  Gottler, protected by the Wehrmacht, was released from prison, and was declared the new Füher of Germany, even although being Jewish, Gottler led Germany with an Iron Fist just like Hitler did, however, he was much more effective, intelligent, patient, and mature than Hitler ever was.  Meanwhile, in the chance of replacing leaders, an Anti-Mussolini revolution happened in Italy much sooner knowing that no support would come if a revolution began, Mussolini was replaced and Italy declared war on Germany, with Mussolini fleeing to Germany, but then deported by Gottler's orders, he was then easily executed by Italian rebels.  It was slowly revealed that Gottler was ""not"" an antisemite, or racist. Unlike Hitler, Gottler did not invaded Russia, instead, he focused fully on taking down Britain in the Eastern Front, he became again the head role of the German Nuclear Program, whom, he used several liberated Jewish scientists in the Research, that became the Reich's main priority, and in return, Gottler gave the Jews as a reparation of war damage land in Belgium, whom occupied Belgium became the new Jewish state in Europe, renamed to ""New Jerusalem"" (not that Gottler ""loved"" the Jews, it's sort of like a ""Here's the land you wanted, now make me science!"").  To hide the errors of the Holocaust, Gottler blamed the Holocaust on Hitler's Generals and the Communists, who had secretly forced Jews to be hated as a distraction to the Aryan race's true enemies: the Communists, Gottler sentenced to death all of Hitler's generals for ""Treason against The Germanic Race"", and cooperating with the Communists, he also disbanded the NDSAP and founded the True Aryan Party (TAP), in order to fit in Gottler's ideologies, and Judaism with National Socialism (???).  With the war ongoing with Britain by 1942, Gottler chose to not attempt to invade Britain, as it could damage Germany's resources in its nuclear program, also in 1942, where the Pearl Harbor Attack was seemingly going to happen later, Gottler told Japan to not attack the United States, and to stop attacking China, but instead, join its forces with Germany to attack the USSR in the future (Germany was developing a nuclear bomb much faster under Gottler's command, as he was a former skilled Uranprojekt member).  In December 22, 1944, after conquering Rome and fully annexing Italy, Germany dropped the world's first atomic bomb in London, resulting in the UK's surrender, as well as the other nations involved, leaving Germany victorious in this alternative ""World"" War II, named the ""German-British War"" due to its short length and lack of too much parties involved.  Against the Commies: With the war successful, Germany and Japan were ready to attack the USSR, without the USSR even noticing, Germany launched an atomic bomb in Moscow in December 28, 1944, killing Stalin and his Politburo, with the USSR in confusion, Japan and Germany launched a double attack on the Soviet Union, causing the USSR's government to flee to the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, and Germany and Japan running to occupy Asia in an alternative version of the ""Run for Berlin"" between the Allies and the USSR, whom, Northern Asia was divided by Germany and Japan by the Lake Baikal, the United States completely erased all of their chances to join the War afraid of it being the next target, but for some reason, Gottler did not attacked America, with this, Germany and Japan became the world's dominating powers.   Aftermath of the war: Gottler stayed that he would avenge Hitler's death and build his Aryan dream in the world, blaming the Communists as the true evil of the world, not Jews, Gottler was later proclaimed ""Geistfürher"" of the Reich or ""Ghost Fürher"", as a tribute to Hitler, staying that his leadership would prevail under Gottler's rule, Gottler also said that Hitler was Jewish in his propaganda stunts.  Meanwhile, Hirohito, goes absolutely apeshit, with nothing to stop Japan, they are able to honor the Tanaka Memorial and start a worldwide Nipponization, they nvade India, and plan to conquer Oceania, Germany creates the Sino-Mongol Federation (SMF) to avoid Japanese ambitions in the nation, after Germany refuses Japan's request to annex China, Japan starts provoking Germany after they announce that they will start their own Nuclear Program in 1947, starting a Cold War against Japan and Germany (although with Japan's outdated technology, it takes way longer for them to build their weapons).  Japan occupies the Maldives and Ceylon, a Japanese invasion of Australia occurs in 1948 but fails, Australia then becomes quickly allied with Germany, to avoid Japanese's Sphere taking over, for some reason, the US's neutrality in this Cold War is deeply respected by Germany (who think that it is useless to waste resources in another war), but not by Japan, who keep invading Alaska over the years, this causes the US to become a little allied with Germany against Japan, whom a WWIII between Japan, the US, India, and Germany is imminent.  By the 50's and 70's, Germany and Japan start to modernize themselves, while Japan is mainly focused on their Military, the infamous Atlantropa Ultra-engineering plan to dam the Atlantic Ocean occurs, and with Atlaßchneider projet, Crimea is sewn off Ukraine, in order for it to become a Nuclear Testing industrial place, as well as trying to unite Madagascar to mainland Africa via a gigantic artifical land bridge with the Eurafrika created, Gottler seeks Lebensraum in Africa, and annexes almost all of Europe's former colonies to the Reich, creating the largest nation on Earth, while the last neutral colonial powers Spain and Portugal unite to form Iberia, although of these merits, the space race never happened, due to this, Human technology and culture is much more outdated than in our timeline.  TL;DR Germany becomes a modernized USSR/USA-like world superpower in civil war while Japan becomes a massive genocidal 1984-like totalitarian thought-crime state.  In July 15th, 1983, with the world in the edge of nuclear war, the story begins, and ends here because I don't remember the rest of the story (I only remember the stuff I spent hours writing, and that did not included snuggles, cheek-kisses, and Gottler being an obnoxious perverted Otaku neckbeard).  After the beginning scene of the girl arriving in the German military college, basically, the US, India, and Germany sign an Allied alliance against Japan after the Japanese invasion of Alaska, whom Geistfüher Gottler is working with President Robert F. Kennedy and India's resistance leader Kunhiraman Candeth attempting to find a plan to stop Japan's advance in Asia and America in a non-nuclear way, meanwhile, Germany is facing several terrorist threats from Neo Nazis (wait, what?) from the Reformed National Socialist Worker's Party, a insurgent group probably made by Hitler's many Generals who survived Gottler's purge, and are attempting to put in Germany the ""true"" National Socialism (i.e. re-implement Antisemitism and Racial superiority), it is later revealed that these Neo-Nazis are funded by Japan, increasing tensions even more between the two countries.

imaginarymaps,2s31hk,TheoHooke,2,Mon Jan 12 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"And, what's interesting here is that the relative insignificance of France apparently has led to an independent Normandy.  Without the Normans being in fief to the French crown, do they adopt Christianity, feudalism, and the French language at all?  If not, when William of Normandy attempts to assert his claim to the crown of England in 1066, what's he bringing with him to England -- French-style feudalism, or just more Viking settlers?  Maybe these Normans just assimilate into the existing and much more decentralized culture and institutions of Anglo-Saxon England, and end up having a completely different relationship to Ireland than OTL's Normans did.  I don't see why Scotland controls the northern half of Ireland, though.  IIRC, OTL Bruce's invasion in the 14th century was to challenge Norman power, and he never annexed territory in Ireland."

imaginarymaps,2s31hk,Screaming_Eagle,-1,Mon Jan 12 07:30:34 2015 UTC,"The reason the HRE doesn't even exist in this time period was because France lost the Battle of Tours. Charlemagne's grandfather was king at this time, and with his dynasty losing so much land to the Umayyads, the Franks were not able to have enough power to go about forming the Holy Roman Empire. With the HRE not existing, the former Duchy of Austria went out of it's way to go about Christianizing much of eastern and southeastern Europe through decades of Holy Wars."
imaginarymaps,2s31hk,Screaming_Eagle,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"the Franks were not able to have enough power to go about forming the Holy Roman Empire.    It would seem to me that the Franks losing most of Aquitania to the Moors would have caused a somewhat larger German-centered HRE -- even if it didn't go by that name -- as the territories of East Francia would be too weak to break away from it.  It's France that shouldn't exist here, not the HRE, and yet we see a 'Grand Duchy of Paris' controlling territory that in OTL belonged to vassal duchies and not the crown of France itself all the way up to the French Revolution.  ""Austria-Hungary"" doesn't make much sense here -- where does Austria come from if there's no HRE to establish a march on its eastern frontier?  And why would such an Austria be in a union with Hungary in 1401, when the Habsburgs weren't even involved in Hungarian politics until the 1520s, OTL, and the dual monarchy wasn't established until the 19th century?"
imaginarymaps,2s31hk,Wereflea,0,Mon Jan 12 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"They aren't in a union in this timeline, they simply have taken over the Hungarians via holy wars. The reason it is called the Austro-Hungarian Empire isn't due to a union, rather the reason is that those are the two largest ethnic groups residing within the empire.    It would seem to me that the Franks losing most of Aquitania to the Moors would have caused a somewhat more centralized German-centered HRE -- even if it didn't go by that name -- as the territories of East Francia would be too weak to break away from it.   Again, none of the Frankish Kingdoms ever united under one leader in the first place, due to the fact that the Franks were never able to unite the Germanic peoples residing to the east of them."

imaginarymaps,2rur31,octobert,3,Sat Jan 10 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"Beginning of the Age of Aquarius (PBTMO)   It's hard to believe in an era when the ocean didn't consist of a vast expanse of unbroken water, but that is the world we live in. Once known as ""Earth"" even though just barely a quarter of its surface was covered with dry land, our planet Aquarius (Praise Be to Mother Ocean) once consisted of a series of landed nation-states, similar to the technical bases that on the ocean floor: static, unmoving, and ever changing. Much of the water on our former planet was locked up in two huge ends called ""Ice Caps."" One floating above the north pole, the other sitting on top of the southernmost landmass.   In the event that those ice caps melted, it was common knowledge that the oceans would rise and many disasters would result, but the scientists and cartographers who drew the new coastlines on their maps dramatically underestimated how much ice was there. New methods for measuring ice, including improper mapping of the Pre-Melt Poles, the mistakes made looking at the southern landmass' geography, and how to properly measure ice floating in the ocean all have their own articles and resources that are a little beyond my skill set.   The 21st Century was a time of war. The large powers of the world (principal among them being Europe, America, Brazil, China, Russia and India) fought each other through proxy and reality over precious living spaces as the lowlands filled up quickly. By 2100, less than 10% of land was left on the new planet we called Aquarius (PBTMO). By 2200, none of it was left and most people lived in collected raft communities.   These communities were the most dramatic shift in the structure of human society since the beginnings of civilization. In the mid-21st Century, when the last of the Hollander dikes broke open, it was increasingly apparent that this method of climate change resistance was futile. It began with ships beginning to experience longer periods at sea, and congregating with other ships. In an endless ocean, the fisherman is king. The ocean of the 21st Century were overfished to an alarming degree, but the rapidly evolving eco-system, and the rock-dropping nature of the planet's human population compensated. By 2300, the ocean's ecosystem had recovered - there was ample room to expand the dying coral reefs. Not to mention the sudden lack of industry and engineering that was lying on the new beds of ocean.   New cultural systems developed on the raft villages. In a world of almost seamless oceanic landscape (remember, the ocean floor is an intricate Arabesque labyrinth of terrain) we live by boat, and rain, and sun. We follow the pods of whale and school of fish. It's incredibly hard to imagine when the world wasn't your neighbor, is it? When the separation of the village and the beginning of the next migration season will consist of concurrent circumnavigations. No, back before the Age of Aquarius, (PBTMO) people lived in static structures on the land called houses or buildings. I've included some pictures below for reference."

imaginarymaps,2rv6gv,jPaolo,2,Fri Jan 9 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"I like the map quite a bit. Some observations:   Presumably, after the US lost the Confederate states it expanded north, perhaps in revenge for British support for the Confederacy. Splitting off empty northern Ontario is also right; no reason to make Ontario larger than other midwestern states. Perhaps Quebecois assisted the Americans and received their own nation as a reward. Having British Canada retain Newfoundland also makes sense. What's with the territory north of the US? If Russia didn't sell Alaska to the US, what happened to it? If it became an independent nation under White Russian refugees after 1917, why did it get the territory to its east? Speaking of that territory, how did the US get southern Rupert's Land but not the rest? Australia is British but New Zealand is really British. New Zealand did not ratify the Statute of Westminster until 1947. Republicanism there has never had significant support, unlike its Australian counterpart. It's possible, even likely, that if Ned Kelly's Australia revolted in the 19th century Britain could have retained New Zealand, à la the US and Canada. Having Communist China conquer Japan seems very unlikely; if anything I'd expect the Japanese Empire to hold Korea, Taiwan, and chunks of mainland China."

Thank you for helping me identify my error.  The Australians presumably view the Japanese as their top threat. They must be allied with a larger power for defense, but who? They might have to swallow their pride and seek help from their former colonial masters. (It's possible that the Anglo-Japanese Alliance still exists, of course, but I don't know how compatible it would be with an actively expansionist Japanese Empire.)"
imaginarymaps,2rv6gv,BlueHighwindz,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"So, to answer your questions:   Pretty much correct on those bits. And yeah, Les Québécois aided the Americans, because fuck them Brits :P That territory north of the US is none other than the Republic of Alaska, formed from a combination of the defeated Whites and already-present Canadians and natives. The reason it controls so much is because the former Tsar saw a chance to increase his reputation by conquering a portion of Canada. Also, there was a minor war between the USA and the Alaskans during the 1920's. The reasoning is a combination of 1. it was too damn cold for the Americans, and 2. it really wasn't considered that important. Good point. I'm not really that knowledgeable in Kiwi politics or history. So I'll write that one off as Australia simply occupying NZ.  Like /u/zhemao said, Japan is still large and in charge along the coastal areas of China, Korea, and Manchuria. Long live the Daitōakyōeiken! :P"

While they are generally informative, I thought it would be nice to have more of a smooth animation. After watching this amazing animation, I was even more inspired to create a smooth year-to-year animation.    So I took the Ottoman Empire, and made an alternate growth of it. This animation starts in 1299, the historical beginning of the Ottomans, and goes 455 frames to 1754, with each frame being a year. Playing at a rate of 12fps, it lasts roughly 38 seconds. I really wanted to go all the way to present day, but after 455 frames, GIMP, which I was using to create this animation, really started lagging hard.    The point that most people ask about is when suddenly a bunch of territory worldwide is added to the empire. If you had been watching Europe prior to that, they are engaged in a war against the Iberian Union, and after winning the ""Siege of Madrid"" they gain all of their territories.

Some nobles and governors began to act as independent monarchs, while the autonomy of some cities grew until they almost became sovereign republics. Then, a series of wars between all those factions, while the King attemped to keep the order, led to the collapse of the kingdom.   The Kingdom of West Gondor is the only land controlled by the former King of the Reunited Kingdom (R.K.), Elros III. After the Legions were decimated during the wars, he fled to the Lefnui valley, the only feud that remained loyal to him. The hobbits are dispersed through the former Reunited Kingdom, living in very poor conditions. They were banished from the Shire when the R.K. businessmen took control of the pipe weed production and destroyed the hobbit-holes for building holiday cottages. The Greater Shire is a Men's territory, currently confederated with the Duchy of Harlindon. The Kingdom of Annúminas claims to be the true Kingdom of Arnor. It is ruled by Aranarth II, cousin of Elros III. He is officially a viceroy under his cousin, but has adopted the title of King and acts as an independent monarch. The State of Arnor was formed when the Parliament of Fornost forced Aranarth II to adopt a Constitution. The King of Annúminas declined and a war between the Parliament and the Royalists occurred. A front line was formed, but it has remained static for two decades because each antagonist had to deal with threats from other territories. Meanwhile, the Parliament has chosen Argonui III, illegitimate son of Aranarth's uncle, as their king. The pirate clans of Umbar raided the coast of the R.K. during the wars. Some of them settled in Anfalas, which had been abandoned by the Legions, and founded the Pirate Republic of Anfalas. The Republic of Gondor was formed when the republics of Minas Anor, Pelargir and West Osgiliath merged and conquered the County of Lossarnach. The short-lived Republic of East Osgiliath was retaken by the Principality of Ithilien. The Kingdom of Rohan suffered a civil war when Théodred II died without heir. Two far relatives claimed the throne, but could not bring down each other. One of them, Felgen III, set his throne in Hornburg and was proclaimed King of West Rohan, but he was commonly adressed as King of the Isen. Paradoxically, he lost almost all his dominions in the valley of the Isen after a brief war against the Republic of Isengard. The settlements of the Anduin valley were once allied to the R.K. Some decades before the wars most of the settlements had become rich cities and the population was constantly increasing. Rhosgobel imposed its domination on the region and proclaimed the First Empire of the Anduin Valley. The Empire was involved in the civil war in Rohan: they initally supported the king in Edoras, but ended seizing the East Emnet, which they gave to another pretender that was under their control. Elves: Only a few populations remain in Middle Earth. All their kingdoms have been abandoned. Some wood elves live in small settlements in the Greenwood. The former Grey Haven elves have been pushed northwards. Dwarves: Only a few hundreds are alive."

imaginarymaps,2rmypt,oftenlygetscatraped,3,Thu Jan 8 12:41:58 2015 UTC,"Summary of the Fifth Age Trilogy.  In 1991, the world was markedly different form the world of 1937 and the early '50s, so it's not a massive surprise that Tolkien's second Middle Earth Trilogy was different from his first. It has been claimed that the Lord of the Rings was an allegory for World War II or the Cold War, with the good and noble forces of the West fighting over the overwhelming darkness of the evil East.  When he was interviewed in 1973, Tolkien vehemently attacked this interpretation saying, ""If I wanted to write about Stalin or Hitler, I would have."" The interview, which drew the attention of many, contributed to the popularity of the Middle Earth mythos. First George Lucas and then Stanley Kubrick approached Tolkien seeking to turn the film into a movie series. Kubrick - who once considered the film too massive to film approached the epic with fresh eyes and a new vision that Tolkien liked. Tolkien resists the notion that Kubrick's psychadelic and morally ambiguous version of Middle Earth had an effect on his later trilogy, but these allegations are tempting to consider.   In The Wandering Lost (1991) Tolkien follows Drogo and Gaffer, two half-Hobbits who witness the collapse of the Reunited Kingdom. Drogo and Gaffer are morally ambiguous as are the majority of characters around them. Drogo is the antithesis of Catholic virtue: he is lecherous, a drunk, and while he believes in the gods, considers them absent from the world, ""Gone to Valinor with the Elves."" Gaffer is an atheist who chooses to try and rescue his lover in Bree rather than his wife and child in Minas Tirith. Together they avoid a fad of young men without moral boundaries dressing up as orcs to kill and make mischief for pleasure. Supposedly, the collapse of the Telcontar Reunited Kingdom was supposed to resemble the fall of the Soviet Union. Tolkien said he already had this idea in mind and likened Middle Earth's Third Age to the Hellenic Golden Age, and the Fifth Age as a slide into the Silver Age.   The second book A Light from the Shadows (1992) considers the brief possibility of a Telcontar Restoration as Drogo and Gaffer continue on their journey. King Elros III makes a deal with King Under the Mountain Thorin III to divide Middle Earth in half in exchange for a permanent alliance of men and dwarves. The war is doomed from the start, with the League of Eriador forming to destroy the alliance. As the Gondorian-Ereborian forces march west, they meet the League army in Fangorn where a Stalingrad-esque encounter takes place with Gaffer and Drogo barely surviving. The League army succeeds and marches east to put Minas Tirith to siege.   The final book was published a year after Tolkien's death in 1993. In The Crownless King, Drogo makes it to Minas Tirith to find a society vastly different from the one remembered in Return of the King. The white city is a hellish industrial landscape that is intended to remind the reader of Isengard's Uruk Hai construction. Elements of Tolkien's native South African apartheid are worked in, as Hobbits - refugees of their native Shire - live as second-class citizens in what is left of Gondor. Drogo and Gaffer end up breaking off their friendship which proves beneficial to Drogo: he helps Gaffer's wife escape the siege and together they move to the Anduin. Drogo becomes a teetotaler and raises his adopted son in peace and religion. The House of Telcontar is extinguished, and the line of Durin dies with Thorin III. The League forces Gondor into a republican government which is overrun by oligarchic interests.   The Fifth Age is something of a mystery to Tolkienologists to this day. It is believed that Lord of the Rings is his British Mythology, while The Fifth Age is his British Reality. Directors are still fighting over the rights for the film ever since Kubrick's death in '99. The most recent rumors have David Benioff and D.B. Weiss as the most likely candidates, with Vince Gillighan expressing interest in screen writing."
imaginarymaps,2rplh5,Swiggityswagity,3,Thu Jan 8 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the first thing you need to do is scan it into your computer as a jpeg file..  Once it's in there, you can then work on it with various graphics programs.  Photoshop, if money's not an object.  Otherwise, a decent, cheap general purpose graphics program is Paint Shop Pro.  A great freeware graphics program is the GIMP.  If you don't have much familiarity with graphics programs, plan on spending a little time getting used to them.  You can find various tutorials on fantasy mapmaking on Youtube.  One program that is very helpful is Campaign Cartographer.  This program is designed for making fantasy maps, and you can use your own outline map as the base.  Here are some of the types of output you can achieve.  I'm pretty sure stormelemental13's map was made using this program.  And there are tutorials.  But even if you get Campaign Cartographer, I'd strongly suggest getting a general graphics program also, or at least putting the GIMP on your computer.  You can use the graphics program for post-processing and final touch ups."
imaginarymaps,2rplh5,Cdresden,3,Thu Jan 8 09:34:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! The only problem is that it's on a large sheet of paper, so could I scan it twice?"
imaginarymaps,2rplh5,Cdresden,2,Thu Jan 8 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"If it's larger than the scanning surface, you can scan in 4 sections and then stitch those back together into one picture in your computer.  However, if you have no graphics experience, lining up the pieces using a mouse is not a great first exercise.  If you have a Kinko's or other copy center near you, they have larger scanners and can put it on a thumb drive for you."

imaginarymaps,2rigy4,ZombineTM,22,Tue Jan 6 13:42:31 2015 UTC,"Making History is a time-travel Axis Victory story, but a very different one, in this Axis Victory, Hitler was never born!  The protagonist is Michael Young, a student at Cambridge with a huge fascination for Hitler, WWII, and the holocaust, he meets Professor Leo Zuckerman, a physicist who is also very interested on the subjects.  Michael assumes this is due to his Jewish heritage. However, it is later revealed that Leo was born Axel Bauer, the son of Dietrich Bauer, a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz. Leo has developed a machine that enables the past to be viewed—but it is of no practical use as the image is not resolvable into details. Together, they hatch a plan to modify the machine such that it can be used to send something back into time. They decide to use a permanent male contraceptive pill, stolen from Michael's girlfriend (a biochemistry researcher), who, due to his continual distraction, has left him to take a position at Princeton University. They decide to send this pill back in time to the well in Braunau am Inn so that Hitler's father will drink from it, become infertile, and Hitler will never be born.  When Michael awakens he is completely disoriented. He soon discovers that he is in the United States, at Princeton University. Everyone he encounters is surprised that he is speaking with an English accent. It takes some time for Michael's memory to return. He realises that his plan was successful, history has changed, and for some reason his parents must have moved to America. Initially he is elated and tells his new friend Steve how happy he is because Steve has never heard of Hitler, Braunau am Inn, or the Nazi party. Steve corrects Michael and reveals that he is well aware of the Nazi party.  Michael begins to discover the history of this new world. It turns out that without Hitler, a new leader emerged, Rudolf Gloder, who was equally sadistic and ruthless as Hitler. In fact, Michael and Zuckerman have replaced Hitler with a Nazi leader who was even more charismatic, patient, and effective, and as committed to the Final Solution as Hitler had been.  Here it begins the alt history: The Nazis won a mandate in the Reichstag in 1932 and built up an electronics industry of their own. Unlike Hitler, Gloder proceeded with stealth, ensuring peaceful unification with Austria in 1937 due to his Charisma and Leadership. More alarmingly, Gloder's Nazis also had a head start on the research and development of nuclear weapons, which led to the destruction of Moscow and Leningrad, eliminating Joseph Stalin and his Politburo by 1938. The Greater German Reich annexes Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Turkey, and invades the remnants of the former Soviet Union. In 1939, France, Britain, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations capitulate, although Britain rebels in 1941, leading to the execution of several dissidents, among them the Duke of York (the historical King George VI). Jews are exiled to a ""Jewish Free State"" within the former Yugoslavia, where most of this world's Holocaust occurs. The United States develops nuclear weapons in 1941, leading to a Cold War between Nazi Germany, its satellites, and the United States. The latter has never gone to war against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, and it is left unsaid whether Japan has its own nuclear weapons as well.  Due to these changes, the Nazis are now the dominant power in the world. The plan for genocide of the Jewish race came to fruition, although this is only implied, never explicitly stated. (Every time Michael attempts to ask someone what happened to Europe's Jews, he receives no answer.)   The United States is engaged in a fierce struggle short of combat against the Nazis, supporting former Soviet guerrillas fighting in Siberia. As a result, this United States has become far more socially conservative. Because there was no sixties upsurge of social liberalism and decriminalization of homosexuality in (Nazi-occupied) Western Europe in this world, the latter is still a felony.  It was very hard to make this map since they barely tell how much the world is on the book, but I like the concept that shows that Hitler was not a effective leader, like Napoleon said: ""When your enemy is doing something wrong, do not interrupt him""."

But the time machine that caused Hitler to never be born in the novel was very interesting, it was a device used to hear people talking in the past, Michael told Leo to attempt to modify it in order for them to send something to the past to change history, they sent a male contraceptive pill that fell in Branau's water well, causing all villagers (including Alois Hitler) to become infertile, resulting in Hitler never being born.

imaginarymaps,2rghw3,mbingcrosby,13,Tue Jan 6 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"Hey so KY here. I guess the main thing I would like to see is geographic variation. Make sure the mountains stay in east KY. I've actually seen maps that think the Appalachians take most of our state. And ours are not so much pure mountains and a plateau of hills.   The Bluegrass is much more populated and has all the wealth and horse farms. I would liken it to Rohan.   And the west is mainly flat with rolling hills and full of farms. But one thing that would be unique is if Land Between the Lakes was called it's original cultural name Between the Rivers. And everything west of there to the Mississippi is very flat and delta like and bottomlands.  Some other ideas that are just ideas that do not have to happen:  •Louisville is very independent of the rest of the state, and considers itself a national city. So maybe making it an independent city-state. ALso the original motto of the city was Perseverando.  •The Abbey of Gethsemanie is a little known Trappist monestary that would totally fit into the fantasy map. So is the Versailles Castle and Eddyville Prison (also known as the Castle on the Cumberland)  •The Barrens which are in and around Barren County are their own interesting geographic feature which are always left in the shadow of Mammoth Cave, which should be called the cave of wonders without a doubt.   •Kentucky is a land of rivers. The Ohio, Big Sandy, Cumberland, Kentucky, Licking, Green and Tennessee should all be featured.   •The Daniel Boone is not as expansive as it looks on most maps, most of that is land proposed to be bought. If anything just call it the great barrier forest and make sure to highlight the gorge in the north tip.  •Where Cumberland Falls is it is famous for it's Moon Bow, and the name Cumberland is kind of offensive to some Kentuckian's for historical reasons. So maybe look up another name for that and the river.  •Cities of note: Louisville, Lexington, Covington, Ashland, Paducah, Bowling Green, Owensboro. Those are not in any order. Just cities spread apart far enough to potentially make labeling easier.  •Black and Pine Mtns. Are the two highest mountain. But much of the region of southeast KY has been devastated by strip mining and pollution. I would in all honesty not hesitate to call them wastelands, or mountain wastes. It's very sad but true in some aspects. (There is even the city called Hazard you could play up on.  •Most Bourbon comes from an area following the Bourbon Trail From Louisville to Bardstown to Lexington.   •Don't forget the knobs.  •The area between Elizabethtown and Paducah is called the Pennyrile. But the area specifically around Princeton to Hopkinsville then elkton and Murray is called the Black Patch from the dark fired tobacco farmed there.  •Ancient Mounds in Wickliffe.   •Frankfort is not actually a big capitol. It was chosen to compromise Lex. and Louis. So maybe not even putting it in.   •On Pine Mtn. in Letcher County there is a really cool place called Wiley's Last Resort. Just thought that would look cool.   • Here is a list of city nicknames to help you be creative for a more fantasy setting.  •As far as neighbors go, Kentuckian's get along well most with Tennesseans and West Virginians. We don't think much about Virginia and Missouri, as the borders are so small and far away. Indiana is seen as boring and just as if not more backward. Illinois is not thought about much. But FYI that southern part of Illinois between Carbondale and KY is called Little Egypt. Not many people know that. And then there is Ohio. The general feeling is pretty negative, most people will call them slang Buckeyes in a negative way. There is quite a lot of bad blood there. Especially anyone north of Cinci.   I know this is a ton and certainly would not expect to see it all or even half on the map. I just hope this gives you a good start and some leads to make an awesome map. We Kentuckians love our state and I think this is an awesome idea you have going. Let me know if you have any questions or follow ups."

I was thinking again and thought I would add a few more things just because why not.  •KY was originally going to be called Transylvania based on the land purchase from the Cherokee, which is Latin for through the woods.   •Livingston County is the largest inland island in the lower 48. It also has a neat little harbor town called Grand Rivers. It's like an Atlantic Seaboard town but on the canal that connects the two rivers.   •Cave-in-Rock is a place right across the Ohio in Illinois famous for it's River Pirates during westward expansion.   •The Wilderness Road was the original route in the state and the great Buffalo Trace begins near Louisville, near the Salt Licks. Buffalo used to be in the region by the millions, and so were mammoths in their time.   •Berea is the Gateway to the Mountains.  And that is about it. Thanks again."

Change the Purchase to Riverlands, it's also known as Great Rivers/Four Rivers region irl.  Just north of Western Black Mines make a small name like the Barrens called Burgooland. Look up Borgoo, you'll understand.  Would it be possible to take out state lines and just leave natural boundaries? Just letting the other Kingdom names stand alone. But keep the shading.

imaginarymaps,2rghw3,Clovis69,4,Tue Jan 6 09:52:26 2015 UTC,"WA here. There should be some difference visible between the Eastern part and Western part of the state.  The west is lush and mountainous and the east is drier with rolling brown hills and farms.  Over by Walla Walla, Pullman and Lewiston are the Palouse Fields.  These are beatiful rolling hills of wheat for as far as the eye can see and were formed during the Missoula Floods, a long time ago.  The area between north Seattle and Everett is known as a convergence zone.  While Washington gets a bad reputation for a lot of rain (when it actually has 300 days of sunshine a year) this place deserves that rep.  It can be sunny across the entire state and this area will at the very least still be overcast.  The area south and east of the Columbia River on the eastern part of the state, but north of the Snake River is known as the Columbia River Plateau.    Although the Hoover Dam gets all the attention, the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington is the largest in the United States.  Don't forget to include the Cascade mountains, the San Juan Islands, the Olympic Mountains, Lake Chelan and the Columbia River.  I'll edit if I think of anything else."

imaginarymaps,2rghw3,Fangorn_Stark,1 point,Tue Jan 6 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Western Washingtonians have this saying that if you can see Mt. Rainier, ""the mountain is out"". We also use the word ""drizzle"" more than any other state (because it doesn't usually rain here, it drizzles), and we also forecast ""sun breaks"". It is generally gray from the end of October until the middle or end of June (leading to lots of vitamin A deficiencies). The Yakima Valley produces a lot of wine and fruit because the soil composition (leftover from the Missoula floods, as mentioned above) combined with the rain shadow from the Cascades provides an ideal climate for fruit growing. In fact, they don't even have to graft their grape vines. Yakima claims to be ""the Palm Springs of the Northwest"" which we all know is a lie. In the southeastern part of the state, you have the Tri-Cities (Pasco, Kennewick, and Richland). If you were to take a drive from Seattle to Spokane, it would start out very green (and probably drizzly), you would head through some pretty beautiful mountain scenery, pass Lake Easton and Snoqualmie Pass Ski Area, and emerge into Cle Elum (Clee-ell-um) and some crazy boring flat, dry, practically desert-y kind of landscape. Then you'll drive for several more hours through the same stuff (brush, so scrubby, and we even have tumbleweed!) until you reach Spokane, which is mostly north of all those cool rolling hills. The Microsoft background with the green fields? Eastern Washington (Thanks Bill Gates!). The Palouse is that region, and is home to Washington State University (Pullman, WA). Grand Coulee is also pretty neat, and has a laser light show most nights in the summer. It resides in Electric City and dams up Banks Lake, home to Steamboat Rock (such clever naming). Speaking of naming, if you live on the east side of the state, you call your side of the Cascades the East Side, and the other one the West Side, but if you live in Western Washington, you call the east side of the lakes the East Side (which is where all the Microsoft families live) and the Seattle area is the West Side. Also, there are tons of crazy names, like Puyallup (pronounced pew-al-up, where Al is pronounced like the name), Steilacoom (stilla-cum), Spokane (spoh-can), and everything is named after something Native American. Seattle was a NA chief (but his name was actually Sealth...I don't know how to pronounce that), and my hometown (Enumclaw) means ""valley of the evil winds"". Starbucks started in Seattle, but since everyone here is hipster, it's not cool to go to a Starbucks (despite having one on every corner...like ABC stores in Hawaii). Seattle is a bustling place with bad traffic and bad drivers who don't know how to drive in any weather that isn't gray. There is a lot of diversity here, and lots of interesting history that won't help with maps, but it's a really cool place to visit. Politically, Western WA is liberal (it has more people, so it makes the state liberal) and Eastern WA is conservative. We also have Mt. Saint Helens, and several other mtns on the ring of fire.   That's about all I can think of for now."

Typically the state is divided into 3 areas:  The Mountains (to the west), the Piedmont (in the middle, more or less) and the Coastal Plains (East).  The Mountains   Composed of 4 different ranges; Appalachian, Brushies, Blue Ridge, and Uwharrie.   High peaks that get very cold winter and fairly hot in the summer.   A lot of people in this area are descended from Scottish/Irish immigrants.  So much so that there are annual Highland Games in several areas.  A region of Highlanders, vast forests and rough terrain.      The Piedmont   Highest population density and the largest cities are in the middle section. Foothills and valleys with a lot of open farms in between cities.  The larger cities in the Piedmont are diverse economic areas. Charlotte is the 2nd largest financial center in the US.   Winston-Salem/Greensboro are homes to Manufacturing, Transportation, Textiles, Tobacco and (recently) nanotechnology.  Area is known as ""The Triad"" Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill make up Research Triangle Park, AKA the Triangle; home of advanced scientific research and development.     Coastal Plains   largest section of the state, 45% of overall area. larger area = a lot of universities and college spreadout Outer Banks, on the ocean.  Locations of Lighthouse, beaches, Sounds and The Graveyard of the Atlantic. major seaport Lots of farmland and deciduous forests.  Riverlands and marshes too.  A favorite of mine is the Tar River (lived near it once).  Named because it is dark colored and slow moving.

The Jersey shore, despite the show, really is a lovely place that all New Jerseyians love to visit and live at. It is more densely populated at first but as you progress southward it because less so. Also in the central/ south shore there are barrier islands which make up the shore and give us the beaches. -Starting in the center and sprawling out southward is The Pine Barrens, land of the Pineys (its residents). The pine barrens is a strange and wonderful place. The people are weird, but good. It has history of being a criminal hideout since the start of the country, but not so much anymore. Now its just hicks (yes we have them to those who do not know). -To the west of the Pine barrens is the Delaware River Valley, it is not so much of a valley but more like a ton of farms of suburbs with pockets of woods and loads of streams leading to larger streams eventually to the Delaware River.  Moving on to Deep South Jersey, everything south of the pine barrens as far as I know is marshes, woods and farms.  Hope this helps"

Though maybe a tribal political map might be interesting or at least a fun overlay over the style you used for wisconsin.   Mass has 3 major regions This map is pretty helpful. Western Mass is labeled 1, Central Mass is labeled 2, Eastern mass is technically 3&4 though the cape and the islands can be thought of their own thing. Eastern Mass save for the cape and islands is wall to wall cities and suburbs, very densely populated. Most of this is sea level with some hills that begin the ascent into central mass. Central Mass is more conservative ethnically a bit more french and english and more likely redneck-y or hickish. Lots of atvs and going hunting and really being into having a muscle car. Physically its all very hillish and has most of the higher elevation points of the state and also gets more snow than eastern mass because of it. The area where Central and Eastern Mass meet in the center to south center are also very portuguese but now more brazilian too. Western Mass is it's own thing. They are the only parts of the state that aren't in anyway part of the Greater Boston/Eastern Mass Culture. The Berkshire mountains are at the back chunk of the west where the straight line border with NY. Think of them as a part of a country that borders another big personality country, like france or spain along the pyrennees. western Mass has a section that is all colleges and is very liberal/ hippy dippy but it also is pockmarked with shitty crime ridden (for MA) cities, one of which is literally called pittsfield. Cities: Massachusetts has a weird thing where Boston and Cambridge are quite safe and affluent cities--but about every other city in Massachusetts is shitty and rough.  South of Boston near Providence and a little above there is a triangle of cities Brockton, fall River and New Bedford. All of them suck. These and a fe wof the north of Boston cities are the original Rust Belt. During the early industrial revolution these were booming mill towns. But then the Midwest happened and they all floundered. New Bedford and Fall River are super Portuguese. While Brockton is a smorgasbord of Minorities (Latinos, Black maericans, Immigrants from Cape Verde and Haiti, South east Asians) North of Boston are another triangle of shitty cities: Lynn, Lowell and Lawrence. Same deal as the south only Lowell and Lynn have the 2nd and 3rd largest Cambodian populations. Lynn is also very latin. Lawrence is super latin mostly DR and PR. worcester is in Central MA, is the second largest city and is a shithole. Springfield is in western MA is the third largest city, very Latin but the other half is garbage white people. A few years back it was the worst small city in the country. Home of the Basketball Hall of Fame and the sports birthplace. The Quabbin reservoir is along the Central/Western Ma border and is where all the water for the eastern and central parts of the state come from. It is huge and actually a bunch of towns were evacuated and then flooded to make it. I don't know if you want to do a sunken city thing.  The Cape and Islands have super wealthy Vacationers (Nantucket is more ealthy than Martha's vineyard which also has a large Native american Population) But the people who live there year round (esp. The Cape and Martha's Vineyard) are super weird. I don't know what you can do with that but it's a thing."

Some other things to include:  Stull in Northeast Kansas has a cemetery that is rumored to contain a gateway to Hell (Clinton Lake is a little bit southeast of it, and would be a nice addition to the map)  In Pottawatomie, Kansas in 1856, abolitionist John Brown and his men killed a number of pro-slavery settlers with broadswords, so there's another thing you could add. You could use this famous painting.  Also in 1856, Lawrence, Kansas (my hometown!) was burned down by pro-slavery activists. The town's motto today is ""from ashes to immortality"", and it's the site of the University of Kansas. You could use something relating to the sack and something related to the university - here's one of the more famous and picturesque buildings. KU is also very very well known for our college basketball tradition, so that might be something to work in.  Wichita is the biggest city, but there isn't really that much to it. It's just big and there's lots of aircraft industry stuff there.  Since I included my alma mater, I should probably include the town with our rival, Manhattan.

The fission weapons - weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs. These would be your Hiroshima bomb. They can go up to 500 Kt in yield.  The thermonuclear weapons - those which produces a large proportion of its energy in nuclear fusion reactions. Those are commonly referred to as hydrogen bombs. They have multiple stages (fission-fusion, fission-fusion-fusion) and can scale up to 50+ Mt in yield. They are generally lighter and smaller than fission weapons, but vastly more complicated to design and build than a classic atomic bomb.

Examples of this can be found in the Belgon river/forest and in the Senijur marshes.

Even if Russia stayed in as long as it did, Italy failing to join the Allies would mean that the losses sustained would be affordable for the Habsburgs, meaning that political cohesion would be maintained. Italy joining the Central powers would be a huge boon as well, as Italy would have halted the underground liberation movements it had been encouraging at that time. This is especially true if Italy didn't join in, meaning that Serbia would have had to deal with the massive Habsburg armies, which were certainly commanded by incompetent men, but competence is only a small part of the equation if you outweigh the manpower 7-1. The Kaiser was a personal friend of Franz Josef II, and respected the Habsburg crown as well. While he hated the staff that served under him, especially in regards to Chief of Staff Conrad, he would have kept A-H intact. Even if events played out like they did, Hungary wouldn't relinquish the crown of St. Steven, nor the lands granted to it by the crowlands of Transleithania.

imaginarymaps,2rd0eh,AnAlternateHistorian,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:11:30 2015 UTC,"This map shows Germany's possible friend and foes in an event of a Second World War.  Green: Friends Red: Foes Blue: Neutral/Unknown  This situation is, IMO, worse for the Germans than WWI. The Italians and French firmly control the Med, while French and British navies could easily control the North Sea. Ukraine would quickly crumble under the weight of both Romanian and Russian armies. Poland with its plains isn't exactly defensible. Perhaps we can use the West-first strategy again?  Except France is equally strong if not stronger than its counterpart in WWI. Having lost virtually no territory apart from a few worthless colonies, combined with their ever stronger revanchism, it would be doubtful that they can be defeated quickly. While the Balkans could provide a few distractions for the Neo-Entente, German client states there would quickly collapse given the might of both Italy and Romania, by this point even ignoring the potentials of Serbia and other Entente-friendly states. The only possible fate for Germany is total defeat unless America decides to save the day.  Wilhelm II wouldn't fight a WWI for this."
imaginarymaps,2rd0eh,LeonardNemoysHead,1 point,Mon Jan 5 12:16:49 2015 UTC,Why italy would side with the allies now?
imaginarymaps,2rd0eh,Teh_Sauce_Guy,1 point,Tue Jan 6 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"According to the author,   Italy falls to extreme rightists such as the fascists even though they won the great war (much like in the real time line)   The last major threat to Italy's domination of the Balkans would be Germany and her client states. Moreover, their ideological friends, that is, the French are Germany's archenemy. Defeating Germany and thus releasing Austria would allow Italy a buffer, while securing the Balkans would mean very much to a complete Italian domination of the Med.  To me, it doesn't make much sense to side with Germany again, since their territorial goals in Western Europe are quite complete unless Fascist Italy desires the rest of Northern Africa - which is considered metropolitan France at that time, and thus, not really profitable for the Italians. Moreover, a German victory would mean the dominance of Germania in Europe; an Entente victory would not mean the same to the French, a potential foe of Italy.  Of course Italy could opt for siding with Central Powers, it is a question of Balkan dispute v. African dispute, really."

A chip off the old bloke, I thought, but then I wouldn’t have thought of doing this.

Unlike the past, where Russia would have the support of fellow monarchies, or where the communist regime ruled with an iron fist, walled off from the rest of the world's opinions, Russia can't simply crush dissent. The future is less predictable now.  edit: to clarify, I'm not thinking that it would break up any time soon, or as a result of the current crises.

Ukraine gets Crimea back.  Karelia might go independant, bits of it will want to be annexed by the far wealthier Finland but over the past century they have been thoroughly Russisized.

The party structure also wasn't as rigid as in many fascist regimes.  To be frank it was almost fascist but is best described as a fascist inspired, corporatist regime."

The French were still trying to keep Indochina in our timeline in the late 40's so it's realistic to think this would be a major source of contention in the area.  I also think Africa would be up for grabs or have formed their own regional alliances, given that while the invasion of Britain failed and the UK is apparently still free, they certainly aren't free to fly their diplomats or goods to their colonies in Africa, especially West Africa with Nazi occupied Somalia and Ethiopia.

First of all, about Hitler conquering Europe completely, he never really wanted to ""annex"" Europe or turn it into a giant Germany, he wanted all European countries to turn fascist where he would lead the ""capital"" of this fascist UN-like Union (is this true)?  The so progressive, modern, and so advanced Germannia is actually in deep fucking shit, they are next to collapsing USSR-style (?), they aren't trying to invade the US, but rather, they are trying to ease its tensions with the US and befriend it, before they destroy themselves.  My questions:  What would be rest of Yugoslavia?, since Hitler separated it into several Reichkomissariat's, would it be divided by Serbia, Montenegro, etc?, or would it be reunited after their victory?  Oh boy, the Italy problem, I attempted here a scenario where Mussolini was still kicked out in 1943, but with Nazi support he successfully implemented his Italian Social Republic and defeated the King years later, the ISR was heavily funded by Germany and even became its puppet state (?)  Would China still turn communist?  According to a very old Reddit post, an Axis Victory in WWII would be a ticket to WWIII, the nazis would face fucktons of rebels fighting within its territory, I don't know how, but they explain to me that the newly-created Greater German Reich wouldn't last for 20 years, TL;DR of this?  Apologies for any errors, post here your fixes so we can make this map like it came from an alternate dimension.  Blank version for most clarity"
imaginarymaps,2q2daz,w-alien,5,Mon Dec 22 13:01:37 2014 UTC,"Would China still turn communist?   That's really hard to say. The Chinese war with the Japanese would likely have gone on the same way, meaning the communist insurgents and the nationalist regime would still have formed an uneasy partnership to fight (rather ineffectively) against the Japanese invaders. The only reason Japan ultimately withdrew from China is because it surrendered after Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  One major instigator of the communist-nationalist civil war in post-WWII China was the end of the uneasy truce between the two sides when the Kuomintang government started purging communists and sympathizers. There's no reason to think this wouldn't happen again, but if the US was an occupying power of Japan and Korea and agreed to give Taiwan to Chinese control, it's reasonable to assume Washington would play a bigger role in internal Chinese politics and would stress national unity and stability over ideology.  Plus, in this world, communism wouldn't be the ""big threat;"" that would still be fascism. So the USSR would possibly be a somewhat tense ally of the US-led coalition, and Moscow and Washington could work together on smoothing out the chaos in China's internal politics.   I'm going to have to say that in this scenario, it is less likely that China would have turned communist.  edit: source -- I majored in Chinese studies and having been working in news (mostly political) for several years, but I'm still a novice when it comes to history! Feel free to correct any mistakes I've made."

imaginarymaps,2q2daz,alien6,2,Mon Dec 22 21:48:38 2014 UTC,"He got a lot of support from them in non-material ways. But don't forget that the communists and the nationalists put aside their differences for the better part of WWII in a bid to fend off the Japanese. Afterwards, relations between them deteriorated (I propose this is, among other reasons, closely related to the deterioration of relations between the USSR and the West). One important incidence of Soviet-CPC cooperation was the Japanese surrender of Mancuria, a huge swath of northeast China, which they gave to the USSR because China didn't have any forces there -- and which the USSR promptly handed over to Chinese communists instead of the Republic of China government."
imaginarymaps,2q2daz,G_Fil_24,5,Tue Dec 23 03:36:59 2014 UTC,"Overall: Japan is still defeated, Korea is occupied completely, there is no North or South Korea in here since the soviets were too busy fighting in Europe rather than in Manchuria.   Nope.  If Japan still has Germany as a trading partner, the US will have a tough time invading it, especially if they're also fighting in Europe.  Also, the Soviets had next to nothing in Manchuria until literally the last month of the war.   First of all, about Hitler conquering Europe completely, he never really wanted to ""annex"" Europe or turn it into a giant Germany, he wanted all European countries to turn fascist where he would lead the ""capital"" of this fascist UN-like Union (is this true)?   Hitler had very little in the way of concrete postwar plans for Europe.  He said different things regarding his plans at different times depending on the political realities that had developed.  The main issue with your scenario is the fall of the USSR.  It's not just going to lay down and die.  35 million Soviet soldiers were fielded during the war, and they had more than twice as many tanks as the Germans."

imaginarymaps,2q2daz,tooichan,5,Mon Dec 22 14:37:00 2014 UTC,"I don't want to burst bubbles but a Japan remaining undefeated all depends on your point of divergence. If the war had already been waged with Japan, and say the pod is somewhere in 1943 then by all means Japan would still lose.  The change would have to either be much earlier or have Germany succeed much earlier to have any impact in japan's economy. They had no feasible trade routes really at all. Opposite ends of the world, with hostile nations between them (USSR and China). Also, it's doubtful that Germany would even want to give Japan its oil and steel during the war cause they are more likely to want it themsevles than fight a ""proxy war"" in the Pacific where the end results were pretty much set in stone as soon as Japan bombed pearl harbor.  So a Japanese empire surviving depends on a few things but most Importantly depends on your point of divergence. It needs the infrastructure to produce ships, the resources to build them, and the oil to run them. If the only change is an axis victory in Europe post 1943 or even 1941 then nothing changes in the east because there was nothing Germany really could do, if you want to keep it realistic.

imaginarymaps,2q2daz,CharlesOfdenson,4,Mon Dec 22 16:19:35 2014 UTC,"A solid attempt, although I think France would be controlled by Germany and let's be honest, the only way the Nazi state was able to support itself was through conquest and huge wartime debts, it couldn't go on like that forever, so the most realistic axis victory map probably would be either no third reich or the reich would have to launch a complete turnaround of its economic policies VERY rapidly. Also, why is Japan still defeated? An axis victory map isn't an axis victory map with 1/3rd of the (main) axis powers still losing. As for Italy being a puppet state, from what I gathered Hitler was willing to respect Italian sovergnity and its ability to rule itself, as Hitler had a fair amount of respect for Mussolini and his fascist Italy, so I don't think Italy would have been a ""puppet"" state. I think Mussolini would have rather gone to war with Hitler than have his tremendous ego and delusional vision as a Roman Emperor ruling over the new Roman Empire suffer from being restrained and contained by the Germans. (Although undoubtedly the Germans would play an important role in influencing Italian politics). Italy would also control all of North Africa and the Mediteranean, there would be absolutley no allied influence left in the continent of Africa in the event of an axis victory, much less in Northern Africa or even in the Middle East. Also, Germany would for SURE have complete control over France (maybe southern parts of Italy) and Great Britain. Hitler was so paranoid about even his own government, I bet it was not even in his wildest imagination to set up a puppet government in former allies states (no matter how little true autonomy it had). He wanted centralized government, territorial expansion for GERMANY, not buffer/satellite states. Making an axis victory map is extremley difficult, first off, because it was impossible for the axis to have ever won the war, (yes, even if Hitler didn't invade Russia), and even if you changed the circumstances and advantages/disadvantages each side hide to start out with, their policies, their leadership (basically everything that made the war go the way it did) It would be impossible to predict how far each axis power would go in conquering, and what other sorts of resistance they would meet, or wouldn't meet, as they got farther and farther. You need a better understanding of the pre war factors, the idealogical views and ambitions of the axis leaders, and a full understanding of the geopolitical, economic, and a multitude of other elements of the axis countries, and the countries surrounding them.

imaginarymaps,2q2daz,JakeRCalvin,2,Mon Dec 22 15:43:26 2014 UTC,"There was a French civil war of sorts fought within WWII: Vichy France vs. Free France, and it was fought in the un-occupied colonies. The Free French forces (say that 3 times fast) won many of those battles, and when the US entered the war, they dedicated some troops to keep those territories out of the hands of the Axis.   And, of course, the US would occupy any Vichy French territory in North America, and would turn the governance over to the Free French. Same goes for Dutch Caribbean islands, and the French / Dutch possessions in South America. One of the Dutch possessions, probably one of the islands in the Netherland Antilles, would be the capital of The Free Netherlands. At any rate, absolutely nothing in the western hemisphere should be in Axis hands. Short of total defeat, the US would never ever allow it. Monroe Doctrine and all that.   Speaking of western hemisphere stuff, Brazil should be marked as an ally.  So this gives you the chance to make a couple of new countries, of sorts: The worldwide empire of Free France, led by the loveable Charles de Gaulle. This will make Africa and the Middle East much more complicated. And then the tiny new country of the Free Dutch.   What complicates Africa even further is how you define the time of German victory. In our history, the British keep the Germans out of Egypt. And then, in conjunction with the US invasion of Morocco, manage to seize all of North Africa. If this succeeds in your timeline, then there shouldn't be any Axis presence in Africa at all.  And it gets even more complicated because the Algerian War of Independence starts in 1954, in our timeline. The Empire of Free France is going to have far fewer resources to put down uprisings in her colonies, compared to even the weakened state of (our timeline) postwar France. On top of that, Free France is going to be largely bankrolled by the United States, and the United States has traditionally been hostile to European imperialism. So some of the French African territories might be independent by 1955 in this world. And perhaps could be listed as part of the allies, if the US convinces Free France to let them go without a fight.  You could have a similar amount of creativity and fun with how the UK colonies turn out in their own independence movements.   Greenland and Iceland will be firmly in the hands of the Allies and should not be marked as neutral. The UK occupied Iceland initially, then the US came in afterwards. And Greenland was similarly occupied. Both were very important in the Atlantic War, and would be crucial in a future naval war.  You have some room to be creative in the Middle East. Israel, as it is now, will not exist. However, there are still thousands of Zionists there (pre-WWII immigration and some wartime refugees who escaped the Nazis) and they may be strong enough to carve out an enclave of sorts. Or they may be forced to work with the Palestinians and create a Swiss-style confederation which somehow gets these people of different beliefs, languages, and ethnicities to work together. I think there's some room there for you to go a bit crazy if you like.   Same goes for the artificial borders created by the Imperial powers in the Middle East, and Africa too. There may not be a UN in your world, and while there probably is a cold war of sorts between the Axis and Allies, it's not the all-encompassing ideological war of ideas from our timeline. Therefore, there may not be the pressure to compel countries to keep the borders rigid.  In practice, this means you could do something like create a Kurdistan. Syria and Iraq gain their independence, but aren't strong enough to keep the Kurds in line, and there's no Soviet Union to give them money or to exist as a pressure for the US to give them money. Germany is tied down with an eternal guerrilla war with many of its occupied territories and will have little-to-no influence in the Middle East. Thus, the major powers just let things go without interfering.  Anyways, I liked your map. Hope this gives you more ideas on how to make it even more different in interesting ways. You could make world politics, especially in Third World countries, look completely different than it is now."

imaginarymaps,2pvabm,Uberbobo7,4,Sat Dec 20 23:24:26 2014 UTC,"That's entirely subjective. The Aztec, Inca and Maya were all civilizations (as in civilized people, as in having an organized non-tribal society) when the colonizers came. The only difference was their technological level (steel and gunpowder), natural resources (horses) and resistance to disease.  Had the Song dynasty China industrialized around 10th century (and it got close) it would easily have had all those advantages over the Europeans. It'd have high quality steel and gunpowder to fight Europeans who'd be fighting with basically iron weapons. It'd also have the Black death and other such diseases to spread among the Europeans which were still very deadly to them and caused mass death. Not to mention that if you look at civilization as you did to be a socio-technological thing, the difference between the industrialized Chinese state and feudal non-united Britain would be similar, if not greater, than that between the English and the Aztecs.  Not to mention that Europeans colonized even civilized countries like India, but they didn't fail at displacing the original inhabitants because of their ""civilizeness"" but rather because they didn't kill enough of them. All successful colonization (US, Australia) is based on genocide of the indigenous population in some form or another, and a technologically advanced Asia would have no problems with killing large numbers of Europeans through war and disease."
imaginarymaps,2pvabm,SpaceNavy,-1,Sun Dec 21 08:31:09 2014 UTC,"Much better retort than the other person. When I said relatively uncivilized, I was referring to the non politically correct term primitive culture.   In this case though, I was referring to the Japanese invading Britain. In all the years of conflict the French and English had, neither successfully each other for long. Which might explain why only part of the Isles is colonized. However, no matter where Japan would be staging the invasion with any number of troops and ships, the invasion would be practically impossible."
imaginarymaps,2pvabm,Uberbobo7,-1,Sun Dec 21 08:51:25 2014 UTC,"I don' t think it'd be impossible. The British wouldn't have naval supremacy with which to stop the Japanese and before they had a fleet strong enough to defeat invaders at sea they got conquered relatively easily.  Consider the Roman conquest where the legions killed massive numbers of Brits due to their superior military, or the Anglo-Saxon conquest of post-Roman Britain, or the Norse conquest and raiding, or finally the Norman conquest.  In all these cases (except Roman conquest) an established state already existed which was as advanced as the 10th century English state (hell, the Norman conquest happened in the 12th century), so it wouldn't be much of a stretch for a more advanced (civilized if you will) country to successfully invade."

Detail 1: http://i.imgur.com/q64LbTE.jpg Detail 1: http://i.imgur.com/B4UZDd1.jpg     History [I'm not such a good writer but I try my best]  Nyomythia [name of the world] has been different things before what she is now. In the beginning, she was a land that was tethered to the Abyss, cleft like clay by a greater demon, splitting fiery mountains, shattering the chains that moored her to her Abysmal quay. Asunder she drifted into the eventide like a burning galleon. Her horrid land took on a cone-shape, jagged, with mountains and vertex. Deepwuld, was her name, and she was ruled as a private underworld. The Heaven’s responded quickly to this imbalance of good and evil. The Dawning Spears [angel warriors] seized her and began purifying the depths of the soil with immense animate crystals. The angels secured a ring of protection in the center of the mountainous top-lands where the soil slowly began to turn green. To bolster their ranks, and to provide future leadership for inhabitants to come, mortals of every imaginable world joined the fight. Some were put to work under less than voluntary terms, as it was said that some suddenly appeared by treacherous magics, as was the case with one mentionable hero as history will show so it's important to say. Cul Kyriako, a young sage and first generation settler from a world known as Ryvennia was whisked away after reading an inscription on a mysterious jewel given to him by a cloaked stranger at a tavern. Later on, at the side of Nyomythus, he chronicled the war to cleanse the runaway world, The Deepwuld War. As Deepwuld died away, Lord Kyriako began a lineage of kings who brought a long age of peace to the new world. The animate crystals continued to grow beneath the soil; it forms the core, an ever compressing fractal sphere of diamond. Yet, green lands of tranquil abundance wane, as even under the untiring eyes of the Dawning Spears whom still watch over, the people of Nyomythia have rallied brethren against brethren and compete to expand  kingdoms, unearthing legendary things, and awakening dark sentiments. Moving along, Nyomythia looks like a flooded North America wrapped around in the shape of a ball. The ever compressing diamond core explains the world’s vortex-like stretching of the lands, and is the root of the seemingly inexplicable ocean maelstroms, armadas of which ride her strange currents. The world is born of much magic, and is still presumed to be endeared and protected by what appears more likely a capricious God, a God falling out of favor of the council of Elder Gods. For some ages with great efficacy in abating the evils out of which she sprang, Nyomythia has not seen intervention from the heavens in ages. The only evidence of divine influence can be seen at orbits height, as mentioned, the Dawning Spears patrol the skies with torches (think inverted Eiffel Towers x 10) illuminating a Sun-like light.    MORE WRITING Emergency Council Meeting of the Elder Gods   This is an example of the kind of politics at play, over the fate of what’s to come.   Elder God A, ""This is ridiculous! Now, they are saying this ...so-called liberation ...puts everything out of balance for them! They are demanding the return of this Deepwuld land, immediately, or there will be retaliatory terrors through out all the worlds! Who gave permission for this upstart to conscript the Dawning Spears and initiate this --""  Elder God B, ""You know very well who he is, and concerning the request for repatriation I strongly disagree. They initiated this chaos upon themselves; there will always be trouble with the forces of evil. Facing this challenge is what we do as Elder Gods! The intervention is already underway, that much was inevitable. If we grant this request then what’s to become of the mortals who have already left their home-worlds to make new homes here? This partition will be purified and formed into a new world, and it will be called Nyomythia. It will be inhabited by beings who are capable of making up their own individual choices about what’s right and wrong. This settles the question of alignment, balance. It will be a free world, not a part of the Underworlds or the Heavens, and therefore the other side stand to gain as much as we.""    Defenders of Darkness, Speech  A speech given by a lieutenant of the Greater Demon during the assault by the Dawning Spears  The Paradise that would poison this rightful nightmare has been halted! [roaring howl erupts from a sea of minions]. Never shall we bow to the virtue of Gods! Their resolve is in ancillary --because, because, if Gods had authority over us then how can I endure not their Master! [shield beating] Fill yourselves with the lust of worms of prey and erase this good-will from our homeland! Their Gods shall tremble! Our brutality will churn the wheels of war over the sprawled dead of them all! I am Aunggor, speaker of Ssrottbalo, beholder of the Doorway of Doom! [endless ranks wheel into formation and spear raise high among crimson banners].    A Mortal's Journal Entry  With Deepwuld unraveling and the green lands expanding and with much divine attention, a new generation of settlers begin arriving. Enter the journal of one Frer Trentinker, Gnome, Apprentice Silver Miner  My Gnome brothers began settling these new lands, as we called them then the Uplands, the green parts in the center. He was a human, very tall, a Magistrate, hmm, Hyronh was the fellow’s name I remember. He was an agent in charge of the question of immigration for my people. This Hyronh fellow was a good fellow, for a human. He came to the hall of my people on the old world looking for settlers. We were suspicious at first, but the Elder Gods spoke from the temples and we put our faith in him. We got him good and drunk, of course, as well, drunk enough to speak plainly about all this business. His words were honest, and at the notion of settling on a new world, away from old enemies , whom ever seemed to grow more in number, well, it appealed to many of us, especially young one’s such as I and me lady.    Chronology   Ssrottbalo is given dominion over the Deepwuld region of the Abyss. The Deepwuld Rebellion, Deepwuld is sundered from the Abyss, activation of the Doorway of Doom. Deepwuld becomes a new underworld setting the Heavens and all the Underworlds out of balance. Deepwuld becomes a ward of a Council of Elder Gods. Nyomythus conscripts the Dawning Spears, the Uplands form. The Deepwuld War, death of Ssarrottbalo, Aunggor, and Sylenn. First generation settlers arrive on the Uplands. What was Deepwuld is now green and is reformed into a sphere and is now known as Nyomythia. Settlements become kingdoms. Kingdoms vey for Empires and war returns."

One thing that looks unnatural to me: all the coastlines are jagged in the same way, on the same scale. The geology of the world in this map has a preference for making bays and peninsulas of a certain size, apparently. Every coastline is covered in bays of the same size.  Real coastlines look ""fractal""; if you zoom in on a coastline, the result also looks like a coastline, because there are features at every size. So I think a world like this needs more smooth coastlines, more fine points, more surprising features like Cape Cod."

imaginarymaps,2ow8gc,nyomythe,5,Thu Dec 11 05:02:06 2014 UTC,"Nice map. A couple of comments:  Island chains scattered across a wide area, like you might see in the Aegean are rareish; it is even rarer that these islands are all roughly the same size. Island lines andarcs, like you have in the southeast corner of your map, are much more common, since they can be formed by a variety of erosive or depositional processes, hot spot volcanism, and of course plate tectonics. Of course, if your world doesn't have volcanism due to hot spots and plate tectonics, its islands will look different; Sundaland is a good example of islands formed from the inundation of low-lying continental regions.  Your landforms betray the fact that they were drawn to fit the dimensions of the canvas they're on; the west and northern margins are particularly squared. The terrain also appears to be closely modeled on Earth's, down to a ""new world"" divided by a narrow isthmus (with an island-filled sea to the east), an ""old world"" whose west is centered around a large inland sea, a far east at whose edge is a large arc-shaped region, and a south polar continent. In this, it rather reminds me of the Warhammer world map.  If the parallel is intentional, by all means keep it. If not, you might think about revising the general disposition of your continents."

Huey Long (or ""Buzz Windrip"") promises lots of redistribution, but he also brings some militarist thugs into power.He forces a number of constitutional amendments that un-check presidential power, including castrating Congress and abolishing the states in favor of top-down administrative provinces (seen here).  After some twists and turns, an analogue for Douglas MacArthur siezes the presidency in a coup. He cuts off most of the redistribution and starts a war with Mexico. This finally breaks the back of the new regime, and the country descends into civil war (but not regional, as the map suggests).  Edit: For those who are complaining about the boundaries, that's a key point in the book. Windrip tears up the checks and balances of the constitution, but the thing that makes Americans really mad is when he abolishes state identities. These boundaries frustrate people within the book, and they make it easier for Windrip's ""corpo"" (corporatist) thugs to divide and conquer the population."

I don't study this, so I don't really know citations -- I assume the Wikipedia references are helpful?  My understanding is that we're technically in an ice age now because we have significant glaciation. It's just less than it can be, so it's an ""interglacial"" period.  Specific lines from there:   A ""greenhouse earth"" or ""hothouse earth"" is a period in which there are no continental glaciers whatsoever on the planet ... the Earth has been in this state for approximately 80% of the past 500 million years   and    Currently, the Earth is in an icehouse climate state. About 34 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in Antarctica; the ice sheets in the Arctic did not start forming until 2 million years ago   Some other informal sources that seem relevant: 1, 2.  I actually erred -- I meant the ""relatively recent"" past. I don't know anything about what was going on billions of years ago.   edit: The ice age article has some stuff to go on too, but there might be an author overlap issue:   There have been at least five major ice ages in the earth's past (the Huronian, Cryogenian, Andean-Saharan, Karoo Ice Age and the Quaternary glaciation). Outside these ages, the Earth seems to have been ice-free even in high latitudes.   I'd be happy to be corrected by someone who knows more about this stuff than me!"

imaginarymaps,2nvy4g,B-Bann,3,Mon Dec 1 15:10:43 2014 UTC,"My understanding is: Both glacial and interglacial periods have an Earth with glaciers -- glacial periods just have more of them. The last glacial period was a 20,000+ years ago, we're in an interglacial now.   Both of these types of periods happen within ""ice ages"" where there is significant ice coverage. And within ice ages, glacial periods (I think?) dominate. However, that doesn't exhaust the possibilities -- there's a third type of state for the Earth in which there is basically no glaciation (i.e. not an ice age). My claim was that this third state is actually the dominant one.  I don't really know citations, but this is at least backed up by the ice age and greenhouse earth Wikipedia pages. See my other comment for quotes from those.  I may well misunderstand -- the last time I had any kind of Earth sciences type education was ten years ago and I only have a popular science kind of view here."

The Ottoman Empire covered more territory than shown on that map.  Would not the expectation be that the Ottoman empire would have extended far into Africa by the mid-19th century if Europe hadn't interfered with them?  It may have grown too large and fractured? The Ottaman empire expended rapidly until ~1600. Why did it stop? European influence? Or was it other factors.  Perhaps without European influence, by the mid-19th, we'd see numerous caliphates fighting for dominance. Empires do not tend to last, particularly ones built on conquest.  I like these what-ifs."

When the mask and texture are applied together, you get the shape of the country with the design of the flag.  repeat ad nauseam for the flags you wish to depict."
imaginarymaps,2nb74k,adarias,6,Tue Nov 25 00:41:30 2014 UTC,"I would use Gimp, because it's free and it's the software with which I'm most familiar.  The process for making a flag map in Photoshop would be very similar to the one detailed below.  Making a flag map in Paint or something would be much harder.  How to Make a Flag Map in Gimp:   Create your basic map.  This should have just the borders of the countries - no town names or anything, just solid white spaces surrounded by continuous black borders.  This can be done by a variety of methods not covered in this guide.  For help with this step, consult other guides on /r/imaginarymaps or possibly /r/worldbuilding. Create a separate image file for each flag.  Like Step 1, this guide does not cover flag design. Open your basic map from Step 1 in Gimp. Press Control+Alt+O to use the ""Open as layer"" command. Select the image file of one of your countries and press ""Open."" Use the Scale Tool, and the Move Tool to position the flag over it's country.  The flag should be roughly centered on the middle of the country, and should overlap all borders slightly. TIP: Hold Shift while using the Scale Tool to preserve the aspect ratio (Prevent the flag from getting squashed or stretched.) In the Layers Panel, you should see 2 layers listed: your basic map (named ""Background"" by default) and the flag (named ""New Layer"" by default).  Click the Layer Visibility icon next to the flag layer.  (The icon looks like an eyeball.) This will temporarily hide the flag, allowing you to work on the background. TIP: To make the Flag layer visible again, click the now-empty box where the Layer Visibility icon was before. Optional Step: Double-click the name of each layer and give it a more helpful name, eg. ""Estonia"" instead of ""New Layer."" Select the Magic Wand Tool. Click on the interior of the country that corresponds to the flag added in Step 5.  This should select the entire area within the borders, but not the border itself or any surrounding areas. Hit Control-X if you are using a windows machine, or Command-X on a mac, to cut the country to the clipboard. Re-enable the visibility of your flag layer.  See the tip below Step 7 for how to re-enable layer visibility. In the Layers Panel, right click on the flag layer.  In the menu that appears, select ""Add Layer Mask.""  Select ""Black (Full Transparency)"" and click ""Add."" In the Layers Panel, there should now be two thumbnail images for the flag layer - one showing the flag, and one showing an all-black field.  Right click on the layer again.  Note that ""Edit layer mask"" is enabled.  So long as ""Edit layer mask"" is enabled, any changes you make to the image will affect which parts of the flag layer are visible, and NOT rest of the image.  Select ""Show layer mask."" TIP: Layer masks are like a silhouette of their layer.  If you make a black circle on the Layer Mask, then a circular area of that layer will become invisible - your flag would have a round hole in it.  If you fill the entire layer mask with black (as we did in Step 12), the entire flag layer will be invisible. Press Control+V to paste the shape of your country into the mask of the flag layer.  You should now see the white shape of your country on a black background. Right Click on your flag layer again.  Deselect ""Edit layer mask."" Right Click on your flag layer again.  Deselect ""Show layer mask."" If all has gone well, one of the countries on your map should now look like the ""Flag Map"" you expect.  Repeat Steps 4 - 16 for each of the remaining countries on your map.  As with any project, make sure to save frequently, and don't overwrite your old saves, in case you need to revert to an older iteration. When you're completely done, save your file one last time.  Then go to File->Export, and save your file with the .png extension.  (The default export settings are fine.)  This will give you a nice version of your map, that can be put online, emailed, printed, etc.   Feel free to post a comment if you run into any problems, if you run into any unexpected behavior, or if you'd like me to explain more of the logic of what you're doing beyond just the step-by-step.  I hope that helps!"

Cross-posted from /r/MapPorn, I wasn't sure if this map was suitable for this subreddit, but I put it here as it is in essence an imaginary map."

imaginarymaps,2mxozm,Lord_Wrath,2,Fri Nov 21 01:00:50 2014 UTC,"There's another thing you need to take into account when making fictional maps: CLIMATE  Don't just make a Patchwork Map. Distinct geographic locales have different climates for a reason.  For example, on Earth's temperate regions, seasons follow a pattern that's directly influenced by location relative to prevailing winds. West coasts have a Mediterranean (dry summers and wet winters) or Oceanic climate, while east coasts usually have a Humid Subtropical (wet summers and dry winters) or Continental climate. Also, most deserts are located at the rain shadow west of Humid Subtropical locations.  Note also how most of Earth's population is located in Humid Subtropical climates, as they tend to be able to support high-yield crops such as rice. However, most developed societies are located in relatively colder climates and higher latitudes (and tropical locations, with their hot, damp, disease-ridden, difficult to farm environments, are most often the least developed).  Also, rivers, which may turn otherwise desert lands such as Egypt and Mesopotamia into fertile lands suitable for civilization. Of course, they originate in high mountains that get plenty of precipitation.  Of course, none of these patterns may apply in your imaginary world, but you have to think about how the land will be able to support, first a thriving population, then an advanced civilization."

imaginarymaps,2msgix,ZombineTM,53,Wed Nov 19 17:55:44 2014 UTC,"I will never understand why everyone assumes that if the axis powers weren't hastily defeated, they would have not only conquered most of the world, but dissolved most if not all of the existing borders and ruled with an iron fist.  Occupying enemy nations is extremely difficult, and you need more than bombs and bodies to do so.  Imagine how difficult it is for most nations to organize their own governance.  Now multiply that by 10.  This is especially true when populations are large and far from the home nation.  Germany and Japan would have both imploded during the late 40's -- all occupied territories would stand in open rebellion, and war-weary populations at home would also protest, if they didn't go straight to revolution.  But let's assume none of that is true -- that the axis powers had inexhaustible resources and nations once defeated in battle were easily governed -- why are the much easier targets of Canada and Latin America practically ignored?  Coming at the US by land would be infinitely easier than challenging the American navy, and there was a relatively strong pro-nazi movement in several of those places.  Also Russia makes no sense.  They could not have defeated Germany outright in a single-front war, but they could have forced a war of attrition that would have exhausted German supplies and desire to fight.  Surrender seems far-fetched.  Japan pulling Russia into a two-front war would have complicated this, but that's not represented, and Siberia would have exhausted the Japanese war machine as well, preventing most of the conquests depicted.    Since you asked for a realistic alternative....any ""realistic"" Axis victory scenario would simply represent the opening scenes of WWIII.  The aftermath of WWIII, assuming we didn't nuke the world, would be the balkanization of most of central and eastern Europe (including southern Germany and Italy), as well as the rise of Maoist China, which by 1940 was almost inevitable regardless of who claimed to be in control of the country.  Points of interest would include the possible absence of the iron curtain (since victory in WWII is what allowed its creation), independence for former british territories, and the relatively high probability of an independent Occitan or Catalan nation emerging (depending on how the fronts move, how quickly and firmly the french resistance consolidated, and whether franco could remain isolated in the aftermath of a british defeat in WWII.)    Western and Southern Africa would probably benefit the most, due to a massive influx of educated and/or affluent individuals fleeing other nations combined with increased self-direction resulting from the weakening or outright collapse of various political, military, and economic powers that inhibited growth there during the 20th century.  The Middle-east and North Africa would receive some of the same benefits, but would also be dragged into the fighting and probably have to deal with a variety of governments-in-exile which could have serious consequences in the WWIII phase."

imaginarymaps,2msgix,xXTheGrapenatorXx,12,Thu Nov 20 20:40:01 2014 UTC,"I always wonder why people think the United States would be divided in an Axis victory. The Japanese would have annexed Hawaii and our other Pacific holdings, but the Continental US would remain in tact. In fact, Hitler did not envision a German invasion of the US per say. He predicted a war with America beyond his lifetime, but in this vision, it would the forces of the UK attacking the United States. More so, in this map, Nazi Germany annexes Western Europe and the Balkans. This ignores that German and Spain had positive relations, so they would not have attacked Spain. They also had Romania and Hungary as Balkan allies, and again, would not have invaded them. The Nazis plan was to create a contiguous imperial state, almost like a mix of the British Empire and the United States. They knew it would take generations just to populate Eastern Europe. In the West, they planned a New Order, but it would still have featured independent nations. The same goes for Japan. Do you think they really had the resources to annex India? They dreamt of a Japanese equivalent to the British Empire, but like the British, they did not plan to populate the entire thing. They would have used the same style of puppet governments that the Nazis planned. A modern example of what this would have looked like is the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and if you wanted to be edgy, perhaps even early post-war NATO. Of course, all of this is assuming the Axis governments wouldn't collapse in the massive economic disaster that would have come after their victories."
imaginarymaps,2msgix,BlazingNipples,10,Thu Nov 20 00:10:08 2014 UTC,"Japan couldn't have even annexed Hawaii, much less California or Australia.   To invade Hawaii would mean first thoroughly crushing the US Navy in the Pacific. And then Japan would have to dedicate the vast majority of the IJN to the invasion effort. Even with their fleets decimated, the US could still use Hawaii as an unsinkable aircraft carrier and would cause heavy losses in the invasion fleet.   Assuming Japan pulls off a miracle and their forces manage to maintain a foothold on a Hawaiian island, they're still going to have a problem with logistics. If you look at a map, Hawaii is a very long ways away from any Japanese-held territory. They're going to have to use the majority of their freighters over a long sea route which will be swarmed by American submarines. And since Japan never mastered convoy tactics, their freighters are going to have a bad time, just like they did in our timeline.  If you want a real life example, look at what happened at Guadalcanal. Japan wins or ties many of the initial sea battles. For a time, they basically have control of the seas around the island. Lands a sizeable force to push out the US Marines, but the tiny number of planes at the Marines disposal puts enough pressure on Japan's logistical efforts that they resort to using subs and destroyers to carry supplies to the 15,000+ on the island. And this, to put it mildly, does not work well.   This is a significantly smaller force than would be needed for the Hawaiian Islands, and Guadalcanal is practically in the back yard of several major Japanese bases and with a relatively short-distance supply line. And the Japanese could not pull it off.   As for Germany, let's remember they didn't have the naval or air capacity to invade Britain even though the British Isles are just 30 miles off the coast of occupied France. Invading North America? It's good for a laugh.  In the bigger picture, these alt-history folks fail to realize the United States industrial capacity was more than Japan + Germany combined. The only way the world would look anything like this map is if the Germans and the Japanese managed to put hallucinogens in the American water supply and everybody was too busy hallucinating the Andrews Sisters in suggestive poses to notice anything at all."
imaginarymaps,2msgix,PrivateIdahoGhola,7,Thu Nov 20 00:41:51 2014 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. In reality, there would never have been a successful Axis invasion of America. Can you even imagine such a war?The Germans didn't expect to push beyond the Urals, how in the hell were they supposed to push past the Appalachians? This map for this game for example shows Japan with land past the Mississippi, but that is just insane. They'd have to somehow get past the Rockies, the rugged South Western desert, and they'd do it faster than a German invasion of the East? It's amazing to think multi-million dollar games like this wouldn't employ a single person who would at least hold them to a shred of realism.

I think the reason why the entire world are in repetitive colors in an Axis Victory is because people take the dictator stereotype of invading everywhere too seriously."
imaginarymaps,2msgix,PrivateIdahoGhola,8,Thu Nov 20 00:32:32 2014 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point:_Fall_of_Liberty  Alright here we go again:  In 1931, during a visit to NYC, Churchill was hit by a NYC Cab, he was hurt, but nothing major happened, TP dives onto the world where Churchill died this day after being hit.  Just remember, Churchill is no more as of this timeline.  In 1939, WWII begins, and the UK declares war normally to Hitler, without his foresight and leadership, the United Kingdom falls to the Third Reich in 1940 after the British Royal Air Force was defeated by the German Luftwaffe, achieving air supremacy, and Operation Sea Lion was successful, forcing Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to surrender to Nazi Germany.  Operation Barbarossa started some years later, unhampered, now with much of the UK's supply, the Nazis gather large amounts of territory and many Russian cities, including Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Moscow. After numerous German victories decimate the disorganized Russians, the Red Army and Joseph Stalin surrender to the Wehrmacht and Adolf Hitler. The non-aggression pact Stalin made with Germany prior to the invasion left him without any allies to back him up.   The Nazis also help their Italian allies conquer North Africa, creating Benito Mussolini's ""New Roman Empire"", Germany now owns many of Europe's colonies, he also conquers much of Africa and starts a genocide against black africans.  Meanwhile, Japan goes absolutely apeshit and sweeps through Asia unopposed using Germany's captured Middle Eastern and Soviet oil, which makes any U.S. oil embargo against Japan useless, China falls to Japan, and with the help of German Troops stationed in the Indian Ocean, Australia and New Zealand are invaded and defeated by Japan, with the last places with UK's political system in ruins, an axis-backed Indian Revolution happens successfully, and India gains independence for a short time, as Japan invades it without a sweat and the recently-formed Independent Indian Army is shown to be weak, with almost the entire Asiatic continent under Japanese rule, the Greater East Asiatic and Pacific Empire is established, sort of a ""United Asia against western imperialism and colonialism"", rather than a fucking massive Japan, however, i heard that Japan did had some plans to annex other parts of Asia, is this true?  During the war, the United States chose an isolationist policy, implemented by Republican president Thomas E. Dewey (who defeated Harry S. Truman in 1948), the war is declared over, with the Axis victorious, and a period of development follows the success of the Axis Powers, transforming conquered Europe, Asia and Africa into the Greater German Reich and allowing allies Japan and Italy to share in the prosperity; at the same time, the Nazis start engineering and mass-producing many of their Wunderwaffen, including advanced assault rifles and firearms, rocket launchers, mech-like armor, jet fighters, super-heavy tanks, and high-tech bombers. This advanced technology makes Germany the strongest nation on the planet. Since the war is essentially over, the people of the world wonder why the weapons are being developed, and what is the purpose of the build-up. This causes rising tensions between the now technologically superior German Reich and the United States, one of the few nations that is still free from Nazi rule. The United States and the rest of the League of Nations continue to condemn the actions of Nazi Germany in the occupied territories, but make no attempts to stop them, as the U.S. is still dominated by anti-war sentiment, and no one wants to intimidate any of the Axis.  When secret plans for an American invasion by German and Japanese forces are found by the British Resistance, codenamed Operation Humpback Whale, Germany and Japan are quick to deny it, saying these accusations are ludicrous. President Dewey believes their lies, and continues his isolationist policies, refusing to stock up on arms and increase the size of the military in case of a possible invasion. The invasion plans turn out to be true, however, and Operation Humpback Whale (nicknamed Blitzkrieg Amerika) is launched in 1953, with German (and Italian?) forces invading the East Coast through NYC, and the ""Asiatic Empire"" invading the West Coast through California, the player plays as Dan Carson, a construction worker in the middle of the chaos in NYC who survives the attack by defending himself against the nazis with his own hands (i.e. the gameplay).  After he learns that the US Surrendered, and had been divided into the ""Amerikanenreich"" on the East Coast, and ""Pacific America"" on the West, he hears about German plans to build an atomic bomb, once and for all being able to control the entire world, he joins the resistance to stop the Nazi Nuclear Program, the game is set in NYC, D.C. and London only, sadly, and only Nazis and seen through the game.  TL;DR No Churchill for the UK, UK loses, US is neutral in WWII, Axis win WWII, start developing nuclear arms after they won to conquer the rest of what's free in the world.  The game is pretty weak overall, not ""horrible"", just cliché, the game was very much ignored and got reviews like 5.7/10, 4.1/10, 2/5, etc.  Of fucking course, lots of wrong things here, let's see if we can do something realistically, well, do you guys know what's the most ""realistic"" axis victory map?"

The British Empire combined with the US, Japan (possibly with large swathes of Chinese land if WW2 never happened), possibly France and the support of rebels in occupied territories could have easily held off a USSR with German control of Germany.

Without Hitler, the NDSAP was extremely weak and ignored, and went down in 1923, without it, the Communist Party of Germany grew to the extreme, and successfully had a socialist revolution against the Weimar governament in 1930.

Stalin had also started funding communist parties in Latin America in the late 50's to increase the spread of communism, Colombia's, Argentina's, and Bolivia's revolutions where much more successful. for some reason, Stalin saw Jews as enemies of communism, and they were ordered to be disposed of, pretty much, the holocaust would still have happened.  After these incidents, the still-imperial Japan and the US became the only countries in the world that saw Communism as a threat, they had no choice but to unite against the USSR for years without declaring war at them directly.  Nuclear Weapons are created in the 60's, the Cuban Missle Crisis happened normally, this time by the ultra-big Latino Socialist Republic, the US-Mexico border became the equivalent to North and South Korea  The novel then proceeds onto this 60's-70's cultural cold war period where Japan and the US are resisting against the USSR while the world faces destruction with this nuclear holocaust.  Like i said previously on my r/TIL post, this timeline is similiar to Red Alert: No Hitler, Weak NDSAP, no WWII, Soviet power grows and starts WWIIA, but this time, no nations had interfered with their invasions, instead of in Red Alert where the Allies unite the same way as in the OTLWWII.  The other ones i can imagine are NDSAP without Hitler, go onto power anyways with different leader, WWII happens normally with few changes.  Or NDSAP goes without Hitler, goes into power with extremely intelligent leader (like in Making History), Axis conquer everything under control of this smarter leader."

There's a case to be made that this is recruiting propaganda for uneducated audiences; you see some of the country you hate in the caliphate they're promising, you start to feel like these guys might be what you're looking for.  As such they scatter caliphate-to-be across two categories.  There are intensely Muslim regions like Indonesia, because those ideas are less insane and will appeal to some of the many Muslims living there.  Then there are intensely ""Western"" regions like America, Britain, and Australia.  Those suggestions are completely absurd, but each place earns them points with the people who say ""Wait yeah, I hate those bastards!""  So the most interesting answer, to me, is that they're not at all serious.  At least the leadership knows this is impossible, but they also know it's a great recruiting tool.

imaginarymaps,2me9ub,CascadianAtHeart,5,Sat Nov 15 18:17:46 2014 UTC,"A surprising amount of you have reached out to me via message over the past month or so regarding the maps I posted this summer. They depicted North America with re-imagined nations based on environmental (bioregional) trends, history, and cultural distinctiveness.  I took my old ones down because I wasn't quite happy with them.  I've since uploaded a newer version with borders and flags I'm happier with and thought I'd post again on this sub.  Here's another version where the nations are filled with solid color instead: http://i.imgur.com/wQ9xIz9.png  I did this all in my free time just for fun.  Here are some noteworthy points about the borders if you're scratching your head wondering why I made them as such:  Bermuda - No changes.  California - Sacramento & San Joaquin valleys bordered by the Sierra Nevada mountains (All of Lake Tahoe is in Deseret).  Encompasses the area west of the Mojave Desert - the border follows the mountains until they reach the Colorado River, which separates southern California from Sonora.   Includes Baja California & Baja California Sur.  Cascadia - Northern border is Mt. Logan (w/ Yukon Alaska). The mountains continue until they reach the Great Continental Divide, which is most of Cascadia's eastern border.  The border turns at Yellowstone to encompass the Snake River Valley, comes up into Oregon so to not intersect the Great Basin, and turns south around Klamath into California until it reaches Cape Mendocino.  It encompasses the western half of the State of Jefferson.  Caribbean Islands - Exclude Cuba & The Bahamas.  Central America - Combines Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.  Cuba - No changes.  Deseret - Encompasses most of the Great Basin.  Eastern border is the Great Continental Divide.  Southern border is the Gunnison River in the east until it junctions with the Colorado River.  Desert contains Lake Tahoe & Joshua Tree to the west and Las Vegas to the south.  Dixie - Follows the borders of Virginia (does not include Northampton or Accomack counties, which lie east of the Chesapeake) up through to the Ohio River (northern border of Kentucky).  The border goes up the Mississippi River until it hits the Missouri River just north of St. Louis, which is in Dixie.  It follows the Missouri out to the Osage and then cross west until it hits the current day border of southern Missouri.  It then goes south to follow the existing borders of Arkansas and Louisiana.  Includes all of Florida except for the Everglade region.  Everglade & The Bahamas - Self-explanatory.  Great Plains - Starting the junction of the Missouri & Mississippi just north of St. Louis, the border follows the Mississippi River north.  It then goes west and north to all Laurentia to cover the Great Lakes.  It goes up to Hudson Bay and comes back down to encompass the Nelson River, Lake Manitoba, and Lake Winnipeg.  The northern border then follows existing municipality lines in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and eastern British Columbia which separate the Prairies from the Boreal Forest in the north.  The Great Plains encompasses Lake Williston, just east of Cascadia.   The border follows the Great Continental Divide south until it hits Texas, at which it turns east and follows the modern-day borders of Texas.  Greenland - No changes.  Hawai’ian Islands - No changes.  Laurentia - Read the sections on Dixie and Great Plains first. Laurentia’s eastern border encompasses Fairfield county, CT (Greenwich), but then follows the existing borders of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont.  It turns west at Quebec and follows that existing border, encompassing Ottawa, and going north until it hits the Canadian Shield/Boreal Forest. It then proceeds west again following existing municipality lines, which separate the Great Lakes region from the Boreal Forest.  Mexico - Present day country minus the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, and Sonora.  New England - Combines Connecticut (minus Fairfield County), Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland.  Nunavut & Labrador - Encompasses the Arctic & Boreal Forest areas east of the Great Continental Divide.  Quebec - Present day state, excluding the Boreal Forest/traditional Cree lands in the northwest.  The northern border roughly follows existing municipality lines which separate these two areas.  Sonora - Read the sections on California, Desert, Great Plains, and Mexico first.  Encompasses the Sonora & Chihuahua Deserts.   Eastern border in the north is the Great Continental Divide until it hits the Pecos River, to which follows down to the Rio Grande.  Includes far western counties of modern-day Texas and the city of El Paso.  Texas - Modern day borders, with the exception that the northern Panhandle proceeds further west until it hits the Great Continental Divide.  The border goes south to follow the Pecos River until it hits the Rio Grande and proceeds southeast to the Gulf of Mexico.  Yukon Alaska - Read the section on Cascadia first. Excludes modern-day southeastern panhandle, which is Cascadian.  The border follows Cascadia southeast until it hits the Great Continental Divide and follows it north up to the Arctic Ocean.  Hope you guys like this.  I’m going to try and leave these images up online for good this time.  Bonus: The only other map I currently have online is, true to my username, one which highlights Cascadia alongside the United States & Canada as we know them today:  http://i.imgur.com/dupzVwz.png"

imaginarymaps,2me9ub,Hominid77777,2,Sat Nov 15 20:22:18 2014 UTC,So does New England.
imaginarymaps,2me9ub,RedNorth12,1 point,Sat Dec 6 01:00:51 2014 UTC,"Can you explain that?   The only French settlements New England were in Maine, which was previously part of Acadia.   Nova Scotia was first claimed by the Scots in 1625. Cape Breton and Saint John's Island (modern day PEI) were settled by thousands of Gaelic speaking Scots, the language is still spoken in Cape Breton.   Newfoundland, having been widely disputed by the French, English and Portuguese, was settled predominately by Irish and Scottish settlers.   How does New England in what is the U.S. have cultural inheritance and similarity to the Scots, Irish and French? New England should be separate from the Maritimes in this map for that reason alone."
imaginarymaps,2me9ub,Hominid77777,2,Sat Dec 6 05:51:35 2014 UTC,"In colonial times, sure. But there was lots of Irish and French Canadian immigration to New England in the 19th century, the descendents of which make up a very large percentage of New England's population today. Also, this map is not supposed to be 100% scientific."
imaginarymaps,2me9ub,RedNorth12,1 point,Sat Dec 6 07:13:28 2014 UTC,"I understand the the regions depicted in this map are not meant to be 100% accurate or even historically regulated, infact, many regions depend on a form of alternate history occurring if they were to form naturally. That being said, there is nothing the modern sense that would make this New England possible, as well as quite likely in any historical context, alternate or reality.  However, although the populace of several regions might not like it, I could such a union happening, but only if it's name weren't New England."
imaginarymaps,2me9ub,Sumizone,3,Sat Dec 6 16:03:33 2014 UTC,Several people here have mentioned splitting Cascadia.  I think your borders are the best.  You can't have the west without the east.  Neither side would be able to economically function without the other as an independent state.

I think It would be much more likely for Las Vegas and the Tahoe and Washoe County areas (Reno is in Washoe County) to be in the California state than the Deseret state, just based on how they usually swing politically, as well as local culture. Reno/Tahoe has a lot more in common with Northern California, and Las Vegas has a lot more in common with Southern California, than either do to Utah."

As I remember it, please correct me if I am wrong, Nevada was apart of the Utah territory and the original plan to make Deseret included Nevada. There are some small towns in Nevada that are still culturally similar to Utah but yeah the urban and much more populated areas share little in common with the rest of Deseret. In my opinion it should either be its own country or apart of California."

imaginarymaps,2me9ub,nix831,2,Sun Nov 16 13:14:10 2014 UTC,"Though I appreciate your time and effort, the current Cascadia discussion is more about the north-south border than the east-west. Personally, I think it doesn't reach Alaska, maybe not even northern British Columbia. I'm not alone either. It's a very touchy issue.   However Eastern Washington, Idaho, and Southern & Eastern Oregon could never be in Cascadia. It just wouldn't work. An inland State of Jefferson could work well here, certainly the north-eastern border going along the Bitterroot mountain range/continental divide.  And Northern Virginia most definitely should be in Laurentia. Have you ever been there? Fairfax County & Arlington VA =/= the rest of Virginia. They are just extended suburbs of Washington D.C."

That's a big point of a theoretical breakaway - a disappointment at the lack of any action from Washington D.C.  But that's one opinion. The smaller and more culturally/socially/politically unified, the better. It doesn't mean shutting away from all others, but more about being able to be govern smoothly."

imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,uncannylizard,10,Mon Nov 10 20:31:39 2014 UTC,"Another facts:  After the US got away from the Middle East in 2012A, severe infighting between Shia's and Sunni's broke out, Iraq was divided into three states, a Sunni, an either Pro-Saudi Sunni or Pro-Iran Shi'a, and Kurdistan (this was in 2011, Kaos Studios is famous for making games that predict the future, holy fuck).  Iran invaded northern Iraq in 2015 to ""protect"" the Shi'a population, in response, Saudi Arabia did the same with the Sunnis, this caused a severe war between each countries that damaged oil pipelines, causing a worldwide oil crisis, the entire Middle East was completely destroyed by Nuclear Warfare by the end of 2020, Israel became a terrorist paradise after the US got away from the ME, Palestine was formed again for short, but everything went boom, after the holy site of Mecca was destroyed, of course everyone went apeshit everywhere, terrorist attacks ravaged in the entire world, and a majority of the remaning muslims commited mass suicide, Islam is now considered an extinct religion as of 2026, and ""members"" are considered cultists or terrorists only.  Ukraine did not had a revolution in 2013A (2015 in the game) because of its pro-Putin government, and instead, it signed a ""mutual interest pact"", keeping their oil and natural gas between the two nations, also cutting off all such trade with the rest of Europe, so, no Crimea, no war, Ukraine is still pro-Putin.  Venezuela and Cuba (possibly S. America?, no mention of other socialist countries in SA) funded the invasion of America by the GKR, Cuba took Guantánamo Bay back to themselves in 2026, and are also planning on taking part of the occupation, or invading through the Caribbean."
imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,releasethedogs,2,Sun Nov 9 23:47:32 2014 UTC,"Iran's response is possible if ISIS manage to take Baghdad, although a direct military response by Saudi Arabia is unlikely, they would most likely support ISIS through weapons and Intel if anything. The Saudis don't like ISIS either at least for now, although if they have to choose between a terrorist neighbour or a shia hegemony they might choose ISIS. Scary stuff"
imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,lewwatt,9,Mon Nov 10 00:47:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah, those things aren't going to happen.  A) Iran is first and foremost a nation state, like Turkey or France is. It doesn't make sense to take over territory populated overwhelmingly by arabic speaking arabs who don't have a shared history or culture with Iran. Iran isn't an empire. Iran and Shia Iraq share a religion, but that isn't the basis of the Iranian state. If Iran were interested in incorporating territory it would sooner go towards Afghanistan than Iraq since Afghans or perhaps Iraqi Kurdistan since Afghanis and Kurds are historically Iranian people and are closely connected to Persians, the major ethnicity in Iran.   In terms of geopolitics, Iran is happy to prop up the Iraqi government, preferably as a whole, but if the Sunni areas are permanently lost to ISIS, then they will prop up the government that controls Shia and Kurdish areas. They are already allies with the government. They don't need to annex that territory. They wouldn't gain anything. Iran is very happy to extend its power through proxies, through maintaining its alliances with the Iraqi, Afghani, and Syrian governments, and with groups in Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, and Bahrain.   B) Baghdad will never fall to ISIS. ISIS can't even take over small Shia towns, Baghdad is majority Shia and has millions of people and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. It would be like the KKK trying to take over Cape Town. Taking over disgruntled Sunni territories is one thing, but attempting to take over the largest city in the country with the entire military stationed there and a population that will literally die to the last person to kill you is an entirely different thing."
imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,releasethedogs,3,Mon Nov 10 03:17:43 2014 UTC,"I agree with B if you're talking about a conventional military campaign. That is not ISIS' plan. What they are doing is controlling all the area around Baghdad for a hundred or more miles. This allows them to control what and who goes in and what comes out. They already do this with the road from Jordan. Baghdad is not self sustaining. It needs imports of food and more importantly water to survive. If ISIS controls these things, eventually they will take Baghdad. This is how they took Mosul, a city of over 2 million people."

imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,uncannylizard,1 point,Mon Nov 10 08:17:54 2014 UTC,"Mosul is a city of 2 million Sunnis. Thats why it got rolled over. Sunnis don't like being ruled by a Shia government. When ISIS came there was no resistance once the Shiite soldiers fled. All of ISIS successes have happened in Sunni Arab areas. But look what happens when they go out of their natural area. They are trying to take this medium-small city called Kobani in Syria. A city populated by Sunnis like them, but instead of Arabs they are Kurds, who prize their ethnic identity above their religious affiliation. They have been fighting for a month now and they still have not taken the city.  Baghdad is many many times more difficult to take than Kobane. It is full of millions of Shiites, it is mostly Shiites. ISIS kills all Shiites that it comes across. It executes them on the spot. Baghdad is also swarming with Shiite militias, military units who are much more ferocious and motivated than government soldiers. Baghdad is also backed by the USA and by Iran, both of which have an enormous stake in Baghdad's resistance to ISIS."
imaginarymaps,2lt2pi,releasethedogs,1 point,Mon Nov 10 08:08:07 2014 UTC,When ISIS came there was no resistance once the Shiite soldiers fled.   not true. the battle for Mosul lasted for days.

Such a referendum would be as free as regular elections in Kazakhstan. The Kazakhs might grumble for a while, but given that they were the last nation to go from the USSR it seems likely they'd accept its rebirth.  So there'd probably be no violence, no opposition and no external powers within reach. Also as I said they're already completely within Russian influence, customs-union and Euroasian union.

On the other hand the anti-independence vote has held strong at over 50% pretty much constantly, so a large swing is unlikely unless the UK does something ridiculous (which is possible, but unlikely).

There was a free vote and the choice was made. Independence referendums are historic events and not supposed to be repeated after every general election.

imaginarymaps,2ko4s0,childsouldier,2,Thu Oct 30 11:44:57 2014 UTC,"my points:  Bosnia: I don't really get the fact that Herzegovina would become independent from Bosnia.  Herzegovina is a historical region that somewhat managed to find a way in the official name of Bosnia but doesn't have cohesiono or nothing, it's splitted between the Serbian Entity and the Croat-Bosniak entity.  IF bosnia is going to split the most plausible situation is Republika Srpska joining Serbia while Bosnia remain what is now the Croat-Bosniak Entity.  But I hardly believe that Bosnia will disgregate. dividing Bosnia mean accept that the Ethnic Cleasing of the 90s worked well and is a dangerous precedent, noone in Europe will agree on that.  second point, Venetia.  first issue is the border that's basically Friuli+the city of Venice while the most inhabited and vocal over autonomy part of the region is the Vicenza-Treviso-Padova triangle.  Second issue, independentism. venetian independentist parties have low percentages. while a greater part of the population is in favor of more autonomy from Rome this could be said for every single part of Italy. seriously, there's not a part of Italy that does not ask more autonomy from Rome and that can't use local identity to claim some sort of independentist stance.  granting Venice independence (highly not plausible) or granting them autonomy (Special Status like Trentino or Friuli) would generate a mess because every other region ofItaly would ask for the same thing.  the most plausible future situation for Italy if autonomist parties would succeed (and I'm totally in favor of this) is a federalization.  third Issue: what did poor mongolia wnt for to deserve an annexation to china?  other parts are quite acceptable (though I don't think Russia will ever get that much of ukraine)"

The separatist controlled area is not even close to that large and much of that land is in eastern Ukraine where Russia cant even pretend sympathetic groups. Next door is even more problematic with annexed Moldavia which is part of the EU and really would trigger a war with NATO, and even 30 years down the line would still end up with Russia loosing badly.  Same goes for an annexation of Georgian land now that it has an association agreement with the EU. And how did Russia annex all of the Stans without anyone noticing? Including the one that houses one of the LARGEST US BASES IN THE WORLD. Russia really is not the powerhouse that it is made out to be, it's economy is only as large as France's and it's largest export is oil which, while making it powerful in the market, also makes it dependent on a friendly market. this map has other problems such as in parts of Africa but all in all not a bad job and Russia, China and North Korea did not get together to form the COMMUNIST EMPIRE so 7/10."

imaginarymaps,2jykn4,Cyrius,5,Wed Oct 22 12:22:30 2014 UTC,"My biggest concerns are with the cross-hatching thing you have going on in the Midwest and South.  In any bullet-train system, the goal is always to connect the largest cities first, and then connect the smaller ones as possible. Realistically, Chicago (3rd in the US for GDP) should be direct-connecting either to Dallas-Houston (6th and 4th) or at least Atlanta (10th), since both are larger and more prominent cities than New Orleans (41st).  For the south, then, I'd extend the grey line from Florida through Atlanta on to Nashville and St. Louis directly, allowing the black line from Chicago to go St. Louis, Memphis, Little Rock, Dallas, Houston. The blue line from LA could remain going directly through Birmingham to Atlanta. The red line could then meet the black one in Dallas and then move on to Austin and San Antonio directly. (For a direct connection between San Antonio and Houston, the teal route could go San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, Pensacola, Atlanta.)  In the Midwest, there's no way in heaven or hell that a route from Des Moines will go to Indianapolis skipping Chicago, nor will a route from Chicago to St. Louis go by way of Indianapolis. Moreover, I think it'd be reasonable to build in a few crossovers, to allow people to travel more easily between parallel tracks, without having to clog up Chicago. A simple way to do this would be to have the cyan line go Omaha, Des Moines, Chicago, Indianapolis, then dip south to take Cincinnati, Charleston, D.C. The olive line from San Fransisco could then go north at Cincinnati to go Columbus, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. An extra route from Columbus to Cleveland then Buffalo could help improve interconnectivity on the northern route, alleviating passenger pressure so that Torontonians aren't forced through New York to get to Chicago or LA.  My last thing is that, in the interests of full disclosure, your inclusion of Green Bay on this map is quite optimistic. I like it, because to be frank, I think Green Bay needs a rail line going into the town, in order to encourage the kind of revitalizing investment that would make the city (and by extension, the rest of my state) shine. But as of right now, most rail proposals go Milwaukee, Madison, Minneapolis, with occasional consideration for Wisconsin Dells and / or Eau Claire in between, and for good reason: Green Bay's most important asset, ridership-wise, is football season, not large numbers of prospective business passengers."
imaginarymaps,2jykn4,BmoreThor,3,Mon Nov 3 05:50:36 2014 UTC,"A key bit of info you are missing, work has already begun on a high-speed rail link between Chicago and St. Louis. The majority of track work is already completed, so this is a line that should be included. Also, Chicago is one of, if the biggest, rail-freight hubs in this country, so any highspeed network would most likely utilize Chicago as a hub for the northern U.S."
imaginarymaps,2jykn4,UshankaDalek,2,Wed Oct 22 14:48:52 2014 UTC,Rail freight would be a detriment to HSR. It's one more thing to work around.  Chicago would be a hub because it's one of the largest cities in the country and a natural destination for people coming from many different directions.

If you were going to make an Australian megapolis by merging nearby population centers into one giant conurbation, then hands down the best place would be SEQ (South East Queensland). Take Brisbane, Logan, Ipswich, The Sunshine Coast, and the Gold Coast, build them up, connect them, call it the BLISS Coast and emphasise the touristy elements to make it into a debauched beachy vegas/miami style party city. Alternately, include Toowoomba and call it BLISTA City (Brisbane, Logan, Ipswich, Sunshine coast, Toowoomba Autonomous city). Or just the BIG Coast (Brisbane, Ipswich, Gold Coast - the largest three in the region).  Gah, Sydney-Melbourne conurbation is dumb; someone just googled the two biggest cities in Australia and lumped them together.

I've read Game of Thrones and watched the series, adored it and it is pretty much the 'base' of my map, is it that obvious? However, I didn't base my map on Westeros, I based it primarily on three things: the first being Europe (hence the 'mediterrean(sp?) sea', reverse strait of gibraltar, and an emphasis on bays and seas surrounded by land). The second is my 'version' of what a fantasy empire would actually look like, I'll elaborate on that tomorrow.   The third is that I tried to create the territory or land of a princedom in a rough shape of their ruling houses 'respective' animal: if you look at the eastern princedoms (and Silverwater, which I forgot to label: it's the light-blue colored princedom under Rock & Vale) this is quite obvious. Potitinia Inferior's largest island is based on a bird (House Merel, the ruling house, has a pheasant as their iconic animal), whilst the entire group of islands is based on a 'flock' of birds. Desert & Teeth is based on a shark (House Yelan whom ruled before the start of my story had a shark as patron animal), but can also be interpretated as a Jackal (House Sandstone's animal). Longlands have a Boar without it's horns (as it's part of the Rainlands), Rainlands has a bit of a Snake idea behind it's main shape and Silverwater is a school of fish (Dolphin). However I eventually had to give up as there was no way I could make something even remotely like a stag for the Lush.."

Also, the things that mainly remind me of GoT are...   The wall (mountains) separating the civilized people from the primitive clans. - The Wall The Twin Cities - The Free Cities The Princedom of Rock and Vale - The Vale, which is known for being surrounded by tall mountains (rocks)   I was guilty of the same thing, accidentally making mottos which sound very similar to some houses, and naming places very close. And to the other question, I would guess the Crownlands, based on it's name and it's location. But power wise, I think the Longlands look the strongest.

And any American president who allows the largest state in the Union to be sold for any sum of money is committing political suicide.  His party will lose the next 5 or 6 elections, give or take.  Also, why would China want Alaska?  It's cold, it's all full of English-speakers, and China has never historically been expansion-minded.  They could get a better deal by just cutting a deal to forgive some US debt in exchange for rock-bottom oil prices.  This is, of course, assuming people still use oil by the time this happens, since an insolvency crisis in a country the size of the US would take nearly a century of severe overspending to accomplish."

With the advent of AI, a lot of things will change as well; things far more surprising that the Alaska Deal.   As for why Alaska: rich in oil and it showcases Chinese power: legal expansion.

I made a custom world for minecraft, but because we want everyone to feel lost, yet make exploring rewarding, we didn't want to hand people an accurate overview of the world like many servers do.  On the other hand, not giving them anything would make it nearly impossible for groups to meet up until players have made their own maps.  We went for the middle road: give them a map that doesn't cover the whole world, and with inaccurate proportions.

But like you said it's just the lands and waters exchanged with each other.  Then there's Inversia (and its variants) found on the World Dream Bank.  Inversia:  Topography inverted, mountains become trenches, trenches become mountains.  (incomplete according to author).  Abyssia:  A variant of Inversia with a lot more water added... until only 12% of the surface is land.  Siphonia:  Not inverted, but Earth with much of the water sucked dry.

Without saying too much (because I'm still at stage where I'm drawing stuff on paper), the overall idea is somewhat similar to East India Company with ship combat in 2D.   The difference is, that I don't want the backstory to be bound in real history so that I can broaden the narrative scope a bit (think Diesel-Punk privateers for example).  At the same time I want some basic world rules to be instantly recognizable. For example that there is one large politically diverse continent (like Eurasia), that there are poles, that there was glaciation which influenced the land, that there are areas which are more fertile because of river deltas or because they lie towards the weatherside of a mountain range (like India) etc."

And so far, this is the most realistic one I've created to date. However I haven't really worldbuilded much.. for me it's been really satisfying just building this up. I don't have many ideas for this world and it's inhabitants as yet. It doesn't even have a name yet.  I just came up with the below on the fly. Dunno if its scientifically accurate, but it was fun to write!   This world is the 2nd planet of Beta Virginis, a yellow star in the Virgo constellation, about 35ly from Earth. It was the eigth extrasolar planet to be formally settled by humans, with the first landings coming in the year 2366. The transcorporation funding came mainly from the Pan Arabia Alliance, so the first settlers were of Maghrebi and Middle Eastern origin. Architecture and culture derived primararily from the Universal Islam school of thought in the first few decades, though Levanty, and then Western colonists brought true multiculturalism to the world.   As it stands, this planet has a steady population of 15 million, spread out primarily between three major cities and numbers towns that straddle the equitoral seas.   The geography of this world is striking, with a harsh dichotomy between the mountainous equator band, and the vast level plains of the northern and southern poles. Due to the axial tilt, both poles consist of a permanent layer of nearly level dirty frozen carbon dioxide.   The seas contain the primary native life on this world. Hugging the coastlins trillions of polyps are bound together, creating a viscous, almost springy fluid bundled with many organic compounds.   So, I'd love some comments and critique!"

EDIT: Just had a look at it, and the countries mentioned are as follows:   Brytain and the Isles Hungarian Empire German Electorates The Ottoman Empire Mesopotamia Babylonia Catalonia Castile Portugal Basque Republic The Saharan Kingdoms Empire of Benin Electorate of Zimbabwe Kingdom of the Clove Islands Egypt  The Coptic Kingdoms New Denmark New France Mejico Denmark and Shleswig-Holstein Sardinia Naples Sicily The Venetian Republic Romania Transylvania The Magyar Republic Muscovy Tartary Cathay Manchuria Corea Nippon Pashalik of Kazakhstan Austral Empire Siberia Nova Zembla Svalbard Groenland High Brasil Empire of Peru Patagonia Van Tieren's Land"
imaginarymaps,2hcqe9,GeminiK,2,Wed Sep 24 22:27:48 2014 UTC,But Magyar and Hungary are the same thing. How can there be a Magyar Republic and a Hungarian Empire?
imaginarymaps,2hcqe9,Republiken,1 point,Tue Sep 30 06:50:03 2014 UTC,Good question. Maybe the Magyar Republic is a breakaway state?
imaginarymaps,2hcqe9,Enlicx,3,Tue Sep 30 07:19:13 2014 UTC,"Many of them are mentioned in passing, but no more than that, throughout the trilogy."
imaginarymaps,2hb7h2,kupfernikel,2,Wed Sep 24 07:40:51 2014 UTC,I'm now realizing how much this looks like a map of South/Southeastern Asia.
imaginarymaps,2hb7h2,Gondabuggan,2,Wed Sep 24 10:35:04 2014 UTC,I hope that the creator's first name is Van. Because this map could be called Van's Vilderaan.

imaginarymaps,2h6glo,djreoofficial,2,Tue Sep 23 03:46:13 2014 UTC,Op is an n'wah
imaginarymaps,2h6glo,den_bub,2,Tue Sep 23 05:42:57 2014 UTC,In my defense I just got done playing Morrowind at work. Life is good.

imaginarymaps,2h4c91,Airith,1 point,Mon Sep 22 19:27:26 2014 UTC,Have some colored versions over at the cartographer's guild. I guess I could always share those too.  Any thoughts on any of the stories?

imaginarymaps,2h27ac,voggers,6,Sun Sep 21 20:04:36 2014 UTC,"Shouldn't it be using a St Georges flag, given that it is only the nation of England shown within the UK?"
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,good_cunt,6,Mon Sep 22 03:22:06 2014 UTC,"I don't like some of the names.   I realise you are going for an archaic feeling, but to be honest it is more likely that they would use the modern names like Midlands, South West, South East, London and East (Anglia).  Also I think the usage of the Union Jack seems unusual, given that this focuses specifically on England."
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,BananaBork,3,Sun Sep 21 23:48:05 2014 UTC,"The names OP used are a lot cooler-sounding, though."
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,Hominid77777,0,Tue Sep 23 03:19:23 2014 UTC,The jack is just to fill a gap. I dunno but always seem to ascociate the English flag with football hooligans rather than england itself.
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,kilowhisky,7,Mon Sep 22 07:01:39 2014 UTC,"To add, since I forgot, state capitals.   East Anglia- Norwich  Greater London- London  Kent-Sussex- Brighton  Mercia-Birmingham  Rheged-Manchester  Wessex-Bristol  York-Leeds"
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,One_Man_Crew,3,Sun Sep 21 20:24:03 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't York be the state capital of York? I know Leeds is the more populated place, but York is the traditional centre of Yorkshire"
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,modernbenoni,1 point,Mon Sep 22 10:31:36 2014 UTC,"I thought that originally. But york is tiny; smaller than oxford, where I live."
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,vereonix,5,Mon Sep 22 10:47:34 2014 UTC,There's an argument to be made that keeping the Administrative and Financial capitals separate would prevent the black hole effect that's currently plaguing this country with London
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,One_Man_Crew,2,Mon Sep 22 10:49:59 2014 UTC,Neat map. You can add them to the image by editing the image on imgur
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,rattleshirt,1 point,Sun Sep 21 22:57:03 2014 UTC,"I'm not a big fan on my city, but couldn't Peterborough give Norwich a run for its money as Capital of East Anglia, bigger area, much bigger population, but Norwich does have a castle as well as cathedral."
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,the_Icelander,5,Mon Sep 22 10:51:57 2014 UTC,York would be better named as Yorkshire
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,vereonix,4,Sun Sep 21 23:27:58 2014 UTC,Wouldn't Northumbria be a better choice of name over Rheged?
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,TsarDionysus,3,Mon Sep 22 19:39:45 2014 UTC,"great map, kent-sussex needs kommas though"
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,TsarDionysus,1 point,Sun Sep 21 20:10:49 2014 UTC,Oops. I'll sort it later.
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,S-BRO,2,Sun Sep 21 20:14:59 2014 UTC,"I've always disliked the name ""East-Anglia"", as theres no west, north or south Anglia, it has always felt out of place to me. Love Mercia though, every map to do with splitting England up has it :P"
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,TsarDionysus,3,Mon Sep 22 10:53:52 2014 UTC,East Anglia is named so because there (I believe) were some other West Anglian kingdoms at the time.
imaginarymaps,2h27ac,TsarDionysus,2,Mon Sep 22 11:01:16 2014 UTC,There was never a kingdom called 'West Anglia' but there were the Anglian kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria.

imaginarymaps,2gwx7r,Oshawott3,3,Sat Sep 20 01:19:16 2014 UTC,What is the POD in this timeline?
imaginarymaps,2gwx7r,mcmacjibberjab,2,Sat Sep 20 19:02:19 2014 UTC,"I don't know. I'm not great with European history, and I prefer to base these kinds of maps on an effect instead of a cause.  I decided here to make the Jagiellon dynasty succeed in uniting the West Slavs, cripple the Holy Roman Empire, and then have England and France constantly refuse to bury the hatchet until England manages to tear France to pieces."
imaginarymaps,2gwx7r,KapiTod,1 point,Sat Sep 20 19:09:27 2014 UTC,"So essentially the Jagiellon's replace the Hapsburg's as Europe's big intervening dynasty?  Edit- Also colouring colonies the same as the parent country is the usual move, unless they have a greater degree of autonomy like the British Dominions did."
