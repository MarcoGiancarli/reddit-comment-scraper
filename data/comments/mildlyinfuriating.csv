Some people are just sticklers and claim that wording of lists is at best ambiguous and at worst misleading or incorrect if you don't use it.
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,GV18,5,Tue Jul 21 08:10:12 2015 UTC,"It certainly can be confusing if you don't use it, but I'd say 70% of the time it's not needed."

mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,GUSHandGO,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:06 2015 UTC,The AP Stylebook and even the University of Oxford Public Affairs Directorate‚Äôs Writing and Style Guide don't use the Oxford Comma because it's considered redundant in most cases.

mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,xcboi23,240,Tue Jul 21 04:56:33 2015 UTC,I think the point is the Oxford comma eliminates the ambiguity in meaning.
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,Kavis,46,Tue Jul 21 05:30:36 2015 UTC,"But, the ambiguity in that case was created by the failure to start a list properly.  You also don't use a comma to separate items in a list when there are only two items.    Edit: Aw, c'mon.  Don't downvote them.  Grammar and syntax are complicated, and if we're going to split hairs about it we should do so constructively."
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,xcboi23,58,Tue Jul 21 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that the example was not written ideally. I'm simply saying that if you are writing a list that is separated by commas, the Oxford comma at best eliminates some ambiguity, and at worst is one extra character in the sentence. Of course, I've always been one to use the Oxford comma, so I have that bias coming into this discussion."
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,jmickeyd,20,Tue Jul 21 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"There are cases where the Oxford comma, worst case, produces ambiguity though.

mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,stanfan114,3,Tue Jul 21 06:28:57 2015 UTC,"That is not a fault of the comma, that is just a poorly constructed sentence.  We invited Crystal--a stripper--and JFK. We invited a stripper, Crystal, and JFK. We invited Crystal (a stripper) and JFK."
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,farcedsed,9,Tue Jul 21 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"That would be solved by writing "".. Crystal, JFK and a stripper"".   No ambiguity on whether this is two or three people."

mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,jmickeyd,12,Tue Jul 21 13:46:12 2015 UTC,That was exactly my point.  Sensible word ordering makes more of a difference than the comma.
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,Kavis,7,Tue Jul 21 07:42:14 2015 UTC,"That's a perfectly fair stance to take.  I think the Oxford comma is necessary or not depending on tone, the audience and the needs of the specific sentence.

It was necessary because the author mangled that sentence to make it necessary, not because there was real need for it.  That's all I meant."

mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,TheChadmania,8,Tue Jul 21 07:04:25 2015 UTC,I feel like it's easier to just to add an extra comma especially since most people don't learn how to properly use colons and semi-colons but but they do learn how to properly use appositives.
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,blom95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:52 2015 UTC,"This is my approach, too. I taught my students to use the extra comma but didn't penalize them if they didn't. They responded better to clear grammar rules than to choices. My first rule on grammar: know the rules before breaking them. My first rule on semicolons: don't use them. Use periods instead. When my students tried using semicolons, they nearly always misused them. The one exception was using semicolons to separate items in a list when one of the items contained a comma. If my students knew by 8th grade how to place commas correctly in a sentence, particularly one with more than one clause, I had done my job."

And yet it is ambiguous enough that you think the perfectly acceptable stylistic choice can be cleared up by using a colon instead of a comma (even though using a colon would change the meaning).
mildlyinfuriating,3e0wcn,Kavis,3,Tue Jul 21 10:25:52 2015 UTC,"If using a colon would change the meaning, how ambiguous is that meaning? If you understand just fine that it isn't ""...strippers: Stalin and JFK,"" without the comma, why would the Oxford comma be necessary in that sentence?"

It doesn't reduce ambiguity and is widely ignored by educated speakers and writers. The only reason to bother with this distinction is to signify to people who put a lot of stake in essentially arbitrary and pointless usage etiquette that you too put stake in it.    According to this rule, ""less"" should be used only with a grammatically singular noun (including mass nouns) and only when they suggest ""a combination into a unit, a group, or an aggregation: less than $50 (a sum of money); less than three miles (a unit of distance)"".[1] However, descriptive grammarians (who describe language as actually used) point out that this rule does not correctly describe the most common usage of today or the past and in fact arose as an incorrect generalization of a personal preference expressed by a grammarian in 1770.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fewer_vs._less"

Her fees to help us book the entire trip, including 2 hotels, coordinating flights, travel cards, and tours was a massive $25.  It's totally worth it when you're dropping upwards of $10,000 on a vacation to make sure that everything is set, and good to go, as well as having someone you can call if the hotel or airline fucks up."

London is expensive as fuck.  It ended up being almost $1600 per person just for flights alone, sitting coach, our ""cheap"" hotel (a Holiday Inn Express) on the outskirts of London for the first 6 nights was almost $300 a night, then the Hotel we stayed in Central London was almost double that.  Couple in almost $300 for unlimited Tube/Rail travel for the entire two weeks we were there, another $85 for Heathrow Express Round-Trip tickets for the both of us, it all added up very quickly.  Add in food costs (2 Chicken Shawarma sandwiches, and a hummus starter, with tap water to drink cost us about $22USD).  Even going cheap and buying food/water from grocery stores was a lot more expensive than it would be to go out to eat here in the States.  EDIT:Forgot to mention that the 4 excursions we took (Salisbury, Bath, Stonehenge; London Bus Tour; Blenheim Palace and the Cotswalds; and the Harry Potter Studio Tour) averaged out to about $250 each for the both of us, then admission to the Tower of London, Wesminster Abbey, Kensington Palace and then the London Eye was about $40 each for both of us on average.  We could have done it cheaper, but with how expensive air travel is, we wanted to get as much in as we could to make the flights worth it."

mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,xblindguardianx,22,Mon Jul 20 15:26:04 2015 UTC,You can go. It just takes some saving/planning. Airline tickets are dependent upon where you're flying from. From the east coast they're around 1100.   Using airbnb instead of paying horribly inflated hotel rates you can get a place to stay in loading from 75-150 a night depending on how swanky you want to get and location.  Food isn't that costly; you can eat cheaply if you pick local non touristy places and do your homework.

The blinking Rennaisance can be had for half that. Spending time in cheaper parts of England. I think you could tick off all the main boxes for London in four or five days. Then the mainline train to Edinbugh stops at York, Durham and Newcastle within 3 hours of London. Even close to London you've got Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford... All nice places, cheap and day-trippable. Not to mention how cheap flights are from England to other places in Europe.   Saying you can't afford a holiday in London would be like an English person saying they can't afford a holiday in New York. Of course you'd never plan on spending a long time in New York, you'd bounce to other places nearby."

mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,Posanxoxo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:29:11 2015 UTC,Thats really fucking cheap. My dad went to New York in May and the ticket was ¬£430 on Virgin which is like $700.  Im almost certain that guys entire story is made up. Holiday Inn express for $600 a night? A similar hotel chain would be premier inn and they do double rooms for as cheap as ¬£30 a night around London. You can get a 4 or 5 star (cant remember the name but my cousin had a wedding there last year) hotel for ¬£150 a night on the Thames directly opposite parliament.  Train prices seem about right. Underground all zones is about 15 quid a day. Although itll probably be cheaper to get yourself an oyster card depending on where in London you are travelling.

I'm going from SFO to LHR and then returning from MUC and my full flight was $1200. Just took a little research on a couple online sites. The unlimited tube pass is pointless.   Grab a travelcard or Oyster pass and not only get discounts on multiple trips in a day with a daily cap on how much you are charged, but also 2 for 1 discounts on a lot of attractions with the Travelcard (Tower of London, London Eye, Madame Tussauds etc). Hotels can be a little trickier but just keeping your eyes and options open can help you find some good deals."

Far from the nearly $600 dollars Jimmy Three Shoes claims to have paid."

I've been to Chicago, LA, Orlando, Tampa, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Niagara Falls and St. Louis, but while there's history there, it's not the same.

Planning not only the 12 day trip through a travel agent, and all the reservations as well has been a smooth and almost fun experience. Travel agents are still a wonderfully useful resource."
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,Talk_with_a_lithp,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that my experience is the exact opposite of yours. Third-party search-and-buy services always end up cheaper than buying directly from the airline. I could've attributed this to the fact that I'm Russian and our ticketing system works in some other and strange way, but I've bought tickets for European airlines as well with the same result. The possible explanation is that aggregators don't just work on a cost-plus-fee basis. They purchase wholesale tickets from airlines and then price them any way they find viable, plus they actually get an agent reward from the airline for selling the ticket to you. But I might be wrong here."
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,Rolead,2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"I believe the location you're buying from is one of the factors that determine what surcharges you pay. So even if you buy a ticket from the KLM website or something, you'd still have to pay the same taxes and other charges that you would have with say, Aeroflot.  I could be wrong though."

Even though 3rd party doesn't provide cheaper price in most of time, we still need them to compare price/time etc. Google flight just beats all the other sites IMO. it doesn't provide in-state flights info outside US (and some other countries I guess?) though."
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,fireattack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"Last time I called a travel agent, they quoted me a price 25% more than expedia."
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,jabalabadooba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:18 2015 UTC,That's because the airline is making money off a product - the flights.  The travel websites are making money off the tickets.  There has to be a margin for profit in there somewhere.
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,elitexero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the idea is for them to guarantee a certain number of seats in exchange for getting them being to buy them at steep discounts, thus being able to sell at prices cheaper/close to what airlines sell them for. Them being considerably more expensive than the airlines makes it pointless to buy from them, unless you want to bundle it with other products and/or have multi-leg flights that involve more than one airline."

mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,AnoK760,4,Mon Jul 20 15:38:41 2015 UTC,google.com/flights is the best for me. It lets you find the cheapest place and most often it is the airline but sometimes it's not the airline you'll be flying with. I flew with KLM but my flight was cheaper through Delta.

When we got there there was no record so after spending hours trying to get a hold of expedia with no luck we had to rent a car but because it was a last minute rental the same car cost us $600 more than my booking. So I booked it assuming expedia was a big company that would fix their mistakes and reimburse me for the difference. I had my confirmation, the name of the manager of the car places info to back up my claim as well as other documents.

mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,grundo1561,58,Mon Jul 20 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Probably just a caching issue on Expedia's website. If the site did a full search of their systems everytime someone hit 'search' then it'd probably be doing thousands and thousands of searches per minute, making the system slow and unresponsive. Instead, they cache the results for a few minutes, maybe 5 or 10, and that makes everyone's searches much quicker. The issue that it then creates is when someone books the last seat at $200, the website still shows it as available on the next customers initial search, when it actually isn't."
mildlyinfuriating,3dx5x7,MywifenowDave,6,Mon Jul 20 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"Even if they didn't cache results, the searching process takes a few minutes, so there's always the possibility of someone booking it ahead of you. It's impossible to avoid this happening at least sometimes."

We immediately selected our seats and went through the entire reservation process only to see a notice like this right before we booked it that the prices had changed to over $900. We called Expedia customer service several times and were basically just told ""the airlines actually set the prices, it just means that all the ones at that price have been sold.""

mildlyinfuriating,3dxex0,Shorvok,3,Mon Jul 20 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"I'll post my reply to the 24 thread to hopefully give yall some context.  So I work in sign feature recognition and may be able to shed a little light on this.  Lots of cities have codes that prevent private organizations or individuals from putting up signs that match official ones. For example, if the city uses 25mph speed signs, you couldn't use one and on your private property that has a road like a large parking lot or a mine, you would use 24 1/2 or 24.5 or something like that because it's effectively the same thing without breaking the codes.  The other reason they do this is either A. they want people to be more mindful of the speed limit, and when someone goes ""oh that sign says 24 instead of 25"" it has that effect, though I can't really say if it's terribly effective. Or B. they put up signs like this because they're hard to follow, most people aren't used to doing 24 so they'll cruise at 25 or more and cops will use these areas as speed traps to write tickets."

The main road has a large primary and secondary school with essentially car parks for staff only. When there's no spaces on the hard shoulders near the schools, the parents would have razzed up and down this road looking for a place to park neglecting to think about other road users and pedestrians. Neighbours probably moaned about it.  Also bare in mind the main road is a school zone at 40km/h and this side street is 50/60km/h. So council built it as a traffic calming measure and forced the drivers to slow down and take 3 extra turns.  I was a lollipop man (school crossing supervisor) for the schools so seeing this particular picture was quite interesting to see!"

From Wikipedia: ""After the initial surveys, it was found that the borders did not always exactly follow the lines of meridian and parallel as had been intended. This is due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border. This issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and in 1925 the Supreme Court ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (this includes the Four Corners Monument)."""

mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,TheNerdWithNoName,7,Sun Jul 19 19:47:14 2015 UTC,Also so that you actually follow the speed limit instead of going 5-10 miles over. Parking lots at Disneyland have 14 mph signs I believe.
mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,magic_trex,6,Sun Jul 19 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"14 miles per hour is pretty bloody fast for a parking lot. Over here, most are 5 kilometres per hour, which is around walking pace."

mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,Purp,28,Sun Jul 19 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"It also makes people pay more attention.  Most people drive about 5 mph over the limit. So we get used to driving in multiples of 5. If the limit is 25, we'll go 30. But if it's 24, many people will feel uncomfortable going 30, and will drop down to the next level of comfort which is 25."
mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,Mayor_of_tittycity,59,Sun Jul 19 15:45:34 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. People tend to go the same speed regardless of the signs.

mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,theberg512,5,Sun Jul 19 19:13:57 2015 UTC,I make sure I'm going 7 over the speed limit so probaly affects some people but not most
mildlyinfuriating,3dtwb5,kcavo00,2,Sun Jul 19 22:48:45 2015 UTC,I wish people in my town would do this. In one place the speed drops from 75mph to 55. They just drive 70 the entire time. Any road off the interstates they just drive 40. Posted 55 on the outskirts? Better drive 40. Residential at 25? Better drive 40. Drives me fucking bonkers.

Of course that depends. If you're 10 over in a school zone then chances are greater versus 10 over on the highway.

If the driver did any of those things, it would be immediately obvious. The packages are scanned at every interval, and once on the package car, we can tell the exact gps location the driver then scans the package to take off the car to deliver.  If they fail to scan it and bring it back to the building, we know. If they try to sheet the package as no such street/no such number,  we know it's bullshit. If they miss service in any way, we know. The only possibility, which would be minute as it would result in immediate termination, is to scan the package as delivered and toss it, then say it must have been taken from your property by someone else.   We can tell when they buckle and unbuckle their seat belts, so unless a box misses a scan and is misplaced (these things do happen for various reasons), we know where it is, and any concern filed is taken seriously.

mildlyinfuriating,3dp7ff,JacZones,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:53:50 2015 UTC,"We have two theaters where I live. The one is $9.50 movie tickets or like $15 for 3D. There's a large popcorn and two large drinks combo for $14. I've seen those prices steadily climb in the last ten years.  The other theater is cheaper, but the seating is so less comfortable and it only shows older movies. I actually prefer being home over going to this theater.  I used to go see a movie every Friday. Sometimes twice in a weekend. Now I only go for movies that I'm very excited about and don't go at all otherwise. I used to love that place but the prices have driven me away entirely."

It's $12.50 a ticket here ($15 for 3D, $18 for IMAX), plus $8 for popcorn and I think $6.75 for a drink.  Even when I lived in the middle of nowhere a few years ago, it was $9 for a ticket ($11 for 3D) and $12 for a large popcorn and drink combo (except on Tuesdays, which was $5 for a ticket + free small popcorn). And when I went to a dollar theater 12 years ago, popcorn was over $3. I would love to be able to buy two movie tickets, a drink, and popcorn for less than $20."

Step 2 - pour contents into box whilst still at the counter area you completed step one at Step 3 - go into cinema and watch movie  Step 4 - eat M&M‚Äôs without crinkling the fucking plastic wrapper for the next 20-30 minutes of the movie and totally pissing off that guy near you. Step 5 - leave cinema having enjoyed the experience (and the others around you) without having been told to fuck off with crinkly M&M wrapper part way into movie. Step - 6 - ask wife for a handy J on the way home and get rejected for the umpteenth time.

So a box is preferred. However, cardboard boxes do not keep the candies as fresh as a bag, also, the rest of the candies are already being stored in bags at the factory (why package by two methods). Thus you put the bag into a box the consumer can pour their candy into and silently enjoy their treat."

I already found it slightly amusing that sweets came in boxes rather than bags....?! Surely that just increases the cost of shipping/storage space?!  Anyway, the guy handed them to me and on my way to my seat I thought 'that's odd, they don't sound like they're rolling around in the box....WOW there must be SO many tightly-packed Skittles inside this box that they literally can't move!! I love America!!'  Then I opened the box in the darkened movie theatre, went to cautiously tip two or three into my hand, and this massive bag slid out into my lap. It was like being attacked by surprise packing. For some reason I just found it hilarious, and the trailers had just finished so the theatre was silent, which for some reason made it even more funny.   Thanks for the laughs, 'Murica."

But THAT specific implementation of security questions is the dumbest shit there is in modern security.  Let's say you use a password like this: zdeU64m?]G$tn>Kv  You've got a pretty secure password that people aren't going to be able to crack (unless you use that exact one, cause now it's on the internet). Your account is safe as long as you don't share your information or download any programs that steal it.  Now, the moment you add password resets via security questions, your password is completely irrelevant. All they need to crack now is what your mum's name is, which is not a very difficult 'password' to crack, and they can change your password to whatever they want without ever having to even try finding it.  I absolutely hate security questions."

Nope, Rackspace requires human activation (by phone). And they ask you your security question, and mine wasn't actually an English phrase. The guy says that the support team asks you your security question when providing support on the phone. Which makes sense to prevent social engineering etc, but I can think of a better way.

Second the combination arrow/regular light that you described, you can go when the arrow is lit and must yield when the regular light is lit.  Third is the protected left turn signal as in OPs picture, all lights are arrows and you can only go when the green arrow is lit and (unless somebody is running the light) you don't have to yield because all conflicting directions are red.   Fourth is the flashing yellow left turn.  They're fairly new and still quite rare and work like this.  The flashing yellows are theoretically not much different to the combination protected/non-protected signals we see all over the place but they're a bit safer because the flashing yellow makes the driver think just a bit before they turn into oncoming traffic...   They also prevent a situation known as the yellow trap."

Unless this guy's camera has a fisheye lens on it, I'm unclear why the street widens here at all (other than for the island, which is possible). Seems stupid.

mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,TheHYPO,10,Fri Jul 17 14:27:30 2015 UTC,Speed bumps were put up in my neighborhood. It's changed nothing.  Normal and fast drivers keep their same habits but now you have the added uncertainty if they're just going to Dukes of Hazzard over the bumps or (worse yet) suddenly floor it after going slowly over the bumps.   If anything it's now less safe after throwing in that wildcard.
mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,studder,7,Thu Jul 16 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"And there are plenty of people that don't slow down for speed bumps. Your case is not the only case. My neighborhood has introduced tons of speed reducing measures. There are two sets of speed bumps, and islands like the one in the picture (but bigger) and islands on the outside edge of the street. The funny thing is the speed bumps are only effective when going at or below the speed limit. Most people slow way down for them and so they work. Some people though, have figured out that by speeding up just a tiny bit you hardly notice them. Over time more people have caught on to this, I'd say to just about half of people that drive through regularly. The thing is, the islands that reduce the lane size or that you have to turn slightly to get around actually DO work. So the long straight away part of the road with the speed bumps is just the same as always, but the curvy party with the islands makes people slow down and actually pay attention. There have been far less accidents and I feel like the kids in the neighborhood are far safer. The island in the picture is very small and basically pointless, but it's big enough that you actually have to pay attention to it. A small turn of the wheel is all it takes to remind people to pay attention in a neighborhood."
mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,bassinastor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:20 2015 UTC,"My street crosses a major road and then continues into a different neighborhood. On my side of the street there are no speed bumps or stop signs. My parents have lived on the street for about 40 years, and there has never been an accident. Meanwhile on the other side of the street there are stop signs at every intersection and speed bumps at every half way point. The only thing this has led to is the neighborhood having to charter its own police force to make sure people actually pay attention to the stop signs. It's always such a relief to pass over to my side after start-stop crawling through the other side."

mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,poopsoupwithcroup,16,Fri Jul 17 05:55:40 2015 UTC,"Tons of civil engineers on this thread I see.  Drivers have what's called ""shy distance."" That's how much (how little) room they're comfortable having on each side of their car before they slow down, and it's different for driver's side and passenger's side. Drivers from New York City area typically have a much smaller shy distance than from newer areas with wider streets, like metro Atlanta for example.  The traffic calming island works by creating a road width that is less than a person's two shy distances plus vehicle width. The person is just not comfortable driving past that slalom island at full speed. So, he or she slows down, sometimes a few miles per hour, sometimes more. For the area immediately near the traffic island this results in slower speeds, particularly by those who tend to drive the fastest.  Now, it's true that it's not the end-all-be-all. After all, in the areas before or after the island, the auto drives faster -- just like a speed bump, stop sign, or any other ""one location"" traffic calming device. And, of course, all you GTA 5 pro drivers can thread your ricecars through a needle so wouldn't bother slowing down. But, for most drivers, for most of the time, this device results in autos slowing down 3-5 mph or more.1 Motorcycles? Not a hair.  fn 1 This, of course, assumes that it was installed correctly -- that the resulting width is sufficiently narrow. If, even after installation, the width was in excess of 11 feet, it won't do much if anything, because that's wide enough for drivers to not be shy."

mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,SlyRatchet,16,Thu Jul 16 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Nah, I doubt it.   A huge amount of the roads in residential areas in the UK are too small to accommodate two way traffic (mostly due to all the parked cars on the curb), so you have to go everywhere constantly preparing for whatever could be around the all the hairpin bends. From what folks tell me, it's quite like some of the Eastern most US cities, like Boston in New England.   So drivers are typically quite slow and careful and mindful of all the road signs because that's just what you have to drive like most of the time (otherwise, you crash)."
mildlyinfuriating,3die0b,ProfWhite,8,Thu Jul 16 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you're partially right - the roads are very old and very narrow. Narrower than Boston actually - much narrower.

It's almost certainly not there because of complaints, but likely part of the neighborhood's plan.   So why have traffic calming at all, then?  Because a long, straight road basically allows drivers to CASUALLY approach unsafe speeds without really thinking about it. I'll use myself as an example; I live on a very long, straight residential street with no traffic calming. Tons of kids on the street (and I have three of my own). Just casually driving down the street, I'm always looking down to see I'm going 40-45 MPH... and I'll slow down. If I was outside mowing the lawn, and I saw someone going the same speed, I'd be pissed.   Civil engineers, in my experience, do everything in their power to avoid speed bumps and tables; there's lots of liability associated with them (look up number of associated deaths as a result of speed bumps vs. lives saved due to them). Traffic calming measures are just that; things put in place to TRY and slow the traffic flow. If you HAVE to go fast around that island, you still can. But it's designed to encourage the average driver not to."

Out of nowhere I see a tree growing in the middle of the road, in an island of very similar size to the one in the picture. I swerved right to avoid it, but there was a car parked on the side of the street, so I swerved left to avoid that . Ended up hitting a patch of ice and fishtailing into a different tree in someone's yard and ruining the back end of my jeep. Never ever understood why that tree was left in the middle of the road.

You can even shatter Pyrex glass, which is made to handle temperature changes, by pulling it out of the oven with a wet dish cloth.  As an experiment take a string soaked in a flammable fluid and wrap it tightly around the top of a bottle. Light it on fire. When the fire goes out or the string burns off put the bottle in cold water.  Glass is great at handling cold and heat just not both at once.  If you try the experiment do it outside and have the pot or but met tall enough to keep glass shards from shooting out and hurting you."

mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,TheHYPO,149,Thu Jul 16 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone is getting upset about this.  These headphones were not part of the Prime Day sales. Just because it's Prime-eligible doesn't mean that it's on sale or going to be a super good deal. Amazon inflates ""list price"" along with every other retailer in the world.  They are still the same price today.  http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Surround/dp/B003VANOFY"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,boxidea,37,Thu Jul 16 11:47:57 2015 UTC,This comment needs more attention.  Nowhere did Amazon say that EVERY Prime item was on sale for Prime Day.  Prices on Amazon just change frequently.
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,threeolives,0,Thu Jul 16 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"But it was widely circulated that this was the case. I spotted this rumour on /r/frugal and a few other subreddits. I think a lot of people went in thinking that.  The ""Prime Day"" deals = Lightning Deals. Most of the screengrabs floating around twitter/reddit today are of normal discounts.  Almost all of the $0.01 are Amazon responding to competitors prices so they appear cheaper. I notice is someone like BestBuy list something for $99.99 then Amazon will become $99.98 etc"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,tjuk,26,Thu Jul 16 14:12:49 2015 UTC,You'd have to be a monumental retard to believe amazon was going to put every single prime item on sale.
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Pmang6,0,Thu Jul 16 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe - but I don't think they thought through the ""user experience"" for new Prime members...  Imagine the path if you are new to Prime.   You spot a bit of chatter about the ""prime day"" discounts > Go on Amazon and signup for Prime > suddenly you have a new button with the prime logo on every product with a crap discount  It isn't that much of a stretch to assume that is you ""Prime Day"" deal and it is crap. When in fact the deals are tucked under lightning deals... and just a different type of crap"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,tjuk,7,Thu Jul 16 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I guess, but i have to imagine that most people are familiar enough with amazon already to make this a nonissue."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Pmang6,6,Thu Jul 16 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"That may be true but it's not Amazon's fault if people circulated false information.  With these things it's best not to assume.  If it's not expressly stated, it's probably not true.  That being said, I think they did a HORRIBLE job of surfacing the Prime Day deals for people.  I looked at that page said ""meh"" and didn't go back.  This was a great idea I think but the implementation was pretty bad IMO."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,threeolives,5,Thu Jul 16 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Also, he bought the headphones from ""TandHProducts"". The Prime headphones are sold by Logitech themselves."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,briansprojects,7,Thu Jul 16 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, THIS. I actually just bought those same headphones last week for that price. If I go to my orders, it shows that I paid the 89 bucks just like this image, but at the time they showed the MSRP and then the 'amazon' price.   There's no deception here, just a normal amazon item that wasn't part of the big sale."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,agreenway,-7,Thu Jul 16 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but isn't the point that they're being advertised in a way which implies they ARE on sale? Hence the price strike-through."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,DomUK89,16,Thu Jul 16 12:43:45 2015 UTC,They are on sale compared to the MSRP. Most retailers use the MSRP to give the customer that good deal feeling. It's incredibly average.
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Reductive,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. Although if they implemented that RRP on the sale day, then it's a marketing tool. However, what isn't clear from the screenshot, is whether the it displayed this initially. So I guess we can't say for sure."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,DomUK89,9,Thu Jul 16 12:58:39 2015 UTC,"They've been showing MSRP's and comparing their price to them forever. There's just no reason to believe the MSRP would change. You could probably verify it on the manufacturer's website.  Moreover, the whole original post really badly misinterpreted the sale. The item's not even part of the sale! This is like those people who go into stores and argue with the clerk about what Buy-One-Get-One-Free means, or move an item to the 70% off section and then complain when it's not 70% off."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Reductive,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"They've been showing MSRP's and comparing their price to them forever.   This is point I was discussing as I was unsure. In his purchased item list, it doesn't show the RRP - but it might have done when he bought it, in which case it's not a sneaky marketing tactic of suddenly adding the RRPs on sale day. If it IS the case that the RRP was there all along, then there is no problem.   Bear in mind the UK site (my homeland) displays prices differently due to different laws. Again, this is why I was unsure of how the price might be usuall displayed.   Just to give some extra clarity as I think my downvoters may have my point a little confused."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,DomUK89,3,Thu Jul 16 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"It's a valid question and I have enjoyed the conversation here. I don't know why people would downvote an honest, illuminating conversation. I guess it's just lizard brain tribal cheerleading? Oh well.  Was the Prime sale also available in the UK? I'm puzzled about all the international interest in what I thought was a US-only event..."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Reductive,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was available here, too. It was pretty underwhelming, although I didn't look for much other than a new monitor."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,DomUK89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Now I'm curious -- so the practice of stating a recommended price and calculating the ""savings"" based on that is not used in the UK? Or does Amazon still employ this practice there out of compliance with local regulation?"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,Reductive,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"It is, but it is more transparently listed.   This image is from non-prime day on my non-prime account:  You can see it states ""RRP"", rather than just a value - this removes ambiguity as to whether it's on sale or not.   Screenshot"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,DomUK89,89,Thu Jul 16 16:41:35 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like you didn't buy it from Amazon directly in the first pic?
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,VexingRaven,42,Thu Jul 16 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"I think that's what it looks like in certain browsers under the current orders tab. I may be wrong. Regardless, Amazon definitely fluffed up the initial prices to make their ""savings"" look greater."
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,PoppaDR3W,56,Thu Jul 16 02:54:02 2015 UTC,Do you guys not normally use Amazon? They always do that whether an item is on sale or not.
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,VexingRaven,22,Thu Jul 16 03:04:07 2015 UTC,I love Amazon. In my area i can get free one day shipping on a good amount of stuff. Its at more door in around 6 hours for free. Thats pretty hard to beat. This sale is just insulting though
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,VexingRaven,32,Thu Jul 16 03:20:59 2015 UTC,"That's not even a prime sale though, that's normal Amazon pricing. Prices fluctuate constantly on Amazon. I have no idea how they determine list price, but this is normal for Amazon.  EDIT: I did a bit of research, it seems this might actually be the seller's doing. If they're the ""main"" seller and Amazon has marked the product down from list price, the seller can raise the price and the selling price won't change. At least, that's what this post seems to imply"
mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,SirArchieCartwheeler,3,Thu Jul 16 03:36:02 2015 UTC,There is a decent google chrome extension which tracks prices of amazon items that you follow or add to a wishlist. It has camel in the name though I can't remember exactly what it is.

mildlyinfuriating,3dgh8y,SweeterThanYoohoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:22:31 2015 UTC,Make sure the drivers are up to date and youve used another USB port for the dongle (preferably not the one on the charging cable).   Mine basically wouldn't charge after nearly two years but in kindess to logitech the replacement was effortless. I just gave them the unique product ID and my address and I had a brand new one at my door a few days later.

mildlyinfuriating,3djn7p,lockwasher,5,Thu Jul 16 21:33:10 2015 UTC,I have almost all LEDs in my house. A fluorescent light bulb will die much quicker if you turn it on and then off within the first hour of it being on. It will also die much quicker if it is in a fully enclosed fixture. It will also die quicker if it is in a damp or moist environment that is not rated for. It will also die quicker if it is placed in extreme hot or cold environments like when there is snow out. These bulbs are generally not meant to be outside or inside of a bathroom where there is a shower. If you use a good LED light bulb you will never have to deal with these issues.

mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,billatq,5,Thu Jul 16 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"the items can be bought for like $15 in the 7/11.  Looking into it, people have been caught replacing items in minibar and those trays with items they bought for less than the cost of a beer.  Also, like I said, as soon as you move an item, it is charged to your card.  It stops people from bailing on the bill."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,oldhagfattypants,6,Thu Jul 16 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"Most hotels will waive all minibar charges at checkout if you dispute them. If that doesn't work, you can always threaten a chargeback and follow through if it doesn't get you anywhere."

mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,cb1037,122,Wed Jul 15 15:31:56 2015 UTC,They probably reverse the charge without hesitation if asked but are happy to snag a few people who don't notice or are too embarrassed to ask.

They usually tell you up front, and will remove it upon request during checkout."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,Eshajori,12,Wed Jul 15 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"Oh stewardess, I speak Jive!  That is fucking ludicrous.  Seriously.  I travel a lot for work (mainly Europe and Asia, so maybe that's that) and have never seen such a piece of amateurish bush-league b-team asshattery in a hotel (I've seen a lot of other things..)  If I ever ran into that and wasn't totally without alternative options, I'd walk out the door and change hotels.  I'm surprised a hotel would do this, given how much business you stand to lose from a shitty Tripadvisor/Booking/Expedia/whatever review from a user with a strong reviewing history - a lot of travelers will browser through the reviews section and look for the worst reviews first.  That's not to claim that hotel safes are really secure - they're a convenience and an impediment more than anything, and a lot of types are fairly vulnerable.  But it says a lot about the management of the place."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,EvrythingISayIsRight,5,Wed Jul 15 21:23:48 2015 UTC,I mess with the safe every time and I've never been charged... unless...  Fffffff
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,DontMentionLobsters,41,Wed Jul 15 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, nothing pisses me off more than when companies tack on hidden fees and other 'gotcha' charges.   If you want to send a message to them, file a chargeback on your credit card. This is the biggest 'Fuck You' message that you can send to a company. You probably won't stay there again anyway, and if you did you could just use another card/name instead."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,NobblyNobody,27,Wed Jul 15 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"This. There is nothing wrong with √† la carte pricing, but taking it too far is telling your ""valued customers"" that you're greedy and petty.  I don't want to give my business to greedy and petty people, and I will discourage others from doing so.  There is plenty of competition in most service sectors from people who make an effort to give you a good experience that you should never have to put up with it.  I once stayed in a ""budget"" hotel in London while attending a conference - it was awesome.  You could tell that they'd automated / standardized as much as possible to cut costs, but it was obvious that someone had genuinely given a shit and tried to make sure you got the most out of your stay (and as a result, would come back again).  The place has always been booked solid whenever I returned, and for good reason."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,DontMentionLobsters,7,Wed Jul 15 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"where was it? for future reference. I've yet to find a decent and reasonable hotel in London.    Well, the BnB above a chicken shop in Acton was cheap and ok but the room was only the width of a single bed plus a leg."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,adrianok75,7,Wed Jul 15 18:34:05 2015 UTC,"Had to look for a sec, it was the Premier Inn London Bank.  I think I paid about 90 pounds/night, which is great for a business hotel.  Super quiet, comfy beds (they give you a pillow menu with about 5 different kinds of pillows), ridiculously clean, brand shiny new, really friendly staff.)  Not cheap cheap, but then nothing in London is (the closest I ever came to that was a weird Pakistani B&B way out past Earl's Court that was half under construction and half filled with noisy students, the second closest I ever came was somewhere way the fuck out in North London across from a prison and without air conditioning, during a really hot July, and that's not cool if you have to walk 3 blocks in a suit to the next equally hot Tube station).  Fuck business trips to London when you're on a budget."
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,AgentMullWork,8,Wed Jul 15 20:32:59 2015 UTC,I don't understand how these places stay in business when they deliberately piss off their customers. I suppose it works as a business model in industries where most customers would only use your services once anyway.  Perhaps this kind of short-term profiteering is what happens when owners/shareholders want a quick return and appoint executives who will just chase the quick profits with no interest in the long-term sustainability of the business.
mildlyinfuriating,3ddbic,maikelg,41,Wed Jul 15 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"That is how I read the message.  Notice that the containers are all weirdly shaped, so if you have a moment of weakness you can't just go to the store and replace the stuff with regular priced candy later."

It was a $50 convenience fee for them to bring us an empty fridge plus a daily fee of like $5.

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,waterbuffalo750,246,Wed Jul 15 12:29:33 2015 UTC,They tipped $6 at Subway? That's nice of them
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,Rs7uN6g1X,106,Tue Jul 14 23:49:09 2015 UTC,I never even knew that they took tips. I guess i've never thought about tipping for fast food.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,beet111,45,Wed Jul 15 03:24:07 2015 UTC,They're probably not supposed to.

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,Gnarwhalrus,12,Wed Jul 15 09:30:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, if the person making the sandwich is fast as Fuck and does it with laser precision I'll usually throw a dollar in the tip bucket. Ya gotta appreciate true skill whatever it is"

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,swSephy,5,Wed Jul 15 07:03:56 2015 UTC,Some Jersey Mikes actually prompt you for a tip on the credit card machine. The franchise owner or manager gets to choose to enable or disable the option though so not all of them do it.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,Rs7uN6g1X,5,Wed Jul 15 04:13:16 2015 UTC,I actually avoid going to Jersey Mikes even though I like it more than subway because of this. The default is a 20% tip for an $8 sandwich that takes 1-2 mins to make. I feel douchy sliding down the tip to 15% and I don't even want to tip that much =/
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,ashesarise,5,Wed Jul 15 05:28:15 2015 UTC,You can't leave zero tip?

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,Notmyrealname,2,Wed Jul 15 12:11:02 2015 UTC,Figured as much. I'd be pretty annoyed tbh. If some nobody slips me a tip I can hide it easily enough if I'm so inclined. Can't do that if that person is followed by swarms of reporters.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,VexingRaven,5,Wed Jul 15 13:48:49 2015 UTC,"Every Subway I've been in has a tip container, still."

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,billyjohn,3,Wed Jul 15 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"At some places your allowed to tip, but the employees aren't allowed to put a tip jar out."
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,TDIfan241,45,Wed Jul 15 13:40:38 2015 UTC,It says their total was $44. They probably just gave the cashier a $50 bill and told them to keep the change.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,partyonmybloc,4,Wed Jul 15 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"We need to get to the bottom of this. Why did the reporter not interview the Subway employees, or at least get a copy of the security video?"

I'd be tipping people like a motherfucker. $10 lunch? Here's a 50 because you remembered to put a straw in my water and i hate when the ice hits my teeth. Nice meal out with the fianc√©? Have 100 because you are a pleasant person and smiled a lot. I think it would be so fuckin awesome to know that every time i went out to eat, that i could literally make somebodys week. Help make paying their rent or putting food on the table that much less stressful this month. even if it's just some kid who only has to worry about their wants, and not their needs, i still made that trip they're planning with their best friend that much more sooner, or buying their first car that much more attainable.

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,kyzfrintin,19,Wed Jul 15 04:11:46 2015 UTC,Dude that's a MegaMillion. That's 10242 Million.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,LochnessDigital,4,Wed Jul 15 04:58:42 2015 UTC,"The prefix for mebi is Mi though. M is for mega. Also your link is broken, but I navigated to that Wiki page manually. There's a table right at the top that shows that mega is the JEDEC standard for 10242 and mebi is the IEC standard for the same thing. So although you're not incorrect, mega makes more sense given how the previous user abbreviated it.  As for the original comment, MM comes from ""thousand thousand"" because M was used in accounting to denote 1000. This is confusing because in true Roman numerals MM means 2000. This is why we've switched over to 'k' to denote thousands of dollars. And we now see a lowercase m to indicate million.  It's all confusing.   In the end, my comment was purely a joke. Not to be taken seriously."

mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,kyzfrintin,3,Wed Jul 15 11:53:26 2015 UTC,Something I've only noticed in the last week. Million. Some accountancy thing.
mildlyinfuriating,3dazjy,Obnubilate,2,Wed Jul 15 12:11:23 2015 UTC,I thought million was accepted as a single lowercase m?

Ad block makes it harder for people just to run a server and keep the site up.   YouTube is free to use BECAUSE of the ads, otherwise you'd need to pay.   It's the same for reddit. You would need to pay if it wasn't for the ads.   I'm pretty sure a lot of people would stop using sites if they became pay to use. I know I wouldn't because I can't afford paying a large amount just to see YouTube, reddit, Facebook, Wikipedia, and so on.   Honestly, ads aren't that annoying. If I get one with sound, I just ignore it, it's not that bad."

I know a few that charge, and they don't have ads, but 90% of the time, a website that is free, is because of the ones who allow ads.   Also, the last time I ever saw an ad with sound was 3 months ago. Why are they so bad? I've never had an issue with ads."

Think for a minute you made a website, and want to keep it running. You would probably use ads to offset the price. But, if others used adblock, you would have to pay a lot out if pocket once the website got to a large user base."

I go to a lot of websites that refuse to use ads with sound. Some of them even have gone so far as to set up an easy way to let them know if one of their ad-partners snuck in an annoying noisy ad.   The philosophy of putting sound in ads is that in order to draw attention to your ad, you have to annoy your customers. I'm morally opposed to that philosophy.

If you steal a product, you cant whine about ""well I guess I'll take my business somewhere else"". You're a thief. No bushiness owner cares if thieves take their ""business"" somewhere else.  Adblock users are leeches on the web, and almost never are actual dev or content producers themselves. You don't understand what your precious white space and convenience is costing not just us, but you. Adblock created in app purchases. Adblock created popup ads. Adblock created the thousands of ""download now!"" buttons on download sites. These are all things we've had to do to stay alive in a climate where piracy rates are nearing 90% and adblock is not far behind. The more the steal and hurt devs, the more devs have to resort to tactics YOU dont like to cover for your costs and stay afloat.  You dont deserve other peoples hard earned content for free.

In fact, that is likely the reason behind victoria's firing.  http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/  Developers across the entire web are screaming about this, including Facebook and Google.

mildlyinfuriating,3d73ed,oompaloempia,10,Tue Jul 14 05:51:42 2015 UTC,"No, some movies do that and it sucks when it's subtitled into other languages. They then need to decide between putting the ""real"" subtitles in the same place as the English subtitles, with a really dark background to make sure the English subtitles are properly hidden, which is really ugly, or put the real subtitles above the English ones, which takes up an absurd amount of screen space, is also ugly due to the two different fonts, and is awkward to watch because people have the tendency to try to read both sets of subtitles if you know both languages."
mildlyinfuriating,3d73ed,KaliYugaz,2,Tue Jul 14 09:15:21 2015 UTC,"What's also especially infuriating is that Netflix subtitles never do more than one thing at a time.  Watching Knights of Sidonia subbed was a massive pain because many scenes take place inside the ship's bridge, where people are talking while they show you what is happening outside the ship on the giant screens at the same time. Both the conversations and the words on the screens are in Japanese, but Netflix will only translate the words on the screen, leaving entire chunks of important conversations completely untranslated."

Which is exactly as pointless as the Lilyhammer dub, where suddenly both English and Norwegian is German.  Though, to be honest, I wouldn't know which one of the two languages they should've dubbed. Also, not having clearly seperated original sound would be awkward, you wouldn't want to e.g. re-dub all the Norwegian in Norwegian because you need to dub the English.  In the end, I think, just bloody use subtitles. And this was arte who broadcast the butchered version, they generally aren't shy of subs, it's a most regular thing."
mildlyinfuriating,3d73ed,Peeet94,3,Tue Jul 14 11:52:26 2015 UTC,I'm against dubbing either way but the german Inglorious Basterds dub is really pointless as fuck. The multilinguality is a huge part of the movie.

It had these gems: ""(gravel crunching under foot)"" and ""(fire crackles)"" and from then on, I resolved to always watch with subtitles because their mundane-ness almost becomes part of the entertainment.  Mr. Robot (and to a lesser extent, Sense8) has distinguished itself by sometimes telling me what kind of music I am hearing. Sometimes it's ""[edgy music]"" but sometimes it's ""[tense music]"" and then there's ""[suspenseful music]."" It all sounds about the same to me, so I'm glad the subtitles are there to tell me what emotion I'm feeling. (BTW, this isn't really a slam against the show: I like it.  But the subtitles are a hilarious extra dimension.)"

People thought the ending didn't answer any questions even though they had been answering a lot of them in the last few seasons. A lot of people just expected the show to have another plot twist about each answer they've seen, so they quickly dismissed and forgot them, then complained that they didn't get answers at the end.   A lot of people also unrealistically wanted the ending to have been planned from the very beginning, and lampooned the showrunners for ""making things up as they went along"". Having it planned out for the last two to three seasons wasn't enough I guess.

mildlyinfuriating,3d73ed,wiccabilly,8,Tue Jul 14 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"This has come up many times before, so I'll just repeat the explanation I've given before:   In the early days of Netflix streaming, they were actually ripping the DVDs for streaming with over-the-counter ripping software. Which handled hardsubs flawlessly.  (Context: For those of you that don't know, modern subtitles are stored as plain text. The only exceptions are subtitle jokes where the placement of subtitles is key and so they are actually done with special effects onto the movie frames themselves. For everything else, the subtitle text is read by the player and then overlaid on top of the movie frames at the moment of playback. Hardsubs contain a flag that says ""always show this text regardless of the player's subtitle setting"" while softsubs will only be displayed if you choose a specific subtitle track.)  Then the movie studios complained that Netflix couldn't be using illegal techniques to get their steaming files, even if they were legally licensed. So the movie studios began supplying all the digital files that Netflix uses for streaming.  Except the movie studios are all run by complete fucking MORONS who do not deliver a proper DVD structure folder with those vital settings files that distinguish hardsubs from softsubs. Consequently, virtually ALL foreign-language dialog on Netflix is missing subtitles.  When you do turn on Subtitles, you get ""[Speaking in Russian]"" as the caption. Why? Because those softsubs were written with the understanding there would already be hardsubs displaying the translation.  Now true, some movies don't present hardsub translations when people speak in a foreign language. Usually because the actor on screen is going to say ""He says..."" and translate that way. But there are dozens of movies where important plot points are contained in foreign language dialog which Netflix airs completely blank or with completely useless ""[Speaking French]"" subtitles.  I have complained dozens of times to Netflix, and even after getting escalated to the top mucky-mucks the answer is always, ""yeah we know, yeah it sucks, but this is the shit the studios give us and we can't fix it, only report it and hope they do"".  Yet another stellar example of pirates getting the best and actual paying customers getting fucked instead."

There has been much discussion about possible languages on which the vampires' language may have been based. Because of what some describe as a ""guttural"" aspect to the vampires' speech, various languages in the Slavic, Germanic, Hungarian, and Scandinavian tongues have been suggested. Others have noticed clicks in the speech and have suggested Native American, African tribal, or Australian aboriginal languages. Because the vampires' language in the comic series was described as an ""ancient unknown"" language, some have suggested ancient Egyptian, Celtic, or Mayan. Even fictional languages such as Klingon, Wookie, or the raptors in Jurassic Park have been offered as possibilities. However, in a first screening Q&A interview, director David Slade admits that it is a purely fictional language designed by himself, Danny Huston (who plays Marlow, the lead vampire), and a New Zealand linguist. They did not base it on human speech at all but meant for it to be animalistic in nature, based on sounds made by animals while feeding, eating, and expressing hatred. Here is little dictionary of the vampire language subtitled as heard in the movie: Ga = God, Ip = they/them, Aht = believe, and Shakara = destroy."

mildlyinfuriating,3dajng,phillyphan96,3,Tue Jul 14 19:50:32 2015 UTC,Pearson in general sucks. I took microeconomics during spring quarter and we had to use MyEconLab for homework. Half of the time you'd put in the correct answer and it'd tell you that it was wrong. Or it'd want an answer that was totally different from what was in the textbook that it was supposedly based off of.  And we only used it because it was convenient for the professor since she didn't have to grade our homework.

I wish you best of luck, but you're likely to hear the same thing.   I don't even understand why we need a professor and mymathlab, isn't the program already the teacher?

I guess they don't realize that recycling can be quite difficult if you don't live in an area that offers pickup or drop off. I live in a city that provides bins to put recyclable material into now but a few counties over there isn't anywhere to recycle. The only trash pickup is provided by a private company as well.

Our city just instituted a curbside recycling program about a year or so ago, which is great because prior to that I was paying more for a recycling service and prior to THAT I was sorting everything out and driving across town to the Walmart Recycling Center.  That was a huge pain in the ass, but I got super into recycling when my kid was born because I was really into the idea of her growing up with recycling being the totally normal thing that we did."

At least with the curbside recycling I have a rolling cart that I can leave outside of my garage to collect it all; no sorting or anything! The only thing they don't take is plastic grocery bags so I still have to drive those out to Walmart.  It's such a chore and I hate it.  You'd think that would help remind me to use my reusable bags more often, but you'd be wrong. :)  Mom brain is a real disorder and it makes me forget even the most basic things."

mildlyinfuriating,3d3y21,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:18 2015 UTC,I actually think it is exactly that. The wiring transposition will reduce parallelism which can lead to crosstalk.
mildlyinfuriating,3d3y21,NecessaryMutilation,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"Transposition (telecommunications):       Transposition is the periodic swapping of positions of the conductors of a transmission line, in order to reduce crosstalk and otherwise improve transmission. In telecommunications this applies to balanced pairs whilst in power transmission lines three conductors are periodically transposed.  For cables, the swapping is gradual and continuous; that is the two or three conductors are twisted around each other. For communication cables this is called twisted pair. For overhead power lines or open pair communication lines, the conductors are exchanged at pylons, for example at transposition towers or at utility poles, respectively.  The mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposition. Transposition also equalizes their impedance relative to ground, thus avoiding one-sided loads in three-phase electric power systems. Transposing is an effective measure for the reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.

mildlyinfuriating,3d0t20,RadleyCoopSound,3,Sun Jul 12 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, you fucking psycho, maybe I can help.    While I actually like the taste of most energy drinks, I don't find them particularly refreshing.  The same applies to soda.  When I'm actually thirsty, I crave water.  Soda and energy drinks make my mouth feel gummy when I'm dehydrated, and that's the last thing I want.  In regards to energy boost, the higher volume is actually necessary for the amount of sucrose that's dissolved in those things (~40g).  While caffeine is great, sometimes I want the additional sugar-rush.  Coffee is my standard pick-me-up (1 tsp of sugar), but sometimes I just want that sugar+caffeine overload, or it's really hot outside and hot coffee doesn't sound appealing.  I'd drink more cold coffee, but I haven't found anything I like as abundant as energy drinks, and I don't think ahead enough to make my own cold-brew."

Nor do I find energy drinks to leave me feeling refreshed, but I drink a lot more of them. They both leave a nasty feeling in my mouth and I have to brush my teeth as soon as I finish one.  For energy drinks, its more about the process of drinking it. It takes longer to drink because they are bigger, obviously.

mildlyinfuriating,3d0o8w,VintageTupperware,27,Sun Jul 12 19:20:51 2015 UTC,This is why you tuck your bedsheetsunder the matress - the stretchy ring at the edge is supposed to be smaller so it can grip underneath to prevent this from happening.

The album's lead single, ""The Way"", became a top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, with critics comparing her wide vocal range to Mariah Carey. Her second studio album, My Everything (2014), also reached number one in the United States. It contained the hit singles ""Problem"" and ""Break Free"". With songs ""Break Free"", ""Problem"", ""Bang Bang"" and ""Love Me Harder"", she spent 34 continuous weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100  and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014.

mildlyinfuriating,3cyngo,dwntwnleroybrwn,10,Sun Jul 12 02:07:15 2015 UTC,You're missing the point. In Seattle and other cities the minimum wage has been (or talks are ongoing) increased to in excess of $10/hr. The reason we tip is because wait staff are NOT paid minimum wage and the tip offsets that discrepancy. There is no reason to tip someone if they are paid a full wage.   While the card is a bit cringe worthy I agree with it in principal. Same concept as when traveling over seas and tipping is not customary.
mildlyinfuriating,3cyngo,manicnymph,2,Sun Jul 12 03:39:58 2015 UTC,Washington has ALWAYS had full wage for servers.  This minimum wage increase shouldn't change anything.

It's because you can only use 3 chords in any pink song, so eventually run out of possible tracks. Also, punk songs are really short, further limiting it. And there are another few features that all punk songs must contain, such as primal screaming, fuzzy guitar, and a vomiting sound."

mildlyinfuriating,3ct55q,just_an_ordinary_guy,2,Sat Jul 11 06:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a water treatment operator.  Usually, my job is babysitting a plant where everything is steady state.  I do a couple hours of work which mostly involves running some lab tests to make sure the instrumentation is still working right, and calibrating the instrumentation if it isn't.  That leaves me with a bunch of extra time to do whatever.  Whenever we gets storms though, I have significantly less time for reddit since I am running a lot more tests to make sure treatment is correct.  The supervisors seem to be somewhat ok with this, because we definitely bust our asses when we need to.  However, some of them think we don't do enough work, and want to keep coming up with busy work.  They forget that all of that free time is available for when shit does hit the fan."
mildlyinfuriating,3ct55q,liskoturri,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:15:09 2015 UTC,Cool :D  Hey do people actually dive in the water treatment pool?
mildlyinfuriating,3ct55q,just_an_ordinary_guy,2,Sat Jul 11 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"A couple of ways.  Generally, it requires some sort of experience.  I know that there are some associate programs that specialize in water treatment.  You could also go the B.S. route and go for chemistry, environmental, etc.  But you'll be underemployed as an operator.  It could definitely lead to better advancement though.  As for myself, I was a nuclear propulsion mechanic and operator in the navy and applied to the water plant for an operator/maintenance position.  Lots of similar equipment.  Pumps, piping, water, etc.  i didn't have the chemical background, but I found it easy to pick up.  So an industrial process background would probably help too.  It's dependent on the hiring standards of the municipality or company, but those would be solid routes to employment in the industry."

mildlyinfuriating,3csws4,studder,94,Fri Jul 10 18:05:44 2015 UTC,Then you have to sorta grip the whole roll with your fingers and kind of turn it until you get that piece.

I'd want everyone to WANT to come to work and lose their families because they wont go home. That way I have all their time and no distractions.

Make the barista a paid administrative person, and then bring them into meetings to serve lattes, and keep them as managerial private council.   I worked in a coffee shop for 7 years.

Think of how much toilet paper is probably used in a day at your school. It has to be able to break down easily, or it's going to get caught in the line. Then you get sewage and shit coming up from your plumbing fixtures! So go ahead and make a fucking catcher's mitt with that nearly transparent paper, because that's still better for the sewer line than Northern Quilted."

It is all about that first psychological step. People who make the initial decision to buy something, will often follow through with it.  If they wanted it in a box for the simply purpose of the benefits a box offers, then they would place the candy directly in the box without the use of a bag, since the cost of he bag will add up."

mildlyinfuriating,3cuvxy,joeltrane,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"How is that not that same thing as what this post is about? In the post, he's comparing paying $3.49/lb for 1.91 lb with paying $4.39/lb for 4.21 lb. He is expecting the larger volume of product to have a lower price per lb.  What I said is that Santitas has two bag sizes, regular and grande. The regular bag costs $2 and weighs 1 lb, and the grande costs $3 and weighs 1.3 lb.   This means that the regular bag costs $2/lb and the larger bag costs $2.31/lb, which is counter-intuitive. The consumer should expect a discount for purchasing more of a given product."

But there's nothing that says more = cheaper and not all companies do it.  A 12oz soda can costs significantly more per oz than a 2L soda, but a 20oz soda costs even more per oz than a 12oz can.  There's other factors to it than just more = cheaper.  And to answer your first question:  trimmed meat costs more than untrimmed, you are not paying for the labor to trim the fat off the meat.  So, if they are both chicken breast, and say one of them is with rib meat and one is without, then it's reasonable to think they would cost different, while the food tag on it used roughly the same wording."

mildlyinfuriating,3cvjmm,dualitynyc,2,Sat Jul 11 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Pao's incompetence was definitely blown out of proportion by a lot of users. The Nazi comparisons, threats, etc were undeniably stupid, but it's kind of hard to argue that Reddit is full of misogynists when there was such an uproar over Victoria (supposedly) being fired.  Gawker is one of the shittiest, most bias ""news"" sites on the internet. They lap this shit up because it gets clicks. What's really infuriating is how many people buy into it. They're caught up in a pseudo-women's rights movement that does more harm than good.  Oh well."

mildlyinfuriating,3cvjmm,dualitynyc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"Oh ok.  I guess I could see that.  I haven't really followed the drama all that much.  I don't really care which billionaire controls reddit, as long as there's still content and discussions to keep bringing me back.  And I know people were mad about Chairman Pao's axing of those certain subs but they were pretty hateful and mean at the expense of people who don't deserve that kind of ridicule or abuse, even if it isn't direct and, as someone who suffers the physical and societal consequences of gender dysphoria, I can't say I was sad one bit to see /r/trans_fags go.  And FPH made me chuckle here and there but even still, those people didn't deserve to have their photos plastered all over a space meant to ridicule them.  Nobody deserves that, no matter how fat or whatever they happen to be.  Sure some people who happen to be overweight say some dumbass, asshole things on the internet and it can be fun to talk shit but is being able to talk shit really so important that it should also be at the expense of people (and sometimes even people who aren't all that ""fat!""  Gasp!) who are just trying to accept themselves and be confident in who they are?  And that whole Victoria thing sucks but shit happens and I don't know her and again, I'll be here as long as the content and discussions keep pulling me back."
mildlyinfuriating,3cvjmm,thezooman123,3,Sat Jul 11 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"It was never Ellen's fault that Victoria lost her job.  She wasn't a particularly amazing CEO, and it wasn't even her entirely that we have to thank for hateful subs being removed.  Its a good thing when sub's that attack people get removed. Bullying was never protected as free speech, and reddit doesn't have any obligation to give every user a completely free place to say anything g they want.

It's largely independent of final speed, and dependent on the time taken to reach the speed it's set to.

mildlyinfuriating,3cpp6e,KellyeTheGreat,7,Fri Jul 10 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"There is a likely reason for this, the low setting is considered the 'keep warm' function.   This is so you can click over from either high or medium over to 'keep warm'.   At least that seems the most likely explanation."
mildlyinfuriating,3cpp6e,Sasquatch99,4,Fri Jul 10 03:32:07 2015 UTC,With slow cookers they tend to be the same temperature. Except low will take a lot longer to reach that temp than high.

The street continues north and south.  A llama is watching you from a pen at the side of the road. A mailbox is attached to the front of the pen.  There's a notice here.  The llama blinks at you stupidly.  > look at llama  You see nothing unusual about the llama. Except, of course, that it's there. That is slightly unusual, admittedly. But apart from the fact that it's there, you see nothing unusual about it. Nothing at all. It's just a llama.  > look at mailbox  The closed mailbox is attached to the front of the pen.  > open mailbox  You open the mailbox.  > look in mailbox  Peering inside, you notice that the back of the mailbox opens directly into the llama's trough. Strangely enough, this doesn't strike you as remotely peculiar.  > look at trough  You see some mail in the trough.  The llama emits a hoarse bleat.  > get mail  The llama licks you.

However, in regards to other printed items, junk mail is printed on heavier paper than say newspapers. Invitations are printed on nice heavy paper, but are not mailed nearly as often as junk mail is.  Yes, junk mail is not junk to everyone, but to a majority of people, I would say it is; and I personally despise advertising and marketing, convincing people (including myself) to buy shit they do not need. Junk mail is not a necessity, whereas, you could argue that newspapers and invitations are...it is more important for people to be informed of current events and important family/friend celebrations/events, than it is for people to be reminded daily that there are businesses that provide services.  I'm not in favor of putting people out of work, but there are other jobs they could do; especially if manufacturers quite outsourcing jobs to other countries...but that's another argument all together.  Plus, I still receive quite a few items in the mail, that are not junk. So I'm not convinced that by eliminating junk mail, the postal service would go under and thousands of people would be out of a job."

As for your argument about veterans, the job market sucks for everyone. You're trying to appeal to sentiment more than making an objective argument in this case. Yes, most veterans deserve our respect, but they're not more important than anyone else living a life. Our flippant waste of resources and the passivity of most in changing our habits affect future generations, the survival of our species.   Asking if we should do away with every industry that creates waste is a loaded question. Every industry produces waste. I challenge you to name a single one that doesn't. The difference is other industries tend to produce things that are actually helpful, worthwhile, or, at the least, desirable. Junk mail is just that, junk.  *wording"

Currently, these two states are the only two in the union that diverge from the traditional winner-take-all method of electoral vote allocation.   http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/national-popular-vote/the-electoral-college/solutions-and-the-case-for-reform/maine-nebraska/"

mildlyinfuriating,3ck3xn,PopWhatMagnitude,48,Wed Jul 8 21:19:29 2015 UTC,My opinion is that he's saying the most extreme thing possible so that any other view looks relatively moderate by comparison. He's dragging that Overton Window thing toward him so everyone else looks sane.

mildlyinfuriating,3ck3xn,BerlinSpecimen,11,Thu Jul 9 09:23:51 2015 UTC,He won't win the primary at this rate though. So he'd have to use this turnaround just to be the republican candidate. Then momentum would be lost during the final election.

mildlyinfuriating,3ck3xn,TsiSpaz,3,Wed Jul 8 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"This harkens back to the 1990's and the Kyoto Protocol. The argument was, that if the U.S. had signed the Kyoto Protocol we would have agreed to cut our CO2 emissions while allowing developing (2nd world) nations like China, India, and Russia to cut theirs back less or not at all. IIRC, the Senate voted almost unanimously that certain requirements had to be met before ratification. To my knowledge they never were and we never became a part of it.   This would give them a boost in manufacturing. It would be cheaper to run factories without the regulations.   Even though we did not sign it, through trade agreements and high corporate taxes, many companies moved their manufacturing out of the U.S. to China and India anyway.   That's the gist of what he is saying. So all these people calling him stupid....the entire Senate in 1997 saw the flaws in a treaty where developing nations were pushing for us to reduce emissions while allowing them to not have to.   This is why so many people think anthropomorphic global warming is not happening but instead is being used politically to weaken the U.S."

mildlyinfuriating,3cp3tt,stereofailureohno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"Information in this age is too easily obtained to warrant putting a price on it. ""News providers"" are essentially just ""opinion providers"". From this perspective, paying for ""news"" is a silly concept. In order for them to actually make money in this field, they will have to reinvent their approach instead of just transferring their format from paper to code. They will need to offer something more than just their opinion on already easily obtainable information.  If I were them, I would probably focus on a paid service on organizing ""news"" rather than simply presenting it. Think connections to old cases and how it is relevant to newer ones. Think links to relevant laws and the people who are handling the situations. Maybe more, maybe less. The point is that selling opinions is not going to work and they need to innovate."
