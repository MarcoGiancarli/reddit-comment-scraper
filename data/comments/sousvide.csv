Not really sure why. Some people suggested a few hours, some suggested a day or two. I decided to try this on a whim, so I didn't feel like waiting more then a couple hours. Meat was juicy and firm, but not chewy. Sort of along the lines of a New York. I finished with a quick 30-second sear to both sides with some butter and garlic. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and nom."
sousvide,3e286x,tonyblitz,2,Tue Jul 21 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"It seems that duration of cook time affects mostly the texture of the meat. At 24+ hours the meat becomes ""mushy"", at least that's what my research has yielded."
sousvide,3e286x,ypeyret,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:30 2015 UTC,At 24+ hours it stops being in steak territory and comes out with the texture of a long cooked smoked brisket/corned beef ect... 24+ is great for cuts like OP's but you definitely do not want to be venturing into that territory with a piece of fillet or ribeye.
sousvide,3e286x,jemminger,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"From my reading, you should be trimming fat off when cooking sous vide as the temperature doesn't get high enough to render the fat.

sousvide,3e286x,RibsNGibs,4,Tue Jul 21 16:06:54 2015 UTC,Depends on the temperature.  I think 131F+ is supposed to be the melting point.

sousvide,3e286x,mistrlrk,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"With that thick of a piece of meat I would sear it for longer to get more crust and better fat rendering - it's thick enough that you're not going to end up with a big grey transition zone anyway.  Not too familiar with top round; usually with tough cuts that you'd usually cook for a long time to break down fat (brisket, short ribs) you'd cook for days, but a cut that's already tender and lean like top round you just need to get up to temp (and hold for pasteurization if that's important to you). 2.5 hrs for that size meat is... probably OK? But you probably need to make sure you give it enough time for the interior to get up to temp by looking up a chart (say, in Baldwin's book. I use the Sous Vide Dash app on my iphone."

sousvide,3e53g6,omgmare,3,Wed Jul 22 00:51:07 2015 UTC,You don't have to chill it before you slice it. You could cut it and then pack and chill the steaks. This is what I would suggest because then you need less chilling time due to the steaks being thinner.

The advantage sous vide has is that temperature can be precisely Controlled and evaporative drying eliminated. For a really thick steak, the advantage would be that, while conventional cooking would result in a doneness gradient throughout the meat, a sous vide/reverse seared steak would have a uniformly cooked interior with a good crust on the exterior."

sousvide,3e5q2i,tonyblitz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:52 2015 UTC,Think of how it applies without sous vide.    Take something like a thick shortrib (not the korean style) and make it like a steak. It's basically inedible. Same idea with something like tongue.    You don't NEED to SV to break down connective tissue but SV makes it easier because of exacting temperature controls. Before I got a circulator I used to do 24 hour prime ribs in an alto shaam.

sousvide,3e2uee,Feeltheblood,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:05 2015 UTC,What are your complaints about it? 54.5°C (130°F) does seem a bit on the low side for that cut though since it might not break down the connective tissue all that well. I usually do short ribs about about 143°F (61.7°C) for 72 hours and they are fall off the bone tender. I usually either just sear in a hot frying pan or on the grill and add BBQ sauce if I like.
sousvide,3e2uee,elangomatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:38 2015 UTC,Maybe that's the issue. We are eaters of rare to medium rare at most. The thought of doing meat at almost 62C for 72 hours make me think I'm going to end up with sawdust.       I'll give your approach a whirl. Thanks!
sousvide,3e2uee,elangomatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest I've never really gone as low as 54.5°C with short ribs at all. I think that beef short ribs are such a different kind of meat than steaks and such that you can't really think of it the same way. The first time I tried that cut out I went with the 144°F (sorry, remembered wrong earlier) recommendation from this Modernist Cuisine post and liked it so much I never wanted to try anything else.

A piece with more marbling at 140°F (60°C) for 72hrs was great, similar in texture to good bbq brisket, but juicier.    I also did both of those at 48hrs, but it was much better with the extra day."

Based on what I saw at 60 C, I think the meat will be close to ruined already at 6 hours, even if the temperature is turned down to 57 C. I don't see the taste or texture improving significantly over the raw meat, so an extended cook will probably not have any improvements over a quick heating."

sousvide,3e14cp,BaboonFury,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:46 2015 UTC,I have the VP215. When sealing liquids it can come back out of the bag. There are two ways to go about avoiding this. One is to use a bigger bag. The second is to shorten the vacuum time. What I do is when I'm sealing something with a lot of liquid I have my finger on the stop button and when the liquid gets too close to the sealing bar I press stop and it will prevent any liquid from escaping the bag.
sousvide,3e14cp,StraightoutaBrompton,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. Definitely going to bump up my bag size and hover over it now when it's sealing.  What vacuum setting are you using when working with liquids? Does that even matter at all? Are there any disadvantages to the end product when shortening the vacuum cycle?
sousvide,3e14cp,cognizantant,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:44 2015 UTC,The other thing you can do is cool the liquids down. You are running up against the fact that the boil point temp for a liquid drops as pressure drops. It's the same reason that some recipes have high altitude alternative instructions. Cool your liquids down (put them in the fridge or freezer first) and you'll survive longer in the chamber vac. I think of it as a race between the liquid boiling over and the chamber creating the vacuum.
sousvide,3e14cp,frigginwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"You could just use a freezer ziplock with the submersion method. If there is liquid in the bag, it should be super effective."

They can seal whatever you want, with really high suction, and however much liquid you want.   Those are what you use to infuse things with flavor sometimes.   Too bad they cost a thousand bucks or whatever."
sousvide,3e15uc,the-incredible-ape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:43 2015 UTC,Too bad they cost a thousand bucks as low as $380 or whatever.     Fixed. I saw a refurb VP112 for $380 a while back. I would have bought one if I didn't already have one.  Even new the cheapest model is still only $520.
sousvide,3e15uc,death_hawk,0,Wed Jul 22 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what you are concerned with in the difference, but for long cooks of items with liquids, I use a ziplock with water displacement method, seal it, and then use the vacuum sealer on the ziplock bagged product.  Works for me"
sousvide,3e15uc,drays,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"In both cases, you're simply removing the air, not actually pressurizing the liquid.  The vacuum method is more effective, if done well.  Also realize that you don't need nearly as much marinade as you think, just thoroughly coating the meat is enough since the bag ensures contact.  Any that pools in the bag is not doing you any good.  My preferred method is to use gravity to force the air to the top of the vac bag, I will hang the filled bag off the edge of the counter, supporting it, so that the liquid settles to the bottom and the air rises to the top, then hit Vac-seal, what you see is the air sucked out then tiny rivulets of liquid will be drawn higher and higher as the air exits.  You want them to just reach the seal point before the vacuum finishes.  This makes for a good seal.  The other consideration is the heat seal, if liquid made it up to the crimp point, the heat seal might not ""take"" properly, try to make sure the top of the bag is dry, double heat seal if necessary.  If you're just marinating, Food Saver makes a marinating bowl that is quite effective that costs around $20 on Amazon.  I like to perforate the meat beforehand with a tenderizer or fork, creating mini channels that the air is sucked out of and the marinade is pushed into.  Try marinating first in this, then drip-dry your meat and seal."

Both were using the pre-marinated tri-tip from Trader Joe's.  They were both tasty, but the 2 hour cook was much tougher.  Personally, I would have preferred a texture that was in between the two in terms of toughness."

sousvide,3dym68,aurtunobandini,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly new to sous vide, but I'm guessing it's because there is some residual moisture in the meat, which heats up causing the bag to expand, which in turns causes some of the seasoning to loose direct contact with the meat.

sousvide,3dydv9,dts3301,5,Mon Jul 20 15:25:05 2015 UTC,I've been cooking professionally for about 7 years now. If i was going to buy another machine I'd save for a polyscience honestly. I've seen those things dropped and burnt out with no water a whole bunch of times and they still keep on going. sometimes they are on literally all day and all night for days on end.   I don't think that machines like the anova were really made with that sort of abuse in mind. the price seems to reflect the ruggedness in the units. I've never seen a polyscience unit break ever in a professional setting.
sousvide,3dydv9,iancambio,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:25 2015 UTC,I own two Polyscience machines which have thousands of hours on them. I've spilt water on the screens and use them every week 72 hours at a time. I looked into the Anova units and used one given to me to demo but I'd never switch. But seems like everyone in this sub uses Anova so was wondering why?
sousvide,3dydv9,iancambio,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:38 2015 UTC,the cost basically. less than $200 vs at least $500ish for the polyscience pro model
sousvide,3dydv9,Goonie_GooGoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"The Anovas often seen here are consumer grade devices - their warranty doesn't cover commercial usage.  Their $400 Pro version presumably is though, since it seems to be marketed for commercial use."

sousvide,3dvbuf,catinblack,5,Sun Jul 19 20:46:55 2015 UTC,People use ziplock bags.  Just seal it almost all the way and then submerge into a container of water until just the opened corner is out of the water and then finish the seal. Submerging will push all the air out  In fact sometimes this is a better method since it won't squeeze the meat so it's good for hamburgers for example.

I went with foodsaver, you can get a cheap machine for like $50.  Vacuum sealer is a good item to have in general if you freeze lots of food. Vacuum seal up extra meat and it'll last longer.

sousvide,3dsqqc,corvock,4,Sun Jul 19 02:29:15 2015 UTC,You will get a better sear from a cast iron skillet than a grill pan. I made the mistake of getting the grill pan at first too.

sousvide,3dsqqc,tonyblitz,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"The point he's making (I also made the mistake of once buying a grill pan too) is that the grill lines on those pans are purely just aesthetics. When you wanna sear something, the idea is you want to get as much browning as possible. The grill pans only properly brown where the meat touches the lines, whereas if you'd slap it on a real grill you'd also get browning from the flames making contact with the meat.  tl;dr go with a flat bottomed pan for searing meat. Save the grill pan for novelty indoor grilling like putting lines on toast or seared octopus."

sousvide,3dpcfz,GraphicNovelty,3,Sat Jul 18 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"133° F for 2 hours with fresh thyme sprigs and a little pepper. Saute mushrooms with butter, salt, and pepper, in a stainless steel pan. Set aside, but keep juices in the pan. When the steak is done, sear in the pan. Take the bag juices and throw it into the pan, deglaze with a little balsamic vinegar and water.  Reduce until it forms a nice sauce, then throw the mushrooms and sauce and you're golden. The mashed taters are a basic 'loaded baked potato' recipe with bacon, sour cream, and cheese.  Edit: New York strip all day baby"
sousvide,3dpcfz,DamienStark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, only thing I wonder is doesn't the steak itself get pretty cold by the time you've finished the pan sauce with mushrooms?  I rarely bother with pre-sear, but if you're looking to deglaze from the sear to make a sauce, might want to do that pre rather than post?"
sousvide,3dpcfz,Lotronex,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:11 2015 UTC,Warm your plates if your steaks are getting cold.  I usually just put them in the sous vide container after taking the food out.  Still plenty of heat left to warm them up.
sousvide,3dpcfz,DamienStark,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'm still experimenting.  The pan formed an okay sear, but it would've been better to sear on a clean pan before I sous vide it. For some reason I just don't like the idea of searing before heating it, I don't know why."
sousvide,3dpcfz,xaocon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"No I completely understand, I'm not a big fan of pre-sear, I feel the time in the bath mostly undoes the value of it for the meat itself, and pretty much everyone who pre-sears also recommends a post-sear.  But in this case it sounds like part of your reasoning for the sear was to produce some fond you could deglaze into a sauce.  In that case, the pre-sear would help with the sauce and not really hurt with the meat.  But as others have said, you could always return the seared meat somewhere warm like the sous vide container while you prep your sauce..."

I might try a lower temp at some point, but was a bit weary of such a low temp on my try.  I'm excited to begin playing chef with my new gadget."
sousvide,3do4rk,racerbob123,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"I do 143F for chicken, so far so good. It's more about the time than the temp.  Just don't let people see the chicken before you finalize it, on the grill or in a pan, to put a sear on it.  The little jelly like fat (i guess?) that clings to the chicken when it comes out of the bag can be a turn off."

Not sure if that is energy efficient when you can fill your container from the tap at 125F and start cooking in a few mins. Also a few less duty cycles on the circulator.

I always season my SV preps (salt+pepper+evoo); I think of it as a combination of brining and seasoning.  Others will disagree, stating it gives the meat a cured texture (hasn't happened to me; maybe because I aim for 1% or less by weight).  I'd also say that there's no point in salting and resting; the SV temps and time will give it plenty of time to osmose even into the very center of the meat.    There'd also be some concern that the store packaging and/or seal may not hold up to a water bath, but those gold-colored Wegman's packages seem plenty sturdy."

sousvide,3dk99j,XenoRyet,12,Thu Jul 16 23:10:49 2015 UTC,"Cast iron does a better job of retaining the high heat that you need for a quick sear. If you can't maintain the high heat, it takes longer to get a good sear and you overcook the steak."
sousvide,3dk99j,hammadurb,5,Thu Jul 16 23:26:31 2015 UTC,Just a precision. The average American (or Canadian) cast iron pan will perform better than the average Stainless steel pan. But an All-Clad 5d or the infamous Viking 9 layers will perform as well as cast iron.  The problem is after that after buying one of those stainless steel pan you can't afford steak anymore.
sousvide,3dk99j,jimtk,2,Fri Jul 17 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"So if I'm getting sears I'm happy with out of steel, iron isn't going to do much more for me?

sousvide,3dk99j,bigdaddybodiddly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, but on a burner, where lots of people use a cast iron skillet for searing, will have hot spots.  I'm not sure I understand your point here:   ""I've noticed hot spots in my cast iron""   and   ""Heats up very evenly in the oven""   The point is that cast iron has a relatively high ""heat capacity"" but isn't as transmissive of that heat energy as say copper or aluminum. This means you've got to give your cast iron pan time to heat up (on a burner), usually starting at a lower stove setting so the hotspots don't burn off the seasoning...and moving it around a few times will help too.  I expect your all-clad works just great for this, and also can shed heat quickly when you turn off the burner under it which makes it great for other things, but cast iron will have greater heat holding capacity than an aluminum/copper sandwiched pan of similar or less mass (weight)."

sousvide,3dk99j,AncientPC,4,Mon Jul 20 00:38:04 2015 UTC,Cast iron has higher heat capacity but hot spots as well.  I use some thick anodized aluminum pans for a sear.
sousvide,3dk99j,elangomatt,3,Fri Jul 17 06:25:26 2015 UTC,I think many people say cast iron because cast iron is good at building up a lot of heat in the pan so that the food can be seared as quickly as possible.

It produces a smoky flavour, but doesn't produce a carbon monoxide ""smoke ring"" in the meat, and I don't think it produces all of the tasty by-products of proper smoking.  There's also some debate about the temperature of the smoke it produces. I'm no BBQ expert, but from what I've read proper smoking technique involves heating the wood beyond the point where you see smoke - and the Smoking Gun doesn't do that.

Just a warning, though: From my experience (bag failure on a leg of lamb) what results is Not Good Eats (watery flavors, mushy and liver-like texture).  I think the abundance of water + SV temperatures allows the cathepsins (natural enzymes that break down muscle) to go into overdrive, which makes sense when you realize that peptide digestion requires one water molecule per amino acid (also why if you don't drink enough water you may get heartburn after a steak dinner )"

sousvide,3di9oo,lotsofboats,5,Thu Jul 16 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"you can cook without the bag, the temperature kills harmful bacteria whether under vacuum or not. However as the fat melts and the collagen breaks down, the meat will absorb water (and flavor) from the broth, as well as adding flavor to the broth. It makes it unrealistic to sear it later, because it will be kind of saturate with broth.  So if you want the additional richness of seared flavor, sear before puttting in the crockpot."
sousvide,3di9oo,AlabamaAviator,5,Thu Jul 16 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"Sous Vide literally means ""under vacuum"", so yes, a bag is necessary. Otherwise it's a poach or a braise."
sousvide,3di9oo,elangomatt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"To me one of the advantages of sous vide is that flavors don't get watered down at all while cooking. When making broth, you essentially want the flavor of the meat to get watered down so that the water tastes like the meat you're using. Since you're using a crock pot and an electronic temp controller you can definitely cook the meat directly in the soup but I wouldn't call it sous vide. There might be more temperature variation though in the liquid part since I imagine the soup might be more viscous than plain water."
sousvide,3di9oo,death_hawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"When you say ""water"" I'm assuming you mean a flavorful liquid and not actually water right?"
sousvide,3di9oo,Kaneshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"The reason it's usually done ""sous vide"" (under vacuum) is so that you're not running broth through a pricey immersion circulator.    It's easier to control the temp accurately when the volume of water is larger.  It's more stable.  That said, if you are controlling the temp accurately in the crock pot then by all means try a low-temp poach, and let us know how it comes out.  I'd say the danger is just that you're getting the worst of both worlds.  You won't really get any collagen breakdown like you would with a braise, and you'll potentially leech flavor out of the meat.  But I'm just guessing."

sousvide,3di9oo,axxidental,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:34 2015 UTC,"I have a vacuum sealer. I cook sous vide all the time. With Sous Vide, you are basically cooking the meat in it's own juices, in a bag. So my thought process is why can't I cook the meat just in 100% ""juice"" and let the crock pot itself ""act as the bag""."
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:50 2015 UTC,Because that's called braising.
sousvide,3di9oo,ijavelin,0,Thu Jul 16 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Not trying to split hairs but it isn't braising because with braising you fry the food in the pan ""dry"" then add liquid halfway up and simmer.   This is going into a temperature controlled flavored water bath exactly like sous vide but without the sous or the vide. I don't know what to call it exactly but I know that since there is no vacuum bag it doesn't meet the french definition of ""under vacuum"". But since it is going in a bath of 135 degrees F it won't be ""simmering"" as the water will 65 degrees below boiling, not just a few degrees.   However when I cook in a Food Saver vacuum sealed bag, the meat comes out in a bath of it's own juices and the vacuum isn't much tighter than I could get with a Ziploc bag. Thus I have begun to question the bags importance. I feel as though I could get the same to better flavor, sans the bag."

You may be gaining some flavors of the soup, but you'll be leaching flavor out of the meat into the broth.  This happens on a small scale with a bag of you add sauce or whatever, but on a much larger scale like you suggest, the effects will be much more noticeable.  More like bollito misto."
sousvide,3di9oo,LordeApple,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Bollito Misto - I have never heard of that but after reading it does indeed sound pretty much exactly like what I am doing. It also sounds much fancier than ""putting a hunk of meat in hot water""."
sousvide,3di9oo,BfuckinA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:11 2015 UTC,why not add some of the smoked onion soup to the bag and just cook it that way?
sousvide,3di9oo,Canadaismyhat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I that was my first thought, but I really want to know what will happen sans the bag."
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,2,Thu Jul 16 16:12:43 2015 UTC,Try it and report back. What's the worst that can happen?
sousvide,3di9oo,PhilosopherFLX,2,Thu Jul 16 18:03:23 2015 UTC,Depending on how long (and how intensely) he cooks the meat for and  in a worst case scenario it could be a pretty tasteless piece of meat sitting in a very flavorsome soup.
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,0,Thu Jul 16 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Well idk how your set up is, but I use a water circulator. If I had loose food running around in the water, it would get into the circulator and ruin it."
sousvide,3di9oo,PhilosopherFLX,-5,Fri Jul 17 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"You can get away with cooking at lower temperatures specifically because you're vacuum sealing, and not just plopping the meat straight into liquid. If you cook your food at sous vide temperatures without using sous vide technique you're probably going to poison yourself, even if it's just beef.   Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chime in and explain the mechanics of why the vacuum sealing step makes cooking at lower temps safe."
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,3,Thu Jul 16 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, wrong.  Safety here is all about time - temp curves and pasteurization."
sousvide,3di9oo,PhilosopherFLX,0,Thu Jul 16 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"and access to oxygen, and access to H20, and build up of CO2."
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:23 2015 UTC,Please elaborate...  Are you going towards a point about botulism or something?
sousvide,3di9oo,PhilosopherFLX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:38:28 2015 UTC,Just pointing out that another point of sous vide is cooking in a vacuum. Which allows cooking at much lower temps since living processes are literally starved to death even though you may be holding them in a temperature grow zone.
sousvide,3di9oo,Canadaismyhat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"I really think that's totally wrong .... There are plenty of anaerobic bacteria which thrive in an oxygen-starved environment (e.g., lactobaccili and c. botulinum).  What makes this process safe is exactly and only pasteurization.  If you can point to a source I'll gladly admit wrongness, but I have never heard of this claim that the vacuum makes it safe.  Google ""sous vide food safety"".  Nothing about the vacuum itself."
sousvide,3di9oo,strcrssd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"Well there are 6 citations for killing or controlling aerobic bacteria at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878450X11000035 if you scroll down to aerobic bacteria. So far in this sub, I have seen several recipes that don't go above 154 F, and thus can't be called pasteurisation. But, almost all of those include a cooking time that would exceed the available oxygen in the vac bag. I may be off but that's why I'm here learning."
sousvide,3di9oo,skahunter831,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree that vacuum prevents aerobic growth, if high enough vacuum.  And a vacuum will allow you to store the product in the bag for longer than usual at fridge temps. But this article explicitly states that pasteurization is a function of time and temp, does not reference 154F as any critical temp limit (I. E.,you can pasteurize will below that if you cook longer), and in the HACCP section explicitly states that vacuum is not an actual control for food safety. It really is only secondary. EDIT: clarity"

sousvide,3dku6p,SerLevArris,3,Fri Jul 17 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"I recommend chicken breast.  It highlights the difference between regular baking/cooking and sous vide best, imo.   Boneless, skinless, 140F for 90m-2hr seasoned to your preference."

sousvide,3dku6p,jasonlogsdon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:30 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your new purchase. Stick with the basics and you'll be fine, stuff like ribeye at 51C - 57C (depending on how you like your steak done) for 45 mins, chicken breast at 65C for an hour, fish at 50C-52C for 15 mins (depending on the thickness) and pork around 64C for 45 mins to an hour.  Once you get a feel for it, try doing 12 to 24 hour cooks with stuff like pork belly, confit duck legs, short ribs, etc."
sousvide,3dku6p,Joemoose13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help. There are so many different opinions on technique. I wont badger you with questions so I'll just ask one. Salt. Salt a steak before bagging it? After but before searing? After searing? A combination?
sousvide,3dku6p,Joemoose13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"Season before it goes into the bag, always. And don't be afraid to ask questions."
sousvide,3dku6p,Joemoose13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought... but then on a popular recent /r/food post people in the comments section were saying how SeriousEats said not to salt until after. And don't put butter in the bag. Anyway, thanks again for your help. Any other tips would be great. Regardless, you deserve some gold for trying to help me out."
sousvide,3dku6p,Joemoose13,2,Fri Jul 17 03:02:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As for the salt, if you plan on doing a quick cook and eating right away I don't see the issue with seasoning first. But if you were to season let's say a piece of fish, then you leave it in the fridge for a few days, it can start to cure it.  I personally don't put butter (and even oil) in with beef and pork, chicken is great with a splash of olive oil or butter and fish is great with olive oil as it almost poaches in it.  Look up Michael Voltaggio's (spelling?) sousvide chicken thighs on youtube, super delish!"
sousvide,3dku6p,BrokelynNYC,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:13 2015 UTC,Just tried those crispy chicken thighs. Fucking superb. Thanks a lot.

sousvide,3dku6p,Joemoose13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:15 2015 UTC,I read the same thing. The overall seems to be no butter. Only butter when cooking it/searing it. Salt is fine but not too much and not too long. Short cooks like an hour are okay. Long cooks and the salt adversely affects the texture.
sousvide,3dih2d,j--train,3,Thu Jul 16 15:17:39 2015 UTC,It doesn't exactly give the answer to your question but I thought that this PDF was an interesting read: http://www.safespectrum.com/pdfs/meatcolor.pdf  I suspect what's probably happening is that there is some amount of oxidation on the outside of the steak even though it looks fine when it goes into the vacuum bag. When cooking it that partially oxidized part of the meat changes to that unappealing gray color.
sousvide,3dih2d,elangomatt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:43 2015 UTC,Very interesting.  Thanks for posting.
sousvide,3dih2d,quixotic120,3,Thu Jul 16 17:56:06 2015 UTC,"This is basically it. Even though you vacuum deal there's still a considerable amount of 02 in the bag; a perfect vacuum is practically impossible and even an incredibly high vacuum is both unfeasible for a chef and unnecessary, possibly even detrimental"
sousvide,3dih2d,XenoRyet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"I wonder if that means you could get your all-pink steak by filling the back with nitrogen or something before vacuum sealing?  Displace the O2, so even with some gas left in the bag it wouldn't be O2."

sousvide,3deol8,stroginof,2,Wed Jul 15 18:53:16 2015 UTC,is this the best intro to sous-vide cooking? Am I better off spending a little more for a fully-devoted unit?
sousvide,3deol8,herpnderplurker,6,Wed Jul 15 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"what is a ""fully-devoted unit""? Anova is a GREAT way for home sous vide. Fuck introductions this baby is all you'll need for years (minus a vacuum sealer). If you want to save some money you can jerry rig a sous vide together with a 20 buck temperature controller a 5 dollar extension cable and any old crockpot, but it requires a little knowledge and effort about wiring and electronics."
sousvide,3deol8,GypsyBagelhands,2,Wed Jul 15 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I spent a year using my dorkfood temp controller (a way more expensive way to get into it, but I don't have electrical skills) on a crock pot and it worked fine, but when I finally bit the bullet and backed Anova on kickstarter, it was a whole new cooking experience.  Personally, I wouldn't bother messing with the crock pot setup.  It's clunky (lots of wires and shit) and you're limited to stuff that fits into the crock pot. I also wouldn't waste money on something like a sous vide supreme.  They're huge and offer no benefit over something as compact as a circulator."
sousvide,3deol8,herpnderplurker,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:18 2015 UTC,I should take a pic of my setup. It's ghetto AF. My crockpot gets a little hot and has melted some of the plastic off the temperature probe so its all taped up.
sousvide,3deol8,stroginof,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:10 2015 UTC,sorry for being an ignorant noob? I'd consider something like this to be a fully devoted unit http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA38Z10V9103&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-Slow+Cookers+%26+Egg+Cookers-_-9SIA38Z10V9103&gclid=CPy0orT03cYCFQEdaQodlEgISQ&gclsrc=aw.ds
sousvide,3deol8,elangomatt,3,Wed Jul 15 19:52:00 2015 UTC,Yeah you're typically better off buying a stick unit like this and using a container to hold the water. You have far more flexibility and movement of the water. The temperature precision is basically the same.
sousvide,3deol8,stroginof,3,Wed Jul 15 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"I consider the Anova Precision Cooker and any other immersion circulator style device like it to be a ""fully devoted unit"", they are just a different way of doing it. Sous Vide Supreme is a complete unit but all you need for an immersion circulation is a container to use with it. The Sous Vide Supreme devices take up a ton of space too"
sousvide,3deol8,GypsyBagelhands,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"Isnt there less of a temperature gradient with an insulated, closed box? Doesn't that temp variation affect the result?"
sousvide,3deol8,herpnderplurker,4,Wed Jul 15 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Since the circulator is actively moving water, all water stays at or very close to the desired temp.  The SV Supreme functions like a crock pot, so you're actually more likely to have a temp gradient with that."
sousvide,3deol8,stroginof,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"You don't want one of those. It's a glorified crock pot. It takes up a lot of counter top space and limits what you can cook sous vide. With a stick style your only limit is the size of the container you can find to hold the water. Chefstpes owns one and the only time I have ever seen them use it was for stock, not something that really benefits from sous vide."
sousvide,3deol8,herpnderplurker,-8,Wed Jul 15 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"no offense, but you're coming off more as an aggressive anova salesman than a helpful enthusiast right now"
sousvide,3deol8,stroginof,4,Wed Jul 15 20:18:53 2015 UTC,"How so? In my last post I didn't mention anova at all. I'm trying to discourage you from getting one of the box style water circulators. The reason is that they have a heating element in the bottom and have nothing to actually circulate the water, so the water is not a consistant temperature throughout the pot. Not to mention its expensive, nearly twice the price of any other ""home"" circulator. For 20 bucks less you can buy this. http://polyscienceculinary.com/collections/sous-vide-circulators/products/sous-vide-professional-creative-series That is the exact circulator I have used in several restaurants. It's up to you what you want to choose and which brand but I really recommend against that box."

sousvide,3deol8,constantino1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"Got myself one as well. Woot!! Can't wait to use it. I have been  drooling looking at all the pictures of everyone's sous vide steaks. They all look so good.  I thought I would share this with everyone. If you used an Amazon Visa card and made a purchase over $100, you would receive $20 off your purchase. So I used my card and I redeemed $1.53 in reward points that I had and after tax it came out to $125.66. I also get back 3% on my card if I shop at Amazon too, so I guess I'll get it even cheaper, $121.89 to be exact if my math is right.  I'm pretty psyched that I got a pretty good deal. What sucked though was I had made the purchase with another card because I get 5% cash back with Amazon purchases and then saw the deal about using your Amazon visa card and went to change my payment method. I then realized that in order to make the purchase work, you had to use a promo code and there was no way to enter the code after you have made the purchase. So I canceled my order and then when I went back to put it in my cart and checkout, the price was $179.00. I was so mad. I noticed that it said I had already claimed the item, even though I had just canceled my order. So luckily my partner had an account as well and made the purchase for me under his account, but with my card.   I was thinking that if anyone didn't get this deal and have an Amazon visa card, maybe you can call Amazon and tell them that you didn't see the promotion until after you had made the purchase, and that you didn't want to cancel the order because you would not be able to make the same purchase for the deal price. I would give it a try, you don't have anything to lose.  I'll try and post some pics of my first sous vide steak I make. Can't wait to taste it. Good luck to anyone who tries to call and hope you can all get the promo."
sousvide,3dfxx2,LocutusOfOrc,2,Wed Jul 15 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"I cook them, then freeze them, still in the unopened bag with whatever marinade. I find it's almost as easy to do four steaks at once as one or two.   Fridge defrost, then sear before serving - which tends to warm them through enough to serve."
sousvide,3dfxx2,Jungies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:08:23 2015 UTC,Does the texture of the meat change at all by doing this? I was curious about freezing pre-cooked bags myself to make for easier meal prep.
sousvide,3dfxx2,tonyblitz,2,Sun Jul 19 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"I freeze them with no salt, just the steaks.  Then into a hot bath.  Don't notice any difference other than an extra 10 minutes for the steak to defrost."
sousvide,3dfxx2,altum,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"I tried making pre-bagged steaks just as you're thinking.  Some butter, herbs, and a tablespoon of kosher salt.  But I didn't spread the salt over the meat, thinking the salt would dissolve into the bag juices and distribute itself during cooking.  Well, I wound up with really salty spots on the meat.  But even when I spread the salt around, it didn't really do much other than alleviate the salty spots.    So now I don't salt in the bag.  Instead, I salt the meat right before the sear."
sousvide,3dfxx2,tjeffer886-stt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:14 2015 UTC,I do not salt before vac-pack. It's just the meat.  I'm starting to experiment with starting with cold water and a frozen steak. They say it impacts the precision but given the range for steak I can't say it'd really matter. Short cook things? I see it.

As in, wake up, (ribs are already dry rub prepped in vac sealed bag in freezer from my rib stocks) throw in sous vide. Come home from work, take ribs out of bath, cover ribs with a ton of BBQ sauce, place in oven for about 20mins at 290 F just to crisp the sauce up.  It's not ""fall-off the bone"" but they are very close to fall-off which I how I like them. They pull off with a small amount of force leaving nothing behind, which I find easier as if they are fall-off, they can be a pain handling from vac-bag to oven.  You might need to experiment with temp as I had to to get them wife acceptable with varying ribs from different suppliers. Sometimes the ones I get from the local supermarket in a pinch have a lot more fat on them, but my regular butcher's full ribs are very trim.  Now yes, this is all the opposite of what people are saying, but i'm coming at this from the lazy-man's perspective.

So, make a big pot of stew, seal, then toss in and let it roll. For obvious reasons things that don't need to retain structure (stew) is better than things that do (lasagna.)  I would experiment with starting with an ice water bath and lower temps so that you can run the thing all day (8 hours) and not impact the quality.

If I can cook it hot and fast (eg a steak/tri tip/pork chops) I just bring it to temp. 2 hours max at whatever serving temp I like.    If it's tough as nails (eg short ribs, tongue, etc) I adjust the time and/or temp higher. This requires trial and error.

sousvide,3dc4wn,XenoRyet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the results have different temps too - don't forget that getting the desired texture is a function of time and temp. High temp, less time; low temp, more time.   ""Doneness"" will vary based on the final temperature as well - if you want it rare, it'll be a longer cook at a lower temp, if you want it medium, higher temp, less time. If you want it well-done, well, pressure-cook it."
sousvide,3dc4wn,moikederp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:59 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the wildly different times as well.  All I can tell you is I did tri-tip for 3 hours and it was great. At 3 hours it's safe for sure. I don't know how short you can go, but consider that it's pyramid shaped.  More time is a texture thing.  I'm glad I didn't go the long route (like 48-72 hours) for sure."
sousvide,3dc4wn,icecow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"When I do catering I usually do 3-4 hours at 140, chill them off and stash them in fridge before grilling for service.   At home I would do 130 for 5-6 hours, and finish in cast iron with butter or on grill. I have done it for significantly longer, but the texture can get a bit mushy and no one likes that."

I haven't tried a cut with lots of collagen, which I understand would be the ideal cut for a long braise style sous vide cook. Incidentally, my wife (god bless her) cooks the Tri tip in a crockpot like a roast for 8 hours. While it definitely gets flaky like a roast the low fat content makes it dry and low on flavor when cooked that way IMO. That is what spurred me to ask before trying it, just to make sure I was on the right track."

Reduce a little more, add a pat or two of butter, swirl around until dissolved. Put the chicken on egg noodles, top with the sauce, and squirt of lemon juice, and some chopped up parsley.  Goes together pretty quick, add a steamed veggie on the side and it good on a weeknight.  It's like poor man's chicken piccata (without the breading and such).

sousvide,3d7wax,phbarnhart,10,Tue Jul 14 05:09:30 2015 UTC,Neat concept but (to me anyway) it shares the same downfall as the SVS: Size. It's actually worse since the water bath is 9x7x4. That's RIDICULOUSLY small. It's literally like a single really thick steak or two normal sized steaks. Forget about ribs or doing anything for a crowd.

sousvide,3d7wax,BellaFiat,3,Tue Jul 14 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"I've been mentally paying with the idea of seeing up a remote Bluetooth controller for my anova which has a phone app to set temp and time.  At the same time, a delayed start would mean leaving whatever you're cooking in room temp water for hours.  EDIT: The closest I've gotten to an ""easy"" work around is to install a mobile OS simulator (bluestacks or something) on my PC that has Bluetooth, then from distance remote desktop into my pc and then use the app.  Overall, more work then I would want to put in for a theoretical set and forget.  It's a shame (although smart) that I can't use an outlet timer to control the power on timing (although I've also thought about using it to turn it off and then just bringing everything back to temp during the searing process.)"
sousvide,3d7wax,IAmA_Kitty_AMA,4,Tue Jul 14 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Well you could always add ice to the water bath before leaving it with the timer. Once the Anova turns on the water would melt the ice and cook your food once it got up to temp. You would lose a bit of volume of water going from ice to water but as long as your container is big enough it shouldn't be much of a problem.
sousvide,3d7wax,elangomatt,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"If we could get the Amazon Echo, which has Bluetooth, to control the anova directly that would be great.

sousvide,3d7wax,Montgomery0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I was wondering... How much longer it would take to get to temp and be in the ""danger zone"".  It'd be worth an experiment."
sousvide,3d7wax,rawditor,2,Tue Jul 14 14:48:35 2015 UTC,"According to Google, with a perfectly insulated container, the Anova can heat 19 liters (~5 gallons) of water by 36 degrees C per hour.  As soon as the last of the ice melts (so that you have just 0°C water), it would reach the danger zone in ~7 minutes (4°C), and leave the zone after 100 minutes (60 °C), which would make it 93 minutes total in the danger zone.  A real system will be slower, since some of the heat is lost to the environment, but if the limit is 2 hours in the danger zone, then it seems like it is probably doable, especially if you use a really well insulated container. We are also more liberal with the danger zone than the official 4°C-60°C range."
sousvide,3d7wax,avidiax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best ""bandaid"" along with the remote Bluetooth mentioned above. Your food will say safe in the container with ice.

sousvide,3d7wax,death_hawk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:28 2015 UTC,That is an interesting idea. I wonder about the safety though. Going from an ice bath to cook temps could take a while and leave food in the danger zone for too long.  I might give it a test later today though to see.
sousvide,3d7wax,JimJalinsky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming you minimize time in the danger zone outside of cooking, you should be fine. I can't see it taking more than an hour (or two tops) for a reasonabe sized container.   I wonder if that's why OP's unit is so small. I mean... I could fill my full size container with ice. It'd keep things nice and icy. But it'd take forever to come up to temp."
sousvide,3d7wax,death_hawk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:38:51 2015 UTC,I bet the small size is because 1) It's an all in one unit and so being much bigger would be impractical. 2) It has to be an all in one unit to match the chiller capacity with the water volume.
sousvide,3d7wax,JimJalinsky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:43:19 2015 UTC,"Chillers are hard to add because they are large units and cant easily be used to chill a different sized bath than the one that is built in, they are also pretty expensive."

Everyone here is a food geek, and you're all approaching the idea from the perspective of a food geek.  Some of here have even built their own sous vide machine from Make Magazine.  We're food hackers; toying with recipes, tools, techniques and styles that are on the bleeding edge of science and artistry.  This device is for the plebeian.  This is for the upper middle class person who doesn't care about the science or the artistry, or even being particularly clever.  This is for the person who wants to dump their food in a bag, drop it in the water, and go to work knowing a decent meal will be waiting for them when they return home.  I applaud this device for what it is, but I'm not going to stop throwing giant switches during thunderstorms while waiting for Igor to return from picking up another batch of steaks."

sousvide,3d7wax,StraightoutaBrompton,2,Tue Jul 14 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"I think your argument has a few flaws in it.  First, this doesn't make Sous Vide a method for the plebian at all.  The way you describe it the person would come home to a horribly unattractive piece of meat.  It still needs to be seared, and that is not yet a process without a learning curve.  Also, even a plebian might want to cook diner for a handful of guests, which would be hard with such a small volume.  Sure, the app is a step above what came before it, and the refrigeration is a semi useful idea, but this product won't remove the need for some level of foodgeek to use with any success."

sousvide,3d74c4,thewombbroom,2,Tue Jul 14 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"What would you recommend as a garnish? I was thinking of using some of the fennel fronds, but there weren't that many and i decided to bag them with the salmon instead."
sousvide,3d74c4,thewombbroom,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"Fennel fronds would be good as a start - chopped fine.  I would start with a sauce for sure - a simple butter, white wine, lemon reduction that would eliminate the lemon wedge.  Capers would be good as well.  More importantly though you should do some stacking - I'd go beet greens on bottom, then salmon, then slaw on top - sauce and capers around the edges.  Finally - leave the skin on the salmon if you have the opportunity and char the skin side after it comes out of the bag."
sousvide,3d74c4,Endur,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I actually skinned the salmon as I'm looking to use crispy salmon skin in a salad later this week.   A lemon, butter, wine sauce did cross my mind but I'm trying to cut back a bit on calories so I just went with the wedge.  But yeah, using one next time, with capers would be a solid addition.   Will definitely sauce and stack next time! Thanks for the advice!"
sousvide,3d74c4,thewombbroom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:48:07 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the simple sauce? I've only made a few and the recipes were fairly involved. I'm looking for something really easy that I can throw on a pre-cooked and frozen chicken breast
sousvide,3d74c4,Battle-Corgi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of elaborate recipes out there I'm sure.  I don't really use recipes except as a general guide for times/temps or flavor combinations so here's what I would do if I were going to make a simple white wine sauce.  I'd finely chop a shallot and two cloves of garlic and saute until soft in olive oil.  You can also add a light herb like fresh thyme, a tsp or two.  Then about a cup of white wine and simmer until reduced by half.  Then I would mount it with butter.  You can read about mounting sauces with butter online.  I'd hit it with some salt and finally, in a seafood application I would probably finish with a squeeze of lemon juice as it came off the stove. At this point, you can decide if you want to strain out the vegetables and herbs for presentation or leave them in.  Up to you."

sousvide,3d6ve1,TomEdison43050,3,Tue Jul 14 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"I have the Iwatani, and it works fine.  I don't have a Searzall, but I understand that the biggest difference is that the Iwatani has a rather focused flame and will torch an area about the size of a half a dollar.  You need to move it around more to get it to sear evenly.  The Searzall will have a much more diffuse area and will be much easier to sear a wider area more evenly."

sousvide,3d6ve1,flaker111,2,Tue Jul 14 10:32:53 2015 UTC,"I have the searszall and it's great but it's not ""fast"" as a ""naked"" flame. Where it does excell it gives you great control over the searing but if you plan on searing more than 2 steaks it just becomes cumbersome. I use the benzomatic ts4000 myself (~40 for the head and 6 bucks for 2 canister tanks). To give you an idea of what the searszall does, if you take a raw egg and tries to sear it the top would only cook and yolk would stay raw underneath"
sousvide,3d6ve1,Corpsman223,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:29:51 2015 UTC,Read a lot of reviews.  It's good for somethings but read up before you leap. Good luck.
sousvide,3d6ve1,death_hawk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"I have both and I use both for different reasons.    For those times I'm too lazy to dry my food, I pass an Iwatani over it. I rarely use it for searing because I can regularly taste the torch. The Searzall is much slower but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I tend to burn things more with the Iwatani than a Searzall.    At the end of the day if I had to pick one, I'd probably pick the Searzall. This isn't what you want to hear if you're price conscious as the TS8000 plus Searzall is close to an order of magnitude more expensive. But for me it's more versatile.    Since the Iwatani is only like $20 I'd grab one anyway. If you don't like it, it's not a huge investment."
sousvide,3d6ve1,mofish1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's decent but not a gamechanger.  I'll never try to sear scallops with it again, takes too long.  Did a great job of toasting meringue on a cake, though"

sousvide,3d6ve1,awkwardsoul,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"I have the Searzall with TS8000. I've used it to sear 8 steaks for a dinner party so it's do able for large groups - the only draw back is they all won't be ready at the same time / you need to have warmed plates. It does quick work since it's got a big surface area, so doing creme brulee is super fast. The tanks last a long time too, I've had mine for 7 months, use it couple times a week (just a family of 2 with monthly dinner party and work trip), and it's close to an empty tank now.  The flavor is good. I used regular torches a lot before and really hated that torch taste it left, and there was less control so stuff would get burned fast."
sousvide,3d6ve1,babybluebentley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:06 2015 UTC,In my opinion you are better off using a hot pan and drying whatever food you are searing thoroughly
sousvide,3d4zje,tommy1005,3,Mon Jul 13 15:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yes - for precision outcomes.  No it doesn't beep. Keep your eye on it.  You don't have to get a food sealer, but it's more convenient, and it ensures that all surfaces of your food are touched by the water.  There are varying opinions on what type/brand of vacuum sealer to buy. I would suggest researching and finding what works best for you."
sousvide,3d4zje,FLAMINGCUMBOX,0,Mon Jul 13 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yea that's my concern about using my own bags, the surfaces might not all get cooked which would suck."
sousvide,3d4zje,HerpDerpinAtWork,3,Mon Jul 13 17:50:28 2015 UTC,"Ziploc brand freezer bags are just fine for the vast majority of cooks, and if you seal them right, you definitely don't have to worry about surfaces not getting cooked. I've done everything from 45 minute fish cooks to hours-long steak cooks to 36 hour pork roasts with this method and have never had a problem. Make sure you get the Ziploc brand freezer bags with the sturdy double-seal at the top. Knock-off bags tend to be prone to failure."
sousvide,3d4zje,LordeApple,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:06 2015 UTC,Is it ok to use standard ziploc food storage bags? They don't appear to sell ziploc freezer bags where I live (New Zealand).
sousvide,3d4zje,LecheConCarnie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:46 2015 UTC,I would recommend against it.  Regular bags are too thin
sousvide,3d4zje,vtron,2,Tue Jul 14 11:34:16 2015 UTC,I've only used ziplocks and never had an issue.  That includes a 60 hour brisket.  Just use the water immersion sealing technique.
sousvide,3d4zje,kmbb,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"I also support using ziplocks right now. Figure out what sealer you want later on, but for tonight you'll have plenty of fun and great outcomes with some ziplock bags."
sousvide,3d4zje,SecureThruObscure,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"1) yes  2) not sure. I have an anova. Basic idea is the same, you're going to love it!   3) I have a food saver and I've been picking up food saver bags. I saw some generic ones cheaper, but they didn't have the diamond pattern for sucking out the air and in my experience (my grandma used them, iirc) they leave air pockets.   No matter what brand you go with, just make sure it creates a good seal and the bags are relatively sturdy.   I really recommend getting a sealer. It'll make your life easier and it's handy for other stuff too.   If you'd like to cook and freeze (say, doing 12-14 breasts at a time and having a few weeks worth for a family), cook in batches, want to cook for long durations or just want less risk of water getting into your food, you definitely want a sealer.   What's your first planned recipe?    You must try chicken breasts at 140F for 90m, sometime soon. They're amazing.   I recommend getting a thermometer and checking your unit. Just make sure it is making the water the right temperature.  Shorter cooks are probably easier to start off with, sort of getting your feet wet. After your comfortable with the basic ideas, timing, etc. but once you've gotten comfortable a 48+ hour cook is a great experiment.  I haven't done those as often, but the results are really interesting.   Do you have a good timing guide so you know how long to cook what?  I tend to use google and chef steps/serious eats as a primary with some of the manufacturer specifics as back ups."
sousvide,3d4zje,SecureThruObscure,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, looking forward to the chicken breasts! I guess I would sear them too after they have been sous vided?"
sousvide,3d4zje,Supposably,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:50:03 2015 UTC,That depends on how you'd like to serve them.   Something really easy and no sear needed is balsamic vinaigrette and sliced tomato (Kumato are very good).

sousvide,3d4zje,vtron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:02 2015 UTC,"Sous vide chicken in a bag, with rosemary. About a dash per breast in the bag. After the first time you'll see if it's too much. Use a different spice if you like, or even a combination. My wife likes Rosemary.   Take it out of the bag, slice a tomato.   Put the tomato on top of the chicken breast, or beside it. Drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette. You can make your own or buy it at the store. I just buy the reduction at the store."
sousvide,3d4zje,fawsewlaateadoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"I did chicken teriyaki last night.  Rubbed the chicken with salt, pepper, and ginger.  Then added just a bit of teriyaki sauce to the bag and cooked them at 145.  Took them out of the bath and did a light sear, then added the rest of the sauce and let it cook down for a couple minutes.    It was restaurant quality chicken teriyaki.  Moist, flavorful chicken with a crazy good sauce.  I can't believe it took me this long to make my own teriyaki sauce."

The automatic models don't work very well).  That being said, Filet Mignon is the WRONG steak to be doing sous vide. It's already tender as mush and you can cook it in 5 minutes in a pan.   I would strongly recommend you look into some of the other steak cuts that work much better (NY Strip, Rib, etc). Or start with one of the longer cooks with tough meat where sous vide really shines (beef ribs, brisket, pork chops)."

I am not the greatest at plating, and i had three plates to make, but it turned out really good. I keep thinking if i just had rotated the steak slightly it would have been a better picture but i really kind of took it on the fly so everyone could eat.   I think though next time I'll try to get closer to 7 or 8 hours on the bison to make it more tender, it was really good but i think i can improve."

In that window the chicken will be the same (it's very hard to overcook with sous vide, not sure how familiar you are with the process).

I'm sure you could be a little more careful and go with 4 layers instead of doubling up the ""strip"" but I still question the integrity of the seals considering that Foodsavers don't even like doing the regular two layer properly.    I always double sealed my Foodsavers when I had it since they leaked like a sieve."
sousvide,3d1ua2,crimsonfancy,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:40:33 2015 UTC,Just get a chamber machine once and use the appropriate bags imo. Foodsavers machines don't last and will need replacing.

sousvide,3d1ua2,death_hawk,0,Mon Jul 13 02:44:30 2015 UTC,Yeah really. I've gone through a half dozen machines. Foodsavers are awful. I've spent more money on Foodsaver machines that I have chamber machines. I wish I knew what I did a bunch of years ago and just bought a chamber to begin with.
sousvide,3d1ua2,KimcheeBreath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:35 2015 UTC,not sure why you got downvoted... I have had 3 foodsaver type machines.    first one the gasket got too compressed and was allowing air to come in and it would never hit the vacuum needed to trigger the seal bar to turn on.  A new gasket would have been great but the machine was very old and the cost of the gasket was not worth it.  second one The sealer would allow so much liquid/blood to come in that half the seals would fail due to the liquid and the other half of the time I would need to wash and sterilize the entire fucking machine making it a pain in the ass to use for anything wet.   I would use a dissinfecting spray on the gasket and it ended starting to disintegrate.     third one I got a really high end one as a gift to replace my crummy ones.  It was nice! but after seeing how much it cost i was like hell no and returned it.  I figured at that price I could just get a vacmaster instead.  I wish I had just done this from the beginning but then again Vacmansters werent as cheap then as they are now.  Learn from the people on here telling you to get a chamber vac.  If you do a fair amount of vacuum sealing it will pay for itself over time and you will just kick urself for having waited so long.
sousvide,3d1ua2,death_hawk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:46:13 2015 UTC,I'm betting it's people who have Foodsavers and are mad that they have Foodsavers. Cheap consumer garbage.
sousvide,3d1ua2,KimcheeBreath,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:47 2015 UTC,I dont consider them garbage but if you are serious about sous videing then you need to get serious about vacuuming.  Foodsavers are fine for the occasional dry vac.  They even excel in very very long items that wont fit into a chamber vac but if you are vacuuming tens to hundreds of items a month then a chamber vac is the way to go.

sousvide,3d0bw3,famasfilms,8,Sun Jul 12 12:33:02 2015 UTC,Chicken shows off the sous vide pretty well.  I always have trouble with legs and thighs on the grill burning before being cooked through.  Do them sous vide with a bit of BBQ in the bag and just sear on the grill with BBQ sauce after.
sousvide,3d0bw3,lantech,2,Sun Jul 12 12:55:50 2015 UTC,Sous vide chicken thighs are so good. I like to do 90 min at 145. Never really liked thighs until I started cooking them sous vide.

In my experience  (I cook professionally and use SV quite a lot) red muscle meat is what really shines going through the SV process. At the same time I became a little weary of the tendency of over-slow-cooking with circulator. Not everything needs to be fork tender. I want my grilled meat to have a little bite to it, not necessarily melt in my mouth. I've played with different temps and time more than anything with short ribs and I would suggest a 36-42 hours. It's plenty to upgrade a cheaper cut into something to remember but it still retains the original grilling texture and consistency."
sousvide,3d0bw3,ivanbeacco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely... short rib, tri tip, steak, all great options. Salmon shines via this method and you can finish it on the grill with direct heat for a minute or two.   If you are feeling adventurous, you can sous vide octopus and char it on the grill. It really does a great job at tenderizing a protein that could easily turn out chewy. Serve it with some romesco sauce.   Or try some chicken hearts with some sauce in the bag (like a yakitori or teriyaki) and finished in the grill as skewers brushed with some of the same sauce."
sousvide,3d0bw3,boarfox,9,Sun Jul 12 19:36:49 2015 UTC,"I did pork chops the other day and they were fantastic. boneless skinless, some salt and pepper on the outside, 135-140 for 2-3 hours, seared on a hot grill (make sure to sear the fat cap). They were juicy and tender. If you want a sauce, I just tossed some cherry tomatoes in a pan with olive oil and some minced garlic, let them cook until pressing with a spatula would pop the tomatoes, then added a splash of soy sauce and lemon juice. Was delicious."
sousvide,3d0bw3,dagaetch,5,Sun Jul 12 13:33:06 2015 UTC,"Probably not the best choice, but my first experience for my family in sous vide was tri-tip.

Well my dad brought out the bbq tri-tip and I seared off my tri-tip and let everyone taste the difference side by side. Everyone raved just how soft and tender the SV one was."

sousvide,3cut7z,the-incredible-ape,2,Sat Jul 11 19:25:17 2015 UTC,is the texture such that you could make carpaccio with it?  I dunno if it would be good but it'd make a huge impression if you posted photos on r/food XD
sousvide,3cut7z,lessthanadam,3,Sat Jul 11 20:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was, but now I've had it marinating for some time, and I also bought it on a Friday, which could indicate it's a bit older than what you'd eat raw. The next time I buy it, I'll ensure it's absolutely fresh and compare how the carpaccio holds up to the cooked servings."

sousvide,3cut7z,JimJalinsky,7,Sat Jul 11 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"Hi, for some strange reason (<- EDIT: this is a poor attempt at humor), the usual sous vide sites doesn't have cooking recommendations for whale, and I'm wondering if anyone here have tried it. The meat is currently marinating in red whine, cloudberry vinegar, rosemary and garlic, and will do so for about 18 more hours.    I found some recommendations for baking large (2-3 kg) steaks that recommended 57C (134.6F) for bloody and 68C (154.4F) for well done, and another source recommended 60C (140F), which I think I'm going for. The biggest problem is that whale meat doesn't like prolonged heating, which makes it chewy and hard, but I'm not sure if that is only true for pan frying (which is the only preparation I've got experience with) and not for low heat cooking like sous vide.    Have anyone here tried to cook whale sous vide, and if so, what duration are you recommending? I'm currently considering keeping it at absolute minimum based the thickness in order to achieve the uniform temperature, probably somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes, but I haven't checked the cooking tables for a while.    Any other recommendations?"
sousvide,3cut7z,Ekaros,6,Fri Jul 10 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"Well whatever you do, make sure you let us know how it turns out!"
sousvide,3cut7z,kliman,5,Sat Jul 11 11:02:20 2015 UTC,"I will. I think I'll end up dividing it in pieces and check how the meat changes over time in the water bath, so there will be opportunities for photos and science."
sousvide,3cut7z,the-incredible-ape,4,Sat Jul 11 12:59:52 2015 UTC,"do you have any idea what other meat it's like?  whales are mamals, so maybe its like chicken thigh meat.  maybe lop off a few small chunks and test cook them a few different ways.  actually, yay.  cut off some small bite sized pieces, cook them in a pan for various times to get an idea of texture/flavors."

sousvide,3cut7z,dertigo,5,Sat Jul 11 01:05:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think that's a smart recommendation. The meat is safe (and recommended) to eat raw, so I think I'll pick the minimum recommendation for tenderloin at that thickness to ensure I'm at least not overcooking it."
sousvide,3cut7z,Corpsman223,3,Sat Jul 11 02:08:55 2015 UTC,probably just go with recs for really lean game meat...?  So I'd guess like 1h around 130F should give you good results.  The thing i'm not sure about is searing and how that'd be best handled.

The most recent time, I must have caught it early, because the temp was only down to 120F.  I judged that the meat (short ribs) couldn't have been in the danger zone more than 15 mins, so I just reset the temp and resumed cooking. Everything turned out fine and I didn't die.   The other time, my temp had fallen to 80F, which means it had to have been in the danger zone for hours (I use an insulated ice chest with a lid). That one went straight into the trash.   Ultimately, you're doing guesswork to figure out how long your meat was in the danger zone. If it was in that temp range for a while, regardless of whether you pasteurized first, you're asking for trouble.  You might be ok, but . . ."

sousvide,3csf1z,icecow,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:04:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty new to sous vide cooking but based on this table to determine time/temp needed for pasteurization your short ribs would have been perfectly safe to eat.
sousvide,3csf1z,okDoctorJones,8,Fri Jul 10 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"your short ribs would have been perfectly safe to eat.   I wouldn't be so sure. After 2.5 days at 138F the bag is pasteurized. This means that enough bacteria has been killed (up to some tiny decimal) that it's for all practical purposes safe. However, then being left at < 130F for however long means that any bacteria that hasn't been killed could have multiplied. It's entirely possible, depending on many factors, that the level of bacteria after the machine shutoff is now risen to an unsafe level."
sousvide,3csf1z,cosimothecat,5,Fri Jul 10 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, too many people forget that pasteurized doesn't mean sterile. There's still going to be some tiny amount of pathogens left that can rapidly multiply if you aren't careful with your temperatures."
sousvide,3csf1z,RickWino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are definitely right that it would be good environment for food pathogens to reach an unsafe levels as the temp decreased. I didn't think of it like that. And I should NOT have worded that as an absolute, also.   But considering that they were in a bath for around 60 hours at 138F before the temp decrease, I would eat them. That's just my opinion tho."
sousvide,3csf1z,okDoctorJones,2,Fri Jul 10 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"But considering that they were in a bath for around 60 hours at 138F before the temp decrease, I would eat them. That's just my opinion tho.   If the temperature decreased for only an hour or two, I might eat it as well. But what if the temperature decreased for 8-12hrs? would you then? I wouldn't."
sousvide,3csf1z,cosimothecat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:10:34 2015 UTC,pasteurization doesn't sterilize the meat and any bacteria that were left over would have had ample time to multiply  and make the meat unsafe.

My advice is to do a few test runs with beef chuck roast for 48 hours at a few different temps to see what suits your tastes.  You can then be ready for the next potluck with something special.

I did hamburgers, boneless chicken breasts and boneless pork chops all at 140F for 2.5 hours.  Also served grilled Italian sausage but not sous vide.  They were all patted dry, seasoned and seared just before serving on a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill.  Basting the chicken breasts with Ghee allows a nice quick sear without overcooking. They all went into a warm serving pan and self serve from there."
sousvide,3cilb8,MrMajors,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:22:16 2015 UTC,How packed was the cooler? Do you worry about the water not circulating enough?

I cook them to 130-135 F (depending on desired doneness) for 2 hours... Doing 1 bag at a time (20 patties), I pat them dry, throw them on an open-lid hot grill (500-600 F) for 30 seconds, flip them, cheese them (""cracker cut"" pre-sliced cheese is sized perfectly and available in cheddar, swiss, jack, pepper jack, gouda, blue, etc...), and blow torch the cheese while the other side cooks for another 30 seconds... I could probably do 2 bags (40 patties) at once, but it gets hectic trying to manage so many - plus, doing 1 bag at a time keeps a nice stream of constantly hot burgers coming (this assumes there's a moment when ""Dinner's served!"" as opposed to wanting food to be available for a prolonged period)... if you can't find buns specifically for mini hamburgers or sliders, sliced dinner rolls work perfectly... open the right number of buns and lay them out on a cookie sheet or cutting board before putting them on the grill and you can go from water bath to serving in 3-5 minutes (perfect for actually enjoying your party)... I also throw a couple packs of hot dogs in the sous vide bath and grill them alongside the burgers (bonus: they come pre-vacuum packed from the store)..."
sousvide,3cilb8,BellaFiat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:20:13 2015 UTC,Sliders are a pretty good idea. I imagine with a large enough container you could prep a ton of them. I wonder if there is some way to make the bagging easier. Maybe doing White Castle style square burgers?

sousvide,3cilb8,Fat_ass_tic,0,Wed Jul 8 16:03:08 2015 UTC,I didn't. I think they would have been even better if I had but I was cooking for enough people that just getting them on the table was enough. I thought that people were going to use quite a bit of BBQ sauce on these but people were just taking them down without it.   I really don't think it would have been a problem to just put someone on grill duty to sear on the grill (without any fear of messing them up) but I was just focused on other things.

sousvide,3ckeoc,Megamansdick,0,Wed Jul 8 21:50:37 2015 UTC,I actually left my mason jars on the counter overnight to cool.   Filled with your custard mix? I'm not sure that's a great idea.

sousvide,3ckeoc,Montgomery0,2,Wed Jul 8 22:10:24 2015 UTC,I have literally used this recipe 100 times.

Sous Vide Supreme  150 mL Le Cruset ramekins With a lid. 190 F for 20 to 30 minutes depending on how warm the mix is  when you pour into the ramekins.  500 mL Heavy cream (1/2 liter container) 250 mL of  3%  milk 1/4 cup white sugar + 1/4 cup light brown sugar  = 125 mL total sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla paste 2 tsp vanilla  3 drops lime extract 1/4 tsp cardamom 9 EGG YOLKS
sousvide,3ckeoc,tsdguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:09:28 2015 UTC,so 190F for only 30 minutes is enough time/temp to cook creme brulee?  The recipe you're using uses a lot of yolks.  I'll put your recipe down on my SV Todo List.
sousvide,3ckeoc,Ikeelu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"Did they jiggle like jello when you tapped them or were they simply liquid?  If you tilted a regular creme brulee enough it would flow out of the container as well (while still hot.)  Did you let them set in the fridge for a few hours?  If you look at the recipe, it's mostly fat and sugar, so you should expect it to be pretty fragile while it's still warm."
sousvide,3ci1fh,2pt5RS,2,Wed Jul 8 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"I think you should forget about steak or any very heat sensitive food. Bringing anova to work and cook your lunch for an hour seems very overkill for the so-so result you are going to get with this method.   The best sear (actually called reverse sear) is after the sous vide cooking.   your option here might be stews. Sear meat cubes, slow cook for 8h+ or following the recipe you want and but individually portion it in different bags.  Then bring the sous vide bag to work and simply reheat in warm water for a few minutes."

sousvide,3cfb0q,TheBurningBeard,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:52 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Cheap or chamber. Nothing in between makes a big difference.
sousvide,3cfb0q,herpnderplurker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"if you shop equipment liquidation auctions, you might be able to snag a second hand one for less than $200.  Otherwise, I'm fine with my $50 foodsaver."
sousvide,3cfb0q,StraightoutaBrompton,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"Then I say go thrifting. I have found a cheap ziplock vacuum  sealer that i've been using for the past 2 years for 15 bucks. I also found a 160 dollar food saver, still in the box for 30 bucks. Most stick styles work about the same, avoid the small hand sized ones by all means."

sousvide,3cfb0q,zyphlox,3,Tue Jul 7 15:53:35 2015 UTC,I like the walmart version of ziplock.  Dunk in the sous vide water until its right below the top then seal it up.
sousvide,3cfb0q,gregcain,3,Tue Jul 7 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"I have found the basic type in thrift stores for next to nothing.  I have a Foodsaver I got for $4 and it's been working great a few months now.  I don't expect it to last forever but it is still economical.  I would consider investing in a chamber vac if I had the space.  Also, when I was shopping for a new one I thought I would want one with an integrated roll storage and cutter, but I've ended up mostly using pre-cut Weston bags anyway and I like the smaller size of the simple ones.  Make sure you get one that lies flat and has you close it on the bag end.  The vertical ones where you have to feed the bag end into a slot are a PITA."
sousvide,3cfb0q,moriya,3,Tue Jul 7 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"Foodsaver!  I'm on my second Foodsaver.  I sold the first one when I moved a few years ago - it was working great at the time. My second one needed the seals replaced, but it was cheap, and customer service was great.  I use the heck out of it, so I don't view the need for new seals as an issue.  Additionally, I got a great deal on it ($30 for a basic model.)    If you have access to Costco, they have a deal on one for $60 that's very nice."
sousvide,3cfb0q,gregcain,2,Tue Jul 7 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I second this. Vacmasters and other chamber vacs are great if you have the cash and the space - they're huge, and I personally don't have enough space in my kitchen for a monster like that. Foodsavers work surprisingly well, and if it starts to crap out after a few years, you can buy a new one. I'm more of a ""buy it for life"" kind of guy, but if you live in a small apartment I really don't see how you budget the room for a chamber vac in a well-stocked kitchen."
sousvide,3cfb0q,GhostFour,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention it, but you can also seal mason jars with the Foodsaver.  That's not really a sous vide use, but it does help you save money - buying in bulk, seal and freeze.  I do it with coffee, vegetables, fruit (blueberries...mmmm), etc."
sousvide,3cfb0q,lantech,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"OK, help me out guys.  I joined this sub because I was curious about sous vide so I don't have any experience.  That said, I have a Food Saver and use it to freeze food when we cook a large batch of something or get a good deal on chicken, etc...  To heat up the frozen food I usually drop it in a simmering pot of water but the seal seems to be hit or miss.  About 25% of the time I end up with a mess.  I started holding the lid down on the bag for a few seconds longer after the ""sealing"" light goes off, hoping the residual heat might expand the width of the seal a bit.  I also try to make sure I press across the entire width of the bag when sealing to make sure I don't have a spotty corner seal.  I'm not sure I've noticed an improvement in my broken seal % when reheating.  Do you guys double seal with the Foodsaver?  Seems like it creates more work (and bag waste) than I want to do, especially since when I use mine, I'm usually working on a large batch and end up making/sealing a dozen-ish bags.  Any ideas, suggestions, tips/tricks, etc... to help a Foodsaver user out?"
sousvide,3cfb0q,Excrucibo,2,Tue Jul 7 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"I've been doing multiple seals, like vaccum+seal then about 1/4 inch up seal again and if there's room another 1/4 inch up."
sousvide,3cfb0q,GhostFour,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:28:59 2015 UTC,Is the area around the seal free of food and water? Most of the time if I have a bad seal it's because water or food gets in the way of the seal.
sousvide,3cfb0q,gregcain,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:34:03 2015 UTC,If I'm sealing something with a lot of liquid I test the seals before freezing but I'm sure it could have a weak spot due to liquid that gives up while reheating.
sousvide,3cfb0q,GhostFour,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:59:11 2015 UTC,"Is the seal failing when you drop it in your simmering water?  I'm not sure what temperature these bags are rated at - for my Sous Vide, I've only gotten up to about 185, while a simmer should be closer to 212.  Like Excrucibo says, make sure the sealing area is clean and clear.  Liquids can cause you trouble too.  The double seal never hurts, but it does waste a tiny bit of the bag.    Is your unit new?  The seals eventually need to be replaced, but not for some time.  And if it can't make a vacuum, it won't try to seal the bag, at least on the model I have.  There's not too much more to it than that."
sousvide,3cfb0q,death_hawk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:33 2015 UTC,I have a couple.  One about 3 years old and another probably 2 years old I inherited when my chick's grandmother decided it wasn't worth the effort for her to use a sealer for herself.  I'll replace the seals on one to see if that helps.  I'm sure they are probably both ready for a little maintenance.  Thanks for the info.
sousvide,3cfb0q,hanlong,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:01:54 2015 UTC,"Do you guys double seal with the Foodsaver?    Yes. The seals on Foodsavers are shit. For expensive things I used to occasionally triple seal.      Any ideas, suggestions, tips/tricks, etc... to help a Foodsaver user out?     Sell it and buy a Chamber. I'm not even kidding either, especially if you're doing any sort of volume. A dozen bags a week will easily pay for the machine in a year."
sousvide,3cfb0q,Excrucibo,2,Thu Jul 9 21:16:44 2015 UTC,I use foodsaver. Works great.

I'm waiting to hear back from the warranty department since it's been just over 1 year since we bought it.  Edit: I have to rescind some of my less-than-stellar thoughts on FoodSaver. They just emailed me a response saying not only are they sending a pre-paid label to send the broken one back, but they're also shipping out a replacement unit at the same time."
sousvide,3cfb0q,GenkiLawyer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"I've had the food saver for a few years now, no issues and works great (seal has never failed) and fairly economical....about $70.00 (if memory serves) at Target."
sousvide,3cfb0q,Iced_TeaFTW,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"I use a sinbo nozzle sealer.  They are pretty rare, but the nozzle type vacuum allows you to use the cheap bags designed for chamber sealers instead of the expensive channel bags that most sealers require.  I buy mine in bulk for just a few cents per bag.  It makes it a ton cheaper than a foodsaver or similar brand in the long run."

I deep fried it for the pre-sear, and threw it in over night, and used the juice from the bag to make a really quick sauce after it was done cooking (a strange breakfast, but definitely a good one).  I didn't think the higher temp and shorter cook time made it dry or tough at all.  It was similar to traditional tender short ribs, and the shorter cook time means I will cook this much more often."
sousvide,3ce2k4,BrokelynNYC,4,Tue Jul 7 04:46:51 2015 UTC,"If it'll hold hot water, you can cook in it.  A cooler is cheap and comes with insulation, and you probably already have one.  A big pot will work fine too.  Polycarbonate is kinda cool because you can see the food as it cooks, but that's about the only reason to use it."
sousvide,3ce2k4,bonafidebob,3,Tue Jul 7 06:17:18 2015 UTC,"I have this container and this lid. I have an anova and it fits in very nicely. It's not too big that it'll be a hassle to store but it's big enough that I'll be able to cook pretty much anything I'd ever want to cook.  Some people say to avoid metal containers like large pots but my preference for polycarbonate is purely because I like to be able to see everything. You could probably use a cheap $5 stock pot if you want.  I've only ever used ziplock style bags and they work well most of the time. The only time I've ever had a problem was when I was making garlic confit but that's probably because I was doing ~90c for a few hours, I've never had any melting or leaking at ~50-60c (steaks, etc). Just buy bags that say BPA free, microwave safe & freezer safe. That way you know it should handle high heats (microwave safe) and it should be reasonably thick plastic and not easily tear or leak (freezer safe). If you are going to be doing high temp cooks or long cooks you absolutely need to buy a lid (or use foil)."

I simply placed a grill grate over the chimney and seared the steaks for a minute each side."
sousvide,3cbie2,crackills,8,Mon Jul 6 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"This is how i use charcoal. I don't even have a charcoal grill, just the chimney. Nice work btw."
sousvide,3cbie2,uberphaser,4,Mon Jul 6 20:28:43 2015 UTC,What'd you do with the charcoal after the steaks were done? Seems an awful waste of good coals. Hope you made some burgers!
sousvide,3cbie2,rsd212,5,Mon Jul 6 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"Close up the chimney in a kettle grill with the vents closed. The fire will burn out pretty quick, and the next day just bang the chimney around a bit to knock off some ash, top off with fresh, and re-light it. It works best with hardwood charcoal since there are likely to be some big chunks in there anyway that will now be burned down to a manageable size."
sousvide,3cbie2,uberphaser,2,Mon Jul 6 17:50:27 2015 UTC,I was testing the concept so I let the coals ash in the chimney after the steaks were done. You could certainly put the coals to use afterwards though.

sousvide,3cbie2,tsdguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:08:26 2015 UTC,I'd suggest putting something fire resistant (like half a fire brick) in the bottom of the chimney so you don't have to add as much charcoal.

sousvide,3cbie2,tsdguy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:05:46 2015 UTC,How do you get them white? Just let the chimney run for a long time?
sousvide,3cbie2,frigginwizard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:16:52 2015 UTC,Yes. The chimney creates a strong upflow of hot air which catches all of the charcoal very quickly and creates a jetflow of super hot air.  A full chimney can be going in about 10 minutes.

Couple changes we will make on the next ones, see below...  Method: two 2.5 lb Tri-tip steaks (yes, from Costco) 24hrs @ 134 F No seasoning at all in the bag - water displacement method Immediately afterward - plunge into ice bath for rapid chill (and to transport to friends house with BBQ) Prep smoker ""Hot Smoke"" >200 degrees F, indirect heat etc. 30 min before smoking, thoroughly dry the meat and let continue to air dry. So the meat goes on the smoker room temp/slightly chilled and bone dry outside. Smoke for ~2hrs, occasionally mopping with Sousvide drippings  Results: Fantastic. Excellent tender texture from the Sousvide - all the fat beautifully rendered etc. Bold smoky flavor. Great with or without any additional sauce.  Recommended changes: - drop temp by ~2-3 degrees. Will go with 24hr @ ~130 next time to help offset the time/heat variation in the smoker - salt prior to smoking. We added no extra seasoning at all, and just tried to let the meat and smoke do the work. Needed some (not much) salt."

It has these manual/auto locks on the side, the kind you press down on to both lock and unlock, which can be pretty helpful.  That said, always try using the ""pulse"" manual vacuum feature before vacuum sealing to make sure that it's actually tight enough to start vacuuming, or you're gonna end up with a non-vacuumed seal. You might have to push it down in the middle a smidgen while to help get it started."

If you want something more like pastrami, brine it for a few days (3-7 depending on the thickness) in a brine that includes some nitrates (you can also use celery salt which contains natural nitrates). Morton's makes a salt blend called 'tender quick' which is perfect for this. Once it's done, pat it dry and give it a hot sear on the grill or pan.

sousvide,3calf4,awkwardsoul,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"I feel the opposite - that people tend to overcook them.  People tend to overcook lean cuts whehter it's on the grill or the smoker.  I've eaten a ton of dry ribs that people have cooked.  Cooking them low temp achieves the fall off the bone upside of a real long smoke, but without having to watch your smoker temp all day.  Braising them in an oven is fine, but with how much oven temps swing you can easily end up with ribs that are too tender and aren't on the bone anymore.    It might not be the biggest advantage, but it's a whole lot more consistent, and with something as lean as a baby back rib I'll take that advantage"
sousvide,3calf4,rmm989,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:15 2015 UTC,Agree. There's no advantage and a big disadvantage. Sealed there's no way for the moisture to be released resulting in mushy ribs. I find it also gives them a funky taste.  If you can't BBQ them or smoke them you can do OK cooking in the oven. The dry heat condenses the flavor which is just what you want.

This approach is similar.  Usually for tough cuts, 12-72 hours at low-ish temps can do wonderful things. Pork shoulder for 2 days at 143° will end up with a consistency like pork chops. But I guess with ribs, you want that pull-apart texture in the meat and you want the connective tissue softened enough to eat without gristle, which is why they suggest a higher temp and faster cook. You'll end up with what you expect out of ribs.  It's definitely worth trying at a low temp for longer, but it probably won't eat like standard ribs. You might have to slice and serve it differently."

sousvide,3c9d6l,tonyblitz,6,Mon Jul 6 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you didn't sear/blanch the meat before bagging it.    That funky/cheesy/dry-aged smell after a long cook is often attributed to the growth of bacteria on the surface of the meat like Lactobacillus, which can still live at that temp/time range.  Before bagging, a quick sear or a quick dip in boiling water can help alleviate it (just takes a few seconds to kill off the surface bacteria).  Boiling is probably more thorough than searing though, since the water can hit all the nooks and crannies searing won't.  The time/temp safety charts are for the relevant pathogenic bacteria, the bad ones that'll make you sick like Salmonella.  Other stuff that won't make you sick (like Lactobacillus) can still grow.   tl;dr - Yes, steaks at 130-140°F for those times are safe.  Sear or briefly blanch before bagging to minimize the funky smell from other stuff growing."

sousvide,3c9d6l,comfyhead,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think blanching is generally quicker, though I suppose it can take a little while to bring the water to a boil (although during that time you can be doing other things).  With a blowtorch, it may take a while to rotate the food(s) around and hit every surface evenly.    As for dunking a sealed bag into boiling water, it still wouldn't hit all the nooks and crannies, at least in a reasonable amount of time."
sousvide,3c9d6l,Goonie_GooGoo,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"Best way is probably the deep fryer for say 90 seconds. Failing that, boiling water for same amount of time.

As you say, a good blanch in boiling water for a couple of minutes, or a sear in the deep fryer (my usual method) will almost always take any bacteria populations well below the thresholds where they can creat problems even with 72 hour cooking times.  A lot of people don't realize that even if some bacteria can survive and reproduce at 130, they do it much more slowly than they would at the really dangerous temps between about 60-110f. If you start with a population of two bacteria and they reproduce every hour, a 72 hour cook is dangerous.

sousvide,3c9nxq,hadronshire,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"Romesco:       Romesco (Catalan pronunciation: [ruˈmɛsku]) is a nut and red pepper-based sauce originated from Tarragona, Catalonia, the Northeastern Spain. The fishermen in this area made this sauce to eat with fish.  It is typically made from any mixture of roasted or raw almonds, pine nuts, and/or hazelnuts, roasted garlic, olive or sunflower oil, bitxo peppers (similar to New Mexico chiles) and/or nyora peppers (a sun dried, small, round variety of red bell pepper). Flour or ground stale bread may be used as a thickener or to provide texture. Other common ingredients include roasted tomatoes, red wine vinegar and onions. Leaves of fennel or mint may be added, particularly if served with fish or escargot. It is very often served with seafood, but can also be served with a wide variety of other foods, including poultry and some red meats like lamb and vegetables. During the springtime, salsa romesco is served as an accompanying dip for calçots, a spring onion typical to Catalonia, during traditional springtime calçot barbecues called ""calçotades"". During calçotades, calçots are roasted over an open fire until their outer layer is charred. The charred layer is then removed and the tender part of the onion may be dipped into the romesco.

sousvide,3c9nxq,hadronshire,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:22 2015 UTC,So an option then is to puree the romesco for a longer time to get it smoother and add a liquid to thin it a little more. I personally would hesitate to add a sweet sauce with the dish you described. You will start to muddle flavors by having too many conflicting things on the plate.    Also you could amp up the tomato part of the romesco in order to sweeten in without making it sweet. This could help to counteract the tartness of the apples.

It's a pain in the ass to smoke up the entire building by trying to cook chicken breasts or steak on a pan with oil.   My home cooked meals were usually baked chicken breast or thin sliced steak cut up and made for tacos or something.  I'd get sick of it so I'd just go out to eat, which made my confidence in the kitchen even worse because I never learned how to cook more.   With the sous vide I can pick up whatever meat is cheap at the grocery and some kale or whatever and make a quick meat + salad thing that tastes great with minimal effort.  Not having to babysit the meat means I can spend more time learning how to make better sides, which has made me more interested in cooking and much more willing to host people, cook for my girlfriend etc.   Again I do 100% agree that if I had more resources (a grill would be a very nice start) I'd use my anova less.

In fact it stays on my counter-top and I have to remember to change the water and clean it every now and again. I recommend it for meats especially. If you put a leftover steak in a microwave it is going to over cook it. If you put the steak in the sous vide at the temp you cooked it at originally it will get warmed up to that point and no further. You will lose a little of he crust of the sear because it is mingling around with the moisture inside the bag. I've used it for pasta with sauce, fish, brisket, pulled pork, shrimp and grits, boudin, rice, chili, sausage, and on and on with fantastic results.

Doesn't mean American immersion circulators are not great (they probably are), it's just that Sous Vide Supreme has local representation in almost every European country."

sousvide,3c8enj,Ekaros,2,Mon Jul 6 11:42:32 2015 UTC,Buy it from Canada or USA as most if not all Sous Vide machines use heating elements that are voltage specific. As such you need to have right version 240V or 120V. As such you need one with 120V
sousvide,3c8enj,ThePignTheBread,2,Mon Jul 6 12:01:20 2015 UTC,"If you live in Canada, you should definitely go with the Anova. It is significantly cheaper than the Sous Vide Supreme and from every cook I know who has tried both, they've said the Anova is a top appliance. Also, as another commenter pointed out, European electric voltage is different and while there are converters, it's much better to buy something native to your grid rather than risk malfunction with extra plugs."

sousvide,3c7dxk,bigdaddybodiddly,2,Mon Jul 6 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"One tip for these bags that I can offer is to preheat your sealing strip on your FoodSaver by hitting the seal function before you put your bag in there. The Weston bags take a little extra heat and if you're only sealing one bag, the first one might not seal good enough in one shot."
sousvide,3c7dxk,BornAgainNewsTroll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:47 2015 UTC,That's great feedback!  I like that they're pre-done bags so I don't have to deal with cutting and everything.

He knew they were bad, but we still gnawed and chewed.  Short ribs are tough!  These were fork tender. You didn't need a knife to cut it. I was amazed by the results.   The Chef Steps recipe likens the results to turning a sow's ear into a silk purse. I definitely agree!   If you've never tried it before I'd recommend it.   It's a real ""set it and forget it"" kinda meal, with haute cuisine results.   I had my butcher cut them thick so I could just use the thick strip of meat to slice.   http://imgur.com/l5XYuqH"

sousvide,3c5qqc,0xE6,3,Sun Jul 5 01:54:41 2015 UTC,I've had this happen with my foodsaver. The only thing I can come up with is that the heating element that seals the bag is building up heat after 2-3 bags and causes a seal (non-permanent) on a bag as soon as the lid is closed preventing the vacuum from working.   If I give it 1-2 min with the lid up it works fine again.
sousvide,3c5qqc,CursingDingo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:19:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah that sounds like it could be it.  Frustrating then, because having to wait a few minutes in between makes it take a lot longer bagging the things. Oh well.  Thanks!"
sousvide,3c5qqc,Funkenjaeger,2,Sun Jul 5 04:31:22 2015 UTC,"This has been my experience as well.  My workaround is to quickly wipe the sealing strip between bags, using a rag dampened with cold water.  It's pretty thin and pretty hot, so it doesn't take too much to suck the heat out of it."

sousvide,3c3u81,holapenguin,6,Sat Jul 4 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Safe, yes. Desirable, no. /u/holapenguin nailed it - with moisture and heat, the wax paper will become rather nasty and give you a nice waxy coating.   I'd also wonder why you're stacking them - put them side-by-side in the bag, or use separate ziploc bags  if you're being frugal - you don't want to put them under vacuum,  just remove the air from the bag. If you put them under full vac, you'll end up with compressed patties. This is a perfect place to use displacement instead of vac.   Sous vide burgers are great, especially to introduce people who are afraid of ""pink"" for safety reasons. I explained how you can pasteurize the burger without overcooking the meat, and converted a few people to prefer a juicy burger with a hard sear over a grey puck."
sousvide,3c3u81,moikederp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"You don't need anything to separate well packed patties. A few weeks ago I made 28 burgers (in ~1 hour) at a company party, and stacked them 3x2 in each large Ziploc bag without any separator. They separate easily and intact when done.    Use a burger press to get perfect uniform patties that keep intact throughout the entire cooking process.    Reddit doesn't like it at all, but I cook them at 50C for 20 minutes, and then sear them for 60 seconds on each side on an extremely hot grill pan for juicy and pink burgers with nice dark exterior.

sousvide,3bz8if,Gtmatt22,2,Fri Jul 3 18:09:03 2015 UTC,Yes you are mistaken.  Flank steak will be quite chewy with a shorter cook.  It is a tougher cut that needs a longer cook time.

I download them in epub and use calibre to pull off the DRM and add it to my library. I purchase a lot of them but definitely fill in the gaps of stuff I want to check out but wouldn't buy by using my library.   Some of my Personal Favorites:   Tartine - This is my first stop when I visit San Francisco (Okay, second, third and fourth stop sometimes too) The gingerbread cookies in their book are the best I've ever had. Period. All three books are good but their first is my favorite.  Flour + Water = Awesome book, restaurant is superb. The ravioli with the triple creme brie and green garlic is game stellar and so easy.  Mission Street Food = The Pork Belly!! Also Mission Chinese is putting out their cookbook in October. If you haven't been to their restaurant GO GO GO!  Manresa = Pork Belly with Green tomato (I'm a sucker for Pork Belly) Again, a dining experience if you can make it there. Los Gatos is deep from San Francisco but worth the trip.  Pok Pok - Local to me so I never make anything but it's down the street so I eat there often.    Checked out Alexander Gauthier's what a huge disappointment that book was. The photography is great but it's all printed on flat matte paper. Recipes are each only about a paragraph. I ended up returning that one.   Super jealous of the el Bulli books!!   EDIT: Also, I've been to Mirimoto in Mexico City (again, Pork belly!)"

To get the air out, I submerge the bag under water so the pressure pushes the air out. It works great.

sousvide,3bwxav,greygringo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. The one I'm doing now was dry-brined and then pre-seared (first time I try a pre-sear, vacuuming it was a huge pain because of the juices it was emitting). It's in the water now at 130°F/54°C. Do you think that's maybe too low to get it tender? I strongly prefer rare meat, but only if it's properly tender."
sousvide,3bwxav,greygringo,2,Thu Jul 2 21:05:54 2015 UTC,That temp is fine. Slice it thinly across the grain of the meat and it'll be fine.  Lean cuts get mushy if they're cooked too long.

sousvide,3bsgzq,jermudgeon,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'm underqualified to fully answer, but salting beef before long cooks gives it a sort of cured texture. Generally not what we're going for, but can be interesting."

Meat benefits from precision, while often being forgiving because it's so delicious.

sousvide,3bsgzq,jemminger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:05:06 2015 UTC,"To hop onto this question, what is the purpose of salting the meat during the cook?"
sousvide,3bsgzq,jermudgeon,2,Thu Jul 2 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"Salt has two primary functions. Firstly, it enables us to taste the food better (for instance, http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/09/why-salt-enhances-flavor/ ). Adding salt prior to cooking enables the salt to be spread throughout the meat rather than just on the surface, in a sauce, for instance, or sprinkled on at the table.  Salting during the cook may have little effect for large cuts — a roast, for instance, may be so large that no salt penetrates to the middle during cooking. Consequently, with larger cuts pre-brining or injection are popular methods to get salt right in to the middle.  The second function is one of tenderization and water retention. Salt begins a process of breaking apart protein bonds, preventing the meat from shrinking quite so much when heat is applied. The shrinking is what drives out water; ergo, less shrinking, more juice retained.  I find that in practice, using the right amount of salt in cooking actually lowers the amount of salt necessary to make the food savory. This may have health benefits. This requires precision and planning, however, as there are many types of dishes where it's too easy to concentrate salt beyond what is pleasant — think sauces and broths, when water is removed by evaporation. There are no practical ways to remove salt other than to dilute the dish with water or other ingredients."
sousvide,3bsgzq,bc2zb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"The Food Lab addresses this question in their guide to sous vide steaks. Relevant part from the article:   Q: When should I season my steak?  Seasoning a steak prior to vacuum sealing it and then letting it rest in the bag can result in meat that has a firm texture similar to a mildly cured ham. Some folks find this texture off-putting, though I personally don't mind it. To avoid this texture, it's best to season and bag a steak immediately before cooking, or after cooking sous-vide and before searing.  In either case, only the exterior of a steak will be seasoned, so it's always a good idea to serve your steak with coarse sea salt, such as Maldon, for sprinkling at the table as your guests slice."
sousvide,3bsgzq,IamBetterThanMe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:29:40 2015 UTC,"You can season your meat with whatever you want, But don't salt your meat before. It will turn your meat to a hammy texture, which we don't like normally with steaks."

It is hard to over cook at that point and will be much better than any served at your local Mexican restaurant.  I usually cook it until just light pink and toss in the previously sauteed green peppers and onions. I usually give them a light dusting of seasoning too.    Easy meal during the week.

For just two hours, the meat will be cooked, but won't be analogous of what sous vide can do.  If you can, definitely aim for 8+ hours, as the connective tissue definitely has broken down to the point where the cut of meat went from inexpensive feeling to something much more expensive."

sousvide,3br67h,rmm989,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"I would buy a new circulator for the time being, either Anova or Poly, and depending where you live and work, there will probably be stores that sell used kitchen appliances. Most of them (especially ones owned by Asians) take care of small repairs: induction burners, scales and other electronic appliances like circulators would cost a fraction of the price any ""reputable and authorized"" repair services would charge. Some offer warranty too.  PS Eh eh eh.....86.....only a real cook would use 86."
sousvide,3br67h,ivanbeacco,0,Wed Jul 1 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Considering you can get an Anova for less than 200$, I doubt it is worth repairing an old unit at this point with as economical as they have become."
sousvide,3br67h,axxidental,3,Wed Jul 1 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"yeah, but the anova that's less than 200 is a consumer device, the pro model is $400. Still a bargain compared to the original polyscience."

sousvide,3bnqmo,kamakaro,2,Tue Jun 30 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"Chewy like calamari but not tough.  I tend to google whatever I am trying to cook so in this case ""octopus sous vide"" and then read as many recipes as I can find and then pretty much cook it at the average temp and times listed.  If its too tough keep cooking.  If its too soft cook less time.  If it still sucks stick it in the pressure cooker and make stew.  HAHHA"
sousvide,3bnqmo,abedmcnulty,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's awesome. Design and UI aside how do you DIY units measure up the Anovas?
sousvide,3bnqmo,abedmcnulty,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"the DIY units get shit done!    With a strong enough pump you wont have any hot spots.  Its accurate to within 0.1 degree.    The only issue is trusting the device and engineering it for safety and reliability.  If you get a pump that can withstand boiling temps, add the heat sink like I did, get safe strong heaters, and rig up something to cover the heaters youll end up spending a bit more... then you run terribly close to the same price as an Anova when they are on sale.  So why build something thats still going to be a bit inferior?  I think the DIY sous vide plans made available on the internet are what sparked some people to start the kickstarters for nomiku, Anonva, Sansaire.  They saw that a unit could be built for well under 100$  and compete with Polyscience units at then $800 for their cheapest units.  Polysience has then made cheaper home units but they are still twice as much as the kickstarted devices."

sousvide,3bnqmo,zductiv,2,Tue Jun 30 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"Nice work.  I recently bought the Precision Cooker on sale since I'd have to be replacing some parts in the DIY unit again.   What heating element is that?  The problem I always had with the DIY was trying to find a good food-safe pump that worked at high temperature.  Lightobject offers one but it can't actually be submerged at high temperature, so it has to be put inline and primed, and the flow is pretty low."
sousvide,3bnqmo,zductiv,2,Tue Jun 30 21:07:20 2015 UTC,I have been meaning to try aquarium air bubblers to try and eliminate hot spots but since Ive gotten the real deal circulators I havent really futzed with the DIY ones.  Oops edit... the heating elements were found on ebay by searching immersion heater or graden heater.  Some are 220v so keep that in mind.  If you use one of those in the states they will only run at 1/4 stated wattage.
sousvide,3bnqmo,bigpeepz,2,Tue Jun 30 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Heh yeah, was just curious, actually those 3 shitty Norpro heaters have held up for years on mine, it's the relay that is finally starting to go now since I never heat-sinked it.  Either way, now that I have the Anova I'm with you, no more messing around on the DIY side.  Was a great project though and I learned a lot.  However, the things you can do at a commercial scale (in terms of form factor by custom injection molding, using chips rather than an integrated PID, etc.) mean you can get much higher quality for less money."

I don't imagine I'll have any for a while and if I do hopefully I'll be able to repair the unit with replacement parts.  Love this thing it's a horse and at 83 lbs heavy like one too.  Get one. after 2000 bags you will have spent the same amount versus foods aver bags.... And that's if you buy premade cheap food saver bags off eBay and not rolls.  Rolls I think is about 1000 seals.
sousvide,3bnqmo,thatashguy,2,Wed Jul 1 05:40:56 2015 UTC,I have the 215. Haven't had it for long just wanted to see if there were any surprises coming up with it.  Unfortunately the bags aren't quite as cheap as I'd like because shipping is horrible here (Aus) and ends up costing more than the price of the bags from memory.

sousvide,3bnaqp,gamer0808,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"Not really,  I just found a cheap rectangular cooler.  Used a 2-3/4 hole-saw to cut out the round part of the clamp.  Then traced out the arm and cut it with a jigsaw.  I needed to do some filing on the bottom side of the lid to allow enough room for the it to open and close with the clamp attached.  It's just an air insulator (like I said, cheap cooler) so when I cut the hole, it left a big gap between the top and bottom skins of the lid.  I sprayed some Great Stuff foam insulator in the gap to close it off.  After it dried, I just cut off the excess with a razor knife.  Last, I put on a small aluminum plate to disperse the force of the clamp (again, cheap cooler).  I attached it with some counter-sunk screws and glue.  The hardest part was measuring for the hole saw placement.  There's not a good reference on any part of the cooler, so I ended up just eyeballing it.  I figured I could file it down if I was off a little."

sousvide,3bq1vs,icecow,2,Wed Jul 1 05:54:41 2015 UTC,"Tri-tip is great for SV, as it is usually fatty and has some connective tissue.  But your temperatures are way too high unless you want well done meat.  I have had good results at 130 for 2-4 hours.  That results in a perfectly rare to med-rare steak.  Others will tell you that's too low, but don't listen.  Works great as long as you leave it in at least 2 hours.  No need to cut it into smaller pieces before going in the water - it's easier to cut after it's cooked anyway."
sousvide,3bq1vs,wallsbecametheworld,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:09:26 2015 UTC,"But if this 'braising' type of cut doesn't get to 170F-ish, the cologen doesn't break down into gelatin, which I'd think would give it some succulence (though also more of a shred-y texture).  If it's strictly done at 130F doesn't it have more of a corned beef texture?  Do I have this right?  That said I probably will make my first attempt at 133F or so for 2-3 hours.  I'd think that would at least let me 'bridge' towards the original recipe."
sousvide,3bq1vs,wallsbecametheworld,2,Wed Jul 1 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"No, the connective tissue breaks down just fine at 130.  It comes out very soft (but not mushy)."

Anyway, I thought that the extra time would have no effect on texture, and it made my wife happy, so win-win.   I seared it for about 30 seconds per side, on a hot cast iron pan.  Because it was very thick, i actually seared all 4 sides.   As for the rub, I used a Moroccan rub, consisting of a mix of  1 tbsp each of cumin and coriander 1.5 tbsp each of sugar and paprika 2 tsp salt 1 tsp each of cardamom, cinnamon, ground clove, ground nutmeg and cayenne pepper."

I cook them quite rare, I think 51.6c then sear in a very hot pan while blowtorching the side that won't get contact with the pan. I season post bath.  Rack of lamb is fucking phenomenal if done well."
sousvide,3bohll,CharlesPoliquin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"IMO, I have found the results from sous vide lamb rack underwhelming. I think it might fall into the category of meats that don't benefit from it. I prefer searing it in a pan and roasting it at a high temperature oven versus sous vide manly for crust and fat rendering purposes. Lamb fat is really not my thing.  That being said, I have made lamb rack sous vide a few times and its insanely evenly cooked perfect med rare and super tasty and is by no means a bad way of cooking it. It is just not as good as the traditional method imo if you have that dialed in, which to be honest isn't always super easy."
sousvide,3bmzrk,Redbeastmage,3,Tue Jun 30 15:03:39 2015 UTC,Put one in for 24 hours and another in for 2 and compare.
sousvide,3bmzrk,montani,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:56 2015 UTC,word.  go by your own mouth and preference.  I have tried cooking things at all sorts of different temps and times and have come to the conclusion that some of these time/temp charts are best guesses.      For example you cook something for 16 hours and it feels and tastes great so you tell everyone the recipe... but it turns out you really only need 12 hours for the exact same texture or 8 hours if you bump the temp up 5 degrees.  Thats why you gotta play around.  For me I go for the minimum time it takes to acheive the results i want while not overcooking.
sousvide,3bmzrk,KimcheeBreath,2,Tue Jun 30 16:34:06 2015 UTC,Anything under 24 hrs is going to be really tough due to all the connective tissue.   Try 24-36 hrs at whatever temp you like.  The last one I did was 36 and it came out nice and tender.   Not as much beef flavor as I like in my steak but that's because of the type of cut it is.
sousvide,3bmzrk,layzzzee8,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"This is what I recommend for chuck steak, 24-36 hrs at 55c for a good medium rare. In my opinion chef steps' temperatures are too high, especially if you follow their tough cuts range. This temp is low, but still high enough to properly pasteurise the meat."
sousvide,3bmzrk,RiftingFlotsam,2,Wed Jul 1 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"Just did a couple last week!   did 2 at different times:  ~24 hrs and ~38 hrs  Overall I liked the 24 hr one better.  More steak-y in texture.  The 40 hour one was almost like a pot roast.  Still good, but just different.  I think it also depends on how thick your steaks are, as well as which part of the chuck roll you have.  Some areas have more connective tissues than others."
sousvide,3bmzrk,prepper_of_doom,2,Thu Jul 2 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"I did a chuck steak a weekend or two ago.  I did 130, half for 24 hours and the other for 48 hours. I can't speak to the short time, but the 24 hour version did come out better in my opinion.  It was 'steaky' versus the 48 hour one being more 'roast beefy'. If that makes any sense."
sousvide,3bmzrk,XenoRyet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"Chuck steaks typically include two different major muscles. One is more tender (chuck eye, the continuation of the main muscle of the ribeye), and one is more tough. Since you have a few steaks you might want to separate these muscles to cook them differently.    See this page for info on the chuck eye. That smaller section is quite tender and works well with a shorter cook time.  The larger section does better with longer cook time."
sousvide,3bnbgr,Ikeelu,3,Tue Jun 30 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"I suspect that A) you won't get the right texture for jam, which also involves boiling off water to thicken, and B) it won't be sterile enough to be shelf-stable.   That said, it will most likely be delicious, but more like a compote."

sousvide,3bnscb,gts1117,2,Tue Jun 30 18:26:32 2015 UTC,I have an Anova One and a Sansaire. Very similar units in terms of function. The Sansaire is a little quieter and the clip is really quick to attach to the pan. I like the ability to shift between F and C on the fly but going from a low to a high temp involves a lot of wheel spinning.   The Anova's screen is great for showing a lot of info all the time. I like that it will show actual and set temp simultaneously and I like the built-in timer. I also like the ability to redirect the outlet on the circulator.   Either device is great and will serve you well. I've heard instances of both failing and of both companies coming through with replacements.   I'm not sure if you can get the Anova One any more but I imagine the Precision Cooker is probably pretty good. It's got a less powerful heating element though and I'm not sure if Bluetooth control is anything more than hype.
sousvide,3bnscb,phbarnhart,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"I have been using both a Sansaire (since Feb 2014) and an Anova Precision Cooker (since Feb 2015). They're pretty much the same; the biggest difference is in size. The Anova Precision Cooker is smaller than the Sansaire, and this makes a big difference if you're cooking using a small pot.  I just cooked 30 burger patties in a 5L foam box (31cm depth), and was going to use the Anova, but it required more water due to it being attached to the lip of the box. I ended up using the Sansaire, which I could rest at the bottom of the box after removing the clip.  I haven't experienced any problems with the less powerful heating element on the Anova. I've also had no issues with reliability on either product, and have had no need to contact them.  My go-to for regular use is the Anova. When I'm cooking in larger quantities, I'd rather use the Sansaire, but that's because of the box I use. YMMV, of course."

About once a month I run my circulator at 140ºF for an hour in acidulated water (hefty splash of vinegar) to descale the heating element. I'm working with the prototype precision unit. My production unit is just sitting in the box until I have space to set up a second water bath.

Can't fault the company though, they shipped out a replacement almost straightaway, including international delivery charges!"
sousvide,3bnrdt,Amiibro__for_you__,4,Tue Jun 30 18:19:55 2015 UTC,I'm a little disappointed with my searzall.  I've used it approximately 6 times and the screen is already deformed with a hole in it. Come to find out replacement screens are $30.  I think it's going on eBay.
sousvide,3bnrdt,JimJalinsky,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"did you do the break in? and are you using the propane camping cans?   I got one recently and only have used it once to sear a pork tenderloin. It gave it nice color, but not a nice crust. I think I may need more practice with it. Other than that one sear I've used it to melt cheese on bread while toasting the bread on the bbq."

sousvide,3bjwke,Mindflux,2,Mon Jun 29 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"This is the model I think folks should get. Any of the newer ""automatic"" models don't work as well - they're harder to get going and control the seal if you have liquid in the bag. And this model has the roll cutter which makes bags much more economical than premade bags.  The only thing I'm not happy is that they've replaced the jar sealer with the bag vacuum."
sousvide,3bjwke,tsdguy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:24:43 2015 UTC,This is the one I like because you can lock the lid down. Mine is older and I have to hold the lid down until it starts to seal and I can let go. But occasionally it will lose the seal when I let go. I just want to lock it and let it rip.
sousvide,3bjwke,tsdguy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:15:07 2015 UTC,Yea. Your kind is the one that doesn't work very well. I have an older model with a locking lever and I wouldn't use any other kind.

sousvide,3bjwke,tsdguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:07:27 2015 UTC,The one advantage to that change is that the jar sealer is easy to find. I wanted a bag vacuum -- my unit is from before they created the bags -- and no one but Foodsaver seems to stock it.
sousvide,3bjwke,father87,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:56:10 2015 UTC,That's true. And I'm wondering how well the ported plastic bags work for longer sous vide. They could be a nice update from using the displacement method and standard bags - that gets tedious.

sousvide,3bjdgo,pensotroppo,7,Mon Jun 29 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"2 issues:    If the contents of the jar is not liquidy, then the heat from the water bath will not conduct as well because air is a relatively poor conductor.  If your jar is not completely full, it may float. This may cause issues where parts of the jar is not submerged, causing problems with heating the inside thoroughly"
sousvide,3bjdgo,g0ing_postal,3,Mon Jun 29 20:31:09 2015 UTC,"I've done a number of desserts (creme brulee) as well as messed with precision steeping of tea using my sous vide and mason jars. I've done the garlic confit in a mason jar in the sous vide as well.  I also home can and a lot of it is the same stuff. You can crack a jar when you introduce a cold jar to hot water - when we home process stuff you heat the jar (as well as sterilize it, but that's needed for sous vide). You could also add the jar before the sousvide water is up to temperature.  If you submerge, you'll need to be sure to use finger-tip tight on the rings or it'll leak.  I also found when I was doing the tea that the jar took like 30 minutes to get up to temperature inside. You might need to adjust your recipes to compensate that worked for you using bags.   Finally, I had some issues keeping jars upright and water level. If I wasn't submerging something, you still need the water level higher than whats in the jar - but also not get inside the jar, and enough stuff in the jar so it doesn't fall over. A smaller sousvide container is best here."

sousvide,3bjdgo,amlyfe,3,Mon Jun 29 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"Just a tip from someone who cans a lot, I would probably use similar canning practices like wiping rims, making sure there's some headspace and that the bands are just finger tight. Though wiping the rims may not be that important since you're not trying for a seal."
sousvide,3bjdgo,Bachstar,2,Mon Jun 29 20:20:09 2015 UTC,I've used mason jars to infuse vodka & rum with flavors and have never run into any issues with cracking the glass or leaked seals.  I usually put the jar in before the water reaches it's full temp though.

sousvide,3bjdgo,Bachstar,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite to date was a spiced pear vodka that I made with a couple overripe pears, a cinnamon stick, about 8-10 cloves, a little bit of candied ginger and half a vanilla bean.  Stuck all that in a mason jar and then covered it with vodka.  Put it in the sous vide for 2 hours at 130F.    It came out this luscious almost caramel-like spiced fruit concoction. I mixed some of it into cocktails with ginger liqueur, which was tasty, but my favorite was actually just pouring it over ice and then sipping it.  And the pears were also quite yummy over ice cream!"
sousvide,3bjdgo,Canadian_Club,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:53:15 2015 UTC,8-10 cloves? How pronounced was the clove flavor? It sounds good.
sousvide,3bjdgo,Bachstar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't find it overly clove-y, but I do like cloves quite a bit.  You might start with half that and then add more if you like it."

sousvide,3bjdgo,Jungies,2,Mon Jun 29 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think the heat transfer is a little slower through glass than thin plastic, so watch your core temperature gradient, particularly with thick jars.   I've used non-mason canning jars for sous vide Dulche de Leche at 85c successfully, so they'll handle the heat and being submerged."

sousvide,3bjdgo,Ikeelu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"If you do use mason jars, screw the lids on a little bit past finger tight.  Then back off and unscrew till it's loose, and lid on again till it's very lightly finger tight.  This will allow any pressure that builds up escape.  I'm not sure at what temperature this becomes important."
sousvide,3bjdgo,Nosterana,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"I've been using mason jars a lot lately. I SV a lot of alcohol, have done creme brulee, and will probably try making a apricot jam today too. One thing to note is if its not filled enough it will float, but dont overfill it either or you can blow up a jar. Luckily I didn't have this happen to any of my infusions, just one 4oz jar of creme brulee which blew the bottom of the jar clean off after transfering it to a ice bath. Leave maybe a 1/2"" to 3/4"" from the top so it can expand if needed."
