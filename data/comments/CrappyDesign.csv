CrappyDesign,3dy3zi,JustToViewPorn,5,Mon Jul 20 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"It's not really a matter of viewpoints rather basic psychology. In situations with ambiguity such as in this, your brain can be manipulated quite easily to see one or another.  In this case your brain is naturally inclined to fill in the letters I and C due to the context (as in Kick). However the title of the post primes you to increase the chances that you see KKK. I can almost guarantee that if the title wasn't there you would have read it as Kick.  If you want further evidence on this, there is a chapter dedicated to ambiguity in the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahnemn. There is an example almost exactly like this one which shows exactly how context affects ambiguity."

CrappyDesign,3dtvmw,GeeJo,28,Sun Jul 19 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: this tradition can be traced back to Edward VII who, after succeeding Victoria to the throne of the UK, ended up becoming so corpulent that he couldn't comfortably use the bottom buttons on his jackets. ""Black tie"" get-ups were also popularised on his account, replacing the older more formal white-tie suits.  He also had dozens of confirmed mistresses, organised the royal equivalent of ""key parties"" for entertainment, and while still Prince of Wales was forced to appear as a witness in court twice - once for cuckolding a Member of Parliament, and another time for being part of an illegal gambling ring.  Bertie's one of my favourite Royals from the past century or two, and unfairly forgotten by history."
CrappyDesign,3dtvmw,theunnoanprojec,11,Sun Jul 19 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"To be fair to him being forgotten, that's because during George v's reign right after his, WWI and the great depression happened, then the Edward viii/George VI stuff happened after that.

It wasn't a general ad. I had no problem understanding it.  Why is it in a magazine that looks to be something like home and gardens?

CrappyDesign,3dz7uu,PmMeForPCBuilds,6,Mon Jul 20 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"According to the World Book encyclopedia, U was adopted from the Greek letter Y. The Romans dropped the bottom stroke and wrote the letter as V. This was used for both the consonant sound V and the vowel sound U. Some time around 900 A.D. people began to use V at the beginning of a word and U in the middle of a word. It was during the time between 1400 A.D. and 1600 A.D. that U became the letter commonly used for the vowel sound.   There was a Renaissance of the Classical style of architecture in the United States from 1890-1940. William R. Ware, the founder of M.I.T.'s School of Architecture, taught a style that he called American Vignola. (Vignola was an Italian architect who codified the standards for Classical Architecture in his work Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture). We own a reprint of Ware's primer American Vignola (729.3 Ware).   In the early 1900's, it was common for educated men to be taught both Greek and Latin. Therefore the people involved with the design of this building and many others during this American Renaissance more than likely would have known the Classic Roman alphabet used the symbol V for both U and V."

As soon as you press a comment, you get immediate controls to up/downmod, reply, and copy the URL, along with hide and ""go to parent"" shortcuts. If you click the menu, you get even more advanced options for looking at the poster's profile and other options.

I think when I first used it before it was the official app it was pretty easy to navigate and simple but still packed with features. The update essentially got the app and gave it a hearty shake, so things aren't where they make sense.  However, I use the old-school UI which is actually far more useful and ergonomic than the new one."
CrappyDesign,3dp4v3,AnOldPhilosopher,4,Sat Jul 18 15:36:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. When I had an iPod, I exclusively used Alien Blue. Even paid to support the dev, and I liked the gallery view when you have the pro (?) version.  Unfortunately, there isn't really the same functionality in RiF.

I bought an iPad mini last year because I loved using Alien Blue. Little did I know, the iPad version has been basically abandoned since they were bought out by Reddit. It's buggy as hell, and they haven't even put in native support for html5 video yet. The only update I've seen them make since I got my iPad was to add sponsored ads into the posts. Ads! In an application that I paid $6 for!  I just wish there was a version of Sync for iPad. Much better app."

The capsizing boat is right next to an iceberg, so it's pretty obviously a reference to the sinking of the Titanic, the 1997 film about which is still the second-highest-grossing of all time behind Avatar.    So yeah, it's an ad for an app that somehow helps you book events like film screenings, and it's referencing a popular and classic film in a whimsical way.    Final verdict: not crappy."

Technically it's an XML version of a blog or news site. When blogs became popular way back when, people started using ""RSS reader"" apps that could pull in all the RSS feeds you gave it, and present it all in a unified format, in the format you want - similar to how email programs presented incoming email. This avoids having to manually visit 20 different blogs / news sites constantly.  Reddit supports RSS; here's the front page in RSS form: http://www.reddit.com/.rss  edit: words"

CrappyDesign,3dlqse,FlipStik,4,Fri Jul 17 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The best thing about RSS IMO is that you can get content from tons of sites, all within a single RSS app of your choice, and bypass 99% of the shitty formatting, ads, etc. of the sites.    And the reader keeps track of which stories you've read or are new, etc...  As someone mentioned elsewhere, the ""heyday"" of RSS has passed, but it's still out there and is still useful IMO."

Here's what it looks like on Digg Reader, a web-based RSS client. On the left is the list of sites I'm subscribed to. Bold names have unread articles, and the number tells you how many. On the right is a stream of all unread content from Clickhole, the site currently selected. You get a summary (the RSS excerpt) of each new article/post/story/whatever and click through if you want to read it. As you scroll down the list the items are marked as read."

CrappyDesign,3dlqse,quaybored,6,Fri Jul 17 13:53:56 2015 UTC,"RSS is a way that web sites can export their content to specialized readers that compile the content of many sites and provide one place to consume them.  Frequently, each article can be read marked as read, so one never sees the same article repeatedly.  In addition to that, most RSS readers offer categorization (e.g. I only want to read articles about technology) and some offer search of all the articles in your library."
CrappyDesign,3dlqse,strcrssd,2,Sat Jul 18 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"ELI5, because I don't know exactly how it works, but it stands for ""Really Simple Syndication"", and it's basically for updating you when something happens on a website. Like, I use it for when online games I play are updated, so I check my RSS feeds every now and again to see what's new instead of checking 5 websites individually. This actually works with reddit too. I don't use it for anything, but if you add .rss to the end of any URL on reddit, you can be notified when that page updates, which is handy if you enjoy posts from certain users. For example, https://www.reddit.com/user/Silvermouse5150/submitted.rss would allow someone to be updated when you post something new to reddit."

CrappyDesign,3doj1s,doctorwaiter,10,Fri Jul 17 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"Nope... Brilliant Design  from answers.com:   When the U.S. started issuing coins in the 1790s, by law a coin had to contain metal whose value was the same as its denomination minus a small amount to cover minting costs. That meant coins had to contain different amounts of metal, or different metals altogether. Cents were large, about the size of a half-dollar, because they had to contain about 0.98¢ worth of copper. Similarly a dime had to contain about 9.9¢ of silver, etc. etc. That meant that coins made from the same metal were sized in proportion: a quarter was 2.5X the size of a dime, a half dollar was 5X the size, etc. It's also the reason that a dime is smaller than a nickel or a penny, because silver was more valuable than copper or nickel.   Eventually by the 1960s silver was completely eliminated. However, by that time there were so many vending machines and coin-counters that it would have been extremely disruptive to change sizes again, so coins were kept the same size as before. The new dollar coins were the only exception because there were no machines that took the old coins; the Mint was able to downsize that denomination without forcing major retrofits.   Also note that the edges vary... this allows Blind people to easily identify the coins by combination of size and edge."

CrappyDesign,3dite6,Bandin03,7,Thu Jul 16 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"Explanation:  This yellow piece of plastic houses two fuses. If you pull up on it, it pulls both fuses out of their slots but then locks so you can’t remove the whole thing. There are no places to squeeze or unclip, it needs a special tool to remove the whole thing. I was finally able to get it off by sticking a knife in and breaking the clips holding it on. Then after getting it off, the fuses are locked into the damn thing and require another tool to remove those. And because the plastic isn’t clear, you have to do all of this just to even see if either of those fuses is bad. I gave up and cut the damn thing open to get the fuses out. I shouldn’t have to go to a dealership just to check if a fuse is blown.  And for the curious, I looked up the purpose of it. Those two fuses are for dome lights/radio and a few other things that can drain the battery without the car running. That casing lets the manufacturers disconnect the fuses for storage/shipping."

Then they mixed oreos, cheese and fishsticks in it and it was nasty... how's that relevant product testing?  I don't see what's bad about the product really, the shape is weird but it seems great for making omelette style stuff. I might use it if someone gave me one, but I don't identify with their commercial at all - doesn't everyone have teflon (non-stick) pans nowadays? It's super easy."

Plus, cleaning that thing is probably a bitch, not to mention it's a one-trick-pony appliance.  It cooks eggs... that's all it does... I can cook hundreds of things, including eggs, with a frying pan."

I got drawn in by this guy about 6 years ago. Listened to many hours of his show and read the links. He lost me with the way he cherry picked his sources; if it tied in to the big scam he would tout it as proof; if not then it was because the media was in on it.   Also he went way too far as many of you know. How the heck can you agree without being delusional to the extreme?   But part of the reason I was so enraptured by Mr.Watt was that he really does turn up some fascinating information. Look at these pages , the links he provides. There is enough there to stimulate an inquisitive mind for months, and there certainly are conspiracies in the world, it is just a matter of how far you can agree with Mr.Watt and consider yourself rational.   To be fair I think he is a hugely intelligent man, but is hopelessly lost in his own fiction (everything is part of a big plan, there are no coincidences). However there are many intriguing and disturbing truths in his work.   Baby and bathwater, etc...   Finally, yes that design sucks."

CrappyDesign,3dbzkg,Smudgeontheglass,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"Well, this one was 220..240v only.  It seems to me that most electronics devices sold in the US can also work at 240v, but most devices sold in Europe can't also work at 120v. May be because most of the world uses ~230v (between 220 and 240) , so if you make something that works only on 120v that much more severely restricts your ability to sell it elsewhere than if you build it for 220..240 . Desktop power supplies don't frequently go across the Atlantic anyway.  edit: it could simply be that the switch was omitted. Voltage switches like that are expensive because idiots flip it and then if they live in 240v land something blows up and they return the power supply for warranty repair. Internally it's quite simple - the switch turns the rectifier into a voltage doubler - but you need to use two capacitors in place of one to have a switch, and have to deal with the idiots, so I imagine it saves money to make it without a switch. edit2: and wide input range from 100 to 240 may also hurt efficiency a bit."

All of the buildings were around the ""quad"" which was basically an open area surrounded by buildings.  All of the names of the buildings faced away from the quad for some reason.   This means if you didn't know what building you were looking for, you'd have to walk around to the outside of the buildings.  It was the difference between standing in the middle of the quad and rotating and reading the names until you found the one you were looking for and having to go outside and do like a mile loop around the outsides of the buildings looking at the names.  Oh, also, two buildings had the same names.  Mouton Hall and F.G Mouton Hall.   One was two story, one was four story.  At the beginning of every semester, you could go stand on the second floor of the two-story one and watch freshmen frantically run back and fourth looking for the stairs to get to the third or fourth floor."

CrappyDesign,3d30jf,OohKitties,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:39 2015 UTC,I would awkwardly walk the actual path even if I had to go that way every day. This is way too revealing of my personality type.
CrappyDesign,3d30jf,Rachelisasuperhero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"I don't remember where I heard this, and I am not going to look it up.   The Cornell campus did not have paved walkways for the first several years of its existence, just grass. Paths were placed where the grass died.  Buildings have been added since then, but I think the tradition remains."
