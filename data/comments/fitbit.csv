fitbit,3dzdo4,sparcotsi,2,Mon Jul 20 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"I believe when you manually enter the exercise on your dashboard, it fully replaces whatever steps were there so they don't count."
fitbit,3dzdo4,IAmA_Turtl,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:34 2015 UTC,That's what I've read but my issue is more with the Calorie counts.  This mornings training ride read 456 on my 705 computer with a chest strap and my Fitbit read 278 or something like that.  If I go into dashboard can I redefine the exercise and the calories?  I hadn't tried it yet I just figured if I can throw it in my bag and not have it read anything that's just as easy for me.
fitbit,3dzdo4,IAmA_Turtl,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I haven't tried throwing it in a bag, but that shouldn't affect the calorie counts. When you manually input the ride fitbit will still use their own equation for that, which may or may not be the same as your 705's count. I'm not sure if you can change it or not.   My suggestion would be to import your data from the 705 to fitbit directly. For example, I have strava and fitbit linked. I record my rides with strava and then they show up with the same calorie counts on fitbit as a new activity automatically. I haven't used a biking computer before so I'm not 100% on this, but your 705 should have some way to output it's data, especially to something like strava where you can have it automatically linked to fitbit. It's not a perfect system, but it has worked for me so far."
fitbit,3dzdo4,IAmA_Turtl,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"Alright I rode home today with my fitbit recording the activity and my 705.  Again even with heart capabilities it was almost 100 calories lower.  When I try to edit my workout to change it from ""workout"" to cycling I can't seem to change anything.  I deleted the workout record and logged my own so the calories are correct however now I'm still +2521 steps that I didn't actually take."
fitbit,3dzdo4,Doceng,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:29 2015 UTC,"I believe fitbit estimates how many steps it takes when you put in the biking activity so that could be it but I honestly haven't looked into it to much so I'm not sure. In my experience I seem to get way less steps then I deserve. I generally get around 2500 to 3000 steps for an hours ride even though walking casually for an hour would give me way more and the ride was much more intense than walking. If you're looking to get no steps then certainly try the bag thing, it might work although I expect you'd rack up at least a few on bumpier sections of your ride.  Sorry I'm not more help, fitbit wasn't designed for cyclists so it seems at the moment you just have to deal as best as possible and figure out what works for you. I'm not big on competing so I tend to focus more on the amount of activity in the day rather then steps since I can accurately log my biking time."
fitbit,3dzm93,Inhumanskills,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"FitBit has great customer service. I know people outside of warranty who have their products replaced entirely free for issues like this. I've been wearing my HR daily for six months and it doesn't have any wear on it whatsoever, so I wouldn't worry about it.   Additionally I'm getting about 3 days of battery life with what I assume to be medium to high use is that normal? I know it's advertised as 5 days of battery life but that might be with the HR feature disabled.   Definitely not normal. I have mentioned this a few times in this subreddit, but last week I emailed FitBit about the 3-4 day battery life I was getting out of my FitBit, they took a look at my account and saw how quickly my FitBit was draining its battery and sent me a replacement free of charge - didn't even have to send my old one back."

Regarding the battery my friend also bought one from BestBuy and her battery was completely empty when she tried turning it on for the first time. While mine was low but still enough to turn on and update. I'm guessing the BestBuy stock is not always the ""freshest"" so you might be getting a device that's been sitting there for a while.  I will try to get an exact time for how long the battery lasts. If it's less than 4 days I'm gonna shoot their customer support an email.   Thanks again!"

If you need an XL but only have an L, might be worth exchanging it for the appropriate size if possible. The FitBit can cause irritation fast - especially the HR. I wear mine daily - and it fits with a lot of extra room - and I still find that once a week I have to take it off for half a day or so just because it's irritating my skin."

fitbit,3dzkw1,sheldonizer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I aslo have a Charge HR and use MFP and Strava. I use both fitbit and Strava to track my running and cycling.   Prior to the fitbit/Strava integration back in May, I had fitbit connected to MFP and MFP connected to Strava. Strava workouts would import into MFP and then workouts would import from MFP into fitbit. Once the fitbit/Strava integration became available, I connected them and found that workouts were being imported twice. Once directly from Strava to fitbit and once from Strava to MFP then from MFP to fitbit. To avoid this, I disconnect the MFP/Strava integration, so now I only have fitbit connected to MFP and fitbit connected to Strava. I think this connection setup captures everything in all three systems yet prevents most of the redundant data.  While running or cycling I only start a workout on Strava. At the end of the workout, the Strava data will import into fitbit. The fitbit data will then import into MFP.  I have thought about this a lot so am open to other methods or suggestions.  Hope this helps.  Also, one thing I have searched around for yet don't think is available yet is the ability to import heart rate data from fitbit to Strava."

I've also heard that the customer service reps tell people that they're not really actually waterproof.

fitbit,3dxj9f,a_horse_with_no_tail,5,Mon Jul 20 13:28:30 2015 UTC,"Well the internals are pretty poured with plastic, so water cannot get in. The reason they won't tell it's waterproof is because it wasn't designed to withstand these conditions on long basis and that there are some other parts, like a glue which sticks your wristband to the device itself.  So you can pretty much swim in it (did that couple of times, however HR readings in water are just poor, so bad idea), but it would just shorten the life of the device."

fitbit,3dxj9f,elizabethan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:00 2015 UTC,Down to 10M. Which makes swimming harmless.
fitbit,3dxj9f,swiddie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:32 2015 UTC,"Do not swim with your tracker.   This means the trackers can be submerged and will still work when removed from the water. However, this does not mean the trackers can withstand the force associated with swimming strokes, so as mentioned previously we don't recommend swimming with the trackers.   I am so confused why this continues to be a point of confusion on this sub...."

fitbit,3e0nlz,htunstall,3,Tue Jul 21 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"The fitbit bases your calorie burn based on your heart rate during the workout period and your body weight. So if, during your weights session you heart rate is not elevated much it doesn't recognise the amount of calories you are burning.   If you were to increase your body weight on the app then it would recognise the extra exertion and increase your base calorie burn to affect it.  So, lets say you did squats with 100kg for 30 minutes. If you increased your weight on the app for by 100 kg for that time (as an example) you would burn more calories.  The problem is any HRM is not great for calculating calories during weight training. Calorie expenditure is a tricky thing at the best of times and adding the 3rd external force (ie the weight you are moving) adds a complicated layer to the math that the HRM can't compensate for."
fitbit,3e0nlz,fracturedworlds,2,Tue Jul 21 11:22:55 2015 UTC,I experience the same thing.  What is really weird is I 'burn' more calories doing a light walk vs. lifting weights.
fitbit,3e0nlz,HRdiva,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly my evening leisurely walk with my dog burns more!"
fitbit,3dwwvc,iaskquestions12,7,Mon Jul 20 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"It bases it off your heart rate and zones. So, for example, if there is an age difference between you it will calculate your zones differently. If one of you is fitter than the other the same training (IE increasing/decreasing speeds together) will affect your heart rates differently. If you can pop screen grabs of the workout heart rate zones from the app for comparison.   That is the advantage of the Charge HR, it shows you what your actual exertion is rather than your perceived exertion and that will be different for both of you.  Either that or it is too loose/tight on her an not reading the heart rate properly giving an inaccurate reading."
fitbit,3dwwvc,fracturedworlds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"We're about a month apart in age, but I'm definitely in better shape than she is, which is kind of why I'm confused why she has so much less active minutes. Her heart rate is generally much higher than mine when we work out, yet the Fitbit doesn't track it.   We may go try to exchange hers for a large instead of a small, hopefully Walmart lets us exchange it."
fitbit,3dwwvc,Inhumanskills,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:00 2015 UTC,You can manually set the HR zones if you don't think the ones provided by fitbit are accurate.  Go to Account>Settings>HR Zones (All the way at the bottom)   I would go back and track her HR during her exercise and the set the zones to match when she started and stopped working out.  That should fix it for her.
fitbit,3dwwvc,fracturedworlds,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:38 2015 UTC,What is it showing in the app? If she has been into the settings she may have changed her HR zone settings.
fitbit,3dwwvc,cyronius,5,Tue Jul 21 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"With a Charge HR (or Surge) it looks for activity and increased heart rate.  So if your girlfriends heart wasn't as increased as yours, she may not have hit the ""active minute"" amount.  She may simply be fitter than you (or much lighter, and thus requiring less energy to run)"
fitbit,3dwwvc,pogafuisce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:44:33 2015 UTC,"Hm, she's about ~70lbs smaller than I am, but she's not in as good of shape as I am. When we use the elliptical and hold the metal heart rate monitor things, she'll hit 170-180 regularly, same for the treadmill. Her resting heart rate is about 75. Less activity will raise her heart rate much quicker than mine, which was another reason I was confused. Her calories burn is often much less than mine, but I can understand that, because she doesn't have as much extra weight on her body as I do."
fitbit,3dwwvc,psaldorn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"With the Charge HR, they want you to wear it in a specific place, and even recommend a more specific place when engaged in activity like running or treadmill.  Check the instructions, she may not be wearing hers correctly.    For normal wear it should be 1-2 fingers above the wrist bone, for strenuous activity it should be 3 fingers.  Both placements should be snug but not tight."

fitbit,3dwwvc,cyronius,2,Mon Jul 20 06:49:07 2015 UTC,Your reason for not wanting to get one is a more accurate and personalised calorie burn rate?

fitbit,3dwwvc,cyronius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:39 2015 UTC,The OP thought it was inaccurate because it was showing different burn rates for different people.  The OP was wrong...

fitbit,3du8rp,VirtualRealityCzech,9,Sun Jul 19 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"why the FitBit   Mostly because it was the major brand I was hearing about. I wanted an activity tracker and I figured the most popular one was probably the most popular for a reason. I started with a Flex, now have a Charge HR. I've fallen in love with activity trackers in general, and particularly the Fitbits. In research I've done I've used trackers from Fitbit, Garmin, Jawbone, BodyMedia, Polar, and Misfit and other than possibly BodyMedia the FitBit wins in all areas. The BodyMedia data breakdown is more interesting to me, but the device is less comfortable and the general usability is far below a Fitbit, so for consumers I'd still say the Fitbit is best.   did it provide you with motivation?   I provided me with motivation, the Fitbit just allowed me to set quantifiable goals. :) I used to try to always walk an hour a day. Not bad at all, but at my pace and on my path that's only about 7k steps. With normal living that's fine, but with sedentary weekends I could struggle to make 10k. I thought I was being really active but wasn't even hitting minimum recommendations some days! Having a Fitbit didn't make me start walking, but it made me walk further.    Will the FitBit help me become more motivated? I usually am a goal-oriented person and like to race to the finish line in any endeavour. I am also an all-in/all-or-nothing personality type.   You need to want to be active, but if you're a numbers-lover the Fitbit will help you measure the activity you choose to do. I'm also an all-or-nothing person and it actually got me into trouble with my Fitbit a few weeks ago when I thought ""I've never had a 25k day. Oh, hey, there's 25k. You know, I still have a few hours of daylight left. Why not 30k? Oh, hey, 30k. Would be a shame to get this close and not get 35k . . ."" and my knees hurt so much the following days that I couldn't hit my 15k goal. :( lol  So it's a double-edged sword for us numbers + all-or-nothing types. :)   The other question would be, which FitBit?   If you want a SmartWatch too then get a Surge. If you don't want a SmartWatch but want somethign a bit more advanced (readout for time/stats on the device, heart rate monitor, etc.) get a Charge HR. If you just want a basic wristband without a HR monitor or readout get a Flex. If you don't want a wristband get a Zip or One.  I've personally owned a Flex and Charge HR. I prefer the Charge HR, but the battery life is only a few days compared to 1-2 weeks like the Flex, and you can't wear it in the shower like you could with the Flex. On the other hand the sleep tracking is automatic and the heart rate monitor is nice.  It really depends on what features are important to you.  I wrote up an activity tracker post a while back on loseit that might interest you."
fitbit,3du8rp,AtomikRadio,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Superb answer. Also started with Flex, now Charge HR, mostly because I have to wear watch and wearing watch and Flex isn't convinient at all.  Regarding battery life: I always charge my Fitbit when I'm in the bathroom in the morning, so about 10m\day. With that pace both Flex and Charge are always ""mid-charged""."

fitbit,3du8rp,psaldorn,3,Sun Jul 19 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"Aria scales plus a fitbits and disciplined use of calorie tracking has helped me lose a bunch of weight very fast. Badges and graphs add a nice gamification of it. Also started eating soylent to keep me fuller for longer, but just watching/scanning what you eat and planning your day out helps loads. I normally find it very hard to close weight or stay motivated. Good luck!"
fitbit,3du8rp,Respectfullyyours,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:20 2015 UTC,thank you
fitbit,3du8rp,CBML50,3,Sun Jul 19 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"I have the fitbit flex, and yes it's wonderful for motivation. On days where I might otherwise not leave my house, or barely get any exercise because I'm at the library, it gives me the extra push to get out there and make walking a priority. I actually really look forward to getting in my 10k steps now, and use it as a reward for when I finish my work. I just think because it's such a regular thing, and a goal that's do-able, it really helps create a healthy habit, and ends up affecting other parts of your life. I've been eating healthier, tracking my meals with MyFitnessPal (which can be connected to your FitBit), drinking more water, planning out meals ahead of time (which helps as I need to be frugal), etc. It helps motivate me as well because say I get 17k steps in and I think I'm done, I'll check my count and think, I'm really close to 20k, why not do another quick walk? It definitely pushes me more than I'd do otherwise, and I feel like I have a healthier lifestyle because of it."
fitbit,3du8rp,OJ1414,3,Mon Jul 20 04:43:50 2015 UTC,I think it helps keep me motivated. I'm also kind of competitive so I like being at the top of my friends list or winning challenges. It's also a good reminder to get up and move - on the weekends sometimes I can be a bit sluggish so I'll tell myself I have to hit a certain # of steps by noon or whatever.
fitbit,3du8rp,OJ1414,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"For me, I knew I needed to start losing weight and was making progress before I bought the Fitbit. But the Fitbit helps give me a little extra kick—either to get off my ass and workout when I'm having a lazy day, to push myself a little bit harder through a workout or through the competition of challenges. It's a constant reminder on your wrist (I have a Charge HR) that your activity is being monitored and pushes me not to be a lazy bastard (most of the time at least)."
fitbit,3du8rp,neurosciencey,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"how is the durability? i talked to friends who bought a FitBit when they first came out, just the entry level ones and they both broke"

fitbit,3drwvl,daddytorgo,15,Sat Jul 18 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"MyFitnessPal is the general favorite. I use it, and it worked well until recently. Lately I've noticed that it's giving me more calories eaten in the Fitbit app than what is logged in MFP, but since I rely on Fitbit to tell MFP stuff and not the other way around it doesn't bother me. I've asked some people if they had this same issue and they say no, so it could just be a weird food entry for me or something. I'd try MFP."
fitbit,3drwvl,AtomikRadio,3,Sat Jul 18 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"I've had that happen when I delete or update mistakes in MFP, and some how fitbit doesn't get the memo."
fitbit,3drwvl,lowt4,2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:43 2015 UTC,"That makes total sense. I haven't been deleting entire things, but sometimes I go through and, in switching from something like Grams to Cups it will say I had 11,000 Calories of yogurt before I switch the number as well. So that could definitely be the culprit, since it did start happening more when I started measuring more with the scale! Thanks for likely solving the mystery!"
fitbit,3drwvl,AtomikRadio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:39 2015 UTC,Cool - thanks!  Looking forward to diving in and really making this thing work for me.
fitbit,3drwvl,Jennynot,2,Sat Jul 18 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"I second MFP - so useful to get that calorie adjustment in your food diary. MFP also has MUCH better food management (eg recipes) and a more comprehensive database for food than fitbit does, especially if you live in the UK.  I also sync both of these with Withings as I have a wireless scale - so my weight and bodyfat (estimate) updates on all three. I'm not sure if/how you're tracking those metrics but it's nice it's shared."
fitbit,3drwvl,Jennynot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:43:37 2015 UTC,"Cool.   I have an Omni scale that I bought like 4-5 years ago when I did my serious weightloss (262-172). It's not wireless, so it won't be able to sync with mfp/fitbit, but I'll probably just manually input the measurements.   To be honest, I've stopped weighing myself daily for a while now, and stopped really dialing-in on what I've eaten, and part of the desire to get the fitbit was to motivate myself to get back to that.   Not that I've put a ton of weight back on, but just want to be more disciplined."
fitbit,3drwvl,Jennynot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:49 2015 UTC,"Gratz on the weight loss, that's a huge accomplishment. Taking that journey myself and I know how hard it is!   FYI you can enter your weight manually into fitbit/mfp and this will also sync between them as well as everything else!  Really it's what works best for you. Like you said - the fitbit is great motivation to do even a little bit every day (which is a good start for any health improvement :)).   I personally find weighing myself daily keeps my eye on the ball, as I see the consequences of past behaviour (good or bad) immediately. But some people prefer weekly weigh ins etc so it's all good really :)"
fitbit,3drwvl,Jennynot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:03:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  You'll get there - it's all about willpower, and since you're here I'm guessing you have that willpower.   Yep - I used to do daily weigh-ins to hold myself accountable, but it's definitely personal preference. Slacked off on that after maintaining for a while though, and want to just dial-down a little bit."
fitbit,3drwvl,Faitmaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:23 2015 UTC,yeah maintenance is a different beast entirely i'd imagine.  I just can't imagine what it will be like to eat 1600 calories every day ;p Might even have to be more assuming I can get my activity level up consistently.   Got a ways to go for that yet but you know. It will be odd ;)

As soon as I log it as yoga, my active minutes are gone and my calorie burn goes down because according to fitbit, yoga isn't ""active"" and you only burn like 100 calories per hour doing it. (Not!)"
fitbit,3drmsg,idkmybffjll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:43 2015 UTC,Hm. Strange that it changes the stats I think.. Why not just relate to what was actually logged? Would make more sense to me!
fitbit,3drmsg,951jimbo,2,Sun Jul 19 07:11:58 2015 UTC,It asks you the time that you did the activity so that it can compare that activity against the data it collected.  - Mostly its not very useful except if you are riding a bike or something that won't accurately be collected by the fitibit.  It can actually ADD steps or active minutes.  When I go walking it does as it realizes that you can't walk that far with that few steps.  I think its just because I have a long stride???
fitbit,3drmsg,951jimbo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"So would it make any difference if I had logged the walk as an activity in the first place, or would it just log the data it recieved? I think I'll have to test this today by walking the same route, logging it in real time."

fitbit,3ds7gz,ZshadeZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:29:14 2015 UTC,This is the answer. If I don't put the Fitbit on until noon calories will suddenly jump to ~1400 because it doesn't automatically add your BMR calories burned until you put it on and it syncs.
fitbit,3dqzsc,aubgrad11,2,Sat Jul 18 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to know if fitbit just modulates its data based on what you set for the given time period or not. Maybe it disregards steps during that period in favour of the exercise you add?  That data would be very useful with the heart monitoring to get a better idea of calories burnt, I would have thought?"
fitbit,3dqzsc,psaldorn,2,Sat Jul 18 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"That's always been my understanding of how it works.  Wear the band 24/7, log anything interesting you do and fitbit will adjust for it.  Frankly, if that's not how it works then it's not convenient enough to use."

fitbit,3dq0s5,mspinkyy,3,Sat Jul 18 09:21:58 2015 UTC,I charge it everyday day while I shower and since March its been doing fine. It knows to log steps when I push a grocery store cart but I've only checked once so can't say for sure. Have fun with it!
fitbit,3dq0s5,blckcoffeenosugar,3,Sat Jul 18 11:02:15 2015 UTC,"With regards to counting steps when pushing a cart or stroller, it depends on which one you have.I have the Surge and my fiance has the charge HR and neither of our trackers count steps when pushing a cart. However when I had my FitBit One, that didn't have any issues because it was in my pocket so steps weren't a problem. I either have to push the cart with one hand or put the my Surge in my pocket for it to kind of count steps. It doesn't count really slow steps it seems when it is in my pocket.  As far as charging it every day, it will hurt the long term battery life because it's a lithium battery HOWEVER if you are planning on charging it every day anyway, then it doesn't matter because it will just stop holding as much charge as it could if you didn't charge it every day.  Source   keeping a Li-ion battery fully charged is not good for it either. This isn't because Li-ion batteries can get ""overcharged"" (something that people used to worry about in The Olden Days of portable computers), but a Li-ion battery that doesn't get used will suffer from capacity loss, meaning that it won't be able to hold as much charge and power your gadgets for as long. Extremely shallow discharges of only a couple percent are also not enough to keep a Li-ion battery in practice, so if you're going to pull the plug, let the battery run down for a little bit.   That is dealing with any Lithium-ion battery, which FitBits use as their batteries."
fitbit,3dq0s5,KetoThrowaway222,2,Sat Jul 18 11:56:29 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Fitbit!  Don't think charging it every day is going to be a serious issue. What model did you get? I've had the Charge HR for about 4 months now and I've charged it every 5 days.. No issues.  Accuracy wise for steps - pretty OK! Again depends on the model. I used to get steps from my Flex if I ever waved or shook my arm, but that doesn't happen with the Charge HR."
fitbit,3dq0s5,kyorah,2,Sat Jul 18 12:30:21 2015 UTC,"I found my HR doesn't count steps when I push a grocery cart. It was a real disappointment when I first went shopping, but with the lack of movement the lack of steps makes sense.  However, I'll sometimes strap it to my ankle, and I've found its accurate for steps and heart rate while pushing a cart :-)"
fitbit,3dq0s5,jotology,2,Sat Jul 18 12:57:25 2015 UTC,I've become a master of pushing a cart one handed so it will count my steps.
fitbit,3dq0s5,k_princess,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"If you have the HR I learned to stop caring about step number. I use it as an indicator if I've been more or less active, but really that's about all. When I go running I have both of my dogs with me and a leash on each wrist, so step counts aren't always perfect, same with pushing a cart. When I drive I never remembered to turn Drivebit on 100% of the time. Sometimes after sleeping I'd wake up with 300 steps from tossing and turning.  I use the calorie and heart rate monitoring more than anything, and they seem to work well. It lets me know if I should increase the intensity of my walks/jobs/etc and helps me get the most out of them, which I want. It helps guide calorie consumption to lose weight and stay in shape without eating way too little. 1500 calories on a relatively inactive day makes sense, but 1500 on a day when I burned 5400 just isn't enough.  As for step counts... eh. I now leave Drivebit off and don't watch which hand I'm holding things with, because it's just a guideline. Whether I walked 18,000 steps or 19,000 steps doesn't really matter to me, but if I had the same daily commute and the same distance run with the dogs it just tells me I was likely a bit more active the second day."

That way, I am made to get up, I'll set it to the number of steps to the kettle for a coffee! If the buzzing isn't enough to wake you I'd also set an alarm on your phone/ alarm clock/ radio for an audible wake up signal."
fitbit,3dpj35,JMLang,2,Sat Jul 18 08:12:39 2015 UTC,That would be a great idea! Although I'd probably end up shaking my arm instead of actually taking the steps..
fitbit,3dpj35,angry_squidward,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:08 2015 UTC,This is a brilliant idea - I'd definitely use that
fitbit,3dpj35,neschofield,3,Sun Jul 19 09:22:51 2015 UTC,I just set the alarm on my Fitbit and add an alarm about 5 mins later on my phone just incase
fitbit,3dpj35,Kowen14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"Same here. Fitbit is set at 4:00am, phone is set to 4:10am."
fitbit,3dpj35,ZshadeZ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"Um...my only suggestion is putting fitbit alarm at same time of regular alarm, if its your phone tablet or whatever."
fitbit,3dpj35,thirddayiii,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, I do have additional phone alarms with the fitbit. But the vibration does wake me up if it would do it consistently. I know it vibrates 3 times every once in awhile if it shows no movement. I do like the idea of the constant vibrate by taking a number of steps, etc. I know vibration drains battery life faster but it would still be a nice feature to have."
fitbit,3dp04w,pink_redditor,6,Sat Jul 18 01:58:53 2015 UTC,Welcome! The weekly challenges between friends can be really motivating! I've only had one for 5 months or so and have managed to drop 50 pounds in that time. The only tip I can think of right now is to try and log your food as you eat. It can be a bit of a hassle but if one waits until late in the day then a) budgeting extra calories becomes problematic and b) your food might not even get logged. Hope you enjoy..It really does get you moving.
fitbit,3dp04w,baldbert,2,Sat Jul 18 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, the challenges can be really, really motivating!"

fitbit,3dlnrx,laaabaseball,12,Fri Jul 17 07:25:56 2015 UTC,I was on a road trip once and ask of a sudden my Flex vibrates to tell me I met my step goal.  Apparently the vibrations of the steering wheel got me 14k steps.
fitbit,3dlnrx,TeacherTish,2,Fri Jul 17 14:02:24 2015 UTC,"My biggest step day was when my fitbit sat in a saddlebag of my motorcycle for a cruise. I took it off my wrist to try and keep it from counting vibrations, but apparently my flex really wanted me to have the 20k badge..."
fitbit,3dlnrx,mathematical,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"Exact same thing happened to me. I felt my phone vibrating every little bit- when I finally looked I saw that I had ""climbed"" 249 floors (the vibrations were notifications of ""earned"" badges) and gone about 25,000 steps. I leave the One at home on rides now."

I tiredly didn't check and had missed keying in a digit, it immediately freaked out and gave me badges and notifications and emails for meeting my weight loss goal and how awesome that was.

fitbit,3dlnrx,ConvertsToMetric,2,Sat Jul 18 00:58:50 2015 UTC,I did a tour of factory the other day with a few staircases.  My boss has one of the wrist ones (I'm not sure which) and I have the One in my pocket.  We did the exact same tour and the started at the same place in terms of flights of stairs.  By the end of the tour I had 12 flights and she had 6.  I think mine was the more accurate.

fitbit,3dogzu,NocnikTajemnic,3,Fri Jul 17 23:05:47 2015 UTC,The problem with stuff like that is measurement.   How would an accelerometer judge between a push up and an arm movement? How would it know the length of your arm (and therefore the amount of movement associated with you going down) even if you tell it you're doing push ups? Same with sit ups.
fitbit,3dogzu,mvs5191,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:17 2015 UTC,just let me enter those numbers - that will do it for me.  I will enter the number of push ups time i did them and i guess lenghts of my arms and i would be so happy.
fitbit,3dogzu,sodiumlaurethsulfate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose part of the problem here is that Fitbit works in steps, and that only works with walking/running. How many steps would a push up be? Unless you're doing like an hour of them a day, the calorie expenditure is pretty minimal too.  I log this stuff in the journal, which isn't perfect but at least keeps it together."

fitbit,3dnu0m,evilbunny77,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:48:33 2015 UTC,"I went for a bike ride today, which my Charge HR seemed to count as a few thousand steps. I held the button to start an activity before setting off. During my ride the device vibrated to congratulate me on 10,000 steps, and by the time I got home it was over 12,000.  At home I went to the fitbit log and registered the (existing) activity as a bike ride, which was then listed as '0% of your 12,000 steps'. But it DIDN'T rescind the 'steps' it had counted while I was pedalling.  Did I do something wrong?"
fitbit,3dnu0m,nnt_,2,Sat Jul 18 22:08:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know. When I cycle, my flex sometimes goes in and out of workout mode / sleep mode from the vibrations. Did you check that it covers the entire ride? (I don't have a Charge, so don't know if this is something that could happen.) It's also possible that fitbit have changed their approach. But if that is the case, I don't know why!"
fitbit,3dnu0m,UnlimitedMusketWorks,3,Sun Jul 19 05:21:22 2015 UTC,"You could use Strava, the popular cycling app, to track your rides. If Strava and Fitbit are linked, your Strava activity will appear in Fitbit within minutes of finishing."

fitbit,3dk8nz,sandman369,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:55 2015 UTC,If you link mpf and your fitbit you don't manually enter exercises involving walking- fitbit has already counted them so when it links with mpf it sends the data through and mfp makes the necessary adjustments to your calories. You'll find it will make changes both up and down but the end calories count will be correct.
fitbit,3dk8nz,Cazzowary,2,Fri Jul 17 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"also you should update your diary setting to enable negative adjustments so the calorie count is on point.    A negative adjustment means that your projected calorie burn for the day from the partner is below MyFitnessPal's initial estimate. If you are unable to sync your tracking device until late in the day, or if you don't consistently use your tracking device, you may prefer not to enable negative adjustments"
fitbit,3dk8nz,jdowney1982,2,Fri Jul 17 11:16:08 2015 UTC,I read around this a lot when I got my fitbit a couple of months ago and the overwhelming consensus was that you should do all activity logging through the fitbit and all food logging through my fitness pal. Never cross over as you'll end up double counting. That's been working really well for me so far.

fitbit,3dilq4,Starfire69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"I've been worried about this the last several days since I have around a 45 minute commute each way myself.   I downloaded the Drivebit app and used it every time I was driving today... 3 total hours. It negated any steps during that period, so I was happy my count would be more realistic. It actually only made about a 200 step difference from the 4 days I did the exact same things in the day without using it. I decided that ~200 steps wasn't really worth the time to bother with the app since I hit around 20k daily, so I uninstalled it.  It exists, it works, I just decided if I'm commuting to work every day the number of steps it shows doesn't really matter since it will be roughly the same every workday.  Commute without the app and get fake steps recorded, go jogging after work, end at 17,000 steps, and try to maintain that daily or every other day, or whatever you prefer.  Commute with app and no fake steps, go jogging after work, end at 16,500 steps, and try to maintain that daily or every other day, or whatever you prefer.  Doesn't really make a difference. The step # is meaningless to me, I only care for it as a rating of how active I've been compared to usual... if I've stepped it up or cut back. Steps work to show that whether they have the same daily commute fakery involved or not, and calories burned even better."
fitbit,3dilq4,ZshadeZ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'm able to negate steps by creating the activity while I'm doing it (don't know how it works on the flex, but on mine, I hold the button down until it vibrates when I start and stop). Then I create a ""Driving"" activity from the menu and have it start at the same time as my measured activity and last for the same amount of time.    It will only negate the steps if I've logged the initial activity that I don't want to count by timing it on my fitbit. Don't know if you're doing that too, but that's how I've gotten it to work."
fitbit,3diqm7,cornybread,9,Thu Jul 16 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, it comes with a partial charge. I gifted one to my dad a few weeks ago and let him do the unboxing.

fitbit,3dhwa0,jarkarawr,4,Thu Jul 16 13:04:49 2015 UTC,That's normal. It is estimating how many calories you've already burned for the day up to the point you put it on. Even when you wake up it will have some number of calories burned.I'm sure someone else can explain in greater detail.

Fitbit Flex doesn't have GPS, so I'm not convinced you can ever trust the distance number it provides. Who says every single one of your strides is exactly the same length, so exact that it can be used to judge total distance? I use that number as a reference, not an exact figure."

fitbit,3dhv8p,adminbeast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely take it off.  I'd suggest you don't even bring it: if you're like most people, you'll hit at least 8k-10k steps on an all-day trip to an amusement park without even trying.

Am I the only one who thinks the button should have been on the other side of the unit? I feel like this would have been more convenient for right-handed people (at the expense of left-handed people I suppose :p) who are likely wearing the unit on their left hand. Using my thumb to press the button feels a little annoying compared to if the button was on the other side and I could just use my index finger. I'm sure I'll get used to it though.

fitbit,3dd4nt,CessnaMir,2,Wed Jul 15 10:19:10 2015 UTC,Band quality/material is identical. The difference is the snap clasp on the Charge vs the traditional watch clasp on the HR. The HR will not fall off your wrist and get lost like the Charge will. I have a friend who lost his Charge just yesterday because it fell off and he didn't notice.

The continual HR monitoring is great (it does take it into account for the calories I believe) and really helps tailor workouts effectively.

It's definitely difficult to stay disciplined and I still don't get my 10k steps 2-3 days of the week, but I'm trying, because I know my desk job is slowly killing me :D"

Once we started standing all day, I noticed a nice increase in my step count, due in part because I find myself walking around the office a lot more since im not on my ass all day.   Speak to your management or HR or whomever has the authority to make these decisions. There are quite a lot of good reasons to invest in these desks and they aren't too expensive. Plus, it always looks good from a media and business perspective for a company to take new health initiatives for their employees.

fitbit,3dcmfg,thirdhonk,2,Wed Jul 15 05:42:22 2015 UTC,To track running you'll need to use the exercise tracker in the Fitbit app. The device itself can not differentiate running and walking.
fitbit,3dcmfg,numel007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:54:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  So once I start the Exercise tracker, does every step I take - does the FitBit assume Im running?  So if I run 2 miles and walk a half mile to cool down, does it think I am running 2.5 miles?  What is nice about the S Health app is it can differentiate between walking and running.  Thanks"
fitbit,3dcmfg,numel007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:07:58 2015 UTC,"The app will track your splits, but that's as close to being able to differentiate between walking and running it will do.

fitbit,3dc1o6,LucentBirch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"The ""amount remaining to eat"" changes over the day, so it tries to keep you at your deficit level, but it doesn't know how much exercise you will do later on.   If you have a regular daily routine, exercise-wise, just use that amount minus your deficit to figure out your rough daily intake amount.   The daily goal is adjustable - on the website if you use the beta tiles click the cog icon (appears after hovering over the amount burned today/distance walked today tile) and it should flip over, allowing you to change the targets. Edit: here's a quick gif I made demonstrating it: http://imgur.com/UeOzmQK"
fitbit,3dc1o6,psaldorn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:12:51 2015 UTC,You can just set all the goals manually.
fitbit,3dc1o6,FinnTheDogg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:25:49 2015 UTC,If you've burnt 1700 and eaten 1600 then you are over your goal because you're aiming to eat 500 calories less than you burn. If you eat 1600 calories in a day and your goal is a 500 deficit then to reach your goal you need to burn 2100 calories.
fitbit,3dbc28,frosty_biscuits,2,Tue Jul 14 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"It's certainly possible. I'm completely sedentary except for 2 hours of slow, deliberate walking and that nets me around 15k, so your running + non-sedentary life could be 23k no problem.  But it is worth taking a closer look at the lawn mowing. If you know what time you were doing this activity you can track that time as truck driving and it will remove any steps calculated. Very bumpy roads, very rough rides, etc. can cause steps to accumulate, so if you were holding a very vibrate-y lawn mower or sitting on a bumpy riding mower it's possible it overcounted."
fitbit,3dbc28,AtomikRadio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:15:23 2015 UTC,I would have thought that keeping my hands on the mower would have actually reduced the amount it counted. Interesting that the bumps and vibrations can up it. Thanks for the input.

Also, I've been tracking my weight and predicted weight loss (which is from the cumulative calorie deficit calculated by fitbit) since May 11th, and if you do a trend on the weight to smooth it out, it's pretty damn close: http://tr.avi.st/fitbit.html (sorry it's kind of ugly, I just use the site for myself)"
fitbit,3dccun,slix00,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:22 2015 UTC,"Edit: Added my own sleep logs so you can see if these stats are sufficient  There is no REM vs non-REM sleep, but it will show what periods you are restless or awake.  For example, it shows that I'm in bed for 8 hours but calculate that I actually slept for 7 hours due to the multiple times of restlessness.  I haven't tried the Android app, but, I am also trying to monitor my sleep for health reasons, and a good thing about the Charge HR is that I don't have to remember to toggle a button to make it start tracking sleep, or turn it off when I get up.  It also tracks my naps more accurately now (after firmware v84 update).  The downsides:  For me, the sleep log doesn't usually start until I am actually asleep, so it doesn't tell me how long it took me to fall asleep.  However, I looked at some past logs, and saw that one night it did detect it took me 7 min to fall asleep (first graph). The second graph has red bars in the beginning indicating that I was still awake for 6 minutes, but states it took me 0 min to fall asleep.  If you write down the time you get into bed, you can edit the sleep log the next day so that the sleep time starts earlier, and then the band will appear as an ""awake"" band.  I think that'll affect the sleep efficiency calculation, too, but I haven't tested it."

fitbit,3dao8u,Jotap28,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"Works fine for me. Sometimes a bit slow copying over to Fitbit.   When I complete my ride in Strava, it (eventually) copies over to Fitbit as a cycling activity. Heart rate graph shows on the activity on Fitbit, but it doesn't appear to get copied back over to Strava.  When I complete a run using the Fitbit app, the running activity copies over to Strava as a run with GPS data and heart rate date.  Would be nice if the Fitbit app allowed for recording a cycle activity."
fitbit,3dao8u,MisuVir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply! Do you start a activity on fitbit (either through app or long press on hardware)? do you only log it using strava? what's your standard procedure?

When I'm done I get a notification in about 30 sec from Strava that the activity synced.  By doing it this way the heart rate data gets synced to Strava.  When starting the tracking in the Fitbit app there are only 3 options for activity type (Run, Walk, Hike) and I always use ""Run"" for bike rides.  You cannot edit the activity type in the Fitbit dashboard, but in Strava you can edit everything and it will calculate the cycling specific stats."

fitbit,3d9g0e,Exquisite_Aegis,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe because it predicts expenditure based on the expenditure so far. If she's been sleeping, Fitbit thinks, ""she's not active now, won't be later."""
fitbit,3d9g0e,Crustal_Math,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I think that your Daily Calorie Estimate setting is on sedentary, which starts low and lets you ""earn"" calories throughout the day. Hers might be on personalized, which estimates calorie intake for the day based on past days.   I use sedentary so I'm not sure about this, but it might also adjust based on that day's movement. She started at 1100, but then got no steps so the food plan adjusted for less calories.   To see if this is the problem, go to  your Log. On the ""food plan"" square, there is a blue cog that you can click to choose either personalized or sedentary."

fitbit,3da4oj,boner79,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Which device are you using?  I've graduated to the Surge (and am loving it) but would like to be able to customize the activities as well; particularly those that require GPS. I do SUP boarding a few times a week but in order to track it using GPS I have to choose either biking, hiking, walking, or running. I've just been going with biking the last several times."
fitbit,3da4oj,dick122,2,Tue Jul 14 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"Charge HR.  Love it, just a few things (like this) I feel would be easy tweaks to make the whole experience better."
fitbit,3da4oj,KetoThrowaway222,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"You can't do this with any of their devices unfortunately. People were clamoring over that when it came to biking and they finally put that in earlier this year but most likely they will never have a custom workout that uses the GPS. They currently do have an option called ""Workout"" that will track your heart rate but not your GPS, as well as calories burned and stuff and then you can rename it on the website to whatever you were doing (I do this with my crossfit classes) but that is the only ""custom"" like option on the surge other than making custom activities on the website."
fitbit,3da4oj,KetoThrowaway222,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"In the app? No, not that I know of. But you can add custom activites on the website and then they will be shown in your recent activities on the app."
fitbit,3dal8b,ElevenSleven,2,Tue Jul 14 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"When I was debating between the two, none of the extra features of the surge appealed to me very much and certainly not $100 of appeal, so for me it was a fairly easy choice to get the charge HR. Most of the features of the surge can be fairly well accommodated for by using 3rd party apps and the charge HR is significantly slimmer than the surge."
fitbit,3d9evg,azGAAR,2,Tue Jul 14 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can put it in your pocket! It's one of the recommended ways to wear it, just make sure it's snug enough that it doesn't fall out. I find the button is hard enough to push that random presses don't do uch.  Re: Zip vs. One, One all the way. It's smaller, tracks your sleep, counts your floors, and can wake you up with vibrations. If you can't afford the One, though, I have plenty of friends in love with their Zips."

It affected a number of devices including FitBits. I think the issue has since been resolved but i'm not 100% sure (Still on 4.4)   If the LG G4 is on the latest stable of Android, then you should be fine. As for the phone size, you are upgrading from a very small phone to a very large one. Such a size difference will take getting used to, but the G4 is not so big that it'll cause problems when walking or exercising."
fitbit,3d892e,Kenno90,2,Tue Jul 14 11:05:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. =)  I have an android tablet but really only use it for e-books and watching Netflix while fixing dinner haha. Other than that I don't know much about Android.   Just want to make sure I get one that works with my needs. One of the biggest reasons for upgrading are there are so much better fitness apps that won't work on the iPhone 4s. Just want to make sure they work on the new one ;)  Thanks again.
fitbit,3d892e,Kenno90,2,Tue Jul 14 12:39:32 2015 UTC,Well i'd be almost positive the fitbit would work with the G4. Its a brand new phone.  Android is alot different than an apple phone and would take some getting used to. The reason many fitness apps may not work on your 4S is because its quite an old phone at this stage.   Have you thought about updating to an iphone 6? I'm sure the fitness apps available for that phone is impressive.
fitbit,3d892e,Kenno90,2,Tue Jul 14 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about updating to an iphone 6?   That was my original plan.   I was going to wait until fall to see if Apple was going to have a new version of the iPhone (6s?) and to see if prices would go down for the normal 6 or 6+ or maybe even just get the new 6s or +. Then I started looking at the prices, even going with the least storage (16g) they were still starting at €700 to €800 (6&+).  Spec wise, you just seemed like you got so much more for your buck going with something like the LG G4 or Samsung S6.  I would love a new 6+ but not sure if I can justify the price (to myself) when there are other options.  I was first thinking about just spending about 250-350 for a 5s but then thought I didn't want to upgrade to a phone that is already 2 years old.  Sorry for rambling. Your input is much appreciated."
fitbit,3d892e,squidzilla,2,Tue Jul 14 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Haha you're not rambling, I'm just happy to help.   They are both amazing phones that's for sure, the fitbit will work with both fine. I'm more of an android person, i've only ever owned one iPhone. I just know a lot of people that switch from an iPhone and regret their decision as it takes a while to get used to android.  Spec wise, on paper android phones always look more impressive, but since apple owns both the hardware and software of the iphone they utilise the best from both. So even though the specs are not as good , in the real world the iphone does an amazing job with what its got.  The only thing that the G4/S6 will excell is the screen, both in size and resolution. (but at this stage it's must to do with preference)  Also one thing you need to consider is any paid apps you bought on the iphone wont be carried over to the android version. Say you paid for runtasic pro, you'll have to buy it again on android.  Check out /r/Android , /r/lgg4 & /r/GalaxyS6"
fitbit,3d892e,FatalIll,2,Tue Jul 14 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"I have the LG G3, so a model behind the G4 but fairly compatible. It works great with my Fitbit. A couple of things I've noticed:   If I haven't synced in a couple of days, it will only sync today's information. I usually have to use my computer dongle to sync past days' stats, however, this did happen with my iPhone 4S as well. It's a big-ass phone. I have tiny lady hands. Carrying the phone and exercising is not fun. I picked up a FlipBelt and my G3 fits perfectly, even comfortably due to the bezelled back (it sits against the small of my back). The G3 makes elliptical running the bomb because I can watch big, shiny videos and make the time fly by!   Feel free to ask me any questions about the generic LG G* experience."
fitbit,3d7b42,Briggsc,3,Tue Jul 14 02:07:06 2015 UTC,It is a pain.  I have asked Fitbit for access to all those metrics in a nice format that we can use.  Not enough people have asked for it. I want a monthly view of my HR and the website only allows weekly.  Go on the forums and vent a little.

fitbit,3d7b42,939319,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:01 2015 UTC,There's no official way. https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/Ability-to-export-HR-data/idi-p/794526 In the first place I think it only stores 5-minute averages. But since the data is available on the website I think you can create a Chrome extension or something to extract it.
fitbit,3d7b42,FatalIll,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"I believe the 5-minute averages are if its not set to actively sync, if its never not syncing, I think it does it continuously. I could be wrong."
fitbit,3d7b42,939319,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"Could be, I only sync once a day. ""Continuous"" sync is only every 15 minutes, though. Gotta try, but the wonky line graph the website uses is already hard enough to read for 5 minute intervals."
fitbit,3d7b42,939319,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:02 2015 UTC,"Nah looks like it's always 5-minute averages. I found out, on the web dashboard, when viewing an exercise you can drag the time scale out and get sub-minute readings."

I upgraded from Flex to HR, haven't been in my usual environment since then, so I can't speak to its accuracy.     I am really looking forward to the stair count, because I climb lots of stairs. I know that call notification is going to save my ass and help me miss less calls. Automatic sleep tracking is awesome. For me, I hit a point with Flex where I really wanted the thing I wore around my wrist all the time to tell me what time it is....       I got my flex as a gadget, out of curiosity of how active I am. (I work in technical theatre so I have weeks of sitting at a table, and weeks of walking 15,000 steps a day).      I'm not a huge fan of how it fits on me, because I'm so absurdly tiny (Flex goes into the 3rd and 4th holes on the small wristband).      But yes, I think it's useful information to have; peoples thoughts on accuracy vary greatly.     Sorry this was so disjointed and all over the map, I'm about half asleep"

fitbit,3d5k96,cupp95,3,Wed Jul 15 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"I have a One, Surge and Charge HR. I also have a Zip that I don't use anymore.  I asked for the One for Christmas because I wanted to get stair credit. I then got the Surge for the GPS tracking and really liked it, but it got damaged one humid day and while waiting for a replacement I purchased the HR.  I actually wear the One daily because step count is most accurate on it. I wear the HR in addition most days because the heart rate gets me more calories burned (calorie tracking in MFP). I wear the Surge when I feel like getting text and call notifications on my wrist or am going running.  Of the 3, the HR is probably my favorite because it offers a nice blend of what I need in a medium package.  I don't think you will regret purchasing one."

fitbit,3d5k96,Spacemilk,5,Mon Jul 13 19:20:36 2015 UTC,I wear my loose on my wrist and check it often while running. It seems pretty accurate. I enjoy the resting bpm and sleep tracking the most. I've noticed as I get in better shape my resting rate has dropped 4 bpm and I get more restful sleep.
fitbit,3d5k96,cali_grown22,3,Mon Jul 13 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"I can comment on this because I do not use it for workout tracking, I have a garmin watch for that.  Because of this I wear a chest strap HR monitor and have compared readings on my watch vs charge and most of the time they are within a couple BPM.  I also really like the resting HR calculation, you can really see how alcohol consumption will raise it (A LOT!) or stressful days, then days when you relax.  I have seen mine go from low 60s down to 54 in a couple weeks due to different conditions."
fitbit,3d5k96,zxxkimxxz,2,Mon Jul 13 22:07:27 2015 UTC,It's pretty accurate. I don't check my pulse while running manually but I think it's pretty close.

fitbit,3d5k96,MyFreakyThrowaway,3,Tue Jul 14 06:11:26 2015 UTC,"I have the Charge HR and would highly recommend it. There was a new upgrade that just came out and it lets you see the time now when you bring up your wrist instead of having to press buttons. You can also tap through all the options to see how many steps, calories, etc without having to press the button.  As for the heart rate option, I've worn it while also wearing my polar heart rate monitor and found that they are pretty similar. It may not be perfectly in sync, but the calories burned after different types of workout were less than 10 calories away from each other so I've started using only my fitbit during workouts. It does help to wear it higher on your arm during workouts in order to get a better reading on blood circulation.   The resting heart rate feature is awesome! I love being able to monitor my fitness that way. I've dropped it considerable over the last three months so it's rewarding to see the change numerically.  I had the One before this, so I can't totally speak to switching from the Flex, but I do know that I'd be frustrated if I had to sync in order to view my stats. I love that everything is right there on my wrist whenever I need it.  Definitely get it!!"

Like I said, it doesn't match up perfectly the whole time (like if I looked at my HRM it might say 170 and my FitBit might say 155) but the calories burned at the end were pretty much the same which is what I truly cared about."
fitbit,3d5k96,Catto0703,3,Tue Jul 14 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"I got the HR as my first fitbit and I am loving it. The continuous heart rate monitor really tells a lot about you during your day. My only complaint is that it slips pretty easily when I sweat, so I either wear it too tight or I have to adjust it periodically.   And I read that you were concerned that you'd have to take it off for showers. I always use that time to put it on the charger. There has been one day where I've had to stop myself just seconds before a major oopsie, but once you get in the habit, it's no big deal. Just treat it like a watch."

fitbit,3d49iw,firemanjoe911,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:00 2015 UTC,I just realized this as well after I updated my macbook. Does anyone know a workaround? And how much data does the FitBit (I have the HR) store before it needs to sync?

fitbit,3d49iw,Banda3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:46 2015 UTC,I think the only solution is to temporarily synchronize it from a different device.

fitbit,3d5y3s,Ady88w1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:58 2015 UTC,Did you log your exercise?
fitbit,3d5y3s,AlreadyThrownAway33W,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I just found out how to do that after I posted here.  So now it's showing:   Burnt - 4305 kcal Eaten - 1744 kcal Left - 1795 kcal   It seems to be telling me that I need to be eating double what I am currently."
fitbit,3d5y3s,AlreadyThrownAway33W,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, a -1000 kcal deficit on a TDEE of 4305 would double your calories.   When cutting, I tend to ignore the TDEE and stick to a set caloric load, giving me wiggle room. I don't use the food plan tracker in the app, I just log and make sure I'm at -1000/-15000 kcal for the day."
fitbit,3d5y3s,AlreadyThrownAway33W,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I've done a couple of days now to look at the data. It looks FitBit is being a bit generous with regards to calories burnt. This morning I did a comparison of the calorie count with the read out from the Cross Trainer.   FB = 1,100 CT = 750   Even if you give an overly generous 100 kcal for an hourly BMR it seems the figures are a bit off. After all FB doesn't know the resistance and elevation levels of the machine, so the machine should be more accurate in this instance (but then again the machine knows nothing about me).  I'm going to keep to my 1900 intake as you suggest and ignore that portion of the app :)"
fitbit,3d4uf0,believe_lander,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:15:07 2015 UTC,Just like any calorie count the fit bit is just a guesstimate. Your metabolism is going to vary depending on lots of different factors. You will get a calorie total based off of your BMR and the amount of moving around or exercise that you do. That amount will be a lot more accurate than an online calorie calculator. Honestly if you're not seeing progress with your weight loss you're probably either eating the amount you need to eat to maintain your weight OR your fat loss isn't being reflected by the scale. Fat loss isn't linear- it comes in fits and starts.
fitbit,3d64vc,anotherguy2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:43:19 2015 UTC,I'd like to know this as well. Can't for the life of me figure out how to plot a days worth of continuous heart rate.
fitbit,3d64vc,e1_diabl0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"In the iOS app, tap on resting heart rate. Your daily/weekly HR graphs will be down the bottom.  You can also get them on the web site by changing a dropdown near one of the existing graphs. Edit: The big graph at the top. I believe it defaults to steps, but you can change it to HR and daily/week/month."
fitbit,3d4dkm,Hopko682,7,Mon Jul 13 12:45:29 2015 UTC,"I've been tracking my calorie intake and weight for a very long time now and calculate my TDEE to go with it. I picked up a Fitbit a few weeks ago and have added its TDEE to my log. When I compare my actual TDEE (calculated based on food and weight change) to Fitbit's TDEE, the Fitbit is, on average, about 75 calories lower than actual TDEE...with a TDEE of ~2900, so it's within 3%.  I love how accurate that is, because it makes my target food intake so much easier. I still record calories in, weight, and Fitbit TDEE. I put that into Excel and it spits out my average TDEE between actual and Fitbit and then add/remove based on whether I want to gain or lose (I do bulk & cut cycles). The Fitbit helps me get to target calories per day with a varied activity level....For a numbers guy like me, this thing rocks and makes my life a lot easier.  YMMV."
fitbit,3d4dkm,IAmCorrectAMA,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, that's good to hear from someone they can rely on the data. I thought the calories it was telling me was a little high. I guess I won't know until I experiment and play around with my diet a little hey?"
fitbit,3d4dkm,pearlsbswine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's hard for a little program like a fitbit to understand the full workings of your body. I find fitbit to be much higher than it should be. If I ate as much as it says I should eat, I'd be fat.  Figuring out what your calorie maintenance is can be an annoying process, but once you find it out it's pretty helpful. Try eating 2500 calories a day for a week or two and see what happens with your weight. Calibrate as needed. It's really the only thing that I've been able to figure out that actually works."

Because I have an active job and it gets bumped/dinged a lot I've been avoiding using my new one (compliments of Fitbit because mine is literally falling apart) because I'm afraid it will happen in six months again.  When I briefly saw the HR it looked like it's a totally different band and even different material. Seems more ""one piece"" than the Charge."
fitbit,3d6hr5,CessnaMir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:08:58 2015 UTC,"Charge HR band is much, much better. It uses a standard watch clasp that works much better. I upgraded from the Charge to the HR after a month."

fitbit,3d1j6n,andyi89,2,Sun Jul 12 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"I can't speak personally because I haven't tried it, but my friends who have the Charge HR use an app called 'Strava' from the Play Store which apparently integrates really well with the Charge HR."

fitbit,3d1j6n,Doceng,2,Mon Jul 13 10:50:00 2015 UTC,"Start tracking your ride with the Fitbit app on your phone.  When you finish it will sync the data to Strava including your heart rate (as long as you have linked your Fitbit and Strava accounts).  If you start tracking in Strava it will not pull in your heart rate data from Fitbit.  I use this method to track all my rides and it works well.  The one thing that I don't like is Fitbit only lets you choose between Run, Walk, and Hike when you start tracking in the app (I always choose Run) and you can't edit it later in the dashboard.  However, once the ride syncs to Strava you can open it and edit all the details including the activity type.  You can then look at all the cycling specific stats and segments in Strava.  From my experience the Fitbit app will calculate the calories for your ride with your heart rate, whereas Strava does not seem to do that even when the HR data is synced over.  For example if I go on my same neighborhood ride and go easy the calories reported by Fitbit and Strava will be pretty close, but if I ride harder Fitbit will report significantly more calories and Strava will barely increase.  It seems to me that the Fitbit is more accurate."
fitbit,3d1j6n,05cantwellt,2,Mon Jul 13 13:37:06 2015 UTC,"I used Strava just the other day for this purpose. Phone takes care of GPS, distance, time and some other Strava features. Fitbit takes care of heart rate, heart rate zone, calories and active minutes.  When they're integrated, Fitbit will log any Strava data as an activity view able in the app or on the dashboard"
fitbit,3d1j6n,ajh499,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:00:29 2015 UTC,"When they're integrated doesn't Strava's calories count over-write that from the FitBit?   I haven't really found a good way to use the FitBit when cycling, the calories burnt should be pretty accurate on the Charge HR as it comes from the heart rate, but you end up with a crazy step count (and therefore number of floors climbed).  I actually use Endomondo with a separate Heart Rate Monitor when cycling and have that linked to FitBit, the calories burnt seem to be pretty close that way to what the FitBit comes up with. I just use Strava standalone, without being linked to FitBit."
fitbit,3d1j6n,05cantwellt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"I believe it does overwrite the calories but the calorie count is very close to that measured by Fitbit on similar bike rides I have done without Strava. Also as Strava is recorded as an activity, the steps acquired throughout the bike ride are not counted. If Strava is set to pause when you stop riding - I believe Fitbit takes over until you restart riding.  Ive only used it a few times so still getting the hang of it."
fitbit,3d1j6n,ajh499,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:21:50 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, it doesn't matter that something is imported as an activity from an another app, FitBit doesn't ignore the step count. The only time that it does is when the activity is ""driving"". See my thread on the FitBit community page.  Also, I don't think that FitBit supports pausing an activity, it just has a single start and stop time, so unless Strava creates multiple activities (split up when paused) then it will still be over-writing the FitBit calories data, but keeping the crazy step count!  I haven't actually tried Strava integrated with FitBit though, when I was looking at it the integration was broken, plus, at least for me, I don't think Strava's calorie counts are very accurate."
fitbit,3d1j6n,05cantwellt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:58:43 2015 UTC,"There is definitely flaws in the integration between Strava and Fitbit as I think Strava would prefer you to use one of their own trackers for cycling only.  And i believe you are right in terms of Fitbit not recognizing a paused activity. In the dashboard it shows one block for the activity - only the timer is stopped for inactivity.  Next time I go cycling I will try out Endomondo, it looks a lot lighter than Strava which can get a bit muddled with the different menus and features"
fitbit,3d1j6n,ajh499,2,Mon Jul 13 09:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Endomondo will integrate much better, I think the problems are on the FitBit end really.  The only reason I use it, is that I have a separate Heart Rate Monitor that Endomondo uses for calories burnt. Strava will pick up the readings from it, but it doesn't use if for its calorie calculations.  I actually run both apps on my phone at the same time, Endomondo to feed calories burnt into FitBit (so I don't usually wear my FitBit at all when cycling) and Strava as I think it's generally a better app for cycling."
fitbit,3d1j6n,ajh499,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:08:28 2015 UTC,"I tried Endomondo, last night and found it quite straight forward. i don't think i had my settings set correctly though, as it didn't sync to my fitbit dashboard. :( I have sorted this now.  I have downloaded Strava, and will test this afternoon. looking in the Fitbit dashboard Strava looks promising as it has a lot more access and write requests.  I find it crazy that the FitBit app only offers cycling with the surge! i just expected it to be included with all as it can use my phones GPS."
fitbit,3d23eo,VTFD,2,Sun Jul 12 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Fitbit isn't really well adapted to tracking weight training, at least not by sets/reps like you seem interested in doing.   I used to use Fitocracy as well because I liked the tracking aspect as well as the points system since it sorta approximates the difficulty of your workout. What I didn't like is that it seemed favor certain exercises like squats and deadlifts over others and so it was biased in that respect. When I got my Charge HR I stopped using Fitocracy because the workout log performed a similar function in that it tracked the intensity of my workouts, but it was more objective because it was strictly based on time, heart rate, calories burned, etc. and thus wasn't as arbitrary as Fitocracy.   Now I use the Evernote app as a simple workout log to keep track of the actual sets/reps, and while it can be a little more time intensive than Fitocracy (since you have to make the effort to make the notes for the workouts) I like it because it's more flexible. Plus it seemed like every time they updated Fitocracy they made it worse with all the videos and stuff that made the logging aspect of it more difficult to use, so I just abandoned it.  tl;dr: Fitbit is not a good app for logging your actual workout data (sets/reps) but is good to keep track of your overall workout routine (days you worked out, intensity of the workouts)."
fitbit,3d23eo,Tilden_Katz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:26:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for a thoughtful response.  I really want to keep track of my reps/sets/weights.  I'm trying to hit/break PRs and stay on a specific barbell program.  This is really disappointing : (
fitbit,3d23eo,Tilden_Katz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately you will probably need to keep using something like Fitocracy for that. I was somewhat disappointed too since I have similar goals, but part of the issue is that Fitbit seems more geared towards people just trying to ""get fit"" in a general sense as opposed to people with serious athletic or fitness goals. I keep hoping that fitbit starts to cater more toward the athlete crowd though, but we'll see.  As it is right now, your Charge HR and the fitbit app are really just useful supplements to whatever you use to keep track of your routine. For me, I noticed that using the Charge's workout timer and having my heart rate easily available during my workouts made me pay a lot more attention to my rests and my heart rate zone, so I was able to increase the intensity of my workouts by regulating those aspects of my routine better. Also, the heart rate info that the app displays is useful in seeing which sets were more strenuous than others, even if they didn't feel as difficult at the time."

Yes, you can log multiple workouts per day. I do it a decent amount.  For me at least, the heart rate monitor was absolutely worth the extra money.

fitbit,3d0dyg,OJ1414,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"Usually have shifts of 2-3 minutes during the game with 4-6 minutes off before the next shift, then have two five-minute intermissions during the game. Winds up with an HR spike for each shift.   I'd say just leave it going during the break. You'll have the recovery/HR dip in the middle but it'll be good to have that info."
fitbit,3d0dyg,ZshadeZ,3,Sun Jul 12 18:24:05 2015 UTC,Definitely go for the HR. The Heart rate monitor is actually very good and shows a graph of the entire exercise period that you can review later. For HIIT you just keep it running the entire time if you want best resuilts. What was your highest hr during each of your turns? How low did it get during the waiting breaks? Which thing pushed it the best? It's a great tool.

Under that it shows breakdowns of your last several workouts (mine are just walking the puppies) and figures out calorie burn based on height/weight/heart rate. Under that is distance walked/jogged/run/today. Two to the right of that shows calories eaten vs calories burned. Above that is progress towards the calorie burn per day goal you set in the app. And then how much sleep you got and times woken or restless. You can click on any of these to expand them farther and get more info. If you click on my last workout of 39 minutes (hike with the dogs) it brings up the second image.  http://i.imgur.com/nkAg7AY.png  This shows average heart rate through the hike average but also the nice continual graph, so you can see what parts of a normal route you should work at building speed at, etc to keep your rate up. The second graph shows time in heart rate zones... fat burn, cardio, and peak. Looks like I'm burning fat and borderline cardio, so if I pick the speed up just a bit I should be in cardio heart rate zone throughout. Calories burned per minute is useful, and under that are total steps, calories burn, and minutes of being active.  Calculates calorie burn based on age/weight/height/heart rate.  I definitely suggest the HR. It's shiny."

You've gone through 3 of them, but it's still Fitbits fault, can't be anything you're doing wrong. The end user is never wrong. /s  Anyway, try charging it via a different outlet, different power source all together. People tend to think More Juice, Faster Charge... things are rated for different voltages for a reason. If you find yourself generally sweaty during the day, loosen up the band, let the bottom of the device breath, make sure the charging port is clear of sweat and debris that might be causing problems."
fitbit,3cyr0l,FatalIll,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:55 2015 UTC,"How are you charging it?  Honestly,  the problem is more likely the power source than the device. You need to be plugging it into computer's usb port."
fitbit,3cyr0l,danceydancetime,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:57:31 2015 UTC,How do you charge it? if you're using a wall outlet stop doing that! they're only designed to be charged from a USB port. This thread has some info from a user.

fitbit,3cymni,Simmerj94,2,Sat Jul 11 23:35:01 2015 UTC,"What you can do is get something like Strava, which will use your phone GPS to track your ride, and then sync that with Fitbit.  I'm not sure whether that gives you HR information though...  GPS is one of the main reasons I went for a Surge instead of a Charge..."
fitbit,3cymni,cyronius,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, gotcha. I'd get a Band but it doesn't have food tracking and MyFitnessPal doesn't sync past 3 days (I have 5 months of data) for any of its connected apps.  Hopefully that Amazon Prime sale has the Surge on sale."
fitbit,3cymni,Doceng,2,Sun Jul 12 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"When I go for a ride I start tracking through the Fitbit app on my phone.  After I stop it in the Fitbit app I get a notification from Strava the the ride was synced there.  When I open it on Strava it has all the data including my heart rate from my Charge HR.  The only down side that I can see is when you start tracking in the Fitbit app you have to choose an activity type and there are only three (run, walk, hike), so I always choose run and then edit the details in Strava later.  For some reason you cannot edit the activity type later in the Fitbit dashboard but that is something that could easily be changed with an update."
fitbit,3cymni,Doceng,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"but that is something that could easily be changed with an update.   That's true but it's been 3 months since they introduced biking with the Surge and the Strava partnership, so I hope something like that doesn't take much longer! Or hopefully not because they have partnered with Strava they just won't do it, period."
fitbit,3cymni,Doceng,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:16:31 2015 UTC,The only difference it makes is the name of the activity in the fitbit dashboard.  Once it syncs to Strava you can edit all the details.

fitbit,3cxxcy,packback,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:47:32 2015 UTC,I guess your band is faulty. Mine is perfectly fine and reads HR quite exact the most time.  Have you considered checking your Charge HR data and compare it with a chest strap or just count the beats per minute?  Also do you wear the band tight enough?
fitbit,3cxxcy,Schnabulation,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:56:48 2015 UTC,I'm having the same problem. I've had my Charge HR for about 30 days and it's not doing HR stuff properly. I'm noticed this especially during activities likes push-ups and pull-ups. I'm going to e mail the company but let me know what you find out.
fitbit,3cxxcy,qwerlkj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"It seems a lot of Charge HR users have major issues with the stability and acuracy of the HRM. How are you wearing it? do you have very hairy arms, tattoos, dark/tanned skin? these are factors that can impact the readings.  There is of course also a chance you got a faulty unit."

fitbit,3cxhuq,istealthbro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"Be careful getting a flex tho - if he wants a surge, he probs wants the screen"
fitbit,3cw01s,IAmYourDad_,3,Sat Jul 11 06:14:24 2015 UTC,Yep. Got it and then disabled the new features. If the Charge HR is querying whether it is being 'raised' to enable it to display the time then it's going to rinse the battery. Same as the way that 'Auto' HR uses more battery than just setting the HR to 'On' - having to query whether the HR needs to be on or off uses a lot of power in a relatively small power pack like this.
fitbit,3cw01s,R961ROP,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure on the ""on"" compared to ""auto"" setting? How many days/hours are we speaking?"
fitbit,3cw01s,Schnabulation,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:02 2015 UTC,Yeo. The 'query' that the device has to do is using battery. Set it to 'On' and the HR will also turn itself off when it detects no activity - but the time between 'queues' is longer and therefore less battery intensive.
fitbit,3cw01s,R961ROP,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:31:39 2015 UTC,Really? This is a nice tipp! Especially since it still turns off when not worn - that's important for me because I don't wear it at night.

fitbit,3ctwgv,Skycakes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"How do I determine what is exercise and what's not? I burn a lot of calories because of my job. A lot of sites list my BMR as being 2031 kcal, and my TDEE is averaging out at around 2890 kcal. So I guess I'm a little confused as to why the number is so high."
fitbit,3ctwgv,IAmCorrectAMA,2,Fri Jul 10 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm  Fitbit uses the Mifflin-St Jeor formula, which is the default for that calculator."
fitbit,3ctwgv,Skycakes,2,Fri Jul 10 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"Well if it's like most sites I've seen it has you put in your body stats, then approximately how much you work out. If you burn a lot of calories on your job then the TDEE from a site that only asks about body stats (to get your BMR) and exercise (to get calories burned from working out) would be missing all of the calories you burn at work."
fitbit,3ctwgv,Skycakes,2,Fri Jul 10 19:46:27 2015 UTC,I got my TDEE for a spreadsheet created by someone over at /r/fitness where it takes how much you've eaten and how much weight you lost and averages it all out.
fitbit,3ctwgv,jtbrown1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:50:02 2015 UTC,Well I'm not sure about a random spreadsheet. What kind of work do you do? 7k is quite a bit but it's not unheard of for athletes in training or someone with a very physical job.

fitbit,3ctwsf,kysr,2,Fri Jul 10 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on what the issue is? I just ordered a Charge HR for my girlfriend and a Surge for myself. I had the Surge when it first came out and they released an update a few weeks later that basically broke it so I returned it, just now getting around to getting back in the game."
fitbit,3ctwsf,AgnewsNews,2,Fri Jul 10 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"The update fails halfway through basically bricking the device.  They haven't fully fixed it yet and have advised people to ask for a new device.  Customer service is log jammed with annoyed customers so are taking 3+ days to respond to emails.  Buy it, just do not update until v85 comes out."
fitbit,3ctwsf,kysr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:22:52 2015 UTC,I'm so glad I forgot to update it at work... I had a really good day today!

Sounds like something similar to what happened to the Surges when they first came out. It baffled me why they couldn't patch the faulty firmware but I spose if it's thoroughly bricked there's no way to patch anymore so the only way to fix is with new devices. Seems like a wasteful and costly mistake on Fitbit's part for not doing proper QA/QC on their software."

fitbit,3ctwsf,floppybutton,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"yeah I get that. I'm not one of those ""I have to have the latest and greatest"" types, nor is my SO. I just wanted to know if Fitbit follows like an annual cycle, say like Apple, and comes out with stuff every August or September. I didn't want to buy the HR next month then find out something else came out that made it drop in value 20%. I'll likely buy the HR soon but since I know nothing about Fitbit I just wanted to find out about its cycles"
fitbit,3ctwsf,werenotwerthy,2,Fri Jul 10 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I bought my Charge HR a couple of months ago and love it. I feel like it has all of the features that I would need from a similar device. I've signed up for Fitbit's beta testing program (along with what I'm sure are billions of other people), to see what their future night look like. I haven't heard anything from them on that line.  I know it's not very helpful of an answer, but from what I can tell there's not a lot to improve upon with this device. It did just come out in the winter, I think, so if they're going to replace it, it won't be soon. Regarding potential obsolescence, however, which features do you think the end user needs that the Charge HR does not have? There may be a different device that includes them today, rather than waiting for the next generation to Fitbit's to hit the market.  Edit: I bought mine through the REI website, but have seen them at Best Buy, Verizon, Target, and other big box retailers since. The price has been static, if got can find a sale go for it, but I paid full price for mine and would be happy to do so again; it was worth every penny."
fitbit,3ctwsf,HolyGigi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"oh, I think the charge HR is great from every review I'm seeing; I can't think of anything specific that I think my SO would think 'oh I need that.' I was worried more from a pricing standpoint, if something came out and the HR would drop significantly from its current price. I'd still buy the HR but I suppose I prefer to buy it for $100 than $150 (hypothetical) :)"

Fibit HR has 2 of those 3 things I wanted.   My only other option was the Jawbone bracelet, but that was more expensive and I liked the Fitbit design more."
fitbit,3ctwsf,odaiwai,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"For the past few years Fitbit has announced a new product in October and it was released in January the following year. The Force was announced in 2013 and released in 2014. The Charge/Hr and Surge was announced in 2014 and released in 2015 (with limited release before that).   Before that Fitbit was a bit more sporadic with their releases, for example the Flex came out in May of 2013.   Is it likely that Fitvit will announce a new tracker this fall? If you look at the last 2 years, then I'd say yes. Is it guaranteed? No.   I have the Charge HR and won't be upgrading to anything new until the wheels fall off this device. I really like it. :)"

fitbit,3cqnr7,TheJorelle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It logs it as an exercise and accounts for the calories burned during said exercise. If you burn 1000 calories biking it will factor that into your deficit, along with your BMR and how much you've eaten that day."

fitbit,3ctg3r,Aliandren,3,Fri Jul 10 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"The flex won't count anything you do on the bike. You have to log the activity by putting your fitbit into activity mode and then changing it on the website later. If you want something to count your cardio based on the effort you are putting in, you have to have something with a HR monitor. None of them will count steps or strokes because you are biking, especially with a recumbent bike. Your calories burned are more likely to be accurate with the HR monitor because fitbit knows close to what you are doing since there are calculations that can figure out energy expenditure based on your heart rate. Otherwise the calculation is just based on your height, weight and sex. They are all good options, it just depends on what you are looking for. Everything tends to overestimate calories and you need to eat at a deficit to lose weight so you need to take some overestimation into account too."

fitbit,3cq1j6,tarots,2,Thu Jul 9 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, despite what others say. You shouldn't eat according to your calories burned on your fitbit. Your best bet is to use an online calculator such as IIFYM or another to calculate your TDEE based on how active you are and eat using that. My Surge tells me I burn 2800+ calories each day, i'm currently bulking and eating 2500 calories whilst gaining weight steadily. I use the calories burned as simply a reference to how much cardio i've done in a day. I think fitbit over estimates this by quite a bit, a quick google reveals many other people with the same issue.

Walk for 2. Etc. It would be nice if it would vibrate notify you. Because trying to see that little clock while running is impossible.   Scrolling text message would be nice too.

I think it could have two types of alarms ""reminder"" and ""wake up"" .. first one would be independent of sleep and the other would try to be smart about sleep patterns and keeping you awake :)  EDIT: maybe ""alarm"" and ""smart alarm"" or something like that would be easy to understand"

fitbit,3cpdij,bigjay1881,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"I've had nothing but problems with the accuracy of the heart rate. To be honest, it only seems accurate if I'm completely still and not moving for some time.  Outside of that, any activity - especially anything with a lot of movement or weight training completely throws it off.  On that note, my charge hr is also terribly inaccurate at counting steps too, so I will likely be returning it for a real fitness watch and go back to using a chest strap for activities that I want to measure calorie burn."
fitbit,3cpdij,ohmyohmyohmyy,2,Thu Jul 9 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"sometimes it looses the reading, but I have to say 99% of the time i check my Surge, it has a reading and not just the ""--"".

You won't have to toggle anything - it'll just know.   I've had mine for a while now and I still notice now and then that the app doesn't show any sleep - if I kill and restart the app and re-sync, it'll show up. I'm not sure what's up with that but it seems to work itself out and doesn't happen too often."
fitbit,3co4ql,2BNamedLater,2,Thu Jul 9 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. Got my charge last night. Wore it to bed and it didn't track anything. This morning I went into the app I chose to manually input my sleep. I just put in the rough hours and magically it brought up my data from the night. Not sure if you'll have the same results. But one can hope!  The odd thing is that the fitbit is supposed to automatically go into sleep mode. So i'm not sure.... But I believe if you hold the button on the fitbit until it vibrates it puts it manually puts it in sleep mode.   I'm going to give mine a change tonight to auto sleep mode. And if that doesn't work, then i'll probably stick with manual!  Hope this helps"
fitbit,3co4ql,CurlyT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"I just got my charge (not HR) as well, and it automatically showed by sleep the first few days but then I had to input my times. I only sync with a computer, because I only have an IPhone 4."
fitbit,3cn2e1,Moussekateer,5,Thu Jul 9 04:34:51 2015 UTC,"Not to be too snarky, but it's likely you'll lose it before two years are up.  My wife is on her third Fitbit (and last, because three strikes and you're out, and the Charge HR doesn't fall off easily like the other Fitbit devices) and I'm on my second.  I've had it since last fall and at least so far it keeps a charge just as well as it used to."
fitbit,3cn2e1,ProjectShamrock,2,Thu Jul 9 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"Haha, I don't want to jinx my luck but my devices tend to last in great condition until the battery dies. Really I just wanted to make sure the Charge HR will last me at least 2 years because I don't want to have to replace it yearly."
fitbit,3cn2e1,hofnbricl,3,Thu Jul 9 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"I'm coming up on a year with my flex and the battery still lasts a week. Most modern batteries are rated to hold 80% off their charge after 500 charge cycles. Since the battery lasts about a week on a charge, those cycles become longer, as opposed to a phone you charge daily. But when the battery dies you'll have to replace the whole unit, it's one piece. The only Fitbit with a replaceable battery is the zip."
fitbit,3cn2e1,boner79,2,Thu Jul 9 11:32:54 2015 UTC,"Forgive my battery ignorance, but does it help with battery longevity to wait to charge it until it's low?  Because right now I charge it daily while I shower but could wait a few days if need be."
fitbit,3cn2e1,hofnbricl,3,Thu Jul 9 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's best if you charge it before it gets under 20%, it's better for the long run. Partial charges are better so charging it daily would be fine, maybe every two days"
fitbit,3cn2e1,AgnewsNews,2,Thu Jul 9 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"Modern batteries such as lithium ion and lithium polymer don't need this as much. Back when batteries were nickel metal hydride they had a ""memory"". So if you only let it drop to 50% and charged it back up enough times you would eventually be left with half capacity. Devices such as phones and I would imagine Fitbit devices as well monitor the current and voltage of the battery constantly to determine the charge left, and shut the device down before any damage can be done to the battery. Still not a bad practice though, I prefer to top off my phone while sitting at my desk then leave it on a charger all night long."
fitbit,3cn2e1,Vurakan,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:49 2015 UTC,I just had my battery start to die on my Fitbit One and I contacted Fitbit Support and it was replaced by them with almost no questions asked and at zero cost.

fitbit,3clmaf,Udderpunch,2,Thu Jul 9 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"I keep it one notch looser than what would feel normal for a regular watch. Doing this helps prevent the rashes I've gotten from the device.

fitbit,3cmwko,Phoenix_risen,2,Thu Jul 9 03:40:48 2015 UTC,"Ok well first things first. You can change the order in which the things are displayed. So you could just set heart rate to be the first that comes up. There's also a tap gesture (double tap the screen) that can be set to display any of the stats as well. For example my trap gesture will show me the time but if I use the button to scroll it will first display heart rate and then go through options from there.   Secondly, I'm not sure what you mean about the screen timing out. As soon as you get to the HR option it should display instantly then about 5 seconds later it will disappear. If it's not displaying HR when you scroll to that option then either he's wearing it wrong (so it's not recognising his HR all the fine) or there's possibly an issue with the device. (For example with mine of I press the button my HR instantly displays, if I scroll through back round to it it will display again and then after about 5 seconds will be gone)"
fitbit,3cmwko,PrinceBert,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:27:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! I'll let him know about being able to change the order of the stats. It seems like he's wearing it too loose then since it takes a few seconds to show the HR.

In the end I canceled my preorder and went for the Charge HR which was a good decision. A friend of mine now has the UP3 and is very diappointed. A lot of features that the previous Jawbone UP24 had are now missing (f.e. powernap).  So I think until Jawbone fixes the UP3 and makes all the sensors available there is no real competition between these too.
fitbit,3chs5b,Schnabulation,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:49:30 2015 UTC,Jawbone lost me too. Their software sounds great. Their wearable- perpetually being recalled. I wish Fibit would incorporate the smarts that jawbone has- like the powernap etc

fitbit,3ciakr,Big9erfan,2,Wed Jul 8 05:25:01 2015 UTC,Why custom zones? Getting your body and heart to a place where they are not working so hard would be a great goal. As you work out it typically takes more and more work to make the same progress. I would recommend against skewing your data.

fitbit,3ch86v,Big9erfan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:26:36 2015 UTC,I bet it'll come. It's a pretty standard idea. They have updated teh Charge HR with other functionality stuff recently and I'm happy about the results.
fitbit,3cgiwp,wyteoliander,2,Tue Jul 7 19:02:12 2015 UTC,"The Charge HR probably estimates the calories you burn primarily with your heart rate and time, but they may use other sensor data to increase the accuracy of the estimate.  You don't need to log individual activities as long as you were wearing the fitbit.  You can use the workout mode to track the data during the time you are working out on your dashboard, but even if you don't use that it will still track your calories."
fitbit,3cgiwp,Doceng,2,Tue Jul 7 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"/u/wyteoliander/  ""Exercise mode"" will give you slightly more accurate calorie burn than the default mode. When in exercise mode, your heart rate is measured every second. When not in exercise mode, it's measured every 5 seconds. For a steady workout (ie: cardio), this would make no difference. For HIIT or weightlifting, you might find some benefits with measurements every second vs every 5 seconds. It's not going to be substantial, but it only requires holding a button for a few seconds, so why not?"

fitbit,3cgiwp,deivijs,3,Tue Jul 7 19:40:03 2015 UTC,Great.  That makes it so much easier.  I think what I have learned so far is 1) I eat too much 2) I didn't work out enough (before)  Sigh.

fitbit,3cgiwp,thedanedame,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"I got a Charge HR too, and I don't trust it one bit.   It's currently 11:28 PM, and it gives me these stats: 23,421 steps 17.3 km walked 4899 kcal burned  The calories burned are impossibly high, seeing how I'm 5'10, 160lbs. Sure, I take a lot of steps due to my work, but that CANNOT account for this crazy amount of burned calories. Seeing how I'm eating around 1600 kcal per day, I should be a skeleton after a month of this work.  Initially I wanted to use to precisely track how much I should be eating, but that idea went out the window as soon as this thing had the audacity to suggest that I burned 5k calories. What the actual fuck. I don't even do side cardio, just medium speed walking at work."
fitbit,3cgiwp,HF2014,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed - mine is equally ridiculous (15K steps of normal walking and it has me down as having burned 3,788 calories, I'm 6'2'' and 236lbs).   It's actually kind of frustrating, especially as I have it all synced to my fitness pal so it's giving me far too high an adjusted budget every day (I tend to just ignore it and stick to my sedentary TDEE)  Anyone have any idea if there are any plans to fix this through a firmware update? Has anyone raised it with Fitbit?"
fitbit,3cgiwp,Schnabulation,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:46:41 2015 UTC,You have to take into consideration that your body is ALWAYS burning calories.  Even while you're sleeping it's burning calories. On a very sedentary day for me I will burn approx 1500 calories. I am 5'2 and 119lbs. You throw 15 000 steps on that and I will easily be above 2500 calories.
fitbit,3cgiwp,ohmyohmyohmyy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:56 2015 UTC,I get that - but I have a sedentary TDEE of around 2400 calories. There's just no way that 15 000 steps burns 1400 calories on top of that TDEE (which presumably includes some steps already).
fitbit,3cgiwp,Schnabulation,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:33:14 2015 UTC,I don't agree with you here. I have nearly the same stats just to speak of and I really trust Fitbit. It takes your heart rate into account. Also you seem to forget how many 15'000 steps are. This is really a lot (in my mind at least).  Also I did some research and I found that normal walking burns quite a bit of calories. So I think it save to asume that the calories count from Fitbit is spot on!

Usually when the audio/notifications stop on the phone its due to another Bluetooth device that has taken control of those settings, but I guess that isn't the case here. Comb through the Bluetooth settings again, try to find any advanced settings. Go through the lockscreen/security settings as well, and the notification settings.

fitbit,3c8251,AusterMcEwan,4,Sun Jul 5 19:47:00 2015 UTC,Can someone elaborate to me how Fitbit and Apple are even competing? Just because they are both wearable tech?
fitbit,3c8251,alosec_,3,Mon Jul 6 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"In the Silicon Valley tech press, Apple is everything.  I even heard a reporter say (not kidding) ""I don't see why anybody would ever buy a Fitbit after the Apple Watch comes out"".  They really aren't competing, hardly at all.  I see Fitbit excelling in the lower priced fitness trackers (One, Flex, Charge), and maybe not so much at the Surge level (but I could be wrong).  Fitbits pretty much do one thing (fitness tracking) well, and not much else.  I also don't see much competition between a device that costs between $90-170 and something that starts at nearly $400."
fitbit,3c8251,WIlf_Brim,2,Mon Jul 6 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"I think your analysis is spot on, and that's the problem for Fitbit. Speculation follows here: The customers that spend $90-170 only just aren't worth as much - ideally they can upsell them a second device - but everyone wants the $400 customers who are more likely to buy apps/subscriptions/etc. The Surge is an attempt to capture a little bit of that market, and I'm still expecting an improved 'premium' offering before long.  If you sell someone a Zip, they're probably set and don't need to buy anything else. That's no good. If Apple win that battle for the higher value market segment, that's trouble for Fitbit's future growth."
fitbit,3c8251,sodiumlaurethsulfate,3,Mon Jul 6 08:54:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand it either. There is a difference between a ""fitness tracker"" and a ""smart watch"". The Fitbit Surge is first and foremost a fitness tracker (and at least for me) does it's job well. The Apple Watch is a smart watch with a bunch of features and a color screen, but it's fitness tracking capabilities I've heard are not that great. It excels in the category of a smart watch. So, for me, they are two different product categories."
fitbit,3c8251,PammyLZ,2,Mon Jul 6 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"Right. They are on totally different planes. To me, it's comparing a bike and a car."
fitbit,3c8251,alosec_,2,Mon Jul 6 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"Simply put, if someone spends 150 on a fitbit they're probably not going to spend 350 on an Apple watch as well or vise versa."
fitbit,3c8251,PacMann_,3,Mon Jul 6 00:57:57 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, but the person who spends $150 on a Fitbit is not the person that is looking for the features of the $350 Apple Watch. The person that spends $150 on a Fitbit is looking for the features of a fitness tracker, not a smart watch. They have very different capabilities, and should be treated as non-competitors, even if some features overlap."
fitbit,3c8251,alosec_,2,Mon Jul 6 03:20:55 2015 UTC,I sure hope Fitbit sticks around and improves. I want something I can use a for a few days+ without recharging. It needs to work with Android. It needs to be lightweight.   Fitbit needs to improve the comfort of their bands and fix a few things but as of right now it's Apple which is the one playing catch-up.
fitbit,3c8251,NewOnX,2,Mon Jul 6 01:10:49 2015 UTC,"Afaik Fitbits work with Android? My charge Hr lasts for 5 days or so without charging, I don't know what it's like with the surge."
fitbit,3c8251,elizabethan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that if the Apple watch won't work with Android phones it's useless so Fitbit has a natural leg up."

fitbit,3c8251,alosec_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's funny that there is a thought that smart watches will kill fitness trackers. I own and wear simultaneously the Moto 360 and Charge HR. But I don't wear the 360 to the gym. I feel like I'd smash it accidentally at the gym, while the Charge HR seems much more sturdy.  Not to mention that I don't trust the 360's fitness tracking worth shit."
fitbit,3c8251,SharksFan4Lifee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:43:43 2015 UTC,I'm not interested in smart watches but they are definitely competitors. You only have so much room on your wrist and I doubt most people would go for more than one device. If the apple watch is 'good enough' at fitness tracking that will do for most people and they're less likely to go and buy a fitbit.

fitbit,3c7vbj,tuffsmudgecat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:35:59 2015 UTC,I would suggest to keep the one together with the Charge HR. The app is multi-tracker compatible so you can wear the Charge HR if you want and switch to the One when you need to wear a suit.
fitbit,3c7vbj,Schnabulation,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:18:53 2015 UTC,That was my plan! I'm so glad I have the option to switch between the two when the charge isn't right for the day's outfit!

fitbit,3c7vbj,Schnabulation,2,Sun Jul 5 23:10:34 2015 UTC,I read a lot of revies about the UP3. I even pre-ordered the UP3. But canceled and went for the Charge HR. This was a good decision. A friend of mine upgraded from the UP24 to the UP3 and is very disappointed. It seems that the software of the UP3 is not developed to the point where it can make use of all the sensors yet. So the Charge HR is the better tracker at the moment.

fitbit,3c9ed7,RomaNorgy,2,Mon Jul 6 06:04:39 2015 UTC,"That makes sense - there's not only different formulae for men and women, but it'll be using the height/age data for your husband too. They generally estimate water weight by working off your height, impedance and a bunch of other factors. It's a pretty good guess but not perfect.  It's good to go off trend and try and measure at the same time of day/hydration level/etc.  BTW, I don't have an Aria, but I think there's a regular/lean setting somewhere, I've seen a couple of posts from women who found changing that got them more realistic results."

fitbit,3c9ed7,Schnabulation,2,Mon Jul 6 11:20:00 2015 UTC,What /u/sodiumlaurethsulfate wrote still applies! A woman has more bodyfat around the waist than a man. Furthermore be informed that the body fat measurement that Aria does is not very accurate. It's ok as a trend but if you want accurate body fat percentage try a caliper. Even your hand held device measures body fat using current. So your hand held device will mostly measure the body fat around your upper body while Aria will measure the body fat around your lower body - can be different!  Use the percentage as a trend - that's what I do.

fitbit,3c4u1s,Salt-y,2,Sat Jul 4 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"ok cool. Yea my issue is basically, I was trying to figure out if it syncs with myfitnesspal without having an ""exercise session."" Like say I just put on my watch in the morning, wear it while walking around town for 20 miles, not technically exercise, but still burning a lot of calories. It won't sync up those calories burned right? Because I didn't technically ""start an exercise"" on the fitbit. That's what i'm trying to figure out."
fitbit,3c4u1s,IAmCorrectAMA,3,Sat Jul 4 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"The Fitbit should send all calories burned over your BMR to MFP, even if you don't ""track exercise"". At least it does for me...

fitbit,3c4u1s,WIlf_Brim,2,Sat Jul 4 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"MFP will add extra calories based upon what you said your baseline activity level was, and how many steps you took.  MFP assumes that you will take a given number of steps (say, 6000).  If you take 10,000 it will credit additional calories for those 4,000.  There is an option in MFP where if you do not meet however many steps you are supposed to take it will subtract from you calorie allowance."
fitbit,3c4u1s,Big9erfan,2,Sun Jul 5 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Fitbit won't sync the exercise over, in so much that you'll see the exercise in mfp as well, instead it just syncs over the calories for the day (which are included in the exercise you did)"
fitbit,3c4u1s,idkmybffjll,2,Sun Jul 5 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"To clarify, mfp doesn't count steps. Mfp estimates your TDEE. Fitbit claims to estimate a more accurate calorie burn based on steps/activity.

Furthermore weight training: the Charge HR has a very hard time reading the pulse when doing weight lifting. So the calories are not calculated very accurately while working out - sadly."
fitbit,3c4bgn,adaliss,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:39:30 2015 UTC,"Well for swimming, the HR wouldn't help any differently, but the heart rate monitor should make it more accurate in general.

I've found if you go into the day and pick a food and just scroll through the serving size you ate and put it back to your original it will update correctly for awhile. I've been logging everything under the ""anytime"" feature so I have the accurate count on the section even if it shows up wrong on the graph."
fitbit,3c1rpy,HarterTwins,2,Sat Jul 4 01:29:20 2015 UTC,I've noticed this from time to time as well. Whenever I reboot my phone it fixes the issue
fitbit,3c1rpy,jstar02,2,Sat Jul 4 01:59:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. Mine isn't being added correctly. Yesterday lunch was 700 and dinner was 800 and I had two other entries but my total for the day was listed as 1300. Makes nonsense.

fitbit,3c1fp0,BottomoftheFifth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:46:22 2015 UTC,I find that my charge hr causes a rash if I am really sweaty and don't dry it off quickly or if I get it wet and don't dry it.

She really wanted to like the new Fitbit(s) but with all the problems and their lack of urgency around finding a solution seems lack a bad way to run a business.

On pc both choices lead me to this new blank account I created (login with Facebook and actually logging in) I can't even seem to find my tracker that is connected to my app. I'll try logging in on mobile and see what happens.    I see that I can export data.  Would be nice if I could just import data into the new account. But since I'm having trouble even getting to the current data that probably wouldn't help right now.
fitbit,3bzy1n,jamie31882,7,Fri Jul 3 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"depending on your body stats, that is most likely your BMR calorie burn. so the amount you use just being alive. everyone gets their BMR like that on a new fitbit, and you can't reset it"

fitbit,3bzy1n,Doceng,3,Fri Jul 3 15:27:26 2015 UTC,That is the Fitbit estimating your caloric expenditure based on you height and weight with no activity called your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).  I'm not sure why but it fills the data in previous to when you register a tracker.  I started using my Charge HR on the 29th and it filled in my BMR for the whole month.
fitbit,3bzy1n,CaptainCapybara,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"Based on the weight, height, and gender you told Fitbit, that's the estimate of how much you burn daily just by being alive. If you ate that many calories daily without burning more through activity, you'd maintain your current weight."
fitbit,3bzy1n,unreqistered,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:45:11 2015 UTC,Your BMR.  A better estimate of your daily needs is TDEE.  http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html

fitbit,3bxu76,CSnarf,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"Also left handed, wear mine on my left mainly because i wear my real watch on my right hand.  I find it's always gonna over count some steps no matter which hand you wear it on, but what's important is the treads. If you do 25k steps in a day and its over counted 300-500 steps it's not a huge contribution to your daily goal.  In saying that I don't think it will effect your steps that much if you're using a mouse, when i write it doesn't count steps only when I'm moving my hand violently like brushing my teeth"

fitbit,3bwq6w,AtomikRadio,5,Thu Jul 2 19:55:37 2015 UTC,Can be from water getting underneath the band and sitting for too long causing irritation.  Could also be if you haven't (or don't) clean the band regularly (https://www.fitbit.com/productcare).  Hope that helps.
fitbit,3bwq6w,Big9erfan,5,Thu Jul 2 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like the beginnings of a pressure sore to me. Try wearing your watch a little looser (At least for a few days while it heals). I know that the manual recommends otherwise, but your wrist will definitely thank you for it."
fitbit,3bwq6w,reawaken29,3,Thu Jul 2 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"I get that around where the buckle sits on me.  It got bad enough I wore a band-aid over it a few days while it healed up.  It started to come back, but I've been able to keep it from getting bad again by taking it off and making sure the skin and the band are really clean.  I also find it helps if I take it off for a few hours at least every few days, or sleep without it one or 2 nights a week.  Sure, you don't get sleep tracking if you do that, but for me that's not a big deal and it's better than that annoying rash coming back.  I swear sometimes I can feel it trying to form, I get this warm feeling, not quite a burning sensation, that starts especially if I am really active and sweaty.  I also shave my wrist a little so the little security band doesn't pinch my arm hair when I'm adjusting my wristband."

fitbit,3bwq6w,rationalphi,2,Fri Jul 3 01:06:12 2015 UTC,Looks like you have it a bit tight.  You may also want to take an old toothbrush and brush the interior every day or two to clean out the crevices where dead skin accumulates.

fitbit,3bxoiy,allaphoristic,2,Fri Jul 3 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yes they should. If you bought it recently, though, and need it replaced with the Target not too far you could maybe replace it there."

fitbit,3bxoiy,Big9erfan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"Yes they do. They do like you to have your receipt the first time you call them/email them for a replacement, but even if you don't they make sure the tracker hasn't been registered under another account before and then they'll help you.

fitbit,3bvh12,Namick1894,2,Thu Jul 2 15:36:52 2015 UTC,Thank you - I think this is the problem. Can you tell me how the unpairing process works? Do I have to do this in the app or in the device settings?
fitbit,3bvh12,Namick1894,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"Go to the Bluetooth settings on the original phone, then click on the charge pairing for options.  Then just hit the unpair option.  This is all on the original phone, so you would need to get in contact with the seller.  Good luck!"
fitbit,3bvh12,Big9erfan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"What model iPhone do you have?  The flex will NOT show up in the bluetooth device list, that's not ""how it works"".  It should show up in the app.  If it's not, then have you tried sycning it with your computer?  Hopefully the seller provided the usb dongle and then you can download the Fitbit computer application and see if that helps at all."
fitbit,3bvh12,Big9erfan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, I got the dongle. Sadly it does not work with it either.  Are you sure the device is not shown under bluetooth devices? Because my Charge HR does so..."
fitbit,3bvh12,Austintatious_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I am sure.  I have a flex as well (as does my wife).  The Charge HR shows up under Bluetooth devices as it connects to alert you to phone calls (and caller ID), the flex has no such capability (also, since you didn't mention the model of the phone, but you have a working Charge HR, then you have a model that supports BLE so that rules that part out :) ).  It sounds like it broke.  You said the seller said it worked fine until they stopped using it, do you know the seller outside of this transaction?  If so, they can contact support and have it swapped out for you.  I'm not sure how well Fitbit will support a device that is on it's second (or later) owner."

fitbit,3bvmo7,whoadude95,3,Thu Jul 2 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"Track your HR over a longer period of time, sometimes the first readings aren't quite accurate. Past that, consider consulting a doctor if you can't bring it down with regular exercise."
fitbit,3bvmo7,alosec_,2,Thu Jul 2 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"Will do. Coincidentally I was just at the doctor's office last week for a routine physical exam and everything was ship-shape. Starting to doubt the Charge HR's heart rate monitor, but I will reserve judgement until I've had it on for at least another couple weeks. Thanks, by the way!"
fitbit,3bvmo7,Crabrubber,2,Thu Jul 2 15:02:16 2015 UTC,I've tested my Charge HR against a chest strap heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor with pulse display and the HR was within 3bpm to both.  Do you live somewhere warm? I've had my HR since December and my resting heart rate is 5-10 bpm higher this summer than it was during the winter.
fitbit,3bvmo7,sonic_harmonic,2,Thu Jul 2 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"I've done this as well. The only time I've noticed a difference is when your arm is exceptionally sweaty. I've seen it read double your actual heart rate, or just doesn't read at all :/ Understandable I guess."
fitbit,3bvmo7,sc300jz,3,Thu Jul 2 21:16:45 2015 UTC,Everyone's resting HR is different. As a nurse I see variety of pt and how they're blood pressure /HR is. I see some of their baseline is 50s or even 90s and thats normal for them. If your HR has always been 75-85 then thats normal for yourself.  Most likely you have nothing to worry about.
fitbit,3bvmo7,Doceng,2,Fri Jul 3 06:41:28 2015 UTC,This exactly!    /u/whoadude95 : Being fit doesn't guarantee a low resting heart rate and resting heart rate rises quickly when you decrease your level of activity.  Even if your resting heart rate was low when you were running cross country if your activity level is less than before it's not surprising that your resting heart rate would increase.  The Charge HR has been shown to be pretty accurate when used properly so you should give it some more time before deciding the device is at fault.
fitbit,3bvmo7,catheriya,2,Fri Jul 3 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"I feel my resting HR is a bit high also.  I'm 33 y.o., 5'5, 127lbs, fit.  I run 20-30+ miles a week and am training for a marathon, I yoga, walk 5+ miles every day.  I only drink coffee on the weekend and my diet is fairly healthy.  I've been to my doctor recently before I got a Fitbit HR and my blood work came back incredibly healthy according to my doctor.  My resting HR is around 69-70 according to Fitbit.  I have no idea how to check for accuracy.  What's weird is that whenever I've been sitting for an extended period of time at work, I check my HR and it's usually between 55-67.  I know Fitbit HR data is 5 mins delay but still."
fitbit,3bvmo7,Big9erfan,2,Thu Jul 2 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"That is odd. I've read other posts where people complain that the Charge HR is consistently off when it comes to heart rate, which is sad when the whole point of paying 20 more dollars for it is for heart rate monitoring. Anyway, I'd say to keep an eye on it for another few weeks just to see if it doesn't even out"
fitbit,3bvmo7,left_write,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:11:54 2015 UTC,Could be wearing the device too tightly.  That will constrict your blood vessels more and cause higher readings.
fitbit,3bvmo7,sonic_harmonic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"I've also considered this explanation. I have this red cloth bracelet tied around that wrist (right at the wrist bone area) that I can't take off without offending her, even though it also probably constricts my wrist too much. Also, because of this I need to wear my fitbit higher up on my wrist, further worsening the problem. Eh, whatever."

It seems like I only really commit to stuff if I'm invest money in it and there's a risk of wasting my money. It's a problem but it's better to acknowledge and work on your problems right?
fitbit,3bri1i,steenacakez,4,Wed Jul 1 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"I've found participating in challenges to be a great motivator.   If you're into monetary incentives, you might wanna check out the Pact App. (Personally, I haven't tried it but heard about it recently.)"
fitbit,3bri1i,RomaNorgy,13,Wed Jul 1 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"For me some of the benefits were surprising.   When it's dark and I go to the bathroom I can just double tap on my fitbit and I have a night light instead of turning on super bright lights. Sometimes when I want to make a decision fast but I'm not sure what way to lean, I'll just check my calories burned or step counter, and use odd numbers for ""yes"" and even numbers for ""no."" This can help me spend more time doing and less time deliberating, randomize my decisions on unimportant things, and add variety to my life by causing me to try things I normally wouldn't. I've only had my charge HR for a week, but tracking my sleep and noticing how rested I feel each day is really helping me figure out how much sleep my body actually needs. I also don't have to try and remember what time I fell asleep last night when I wake up a few hours early and can either try to drift back to sleep or start my day early. It incentivizes being active in strange ways. I never would have considered a trip to Home Depot for its caloric burn, but with giant department stores you end up walking around a lot to find everything. Now I'm more likely to join my girlfriend on errands that involve a lot of walking since all those steps get recorded and now add an extra dimension of value to otherwise mundane tasks."
fitbit,3bri1i,micwillia,5,Wed Jul 1 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say that my Fitbit has improved my life but, it has certainly made me more aware of how to treat my body right. I use MyFitnessPal to track food intake and to have all of the data sync and give numbers to it is a great perk. It won't be a cure all device but, may give you the motivation to get out and be active.   You will also be happy about paying up to get the watch on it. I originally had the flex, then bought the force, after returning to the flex (force recall) and not having a display of your stats and the time was extremely annoying."

I definitely drink enough water, and then some each day now.  Some things to work on:   Food in take vs how much energy I expend each day (trying to lose weight here as well as be more active again, and to learn to be healthy SLEEP!

Desk job and mindless eating were killing me. Now this little band on my wrist makes me want to move more, and the app logs my food and sleep. My swimming workouts are better because I want to push myself, and I'm going for walks which I used to HATE doing before.  I would think, ""I'm swimming, I eat ok, why am I not losing any weight?""

Like for example I'll park farther away from the store so I can get some extra steps in towards my goal. It makes weight loss and exercise more like a game, especially if you add friends to compete with. That extra motivation is awesome and I wish I would have gotten a fitbit months ago when I first saw them."

Lost 40 in early 2014, gained 20 back over the next 6 months by going back to poor diet and exercise habits. Lost another 25-30 this spring. Each time i need to cut, Fitbit helps by showing me a fairly accurate count of how much I am burning per day so i can adjust my intake accordingly. I won't give Fitbit all the credit, I used MFP as well, and these are just tools. I actually had to do the work myself. The tools help make things easier and more efficient  but they are not the cause for hitting my goals. If anyone out there thinks Fitbit is the solution to their problems, think again. It can be a great motivator and can greatly assist you if you take advantage of the information it gives you. But it is work..."

Sleep, steps, cals, floors climbed, it has the caller ID function too, but I don't really use this often.   As far as the heart rate thing is concerned, I have a naturally low blood pressure and heart rate, and the Fitbit would just think I was dying all the time. Im also on a few different meds that spike it in the morning, and lower it at night so I just didn't want my exercise tool bitching at me when I'm actually pretty healthy in all other regards. Lol.

The 10k daily goal is awesome because it really motivates me to keep moving! Even if I'm not necessarily going to the gym to exercise, the goal helps me to at least find ways to get up and walk around.

fitbit,3bvqlv,IAmCorrectAMA,3,Thu Jul 2 17:08:48 2015 UTC,LOL
fitbit,3bvqlv,orangutan9,-1,Thu Jul 2 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think that's a silly reason to return it, BUT I get it.  He's not wrong.  The data is all there, they are just locking what could be free features behind a paywall.  Now, the fact that you pay once for a Fitbit, and get lifetime app support is cool.  So, I could argue that if they just charged everyone $10 a year to cover their development and server costs, and it included all features, it'd be cool.  The thing is, with the $50 for premium, they are basically using those people to subsidize all of us free users.  Maintaining that app, adding features, and hosting the data is not free."
fitbit,3bvqlv,Tex-Rob,3,Thu Jul 2 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"The data is all there, they are just locking what could be free features behind a paywall.   Using this train of thought, everything digital should be free. Should musicians just release all of their music for free too? Should Consumer Reports release all of its data for free? It's already there...little to no cost to send to whoever wants it. Why not just release it to everybody?  The reports and charts that Fitbit provides didn't just appear out of thin air. They aren't just ""there"". They require time and money to design and develop and will continue to require time and money to maintain. If Fitbit thinks that it is valuable enough to sell, then they charge money and customers will pay for it. If customers don't find value, they'll pack their bags and find a better alternative. That's the beauty of competition.  It's perfectly acceptable for somebody to say something is not worth spending money on, but it is wrong to say that it ""should be free because it's already there""."
fitbit,3bvqlv,IAmCorrectAMA,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:07:49 2015 UTC,Your argument lost me at the first line.  Your analogies are not even close to the same thing.
fitbit,3bu7s7,blackcomedy,2,Thu Jul 2 04:47:41 2015 UTC,The flex is a relatively older model of fitbut. A great model but there are definitely newer ones.   The Charge  The Charge HR   The Surge  I have the Charge HR and I love it.
fitbit,3bu7s7,catskulls,2,Thu Jul 2 13:50:13 2015 UTC,"i don't like the look of them unfortunately. i'm probably the odd one out considering i don't want a display. the more minimal for me, the better."
fitbit,3bu7s7,usernameismyrealname,0,Thu Jul 2 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"Flex is rarely a good idea.  No display (defeats the purpose of a fitness tracker IMO) and the band is crap, I hear from people who have lost these all the time and have even found them in my neighborhood after they have obviously fallen off."
fitbit,3bu7s7,autopilot638,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"That's quite the statement - just because the Flex doesn't fit your lifestyle does not mean that it's a bad buy for everyone else.  I chose my Flex over the Charge HR as I could continue to wear it in the pool. I love the slim band design and the fact that you can buy alternative bands for it. I have no complaints to date about the fastener.  While I may upgrade in the future for floors and HR, I consider it a great buy."
fitbit,3bu7s7,usernameismyrealname,0,Sat Jul 4 13:03:04 2015 UTC,"That's quite the statement - just because the Flex doesn't fit your lifestyle does not mean that it's a bad buy for everyone else.    I sell these professionally.  I would guess that I get a lot more feedback on people who use it on a day to day basis than you do.  I started with no prejudices but after hearing from so many people who either lost them due to the poor band or who ultimately decided they wanted a display (or floors), I have realized based on spending hours a day hearing about the needs of my customers that there are very few people who would actually be appropriately served by these.  Additionally, I have worked directly with FitBit employees who have expressed the same opinion, and mentioned their sales numbers for this one (particularly when stacked against others), and have expressed wanting to get rid of it altogether for the reasons I mentioned.  Are there certain people they may work for?  Of course.  There's a buyer out there for every product.  Does it make sense for the vast majority of people who are interested in a FitBit fitness tracker?  Not the ones I work with on a daily basis, it doesn't seem to."
fitbit,3bu7s7,CalciferHeart,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:23:44 2015 UTC,i actually don't want a display and anything is better than the clip on style i used to use. i had a jawbone clip that worked wonders but eventually i lost it while bending over to get something at ikea. i feel like if it was on my wrist i would've noticed it missing a lot quicker than i noticed it missing from my jeans.

fitbit,3bt4yv,miniclubbin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:09:09 2015 UTC,This is a common problem with weight training. The PurePulse HR sensor has a problem determining the heart rate when there is muscle activity in the forearm. I have a Charge HR and it gives wrong readings when doing CrossFit or other weight lifting training.  There is actually nothing you can do. I tried everything. It's the sensor technology.
fitbit,3bt4yv,Schnabulation,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"I also get the ""--"" sometimes, it lasts a few seconds and the it just picks up where it left. Don't really know why yours starts at a lower BPM and the climbs to the correct level.  It does have som lag when my HR rises/falls rapidly (like when I'm lifting), but even then, if it registered for example 150 BPM when it lost track, it usually picks up +/- 20 BPM."

fitbit,3brzkw,AlreadyThrownAway33W,2,Thu Jul 2 01:26:04 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, my calorie exp. definitely seems higher with the past few days of ~30 degrees. Heart rate/resting hr has gone up a few beats too."
fitbit,3bqhfh,ocelotspleen,2,Wed Jul 1 09:22:56 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to know without knowing your weight and height.   Based on the data from this post with your 5 hours of walking and assuming you slept for 8 you should have burnt roughly 1.7-1.9x your BMR that day. So that does feel a bit high unless your BMR is ~3K.   Theoretically the Charge HR should be pretty accurate as it uses heart rate to calculate burn but mine also feels consistently high (I have a BMR of 1.9K and on a moderately active day (16K steps) it thinks I burned 4,400 calories) so I tend to assume it overestimates... Whatever you do don't eat back all of those calories thinking you'll still be at a deficit."
fitbit,3bqhfh,HF2014,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:39:03 2015 UTC,absolutely not accurate
fitbit,3bqhfh,kwunyurn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:49:48 2015 UTC,What is your reasoning if I might ask? Do you feel the calories burned should be higher or lower?   Calories burned is shown for the whole day and included calories burned by just existing. At my weight and heart rate  (according to Fitbit) I burn 3k calories in a day after walking only 4 miles. Am I missing something here?
fitbit,3bqhfh,Lariael,0,Wed Jul 1 15:38:18 2015 UTC,Am I missing something here?   Yeah. The environmental temp alters heat transfer from your body to the environment. Heart rate ins't an indicator. Calories burned has always been the least precise measurement of fitness devices.

fitbit,3bmcb1,Skycakes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:26:51 2015 UTC,"They calculate it by adding your BMR (the calories you burn just breathing, repairing cells, etc.) with the calories you burn walking around and doing exercise. I honestly think the number is a bit high. I would just eat like you usually do unless you have specific body composition goals in mind."
fitbit,3bmcb1,Skycakes,2,Tue Jun 30 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"I'd like to slim down a little, so I already eat accordingly. I just don't get how the rest of the goals (active minutes, steps, and to a lesser extent distance) are achievable but calories burned is hard to reach. It requires me reaching 14-15k steps a day which doesn't happen a lot."
fitbit,3bowdv,ratkutti,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"You adjusted your goal to be 7000 rather than 10,000 steps (the default) -- did you also adjust the distance goal to be correspondingly lower? You might want to do that."
fitbit,3bowdv,andrea789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"I have it at 6000. And I am not sure if my distance goal matches my step goal, have to check it out. Thanks!"

fitbit,3bh2gt,Analytical_Chemist,3,Mon Jun 29 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"No, it gives you a boost for being in the fat burning zone. Your resting heart rate is not good, if you're fit and in a normal/healthy bmi range, the heart rate sensor could be broken. If you're unfit and overweight, your heart will have to work harder (more beats per minute). Consult a doctor and check your vitals, change your lifestyle (food/drinks and exercise).  Under settings in the Fitbit app, you can turn off or modify the heart rate zones. I would advise you to do that to get a better result. Just sitting with minimal movement will burn, on average, 85kcal/h."

The problem with this, I guess, is you're not ""truly"" at rest - you're awake, probably slightly stressed because you're in your doctors office, you've probably recently either been driving or walking to the doctors office so that will have got your heart rate up etc.  The way fitness trackers measure your RHR is by taking a reading while you're asleep. This obviously has the advantages of you being (presumably) at your most restful state. The disadvantage seems to be that it's a fairly new/non-standard method and so normal charts for measuring RHR don't really take this into account yet."
fitbit,3bgiu5,DrSecretan,2,Mon Jun 29 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Totally possible and a great number of you are a fit person.   Long before fitbits existed, you could get your resting heart rate from a heart rate monitor, testing in the first few minutes of being awake, before you sat up, talked, etc.   The upper forties/lower 50s would be pretty good but standard for a fit runner-type person."
fitbit,3bgiu5,Pamzella,2,Mon Jun 29 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible.  I have a resting heart rate in the 50s (24f), but regularly go into the 40s when I sleep. If you are more fit than me, your heart rate is going to be lower, so I definitely think that is possible."
fitbit,3bgiu5,thisisultimate,2,Mon Jun 29 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"Mine so far is pretty accurate.  My heart rate strap, when sitting just before a workout, typically is in the 50s, going as low as 47 (lowest I ever saw was 43 on my Garmin back in 2007!).  My Charge has me at 61 for today.    I also watched my heart rate on the Charge today vs what a strap was reporting, and it was typically within a few beats.  The instructions say to wear it an inch or so above the actual wrist, light enough that it can move a little.  If you're doing that, you're probably getting a decent reading.  From what I have read, the accuracy is decent, but not as accurate as a strap, though the straps are pretty uncomfortable (and impractical) to wear all day."

Remember, general maintenance of your body takes energy in the form of calories, then any calories that you burn during exercise is added on. There are calorie calculators that can tell you how many calories you should be burning on a daily basis. Also, the bigger you are, the more energy it takes to perform an action, so it's entirely possible that you actually did burn all of those calories."

fitbit,3bdf5s,slmcg14,6,Sun Jun 28 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"I have one and I do enjoy having it, but I don't know if everyone would consider it worth the cost. It's just a scale with a bioelectrical impedance analysis feature to estimate your body fat percentage. Like all BIA devices it is not completely accurate and can vary a lot based on things like hydration status. So really it's just a scale you're paying more for to have it sync easily with your Fitbit account and MFP. You could get teh same information from a cheaper scale, you just wouldn't be able to sync as easily. (I know my previous scale synced with MFP wirelessly as well, but I'm not sure if it would have synced with Fitbit via MFP since I didn't use it at the time.)"
fitbit,3bdf5s,AtomikRadio,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:20:18 2015 UTC,Excellent - thanks so much for your reply!  I'll ask around if anyone has managed to go scale -> MFP -> fitbit. If it is super easy I might just go the cheaper option but if it is a pain then I might consider investing!
fitbit,3bdf5s,aaksut79,3,Sun Jun 28 04:38:56 2015 UTC,"I have one and have it connected to the same account as my charge HR and the account is connected to MFP and the weight updates there as well. I think the long term tracking is invaluable and if you weigh yourself every day and can see the trends over time you are far less likely to let yourself go.  I also have it connected to a site called trendweight which is great as it averages out your daily spikes which really helps you get back on track after a bad weekend or whatever. Here's ~18 months worth of data for me. Way better than the fitbit or MFP weight chart.  https://trendweight.com/u/e02c9f56d7b147/  I don't find the body fat stuff particularly useful, it is very dependent on diet, ie low carb you retain less water and get a higher body fat reading. If you eat a bunch of carbs and retain more water your body fat % goes down. So having a binge on carbs makes your bf % go down for a few days when in actual fact it's probably gone up slightly! It's something to be aware of."
fitbit,3bdf5s,davidmcw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:24:45 2015 UTC,Wow this trendweight site looks amazing! Thank you for showing me!   I think I will just invest - if I can get a trend like that it is more than worth it in my eyes!
fitbit,3bdf5s,mikero,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"Cool site, thanks for sharing"
fitbit,3bdf5s,CPHBOSDCA,2,Mon Jun 29 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Ive got it and I love it. Weigh myself every morning. Syncs perfectly and data appears in the app. Body fat percentage varies in accuracy but you can see yourself getting leaner over time or vice versa with the app. Worth it in my opinion
fitbit,3bdf5s,Bonxy,2,Sun Jun 28 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"My family uses the Aria scale and we really like it. That said, we got it with a 20% off coupon at Bed Bath & Beyond, and if we hadn't had the coupon I don't think we would have invested. I love how it automatically syncs with Fitbit, though!"

fitbit,3bbfwy,Grippler,2,Sat Jun 27 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"I've had 3 total, 2 were replacements and they're actually sending me my 3 replacement today and I bought the original less than 5 months ago.   1st: Lasted about 30 days. I put it on charge before bed, woke up and it was off, never to turn on again.   2nd: Lasted around 2 months and the touch screen stopped working. Would work again if you reset it & then the same issue would occur again. This is a known issue with the surge.   3rd: Current replacement, at this time I'm over the surge. I barely have used it as it's more of a hassle than anything. It's usually just sitting on my desk. Anyways, I took a shower and the inside of the glass steamed up making it impossible to see the digitizer. This clears up as the steam eventually makes its way out.   For the price of this watch I find it extremely inconvenient that I've had this many issues with it, I do not find this product reliable & as soon as I get the replacement in the mail, I'm going to sell it and be done with fitbit until they come out with a better watch."

fitbit,3b8zux,thirddayiii,5,Fri Jun 26 23:12:51 2015 UTC,You can select any fitbit you have but I was very excited about the new HR features. Just in case anyone wanted to know all the new stuff. Best one for me is simply holding wrist up and seeing the time.
fitbit,3b8zux,boner79,5,Fri Jun 26 23:14:57 2015 UTC,I too just discovered the wrist twist clock and it made my day.
fitbit,3b8zux,skippgil,3,Sat Jun 27 00:02:27 2015 UTC,Love this feature! Would really like if they implemented some type f stopwatch feature as well.
fitbit,3b8zux,procrastinator7,2,Sat Jun 27 02:44:39 2015 UTC,There is a stopwatch!! Just hold down the side button and it activates the stopwatch.

fitbit,3b8zux,procrastinator7,2,Sat Jun 27 06:57:49 2015 UTC,you're welcome :) I enjoy that feature
fitbit,3b8zux,skippgil,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:20:18 2015 UTC,"Isn't that just the fitness tracker? I use that to monitor when I'm active. The timer unfortunately disappears after a few seconds and I have to keep pressing the button to see the time.   I would like there to be an option to have the stopwatch continuously display so I can take a pulse, for example, which requires about 30 seconds of time."
fitbit,3b8zux,procrastinator7,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:37:54 2015 UTC,"Funny you say that because that's exactly what I need it for as well (taking pulses and respirations). After reading some more, yes I guess that is the fitness tracker. I didn't realize that. However, if you need a timer for a few minutes, it works just fine for that. Of course the screen does turn off so that is annoying but it's better than nothing."
fitbit,3b8zux,tea_and_honey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:41:25 2015 UTC,So this is why the display keeps coming on?  I was at the movies last night and could not figure out why it kept lighting up!  It's very distracting :(  I was worried the update had broken something.
fitbit,3b8zux,not_vicky,3,Sat Jun 27 13:11:47 2015 UTC,Mine got stuck in the middle so I tried again.  It didn't work.  Synced it and tried again.  Wouldn't work.

fitbit,3b9q93,scyiia,2,Sat Jun 27 06:05:11 2015 UTC,I went through customer support and they sent out a new one free same day.

fitbit,3b9q93,maxkennedy99,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:18:59 2015 UTC,No but I had what was probably water damage and they got me on the line with customer service and talked me through to repair it and it didn't get fixed so they said they'll send me one free even though I didn't buy it through them or have a receipt but they saw i had one registered to an account so they knew I wasn't lying. But yeah just go through customer service and who knows you might be able to repair it!

fitbit,3bac4c,elizabethan,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"""bumping"" doesn't work on reddit like it does on forums, just fyi."
fitbit,3b9ovt,vilemuse,11,Sat Jun 27 03:12:59 2015 UTC,"Fitbit is pretty explicit about it.   All Fitbit trackers are water-resistant, which means they are rain-proof and splash-proof and can stand up to even the sweatiest workout.  Do not swim with your tracker. We also don't recommend showering with your tracker; though the water won't hurt the device, wearing it 24/7 does not give your skin a chance to breathe. Whenever you get your tracker wet, dry it thoroughly before putting it back on.  Fitbit Surge is water resistant to 5 ATM, or 50 meters, and Fitbit Charge HR is water resistant to 1 ATM, or 10 meters. This means the trackers can be submerged and will still work when removed from the water. However, this does not mean the trackers can withstand the force associated with swimming strokes, so as mentioned previously we don't recommend swimming with the trackers."
fitbit,3b9ovt,Faitmaker,2,Sat Jun 27 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"I bought a Flex specifically because I swim. I've had it since Monday, wearing almost 24/7 (two swims) and no issues.  I was initially interested in the Charge HR but when I learned it was not recommended for swimming (which is pretty well the only place I envisioned using the HR function), I opted for the Flex and saved some $. I already have a cheap Bowflex HR monitor/watch/stopwatch that I bought from Groupon about 6 months back to use in the pool, so this solution works for me. (Fitbit on left wrist, HR monitor on the right.)  Sure, the other features would have been nice, but the Flex is doing its job in motivating me already.   My advice is that if you want a 24/7 tracker, get the Flex, and use the app to log your swim activity. It's really the entire app package that is motivational for me, but as in life, YMMV.  I'll come back and re-post if the pool ever kills it.  Edit: clarity."
fitbit,3b9ovt,autopilot638,2,Sat Jun 27 13:35:16 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was pretty sure the flex was the only one that was useable in the pool.   Sounds like its the one I want then. Imfairly attached to my phone so using it to track shouldn't be a problem as long as I can keep it on.
fitbit,3b9ovt,kwpg3,2,Sat Jun 27 15:13:33 2015 UTC,This is why I've stayed with the Flex model. No issues with the Flex in the pool. I have a Polar HRM with chest strap for work outs and cardio.

fitbit,3b5ntg,ryanadanderson,3,Fri Jun 26 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"I wish we could change what screen you see with the gesture, I wear an actual watch on the other arm, so I don't really need to see the clock on my Charge HR, calories count would fit better for me. But still, good improvement, it's a first step :)"
fitbit,3b5ntg,GoddessofAwesomeness,2,Fri Jun 26 07:29:33 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I would love. I am a watch guy and only use the Charge HR as a activity tracker. I even disabled the clock and the notifications as I don't want myself getting to the point where I never wear a watch again.
fitbit,3b5ntg,Devil_Penguin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:17:36 2015 UTC,I thought that too! What if steps (or other goals) are more important to me than checking the time? I wonder what the reasoning behind the limitation was. I'd think that it'd be pretty easy to program it.
fitbit,3b5ntg,DJ__Simmons,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"In your settings (I'm looking at my computer) click on ""devices"", select your device and scroll down to the sub-heading ""tap gesture"".  You can then select what you see with the gesture out of:  Off,     Show Clock,     Show Steps,    Show Heart Rate,    Show Distance,  Show Calories &    Show Floors"
fitbit,3b5ntg,DJ__Simmons,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:59:24 2015 UTC,It's a little annoying honestly. I haven't been following development and after the update I noticed that my clock just keeps on popping up every so often. Checking the settings I found a quick view setting. Checking what triggers it now or I'll just turn it off.  Edit: After 15 seconds of Googling I found it gets triggered by turning it towards the user. It's buggy but I understand now. I thought my button had water damage or something.
fitbit,3b5ntg,Big9erfan,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"Loving it just because of this addition. Now just waiting on Notification support for messages and support for Health App on iOS so I don't have to use Sync Solver, it's just automatic."
fitbit,3b5ntg,DJ__Simmons,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"True. I don't even need the whole message, if they can just say who a text is From it would be perfect."

fitbit,3b5ntg,butylparaben,2,Fri Jun 26 07:40:29 2015 UTC,Can Someone Elaborate the quick view feature??
fitbit,3b5ntg,onett,4,Fri Jun 26 14:36:41 2015 UTC,When you raise your wrist to look at the screen the clock comes on briefly without needed to push a button.   You can also now tap the screen to cycle through your stats.
fitbit,3b3k1l,Big9erfan,27,Thu Jun 25 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Here are the changes:  Version 18.84  This release provides the following new features and improvements:   With Quick View, you don’t need a free hand to check the time on your Charge HR. Instead of pressing the button, just turn your wrist towards you and the time will appear for a few seconds. You can enable Quick View under Settings > Devices on your web dash.  Immediately get summary data about your workouts instead of waiting to sync your tracker. Now when you turn exercise mode off, your workout’s elapsed time scrolls across the tracker’s screen for about four seconds. After the elapsed time, the following summary stats appear in turn:      *   Average heart rate      *   Calories burned      *   Steps taken      *   Distance covered      *   Floors climbed  If you miss the summary, you can always check your dashboard after syncing to see all your historical data.  * You can now tap your screen once to advance to the next screen. Go to Settings > >Devices and make sure Tap Gesture is on.     When charging your tracker, you’ll now see the current battery level.     When you meet your fitness goal, your tracker will celebrate immediately instead of  waiting for you to press the button.  This release resolves the following issues:  High floor counts have been fixed. Some customers reported that their floor totals were too high.    All exercise records now appear on the Activities page. Some customers reported being unable to view historical activities.   Trackers no longer restart unexpectedly. Some customers reported that trackers would restart during setup or while enabling call notifications.   The two things I bolded are, at least to me, a big deal. Glad they're improving it!"

fitbit,3b3k1l,Aducky,3,Thu Jun 25 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"Make sure you've got your app updated, a new version was released on iOS on 6/22 (not sure when it was pushed to Android)"
fitbit,3b3k1l,dude2k5,3,Thu Jun 25 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"Got it on android as well, after I updated the app, opened it, and it was showing there was an update. Thanks for the heads up!  edit: Had to turn off wifi temporarily while updating, was getting a fail to connect.  edit2: Still failing but it gets like 75% of the way. Not sure why.   edit3: Turned bluetooth off and on and it worked, successful update."
fitbit,3b3k1l,noteverjoe,6,Thu Jun 25 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"I also had some issues with this update with it getting about 75% and then saying update failed to complete. (android - latest fitbit app)  After about 20 minutes of tinkering this is what fixed it for me:  On the Try Again screen - instead of clicking Try Again, minimize the app (don't close it) - turn off bluetooth on your mobile device - wait - turn bluetooth back on - wait - bring up the app - click Try Again.  This worked for me, hope it helps someone."
fitbit,3b3k1l,speccers,2,Thu Jun 25 21:16:38 2015 UTC,Worked perfectly after I did this. Thanks!

fitbit,3b3k1l,PhilboFaggins,9,Fri Jun 26 04:23:57 2015 UTC,"Aww, I kind of liked that it would wait to ""celebrate"" until I hit the button. I like the little light show but I can't always look at my wrist when it goes off."
fitbit,3b3k1l,NewOnX,11,Thu Jun 25 19:37:13 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite. I would press the button to see the time or a stat and have to wait for the stupid fireworks to end.

I was trying to help someone set up their Charge HR yesterday and it said there was a firmware update but right before she hit the end of the update she had an error sign on her HR (which I've never seen before).  Tried updating it through my phone (iPhone 6 which always does FitBit stuff beautifully) and same issue, we tried through her computer and same.  She had another one that we tried on as well, all with the same result.  I was wondering if the ones she had bought weren't from a bad batch because I still have yet to be prompted for a firmware update on my HR and I've had it for several months now...curious if this is a known issue or not, and when I can expect the update."
fitbit,3b3k1l,bbqforbrontosaurus,2,Thu Jun 25 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"There were 0 updates for the Charge HR until very recently.  It was still running with the shipped firmware of 64 (when the band restarts it shows the firmware version or it will say it in the app when you tap on ""Charge HR""  at the top it should say ""Version 64"" or ""Version 84"" if you've updated.  If there's issues doing the update, try restarting the tracker first and then performing the update."

I believe they base this off your current activity level, so unless you just exercised before going to bed, your activity level would be pretty low so the calculations should be fairly accurate even if you go to sleep.

fitbit,3b6iz8,ekodyne,3,Fri Jun 26 13:05:05 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah at some points it's exciting for me, though a lot of the time it's more of a jump and then a panic to make it stop."
fitbit,3b6iz8,Grippler,3,Fri Jun 26 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"maybe the device is merging with my nervous system   I would not be afraid of that, it is impossible for it to merge with your nervous system. You have most likely just developed some sort of twitch that is triggered by the vibration."
fitbit,3b6iz8,Grippler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:56:17 2015 UTC,"I put that in as kind of a joke, but yeah I think it's something I developed from the vibration. It also might be over a nerve cluster if I'm feeling it in my neck."

fitbit,3b6c1u,DJ__Simmons,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:30:32 2015 UTC,I would contact costumer support on that one. My fitbit Charge HR button fell off and they replaced it with a whole new device.
fitbit,3b6c1u,Tellmama,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"Was think of doing that, what is the process that I might go through? Could you explain what you did?"
fitbit,3b6c1u,Tellmama,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"Sure! I called the customer support phone number at 877-623-4997. I explained the issue, that the button had simply and inexplicable fallen off god-knows-where. They asked to provide a few things; a copy of the purchase receipt,  which I had from Amazon. They also asked that I send a picture of the damage, clearly showing the missing button, along with the purchase receipt to a customer support email they game me with a referenced claim ticket number they gave me at that time.  The next day, I got a response email that my claim had been accepted and that a new device matching all the same specs as the original, would be shipped to me asap. I got my brand new device within about a week and a half. No problems since. In fact, I realized, after I got my new device, that the old one was faulty, because the button never felt secure. It was always a bit ""wiggly."" New device is a gem!"
fitbit,3b6c1u,Tellmama,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:46:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for letting me know.

fitbit,3b5epw,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Just be careful though. Eating only 1,000 calories a day is very harmful. Generally, men aren't supposed to go below 1,500."
fitbit,3b5epw,Schnabulation,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:13:45 2015 UTC,"I'm using MyNetDiary for the tracking. While MND and FitBit both say that my basal metabolic rate (lying in bed 24/7) is around 1900, the actual burnt calories differ in both apps. But I trust the FitBits number more because they calculate the number based on the steps and the heart rate.  So I would suggest you start tracking your workouts with your FitBit. This way you have a quite accurate number. At the end of a regular week you take the number and divide it by 7. Now you have your daily number. Eat 500 kcal less and lose weight."

fitbit,3b2zcv,TheEthalea,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:22:17 2015 UTC,It really depends if people are using Normal or Sensitive mode. I get ~40% with one of the options and >95% with the other.

fitbit,3b2zcv,ssmeoow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"I have never slept much. I get tired around 1:30 or 2:00 and typically sleep 5 hours a night. I'm fascinated by people like my wife who can sleep 8+ hours because I just can't do it. If I go to bed earlier, I just lay there. And I can't stay in bed long after I wake up. So it's been 5 or 5.5 hours for me, for as long as I can remember.  Now that we both have Fitbit, it's interesting to compare. She's in bed 8.5 hours but Fitbit shows a lot of restless time and tells her she only got 6 or 7 hours of sleep. She's lucky to see 90% efficiency. Meanwhile, my efficiency has been 98% once, 100% once, and 99% every other time. So I get nice looking graphs, but for fewer hours than I should. Everything I read or see on television tells me I should sleep 8 hours.  My last 3 nights"

Just pick one for tracking calories, and don't pay attention to the other.  I tend to just focus on MyFitnessPal.  I don't know how good the FitBit food database is now, but when I started, MFP was much better.  It has practically any food you can think of, and the amount of calories you can consume is adjusted as FitBit syncs with MFP.  The numbers may also be drastically different because of the goal you might set in MFP vs FitBit."

fitbit,3b2l6p,xXriderXx7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"It's all based off what you input for your body metrics. The dashboard uses all that, combined with your heart rate, to to estimate how many calories you burn just by existing. Any exercise you do on top of that increases the amount of calories you burn and Fitbit will account for that.  The trouble is it's just not going to be perfectly accurate. Google what your basic metabolic rate is. That'll tell you based off your body what you burn just existing every day."

fitbit,3b1cy8,sodiumlaurethsulfate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:35:59 2015 UTC,"you can lower the sensitivity by setting it to dominant-hand wearing, while wearing it on the non-dominant hand. This eliminated any false step count for me. To improve HR, you can try to wear it a little tighter and further up your arm.  The floor counting is known to be broken for some people at the moment, I think they are working on fixing it though. FWIW, I've never had any issues with my Surge counting false floors."

Many people report they are uncomfortable to wear, but for short periods for a study they are probably fine. When using one in research I had one subject unintentionally turn the device off. You may need to train your subjects on device use if you expect them to wear it for more than a few hours.  Note that Jawbone just bought the company, so this may be a feature coming to Jawbone in the future, though I imagine this is a ways out."

fitbit,3ax4iw,CBML50,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do about 3/4 of a mile in one direction (3/8 of a mile walk to the subway and another 3/8 from the subway to my desk) so I get about 2 miles from daily activity.  I play with Cherry in the yard and indoors a lot - we only have 700 sq ft total, but the kitchen/living room is mostly open so indoor fetch and tug is super easy.  The 4 closest dog parks are about another 1-2 miles round trip (3 of them we need to take the T to, the one that is closest walkable isn't fantastic).  Unless I'm really trying, I rarely hit my 10k M-F, which used to be so easy when I worked outside of the city and could walk 2-6 miles a day through a beautiful wooded area to get to public transportation.  However, in the spring, I'd still average 12k steps a day, because thanks to some really hotly contested Weekend Warriors I set up, I was doing ~25k steps each day Saturday and Sunday with Cherry-boo and the BF."
fitbit,3ax4iw,orangetangerine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"I set my goal to 12k a day because 1. I like to overachieve and 2. I figured it would force me to get up and out.   I usually manage around 13-14k during the week depending on if I go home for lunch or where I walk Tucker after work - the dog park is a 1.5 mile walk one way, the usual loops I do around the city are between 1.5-2 miles.   I am super competitive though and basically die if I'm not at the top of my friends list. Haha."
fitbit,3ax4iw,CBML50,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"I like to stay competitive as well, but it's really tough for me.  I have about 50 active people on my Fitbit friends list.  The top person on my list (140k steps/wk) lives in the suburbs without a car, works on her feet, is a fitness fanatic, and walks to and from work.  The second from the top (120k steps/wk) works in a lab and is on her feet the whole day, as well as rides and trains horses.  The next 4 or 5 or so are all runners with desk jobs.  I hate running (although I make a good effort of it sometimes) and ever since I got Cherry it's been more important that I get home to interact with her, instead of taking my sweet time doing nature walks.  If she wasn't so lazy during the week it would be a little easier.  Now that she's full grown, dog parks are hit or miss since she's choosy with her company, so instead of taking her every day like when she was a puppy, it seems more of a waste if I do now.  When I worked outside of the city and was single, it didn't matter if it took me 2 hours to walk 6 miles home from the office, or if I walked 2 miles each way from the office to the T stop, since I didn't have to rush home to let the pup out.  We should be Fitbit friends! I'll add you to my Weekend Warriors; they seem to get a lot of interest most weekends.  I'll be having a lousy weekend this weekend since I'll be at a workshop all of Saturday, but you can compete against some of my crazy friends, lol."

I don't mind that it doesn't have an HR monitor because I work out too hard (I've read that the accuracy is questionable during workouts, especially over 160bpm) and thus have a separate monitor with a chest strap for exercises. As with every other fitness tracker, I take the calorie burn data with a grain of salt and treat it as a guide rather than absolute truth.  As a girl, I love that it's small and discreet and that I don't have to make it a part of my outfit. It does sleep tracking if you're in to that, and aside from the heart rate all other base functionality seems to be in line with the rest of the devices."

fitbit,3avfgg,nitwhit88,9,Tue Jun 23 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"when you say that ""you just got it"" do you mean earlier today? Your resting heart rate isn't going to be remotely accurate until you've had a few nights sleep. That being said 96+ seems pretty high for a resting heart rate. I know no-one wants to hear this, but you might want to consult with your doctor to see that you are good for strenuous activity. Also find out what your ideal heart rates should be for working out and set them manually."
fitbit,3avfgg,Udderpunch,2,Tue Jun 23 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just got it a few days ago, maybe it's still adjusting. I wasn't sure if it needed to calibrate or anything."
fitbit,3avfgg,thesprawl2,5,Wed Jun 24 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"There's actually an option to define your own heart rate zones, try increasing the lower limit."
fitbit,3avfgg,unreqistered,3,Tue Jun 23 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks for that. I really can't see myself being in the ""fat burning zone"" for half my waking day."
fitbit,3avfgg,unreqistered,3,Wed Jun 24 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"The heavier you are the more your body burns simply to exist.  Without your age it's a guesstimate but 3000 isn't outside the bounds for someone of your weight/stature.  I believe the Fitbit shows the ""stay alive"" intake need until you've set up goals.  The are a multitude of websites that will help you understand/calculate your BMR (basic metabolic rate).  From there you can determine what your caloric intake should be in order to meet your weight loss goal.  I don't use a static max calorie intake goal, but shoot for at least 1500-2000 less than what the Fitbit says I burned off.  So if I really push a day and burn 4000-5000 cal, I'll let myself enjoy an extra helping of steak fries or a wedge of pie."
fitbit,3avfgg,Skycakes,2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured the FitBit knew best, but I wasn't sure how it calculated to meet the goals and if it needed time to set up accurate counts. Man, that means I was eating 3000+ cals a day to gain all this 120 extra pounds D: FitBit opened my eyes!"
fitbit,3avfgg,Themehmeh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"It didn't go on all at once, and it won't come off instantaneously either.  Slow and steady wins the race."

fitbit,3avfgg,Udderpunch,4,Tue Jun 23 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"Something isn't right, but it might be your heart.  You can manually change the fat burn zones but really, if your heart is working that hard to keep you alive you probably are burning quite a few calories. 3000 still seems like a lot. you might want to talk to /r/loseit to discuss the math   Maybe check your actual heartrate manually and make sure it matches?   For reference: I'm 5'2 and 203lbs, down from 227 as of this February. My average heartrate is around 60 if I maintain my exercise and about 75 if I haven't exercised in a month or so.  I am usually fairly active and breastfeeding (500 calories a day) and can afford something like 3000 calories if I want to maintain my current weight. I try to keep my intake under 2000, usually ends up something around 1900 and I've been losing 1.5-2lbs a week. (when I behave... I am bad at consistently eating healthy) I use the myfitness pal paired with the fitbit to tell me accurately how many calories I've eaten vs burned so it tells me to start at 1600 calories and gives me points for how active I've been."
fitbit,3avfgg,jstar02,4,Tue Jun 23 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, other than the pregnancy those stats are near identical to mine. I just started losing again though so I'm running slow.   Way to go!"

I spoke to my doctor about this and he said that in my circumstance its not in heard of for someone who is over weight, has anxiety, is on medication for ADHD and smoked in the past (quit 3 years ago). Take a look at your entire picture, and remember while your heart rate is high anything from 60 to 100 is considered normal.   Definitely talk to your doctor, but as one fattie to another the strain of carrying around that extra weight will cause your heart to beat faster on the regular."
fitbit,3avfgg,Grippler,2,Tue Jun 23 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I have anxiety as well and my resting HR hasn't been under 80 for years (since I gained my last 50 lbs); and being that I've had heart issues in the past (seen by a cardiologist and corrected), I know what my regular heartbeat feels like and the scary ""omg my heart rate is up for no reason."""
fitbit,3avfgg,Lilidawn,2,Wed Jun 24 02:17:23 2015 UTC,I was similar in size to you. YOu would be surprised how many calories you actually consume when you log Everything you eat. and I mean everything. I didn't realize I was averaging 4-7k calories a day. and Maintaining at that. Reduce by 500 or more if you can. and even that will make a big difference. Even substituting items will lower the calories without leaving you hungry all the time. :) and I was 5'2 and 267 at my highest.
fitbit,3avfgg,Grippler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:56:20 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily want to eat everything the display shows you burned.   What does your dashboard say?   You can set it to a level of weight loss you are aiming for and see what kind of gap it suggests every day.
fitbit,3avfgg,BTBishops,2,Wed Jun 24 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"I believe you should be just fine as long as you eat at least 1000kcal if you're female or 1200kcal if you're male, each day to make sure you don't starve yourself.  EDIT: that being said, you probably shouldn't aim for anything lower than 2000kcal per day to begin with, you can always readjust the amount when you get further along with your weight loss."

fitbit,3b03fd,paby,2,Wed Jun 24 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"At the risk of sounding grumpy : Ugh. Saying you're measuring 'heart rate' is misleading at best when it's doing (presumably?) ballistocardiography. Questionable claims without any proof : 'the data collection is accurate enough to measure sleep phases' - great, show me the studies. I don't mind cheap phone apps claiming this, but if it's a several hundred dollar electric blanket I kinda expect a bit more science."
fitbit,3aw2yk,1981sdp,3,Tue Jun 23 23:37:26 2015 UTC,It's poor marketing and poor planning on Fitbit's part. They shouldn't show something people won't be able to buy anytime soon. I've been staring longingly at that tangerine Surge for awhile now. I have a black one and it just doesn't go well with outfits. It's a black blob on my arm. I actually think the tangerine would stand out less.
fitbit,3aw2yk,PammyLZ,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:44:41 2015 UTC,They have planned the blue and orange but not released it for any of the bands yet. They likely won't be available until Christmas time if not next year.
fitbit,3axj44,apache_cook,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:19:09 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried that myself either XDD  But I want to say it may not work that way as the Fitbit calculates change in elevation.   So although you're stepping upwards non-stop, you would be ""stationary"" in terms of altitude to your tracker. I suspect it would catch all the steps, but not count flights of stairs.  http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/How-does-my-tracker-count-floors  What you COULD do is perhaps find a hiking trail with lots of ups and downs (i.e. changes in elevation). I too want to try go for the levels per day badges and am guessing hiking would be best bet, as opposed to going up stairs and back down to go back up again, non stop."
fitbit,3axj44,arekkusuro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, might have to do that.  On that note the stepmaster things at the gym wont work either."
fitbit,3axj44,loseitfrenchie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would because the level-counting on a charge HR works with an altimeter (measures your altitude). So i'f you're gonna be walking up an escalator that's going down, you're technically staying around the same level..  Find some stairs? I always take the stairs when available, and if the only option is the escalator, i walk up as fast as I can so it might count a bit more levels than it should, but I wouldve done my best to make it as accurate as possible.  Also, you don't really need a staircase that's very high for it to count one level, just a normal house staircase would be more than enough :)"
fitbit,3axj44,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:44:30 2015 UTC,I always take the steps regardless.  I did notice the other day when I ran up some steps at work (3-5 steps at a time) and it did not register it as a level.

Five days before it started to rise, peaked at 68 three days before and went down to normal once I got it.   Edit Strangely enough as well, during the HR rise was when I started getting super moody / PMS / teary. The worst day was also the day my HR was highest and it tapered off the following two days.

I'm also starting to wonder about the converse- low HR at the time of ovulation. I wonder if low HR is a signifier of healer and fertility, and we have evolved to have lower heart rates when we are most fertile? Its so interesting lol!!"

I'm not sure if it's the fact that it's shaped a little bit differently than the Charge or if it's the extra bump for the HR sensor...but it's definitely different.
fitbit,3attip,CPHBOSDCA,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Hm. That's very interesting to hear. I have small bony wrists as well, so I hope the heart monitor isn't a problem for me.  Thanks for letting me know about the regular Charge, though. I think I'll try out the HR first. If it doesn't work out, I'll definitely exchange it for the Charge like you guys did. Looks like Fitbit has an awesome 45 day return policy."
fitbit,3attip,elizabethan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"I have small bony wrists too, and I haven't had trouble with the ChargeHR. The instructions from Fitbit say that it's best to wear it a finger width or two above your wrist bone, which leads to better HR reads. I find that when I wear it that way, it doesn't even come in contact with my wrist bone so it doesn't hurt. Hope that helps!"
fitbit,3attip,elizabethan,3,Wed Jun 24 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"I've had a flex for about 6 months or so. I've had to replace the band once because the rubber started to crack from the stress of removing the little flex brain from the wristband to charge it.  With both bands I've had a problem with the clasp coming unfastened, to the point where I really don't trust it to stay on my wrist, honestly. I have tiny child-sized wrists, fwiw.   I used to have a One, but I got the flex for free at work through our wellness program so I gave the One to my mom, and let me tell you, I really miss being able to see the exact number of steps right on the device rather than firing up the app on my phone and waiting for it to sync. I also miss the stairs count.   I'm about to upgrade to the Charge HR for the better band, the more useful display, the heart rate tracking, and the automatic sleep tracking. I vastly prefer having a device on my wrist than clipped to my bra or pants: I can truly forget about it there instead of forgetting it's in a pocket and throwing it in the wash.   The flex is a good budget option but honestly I don't know why someone would choose it over a Charge, and if you're paying for a Charge you might as well shell out for the HR version."
fitbit,3attip,mrcarlita,2,Tue Jun 23 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Damn. You've only had your Flex for 6 months and the rubber already cracked from stress? That really sucks. Thankfully you got the Flex for free.   Doesn't sound like the Flex is really worth the trouble, tbh. I don't mind having to buy a new band as needed, but if I have to buy one every 6 months because it's cracked or the clasp keeps unfastening, then the Flex isn't worth it. I'm sure the lifespan of the Flex band depends on the person, but other people here also said the quality of that band is iffy."
fitbit,3attip,MyFreakyThrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"So, the thing that puts stress on the band, from my experience, is sliding the little tracker in and out of it when you need to charge it. I think what also might be a contributing factor, for me, is this my wrist is really small so I have the band fastened on the 3rd and 4th last holes, which makes the rubber housing bow out a little bit in the same spot that sees the stress from taking out the tracker. There are over 100 people where I work and most have fitbits, so when mine broke I went to the wellness gal and exchanged the large band that had come with my Flex for a small one that someone else hadn't used, and she admitted that it was a common problem.   I just picked up my charge HR after work! (birthday money burning a hole in my pocket!) The material is a lot softer and more comfortable than the Flex. The main tracking part of it though takes up more room in the band so it pokes out a but on either side of my wrist and doesn't conform to my wrist shape as easily as the Flex does, for what it's worth. I'm going to give it a few weeks and if I can't get comfortable with it I'll take it back.   Sorry I write such novels! The fit and feel of the thing is something I'm really concerned with because my small wrists are a pain in the ass. I'll probably write a full fit review here after I've had it for a while so other neurotic people like me can get some information."
fitbit,3attip,granolatron,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"Haha. Don't worry about writing long replies. They're helpful!  I have very small wrists as well, so I'd probably end up in the same situation as you: using the 3rd and 4th last holes. Then I'd end up with a cracked wristband with a clasp that tends to undo itself.  Nice to hear the HR material is softer and more comfortable. I've actually seen a number of people wear their HR upside down for comfort. One of my specialist doctors does that. I thought it was weird at first, but then I realized that it may be more comfortable to wear upside down if the heart rate monitor keeps digging into the top of your arm. You have more fat on the bottom part of your arm than on the top, which is why wearing it upside down may be more comfortable. It might conform to you wrist better that way."
fitbit,3attip,Big9erfan,2,Wed Jun 24 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"I have the flex and regret not getting a charge hr very strongly. The flex is pretty minimal, and although the band is not an issue, I really wish I had all the other features the Hr comes with. I definitely recommend a charge"
fitbit,3attip,glamsauce,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"I like the bells and whistles of the Charge HR, but have actually downgraded to the flex for one reason alone: I can wear the flex in the shower and pool without issue.  The Charge HR has to be taken off for those activities.  I really like the ability to leave the flex on 24/7 unless I'm charging it.  Also, a cheap ""BitBelt"" off of Amazon will ensure the device never comes undone and falls off."

If you set your surge to the ""workout"" activity and then change it to driving on the website, it will subtract the steps. It's a known issue with all the fitbits that sometimes they pick up ""steps"" while driving."

fitbit,3au560,1981sdp,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"I know that it has been said that the Charge HR is better for the HR sensor, and I have read that in more places than one, this guy does a phenomenal review of the two and he prefers the HR. Plus its a 100 bucks cheaper. But watch the video for yourself...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRxQA-P50pc"
fitbit,3au560,jhawker66,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:42:20 2015 UTC,So the Charge HR is more accurate?  How does that work if they use the same method?   I suppose that would be a huge pro for the Charge HR.  Anyone know how the Charge HR does in the rain?   What about showering or washing hands.  I don't plan to shower with it just curious if it can handle that kind of treatment I do wash my hands often.
fitbit,3au560,jhawker66,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"I think its more accurate because it can get a ""snugger fit on the wrist, plus it doesnt have all the features to focus on like the surge.  They are technically waterproof but the reasoning behind not showering with them and all of that is because they say the soap and all of that can wear away at the bands causing them to break. That's why they recommend at least not showering with them on.   They can both handle rain no problem.  But again the biggest reason the charge HR is more accurate is because it is much more likely to stay in place during a workout because its smaller.  They say with the surge its even a pain to put a long sleeve over it."
fitbit,3au560,sodiumlaurethsulfate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Usually people say the surge is more accurate than the charge. Its possible, I certainly don't believe the charge is better. Best to consider the charge splash proof rather than immersion proof - mine has been rained on plenty but I wouldn't shower in it."
fitbit,3au560,Grippler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"All the reviews i've read and watched online conclude that the Surge is by far the best of the two to measure HR, especially during exercise.  here is one example, they are compared to a chest strap around the 5:40 mark."

My rule of thumb is anything that either A) spend over 100 dollars on B) is used daily is worth getting the accidental warranty.  I'm sorry for your loss.

I've only had it since February so I'm pretty peeved about the entire situation.

Perhaps the battery was so dead that it hasn't even registered enough of a charge to move past that first dot.    There is a little pinhole on the back of the charging dongle that you can use to ""reset"" the flex while it is in the charging dongle.  I'd try putting a paperclip in here and holding it for a few seconds, then giving it a little bit to charge and see if there is any change.   If it's nothing going from here, the battery in the device may be toast and you/your boss will need to contact fitbit support to try and get a replacement if it is within the warranty period."

fitbit,3aquov,meules,2,Mon Jun 22 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought that too, but I can's swipe to ""Run"" or ""Settings, both of which should always be on regardless of what I choose for my exercise shortcuts."
fitbit,3aquov,Grippler,2,Mon Jun 22 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"There is a reset, and it wont clear any data just resets the watch. Press and hold the home and select buttons(left and bottom right) for about 10 seconds until the screen flashes or turns off. Let go of buttons, wait about 10 seconds after screen turns completely off. Press Home(left) button to turn back on."

fitbit,3argrm,procrastinator7,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:28:07 2015 UTC,Nope.
fitbit,3argrm,Some_Other_Sherman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:10 2015 UTC,oh noooooo. Why would they do this?? I get that the light would be annoying at night but I don't see why they can't make it optional!  I'm surprised no hacker/programmer has been able to find a workaround.
fitbit,3argrm,1981sdp,2,Tue Jun 23 05:45:15 2015 UTC,You could always get a surge?  Not the best solution but it seems to be the only one for this specific problem.  On the plus side the surge is more water resistant which comes in handy as often as a nurse is probably washing their hands and dealing with other fluids.
fitbit,3argrm,1981sdp,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're totally right but I don't think I would like the size of the surge. It's a bit big for my tastes.  I guess I can't have everything that I want all in one. :( oh well. Thank you for your advice."

fitbit,3ankk8,bklove1,6,Mon Jun 22 01:00:50 2015 UTC,That and maybe an inactivity alert.
fitbit,3ankk8,Schnabulation,2,Mon Jun 22 02:21:29 2015 UTC,That would be all I ever need!
fitbit,3ankk8,simplisticwonders,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:08:52 2015 UTC,A customizable one I hope. I work a job where I am often required to sit in one spot for hours at a time. I am aware of this and don't need a device telling me to move around in the middle of a show.
fitbit,3ankk8,marcus_realist,5,Mon Jun 22 19:55:35 2015 UTC,The ability to pause a tracked activity.

fitbit,3ankk8,marcus_realist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:19:18 2015 UTC,You can't pause an activity that you started from the tracker.

fitbit,3ankk8,UKArch,5,Thu Jun 25 22:58:10 2015 UTC,One without bluetooth (never going to happen) I work in a prison and they have banned any fitness watches with bluetooth so I can't wear mine anymore. If only the security department wasn't so clueless and thought about decisions. The bluetooth is useless and can't transmit any real data anyway!
fitbit,3ankk8,dano8801,2,Mon Jun 22 10:31:51 2015 UTC,What exactly are they pretending is the risk with bluetooth???
fitbit,3ankk8,UKArch,3,Mon Jun 22 18:54:41 2015 UTC,They claim it can hold and transmit data (in a way it can) but what it transmits is of zero use to anyone... if it was the gps I could understand lol.
fitbit,3ankk8,tencentsgetsyounuts,8,Mon Jun 22 22:52:15 2015 UTC,I want it to vibrate a warning that the battery is going to die. I have all day sync turned on and I never end up receiving the email for low battery unless I open up the app and sync. I also don't always check my screen on the HR so I won't always catch the batter symbol showing.
fitbit,3ankk8,ezaviar,4,Mon Jun 22 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"Hopefully a big update for the website. I absolutely love my fitbit, but the website is very clunky and not very user friendly."
fitbit,3ankk8,sndrsk,2,Mon Jun 22 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"Hopefully better data presentation. It's too vanilla and their website has not kept up with their hardware.  Who am I kidding... they won't revamp the website. But they should... they are trying to target competitive athletes and compete with Garmin in high-end hardware but until they get their data in order, they're not gonna win."
fitbit,3ankk8,michsineath,2,Mon Jun 22 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"More data, better data presentation, and personalized insight via the app. See Jawbone.  EDIT: Both Fitbit and Jawbone have similar stats, Fitbit's seems to just be a little more buried and only on the website."
fitbit,3ankk8,julianhunt,2,Mon Jun 22 08:45:50 2015 UTC,"I want a chest strap I can use during my workouts that will sync with the fitbit app. The fitbit charge just isn't accurate enough for my cardio sessions.. :/ I love the Charge HR for wearing 24/7 for my steps, sleep tracking and resting HR. But for high performance exercise I really need something more accurate that will integrate with my fitbit ecosystem :)"
fitbit,3ankk8,guyincognito1776,2,Fri Jun 26 19:21:32 2015 UTC,Adding a micro-usb charge interface. I hate the proprietary charge adapters.
fitbit,3ankk8,Grippler,0,Mon Jun 22 08:42:20 2015 UTC,but how will they make extra money from you then!? all they can do is charge you the extra $50 for your own data! /s

fitbit,3ankk8,wordsoundpower,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:58:02 2015 UTC,A screen that shows everything at a glance rather than having to swipe. Swiping should go more in depth for each stat.
fitbit,3ankk8,Grippler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:58:11 2015 UTC,"It's simply not possible to show time, steps, HR, distance, calories and floors all at the same time on a screen that fits on a wrist, while still readable at a glance."
fitbit,3ankk8,wordsoundpower,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ for a form factor like the Surge. On something like that, it would be simple to have more info per screen that what is currently in use. For something like the Charge HR, I'd agree with you."
fitbit,3ankk8,Grippler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"More info per screen is definitely possible, but having all your data ready and visible at a glance is simply  it possible, some swiping/button pressing will be required."

fitbit,3aotxy,catskulls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:09:54 2015 UTC,I'm confused at what I'm supposed to be seeing.
fitbit,3aotxy,MisuVir,2,Mon Jun 22 14:17:35 2015 UTC,Sorry I fell asleep last night when posting this.   If you look at the bottom right there seems to be some sort of blue film with the shape of a rectangle.  I don't think it's normal.  I was hoping to get your opinions if I should return  it for another.
fitbit,3aotxy,catskulls,2,Mon Jun 22 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, if it is under the screen then it is a manufacturing defect. Contact Fitbit support and they'll probably send you a new one."
fitbit,3aotxy,dano8801,0,Tue Jun 23 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... I'm still not seeing it. I mean,it is effecting the fuctionality of it or anything?"

fitbit,3an04l,letsgolakers24,2,Sun Jun 21 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"that sounds about right. you burn about 1 calorie per minute if you stay perfectly still and exert no extra energy, so that's 60 calories/hr."
fitbit,3an04l,jordansideas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"It counts your BMR as well, that is what is causing this. It is supposed to happen, you can calculate your BMR here, all calories burned from moving and exercise is added to that number."
fitbit,3an04l,Grippler,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"https://blog.udemy.com/how-many-calories-do-you-burn-sleeping/  According to this, you burn approximately 0.4-0.5 calories per hour, per pound while sleeping. I think fitbit takes this into account, which it why you will wake up with calories burned.  The example from this link calculates that a 200lb person getting 8 hours of sleep will burn ~640-800 calories."
fitbit,3an04l,reason78,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"Those calories represent your basic calories burnt just to keep you alive and your body working.  It's your body generating warmth, growing muscles, digesting food, healing, developing new skin cells etc.  It's call your BMR (basal metabolic rate)."
fitbit,3anr1c,sbarry17,4,Mon Jun 22 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"The 1600 is your basic metabolic rate - as in, if you do no steps all day, your body will still burn about that many. As you work out, that number will increase. For instance, right now, mine says that I've burned about 3,300 calories - I went for a run today and have taken over 15k steps, so that makes sense."

fitbit,3amntt,nomnomtastic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:53:12 2015 UTC,The battery level indicator isn't very reliable and I've seen it get confused. It takes much longer than that to fully charge for me.

fitbit,3amntt,miller69,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"If you've got the HR if you press the button on the actual device it will tell you how charged it is when it's plugged in. If it fills all the way it's fully charged.  I never go by the app, the app is super wonky at times for me."
fitbit,3amntt,catskulls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on how often you check it, how often you sync it to the phone or if it's on all day sync, if you have the hr moniter on all the time or on auto, ect. It's just like anything with a battery, more use and the battery will drain faster."
fitbit,3amntt,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"It takes 20-30 minutes for my Charge HR to go from 'warning' to almost full, and that gives me 5-6 days of use even with heart rate and blue tooth on continuously."
fitbit,3anyj5,dugfunne,2,Mon Jun 22 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on which fitbit you have. If you have the Charge HR or the Surge it will track your heart rate all day. Through the app you can see how your heart rate changes through the day.   IF you don't already have a fitbit device or are looking to upgrade, then I suggest the Charge HR. The Surge I kinda view is being geared more towards more serious athletes."

Ignore the fact that I already have a high starting bpm because I'm a big, not very fit girl, but you get the point. You can get this graph for any day.

fitbit,3amcbg,nomnomtastic,2,Sun Jun 21 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"When the battery is low, it'll flash up briefly when you press the button. Even when reporting as low battery, it'll still last another day or so. Most of the time, I don't care how charged it is."

I don't know if you had to do this with the Flex, but make sure to change your settings to dominant hand, regardless of which you use. It really helps."

I'm trying to not focus on short term and hope to see the benifits of the motivation it gives me in the long run.

I'd assume that unlike Charge (which is a cross sliding straight threading) or say Flex (no threading at all), Charge HR is more prone to having tiny amounts of water not dripping and also all the tiny dead skins trapped over a period of time."
fitbit,3aixjx,a_horse_with_no_tail,2,Sat Jun 20 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Re: charge hr. The texture doesn't trap water for me because, well, I don't really get it wet! Also the grooves are very, very shallow. And since the texture is only on the top, no skin in the grooves either."

fitbit,3ak1gp,Mejay11096,3,Sat Jun 20 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I know unless you buy it a specific color you cannot change the band. It's not like the flex which fits inside a band, it's  all one piece."
fitbit,3ajexd,BalooBallin,5,Sat Jun 20 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"I have been using the computer to charge exclusively and had the same problem, so I'm skeptical of that being the answer."
fitbit,3ajexd,LadyoftheDam,5,Sat Jun 20 22:00:09 2015 UTC,"That's not an acceptable answer. All USB chargers use 5V, so there's no voltage difference there (that's the point of using a standard connector).   Most wall chargers will output from 0.5A to 1A (up to 2A for tablet chargers), while USB ports in computers go from 0.5A to 0.9A depending on the motherboard. So, even using a computer, the current output will vary with with each computer that you use.  Also, the battery charging circuit in the Flex is supposed to regulate how much current is being used. If you use a charger with a high current rating, your device is supposed to limit it. This either means that the Flex has a design flaw or yours was faulty."

Not really ideal, but I haven't been able to find a single wearable that has both smart alarms and continuous HR monitoring. Kind of crazy, right?"

Do you think that the One was accurate when it comes to calorie burning estimations, especially now that you have the Charge HR for comparison? I just don't know how heavily to rely on them and I don't want to derail my weight loss by eating back all of my ""burned"" calories..."
fitbit,3agi22,Jenjenmi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"I had a One for years. It will more accurately measure steps/distance than a Charge HR or any other wrist model.  For me, I wanted the HR/calorie info for all my non walk/run workouts (stationary bike, yoga, strength) so I am good with the trade off in accuracy.  Connect MyFitnessPal to Fitbit and see what you think of the calorie accuracy. You will get a weekly report via email from Fitbit of change in weight (assuming you log it into MFP or use an Aria scale like I do) and it shows your calorie intake vs expenditure. I have been seeing solid Fitbit calculations (like a 7000 calorie deficit for the week and a 2lb weight loss). However, I can't attest completely to calorie accuracy. I can't eat back exercise calories to get the calorie deficit I am currently striving for."

Barking and peeing everywhere until he acclimated enough to start training. So I biked to the store to get some almond milk, and then apparently I got home and fell asleep on the couch, still holding the almond milk...

Think about buying your laptop, you purchased it, didn’t need to pay another dime to the computer company to use the laptop and when this dies you will purchase another. Well Fitbit is moving away from this kind of sales. Yes, that is part of their strategy but they also are offering premium subscription models in the form of “Fitbit Premium”   This makes it sound like it's just a freaking sweet idea that i can't get full access to my data, even after paying $250 for a device. I strongly disagree, and wish they wouldn't screw over their customers like this."

fitbit,3agb2d,starrlitt1620,3,Fri Jun 19 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"I had a flex, upgraded to a Charge HR. I LOVE IT. Personally, I think the best valued one is the Charge HR, it's really worth the money. It is worth it in a lot of ways.    Heartrate monitor is more accurate with carlories burned, and it is more accurate with stationary exercise such as lifting, yoga, etc.  It has a screen so you can automatically see how much you've done, your HR, etc.  Automatic sleep mode as opposed to manual Counts floors climbed   The Surge is nice too. The only real drawbacks is that is kind of big on some people's wrists, more expensive, and has a shorter battery life. I personally don't think paying $100 extra dollars is worth it unless you are a serious athlete. For getting more active, the Charge HR suits your needs very well."

I'm very satisfied with the purchase of my Surge. I was going to get the Charge HR, but went with the Surge because I unexpectedly got some extra cash. I definitely do not regret that decision, the Surge is awesome, and having all your basic data (HR, steps, calories, floors and distance) visible right there on your wrist, is really awesome.

One of our extremely overweight secretaries filed a HR complaint for workplace harassment stating that she couldn't exercise and it upset her when she saw people wearing them. A few weeks later she went on medical leave for stress. After she left our supervisor put in 2 scales in the kitchen / break room, signs on the fridge proposing healthier food options with menus to local places and put fruit bowls all over the office that are refilled on Mondays. When the secretary returned she came back for a few hours then went home. Last I heard she's suing for workplace harassment and hostile work enviroment.  That's what you get for trying to create a healthier lifestyle in the workplace in America. But hey, still have my charge hr and free fruit!"

I don't use the ""smartwatch"" features of the Surge, so i cannot tll if they're worth anything, but the exercise/tracking features(HRM, dedicated exercise modes etc.) work like a charm.

The only thing that once happened was the screen looked a little glitchy, but a restart fixed it.  I really do like having it over the charge. To me, the largest obvious benefit was the GPS tracking. On a marked path, I found my surge to differ no more than a few hundredths of a mile than what the trail markings say. I've tried it with out GPS, and it wasn't nearly as accurate.  Another thing I found really useful is the text / call notifications. I'm a student at college, and I dont' really like carrying my phone in my pockets due to the size. But, having the Surge, I can preview texts on it to see if I need to bring my phone out. Same with calls.  So yeah, I've been really happy with mine over getting a charge.

The routine got a little boring after a while and I didn't get a sense of progress. After some googling I discovered Fitstar, which is exactly what I was looking for: a workout app that changed over time and got harder/easier depending on your level. If you get over the somewhat bro-y production style it is amazing. Long story short I am doing regular, intense workouts now, and it's what led me to get the Fitbit. (I'm also told the app can build workouts around injuries? not sure where that option would be but I heard it mentioned)  Cons for Fitstar is cost. So far it is acceptable though.

This is how a warmup run looks with my surge.

Not that I should really be taking medical advice from me, but if you see 15 evenly spaced restless events, you might want to check to see that you're breathing well. I think that's really the biggest concern.   If that's not the case then it might be something as mundane as a non-optimal mattress or pillow.

People who exercise more tend to have lower resting heart rates.   I guess it's because their vascular system is in better shape so the heart doens't need to work as hard to get blood pumped around.

It's actually really nice. We both do a variety of activities from simple moderate yard work or repetitive stair climbing at work to 30 minute Mossa Fitness routines. The Charge HR knows the difference and adjusts the calories burned for each activity.  I imagine that the Charge or other trackers without the HR would attempt to do the same, but I don't know how they could tell the difference between a 20 minute HIIT workout and 20 minutes of moderate cardio-kickboxing which has just as much arm flailing (well.. hopefully a bit more graceful than that)."

fitbit,3a78u3,shinjielric,4,Wed Jun 17 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"From my understanding when you're doing a deficit it doesnt matter how man calroies total you consume, you just need to burn off 500 more than you consume.  So if you consume 3500 calories one day, then you need to burn 4000 that day.  You say you take in 1,300 calories a day, then you need to burn 1,800. BUT...  Since you burned MORE Than 1,800 calories, it's essentially saying that you should consume some more beileve it or not.  You will not show green unless it is around that 500 calorie deficit. So since you burned MORE that's why you show in yellow.  Basically what it is telling you is that you can still eat more and be in the right zone. However it's up to you.  I realized I rambeled on and I hope this makes sense.  EDIT: 4000**"

fitbit,3a78u3,DJ_Molten_Lava,2,Wed Jun 17 23:53:29 2015 UTC,If you should consume 4000 calories per day then you are a very active person.  If you are so active that you are burning 4000 calories each day then I have no idea how you wouldn't be absolutely starving only eating 1300.
fitbit,3a78u3,malastare-,2,Wed Jun 17 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a manager as a local retail store and am constantly running around and throwing freight.

fitbit,3a78u3,DJ_Molten_Lava,2,Wed Jun 17 23:55:39 2015 UTC,"If you're running a deficit that huge, then you may actually have problems losing weight because your body may switch itself into ""famine"" mode and do whatever it can to reduce weight loss to try and make it through this period of low food availability.  You may be able to switch to a more aggressive weight loss budget, but even then, you probably do want to eat a bit more. I'm also routinely in the ""Under"" zone, but I try to keep it to be no more than 200-400 calories under. Some of that might be covered by the random bit of food that I forget to log, the rest just ends up being a little extra push on the weight loss.  But in general, your body and your doctor would probably want you to be a little closer to your budget than that. Fill in some of the extra calories with some healthy nuts. They're small and high in energy and protein, so they make for an easy work-time snack."
fitbit,3a7722,TeddieMao,2,Wed Jun 17 19:37:49 2015 UTC,Link mapmyride or strava to fitbit and then record your rides with one of the apps. This will add an exercise to your activities.   I believe it also negates the counted steps during that period
fitbit,3a7722,ubrkifix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"Why would he want to remove steps? The OP is specifically asking how to ensure that steps are counted, as he pedals his cycle.  So because his exercising of choice is cycling instead of running, he should show no steps?  BTW, I put my flex inside my cycling shorts, on my upper thigh. This ensures it reads the motion as I pedal."
fitbit,3a7722,jtbrown1,4,Wed Jun 17 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"The op was using the term ""steps"" because that is what the fitbit tracks and their goal is to track their exercise.  The way i see it petaling and stepping are not the same thing and the fitbit will not record accurately since it is being used outside of its intended purpose.   You want the steps recorded during cycling to be removed because they are not actual steps. The next time you drive somewhere take a look at your steps before you leave and when you arrive at your destination... you were not stepping but you will have steps recorded. there are apps that will allow you to easily insert driving times into your activity history to correct this."
fitbit,3a7722,ubrkifix,0,Wed Jun 17 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"Two problems with this approach:   I'm not going to consistently update this fitness app with cycling or, spinning, or whatever. Just like I don't take the time to type in everything I eat or everything I drink, this additional effort is unsustainable for most people except fitness addicts. Some of us use the fitbit as a way to track general exercise and movement. I don't expect it to be a perfect quantitative measure. That's why I want it to count while cycling, or whatever."
fitbit,3a7722,jtbrown1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:28:20 2015 UTC,If you use one of the cycling apps to record your rides it automatically punches in the information if you have the apps syncd
fitbit,3a7722,ubrkifix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that your steps are going to be wildly disproportionate. 30 minutes of cycling is going to equate to a lot more steps than walking, and more than running as well, however it takes a lot less exertion to bike at those speeds.    I use a stationary bike a ton, and just enter the time period I started and stopped, it's simple, doesn't take much time, and gives a much more accurate reflection.  If you count an hour of your biking leg movement as steps it'll think you ran quite a bit and exerted a lot more energy than you actually did.  If you really don't care about accuracy at all, that's fair.  Though I'm not sure what the point is then."
fitbit,3a7722,practicemage,2,Wed Jun 17 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree with your first argument.  I typically keep my RPM around 75-85 RPM, I know this because I have a cadence and speed sensor linked to my Garmin training watch.  I also know that my speed for my example ride is ~19mph.  With that, and my HRM, I know my average HR is 145bpm, which for my 25mile ride is 982 calories burned.  If I look at a running log that is about the same length of time (we'll use 1:10 mins because I just did that last wednesday) I ran 7 miles in just less than 1:10.  I averaged 152 steps per minutes (higher than my RPM) and my HR was also higher - 163bpm (admittedly, I am in better biking shape than running, I should be at 145bpm at that pace for running but it was a stressful day) and burned 956 calories.  So running was 956 calories for ~1:10 while biking was 982 calories for ~1:20...  Given the efforts, paces, HRs, and RPM/SPM, I'd say its a wash whether you wear it and count steps while riding...I think its fair game."
fitbit,3a7722,kmj442,-1,Thu Jun 18 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"But how do you define accuracy? What you're proposing is that any day I choose to cycle, my fitbit is essentially useless. I won't be able to hit 10000 (or whatever) steps if I go cycling for two hours and end up not counting that time as any steps.  Same concern for the elliptical.  I know, you're gonna say that fitbit is for measuring steps, not all exercises. And if you're going to be rigid about that, then those of us who cycle, etc, should just throw it away?"
fitbit,3a7722,jtbrown1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:26:09 2015 UTC,But fit bit is for steps? Cycling is not stepping? How can you even try to suggest you want steps counted for cycling when they are two completely different activities?  If you choose to cycle a heart rate monitor or the charge hr then will give you complete accuracy of calories burned if that is what you want.

I leave my fitbit on my wrist when I cycle to and from work (5.5km) and I get about 2,000 steps. Now if I ran that distance, it would be about 6,000 steps.

fitbit,3a6ijz,TacoBellBottomBoy,5,Wed Jun 17 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"Although I think it's awesome that Fitbit automatically tracks your sleep, if it takes you a long time to fall asleep the tracker won't log sleep until right around the time you stop moving. I like to set an event right as I go to bed so I know just how long it takes me to fall asleep.  I'm still trying to figure out how to use the data though. ""Yup, that's a lot of pink in my sleep graph. I guess this chunk of pink here is when I got up to pee.

fitbit,3a6ijz,Golden12345,2,Fri Jun 19 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the fact that it's a ""wear it and forget about it"" type of device. Yes, you're supposed to tap it when you go to sleep and tap it again when you're up for the day, but it's not absolutely necessary.  You can always review the logs and enter the times later.   I like that it's waterproof.  And that, once you get used to wearing it, that it doesn't interfere with your sleep.    One suggestion is that you experiment with the sensitivity settings along with which arm you wear it on. I found that I got better readings wearing it on my non-dominant arm on regular sensitivity.  But you might get better readings with another combination.    Overall, it's done a great job helping me to track and improve the quality of my sleep."

fitbit,3a6ijz,10KeyFrog,2,Wed Jun 17 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"It's mildly interesting, but not exactly the most actionable data.  It does seem reasonably accurate."
fitbit,3a6ijz,DJ_Molten_Lava,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:23 2015 UTC,So it can tell me how much I'm sleeping but probably not now how to get more sleep than. I wish there was something that did both in a convincing way :/
fitbit,3a6ijz,awaitforitb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get my Charge HR tomorrow. I'm also terrible at falling asleep (typing this at 1:10 am). What I'm planning to do with it is I'll experiment with amount and timing of exercise, coffee, eating (carbs/no carbs), bedroom temperature, lighting etc. and try to see how it affects the time it takes to fall asleep and how restful sleep I'm getting and try to make adjustments according to that data :) How it will go in practice.. well.. we'll see :)"
fitbit,3a6ijz,CheetahsNeverProsper,2,Wed Jun 17 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"My experience is that if I set the sleep tracking to ""sensitive"" it appears that I only get 3-6 hours of sleep a night. If I have it on regular it doesn't show how often I actually wake up.   Our toddler shares a bed with us and still nurses at night. Last time I woke up 4x to nurse her but since I latch her on and stay still it doesn't think I have woken up. I think I'll need to put it back on sensitive."
fitbit,3a6ijz,DJ_Molten_Lava,2,Wed Jun 17 18:52:28 2015 UTC,My favorite feature isn't as much the tracking as it is the silent alarm. I'm surprised more bands don't include it. It's the main feature keeping my wife and I with Fitbit.   We have a near 5 month old that we still get up to do an overnight feeding with. My wife and I alternate nights of doing it so other can get a full night sleep every other night. Silent alarm lets one of us wake up without disturbing the other with a noisy alarm.   My wife also gets up about an hour before me and is able to get up to get ready for work without disturbing me. We've been with Fitbit since early days of Flex and silent alarm is our favorite feature.
fitbit,3a6ijz,CheetahsNeverProsper,3,Thu Jun 18 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"What's bad about the Charge HR is a scenario like I had this morning.  I woke up at 6am, but didn't get out of bed.  My girlfriend's alarm went off, I awoke from sleep, but stayed laying down for another hour.  I rolled over a few times, put my arm around my gf, but stayed in bed.  My Charge HR counted me as being asleep for that entire hour.  In fact, it doesn't count my sleep being over until I sync in the morning, or get going with more vigorous movement.  In that sense, it's ridiculously inaccurate.  And I'm goddamn tired today."
fitbit,3a6ijz,DJ_Molten_Lava,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:30:12 2015 UTC,Happens with me everyday. I wake up and start reading news on my phone while laying on the bed. It tracks that in my sleep time as well. Overall it's not very accurate.
fitbit,3a6ijz,LeoNickle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:37:12 2015 UTC,"You can manually remove that time. I do that when the exact scenario you described occurs, or if I'm reading or something when I wake up."

fitbit,3a766k,ornryactor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"The company says a Flex should last five days on a full charge; less than that is indicative of a problem. (Seven days is too long to expect.) The number of steps you take is irrelevant to battery life. Turning off continuous syncing/Bluetooth syncing might improve battery life, but that's a total guess on my part with nothing specifically to back it up.   I called their customer support on a unrelated issue, and the lady noticed that my Flex had lost 25% of its battery in just an afternoon. She said that was clearly a battery problem, and sent me a new Flex in the mail without me even asking.  From what I've seen on a few of their products, I think their manufacturing process has some pretty major quality-control problems, but they're amazing about replacing devices that don't perform up to expectations (theirs or yours)."

fitbit,3a44zv,TheThirdStrike,5,Wed Jun 17 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"Ask to see the articles, and see if they come from reputable sources. As for the ""usefulness"" of Fitbit, that would mean they fall short of the desired outcome. Taken from the website, it would   ""help you stay motivated and improve your health by tracking your activity, exercise, food, weight and sleep.""   He is claiming daily walking and weekly cardio aren't as good as everyone says it is. Well articles with opinions don't hold a candle to published papers backed by the government such as the American NIH: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562968 or British NHS: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/pages/tools-and-technology-that-can-help.aspx  Whether it works or not is up to you. Will it motivate you? Will knowing how little or how much you've walked/ran today be enough to cause a change? You've been meeting virtually all the goals everyday, so I'd say it's not useless. Oh, and tell your friend to mention these articles on his next doctor visit and see how they react."

However, the way look at , I view my steps as a video game high score, so I'm constantly trying to do better than the day before .  If tracking my progress via the fitbit increases my physical activity, how can that be bad?"
fitbit,3a44zv,LastSummerGT,5,Wed Jun 17 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"Quite the contrary, the slightest positive effect on your physical activity due to the Fitbit means it's doing something.

fitbit,3a44zv,DrBrian,2,Wed Jun 17 06:17:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly.    Fitbit and similar products are motivational tools.  Nothing more, nothing less.  They don't give an accurate picture of your health, provide you with medical advice, or a perfect fitness regimen, but they DO have a habit of getting you off the couch and moving more, they DO get people to set activity goals, and they DO make you want to go further and further day after day.   I'm constantly pushing 20k steps day after day, and I really believe that without my fitbit it would be all too easy to spend the evening playing video games and otherwise being a fat shit that just didn't care.  Cutting the grass used to be something I dreaded but now that I know I'll get 7000-8000 steps doing it... no big deal."
fitbit,3a44zv,DrBrian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"I've been trying my hardest to meet all of the goals that is set by the device by default, and I can easily meet all of the goals except calories burned.   The calorie goals for most people are set pretty high by default.  Keep in mind that you burn more calories the more intense your exercise is and if you do something like aerobic exercise then you can log it into the fitbit app and get more credit for it than if you had just gotten the step count.  I actually set my calorie goal down a little bit just because the fitbit app was suggesting I burn almost about twice my BMR.  I edited it down to be about 1.5 times my BMR, which makes a bit more sense considering I was on a large calorie deficit.   Even if I had 20k steps and 120 active minutes I wouldn't hit the calorie goal."

A normal day for me is to lower my calories in the morning as I've been sleeping and not done much caloric burn.  Then as I get up and move around, it adjusts itself.  I have mine to sedentary and it will adjust upwards of 300 calories, but it will also lower as I start easing into the night and slow down a bit.  I normally end with 200 above sedentary."

fitbit,3a3ig3,GoodBandNameBro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"As long as you log in to fitbit with the same username/password it shouldn't matter what device you sync to, although there may be a conflict if are syncing to multiple mobile devices as Bluetooth pairing usually prevents two parent devices from utilizing the same child device (For good reason... imagine what chaos would ensue if you have two phones using the same Bluetooth headset, or two computers using the same Bluetooth keyboard!)  The fitbit itself doesn't lose data when you sync.  If you earn a bunch of steps, sync, and then have an issue with the app both the app and the information from the website should remember your step count, etc.   If this is not the case then I suggest uninstalling the app and then downloading it and setting it up again.  There may have been a problem during installation.  Keep the app to one mobile device and if you want to check your progress from the other device I suggest just visiting fitbit.com, as you see more detailed information there anyway."

fitbit,3a2ie5,jhawker66,3,Tue Jun 16 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"I use the Charge HR JUST to track calories burned. From personal experience, yes I have found the calories burned during an exercise are more accurate than the ""default"" setting. I do a lot of bike riding for example; putting in a set time riding will get me lower results for calories burned than what I actually did, mainly cause I push myself and my heart rate is a lot higher than what the ""default"" ride would be. Default bike riding is 80-90 BPM, I push myself up to 110-120 BPM, and doing that constantly for the same amount of time would obviously burn more calories. I do not record my exercises and just let my Charge HR do all the work of recording for me (I only record my intake of calories with mfp).  tl;dr: the charge HR is great for calorie counting and you should get it if you want to more accurately count calories."
fitbit,3a2ie5,invisible_robot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome response thank you! So then what you're saying is that, instead of entering in excercises you just don't even enter it you just let the sensor take care of it?

fitbit,3a2ie5,puppyduppy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"The Charge HR definitely tracks caloric burn more accurately than default settings. FitBit's default setting for my gender/height/weight is  1450 cals/day (so, if I forget to wear my Charge HR for a day, it tracks me at a mere 1450 calories burned). This is the same number I received from a nutritionist for my 'just living' caloric burn -- she said if I was simply laying down and blinking that's how many calories I would burn. When the nutritionist factored in my activity level, she said I should expect to burn 2000-2200 calories per day. This fits in with the data I receive from my Charge HR: on days I go to the gym, it indicates 2100-2300 calories; on days I make 10k steps but don't make it to the gym, 2000-2100 calories burned. That's pretty specific, but I've found it encouraging that FitBit's base caloric burn and my Charge HR data matches the information I received from a nutritionist."

fitbit,39yx5o,bitxilore,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"This might have something to do with the way that it tracks ""active minutes.""

fitbit,3a0rmq,sceiler,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:29:32 2015 UTC,Sensitive mode is only really meant for people with sleep disorders etc...
fitbit,3a0rmq,cyronius,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:03:23 2015 UTC,"Your Fitbit tracker's settings can record your sleep in either ""sensitive"" mode for extremely detailed sleep reporting or ""normal"" mode for a more basic idea of your sleep patterns.    The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users. The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep."

It figures out when you go to bed and when you get out of bed on its own. From my experience it's usually pretty accurate down to the minute.   I wear mine in the shower once a week to wash it. No impact whatsoever so far.   Heart rate from my experience is pretty accurate. Though after you first get it, there seems to be a ""break in""  period of a few days. Heart rate when I exercise is reasonably accurate, it just won't show changes is you're doing something extremely strenuous where your heart rate shoots up very quickly, it will lag behind your actual heart rate. Give it a few seconds up to a minute to catch up. If you're just doing cardio or jogging the heart rate (at least mine) stays pretty true."

fitbit,39ulso,floriane_m,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"Tap hard or button click on the left side. No you can't. The dongle is another way of synching your fitbit - not everyone has access necessarily to a computer or a phone so it's a good option to have.   A Damp cloth is good, esp if you tend to be a sweaty person it's good to keep the underside clean and dry. It's not water resistant like the Surge so I guess do it at your own risk. It will know when you have gone to be, I think it must keep track of your position on the horizontal plane and measures your sleep around that.  If you toss and turn it will show up as restless depending on what you have your sensitivity switched to. It is really good for measuring your HR, it can be a little inaccurate when your heart rate goes higher ie 160bpm-ish.  Some people have also said that they have been able to predict when they are coming down with something because of the HR measurements.   I have also signed up for the premium website access, it gives you good metrics for comparison to others in your age bracket / exercise range. Have fun!"

Even lightly will do.  No, you can't have the time displayed at all time, unfortunately. The screen takes up a ton of battery life (comparatively). The dongle is to sync with a computer. I don't use it at all. Definitely okay to clean it with a damp paper towel. Showering is FINE. I've been using mine for three months, and the only time I've taken it off was swimming (and charging, and cleaning, obviously). The major advancement of the Charge over the Flex (in my opinion) is that it automatically detects you're sleeping. It's not particularly INaccurate. As with the step monitor, as long as you compare it with itself, it's fairly accurate, and you'll see what you're asking."

The way it could help is if you use it in conjunction with Myfitnesspal to log all your food. Tracking is important for me, I haven't been on a run since the 13th, it says that, so now I can see how long it took me via GPS etc and try to beat my last time. It's a fun way to keep track of everything.    Is it necessary? No  Is it fun? Yes  Do I like to ask myself questions in this format? Perhaps a little too much  But I love tech, I have a bunch of it all around me, I got this along with some Bluetooth earphones, if you follow the Couch to 5K workout program it certainly seems to help keep track of everything.

The only exercise i get is a 6km bike ride to/from campus (12km total/day giving a ~400kcal burn), and somewhere between 8k-11k steps. I find it very hard to believe that i actually burn this much. At first when i got my Surge, I ate the amount of calories it says i burn, since I'm not really trying to loose weight. This ended up having me gaining weight, quite rapidly actually, so i had to adjust my calorie intake back down to normal. Now i should be loosing weight according to my fitbit, but it's holding pretty steady (and yes, i meassure everything i eat meticulously, and have the right calorie data on the ingredients in my food, I'm 100% sure of this). This has made made me conclude that the fitbit overestimates my burn for daily walking, since it tracks calorie burn during exercise very well, when compared to all the online calculators (some using avg HR, some not using avg HR) that I've compared it with."

fitbit,39rnvt,alymarie,2,Sun Jun 14 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"I trust my One more than my Charge HR but I've found for the most part both are quite accurate. The HR does have some quirks that make it over-count steps, particularly related to driving and large hand movements, but other than that it's pretty accurate.    FWIW however, Fitbit has multi-tracker support. You can wear both trackers at the same time and it will try it's best to reconcile data."

fitbit,39rc2y,sabbimerz,7,Sun Jun 14 00:19:10 2015 UTC,I like knowing my heart rate. It's an additional tool that Fitbit can use to calculate my calories burned more closely.
fitbit,39rc2y,PCBreakdown,9,Sun Jun 14 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"Besides the heart rate monitor, a big difference between the two is the fastener. The HR has a belt buckle style, the Charge has the Flex style fastener."
fitbit,39rc2y,DontWorryCarlos,5,Sun Jun 14 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"I like the HR because I like connecting changes in my heart rate to other things that are happening to my body at that time (ex: heart rate while sick with a chest infection, or during a stressful week at work)"
fitbit,39rc2y,meaganlodon,3,Sun Jun 14 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, the heart rate monitor is the only difference. It's good to know your heart rate when working out so that you can hit your target heart rate and get the best aerobic/cardiac benefit.  Edit: I forgot about the fastener difference, too! Thanks for reminding me, @meaganlodon."
fitbit,39rc2y,procrastinator7,2,Sun Jun 14 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"I like the HR because I lift.  If I were only to see my steps while at the gym it would be disappointing on lifting days, but seeing how my heart rate was elevated while lifting is nice."

fitbit,39rute,jhawker66,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"I paired MFP to fitbit. I like using the fitbit app to track activity and sleep but use MFP for food since their database is huge, adding/saving your own recipes is easy, and scanning a Barcode is faster. Besides that, your fitbit ""earned calories"", for lack of a better term, gets added to your daily calories on MFP. Since I'm trying to lose I stick to the 1200 cals so this doesn't do much for me, but I could see the benefit when trying to maintain a weight. I guess it's just preference."
fitbit,39rute,_TomEE_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:13:02 2015 UTC,"One thing I've noticed after a month of fitbit integration and little to no exercise, the Fitbit is giving me more calories from just a normal day than MFP does with just a ""sedentary"" setting, so my normal is not really 1750 (minus the deficit) but 1900.  So that was insightful.  i've not done anything with that information as of yet but I don't feel too bad if I got over 1750 a bit since that number comes from MFP's generic sedentary setting.  I do agree with everything you said about using MFP for everything but the exercise tracking and sleep."

fitbit,39puij,dlav_,3,Sat Jun 13 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"I use the Fitbit One. I love it. I work as a waitress and am training for the St. Jude Half, for which I count on my Nike Sportwatch. As a female I wear mine on my bra and can't tell it's there. The only downside is that the stairs counting can be a bit off sometimes. The steps counter is accurate as I've walked around counting my steps randomly and checked my counter and it's right on the money. I just found my first couple of friends after using it for a few years so, to me, the ""community"" is a bit weaker of a feature, but there is one. I guess you just have to be more pro-active. (I don't do much social media; no Facebook.)  The One does give you miles, active minutes, and calculates your sleep patterns as well.   And a year or two ago I lost mine in California and called the places I'd stayed (hotels) to see if I'd left it there (charging) and no one had found it, so I bought a new one. About 6 months after buying it, Fitbit sent me an email saying someone had turned it in and they would be mailing it to me, and they did!! (I can provide proof if anyone wants.) So, I highly recommend supporting this company if you're looking for a more sophisticated pedometer."
fitbit,39puij,reneelikeshugs,3,Sat Jun 13 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"*I purchased the Charge HR about 1 week ago. *I'm not sure if there is a community on here but I know that I have seen several posts with people adding eachother. *I am easily bothered by things on me. Socks, watches, sunglasses, hats, etc. I wear this watch almost 24/7 and it has yet to bother me. *I think it is fairly useful. I believe that it overcounts on the steps but that part isn't terrible as the Charge HR uses heart rate to determine calories burned. Or so I've been told. *This may be a special case but it has made my workouts more intense. I have bad anxiety and prior to getting the charge HR I refused to push myself in the gym. Every single time my body felt different I stopped and assumed it was my heart overworking. Now that I can see my heart rate I know that is not the case and I can keep pushing."
fitbit,39puij,Twifiter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"I guess the confidence that you'll be fine by being able to look at your heart rate would make you want to go harder.

fitbit,39puij,Markdizle,2,Sat Jun 13 22:31:46 2015 UTC,"I've had the Garmin vivosmart, jawbone up2 and the Fitbit charge hr.   The Garmin was a nice size, screen was difficult to read, app was ok, the notifications were cool but I decided I didn't need to be that attached to my phone.   I really liked the UP2 band, it was sleek and small. The app is horrible compared to the Fitbit app and that was my deciding factor to go back to the Fitbit. Also the band clasp kept coming undone, it was only a matter of time before I lost it.   The charge hr is what I stuck with. It's a bit bigger, has a normal watch clasp that won't come off but isn't too big. The heart rate sensor is pretty accurate every time I've checked it, although during my intense CrossFit workouts I don't think it accurately measures my heart rate as it never gets very high despite me working 100% but that's ok. It's nice to have the screen on your wrist to check steps, time, heart rate etc. battery life is suppose to be 5 days, we'll see if it lasts that long. The app is great and doesn't kill my 6plus battery as much as the jawbone did. It's not perfect but it's the best one for me"

fitbit,39puij,miniclubbin,2,Wed Jun 17 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"If you have the money, I highly recommend getting the Surge.   To be honest, I wasn't going to get it based on dcrainmaker's review, but my wife got it for me as a gift and I haven't found any of his negatives to have any impact on me. The GPS takes about 30 seconds compared to my Garmin that takes about 10 seconds.   Why this is better than a dedicated running watch: Activity and sleep tracking, 24/7 heart rate monitoring, and accurate GPS  I wear it snug and it feels just like a regular watch. Not uncomfortable at all. It is nice and wide, so the pressure from keeping it tight isn't as noticeable. My wife has the ChargeHR and needs to take if off and let her wrist rest. I haven't needed to do so, but I take it off and charge it daily when I shower just to keep the battery high.   Battery life on the Surge is longer than the ChargeHR without GPS useage.   I love the Fitbit interface. Their dashboard is really nicely designed and you'll see others starting to mimic them.   Sleep tracking is awesome and highly accurate. I set mine to sensitive and suddenly I know why I'm always tired. I spend a majority of my night restless.  I'm more inspired to run with this unit because it is so easy to track and seeing my results makes me want to do it more. I'm a techie though, so metrics are very interesting to me.   I haven't found the step tracking very motivating since I've always walked a lot during the day. However, being able to see my resting heart rate on a graph IS motivating because I want to exercise more to get it lower.   Compared to the other trackers out there, Fitbit seems to be more integrated with more 3rd party apps like food trackers and fitness apps. It automatically uploads my activities to my favorite apps (Strava, Garmin, MyFitnessPal). Their interface is intuitive and their devices have accurate heart rate monitoring without the hassle of a strap.   Get one of the HR models. You won't regret it."
fitbit,39puij,ThisIsSoIrrelevant,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"The things that detract me from the Surge is that I want to be able to wear a watch (other than the Nike one), and the fact that it just seems bigger and a lot more expensive, just to get GPS."
fitbit,39puij,in_the_making_,2,Sat Jun 13 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"The Charge HR and Surge both keep time and have silent alarms, so you wouldn't need a watch with them. The Charge HR display is off until you press a button to display time and the Surge always displays the time.   If GPS isn't a priority, I'd recommend the Charge HR. Heart rate is an awesome training resource.  Regardless, the Fitbit app is awesome. You can't go wrong with any of their models."
fitbit,39puij,paby,2,Sat Jun 13 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"I've not tried it yet, but you can use your phones GPS too with the Charge HR (you have to start your run via the Fitbit app for it). I know this won't be for everyone (need to have your phone on you) but it should help some people save on the extra for a Surge."
fitbit,39puij,ThisIsSoIrrelevant,2,Sat Jun 13 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"Currently using the FitBit surge and I'm in love. The ease of use, comfort and even handiness of having a watch, smart watch and fitness band all in one is wonderful. The seamless syncing with MFP is great and the gps run tracking is always fun and motivating! I check my map after running and basically set a goal to go an extra block or two the next run, my run never increased in intensity and duration like it does with the Fitbit."
fitbit,39puij,paby,2,Sun Jun 14 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I own the fitbit flex. I chose it out of excitement, I really want to upgrade to the Charge hr but I'll wait till I recover from surgery. I know it's a trending brand and it seemed like my best option for wanting what I was looking for without fidgeting with the other brands. It looks like the wearer community is growing, especially since they are doing a lot with marketing the product. I love mine. I use it to keep track of anything I do and do my best to track my calories and make sure I'm staying within the range I need to. It has very much motivated me to more more. Also, it is comfortable throughout the day. It took some time to get use to sleep with it for the sleep log. I'm not a huge fan of that part"
fitbit,39puij,KorbanDidIt,3,Sun Jun 14 05:17:10 2015 UTC,"I've owned my Fitbit Charge HR for just under a week. I'll tell you about my brief experience.    I went with Fitbit because they consistently have the best reviews online. As one review said, they're not like Nike or Garmin...fitness trackers are all they do.  I first bought a Fitbit Flex because I was afraid the size and strap on the Charge HR would be too uncomfortable. The very next day, I returned the Flex and got the Charge HR. I'm really glad I did. I like having the heartrate monitor and being able to see the time. I don't have to bring my phone with me when I take walks at work.  I don't find it uncomfortable. I have no issues sleeping with it or wearing it all day at work. The only ""inconvenience"" is having to take it off after sweating a bunch to dry it. Not a big deal. I don't wear it when I shower.  I find my Fitbit VERY motivating. I'm absolutely thrilled with it. I also use MyFitnessPal, and I just love the fact that MFP automatically imports my exercise data for the day.  I know you can easily get a free step counting app for your phone, but I think the convenience, options, and motivation the Fitbit provides is worth the money for me.  I love getting ""achievements"". I love knowing how many steps I've taken, and how close I am to the 10,000 steps goal. I also found the sleep monitoring to be really interesting! I don't wear it every night, but have worn it maybe 4 nights since I got it.  I don't know where you live, but I actually opted to purchase mine at Best Buy, since they have a 2-week return policy, with no restocking fees. I was a little nervous about dropping $150 on a fitness accessory, but I am very glad I did."

I set my step goal to 20k daily rather than 10k, but I'm not sure whether that helps or hinders me. For the first few months when my step goal was only 10k, I made it without fail, even if I had to walk on the treadmill at 11pm. Now that my step goal is 20k, I make it 6 out of 7 days a week on average. But on my rest day from running, I don't even make 10k anymore. I make maybe 8k or 9k, just sitting around the house all day.  Ultimately, I like my fitbit. It's fun. But does it change the amount I walk or run? No, not really."

I like to plan my meals out and with other food logs I've just entered all meals at one time but with the fitbit log it will say I'm ""over"" if I do this. I've started entering foods as I eat them and pay more attention to the remaining calories than the over/under message. If I'm at work, for instance, I know it will take longer to get ""in the zone"" bc I have a sit down job. And that's after eating only a 400 calorie lunch.

fitbit,39l8am,Webslung,2,Fri Jun 12 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"The only difference between tracking and logging is tracking gives you audio cue, plays your music and your phone GPS maps your route. The data your watch collects should be the same. As far as i know, if you don't map your run/walk through GPS(which you can't do on a threadmill since you're stationary) your step/km will most likely be off, since the tracker calculates this data by estimating your stride."

There is a term called ""maintenance calories""-- these are the calories you need in a day to maintain your weight if you live a sedentary lifestyle. In other words, you can maintain your weight eating XXXX calories a day, doing nothing. The calories you add or take away to that affect how much weight you gain or lose. So even though that number appears high to you, it is most likely accurate or close to."
fitbit,39hynz,cyronius,3,Thu Jun 11 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"As long as you've filled in your details correctly (age, weight, height etc) then it's pretty damned accurate (at least for step based activities).    Also, the distance walked is dependent on the stride length you've set on your fitbit account.  If you only took a guess at it or left it at the default, your distance may be off by a bit (but probably pretty close)"

fitbit,39j2kl,Schnabulation,3,Fri Jun 12 01:52:08 2015 UTC,"I am not 100% sure what causes it but I have noticed the same thing.  It also happens while biking if I am pushing / leaning on the handlebars.  My theory—which is totally conjecture—is that it has something to do with the way that tensing your muscles (esp. lower-arm muscles) changes blood flow in your wrist.  The Fitbit sensor is reading capillary dilation to determine heartrate, and it is probably thrown off when you start to get blood pooling in your arms.   Holding your hands above your head for a few seconds seems to get it working again more quickly than holding them at your sides, but I don't have a reliable solution."
fitbit,39j2kl,Kadin2048,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:48:13 2015 UTC,I didn't know the trick with the hands above the head - but it makes sense! I hope we can get further ideas. I was thinking on wearing the tracker on the leg right above the foot maybe - just for such workouts... I mean I don't really care about steps while weight lifting.  Another question: is the tracker counting steps while cycling? If so - accurate?
fitbit,39j2kl,Kadin2048,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"If it's on your wrists I don't think it really counts steps in any meaningful way when you're bicycling.  It's going to get incidental motion, maybe the swaying of the bike or something, but not really ""steps"" or even pedal rotations.  When I was using the Fitbit Ultra instead of the HR, sometimes I'd clip the Ultra to the bottom of my shorts while biking.  In that configuration it would count pedal rotations as ""steps"".  But it was pretty easy to get an absurd number of steps, and depending on the kind of cycling it felt, subjectively, like either a lot more or lot less exercise.  E.g. I had it there and did like 50,000 'steps' one day while riding a century.  I don't know if that's anything close to a fair equivalence."
fitbit,39j2kl,Grippler,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"I do weight lifting and biking, and I have no issues with my Surge reading HR. It did have a few issues with reading HR when I'm sweating a lot, but i just wiped underneath it with some tissue and it worked just fine again. I got a tip to spray some antiperspirant on my arm where i wear my Surge, and that has pretty much eliminated the problem.   My theory: I think the Charge HR has bigger issues reading HR than the Surge, because it's thinner, so more light can get in underneath the device, from the sides. That's maybe a little less likely to happen with the Surge, since it's wider."

I think you can probably pull it off but you might want to put some kind of wrap or something around your wrist to help shield it from stuff. I don't think the mud or little bit of water you're going to get it on it will hurt it but if mud gets under the sensor it'll stop tracking your heart rate.  Another option would be to carry a freezer ziploc and just tuck it away when you know you're going to do an obstacle that's going to be messy (Jesus Walk, Walk the Plank, or any of the crawling ones come to mind) and put it back on when you're done. That might be less crazy than trying to tape some nonsense to your arm.  Good luck and post the results if you do it!"

The first one I ran was the Mud Hero in Toronto and I made the decision to just see what would happen if I wore it like I would any other day. It did a great job recording the event but was incredibly difficult to clean. The mud got into the charging port and took me over a week to finally get all of the mud out of there so I could charge it easily.  Yesterday, I ran Mudderella with my wife and I took the precaution of putting a little electrical tape over the charging port and button. Again, it recorded everything I did beautifully (got my first Bridge badge). This time, cleaning was a piece of cake using a soft bristle tooth brush to get the mud out of the checker pattern.  I know that I'm putting the Charge HR at risk but these are the life events that I want to record with my Fitbit. I regularly play paintball while wearing it and enjoy seeing the spikes in my heart rate during games when I review the data later. If it gets scratched up or dirty, I'm ok with that and it's already done a great job tracking my improving health."

fitbit,396vvw,KetoThrowaway222,8,Tue Jun 9 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"Tension and a slightly different sleeping angle.    I moved the hammock up a single link on the chain, so about an inch, and that resulted in me rotating a few inches further clockwise in the hammock.  Tiny changes, huge result."
fitbit,39976q,thekojac,3,Wed Jun 10 04:05:42 2015 UTC,"the Surge is designed to function as a watch as well, so having another watch on your wrist seems redundant, not to mention stupid. I'f you're really just dead set on wearing your old wristwatch I would not get the Surge.   You could wear your regular watch on the opposite arm, but why wear two watches??"
fitbit,39976q,Grippler,2,Wed Jun 10 10:22:01 2015 UTC,"I actually just got the surge yesterday, and I was in this exact same debate, except I didn't have either. The Surge pretty much will be your watch now. So if you're extremely adamant about wearing your own watch keep the HR. The Surge is definitely too big to wear with another watch. So unless you wear the watch on one wrist and the Surge on the other, you can only wear one without looking ridiculous."
fitbit,39976q,Cslush,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:29:26 2015 UTC,This is exactly what one of my co worker does. he has the surge on one wrist and his watch on the other.
fitbit,39976q,MiltDuds,2,Wed Jun 10 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting, It doesnt seem like the watch serves much purpose seeing as the Surge doubles as a watch...."

fitbit,397qe9,LSU2,6,Tue Jun 9 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"It's huge because of the GPS.  You won't get a device with GPS that's much smaller (of any brand).  If you can live without the GPS, your options open up..."
fitbit,397qe9,cyronius,3,Tue Jun 9 21:31:22 2015 UTC,To the Charge HR which uses your phone as your GPS
fitbit,397qe9,CoachPop121,2,Wed Jun 10 01:02:29 2015 UTC,I don't believe the Charge HR is using my phone for GPS based on a few tests.
fitbit,397qe9,FiveSix,2,Wed Jun 10 09:37:09 2015 UTC,If you go into track exercise from the Fitbit app on your phone it will use the phones GPS.
fitbit,397qe9,redwingedgamecock,2,Wed Jun 10 11:39:41 2015 UTC,oh thats how you do it thanks been trying to find it  why no option for biking?
fitbit,397qe9,johnboyjr29,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:19:01 2015 UTC,There totally should be!! I just set it up as a run. I like tracking it on gps and to see how far I went and my heart rate. Then I'll confuse people and show them my 8 mile run at a pace of 4 min per mile hahah they never believe me though...
fitbit,397qe9,redwingedgamecock,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:45:38 2015 UTC,Oh I got you now. I thought you meant it just automatically pulls that data if you have your phone with you on a run. Your way makes total sense.   According to my GPS watch it is pretty accurate without the fitbit having a GPS
fitbit,397qe9,FiveSix,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple GPS watches and the surge is by far the smallest I have ever had, plus it does a lot of other functions."
fitbit,397qe9,meules,4,Mon Jun 22 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"I like the design, and found it much smaller when i unpacked it than i originally had feared. If you want a device with the same capabilities as the Surge, it will have pretty much the same size, but the design will of course be different. If you can live with a device without GPS, you might be able to get some smaller ones."
fitbit,397qe9,Grippler,2,Tue Jun 9 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it on in person yet, just watched YouTube reviews. Maybe the people wearing it have tiny wrists. I am 6'2"" so maybe it won't look giant on my arm. Will check it out"
fitbit,397qe9,Grippler,2,Tue Jun 9 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"I thought the same, but when I got it I was really surprised at how small it actually was.  I'm a 5'9'' male with regular sized wrists I think (I measured them to 18cm circumference at the wrist bone)"
fitbit,397qe9,jamjopeanut,2,Wed Jun 10 05:31:37 2015 UTC,I love everything about my surge except that I have to switch wrists every week to avoid skin rash. I'm very careful and follow directions but it still occurs. Who would have thought a non breathable material would cause problems on skin that requires air? Hmm
fitbit,397qe9,PammyLZ,2,Tue Jun 9 22:17:08 2015 UTC,I love the Surge too. I've been wearing one for 6 months now and all I can say I hope the next version is rounder. And maybe a breathable strap.
fitbit,397qe9,quikzx10r,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"I love the surge it doesn't seem to big, I just wish it ran android and had more smart watch capabilities."
fitbit,397qe9,cyronius,3,Wed Jun 10 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have the battery life it needs then...  You'd lose sleep activities etc, as you'd be charging it most nights..."

fitbit,397rpi,yamas,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Fitbits don't do app notifications unfortunately, only call and text...  It's one area where smart watches have an advantage..."
fitbit,397rpi,cyronius,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:03:21 2015 UTC,Maybe you could set an IfTTT to send you a text at certain markers?
fitbit,397rpi,marythegr8,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:21:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the IfTTT text message function is crazy slow. I set it up to send me a text for something, but I never recieved the text until 20-30min after the event had occured. Unless you recieve the text from IfTTT within a few seconds, it's going to be useless, since most of these C25K programmes use very short intervals for walking and running in the beginning."
fitbit,397rpi,Grippler,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:11:09 2015 UTC,I have a pebble and have run c25k on it while running the app on my phone so that I can get notifications on my wrist and see how much time is left on each part of the workout. You might be able to get an original pebble cheap now that the 2nd generation is out (I know the 1st generation was discounted to $79 on black friday last year).
fitbit,397rpi,ShainaEG,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:19:07 2015 UTC,"I dont think you can. It would be awesome if they included a function where you could create custom workout routines for interval training, so you wouldn't have to bring your phone on a run to keep track of that."
fitbit,397mp6,sonalis1092,2,Tue Jun 9 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"No, your flex displays the accumulated numbers of lightly active, fairly active and very active minutes (I think). You can see detailed data on this if you download your data from the website."
fitbit,398898,Hadesfalcon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, I linked my Fitbit with myfitnesspal and I agree, it was saying I could consume 4K calories like you, and lose weight, which didn't seem right.

fitbit,398jmv,jefftakeover,2,Wed Jun 10 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"I love mine. I've had it for more than two months and haven't had one issue. The only thing I ""dislike"" is that the battery life isn't great relative to the regular Charge, but an extra charging cable at work fixed that."
fitbit,398jmv,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:12:46 2015 UTC,Nice! Yeah I'm just worried about dropping a hundred fifty dollars on another device that breaks after a few months. The up24 I've had to have replaced every 2 months. So I wanted to check with current users and see if they've had any problems. Thanks for the feedback.
fitbit,398jmv,AlreadyThrownAway33,2,Wed Jun 10 01:23:10 2015 UTC,I think you'll be more than happy with the switch. I've heard a lot of similar complaints as yours about the up24.
fitbit,398jmv,dakboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:29:12 2015 UTC,Charge it while you're in the shower. I do it every day and it keeps the battery topped up.
fitbit,398jmv,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"I've seen others mention that. I don't mind charging at work while I'm sitting, when needed. It's just that the Charge HR battery doesn't last as long as the regular Charge, but I love the HR much more."
fitbit,398jmv,jarkarawr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:05:35 2015 UTC,How long does the battery last for you? I'm thinking about getting one as well.
fitbit,398jmv,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:06:44 2015 UTC,Depends how frequently I sync. Never less than 3 or 4 days.
fitbit,398jmv,Grippler,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"Do you have all-day-sync activated? Because I have it off and sync my Surge manually 3-4 times a day, I get 7-9 days from it, depending on how much exercise i track and if it needs GPS. I've never gotten less than 5 1/2 days from a full battery."
fitbit,398jmv,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:18:19 2015 UTC,"No, it's off, and I do the same thing you do. The Charge HR battery drains quicker because of the heart rate monitoring, which is a known issue.   I don't really mind, I just make sure to keep an extra charging cable at work."
fitbit,398jmv,pogafuisce,2,Thu Jun 11 10:37:50 2015 UTC,"The band on a Charge HR is not ""replaceable"" (like the Flex) is.  The device is built into the band and not removable.  I've had mine 3 or 4 months now, with no band issues.  I do check periodically where the rubber wraps around the buckle, because that is where I have seen people having an issue.  So far, so good :)"
fitbit,398jmv,pogafuisce,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:24:55 2015 UTC,I mean the whole device replaced via warranty. But thanks!
fitbit,398jmv,floriane_m,2,Wed Jun 10 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, well, it hasn't happened to me yet :)"
fitbit,3978jf,Nextelbuddy,3,Tue Jun 9 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same issue. I fixed it by adjusting my activity level in MFP (from sedentary to active), and then manually setting my desired calorie consumption goal to 1500. This fixed it right away, since the amount of calories rewarded by the fitbit, due to my daily routine, is much lower (around 200kcal). My exercise still adds bonus calories as it should, I just choose to not eat them back."
fitbit,3978jf,Grippler,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:20:52 2015 UTC,thanks! This seems to help! i did what you said by changing from sedentary to active and the fitbit synced calories in myfitnesspal changed to a lower number closer to my actual burned calories rather than my BMR. the con was that my myfitnesspal GOAL calories went from 1500 to 1990 but then I went into my GOALS area and changed my goal calories back to 1500 and it seems to be how i wanted now.  I will monitor and see how it goes the next few days. Thanks again!
fitbit,3978jf,stumblepretty,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"You can choose not to wear your FitBit except when you're working out, but as far as I know, it will always track your BMR and I don't believe you can turn that off. You can choose to not see your total calories burned and only view the actual designated workouts on your FitBit app/website dash, but that's the best you can do."
fitbit,3978jf,Grippler,2,Tue Jun 9 19:32:30 2015 UTC,You can choose to not see your total calories burned and only view the actual designated workouts on your FitBit app   How do i do this? I couldn't find that option in my app

You said ""after each time ... it just goes back"". So it works for a while? Might want to find out what causes it to go back, how long it takes, etc., to troubleshoot.   You can also add it so the double-tap shows you steps if that's what you're most interested in."
fitbit,393i97,absentdandelion,2,Tue Jun 9 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"My zip has been doing this for a whole month and a half now, it's definitely a glitch. All in one day it could be full, low, medium it's always changing. I have only had to change the battery once so far and that was after 5 months. I knew I had to change it because the screen wouldn't turn on obviosuly.   So just wait until you see that the screen isn't even turning on which in your case won't be for another few months"
fitbit,393i97,jhawker66,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well it was likely just lying in the factory for a while, then they ship it to a retail store or warehouse in amazon, third party sellers etc. The battery can drain just by being off too and we don't know what changes to temperatures it has reached. All could contribute to your battery. Another good assumption is that the manufacturer purposely fills it medium so it doesn't overheat. I wouldn't know about their zip line because I don't own one and these are just my guesses."
fitbit,393i97,kakistos2,2,Tue Jun 9 01:34:08 2015 UTC,"The Zip comes with a new coin battery. The battery doesn't come inside the Zip. If it did, OP may have been sold a used one."

fitbit,394cp1,NotBrittnye,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:55:27 2015 UTC,I have a long commute that messes up my counts so I found an app called drivebit. Basically you put in your driving times and it removes the steps added during those times.
fitbit,394cp1,akumanara,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:01:57 2015 UTC,Same problem here and Yes drivebit is pretty cool. But still you have to open the app and hit start and when you go down press stop.   Drivebit support tasker (if you have android) and i was hoping maybe i could automate things using iBeacon technology.   The idea is this: You can put a beacon in your motorcycle and have an app monitor when you are really close to your motorcycle (~< 0.5/1 meter) and start the drivebit and you move away stop it.

fitbit,3946wo,Grippler,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:06:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. All I know is that on Auto when I take it off and put it down the lights stop.
fitbit,3946wo,thirddayiii,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"when you take it off it stops tracking after ~1-2 seconds, so if it tracks something (in those few seconds), it's so few datapoints. The HR data is only only saved in 5min intervals, so a few seconds of false readings will have no effect. Note that it only stops tracking if it's lying still, if you put somewhere and it's not lying completely still, the tracking will resume. I've had my Surge set to both auto and on, and they seem to produce exactly the same HR data."

fitbit,392e3d,sodiumlaurethsulfate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"Normally you'd be lowest in your sleep, and a little higher on waking.

This means ANY kind of pressure decrease, combined with some continous movement, can get counted as flights of stairs climbed.  By doing it this way, they are VERY sensitive to driving with open windows (or up a hill), going in/out of buildings with different airpressure than outside (from AC for example) etc.   I don't think they can do all that much to increase the performance of this, since it's really just a shitty way of measuring such small inclines in altitude, in shifting conditions.

fitbit,393ja0,lazysystemsadmin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Yep.  This was my experience as well.  My first had a bad sensor and was missing thousands of steps.  Emailed support, they gave me some troubleshooting tips, nothing worked, and they replaced it with a picture of the receipt.  Not only that, but the replacement one had a dud battery (Guess I have bad luck).  The email support guy put in a new order within 48 hours, and I was back up and running within a few days.  No shipping charge, they didn't even want the defective ones back."
fitbit,393ja0,porksandwich9113,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:50:00 2015 UTC,See I have a defective one.. They didn't ask for it. Which I thought was weird. The only issue with mine is has a dead pixel in bottom left.. Doesnt affect the watch. So I now have two surges.

So I called fitbit customer service and was instructed to send them the same info they asked of you. I received an e-mail from them in about 4 days saying they would send me a new one, and got the new one two days after that. I hope they make this right for you - you may want to tell them it  just straight up doesn't work so they don't give you the reset run-a-round."

They sent me the same email 4 times and I started to complain about how confused I am then eventually they started the process to replace the device.   In my opinion it's best to do the update via a computer and not by a phone. There is some problem with updates via the mobile app.

I think my flex held up better, but my knockoff white band is forever blotchy - pink. His Charge had cornstarch in the cracks for a bit, but was all around OK.  Bit of advice: If you're paranoid about it getting damaged, but are too lazy to wrap/cover it (like me), put your arms up when running through the wet parts (yes. liquid colored cornstarch, baby!). Your fitbit is meant to take A LITTLE bit of moisture (like when you sweat/when it rains) so if you get some runoff on it, it will be fine."

fitbit,38yvvx,Grippler,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:56:32 2015 UTC,But why would you need detailed second-by-second HR data when not working out? I simply don't think they save that much data when not in workout mode
fitbit,38yvvx,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"How high your HR gets is a measure of how hard you are pushing yourself, while the lower your resting heart rate is a measure of cardiovascular health.   GPS data is not collected when not in workout mode. HR should be continuous (an average per minute, iirc)"
fitbit,38yvvx,Grippler,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"yes but what is the point of knowing how hard you're pushing yourself, when not working out? Resting HR is calculated for you and displayed in the app.   Furthermore, why would I want a GPS log of my everyday movements?"
fitbit,38yvvx,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"If it is a lot of work for your heart when you are doing nothing, that is not good. But good cardiovascular strength / health is a long term goal.   As far as GPS, nobody does. It is simply activated when it detects a workout."
fitbit,38yvvx,sodiumlaurethsulfate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"Indeed they don't save that data. I don't necessarily need second-by-second (though I'd love that!), but every five minutes makes it hard to account for error or do any decent analysis."
fitbit,38yvvx,Grippler,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Having it save data every 5 minutes when not in exercise mode gives you nearly 300 data points per day. For something that requires a sample taken over a long period of time, that should be sufficient to make an analysis over  1-2 weeks worth of data. Resting HR is not something that changes that much from day to day, but is mostly noticeable over longer periods of time."
fitbit,38yojm,bozco19,2,Sun Jun 7 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"My charge HR seems to be off by about a quarter of a mile. I'll run and my gps says I run 4 miles, my charge hr says I ran 3.75 or so. I've measured the distance with a couple apps and I think the software is off and not the device itself.   Perhaps fitbit updated their app recently and messed with how they calculate distance."

fitbit,38yojm,cosmik_debris,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"As you have increased strength and flexibility, your stride should increase. Run a known distance, longer the better, then divide the distance in inches by number of steps taken to get average stride (inches per step). Log into fitbit.com and add it to your user profile."
fitbit,38yojm,adelie42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"There could be two very different problems here:  1 - The screenshots you've posted are from a GPS tracked run.  The Flex itself does not have GPS functionality and your phone was doing all of the work here mapping your run here.  You will get variances from using a phone to track your runs because the tracking on phones isn't as sharp as many devices.  Sometimes you are using cell towers to triangulate your location and not true satellite-based GPS.  When this happens, you can see variances based on who your cellular provider is, how remote your location is, and how much bandwidth your phone may be using at the time for other services.  My fiancee and I have used both the fitbit app and Nike+ to track runs.  She is on AT&T and I am on Verizon.  We are right next to each other for our typical 3.5 mile route, yet by the end of it I've registered an extra 1/4 mile most times.  You can see in the first image you've posted that the lines are much rougher than the second one you've posted.  Those little wiggles in the paths don't seem like much, but those little distances add up.  Additionally, the first one seems more true to the roadway than the second... you're being shorted on the second because it looks like you are running to the inside of the roadways.    2 - If you were using your Flex to track mileage and not GPS, there can still be issues with it.  Fitbit estimates your stride based on your height.  It only knows the average for your height, it doesn't know actual unless you set that.  You can update it on the fitbit website (but you can't do it via the app).  You can set different stride lengths for both running and walking.  I suggest going out to a measured area and calculate these things.  A nice running track is perfect and most high school football stadiums have them open to the public during the day.  Once you set this and sync your app you should start getting more accurate numbers on the dashboard of the fitbit app.   It's important to remember that most Fitbit models are just accelerometers and that all they can do is detect motion.  Most models can only estimate steps, mileage, flights of stairs, etc. based on the movement relative to the tracker.  These aren't the super futuristic devices that some people think they are.  All things considered, it's actually fairly low tech.   Although they've obviously gotten much better and much smaller, accelerometers have existed since the 40's."
fitbit,38wi3p,clearintentions,4,Sun Jun 7 12:38:15 2015 UTC,Does surge use gps for the floors?
fitbit,38wi3p,kanishk_singh,3,Sun Jun 7 13:59:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know really, but I know it's crazy accurate. The second I take a final step up a flight of stairs it changes."
fitbit,38wi3p,kanishk_singh,4,Sun Jun 7 14:09:49 2015 UTC,My charge hr is based on barometer so not as accurate.
fitbit,38wi3p,SpaceIsTheShit,5,Sun Jun 7 14:23:53 2015 UTC,"The Surge uses an altimeter as well. GPS is only enabled when you do exercises, the battery life only lasts about 5 hours with GPS activitied. At least that's what Fitbit claims but I haven't left mine on for 5 hours to test. Fitbit's help page explains that it counts a floor with continuous movement over an elevation gain of about 10 feet. So if you're climbing floors less than 10 feet then it may not register as a floor."

fitbit,38wwj1,FitnessRegiment,3,Sun Jun 7 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"The Surge can do all of the things that you listed above.  On the mobile app, you can view all of your heart rate data for the whole day as a chart.  If you wear the Surge to sleep, it will automatically track your sleep. It tracks how many hours you slept, plus the quality of your sleep based on your movements throughout the night. It also will use your heart rate while sleeping to determine your resting heart rate and you can view that as a chart (resting heart rate each day).  The Surge automatically tracks the steps you take, but also the distance travelled (in miles or km). As you walk throughout the day it automatically tracks this. You can also start activities on the surge (which include walking and running) that will use the built in GPS to track where you walk/run which will give you a very accurate distance travelled over the course of the activity.  Based on your age, weight, and gender, the Surge and Fitbit mobile app will track how many calories you've burnt throughout the day (pretty accurate with the continuous heart rate monitoring). You can also use the mobile app to input the food that you eat throughout the day so you can see how many calories you've eaten vs how many you've burnt. This is helpful as well if you set weight loss/gain goals so it will tell you if you're on track for your calorie intake throughout the day based on how much you've burnt and so on.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask!"
fitbit,38wwj1,Minhaul,3,Sun Jun 7 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"To add onto this comment, I made an imgur album that shows you some of the things you're asking about from the mobile app:  http://imgur.com/a/2FLr5"
fitbit,38wwj1,SpaceIsTheShit,2,Sun Jun 7 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can get an accurate chart of your daily HR info Yes it tracks sleep autimatically, no need to do anything Yes, it uses a default value for stridelength to calculate distance run/walked (it can be changed to fit you if you know/measure it). If a run or walk is tracked with GPS it uses this to determine distance. My Surge calculates calories burned during exercise very well, but i suspect it estimates calories burned thorugh my daily routine too high. (it says i burn 3500kcal on the days i exercise, only about 800kcal of those are exercise, my BMR is ~2000kcal). Daily routine is 8k-11k steps.   If you haven't already, I suggest you also take a look at the Basis Peak, they've recently released major updates that fixed som major issues.   I'm VERY satisfied with Surge, and I can definitely recommend it!"
fitbit,38wwj1,Grippler,2,Sun Jun 7 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"What's the basis peak? I also love the surge, let's me know how to train for tennis, when I'm wearing out in the match so that I can simulate my match heart rates in practice and then try to push through those barriers in practice. I beat a guy today that I haven't beaten in about five years today thanks in part to my training with my Surge."
fitbit,38wwj1,TenNes,2,Sun Jun 7 20:05:08 2015 UTC,Basis is the company making a much similar fitness tracker called Peak. It tracks pretty much the same things. Check it out at their website www.mybasis.com

fitbit,38wwj1,Grippler,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"So 2700 + 800 = 3500.   Seems pretty accurate, no?"
fitbit,38wwj1,AlreadyThrownAway33,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"But TDEE accounts for calories burned through exercise already, there should be no need to add them again. That should give me this: 2000kcal + 800kcal + (whatever calories walking 8k-11k steps takes). That means I should burn 700kcal just by walking, not fast or anything, just daily walking from desk to toilet and back, office to office etc. and that seems very high for something that takes no effort and doesn't raise my pulse above 85 BPM.  on the days i don't workout, and hardly even leave the apartment or my couch, i still get a ~3000kcal calorie burn, and thats days with 6k steps or less. It just seems like it's overestimating this daily routine calorie burn a lot.  EDIT:   When you exercise or simply expend energy through physical activity, you burn additional calories. When you combine your BMR with the calories you burn through physical activity, you get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure.   Taken from here"

fitbit,38tgnz,juryben,2,Sat Jun 6 17:53:45 2015 UTC,I am pretty happy with the Charge HR reading of my heart rate during walking or running. I know it can get iffy for things like strength or boxing workouts from what others tell me.
fitbit,38tgnz,Jenjenmi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:03:17 2015 UTC,"Who knows what will be in the future?   We they have 5 products in production now, zip, one, flex, charge and surge, and the lady two just came out, so I wouldn't necessarily expect something new this year.   But they are putting no R&D into the software side of things so maybe they are on something new.   At least I would prefer to think that than they have abandoned us older users forever."
fitbit,38tgnz,Pamzella,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:33:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly think close to Xmas this year, and no later than March 31, 2016. My reasoning is as follows.   1) filing an ipo means they have stockholders and will now require to report quarter and yearly reports. Yearly for most companies end not in December but the end of March. So I am willing to bet they will release new products to spur sales and please stockholders. I am leaning more to end of the year for Xmas. Trackering market is huge now and I saw them everywhere last Xmas. I doubt they will want stale products compared to everyone else.   2) ipo will infuse a large amount of money into the company very quickly. I can see this helping.   3) the look of their products hasn't changed much in a few years. A charge hr is a slightly bigger flex with a bigger display. I think they realize they will need a change.   I bought an HR to upgrade from a regular charge but I need an extra large which is still out of stock. So I returned it and just waiting till they release new products. Sounds like you are in similar boat with the flex. Also the Hr during workouts sounds like t needs to improve for most people so holding off might be good."

The box will tell you how to set it up, it's simple; just plug the dongle into your computer and make an account. Install the fitbit app on your phone and if you don't like fitbit's calorie counter you can get myfitness pal. Not sure about being paid to workout."

Anyone got an idea for a case/holder design that would be superior to the basic clip, and appropriate for a man to wear?  Those gold bracelets were a valiant attempt, but look both effeminate and rather over the top trashy.  WOULD a dog tag pendant be a good idea, or would it lead to a huge number of tracking errors?  I'm half tempted to do a leather gauntlet!  Or hide it behind a large chunk of turquoise, since I have a good sized cabochon, but hiding it seems wrong somehow.  Embrace the technology, don't hide it away.  I'm considering how to approach this.  Heck, even size isn't an issue.  Big isn't a problem, fundamentally, so long as it actually functions properly."

I had to take a screenshot of my bestbuy purchase history and take a picture of the damage with a note with the claim number written on it. They sent a new one right away and I had it within a week. If you don't have proof of purchase I think you have to mail the broken one in first before they send a new one.

After a few days of calling everywhere I went, and nonstop searching, they sent me a new one for free.  They have awesome customer service, just be nice and send an email asking what can be done.  Take pictures of it with good detail and provide them with your account email so they can help you! Good luck!"
fitbit,38rbx7,pokeaotic,7,Sat Jun 6 03:47:09 2015 UTC,"Step 1: set up a customized food item called ""100-calorie food"". Nutritional information: 100 calories per serving.  Step 2: check restaurant's nutritional information. (Virtually every chain with more than 3 locations has this on their website these days.)  Step 3: record it as 100-calorie food. (So if I ate 800 calories, I had 8 portions of 100-calorie food.)  Saves you the need to create custom meals every single time you eat something that isn't already in the system. It's definitely worth doing custom dishes for things you eat regularly, but for a place you only go once a year..."

fitbit,38rbx7,dysproseum,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:34:33 2015 UTC,Why not just log it? If you use MyFitnessPal and sync with Fitbit you're more likely to find whatever you're eating. Otherwise make an educated guess and just add the calories if you can't find the nutritional info for what you've eaten.
fitbit,38rbx7,johnsmith44444,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:55:10 2015 UTC,I'm a HUGE planner!! When I know I'm going out or ordering out I check out the nutritional guide before ordering. If its a local place that's not on line I look for a similar order.   One thing I've been eating every week for a while is a local place's spanakopita - I eat half and take the other half w/for lunch the next day. I highly doubt there's only 35 calories in it because of the size so I double it and fill like that's a good guestimate. I honestly have no idea though! LOL   Other than that one I feel pretty good about the others.

The added bonus of meassuring resting heart rate is a great way of finding out if you're getting in better shape in general.   Its only £20 extra for the Charge HR, so I'd definitely buy that one.   EDIT: If you've just gotten into exercising seriously and on a regular basis, the HRM can really help you optimise your workouts. I started working out a few months before getting my Surge, and i've experience that i push myself harder and further, after I got it, because I can see if i'm not in the right HR zone."

fitbit,38mtmb,for3cas7,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely go with the HR. Especially since you are just getting into excercising, HR is easy to understand and very important for setting up limits during excercise. (example: look up extensic interval training. HR must not go over 150bpm and you can take breaks until bpm drops to 130 so you have to get moving again. This is extremely important training to get into cardio without getting injuries and still burning fat)   Hope I made it a bit clear. There is a lot more to it but I can't stress enough to definately pick up the HR for yourself."

It's the same with the Surge, even by moving my hands as i type this, it's enough movement to activate the HRM. The LED's require VERY little power, the powerdraw is probably only ~45 mW/LED with a total powerdissipation of ~60 mW.  I've had no problem with batterylife even though it's pretty much on 100% of the time during the day, i still get at least 7 days from my Surge."
fitbit,38n3to,Grippler,1 point,Fri Jun 5 08:15:18 2015 UTC,It is the same for me. It is always on indeed. Kinda annoying at night aswell. My guess is to keep an average to get a most accurate estimate of your actual HR when you request it.

I used to get ~1000 steps/2 hours programming, this scewed my data quite a bit by the end of a day.

This decreases the sensitivity a little, and I haven't had any issues with it after that, and it still counts actual steps correctly."

fitbit,38jiu1,thirddayiii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:38:16 2015 UTC,The waiting time only happens on my phone too (Android). PC works right away
fitbit,38jiu1,thirddayiii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:54:17 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/a/y63K9  And you don't see this on your phone?
fitbit,38jiu1,thirddayiii,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't start an exercise because I was at the gym, and I tought I needed to actually move so the GPS recorded it correctly. I just pressed the button.  Il try that tomorrow thanks!"
fitbit,38jiu1,thirddayiii,2,Thu Jun 4 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"OK then. Maybe I'm beating a dead horse but just to clarify, if you have the charge, it doesn't have GPS. You press and hold the button to start the workout and then press and hold when done. Be it the workout is 10min long, two hours, or a day."
fitbit,38jiu1,Schnabulation,2,Thu Jun 4 18:43:29 2015 UTC,Just got off the phone with Fitbit support and they say that the real problem is that the Charge is not registering the exercises as workouts... But they know the problem and are working hard to release a firmware update  Thanks for your help
fitbit,38jiu1,BTBishops,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:45:10 2015 UTC,Nice! No problem. Hope it all goes well.
fitbit,38jiu1,BTBishops,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:04:23 2015 UTC,Can you specify that? So you did actually start and stop the exercise mode on the charge but it did not record? Do you maybe know if this is the same with the Charge HR?
fitbit,38jg7n,lardasspsycho,3,Thu Jun 4 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"First thing I would do is put it in a bag of raw rice. The rice draws the moisture out, but it doesn't always work. If it does die contact Fitbit, don't mention what you did just that it's not working. I washed my old Fitbit one and did this. They had me send my receipt and they sent me a new one no questions asked, they didn’t even have me return the old one."
fitbit,38jg7n,ActuallyAmbah,2,Fri Jun 5 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't worry at all, I ran through the detailed help and forums of the Fitbit website and it turned out that the device is perfectly waterproof. They only advise you to remove it while showering to let your skin ""rest"" for 15 minutes a day. I've been logging my swimming workout without any issue for 3 months :)"
fitbit,38jg7n,fireoyster,2,Sun Jun 7 12:09:36 2015 UTC,You swim with it??
fitbit,38jg7n,Teriblegramer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"You'll probably be ok, but monitor the device over the next week.  That's typically when you'll see any adverse effects."
fitbit,38jg7n,Big9erfan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:09:16 2015 UTC,As a techie I would say if the display still works the other sensors will do too. Normally the display is the most sensitive component that breaks the first.  But as mentioned - keep an eye on the data...
fitbit,38jg7n,Schnabulation,-2,Thu Jun 4 21:47:21 2015 UTC,It will slowly rust internally and eventually die.
fitbit,38jwsc,TenNes,4,Thu Jun 4 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure your court movement will be mapped very accurately when you move within such a small area. But if you really want a GPS log of your movement, I think ""free run"" is the best way of doing it yes."
fitbit,38jwsc,Grippler,2,Thu Jun 4 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty surprised with the accuracy of the GPS so far, for example I can always tell when I have to stop and pick up dog poop off the side of the trail."
fitbit,38jwsc,Grippler,2,Thu Jun 4 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have really good experience with the GPS as well, it might work really well on a tennis court too, I'd definitely give it a try."
fitbit,38jwsc,Grippler,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Either way I'll post tomorrow what it looks like, I figure people might want to see for whatever reason.   I wonder if I should break it down into three ""workouts"" 1. warmups, 2. set one, 3. set two.   Otherwise, over the course of a couple of hours it will just look like a big ass blur.   Can the watch retain 3 different work outs worth of GPS without syncing? I'm wondering if it will sync while my phone's in my bag."
fitbit,38jwsc,dakboy,2,Thu Jun 4 19:18:50 2015 UTC,That would be a great way of doing it! Yes they Surge can store 7 days of detailed info.
fitbit,38jwsc,Schnabulation,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Oh that's awesome, this is pretty much the primary reason I got the surge, so I really want to try it out a few times and decide if I want to keep it or not.   The only other thing I'd want it for is doing HIIT on this really basic spin bike I bought. The bike was cheap as hell, but it basically has no monitoring system except for mileage and time, but it's pretty awesome, super solid construction and I think an 80 lb flywheel. It will be funny that the device I use to measure my HR on the thing will be more expensive than the damned bike itself."
