attackontitan,3dtcp6,Coopernius,4,Sun Jul 19 09:22:03 2015 UTC,It's worth it to read the manga. The anime drops off around issue 33 and you can pick up directly at issue 34. It instantly gets way crazier in the manga.

attackontitan,3dkdva,OgreLordShrekMcGee,3,Fri Jul 17 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"I came here worried that people would be saying this looks good. So much wrong. First thing, what about the European influenced architecture? I always found that aesthetic really interesting from a Japanese animation."
attackontitan,3dkdva,stevemachiner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"European medieval castle style architecture.  This could be good, done right, but to be honest I think you'd have to spend a ridiculous amount of money to get AoT to work in live action. You need too many high quality visual effects for the movement systems and combat that just isn't going to work without a very high budget. With a low budget they'll just look cheesy.  It'd be interesting to see what the studio behind some of Marvel's newer movies would do with some animes, they've done a good job of keeping them true to the comics while entertaining for the alternate medium."
attackontitan,3dkdva,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"I would say its a little later than medieval, mid Renaissance maybe."
attackontitan,3dkdva,stevemachiner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:26 2015 UTC,Yeah. I can see where you're getting that.  AoT: http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16169/4118369-attack-on-titan-city.jpg  Renaissance: http://cdn2.kidsdiscover.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/9.jpg  Perhaps you could consider a combination of both? Those wooden frame buildings you see in the very centre of the AoT image are VERY medieval England: https://ilovehippolines.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/medieval-buildings-copy.jpg  I'd say the castle architecture is more renaissance while the regular town buildings are definitively medieval.

Having seen what Hollywood's done to Anime in the past and the success of the Kenshin series I'm totally OK with them making this a home grown product.  Sure it's not going to have a hundred million dollar hollywood budget, but I'm okay with supporting this film. I hated Isayama's art style but his narration made up for that.  Regards to people complaining about race, Western people are well represented enough in films. I don't mind seeing more Asians in cool roles. Literally every other film is friggin catered to Western audience why should a film in Japan do the same? With the budget of the film I'm sure they'll make more than enough money from it through Asia. If anything I'm sure some exec or producers in LA will spend some money and re-do the script for this series in a couple of years anyways."

attackontitan,3caux5,SOS_Music,7,Mon Jul 13 12:29:29 2015 UTC,well..the show was intended to be the first season and if you were expecting some satisfying conclusion... sorry cant help you. the show isnt cowboy bebop or trigun where you have a self contained story told within 26 episodes. Dont worry though! the second season will answer all those questions and bring up some others!
attackontitan,3caux5,shadowofthetitans,6,Mon Jul 6 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"The last episode of the anime wasn't written to be a season finale, its just where they happened to stop in the story. The next season deals much more with the nature of the top government and the history of human/titan struggle"
attackontitan,3caux5,TravisB5643,6,Mon Jul 6 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"It was very definitely written as a season finale, complete expanding on the events from the manga to make it a more epic climax to the season.  What is was not written as is a series finale."

It's the first season of a series that will have at least three, maybe even four, so obviously they're not going to show their entire hand during the first one."

attackontitan,3caux5,darcnavyseal,0,Wed Jul 8 23:59:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just got done binge watching Season 1, and I really don't see why everyone likes this anime.    It's hard to get invested in the characters when they seem to kill off half of them every episode.  I mean I get that humanity is on the verge of extinction and the titans vastly overpower humanity, but at this rate how can they have any kind of a fighting force left after a few more episodes?  The whole 3D mobility device seems odd.  Like I get why it would be useful inside the city, but after 100 years of no titans inside the city you'd think they'd prep better for battles outside the walls.    When the Scout forces do go outside it seems like it's mostly all flat land where the 3D mobility devices are useless, except one patch of tall trees.  I understand avoiding the titans, but for the forces that specifically go outside the walls, you'd think they'd come up with something better.  The tactics they use are incredibly stupid for the most part.  Like why not try to trip titans, or bind their arms before you go in for the kill move.  It took them to the last couple episodes before they got the idea of hamstringing the titans.  Can't they come up with a longer distance weapon to attack the titans, like a saw blade that they can fire?  Those rope fired spear things seem like they'd be awesome against any titan, and most of the titans seem too stupid to think to pull it out, so it seems like it would be an effective tool for immobilizing titans.  The action, when there is action is nice, but all to often it seems things are way to dragged out, and there is too much talking / inner dialog during what should be fight scenes."

Think of dragon ball, the avatar,... Often because they try to make it like the series with special effects. For example, the avatar had earthbending, which I thought was really cool. In the real life movie the earthbending was done once, by 6 guys doing the same synchronic dancing move, and then lifted a small rock in the air which I could have lifted myself  to...

For me reading the manga is twice as exciting than watching the anime, because I imagine the second season will be released on Netflix when it's out (correct me if I am wrong) and for the cliffhangers you will have will be found out as soon as you watch the next episode. BUT imagine having to wait a month or so at a time to find out what's going to happen next. Discussing and debating with others on /r/ShingekiNoKyojin as to what will happen. It's just as much if not more exciting than watching the anime."

Personally I think it's worthwhile to read the manga as it's a bit more explanation in it. If you liked the world and the mysteries I recommend it warmly.

Just kill everyone I love. LIKE ALL OF FUCKING Levi SQUAD! ok that wasn't a question. But I'm still hurt.

attackontitan,3619m9,notsoclassyadventure,3,Fri May 15 10:25:12 2015 UTC,I'd say give Tokyo Ghoul a chance. It's what I watched after AoT and it caught my interest much for the same reasons AoT did.
attackontitan,3619m9,brockoo7,3,Mon May 18 07:42:08 2015 UTC,You can find the manga at your local book stores. Yes you will have to read right to left. It's not as weird as you would think. The mangas are really fast reads since its like reading a comic book. There are 15 volumes of the series and a few side stories as well. This was my first Japanese anime and was blown away. I watched death note after and really enjoyed that as well! Haven't found any other anime as good to those 2 just yet.
attackontitan,3619m9,Limitless08,2,Mon May 25 06:58:12 2015 UTC,I literally just finished AoT last week and started to watch Death note! So far death note is so good. Need more of AoT though :(
attackontitan,3619m9,brockoo7,2,Sat May 30 15:58:13 2015 UTC,There is ova episodes of AOT. Back story for Levi. You can find them on torrents. There's like 6 episodes I believe.
attackontitan,3619m9,ErkiB,3,Sun May 31 04:00:47 2015 UTC,Good for you!

attackontitan,35zffi,ShiningGundamu,1 point,Thu May 14 22:56:12 2015 UTC,I can't check my game because I'm at work but do you happen to know how many kills the top spot holds atm?

attackontitan,35zffi,Leufinwaffle,1 point,Thu May 14 20:32:38 2015 UTC,"So far I love it.  The story mode did feel a little bit lacking to be honest. I would of enjoyed an original story, but once I started playing it was really fun playing through the story from the manga/anime.   World Mode however I can go on for hours, I'm just simply addicted to killing Titans and upgrading my gear. I wish I had a few dedicated friends so I didn't have to keep jumping from lobby to lobby, but hopefully that will change soon."
attackontitan,35zffi,ivl3i3lvlb,1 point,Thu May 14 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't play through the whole story mode. Ive seen the first season like 4 times...   WORLD MODE now.... This is wild to me. I've progressed all the way to second layer of special missions.   I'm at level 47, but still feel like there is SO much to unlock.   I feel like all of the reviews on this game are garbage. They talk about the repetitiveness that you experience for the first small portion of world mode.  The meta of this game is a gem. The boss fights? Let me tell you... you will NOT get an A+ on any of them without the help of real people.   They are an opportunity for the game devs to update the leaderboards for TEAM boss clear times.   It will make all of the items way more relevent, as they will be SUPER useful.  anyways, still plucking away, trying to unlock all of the beauty this game has to offer."

attackontitan,35ty09,ShiningGundamu,2,Thu May 14 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"Just powered through story mode and I'm tearing into the meat of World Mode, and I'd say it's pretty damn fun. The motion all feels right, though the game is a bit simple. Great for a quick pick up and play sorta entertainment.   That said, the price tag does feel a bit steep for what you get. But what you get is high speed, wire flying, titan cutting, trap setting, just about to be eaten goodness.   It's not visually impressive, especially stacked against stuff like Monster Hunter (goddamn those visuals!) but you get what you see in the shows, minus the mental side of things."
attackontitan,35ty09,speelmydrink,2,Thu May 14 08:10:36 2015 UTC,is it worth playing if I don't have a New 3ds? I heard it depends heavily on the c stick. Is this true?

attackontitan,35ty09,kingbabycat,2,Sun May 17 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"C stick definitely helps, but is not required. Use the L trigger to center camera.   World mode is so incredible. It's pretty much an AOT rpg. You level up your character, gather different recourses whilst avoiding abnormals charging at you.   You build a team of soldiers, which will grow affinity for you after each mission, which makes them jump to your aid if you're in trouble.   I'm having a blast.. And if you can get some of your friends to join in, then you will be really having a blast."
attackontitan,35ty09,Poolcaptain,1 point,Fri May 15 08:58:34 2015 UTC,I bought this game the day i posted it and haven't stopped playing since. I stopped story mode for awhile once i unlocked world mode and i fucking love this mode. Its like the captain of pools said it really is an AoT RPG. and that's incredible.
attackontitan,35ty09,Jaitnium,1 point,Fri May 15 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the game personally, but based on the gameplay videos I've seen: It looks like a game that was thrown together and is  relying on the hype of AOT in order to make sales."
attackontitan,35qpje,Iliad_Keys,12,Tue May 12 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about that kind of stuff, how do they compress the air into the tanks? They must have access to some seriously strong and light weight metal that can hold air compressed so tightly that it will propel you forward when released."
attackontitan,35qpje,Stolen_FBI_Van,12,Tue May 12 20:11:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's all written about in the before the fall short novel. The containers are made of an incredibly hard but lightweight material called iron bamboo, and an ice burst stone (compressed frozen gas that occurs naturally) is put it. The ice burst stone then expands rapidly as it reaches room temperature, filling the container."

attackontitan,35qpje,m0nky,7,Sat May 16 04:01:44 2015 UTC,"They don't have organs, genitals, or for the most part, any higher intelligence. They are also mostly hairless all over apart from their heads (except for 1).  I don't think its too much of a stretch to assume that they don't need a barber.  Edit: They seem to just be locked as a vague representation of the human they were created from"
attackontitan,35qpje,Tamond_NC,2,Tue May 12 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"There's one titan with beard. Also if you want sheets, read the manga"
attackontitan,35qpje,oskartzon,2,Wed May 13 12:30:32 2015 UTC,"Well many people above me have already wrote some pretty darn good comments as to why the titans have the head of hair they have.  My two cents is that they are not human. I'm not going to go into spoilers here but I do know about the storyline in the manga, which easier explains why they are how they are. Nevertheless, why would their hair have to grow? I mean think about it. They have no reproductive organs nor digestive systems, so why on earth would you believe that they would have what is needed to grow hair? The best example is that whenever you see Eren turn into a titan, or Annie turn into one, they always have the same set of hair. Their titan form has a head of hair already set for them. To put it simply, they are no cavemen, as they are not human, even though... ya know.... don't wanna spoil too much but the manga does explain the titans very well.  Honestly, it is not a mystery at all, even when I started the series myself from simply watching the anime. While I was indeed confused at first about the titans, when it was revealed that they have no reproductive systems and no digestive systems, everything made much more sense."

When he handed the lady the arm, he said ""This is all we could find of him.""  She knew that her son was dead when she saw that he wasn't there when they came back, and the arm was proof of that.  She wasn't traumatized at all by an arm, she was traumatized by finding out that now she'd never see her son again."

attackontitan,35bedb,raxel82,2,Sat May 9 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"But they do know that the titans are there, and the whole reason the Survey Corps is in such a bad light at the start, is due to heavy casualties coupled with minimal ground gained back. The people know that the Survey Corps is Russian Roulette mixed with a dash of suicide, and everyone who's anyone is gunning for spots on the police force or the wall guards.    Coupled with the fact that due to all the miasma surrounding the Survey Corps, and their abysmal status, I don't think they much cared anyhow if the severed arm in burlap was a shock. I think that it went beyond getting a mother back her son's remains, and illustrated a point to the people as a whole, of ""This is what we deal with daily. We fight, and we push, and we strive for us all, and this, THIS is what we have to show for it. Another one of our own, dead, and barely anything left to even bury"". Complete and total shell shock within the unit. Utter defeat, looming over them constantly. A well trained soldier, who is supposed to be of the highest caliber, reduced to nothing but a single body part.

attackontitan,352mdk,xRyNo,34,Wed May 6 16:13:41 2015 UTC,"Let's be real, they are all disturbing....I can't even imagine what that would feel like being hunted and destroyed by something that big."
attackontitan,352mdk,theprophecyMNM,11,Wed May 6 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that's how the majority of animals feel but humans don't care as long as there is nothing bigger than us hunting us on the streets."
attackontitan,352mdk,Arvidselts,6,Wed May 6 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"Still, animals are generally hunted and hunt other animals. Humans haven't had to experience that in thousands of years."
attackontitan,352mdk,Link_GR,4,Thu May 7 08:25:40 2015 UTC,"Is this not obvious? It's a very unsubtle philosophical point the show makes about captivity, breeding, farming and the powerlessness of animals we bread in captivity for food.  The show even makes a very strong statement about humanity apparently not knowing where the walls came from.  It's not a new depiction. We've done the grass is greener, inside-looking-outside philosophical view of talking animals from inside captivity in animation before. Complete with some of the animals preferring the quiet safe life that they have inside the walls with absolutely no desire to know the outside. Complete with those that it's a false safety and they're not safe within the walls. And so on and so forth.  If people take a moment to think about the show and stop simply drooling over the fantastic animation, battle scenes and so on, the actual points and depictions it's making are very obvious and as blunt as a hammer."

attackontitan,352mdk,Zaeh,2,Fri May 8 03:31:15 2015 UTC,mah bad
attackontitan,352mdk,Demonlordofpies,1 point,Fri May 8 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, I wasn't directly comparing the two, simply making an obvious statement on how the animals that are being hunted might feel. Whether or not the animal is killed in a humane way or ripped limb from limb is irrelevant, they will be killed by a human and eaten. What is humane in this world is created by us, humans. Animals don't feel the sameway, as for the majority of them, mercy doesn't exist, the strong eat the weak, like titans do to humans, as it is instinctual for them."
attackontitan,352mdk,Arvidselts,0,Sat May 9 00:43:50 2015 UTC,"The most humane way of eating any prey is to of course kill it first, and in all fairness, some titans did kill humans on the show before eating them. However, it's important to keep in mind that people do eat animals that are still moving on the plate, especially popular in Japan where octopus is served seconds after being killed, still moving on the plate. Also, titans are not smart, they are not like humans, the only ones that could be compared to humans are those titans that are actually controlled by humans, like Eren's titan form or the Female Titan. For example, the Female Titan did not eat a single human, it simply killed the ones that stood in her way. The other titans, regular ones if you will, they don't know any better. They don't have a fully functional brain to even think properly, as they are like the majority of animals, driven by mere instict. Also, in the animal kingdom, many animals instantly eat their prey, even when they are still alive, a logic that could be applied to the majority of titans as well."
attackontitan,352mdk,Arvidselts,0,Sat May 9 00:40:43 2015 UTC,Thing is they aren't sentient. An animal merely fears death out of instinct.
attackontitan,352mdk,doughboy011,1 point,Sat May 9 09:30:33 2015 UTC,And people don't? Yes they do. Fear is the most instinctual quality humans have and that's a fact.

attackontitan,3486id,WindWakerFTW243,9,Wed Apr 29 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"It's not the best connection, but I had the ending of Lost ruined for me before I started watching it and I still loved all of it. AOT is a good enough show where it's worth it to keep watching."
attackontitan,3486id,future_dolphin,5,Wed Apr 29 03:22:12 2015 UTC,the story of aot is yet to be told in the source material so the ending cant possibly have been spoiled for you or anyone else
attackontitan,3486id,niizuma,3,Wed Apr 29 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"There are no big revelations in the last scene, just one big reveal in the last couple of eps.  The biggest surprises are in the 1st 12 episodes.  I'd say watch it.  It can't be spoiled by revealing any plot twists. The anime, story, and characters are all great."
attackontitan,3486id,fanamana,2,Wed Apr 29 03:39:53 2015 UTC,And the next 12 to come. =P
attackontitan,3486id,KillZacular,3,Tue May 5 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yuppers, should some jaw dropping wtf moments quick into season 2.  Regardless of the wtf revelations coming, I think anime only viewers may get a little frustrated with the lack of mythological answers in season 2. It sorta felt like we were about to get to the bottom(or basement) of some mysteries as season one closed.  In the continuing story shit just gets more crazy, confusing, and obscure for a long time.  Real answers are just starting to reveal themselves now."
attackontitan,3486id,fanamana,2,Tue May 5 13:27:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. Poor anime watchers are going to be on season 3 before anything starts making any sense.
attackontitan,3486id,KillZacular,3,Tue May 5 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"The biggest ""reveal"" in the last episode comes after the credits and its more of a question than an answer ^  If that is indeed the last scene you are refering to"
attackontitan,3486id,kane49,2,Sun May 3 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"Well I dunno, it seemed like a pretty BIG spoiler and I hadnt watched the last episode yet, I just assumed it was the last scene since he said it was the last episode."
attackontitan,3486id,kane49,2,Sun May 3 13:54:15 2015 UTC,Just tell me which scene you mean XD i cant answer you question without knowing the scene and i cant ask you exactly which scene without spoiling you further XD
attackontitan,3486id,kane49,2,Sun May 3 17:54:57 2015 UTC,When Eren dies or something and becomes a Titan

attackontitan,33rvmm,hyper10n12,3,Sat Apr 25 00:54:08 2015 UTC,So what did you think of the whole Eren and Annie being titans?
attackontitan,33rvmm,Leufinwaffle,8,Sat Apr 25 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was mind-blown the majority of the series because everything was happening so fast and sudden and basically it was always ""WTF!?"" and ""OMG!!"" for me. With Eren, I was so shocked because I never expected that to happen. I just saw him get eaten a couple of episodes ago and I remember thinking ""What the hell!?"" ""What's gonna happen now!?"" ""Did he really die already!?"" Not to mention everything else that was happening with his friends and the emotional state they were in. With Annie, I had no idea at first but I suspected after seeing the way she fought Eren as a titan. Plus she was MIA so that raised my suspicion some more. I'm also interested in finding out more about how she became a titan. We already know at least some of Eren's (his Dad is somehow involved, and maybe responsible for Eren being a titan being a doctor and all). I can't wait for the next season to come out because I'm dying to know more about the basement, both the identities of the colossal & armored titans, and more conspiracies haha.  EDIT: Spoiler tag"
attackontitan,33rvmm,Leufinwaffle,2,Sat Apr 25 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"That's exactly word for word how I felt watching it for the first time. Although waiting each week for a new episode really sucked hard aha.  If you don't want to wait for the new season I'd suggest buying the manga, there is up to volume 15 available in North America(and I think UK, but I'm not to sure). I just dropped $150 on all the volumes just to have them for my manga collection, I just finished reading volume 15 and all I can say is season 2 is going to be amazing!"
attackontitan,33rvmm,Leufinwaffle,3,Sat Apr 25 03:30:52 2015 UTC,Oooh I think I'll buy the manga!
attackontitan,33rvmm,morbidmauller,2,Sat Apr 25 03:55:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you should. I bought them to read at work because for the past little bit it's been super slow, and I kinda plowed through them in a week and I think its a few months till volume 16 comes out :("

attackontitan,33kmzw,alwayslurkeduntilnow,17,Thu Apr 23 07:55:53 2015 UTC,"Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood - It is an amazing anime which is on UK Netflix.  Two brother's go on a journey to reclaim parts of their bodies, but get involved in something much greater.  No sexual content or anything like that - The main character is very similar to Erin and the mystery of the Titans parallels the mystery of Alchemy.  It's my first and still my favorite anime ever  EDIT: Just finished Gurren Lagann and it's taken the top spot of favorite"
attackontitan,33kmzw,Mahowee,6,Thu Apr 23 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this, thankyou.  I look forward to watching it."
attackontitan,33kmzw,ErkiB,3,Thu Apr 23 19:47:49 2015 UTC,Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the greatest anime of all time.
attackontitan,33kmzw,Zaeh,10,Sat May 2 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Quite ironically Attack on Titan isn't really post-apocalyptic (we don't know exactly what it is yet, but it's presented more as an alternative history / fictional setting), but there are some other anime that are have proper post-apocalyptic settings.  If you're looking into just anime that are similar to Attack on Titan thematically and tone-wise, series such as Berserk and Claymore (and Knights of Sidonia) should be decent."
attackontitan,33kmzw,Turtlegalore,2,Thu Apr 23 08:50:33 2015 UTC,"Brilliant, I will have a look."
attackontitan,33kmzw,shrxz,3,Thu Apr 23 09:15:44 2015 UTC,Highly recommend knights of sidonia

attackontitan,33kmzw,marimbaspluscats,2,Fri Apr 24 00:16:33 2015 UTC,Berserk is incredible but the manga goes on for MUCH longer than the anime and even crazier stuff happens. The problem is that the author is going through some really serious writer's block.
attackontitan,33kmzw,k311y0h,7,Sun Apr 26 23:16:00 2015 UTC,I would recommend Death Note! It's not post apocalyptic but it's really good. It also has the same director from Attack on Titan.
attackontitan,33kmzw,seanmccabe1993,6,Thu Apr 23 20:34:48 2015 UTC,First Anime  I watched and I loved it.
attackontitan,33kmzw,musicalbutts,4,Thu Apr 23 22:32:36 2015 UTC,I only started watching a nine recently because of AoT. As others said Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing. Death note is very  good too. Code Geass is another I would recommend.
attackontitan,33kmzw,musicalbutts,3,Sat Apr 25 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Gantz after attack on titan, its a bit out there sexually and gore-wise but its a great show! claymore has already been suggested, but I enjoyed that one a lot too."
attackontitan,33kmzw,kevinisthename,2,Thu Apr 23 09:10:03 2015 UTC,Thanks but I aim to avoid sexual elements of this genre.
attackontitan,33kmzw,lusien,2,Thu Apr 23 09:15:27 2015 UTC,"fair enough! in that case I second claymore :) I'm in the same boat as you, looking for more AoT-type shows"
attackontitan,33kmzw,firebathero,3,Thu Apr 23 16:01:47 2015 UTC,A show that I enjoyed a lot that is somewhat similar is The Armed Librarians: The Book of Bantorra
attackontitan,33kmzw,SuperAlbertN7,2,Thu Apr 23 16:20:50 2015 UTC,Try hellsing ultimate  It's a cool alternative history anime
attackontitan,33kmzw,musicalbutts,2,Mon Apr 27 17:09:59 2015 UTC,I would say a similar anime would be Neon Genesis: Evangelion. A bit more deep but it's a great anime that I think has held up over the years.
attackontitan,33kmzw,SuperAlbertN7,-2,Thu Apr 23 20:59:58 2015 UTC,Well I will always recomend The Legend of Korra to anyone. Not that it's a lot like AoT but it is an amazing show.
attackontitan,33kmzw,musicalbutts,3,Thu Apr 23 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"I would recommend avatar the last airbender over Korra probably, it was 10/10 and Korra was hard to watch D:"

As a result of her not understanding the proper procedure and then her offering him part of the potato (Which he acted surprised using sarcasm) he made her run laps until the sun set as punishment."

That said, other animes I have enjoyed are: Deathnote, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho-pass, Swort Art Online, and Kill La Kill."

Kill La Kill is effing nuts and on acid all the time but has unbelievably well done characters. Kill La Kill is an action comedy with great personality."
attackontitan,32augr,KillZacular,-1,Tue Apr 14 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly have to disagree. I don't think there is much depth to.. really, any of the characters in AOT/SNK.  Could you explain to me what characters have what depth? (I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just curious if maybe someone else saw something I didn't.)"
attackontitan,32augr,totallyknowyou,5,Mon Apr 13 00:34:39 2015 UTC,"Considering there are only 25 episodes out (not counting the bonus releases) I'd say there's a quite a fair amount of character development. I grew an immediate attachment to Eren's character within the first two episodes, which is why when he was eaten by a Titan in only the 5th episode it was an extreme shock.  I feel like Eren's character is often too curious for his own good, which is why he fights so passionately against the Titans - he is the only one willing to truly give up his life in revenge for others' deaths and because he craves the outside world more than anyone else.   Eren's relationship with Mikasa also has an emotional back story. They care so much about one another, perhaps Mikasa more so for Eren because she owes him her life and she sees him as her only family left; she has almost an innate instinct to protect him at all costs.  Annie's character development lacks, but conveniently so since she comes off very stoic and has her own secret priorities above all else.  Is Annie's character really so emotionless? I don't think so, I think there's a lot to uncover about her (hopefully in the second season). It appears there's a rough past she has with her father, but her love and promise/devotion for him keeps her focus on completing her mission (whatever that may be). When she's in titan form, even her titan cries.  A lot of people complain about Armin, but I don't hate him at all. I think he portrays innocence genuinely well and he's very brilliant minded, especially for a 15 year old kid. I think he serves as a small symbol of PTSD; no matter how much training you go through, all the preparation in the world doesn't mean you can handle war.   Granted, I do feel as if this anime revolves more around the present-day storyline rather than backstory (we just have so many questions about how and why certain things are happening which keeps us interested). It is more difficult for people to become attached to characters when they haven't watched them literally grow up (there's a huge time lapse in AOT between the attack on Eren's village and when they become cadets). There have been few scenes reflecting on difficult times in the past.   There's also an episode where the scouts are training and each gets a slowed scene with a description of their abilities - this also contributes to their character development a bit."

' I personally think One Piece is very good. Excellent story and great characters.   If I were you I would watch Sword Art Online. It is the same length as Attack on Titan and very good. The idea behind the story is really good, and the story itself is pretty good too."

attackontitan,32augr,Reborn4122,2,Mon Apr 13 00:34:22 2015 UTC,What's SNK?
attackontitan,32augr,jnogueras,4,Tue Apr 14 04:00:42 2015 UTC,Shingeki no Kyojin. The Japanese name for Attack on Titan.
attackontitan,32augr,SaiyanSoul,5,Tue Apr 14 04:30:07 2015 UTC,Oh! I'm such dumbass. Haha. Thanks for being nice.
attackontitan,32augr,jnogueras,3,Tue Apr 14 12:29:59 2015 UTC,"This is the wrong sub to ask. I hate to be someone who generalizes, but mist SNK fans are kind of.. weird. They like Americanized shows that are pretty bad(someone suggested Naruto shivers visibly).  I will compose a list of shows that the greater anime audience finds to be the best shows around here, in no particular order:  Cowboy Bebop  Samurai Shamploo   Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood  Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex  If you have yet to see any of these, I'd seriously recommend them. After seeing even just one of them, you'll most likely come to the conclusion that SNK is actually a decent show, but just not a great one like the above 4.  If you are looking for a list of more modern ones, I can give you one of my personal favorites (they haven't been around long enough for the anime community to give some sort of concensus on them). I will arrange this list in order from my most favourite to least.  Terror in Resonance  Your Lie in April  Tokyo Ghoul  Aldnoah.Zero  In my opinion, these shows except for the last one are better than SNK but still don't come close to the 4 above that I mentioned already."
attackontitan,32augr,totallyknowyou,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:05:57 2015 UTC,How is terror in resonance? I watched the first few episodes but i felt it lacked direction. Did i stop just short of some attention grabbing material?
attackontitan,32augr,DJWhyYou,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's pretty awesome. I enjoyed it for reasons that you may not be looking for though. I liked the pretty visuals, the soundtrack, the setting, and the overall production and environment of the show.  As far as a plot, there is one for sure, but it sort of takes a while to get there. For a 11 episode show, I don't think it's that big of a deal though.  Overall, the plot isn't very strong, but it still makes for something entertaining. If you lost interest within 3 episodes, then I can't really say that you would enjoy it.  How far did you get exactly?"

I don't remember what happens in each episode but I know at some point I felt the same way about him and then it changed. You also have to keep in mind he's gotten the most kills out of everyone in the scout regiment by a large margin so it's safe to assume he's seen horrible shit and that's why he acts like a dick
attackontitan,3265tc,Alphonse1596,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:40:31 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Mike had the most titan kills. He was part of the military years before Levi joined and was also considered the world's best soldier at the time.
attackontitan,3265tc,dankry,2,Tue Apr 14 04:01:54 2015 UTC,Idk on the wiki all it says is mike is considered humanities second strongest fighter after Levi so I would assume Levi has more kills but I could be wrong
attackontitan,3265tc,Alphonse1596,2,Tue Apr 14 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"That's why. Levi is a freakishly talented, but Mike is very efficient and has more years of fighting titans under his belt."

The question he presents to Eren is 'Who do you think is the real enemy?', and I don't think it's related to the above.  Erwin didn't know for sure that there would be a Female Titan, but he knew that there was a high possibility that a spy was within their ranks, and that the spy would go after Eren due to him being a shifter. He also thought about the possibility that the spy would be a shifter as well, hence all the counter-measures in the forest."

attackontitan,324uz7,12secondcountdown,3,Fri Apr 10 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Erwin asked this question to a lot of the high-ranking troops who were at the scene of the crime of the slaying of Bean and Sonny. Basically, Erwin was looking for people who had the same suspicion as he: that someone among them sneaked into the city during the events 5 years prior. If you understood the question, Erwin knew you had the same suspicion and therefore could be trusted, as a traitor would likely play along with the popular belief that a crazed titan-hater must be the culprit. You could also be trusted if Erwin knew you before the fall of Maria.  During the recruitment presentation, Erwin seemed to spill a little too much information about the Scouting Regiment's plans. This is actually because he suspected the traitor was among those listening, and he wanted the traitor to try and pursue them on their outing. Those in the know knew that the outing was an attempt to lure the traitor out of the walls, and into Erwin's trap. Everyone else just thought it was a trial excursion."

attackontitan,31t99p,dankry,3,Thu Apr 9 18:55:03 2015 UTC,Why do we need to combine names in a ridiculous manner to describe a couple?
attackontitan,31t99p,RoboWarriorSr,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:19:09 2015 UTC,I've never been a part of ships and I find it pretty ridiculous too. I've just never wanted a couple to become canon as much as these two.
attackontitan,31t99p,Jaynight,10,Fri Apr 10 16:40:35 2015 UTC,At this point it's not whether Mikasa like Erin but when will Erin realise. Hopefully the mangaka won't fuck up or he'll lose a significant reader base.
attackontitan,31t99p,RoboWarriorSr,8,Wed Apr 8 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly expect a bitter sweet type thing here. For Eren to achieve his goal Mikasa will have to make the ultimate sacrifice and give her life protecting him while he saves the world.  I really see that ending coming because honestly I dont see Eren and Mikasa living to see the ""new"" world when and if it finally happens."
attackontitan,31t99p,Jaynight,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:21:33 2015 UTC,I meant that the mangaka has one chance and he better not pull some ending like Tokyo Ghoul Root A.
attackontitan,31t99p,RoboWarriorSr,2,Wed Apr 8 02:26:49 2015 UTC,Ya I like to pretend Tokyo Ghoul never had an anime adaptation. Such a disappointment.
attackontitan,31t99p,Maledictor86,2,Wed Apr 8 02:36:37 2015 UTC,There like 30 good shows this season that will make up all of last season. Last season had so much potential that fell flat. shutter
attackontitan,31t99p,Jaynight,2,Wed Apr 8 02:45:40 2015 UTC,What happened in the anime adaptation that was so bad? (I've only read the manga)
attackontitan,31t99p,niizuma,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:39:54 2015 UTC,Beside the poor quality in the actual animation. Season 1 was a alright but kinda poor adaptation so with season 2 they decided to call it a anime original which was fine but it ended up following some points from the manga enough to be considered a very poor adaptation and not an anime original.
attackontitan,31t99p,Spoygg,3,Wed Apr 8 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, I hope they do end up together, it'd be cool"
attackontitan,31t99p,niizuma,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:03:40 2015 UTC,the first chapter of the manga calls that into question especially the first time we see future mikasa

attackontitan,31t99p,dc295,3,Wed Apr 8 09:30:43 2015 UTC,"I think she has feelings for him in a romantic sense, but also views him like a brother. The series could honestly take it either way. I could care less if they ever have a go with any sort of love interest ordeal though. Didn't exactly take a liking to the show/manga for the lovey dovey stuff."
attackontitan,31t99p,mathmistress,3,Wed Apr 8 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"personally, i think they've boned before."
attackontitan,31t99p,thebronyknight,2,Wed Apr 8 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"She blushes during the take back the trost arc and her leader called him her boyfriend and she blushed saying he's family so that's one major point. The second is while the female titan was flipping out attacking the city and the main 3 were underground, Eren said he couldn't kill a certain girl (being vague just in case) and Mikasa got pissed and asked him if it was because he might have feelings for her or something (at the very least it was heavily implied so you might want to double check that and sorry if it's wrong). I can see the points your friends are making and they definitely make sense (especially the one about her just wanting to take care of him because he is her last remaining family member or maybe she just feels indebted to him for saving her life or both) but at this point it's becoming harder to deny. The thing is about this show though is it's made love stuff a bit clearer for certain characters (like Ymir) but it hasn't really done anything explicit regarding other characters so we are stuck playing this game of behavior analysis."
attackontitan,31t99p,AdventurePee,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:59:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yea better not reveal the end for anyone here that hasn't finished lol. Yea there are some things that could be arguments on both sides, like how she's so protective."
attackontitan,31t99p,Joesus056,2,Wed Apr 8 11:17:16 2015 UTC,"I've only seen the anime, and I agree that Mikasa definitely loves Eren more than just family, but from what I've seen Eren is pretty determined to be able to change into a titan at will. In order to do that he has to let go of his humanity, like Lionhart did. He may care about her(the anime doesnt give us much on that), but if he wants to really destroy all the titans he'll have to put that aside for now."

Characters are dying left and right, which just makes it even more real for me. These people have been holed up behind their precious walls for 100 years. They are weak and unable to comprehend what is happening in the real world.   Your feels will be more hurt and confused than anything you will ever watch in your life in the next few episodes. This is truly such a great show and I cannot believe it took me this long to check it out."

attackontitan,31m5s7,SaulidSnake,2,Mon Apr 6 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"The fact that it's an entire medium of entertainment that shares nearly identical tropes and styles. Also the fans, a while ago before I held that view I was watching Spirited Away and some asshat went blue in the mouth for twenty minutes about how the English dubbed version was trash and how we should be watching it with original audio and subtitles."
attackontitan,31m5s7,SaulidSnake,2,Mon Apr 6 18:26:27 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah both are fair points, but outside of shows like Cowboy Bebop which had great dubbing, it's pretty terrible voice acting most of the time. Glad you're enjoying it!"

attackontitan,31gjxi,sumrexnox,6,Sun Apr 5 03:19:31 2015 UTC,"No because they were using that as an excuse to lure out the mole.  Which was, spoiler: annie. After the death of the two titans erwin wanted to know who did it. Sadly as much as I want to see the basement I feel like it solves every mystery about the series. Like what makes people titans."
attackontitan,31gjxi,mmatt199,3,Sun Apr 5 03:57:11 2015 UTC,So here's a map that kind of explains it:  http://i.imgur.com/5p6giFl.jpg
attackontitan,31gjxi,ashliyo,2,Sun Apr 5 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"So since there is 100km between the walls, there is room for both populated regions and more rural areas. I was imagining the space between the walls as much smaller, so I thought their mission that ended up with them going to the forest had nothing to do with the basement. Thanks!"
attackontitan,31gjxi,ashliyo,2,Sun Apr 5 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"Np! :)   I tried to add a little explanation as well, but I can't figure out the spoiler tag thing so I didn't post it"
attackontitan,31gjxi,ashliyo,2,Sun Apr 5 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"I think you did the spoiler thing correctly before, I just didn't look at it because I don't want any manga spoilers yet :)"
attackontitan,31gjxi,Crowlad,2,Mon Apr 6 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Also, when I first watched the anime, the geography confused me like crazy. Especially in the first episode where Eren and Mikasa are out in the grass and then they walk through a gate to talk to Hannes. I was like, ""BUT THEY WERE ALREADY OUTSIDE!! I DON'T UNDERSTAND!"" but then later I realized they weren't outside the walls. Then things started making sense. Still kinda confusing though."
attackontitan,31gjxi,superpencil121,3,Sun Apr 5 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"I just rewatched the first episode today, and I understood a lot more. I similarly though they were outside of the walls in that scene until I rewatched. The map posted above was also shown, and it all made sense."
attackontitan,31gjxi,KillZacular,2,Mon Apr 6 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read somewhere that if you calculate the space within all the walls, it's like twice as big as germany."
attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,2,Thu Apr 9 04:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is they would have send a bunch of highly trained people, and a lot of them or all of them could die. They're not willing to waste good soldiers when so many have already died."
attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,2,Sun Apr 5 02:38:20 2015 UTC,So I guess this is where I'm not understanding how big the area between the outer walls is or how densely occupied it is by titans. Are titans still constantly hanging out there in large numbers? Why would it be any bigger a mission than retaking Trost?
attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,4,Sun Apr 5 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"Have only seen the anime, but I would imagine it's due to numbers. Trost was only open for moments and a huge number of titans flew in and with that, a large number of deaths. Since they would have to get through two more sections of the wall that have had titans flooding in non-stop since their opening, it would be near impossible. Instead I would think they would inch their way in slowly or by sections instead of trying to sneak or power through."

attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,2,Sun Apr 5 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Could you be more specific? They went all the way out to the forest for that expedition, and the point was to find the person who killed the captured titans - right?"
attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,2,Sun Apr 5 14:15:13 2015 UTC,The expedition was to go to Eren's basement.
attackontitan,31gjxi,dankry,2,Sun Apr 5 15:21:30 2015 UTC,"How did they end up all the way out into that forest then? That's not all within Wall Maria is it? They also abandoned the mission when they didn't capture the female Titan, with no mention of the basement, so I didn't pick that up if it was the case."

attackontitan,315vxj,Kunichi,6,Fri Jun 5 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"Apart from the manga needing to progress a bit...the production values for season 1 were crazy. The animation quality was top notch, the music was excellent, and the atmospheric tweaks (coloring, particles) also were part of it. I say let them take their time. I'd hate to have a rushed product which isn't true to the source material."
attackontitan,315vxj,TheBrandwich,2,Fri Apr 3 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Lack of source material.  Also, if you're interested, the people who make the series don't come up with the opening tracks."
attackontitan,315vxj,Zaeh,2,Thu Apr 2 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"As others have said, lack of source material. They're working with what they have now, and should have enough to almost have a season's worth of content. Things that take a long time tend to be good, so at least know that the hella long wait will be more than worth it."
attackontitan,315vxj,TheFarquaadSquad,3,Fri Apr 3 00:00:36 2015 UTC,studio time & production constraints
attackontitan,315vxj,niizuma,6,Thu Apr 2 09:08:38 2015 UTC,Not at all. The only reason is the amount of source material.
attackontitan,315vxj,Zaeh,-1,Thu Apr 2 17:30:07 2015 UTC,theres already enough source material to make a 2nd season if i recall correctly the production of season 1 was plagued with production issues which lead to the addition of a recap episode midway through the season in order to allow the studio to meet their deadlines
attackontitan,315vxj,niizuma,3,Thu Apr 2 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"The first season was not plagued with production issues. Recap episodes are also done very often, and while the addition of one means having a 'free' week, it doesn't still mean that the studio is having issues or trouble hitting deadlines. Anime is also not produced episode by episode.  They've gotten enough material for a two-cour season only recently, which is a part of the reason production didn't start earlier. The other part is Wit thinking ahead for the third season and the source material needed for that. Making season 2 only now will balance the wait times between seasons, and not make it so that the wait between season 2 and 3 would've been ridiculously long (which would have been the case if they started production on season 2 way earlier). However, it is not a production issue - wasn't with season 1 and definitely isn't now with 2."

attackontitan,30m0gn,kr4nker,3,Sun Mar 29 09:35:57 2015 UTC,I've heard that so many times and I still have no clue why people think less fps is more cinematic. I personally think that the hobbit movies looked amazing in 48 fps and would love to see movies and anime go even higher.
attackontitan,30m0gn,ImperialDoor,-4,Sun Mar 29 09:58:58 2015 UTC,It doesn't look better. It looks like a film you see on YouTube by amateurs.  If it looked better then why aren't all movies made in high FPS?
attackontitan,30m0gn,kr4nker,2,Sun Mar 29 10:54:11 2015 UTC,"It's about the file size of the movies currently. I worked in a cinema a couple years back and I asked the same question to guy that had the responsibility to download and store the movies and also make sure the movies were ready. The hobbit in 3d at 48fps was 638GB is size, which is really hard to distribute and therefore is a pain in the ass for companies."

Humanity has set up its last ""sanctuary/home"" behind a city made of three rings of walls (think Ba Sing Se from Avatar: The Last Airbender).   The story begins when Titans break down the outer wall and attack the city. The protagonists Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are survive the attack and join the military to join humanity's effort to defeat the Titans. They soon learn that there's more to the Titans (and Eren) than meets the eye.   I won't go into it further because I'm on mobile and I'm not sure how to use spoiler tags.   Just a heads up, the story can get rather dark and the animation of the Titans has been a turn off for some people I know, but the story is very good.  The first season of the anime covers up to the late 20s in terms of anime chapters but I'm not sure exactly which volume it stops at. The anime is in the 60s I believe or is getting there so there's a lot to read/watch right now. Definitely worth getting into.  Edit: fixed a couple spelling errors. Damn auto correct."
attackontitan,2zq9o9,Alsenis,7,Fri Mar 20 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"really? people don't like the titan animations? Hadn't heard that, why?"
attackontitan,2zq9o9,crazymongrel,2,Mon Mar 23 16:55:33 2015 UTC,I'm just as confused. I saw nothing wrong with them
attackontitan,2zq9o9,RasenChidoriSS,4,Wed Mar 25 01:56:15 2015 UTC,Some of my roommates find them very creepy and disturbing looking so they dont watch the show with the rest of us.

attackontitan,2zq9o9,jumpforge,3,Thu Apr 9 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"I think (and this is one of my favorite points of the show) that the titans are so creepy because they appear so incredibly human at first. They look like average people with nice hair-cuts and very average facial features. Except they seem so incredibly souless. Its like one part of your brain says ""ok, just another person"" and the other says ""horrible monster"". If they were dragons or even giant disfigured humans, the titans wouldnt have nearly the effect that they have.   Very brilliant imo."
attackontitan,2zq9o9,mrdirkastan,6,Thu Apr 9 00:38:17 2015 UTC,I was just like you OP and I saw the first season subbed on Netflix. I loved it instantly so much so that I watched the dubbed version immediately after and caught up in the manga within a week.   This is one of my all time favorite anime series and the story is incredible.  OP I recommend experiencing it in all the glories that you can. It's worth it every time.

attackontitan,2zq9o9,RasenChidoriSS,7,Fri Mar 20 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"It's not episodic in that sense. It has a continuous overarching plot. The source material is a manga, but the anime adaptation is a very faithful one with a high budget."
attackontitan,2zq9o9,alne_the_silent,2,Fri Mar 20 22:22:16 2015 UTC,There is a manga to go along with it and I would highly recommend reading it

attackontitan,2zjzy5,altoid_lover,8,Thu Mar 19 14:15:10 2015 UTC,And the huge titan.. There is a bigger one. How are they going to scale that when this one already looks like it's in the upper atmosphere..
attackontitan,2zjzy5,hiphopapotamus1,5,Thu Mar 19 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not like American movies cast Caucaisans as Asian characters."
attackontitan,2zjzy5,Westcapade,2,Thu Mar 19 17:08:33 2015 UTC,Well they do get a ton of flak from anime fans due to that. Still disappointed Scarlett Johansson is going to play Motoko.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,Paclac,3,Thu Mar 19 20:34:06 2015 UTC,It might just have been a necessity. I really doubt that they would have been able to get any European or American companies to make the movie.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,SuperAlbertN7,2,Thu Mar 19 14:17:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that's very true. I guess you can't really expect the same level of detail in a movie.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,altoid_lover,6,Thu Mar 19 14:22:07 2015 UTC,It's of course a little sad. But as long as they don't fuck up as much as in the movie-that-shall-not-be-named it's probably going to be fine.

attackontitan,2zjzy5,Zoinggo,4,Thu Mar 19 07:02:28 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but when filing most shows, all cameras are rolling at all times. They just switch between what they want to show.

attackontitan,2zjzy5,zeronirvana,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:22:25 2015 UTC,It looks a lot more like Beijing or Hong Kong than medieval Germany. That's a little sad.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,SuperAlbertN7,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"Considering that the series doesn't take place in medieval Germany to begin with, not really. Although the live-action movie has the setting confirmed as a post-apocalyptic one, unlike the anime/manga, which has it left ambiguous."
attackontitan,2zjzy5,Zaeh,0,Fri Mar 20 22:26:42 2015 UTC,It's very clearly in medieval Germany. Just look at the architecture.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,SuperAlbertN7,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"It's far from medieval. Excluding some things like the 3D maneuver gear, if you'd have to compare the setting to a real life age, the 1700-1800s would easily be the closest match.  The setting takes inspiration from various sources, German architecture of the aforementioned time period possibly being one of them, but it is definitely not medieval. Neither is the series confirmed to be taking place in Germany, Europe nor even the real world. It's left ambiguous at this time."
attackontitan,2zjzy5,Zaeh,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:33:19 2015 UTC,I mean they talk about Asia so that's a pretty strong hint it's set in the real world.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,SuperAlbertN7,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"Mikasa is referenced as being the last oriental (in the context of ethnicity, not as being from a location). Real life races being in fictional works that are set in fictional worlds is nothing new, nor a confirmation for anything. There are also multiple hints towards pretty much all the alternatives, but like I said, nothing is confirmed and it's still all left ambiguous."
attackontitan,2zjzy5,Zaeh,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:42:43 2015 UTC,Don't they specifically mention Asia? I'm pretty sure they do although that could just have been a fuck up in the translation.
attackontitan,2zjzy5,SuperAlbertN7,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:47:14 2015 UTC,"It could have been translated like that due to the translator not knowing better (and it's a valid assumption), but in the Japanese it's just said in context of ethnicity."

And yes, the story picks up big time and I find it highly interesting now.   Without spoiling too much; no, they haven't gone to the basement yet, and at this point, it doesn't really look necessary anymore because certain things happen that would made you think what possibly the basement could have information on about the Royal family anymore and Erin's father... Unless it explains what's going on with the ""beast"" type Titan ;).   Also, yes it completely explains how the walls were made,  pretty interesting... The manga at the moment is at a huge cliff hanger for me.   It gets really deep really quick. I'm not sure what to think at the moment in the Manga, but I'm thinking Historia probably made the right decision (what could I be talking about!?.... Oh my...)"

She's a very special case character as you'll find it soon tonight I imagine. Levi, Mikasa, and a character named Kenny have something in common, and Mikasa actually has an additional component to her that makes her extra special.   I'm dying over here from suspense. Why can't he release the rest of the series right now all at once hehe :p"
attackontitan,2xgsov,niizuma,2,Sat Feb 28 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think so too. I've also seen how the number of chapters in one volume has almost doubled as more volumes have been released. I truly hope SnK finishes around 20 volumes because imo that's an optimum amount, and then studios can focus on making more complete anime and movies."

You lose the ability to look at how responses to questions are linked. For instance, you can't draw the conclusion that respondents who don't read the manga are more or less likely to watch a particular anime, or that those who haven't seen a particular anime are less likely to have watched AoT dubbed.   I don't think any of those conclusions are particularly meaningful, but the inner statistician in me cringes at the idea of surveys that consist entirely of individual straw polls."

attackontitan,2wp1yu,dark_salad,1 point,Mon Feb 23 14:08:11 2015 UTC,It's always a question because the second half of SAO was completely different than the first half. It completely removed the whole death aspect and transformed into a love story. A love story about two people who weren't even romantically involved until the last couple episodes of SAO.

But then I wanted to get into some good stuff and most dubs are just stupid sounding. Nowadays everything is subbed and easy to find plus it sounds much more natural in its native language. You get used to the reading.  It be different if English dubs sounded good but in all honesty they just feel out of place now. Soon you will understand my young padawan.

It's not even certain that the colossal titan can stand upright without the support of the wall. This is because of his proportions and size.

Also, another interesting little detail was the writing on the bottle: it had upside-down Japanese writing that translates into ""Armor - Braun"".  A little something to think about in the upcoming chapters."

I'm glad I did just because the anime changed and left out quite a few things (mostly small details and some character traits, but they did take a lot of liberty with the last two episodes...)

What I can tell you though is that is one of the top torrent downloads for anime and looks like it could be good.   I really enjoyed the Gurren Lagann but it is overthetop and not everyones style. (mechs) I really enjoyed the story though. If you want a good sci-fi movie expelled from paradise was pretty good.

attackontitan,2uie84,cloudydaydreamer,2,Tue Feb 3 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Tokyo Ghoul is about as gory as AoT and has a very nice premise. The problem is that they condensed roughly 80 chapters into 12 episodes, and did a Black Butler concerning season 2 (as in, it doesn't follow the manga AT ALL).  It's still pretty awesome, I'd just recommend reading the manga after you finish the anime, especially since you'll basically have two alternate universes. The manga also has a sequel called Tokyo Ghoul :re that is currently 15 chapters in."

attackontitan,2u6kc7,Pernapple,10,Fri Jan 30 09:13:38 2015 UTC,"They live inside a wall, I imagine they have limited resources; Salts incredibly valuable, there's not a lot of iron to go around, and there's not exactly a lot of educated people; bandits make a living giving black market military goods out in the open.  They may still use muskets because its only effective in human to human conflicts; Using shells may decrease reload time, but it's still an additional waste that gives no more effectiveness against titans.   The members of the Central Military Police's Anti-Human Suppression Squad are shown wearing a variant that is quite different from the standard 3D Maneuver Gear used by the regular forces. While the basic principles for maneuvering in it are the same, the design is drastically different with the bulk of the device worn over the shoulders rather than the hips, one tank of compressed air on the back rather than two mounted on the blade sheaths, and with the grapple-hooks being fired from the handgrips rather than from the blade sheaths. In addition, the swords are replaced with high powered pistols that are reloaded with the barrels being discarded and replaced with others stored in bandoliers worn over the thighs of the wielder.   It is safe to assume we have yet to see all reserved technologies, as the elite would be saved for the equipment that was the most resource intensive."

From what I've read, it's far better known in Japan (to be expected) although even a lot of my non anime and comics friends seem to know it, or at least of it. Certainly its fans bolster enough in numbers to justify the attraction.   I get what you're saying, but for an anime, it's hardly a niche one."

attackontitan,2t55lo,Koranondo,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:34:11 2015 UTC,I think Anne’s dad will be very important.   When she initially kicks Eren’s ass in training she states that her Father taught her how to fight. We then find out she is the Female Titan. Therefore I would argue her father is probably The Colossal Titan we see at the start of the series.
attackontitan,2t55lo,OctoFussy,0,Tue Feb 3 13:02:26 2015 UTC,I bet he's the general to the Army the guy that judged Erin while he was handcuffed by the looks of him.

Wearing something called the wings of freedom might have a tendency to feel liberating, you know? It's obviously something that they enjoy, it probably gives them confidence and makes them feel like a total fucking badass compared to any other day. You walk into class with your cloak and your jacket, sit down at your desk. Someone says shit to you? Well fuck them dude. You've gotta represent! If the titans attack, who's gonna be fucking ready? You are. Hell yeah you are.   But that's just my two cents."

Then, I took freezer paper (half is wax coated, the other is parchment paper) and traced the image onto the parchment side. I ironed on the stencil I made and cut out the pieces (lightest pieces first) and sprayed the jacket with bleach-water. I ironed the bleached areas to quicken the process of bleaching. I kept cutting off layers of the stencil, bleached, and ironed until I got the look I was going for! It took me from start to finish about 5 hours.  This is something that isn't extremely easy to replicate exactly. Every jacket would be slightly different, but I like that they have slight differences! Thanks for the encouraging words!"

attackontitan,2s36iv,ICutLikeABuffalo,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"Okay so to get the two different bleached tones, you just didn't spray as much bleach on the lighter parts, and then the whitest parts were just sprayed more or soaked in longer (or I suppose you could have two bleach solutions with one just more diluted than the other)?"
attackontitan,2s36iv,dark_salad,3,Sun Jan 11 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"You can have two different solutions and cover the individual parts, but what I did was a little complicated. I basically labeled on my stencil the lightest parts of the stencil and then the next lightest, and so forth. I cut the lightest parts of the stencil out first (this is all after I ironed the paper onto the jacket). It doesn't cut through the jacket if you are careful. I spray the first round by coating the entire area that is exposed with spray. I iron to dry. Then, I remove the next layer. Spray. Iron. The parts I exposed first are getting more bleach each round so they are getting lighter each round. The final layer didn't get any spray and the round before it got just a little. Does this make sense? Kinda? Haha!"

attackontitan,2s4v8q,Zaeh,1 point,Wed Jan 14 12:28:21 2015 UTC,"I've always thought anime was cool. Like most teenagers growing up I watched Dragon Ball Z and the like but wasn't an all out anime fan. Growing up I started to find a lot of anime that I had access to were cliche. But if you dig around there are some good ones. But for a while there I gave up on anime with the exception of a few.  Like you I just stumbled on Chance. On Netflix, Attack on Titan. I was feeling adventurous at the time and gave it a random shot. I was pleasantly surprised. This anime cuts the crap and hurts the feels almost like a drop kick to the balls with the savageness of giant humanoid cannibalism. It's gritty and often times unmerciful.  If you want some other anime that's cool and gritty check out: Samurai Champloo - It's completely unconventional and is badass as it is witty  Claymore - It's the anime that is most like Attack on Titan that I can think of. It's gritty, and you feel just as hopeless for your characters as you do with Attack on Titan at times.  Cowboy Bebop - It's just awesome"
attackontitan,2s4v8q,Echo6xRiot,0,Tue Feb 3 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"You might want to check out Berserk, Claymore and possibly Knights of Sidonia (which is CGI, though, and might be off-putting despite being an exact thematic match for Titan).  The problem is, not many anime are like Attack on Titan. It's pretty unique in many ways."
attackontitan,2s1lfg,Candence_To_Arms,3,Sun Jan 11 07:39:59 2015 UTC,Anyone know where to get one?
attackontitan,2s3q88,ICutLikeABuffalo,0,Sun Jan 11 22:44:26 2015 UTC,"Just make your friend catch up on the manga. That's the easiest and fastest solution, he'll also most likely understand the story best that way."
attackontitan,2s3q88,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would definitely be easiest but I don't know about fastest, just because he's really a busy guy and with each chapter being almost 50 pages, that might take him a while. As I was trying to summarize I kept remembering new things and getting sidetracked. I guess I'm not the best storyteller so I'm hoping someone can just help me organize these thoughts."
attackontitan,2s3q88,Zaeh,0,Mon Jan 12 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"Reading a chapter of the manga takes you about 5 minutes (max 10 if you're a really slow reader), and he has a month to spend that 5 minutes reading a chapter. He might be a busy guy, but I'm seriously concerned for his health if he doesn't have at least 10 minutes a month for his own interests and hobbies. That would seem pretty ridiculous."
attackontitan,2s3q88,Zaeh,0,Mon Jan 12 11:16:49 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your input but I already told him to ""just read the manga"" to get the best understanding of the story. That's why I posted this. I was seeing if anyone could help summarize; I wasn't looking for an analysis of my friend's health or expecting criticism for asking for help. But it looks like no one else is answering so it's not a big deal, I'll do the best job I can on my own again since it doesn't look like anyone is able or willing to help with the question I was asking.

attackontitan,2rkhpj,josh42042,1 point,Wed Jan 7 00:10:47 2015 UTC,Crunchyroll shows every episode in order. I believe that episode 13.5 is simply recap and can be skipped.
attackontitan,2rkhpj,Zeon1234567,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:07:31 2015 UTC,the episodes with stuff like .5 in them are either OVA's or a recap episode. 13.5 is a recap episode and can be skipped. The others are OVA's.Only the 1st one (the one about Ilse) is relevant to the story and confirmed canon.The second one is kinda a parody. The 3rd one is a side story that didn't happen in the manga. The 4th with Levi is based off of a spin-off manga which may or may not be canon.
attackontitan,2rkhpj,shotindaface,1 point,Wed Jan 7 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"For the sake of simplicity, just watch the episodes in the order they were released. The actual series first, episodes 1 to 25, and then the OVAs in order, 1, 2, 3 and so on. While the OVAs jump a bit in the chronology, they're still separate stories and can be watched by themselves."

attackontitan,2qsgfo,ShinyCharlizard,3,Tue Dec 30 15:08:33 2014 UTC,"I have, and it's of pretty decent quality for how inexpensive it is. The decal isn't the greatest, and the buttons are sewn on weird, but it's still pretty good, and works for cons and costumes."

I could have missed it though.  If you do start reading the manga, it doesn't come up until the last couple of chapters that are out right now. also, i regret reading the manga only because it's not finished and now i'm waiting for the next volume to be released. This is the first time I've ever looked forward to a manga coming out and frankly it scares me.  I wouldn't expect it to be explained in the anime until the end of season 2"

AoT anime doesn't have too much filler, parts that aren't in the manga, but there are slight differences here and there.

If they'd recognisably played with the main motifs, I might have enjoyed it more, but it was more like sitting through a Michael Bay 'Transformers' movie; cool visuals accompanied by loud, vaguely relevant noise.

attackontitan,2pufps,Derek_Mend,0,Sat Dec 20 01:32:04 2014 UTC,"Remember those purple flowers? For some reason when he stepped on the ground at this point, those flowers popped up from under his foot. I wanna guess the flowers have something to do with his titan powers but no one knows for sure at this point in the manga. Unless I missed something?"
attackontitan,2pufps,iamtheblacksmith,3,Mon Dec 22 02:41:43 2014 UTC,"I was curious about this, too. like it was previously stated, I'm guessing this shot was rushed and never got textured."
attackontitan,2pufps,shotindaface,2,Mon Dec 22 03:00:32 2014 UTC,Yea. It was just rushed. It's corrected in the dub and blu ray versions if I remember right.

attackontitan,2pmxv2,Ireadonthepooper,3,Thu Dec 18 01:24:44 2014 UTC,"Aizoban. Free, no ads that I've seen so far, fast. You'll need to download the entire chapters to read it and you need to search the Japanese name which is Shingeki no Kyojin. It's 64 chapters long.  To download it, find the magna, Tap the first result (the others are spin offs), Tap the menu icon in the upper right corner, download, and in the box that'll come up hit toggle all then queue. Because of the way it handles downloads I'd connect to your Wi-Fi if you don't have unlimited data and let it download overnight, because it downloads 64, 63, 62... until it finishes. Go to download queue to view its progress.  When it's done head over to downloaded magna, tap Shingeki no Kyojin, head to section one then knock yourself out."

attackontitan,2pmxv2,Xethaios,1 point,Sun Dec 21 19:17:35 2014 UTC,"Also, in case you didn't binge read it all one night like I did, the last 4 or so chapters have duplicate pages which makes them seem a lot longer than they are. It can be confusing, so red it if you haven't seen the page before and scroll past if you have. The only differences are the sytlization of the art (if that's the right word, some are inked and some not), phrasing and word choice. None of the alternate pages alter the story at all."

attackontitan,2pibgk,hamzahazam,2,Tue Dec 16 21:24:28 2014 UTC,I don't understand what you're asking
attackontitan,2pibgk,superpencil121,2,Tue Dec 16 21:37:58 2014 UTC,It wouldn't have the same appeal if they didn't show the blood and the death. It's most of the appeal. You can't have a show about man eating monsters without showing men getting eaten.
attackontitan,2pibgk,superpencil121,2,Tue Dec 16 23:01:28 2014 UTC,I think it's an effort to be realistic. People swear in real life. Also how could giant unintelligent monsters make clothing. They don't even have genitles so I don't see the problem.
attackontitan,2pibgk,superpencil121,2,Tue Dec 16 23:45:23 2014 UTC,"The more mature/seinen an anime/manga becomes, usually the more realistic become. You speak of language and the creepy personalities of some characters, that's what real people are like. I think it's actually easier to relate to characters in AoT when such mature content is shown openly, makes for a better and more entertaining show, that is if you are into darker anime. I feel you asking ""why"" is sort of a meaningless question, why is anything the way it is? Why isn't One Piece more mature, why isn't Hunter x Hunter more child friendly. Just how it is and how the story is told. I feel it's effective and tells the story well, it wouldn't be the same if it was overly censored. Plus, AoT isn't really THAT mature, it has quite a bit of humor for how it is now."
attackontitan,2pibgk,Chamaeleontis,3,Wed Dec 17 00:00:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah, well like I said, it wouldn't really be the same. I have other outlets for friendlier anime. AoT has its own identity, and in my opinion, it works."
attackontitan,2pibgk,Chamaeleontis,0,Wed Dec 17 01:50:03 2014 UTC,youre not going to like whats to come in season 2 because the show goes darker ie: torture scenes  murders gun battles people have their entire faces blown off etc   if you take issue with the content in the series then i suggest you consider reading something which you feel appeals more to your sensibilities may i suggest naruto one piece
attackontitan,2pibgk,niizuma,0,Wed Dec 17 03:04:31 2014 UTC,"Its not the gore and all that, in fact I like that, its just the innapropiate content such as naked titans, and language"
attackontitan,2pibgk,ad1217,2,Wed Dec 17 03:45:24 2014 UTC,"What about it do you think is inappropriate? There are a lot of different types of animated shows (as in any media), aimed towards diffrent audiences.  Also, to be somewhat pedantic, cartoons tend to refer to western animation, while anime is used for asian (mostly Japaneese) animation."

Also, what /u/Canadianlumber said is incorrect. The next chapter will come out in January, in the ""February issue"" of the magazine it's released in.

attackontitan,2p1sbr,kunuch,2,Fri Dec 12 14:23:01 2014 UTC,I would switch Eren and Mikasa. Eren is the one with the powers.
