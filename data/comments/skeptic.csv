skeptic,3e2nki,RichardFordBurley,12,Tue Jul 21 14:15:21 2015 UTC,Anti-GMO is probably the most widespread and biggest anti-scientific problem here in Norway. Many intelligent people who don't buy into any alternative or anti-scientific fads still buy into this anti-GMO woo.

skeptic,3e2nki,dort,4,Tue Jul 21 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"Anti-GMO is probably the most widespread and biggest anti-scientific problem here in Norway.   True. I even encountered this at the University of Oslo when I studied there. I took this course some years ago, and the lecturer, a well known paleo-diet freak, claimed it was impossible to do unbiased research regarding GMOs, as ""the food industry"" controlled all research facilities. He also praised earthing/grounding."

skeptic,3e2nki,SylvanKnight,4,Tue Jul 21 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"Question:  What amount of evidence is necessary before the precautionary principal doesn't apply?  I've seen that argument numerous times and never had the advocate actually explain what would be considered adequate. It's proving a negative (or reverse unfalsifiability), and every bit as unscientific of an expectation."
skeptic,3e2nki,UmmahSultan,4,Tue Jul 21 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"If by the precautionary principle you mean the idea that we consider everything ""unsafe"" until it's proven ""safe,"" I'd say the precautionary principle ought never to apply. But let me clarify what I mean by that.   The problem with the precautionary principle isn't that it's cautious -- caution makes sense when it comes to any public policy, regarding new technologies and old. The problem with the precautionary principle is it asks for the impossible, proof of absent harm, when all we can provide is absent proof of harm. It's an insurmountable obstacle.  Trying to determine how much caution to apply in the creation of public policy should, I think, be based upon the evidence. That might mean that when a brand new product comes out, you want to test it rigorously for safety in a number of areas -- or you might require it to be tested for safety in a number of areas by the company that wants you to allow their product (since they're the ones who'll profit). That's what, say, the FDA does for drugs in the US. An organization sets up regulatory hurdles designed to keep the populous safe -- but ones that are at least possible to achieve.   My favourite term, taken from the US civil system, is a ""preponderance of evidence."" For a civil case to be won, the majority of the evidence must point in one direction. Now, in science we have the idea of scientific consensus which I think is even more stringent. But either could be used as a good measure for public policy regarding GMOs. Rather than saying GMOs are banned until proven safe, it would be wisest to say GMOs are allowed, on a case by case basis, as approved by a regulatory agency which employs scientists within the appropriate fields to examine the evidence and make a call on the safety of a given thing. That would be the conservative way to do it, at least. If they say, ""you know, there isn't enough evidence here to rule out these specific concerns,"" then the company has to go back and produce science to address those concerns.   This is all to say that you can have caution without the precautionary principle."

And his disagreement has some basis in the truth.  CO2 is one of the more minor greenhouse gasses in terms of heat capacity.  Water (Vapor) is by far the gas with the greatest heat capacity.  However the period of time in which water vapor is in the atmosphere is very small in comparison to CO2. What he doesn't seem to understand is that they interact, and that CO2 appears to be the atmospheric content which has changed the most since the inception of the industrial revolution.  CO2 does trap heat, just not as well as water.  Still with growing concentrations, even if it doesn't have the greatest heat capacity of the greenhouse gases, there is enough of it trapping enough heat to be a driver of global warming.  You might also suggest that he cite actual climate scientists rather than physics bloggers who appear to no longer be professional scientists in any field."

His page on the preventative medical centre of Marin. What I find raises a red flag is this:   Ernie has more than 30 years experience in cell biology, biochemistry, genetics and electro-biology. He received his BSc. in Biochemistry/Genetics at Oregon State University in 1978, and he pursued Graduate Studies at the University of Minnesota in the fields of Molecular Biology and Developmental Genetics in 1979-1981   Yet, on the website, he is only listed as having his bachelors. He apparently tried to get his Masters, but didn't get it. Not sure what that says about him, so far this is only minor.  What's more though is that this man with a BSc apparently tried to understand the fundamentals elements of human aging, despite the fact that PhDs and post-doctoral fellows the world around are scrutinizing everything to do with aging in state-of-the-art labs. Not a red flag, but still somewhat suspicious.  What is more of a red flag (on the website above) is that     Hubbard had been working with the clinic’s doctors to explore a range of tests and treatments not often found in traditional doctor’s offices. These include “bio-impedence” analyzers that measure cellular energy and “chelating” formulas like ZNatural, which aim to stimulate the body to release toxins.    ""Traditional"" medicine. Red flag there.   ""Bio-impedence"" that measure cellular energy. Very misleading, what this actually does, is measure the resistance to electrical current in your body to determine your body fat percentage. You can read about it here.  “Chelating” formulas like ZNatural, which aim to stimulate the body to release toxins. Chelating agents are basically molecules that are made to bind to particular ions. In medical circles it is used to remove harmful metals from your body in cases of metal poisoning. The chelating agent will bind with the harmful metals, creating a single molecule that your body can safely handle and expel from your body.   Chelating treatments have been controversial—some doctors consider them ineffective and, in some cases, even dangerous.   Uh, no. Chelation therapy works very well at what it does, that is removing toxic metals from your body. It does (EDIT: practically) nothing else, and if you use it willy-nilly without understanding what it does, chelation therapy might very well remove all the calcium ions from your blood, and you may catch a serious case of death.  Chelation works, but using it to do (practically) anything other than removing toxic metals is kind of like using cyanide poisoning treatments to do anything else other than helping cure you from cyanide poisoning. The treatments are very dangerous, and are only used for cyanide poisoning, because while the treatment is dangerous, it is less dangerous than cyanide.   True enough, but the question is whether there has been a recent spike in these toxins, especially newcomers to the scene like thallium. Burden said she’d get back to me on that.   Bullshit. Thallium is not a newcomer ""toxin"" to the scene. It's what kills in rat poison, and it's been used for centuries. Thallium is rather toxic at high concentrations, but unless you work in a factory where thallium is being burned and you breathe the fumes, or unless you're handling/eating rat poison on a consistent basis, there's no real need to worry about it.  Bioaccumulation could be a problem, but that usually only works in marine food chains, because you eat the one large fish that ate hundreds of medium fish who all ate thousands of small fish, so that all the heavy metals the small fish ate will be found concentrated in the one big fish on your plate. Unless there's a severe amount of thallium around farms (like spraying rat poison on the fields themselves), kale won't be able to pick it up in nearly big enough quantity to cause problems, assuming that kale does actually pick up thallium."
skeptic,3e1ebi,BCRE8TVE,28,Tue Jul 21 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"Part 2   She admits, however, that at times she felt fatigued and foggy in the brain. But there was one other problem: She had always been admired for having beautiful hair, and now it was starting to fall out    Vague, hard-to-quantify symptoms that happen all the time in normal healthy people.   Seriously, if this guy is making links between thallium, kale, and the symptoms these people are having, I want to see his data. If he's not doing his scientific research the right way, we might see his study go the way of the water crystal study, where the researcher was actively picking and choosing which samples to use to get the results he wanted to see.  I have very serious doubts as to the ability of Mr Hubbard to conduct proper scientific research.  First of all, he works alongside people like this:    a man who promotes Western and Eastern Medicines, Nutrition and Detoxification, Herbology, and Mind/Body Healing (Elson M. Haas, MD), an acupuncturist and proponent of orthomolecular quackery (Michael E. Rosenbaum, M.D.), a man who received a doctorate in medicine from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, a second doctorate in Osteopathic Medicine, who uses techniques such as Cranial Sacral therapy, Myo-fascial release, Muscle Energy work, as well as Strain/Counterstrain and acupuncture therapy (Thomas H. Reece, DO, ND), a Licensed Acupuncturist and herborist, whose Chinese herbal formulas are individually modified, based on each patient's tongue/pulse diagnosis and symptoms, who believes that Acupuncture awakens the body's original intelligence to heal itself (Gigi Shames, L.Ac., NHD, CMT), a Certified Nutritionist, Herbalist, and Homeopath with a focus on detox therapy, who proscribes herbs to gently coax the body to heal itself ad to bring the body to its own natural of state of balance, and who studied 5-Element Theory and Ayurveda, (Janara Iman, CN) a Body Centered Therapist, with focus on Breathing and Emotional Release, who has a has a BS in Business and a Masters in Communications, and who has taught thousands how to use their innate body intelligence to create better health, prosperity and richer, more authentic relationships, to help individuals Boost their Mental And Physical Life Force using Transformative Breath Exercises, Movement, Guided Imagery, Emotional Release and Conscious Communication Protocols (Steve Sisgold, M.A.), a woman who has practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), energetic medicine, nutrition and herbology for more than 20 years, whose career has evolved over the past decade based on her intuitive gifts, with a background in energetic medicine, nutrition, herbology, acupuncture, and Medical Qigong (Carol Butterfield, Dpl., Ac).   Source, above emphasis mine. Given that his lab is in a kitchen, that he hasn't got his masters, and that he seems surrounded with the highest concentration of quackery, new-age bullshit, and traditional nonsense that I have ever seen, I somehow doubt that his scientific practices are terribly rigorous.    .7 parts per million (ppm), which is 7 times higher than what’s considered the “threshold” limit in the workplace.   EDIT fixed ppm/ppb error. According to the CDC, more than 5X10-6 grams, or five parts in a million billion, of thallium per L of urine is abnormal, but it isn't toxic until it hits 200X10-6 grams per litre, or 200 ppm ppb.   It's also good to notice that the CDC has listed the effects of thallium poisoning as: ""Long-term effects of thallium exposure can include difficulty walking, various involuntary movement disorders, and impairment of thought and mood. Neurological damage resolves slowly and may be permanent,""  and that these  symptoms are very different from what the article is stating.  As such, Mr. Ernie Hubbard either flat-out lying about the toxicity of thallium, or the journalist misunderstood and misrepresented what Mr. Hubbard said. Given the fact that there's a lot of money in it for Mr Hubbard if he can prove the necessity of chelation therapies like ZNatural, and the fact he's working in a den of quackery and new-age nonsense, I think the former is probably more likely.  My bad.   In one of the more widely studied instances of thallium contamination, at a cement plant in Germany decades ago, nearby residents suffered “a slight increase in nonspecific symptoms” when their urine showed thallium levels as low as .02 ppm.   Found the original study, who did report an increase in non-specific symptoms, but concluded that ""No positive correlation was found between the thallium levels in hair and urine and the prevalence of skin alterations, hair-loss and gastro-intestinal dysfunctions.""   If we remember that one ppmppb is one microgram per litre, the people in this study who lived around the cement plant has thallium urine levels of 2.6 micrograms/L up to 76.5 micrograms/L, or 2.6ppmppb to 76.5ppmppb. The two control groups (people not around and not affected by the cement plant) had thallium urine levels of 0.2 and 0.4 micrograms/L, or 0.2 and 0.4ppmppb. First off, the author of the article is wrong, because people showed non-specific symptoms at 2.6 to 76 ppm, not at 0.4ppm. Let's also remember the above quote from the article  TL;DR people near the German plant had no symptoms at 0.2 ppb, or 0.0002 ppm, and showed symptoms at 76 ppb, or 0.076 ppm. Apparently Mr Hubbard's patients have as high as 7 ppm of thallium, 100X times higher than people in Germany eating from fields on which thallium byproducts were almost practically raining. As I had said above, getting that much thallium is virtually impossible unless you spray rat poison on your fields, or that you have accidentally substituted salt for rat poison in your kitchen.  Other articles have however questioned the source of these numbers, since Mr Hubbard shopped around to find different labs that would give him the results he wanted, eventually settling on the Doctor Data laboratory near Chicago, who has a history of trying to sell people quack chelating treatments.  I had made a mistake in my calculations, 1 microgram per milliliter is one part in a million, but one microgram per litre is one part per billion.  The calculations in the article are correct, however it seems the numbers they get for urinary samples from their patients are fudged on purpose by poor practices.   Her thallium levels measured at .7 parts per million (ppm), which is 7 times higher than what’s considered the “threshold” limit in the workplace.   0.7 ppm is slightly above average, and nowhere near the threshold limit in the workplace. People in the study in Germany had thallium urine levels 100X higher, and only had minor side effects! People with thallium levels as low as 2.6 ppm did show more symptoms, but 2.6 is still 4X more thallium than Laura Fenamore's sample! There is no way at all to connect her symptoms with her thallium urine levels!  See above.   The thallium levels in Fenamore’s urine were 4,500 times higher than the CDC found in most Americans—at least when they last measured. That was in 2004, when the kale craze was just getting warmed up   This sounds more like fearmongering than anything else. This study published by the CDC explains exactly what they did when there was a suspected outbreak of thallium poisoning cases, and the steps they took."
skeptic,3e1ebi,BCRE8TVE,26,Tue Jul 21 13:45:36 2015 UTC,"Part 3   One might expect a person’s spouse to be biased, but her observations are credible for a few reasons. First, she didn’t completely buy Hubbard’s story, or his testing and detox procedures; and she does not like or eat cruciferous vegetables. Hubbard loved hearing that, because it handed him a convenient, mini-control on his study, suggesting that environmental factors may not have caused Fenamore’s toxicity. As coincidence would have it, two others in Hubbard’s study were twins, offering two people with the same genetic palate. “So I had a genetics control and an environmental control,” Hubbard says. “I had the kale haters and the kale lovers all getting their urine analyzed, and I think it’s hilarious.”   This is absolutely not how science works. I mean, this is Bill Nye backyard medical science. There's nothing wrong with doing chemistry experiments in your backyard, but when you purport to be a health expert, you are literally playing with people's lives, and your standards have to be massively higher than what we see here. If these are the 'controls' as Mr Hubbard puts it, I frankly don't know if he's even done any kind of statistical analysis at all!   By September of 2014, Hubbard was getting reports back showing heavy metals in virtually every kale sample he sent in. There were also traces of nickel, lead, cadmium, cesium, aluminum, and arsenic. Some of these metals are famously bad actors, or at least suspicious ones. For a touch of exploration, Hubbard also crunched a few jars of baby food. Lo and behold, they too contained heavy metals.   There is such a thing as a limit of detection. If the instruments you use to measure lead in a sample can detect as low as 1 ppm of lead, for example, then you can reliably tell when lead levels rise above that. However, if you can only detect a particle per million (ppm, or 0,000001) of lead, and your sample only has one particle per billion (ppb, or 0,000000001) of lead, your instruments will still read that there is 1 ppm of lead in your sample. Your instrument is in fact detecting 100X more lead in your sample than there really is, because your instrument simply isn't able to detect any lower than 1 ppm.  To say that there is heavy metals when you test samples means absolutely nothing unless we know how much there is, and what was the detection level of the instruments! It's just fearmongering at this point.   Hubbard is an experienced scientist (he is 65, and has been involved in several genetic engineering start-ups),   Bullshit. The man doesn't even have a masters degree, and lives in quacktown with homeopaths, naturopaths, acupuncturists, and qigong medicinal practitioners. If he had any scientific credibility to begin with, it went out the window when he went to the pmcm clinic. Everything he seems to be involved in on his linkedin profile is associated with new-age bullshit.   One kale sample reported thallium at 1.14 ppm, nickel at 20 ppm, and aluminum at 120 ppm. (As has been widely reported, aluminum is often suspected as a cause of both autism and Alzheimer’s disease.)   Bullshit. The only times these cases are made, are in poorly-made wannabe studies that try to link vaccine and autism.  Honestly, I've spent nearly an hour writing this, I don't have the heart to go through the rest and google every other line.  Bottom line is, this guy seems like a quack, he works with other quacks, he's been involved in quack for a long time, and while a lot of what is said in this article seems to be legitimate at first glance, anything more serious than a first glance will show you that there's more bullshit in this article than there is in your average dairy farm.  Just about EVERYTHING I googled was either misrepresented, blown out of proportion, wrong, misleading, or was deceptive in some form or another.  I had thought that my dream job was to do what Bill Nye did, but at this point I think I'm more inclined to use my bachelor's in biochemistry properly (unlike Mr Ernie Hubbard here) and debunk as much of this harmful hogwash as I can."

I doubt this guy has done any of that, so his results may not be accurate; but my point is, don't knock the houseboat kitchen lab...because that would be a pretty sweet lab IMO."

skeptic,3dxjws,genemachine,-7,Mon Jul 20 13:45:50 2015 UTC,"it must be a conspiracy for world domination   Schellnhuber;    Let me conclude this short contribution with a daydream about those key institutions that could bring about a sophisticated—and therefore more appropriate—version of the conventional “world government” notion..   Others quotes on the page raise the idea of suspending democracy.   Schellnhuber's seems to believe that science has proven that the earth can only support 1 billion people;   In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people   This sort of Malthusian delusion is what caused John Holdren - Obama's climate czar - to raise similar ideas  Here's Holdren;   Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society.    .   One way to carry out this disapproval might be to insist that all illegitimate babies be put up for adoption—especially those born to minors, who generally are not capable of caring properly for a child alone. If a single mother really wished to keep her baby, she might be obliged to go through adoption proceedings and demonstrate her ability to support and care for it. Adoption proceedings probably should remain more difficult for single people than for married couples, in recognition of the relative difficulty of raising children alone. It would even be possible to require pregnant single women to marry or have abortions, perhaps as an alternative to placement for adoption, depending on the society.    .   Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control. Indeed, this would pose some very difficult political, legal, and social questions, to say nothing of the technical problems. No such sterilant exists today, nor does one appear to be under development. To be acceptable, such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements: it must be uniformly effective, despite widely varying doses received by individuals, and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex, children, old people, pets, or livestock.    .   A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men. ... The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.    .   Perhaps those agencies, combined with UNEP and the United Nations population agencies, might eventually be developed into a Planetary Regime—sort of an international superagency for population, resources, and environment. Such a comprehensive Planetary Regime could control the development, administration, conservation, and distribution of all natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, at least insofar as international implications exist. Thus the Regime could have the power to control pollution not only in the atmosphere and oceans, but also in such freshwater bodies as rivers and lakes that cross international boundaries or that discharge into the oceans. The Regime might also be a logical central agency for regulating all international trade, perhaps including assistance from DCs to LDCs, and including all food on the international market.  The Planetary Regime might be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world and for each region and for arbitrating various countries' shares within their regional limits. Control of population size might remain the responsibility of each government, but the Regime would have some power to enforce the agreed limits.   It is not a ""conspiracy theory"" to quote what people actually said."

skeptic,3dva36,GhostCheese,4,Sun Jul 19 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"Just found this wonderful comment:   Homeopathy has an opposite logic as the one in traditionnal medicine based on chemistry. In chemistry, the more you have a component, the more effect it produces.  Homeopathy on the other hand, relies on principles now finally understood by quantum physics and wave lenghts that form this ""memory"" in the water solution it is diluted in.  BASICALLY : you're not giving your body something to make it better, you're telling your body through complex signals that there is something wrong and what it is, and then the body uses it's own varied set of defenses to cure itself.  So bottom line, homeopathy works and is usually much easier to use than traditionnal medicine because the lack of chemical components means less secondary effects, but CAN still cause bad effects if used wrongly (proof that it has an effect btw) and is NOT a replacement for eeeeverything in medicine, just a better alternative in some cases or a complimentary solution.  Hope this cleared the doubts of at least some people !

Because someone told him and instead of researching himself he believed that person which then established a confirmation bias with the subconscious fear of being humiliated for being wrong.   Hope this cleared doubts, although absolutely nothing was explained, proven, or even made any clearer.

Then I discuss epigenetics with other biologists and they seem to take epigenetics to be nearly any DNA-protein interaction.

I had a much easier childhood, and am basically the only one with immunity from my mom's wrath, but I've got a pretty unfulfilled adult life.  Sometimes I think that maybe those struggles helped shaped her into the well-adjusted successful person she is today.  She had the harder time growing up, but she's still well-loved, and I'm very proud of her (and my youngest sister too).  Anyhow, I don't know how your life turned out as an adult, but I guess what I'm saying is that maybe it's unfair to say the middle kid gets screwed, just because as a kid they had a bit more negative parental attention.

Until those criticisms are addressed IQ tests will be dismissed by many people and most sociologists.   Those criticisms have been addressed, cultural issues aren't really a factor in modern intelligence testing. Traditional tests like the WAIS are really only given to Western students who already have that history of test taking, and questions that might have cultural biases have been adjusted or removed as needed. For cultures who don't have that history other forms of intelligence tests have been devised, like Raven's Progressive Matrices (which has different designs to account for the practices and history of the culture being tested).   Anybody who dismisses IQ tests simply and plainly don't know what they're talking about. Like any other scientific tool it's not perfect, there are ranges of error, and room for improvement, but they are single-handedly the best tool we have for measuring intelligence. There is nothing that even comes close to the power it has, and that's why it practically has universal acceptance amongst all intelligence researchers."

Something less obvious, but IMO more probable, would be the field of the test.

That generally isn't a problem because those sorts of tasks are generally predicted by g factor and traditional IQ tests, and there are culture-specific designs that specifically measure different approaches to daily tasks that are viewed as ""intelligent"" by them so that we can relate their results to other cultures.   Something less obvious, but IMO more probable, would be the field of the test. Stereotypes (which a lot of the time are way-out of proportion versions of the truth), like that Asians are good at math, show that a great deal of Asians, deal more with math than the average Westerner.   That's true, certain demographics can be more or less comfortable with different areas but this isn't a major problem for two reasons:  1) we have other tests of intelligence that don't have any mathematical component and they all approximately line up anyway  2) IQ isn't a static measure that is supposed to not be affected by learning or history. If someone studies really hard at maths and gets better at it, and that reflects in their IQ score, then that's an accurate test of intelligence. We should expect intelligence to increase when people learn and get smarter."

As an example, I was listening to a presentation recently from a PhD candidate who did work with mental maps and Afghani immigrants. It was interesting work but she ran into the immediate problem of the women not being map-literate.

skeptic,3dqgx6,runewake2,0,Mon Jul 20 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"The context to the IQ finding is that it was once a dogma that firstborns had significantly higher IQ. Judith Rich Harris overturned this dogma by controlling for family size.  Some quotes from   http://judithrichharris.info/tna/birth-order/believe.htm   People from large families and people from small families differ, on average, in at least three measurable ways: socioeconomic status (SES), education, and IQ. Large families are more common at lower SES levels. On the average, mothers who have many children have less education and lower IQs than mothers of the same age with fewer children. On the average, children who have many siblings have lower IQs than children with few or no siblings, and they are less likely to graduate from high school (Blake, 1989; Ernst & Angst, 1983, Rodgers et al., 2000).  Of a sibship of two (sibship size is the number of offspring in a family), half are firstborns. Of a sibship of four, only a quarter are firstborns. Small families produce a relatively larger proportion of firstborns; large families produce more laterborns. A firstborn plucked at random from the population is more likely to be from a small family, a laterborn more likely to be from a large one.  Taken together, the facts in the previous two paragraphs imply the following: a firstborn is more likely than a laterborn to come from a higher SES family, to be born to and reared by intelligent parents, to have a higher IQ, and to be better educated.  Any study that fails to take family size and/or SES into account, and simply lumps together subjects from large and small sibships, is likely to find differences between firstborns and laterborns. But these differences are misleading: they are due to the fact that, on average, the firstborns come from higher SES homes and have higher IQs than the laterborns.  The best way to control for the effects of family size is to do the birth order comparisons separately for each sibship size: compare firstborns from sibships of two with laterborns from sibships of two, firstborns from sibships of three with laterborns from sibships of three, and so on. To do this properly requires collecting data from a large number of subjects -- hundreds or, better still, thousands. Small samples don't contain an adequate number of subjects from each sibship size."

The definition between ""conference"" and ""paper"" gets a little fuzzy across some disciplines; in some fields the conference-paper is the most important thing to establish your research, while in others (like mine) conferences are for unpublished, often unfinished work, and journal publication is key.  I don't know how people in Zharkova's field prioritize.    Zharkova comes off like a ""the Sun drives everything"" style climate denier, but even his interpretation of his results is more conservative than the media's ""here comes a mini ice age!""  That interpretation appears to be a fabrication that is mostly the fault of the media.    This has happened before - a cooling trend in the 70s and some serious discussion about reflection of solar radiation from sulfur aerosols was parlayed into 'here comes a mini ice age!' by the media at the time.  Climate deniers still throw parades for the Time Magazine covers about it and shriek about scientists predicting an ice age in the 70s.

DNews could have simply pointed out that the research is not published and left it at that, but it is more compelling to say ""and there's good reason to think it is wrong as well.""

I think I would agree with you that they aren't a reliable source, not because they've been incorrect, every science communicator is likely going to make mistakes. But for me, what makes a science communicator reliable is that they acknowledge their mistakes, let their audience know, and do so within a reasonable time frame.

I'm not interested in science content where they're either too lazy or incompetent to research the actual science on the subject (that being the whole purpose I'm watching the show) or are ignoring it to push an agenda.  It appears that one of two things happened:   Hank just googled GMOs and read whatever came up.  They all cited a paper, it seemed legit so he didn't read or analyze the paper, they all seemed to be saying the same things so they must be right.  That's it, research done, fire up the cameras and let's make the show.  That's lazy.  That's really lazy.  That's ""I failed my research report because I googled instead of finding real sources"" lazy.  In this case it's doubly damning because the information you get when you google GMOs can be blatantly and intentionally wrong. Hank already knew what he wanted to say from the start.  He wanted to present a viewpoint instead of telling us what the current research says.  He either intentionally didn't research the actual science or did, found it conflicted with his views and then discarded it.  This is treasonous.  If discarded current research for preconceived notions he couldn't back up with anything it's unforgivable (or maybe not, but he never acknowledged it or apologized, so we'll never know).

Even then they're not without their own biases, but I think that they tend to make it clear what their biases are and the fact that there are other academics who disagree with them.  I didn't see the old SciShow GMO video, though saw quite a bit of it as it was presented in one of Miles' videos, but I got the impression that they didn't even consider in the slightest that there were people who disagreed with the view they used to have on GMOs, and if they had considered that and looked into it then maybe they'd not have produced their awful original video...

The paper faced immediate criticism for all the reasons outlined in Myles' videos (among them, the lack of any statistically significant conclusions) as well as the way the paper was announced.  Hank either didn't bother looking for this, didn't analyze the paper himself, or knew it was a bad paper and because it agreed with his viewpoints he didn't care.  The second sentence there is even more worrying.  And again he's worded it in a very weaselly as if to say ""we weren't up front about our preconceptions but a bit of that bias seeped in.""  No, all the bias seeped in.  This is not an admission, nor is it an apology (they did pop ""We're sorry :("" up on the screen for about 2 seconds, I guess that counts...  technically).

skeptic,3dmbrm,rooktakesqueen,8,Fri Jul 17 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that link!  I would say it supports the idea that demineralized water, as an exclusive source of hydration, is less than ideal:   Demineralised water that has not been remineralized, or low-mineral content water – in the light of the absence or substantial lack of essential minerals in it – is not considered ideal drinking water, and therefore, its regular consumption may not be providing adequate levels of some beneficial nutrients.   But I don't think it supports the notion that drinking distilled water is ""terrible for you""."
skeptic,3dmbrm,planx_constant,5,Fri Jul 17 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"There are acute effects as well:   It has been adequately demonstrated that consuming water of low mineral content has a negative effect on homeostasis mechanisms, compromising the mineral and water metabolism in the body. An increase in urine output (i.e., increased diuresis) is associated with an increase in excretion of major intra- and extracellular ions from the body fluids, their negative balance, and changes in body water levels and functional activity of some body water management-dependent hormones.Experiments in animals, primarily rats, for up to one-year periods have repeatedly shown that the intake of distilled water or water with TDS ≤ 75 mg/L leads to: 1.) increased water intake, diuresis, extracellular fluid volume, and serum concentrations of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions and their increased elimination from the body, resulting in an overall negative balance.., and 2.) lower volumes of red cells and some other hematocrit changes (3). Although Rakhmanin et al. (6) did not find mutagenic or gonadotoxic effects of distilled water, they did report decreased secretion of tri-iodothyronine and aldosterone, increased secretion of cortisol, morphological changes in the kidneys including a more pronounced atrophy of glomeruli, and swollen vascular endothelium limiting the blood flow. Reduced skeletal ossification was also found in rat foetuses whose dams were given distilled water in a one-year study. Apparently the reduced mineral intake from water was not compensated by their diets, even if the animals were kept on standardized diet that was physiologically adequate in caloric value, nutrients and salt composition.  Results of experiments in human volunteers evaluated by researchers for the WHO report (3) are in agreement with those in animal experiments and suggest the basic mechanism of the effects of water low in TDS (e.g. < 100 mg/L) on water and mineral homeostasis. Low-mineral water markedly: 1.) increased diuresis (almost by 20%, on average), body water volume, and serum sodium concentrations, 2.) decreased serum potassium concentration, and 3.) increased the elimination of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and magnesium ions from the body. It was thought that low-mineral water acts on osmoreceptors of the gastrointestinal tract, causing an increased flow of sodium ions into the intestinal lumen and slight reduction in osmotic pressure in the portal venous system with subsequent enhanced release of sodium into the blood as an adaptation response. This osmotic change in the blood plasma results in the redistribution of body water; that is, there is an increase in the total extracellular fluid volume and the transfer of water from erythrocytes and interstitial fluid into the plasma and between intracellular and interstitial fluids. In response to the changed plasma volume, baroreceptors and volume receptors in the bloodstream are activated, inducing a decrease in aldosterone release and thus an increase in sodium elimination. Reactivity of the volume receptors in the vessels may result in a decrease in ADH release and an enhanced diuresis. The German Society for Nutrition reached similar conclusions about the effects of distilled water and warned the public against drinking it (7)."

Putting cells into distilled water causes water to rush into the cells due to the increased concentration  of salute in the cell compared to distilled water.  This causes the cells to swell and eventually burst.  It is a phenomena known as cytolysis.   The reverse of this phenomena is why high concentrations of salt or sugar in foods acts as preservative.

skeptic,3dmbrm,outspokenskeptic,14,Fri Jul 17 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"More interesting than the article, which I believe is quite poor. Here is the abstract:   Abstract   This  report  seeks  to  contribute  to  the  operationalization  of  the  concepts  of  “sustainable  development”,  “societal  benefits”  and  “ethical  justifiability”  of  the  Norwegian  Gene  Technology  Act.  In  order  to  achieve  this,  the  report  addresses  the  questions  surrounding  the  sustainability  of  herbicide-­‐tolerant  crops  identified  by  the  Norwegian  Biotechnology  Advisory  Board.  The  report  uses  the  case  of  Intacta TM  Roundup  Ready TM  2Pro—a  genetically  modified  stacked  crop–used  in  Brazilian  agriculture.  This  report  summarizes,  consolidates  and  contrasts  the  information  provided  by  the  dossier  on  the  environmental  and  food  biosafety  of  Intacta TM  Roundup  Ready TM  2Pro  submitted  by  the  applicant  to  the  Brazilian  authorities,  as  well  as  different  findings  reported  by  relevant  empirical  studies.  The  compiled  information  is  organized  in  two  sections.  The  first  part  addresses  ecological  aspects  of  the  genetically  modified  herbicide  tolerant  plant  and  its  related  herbicide  (glyphosate  and  related  commercial  formulations).  The  second  section  describes  social  and  economic  issues.  Of  particular  importance,  the  report  contrasts  the  applicant´s  conclusions  regarding  the  absence  of  adverse  effects  against  the  literature’s  findings  on  the  existence  of  an  array  of  possible  harmful  impacts.  Given  the  current  emphasis  on  types  of  production  systems,  the  set  of  indicators  used,  and  the  focus  on  specific  characteristics  of  herbicide  tolerant  crops,  it  can  be  recognized  that  the  current  state  of  knowledge  on  the  sustainability  of  herbicide  tolerant  crops  is  incomplete.    That being said the most important thing IMHO should be a focus on the long-term sustainability."

skeptic,3dpjwn,apatheticnihilist,4,Sat Jul 18 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"hi reddit.  Depends on what you mean by legit. In a social setting where you have some kind of therapist, you might get positive effects simply due to the fact that you are being cared for, but that applies to all sorts of unscientific forms of therapy. Then of course there is the placebo effect, which also contributes to any possible changes you might see. When used for entertainment, it's thought that the effects hypnosis seems to produce may actually be caused by a series of social variables, including the social expectation that you will act a certain way along with the circumstantial acceptance of behaviour that'd otherwise be seen as strange. So again, hypnosis works in some sense, but its effects are due to social factors rather than anything special about hypnosis as such. When used for some forms of psychotherapy however, hypnosis is just plain dangerous woo. There have been cases where fraudster therapists have (perhaps unintentionally so) tricked people into believing that all sorts of traumatic events happened to them, when in fact they never did. A lot of the satanic ritual abuse scares and dubious diagnosis of multiple personality disorder were created in this way, since people seem to be in a state of heightened suggestibility when hypnotised, which may again be due to social factors and expectations. So hypnosis definitely can do something, but its effects are probably not caused by what hypnotists say they are, and in some cases it's dangerous woo.
