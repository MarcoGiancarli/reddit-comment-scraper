AdiposeAmigos,3c20qd,TranceIsLove,5,Sun Jul 5 11:33:37 2015 UTC,"Since you seem OOTL, fph is now a banned subreddit. The decision was made about 3 weeks ago. When Pao took over, she swore to get rid of all harassing subreddits. I guess she felt that fph was one of those. /r/hamplanethatred was also banned, along with several others. FPH was the most controversial ban, because it was the only banned subreddit with 100,000 members. There were many fph clones created, but those were quickly reported and subsequently banned. The mods of fph were also shadowbanned. The banning of fph caused a mass exodus of many to go to Voat.   The banning of multiple subreddits, along with the firing of admin Victoria has caused the reddit community to go up in arms, and many said Reddit is going in the direction of becoming Digg.   In a lighter note, this is how the fatties felt among learning that fph is a banned subreddit."

In this group they will all find comfort and ""support"".  Of course we keep seeing the argument that fat shaming is wrong, but that is the only thing that pushes some individuals out of their comfort zone. You have to have some type of motivation to promote change. At some point the level of discomfort overpowers the desire to maintain the status quo.  Some people choose to take this energy and change their lifestyle and lose weight, these are the heroes. Some people choose to stay stagnant and make the situation change to fit their comfort level, ie: make fatness the accepted norm. These are the SJWs creating a niche on the internet defending obesity."

Most people who say illegal immigrants are destroying our country say so because they don't pay taxes and lower everyone's wages. I work in construction and know for a fact that due to immigrants willing to work for low wages my wages have to be cut so my company can stay competitive. I don't know anyone who disputes that many illegal immigrants are willing to do jobs no one else wants to do, but I don't agree with the popular narrative that ""Mexicans are harder workers than Americans"" because while they do work faster in a lot of cases, this causes their work to be sloppier than someone else doing the same job at a normal speed. Also, we have plenty of people who are here legally who pay taxes that need work, illegal immigration drives down wages and takes jobs away from others."

The obesity epidemic hasn't showed up until the prevalence of the sugary drinks and food. Maybe the tendency to over consume has always been there but it's just easier to do now, in combination with forms of entertainment that don't require physical activity.  I mean, I think there should be an approach involving both. Mandatory education in elementary - high school about healthy lifestyle habits and what it takes to not be fat, as well as some regulation on some of the worst food offenders like gallon-sized drinks.  Interestingly, I think we're already seeing a health trend in society, at least in more progressive, urban environments. 10 years ago it was all about ""supersize"" this and ""quadruple cheeseburger"" that. A few days ago, I just saw an ad for a ""mini"" drink at starbucks that was probably less than 8 oz. Not to mention to obsession with organic foods and things like Kale, etc. Not sure if this is here to stay, and perhaps I'm just attuned to a different part of American culture these days, but I think things could be changing slowly."

Women's clothes on the other hand are a fucking hodgepodge of numbers and sizes and whatnot that vary between designers, manufacturers, and styles... a size 6 one place could be a size 10 at another.

Wednesday, over 7 miles, at a casual pace gearing up in a farm for /r/Ingress, and if I hadn't been close to item capacity to begin with, it would have easily been 10 miles. Saturday, I won't be surprised if I surpass that (slowly) over the course of several hours. Since midnight, I've already walked half a mile. 4 is... nothing."

Also, men and women are built differently and body sizes cannot be accurately compared. Women are naturally thinner than men. But damn, a 36 on a woman and she acts like she's thin? I'm probably one of those people she'd call anorexic just for being in shape at nearly a foot smaller waist size. And I'm 6'2"" so I'm pretty sure height doesn't matter too much either"

AdiposeAmigos,36wg4o,Fit19yo,-1,Sat May 23 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"Not really.  If you only eat low nutrient density foods but in reasonable proportions you would become very malnourished and protein deficient and lose a huge proportion of your LBM as well as fat.  This leads to ""skinny fat"" where you may still have fat on your belly even if you're normal weight or even underweight.  (and remember, the premise here was not having stomach fat, not just being a normal sized person).  I agree that stop eating so fucking much is the overriding most important principle but I'm tired of how often I keep hearing just eat less, even if its cake.  Yeah, you'll lose weight.  Hell, you might even lose weight faster with all that muscle wasting you'll have going on but the results will be atrocious."
AdiposeAmigos,36wg4o,AndrewCarnage,0,Sat May 23 15:58:03 2015 UTC,Nope. If the macros and calories are the same it'll make next to no difference.  You can eat junk food and still have an amazing body. Will it be good for your health? Of course not. Will eating junk food in reasonable portions magically make you fat? Hell no.
AdiposeAmigos,36wg4o,Fit19yo,0,Sun May 24 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"If the macros and calories are the same...   The macros cannot be the same.  ""candy, soda, cake, pie, ice-cream"" have extremely low amounts of protein.  Just about the only healthy foods with lower protein values than the highest protein food in that list are fruit (ice cream at about 7% protein is the highest because of the milk.  And that's plain ice cream.  Start adding chocolate or candy or...).  Fruit, that's it.  And not even all fruits.  Most berries have more protein.  Virtually all grains and starches have at least 7% protein and often have quite a bit more.  Non-starcy vegetables usually have way more.  Lean meats and dairy products obviously have way way more etc etc...  If you just ate a completely random diet of healthy whole foods not even trying to optimize it you would pretty much automatically be getting more protein than the person trying to optimize their diet from that list by only eating ice cream and forgoing the candy, soda et. al.  Quick Edit:  Sorry, meant to address the fact that eating junk food in reasonable portion won't magically make you fat.  Of course, I agree.  Again, though, the premise of this post was about someone going from having a flabby gut to a fat free one.  If their abs are shrinking faster than their gut they're probably still gonna have a flabby gut when they get down to normal weight."

A bit of restriction, a year later the purging started. Completely unmanageable body dysmorphia and self-loathing. (Didn't help at all to avoid obesity, though, but I'm on my way back down now.)  I was also hot as fuck -- but at 12, I thought that having those tits, etc. made me ""fat,"" while the pre-pubescant girls in my class were ""correct."" (Let me clarify: at 12, of course I was not legally ""hot."" But the men in their 20s didn't stop talking to me when they found out I really was that young. I'm an advocate for a new system of dealing with childhood sexuality. It's not like there's a perfect answer, and I definitely think an age of consent is helpful 99% of the time, but I was 12, I didn't look 12, and I didn't act 12. It was the law that stopped me from getting what I wanted -- what those men were not wrong for also wanting.)  I was friends, that year, with the ""popular girls,"" and we spent a lot of time in the bathroom. A while back, my mom had helped me bleach my hair so I could do semi-permanent blue, green, purple, etc. but those colors had worn out.  Me: ""mumble mumble... I need to dye it.""  Popular, beautiful, perfect, thin girl: ""What?! Oh my god, are you ok? You do not need to lose weight!""  ""...Well, okay, but my hair is currently the color of a sick tiger. So.""

AdiposeAmigos,2zjh0r,eXe_Diamond,3,Fri Mar 20 00:08:55 2015 UTC,"It was even more disgusting. Here's the original thread, and some more details:   Making a new account cause I don't want to get any heat for this. I know who bitch that is and I know what she was doing. Not gonna name names cause I don't want to reign r/Kappa hellfire upon them. She's a local anime player and not very bright (I'm pretty sure she has aspergers or something like that), she's a very much ""Social Justice Warrior"" like aswell. Anyway she was not happy with ShinBlade and the Memphis team at all and was pretty vocal to a few people about her not liking ShinBlade thinking he's a rude person and too loud for the tournament. So when ShinBlade starts popping off she decides to go up and grab him, trying to look like she's calming him down but mainly to bait a reaction out of him. Not only did she try to get him DQ'd but he wanted him to end up as another Aris CrossAssault situation and make it look like he attacked her and get some serious heat heading his way from shit like Kotaku and Polygon. I guess she's going off the logic that cause she's a girl people will believe her over the guy. She wasn't alone on this either, she told her friends, who are thirsty as fuck white knight nerds, this whole thing and they jumped in. Hence you can hear dudes in this video yelling to DQ him before anyone knew what was going on even though he did nothing wrong and she was the instigator. This seriously isn't the first time she's played the victim like this to get someone else in a fucked up situation either, on facebook right now she's making the whole situation revolve around her. Anyway TOs show up and try to figure out what the fuck happened ready to get the DQ hammer out, I didn't hear the conversation but I assume dudes with tapes and witnesses confirm that ShinBlade did nothing and the girl started it, tournament continues but I assume ShinBlade was told to keep the pop offs quiet. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation before Kotaku shows up and tries to make it look like ShinBlade assaulted a woman and how the FGC is mysoginst."

Both a half-gallon of Haggen-Daaz to the bottom.  Fill the olympic-sized pool only HALFWAY with water.  Lock Tess-Sun and 100 of her Hamplanet followers in said room with pool.  The trick is that the pool being halfway full will tempt the beasts as the prize is reachable; however, fatties will not allow other fatties to take such a prize and they definitely are not going to share.  So all 101 butter-blobs jump in at the same time, fighting each other for the delicious dairy treat.  Little do they realize that other objects in the pool displace water, making it rise slightly.  Make it a bigger object, such as a Tumblrina, and more water is displaced and the water rises higher.  Multiply that mass by 101 butter golems and it will overflow near the top of the intake.  Then take into account their lack of spatial awareness - 101 large masses side by side in the pool would wedge themselves in, unable to free themselves to get to the surface.  Blub, blub, whales cannot get air.  Whales become motionless masses.  They die happy.  We live happy.  And to think they accuse us of hating them.    Feel free to swipe and repost.

She tells me I can't just leave food out all day for them, because they'll eat and eat and eat.  I was sort of shocked because I hadn't thought about that and replied, ""Well, I guess I thought they would just eat a healthy amount of food and then think, 'well, I've consumed all the calories I need for the day, time to stop eating!'""

Also the thing about vintage sizing was just that they used different numbers, it basically started from 10 and then went up. Nowadays they want to appeal to our vanity so what they did was they based the size numbers off of your waistline - 20, for instance a 20 inch waist is a size 0, a 28 inch waist is a size 8, etc. The larger sizes began at 32.5 back then, just as they do now."

AdiposeAmigos,2qjew0,Malarazz,2,Mon Jan 5 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"It's really not though. Pudge doesn't really do much damage, and the hp is nice but he doesn't tank quite as well as other tankers. Pudge is at his best at the early and mid game when he's going around ganking.  A 15/0 Pudge will obviously be very hard to deal with, but that's because of the 15/0, not the Pudge. Whereas someone like Medusa is a real threat at level 25 even if she went 1/6."

I didn't before as clearly but I still don't think you should shrug it off. What if the CDC was shrugging it off? That's why I called it ignorant.

Baking takes work and effort, therefore lardos don't generally bake.  That's why they're always rolling through the bakery in the supermarket on those disabled carts.  ""Rolled"" in flour is what happens when someone is trying to find where to stick his dick, since it's not easy to find when hidden by rolls and a fupa.

People who say they eat anything they want but don't gain weight don't eat as much as you or they might think. Even if you and them eat together while on an outing doesn't mean they eat as much on their own, a lot of skinnier people may not find as much joy in food as others and so they only really eat when they go out with friends, otherwise they probably do eat very little."
AdiposeAmigos,2htjxn,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,2,Tue Oct 14 06:44:52 2014 UTC,"Exactly, not to mention even if they ARE a healthy person eating all the time, it's WHAT are they eating? If it's a handful of almonds now, a lite yogurt in 2 hours, a salad 2 hours after that with a light dressing and grilled chicken, it looks like they're constantly eating. instead you've now crossed 6 hours and only consumed 600-700 calories tops.

So how the hell was this dude skinny? Well he still works out a decent enough and I noticed that even though the rest of us would eat out while we were hanging out this guy never would, he'd come with us to a mcbeetus and say he'd want something but change his mind as soon as he got in line.

A lot of people don't pay attention to this fact and keep shoveling ""low fat"" foods down their throat thinking they're not going to gain a single pound. Food education and nutrition in the US is shit right now and compromised by mega-conglomerates trying to market sugary ass shit to kids.
