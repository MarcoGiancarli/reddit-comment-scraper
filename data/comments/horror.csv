horror,3dqcxe,Everyscene,47,Sat Jul 18 12:42:58 2015 UTC,"Horror/comedy is hard to get right. Too much horror and the comedy falls flat. Too much comedy an it ends up looking like a cartoon. I would say some classic horror/comedy's are Return of the Living Dead, Evil Dead 2, Shaun of the Dead, Arachnaphobia, Gremlins/Greamlins 2, Idle Hands, the first Scary Movie, Ghostbusters (of course) and Ghostbusters II, Fright Night,   Night of the Creeps, Monster Squad and Beetlejuice.   This is just a small list of some of my favorite horror/comedies. IMO the hallmark of a great horror/comedy is one that takes its characters seriously. No matter how goofy the concept the characters are believable because they have a lot of heart and feel like real people (like Shaun in Shaun) or are played 'straight' (Ash in Evil Dead 2, Burt and Freddy in Return of the Living dead) while reality around them becomes more and more twisted and absurd.   To be honest I think Return of the Living Dead would be a great intro to what a good horror/comedy is all about."
horror,3dqcxe,ziddersroofurry,35,Sat Jul 18 13:44:34 2015 UTC,Housebound is one to add to your list. Scary and very funny with some really tense moments.

horror,3dqcxe,chepalleee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:57:47 2015 UTC,Hm...I'll have to check this one out. The premise isn't one I'd normally be into though. Mockumentary style stuff where the subject is a killer tend to stretch my willing suspension but then again 'Things We Do In The Dark' rocked.
horror,3dqcxe,ziddersroofurry,0,Sat Jul 18 19:43:57 2015 UTC,This was a great movie until they ditched the mockumentary style.
horror,3dqcxe,RadRhino,2,Sat Jul 18 23:38:50 2015 UTC,I thought that that was part of the point.  The first two thirds of the film setting up the rules for the last half.  Like we didn't already know them.

horror,3dqcxe,liquidsolidussnake,8,Sat Jul 18 17:39:23 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know that I'd call that a horror comedy. It does get laughs but I think that's sheer from how uncomfortable you get with his nonchalance while doing these things and your mind has no other way to react.  Maybe that's exactly what a horror comedy should be though. I don't even know anymore.
horror,3dqcxe,Bradart,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:28:21 2015 UTC,I agree that it's a black comedy/horror/satire but at the same time I'm not a huge fan of the film so It's not one I would have thought of. Appreciate the suggestion though. Just 'cus I'm not a fan doesn't mean someone else won't be. :)

horror,3dqcxe,BackOfTheHearse,23,Sat Jul 18 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of the comedy of the first Evil Dead was unintentional, and a result of the low budget and guerrilla filmmaking style.  The 3 Stooges reference, of course, being one of the exceptions."
horror,3dqcxe,kinuman93,3,Sat Jul 18 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Tbh I find the low budget feeling helps the movie. When I saw this when I was a kid it terrified me. I couldn't finish it alone.

horror,3dqcxe,kinuman93,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:07 2015 UTC,It's filled with a lot more slap stick comedy. The hand also brings a few good laughs with it's taunting around the house.

Both have a ridiculous monster thing in the title. But sharkando was mostly just an attempt to copy and paste elements from ""so bad it's good movies"".  And it doesn't work. You can't intentionally create something like that. Zombeavers was just a straight out attempt to make a fun monster movie with comedic elements.   Personally I really liked zombeavers. Like it or not though, I think it's clear that effort went into it. They were trying to make the best movie they could with what they had.

The way I see it, this movie is just part of a very specific subset of horror comedies-- I think of them as ""comedies about horror"", because they revolve so much around playing with popular horror tropes. Tucker and Dale Versus Evil and You're Next subverts them while horror comedies like Leslie Vernon and Cabin in the Woods deconstruct them, and that's pretty much all they're about.   In contrast, there are films like The Frighteners, Beetlejuice, Suburban Gothic, and Life After Beth which don't have that same ""making fun of the horror genre in a really self aware way"" sort of thing going on.  Bottom line-- Tucker and Dale vs Evil is not representative of horror comedies in general, although ""let's take this horror trope and turn it on its head"" is a popular style of horror comedy currently."

It's a horror/comedy that takes place on a tropical resort island.  The gang has to contend with a serial killer on the island, and turn on each other trying to figure out who it could be.  Lots of awesome death scenes.  Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil.  Two happy-go-lucky rednecks in a cabin are encountered by a group of teenagers.  Hilarity ensues when a series of unfortunate accidents convinces the teenagers the rednecks are some Deliverance style psychos.  Braindead by Peter Jackson.  His 1st and 2nd films were low-budget horror movies set in NZ.  A virus turns the local populace into blood thirsty fast-zombies and only Peter can save the day."

horror,3dqcxe,BlooWhite,4,Sat Jul 18 14:09:19 2015 UTC,For me it was growing up watching ALL the super serious award winning AAA horror films. After a while you find it harder and harder to find the hard hitting films you remember from your youth. Couple that with the fact that horror isn't as viscerally terrifying as it once was and you have a recipe for forking your interests. Horror Comedies and cheesy horror films fit that bill perfectly.  Edit: calm down people.  I just meant films are not as terrifying today than as you remember them from childhood. Sure they can be scary but you are able to digest them with a rational adult mind..
horror,3dqcxe,ketchupvampire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:44:19 2015 UTC,How are films not as terrifying today? Many modern films are considered some of the scariest to watch.
horror,3dqcxe,ketchupvampire,3,Sat Jul 18 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"What do you consider terrifying? I like hearing people's top films. I think the only time I was truly scared was during The Blair Witch Project, I was in middle school though, and Marebito, granted I was incredibly stoned. Inland Empire made me really unsettled but scared would be a stretch. I feel like I've seen so many horror films I'm desensitized to being scared. For example, It Follows scared my husband but I just thought it was a good way to pass two hours. I'm worried I'll never be scared again  :("
horror,3dqcxe,boringoldcookie,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"What do you consider terrifying? Any films older than Blair Witch? If you've got a specific taste other than that I'm sure I've got some scares for you! :)  I thought It follows was pretty average. Okay concept but just not a scary movie. Would have been better without the teen drama.   Here's some movies I found scary, a mix of obscure-ish and well-known, in various subgenres and no particular order:    Sinister - A true crime writer moves into the house that the true crime he is writing about happened in. Strangely, his wife does not agree. He finds a box of super 8 movies in the attic that show not only the murder that happened in his house, but a string of other murders as well.  Grave Encounters - A 'ghost hunter' type show investigates an abandoned asylum. If the things that creep you out include getting lost, impossible geometry, surroundings changing, and a group of people waiting for sunrise realising they've been in that asylum for like a week and the sun has not risen yet, this is for you.  Yellowbrickroad - This one is probably closes to Blair Witch on this list. It's about a group of friends that investigate a trail in the woods and then can't find their way back. This ruined a genre of music for me and just left me feeling incredibly uneasy, similar to Blair Witch. Dark Skies - If you're into very well done alien encounters this is for you. It's a mock documentary that comes off as very real and has some really freaky segments.  The Descent - A group of friends go caving. The cave they're in doesn't match the cave they're supposed to be in and they soon find themselves trapped. Claustrophobia, wounded people, the dark, and something seems to be after them in this unexplored cave. Gets a bit hackyslashy towards the end but otherwise really good.  As Above So Below - A very recent one, around the same time as It Follows. An archaeologist/relichunter ventures into the catacombs of Paris looking for the philosopher's stone. Things get creepy. That is all."

I've seen Sinister, Grave Encounters and The Descent. I really enjoyed Sinister! I am claustrophobic so The Descent got me there but the bat things were cheesy to me. Grave Encounters was a miss for me but it wasn't bad. I will check out the other ones! Yellow brick Road sounds good! I really appreciate this. Asian horror usually creeps me out for awhile. The Audition left me unsettled and the original Ringu I enjoyed! So in a nutshell I love Asain lore horror and leaving less to the imagination. Again, I really appreciate you taking the time!"

I will check out As Above So Below too. Thanks again."

horror,3dqcxe,T0mServo,2,Sat Jul 18 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Didn't mean to give offense. Many horror movies these days are all about ""cheap thrills"" just like they were in the past. It's just that we're biased because obviously the things we saw when we were little would be scarier - we couldn't process them as well as we can today. Whether they are objectively more scary or less is hard to determine because of our bias. So I don't know if telling you some movies I thought are scary would matter."

horror,3dqcxe,Wireless-Wizard,4,Sat Jul 18 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that comedy and horror are opposite at all. It takes the exact same mechanisms to deliver a good joke as it does to deliver a good scare. Setup - delivery - punchline. The two go hand in hand in a lot of ways. If used correctly, comedy in a tense horror film can enhance the experience by taking you on a ride of emotions. Tension-scare-laughter."

The part I used to work in consisted of about 30 bungalows in a circle, Just off campus (they weren't that old, maybe 1950s or 60s built but had always belonged to the college) These bungalows were split into 3 sections, With each team having about 10 bungalows to look after. They were intended for students to progress to after learning to be more independent although that wasn't always the case.  The part I was working in had one big bungalow which was 2 knocked into 1 where we had some less able students living and also a member of staff sleeping in, who would look after them and the 8 or so other bungalows.  It was in the summer holidays so all the students had gone home but us staff still had to work a certain number of shifts (which we chose ourselves) to do things like cleaning and paper work, And I was working a saturday night alone, There were a few people about on campus but they were working elsewhere. All the work in that particular area had been done, We all had a bungalow to clean up ect but I had finished mine so I decided to sit in the main bungalow and watch a DVD and chill for the night until 23:30 which was home time.  I had been sitting there for a while in the sitting room watching a DVD when all of a sudden I had this horrible feeling that something was on the other side of the door in the corridor, I can't describe the feeling other than to say i was pretty much frozen rigid for about 20 minutes, I knew something was out there, And I felt that whatever it was was not good, If that makes sense, It felt like absolute evil was outside that door.  The front door was right outside the sitting room but I had left my bag and stuff on the kitchen table so I knew I had to go and grab them, This feeling was getting worse with every passing minute so after 20 minutes or so I knew I had to get out, I ran into the kitchen, Grabbed my bag and coat, Locked up and ran down to the medical centre to tell them if they wanted to contact me, I would be in another bungalow. The nurse said I looked shook up and asked what was wrong but I couldn't tell her  As soon as i went into another bungalow I felt fine but I was still very shook up, Later on when I was waiting for my taxi outside the scary bungalow (i'd booked it from there because there was a streetlight opposite which made it easier to find for the taxi driver) I could feel somebody looking at me.  A few months later I was working alone in the holidays again,This time in the day, I went into that bungalow and I could hear voices talking, I couldn't fathom out where they came from, They just seemed to coming from thin air, Checked all the rooms and outside, Nobody was about. I quickly locked up and went to another bungalow for the day.  I never really thought much more about it because there didnt seem to be much of an atmosphere when the students were there, But a colleague of mine told me that she had been sleeping in there one night (staff sleep in when the students are there, But thankfully i never did sleep ins) and she had heard people running up and down the corridor, Had got out of bed to check on the students and they were all fast asleep.  Also a few months after what I had experienced, Another member of staff mentioned the same thing happening to her, Even though I had mentioned it to nobody."
horror,3drl96,Little-Baby-Nothing,8,Sat Jul 18 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"One time I was driving home from visiting my sister. It was around 1:30 AM and I was on a pretty unpopulated part of the highway. As I was driving, I saw a woman walking on the side of the road. She was pale with black hair and looked to be in her 30's. She didn't seem too unusual, besides the whole 'walking down a deserted highway at one in the morning' thing. What was very strange, and what I didn't think about until later, was that she didn't seem to react to me driving past at all. She just kept her eyes pointed at the ground in front of her. I felt kinda creeped out by the whole thing, so I decided to just kept driving.  The next day I was talking to my sister on the phone and I told her about what I had seen. She said that her and her husband had seen the same woman near the same place about a week earlier. She said she didn't recognize the woman, which is unusual seeing as she lives in a small town that isn't near many other places. There are also apparently no houses anywhere near where we had seen the woman.   I don't really believe in supernatural stuff, but this is pretty much the closest I've come to something I can't really find a good explanation for. In any case, it was a really creepy experience."

horror,3drl96,dufflebag,8,Sun Jul 19 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"When I was in college I would occasionally stay at the library late to get work done. I would have to walk back to my apartment because the buses did not run past 2 AM. One night I was walking home around 4 in the morning and a man pulls up beside me in a car. He flags me down then pulls in front of me in a driveway to talk. He was older and said he had been injured in an accident and needed some money. He did not seem like he was injured and it did not make sense that he would need money. I tried to tell him to go to the university hospital down the street, but he wouldnt listen and kept rambling. It doesnt sound creepy while writing it, but he gave out this weird vibe and I couldnt seem to tear myself away.  I finally was able to brush him off and leave. The whole way home I was half running and looking over my shoulder. The next day curiosity got the best of me and I started looking online. Turns out there was a suspected serial killer who fit the description of this guy (at least based on vague witness descriptions) who had operated in the area. He was never caught. Needless to say I was shaken for several weeks after."

I live way out in the boonies of butt-fuck nowhere on a farm. I have very few neighbors, but the ones I do have are all registered sex offenders (my dad is a cop and did background checks of the area). We were kind of poor, with nothing of value, except, apparently, myself and my 9 year old brother. They tried to take us.   I remember sleeping soundly in my little pink bed, until I heard my mother shout from downstairs to grab my brother and get down to her. We made it down and hid in my mother's room, with my eldest brother sitting with us with our shotgun. Between my sobs, I heard the footsteps on the roof, walking back and forth, back and forth, like that damn scarecrow story in ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"".    It's hard for me to fully remember the rest, but I remember the cop that came, and found a ladder that was propped up on the house. They got away.   To this day, I deal with my fear, the auditory and visual hallucinations, my inability to trust anyone but my family, and my constant nightmares that I'll open my eyes one night and they'll be there, right over me"

As long as I live I will never, ever forget the cold chill that ran down my spine when I saw it. I froze for a moment, then wordlessly went to get my mom. I showed her and we immediately left the house and went to our neighbor's where we called the police. They didn't find any evidence of forced entry and nothing was missing or disturbed in the house. They had no idea who might have done it, and we never found out.

I suffer from debilitating migraines that I inherited from my mom's side that have some terrifying symptoms. On Easter 2011, I just thought I was having another migraine. I had to visit both sets of my grandparents and all I wanted to do was lie down when the early symptoms of my migraine started showing up, but my family and I had places to go to and people to see.   When we get to my second set of grandparents' house, I feel like total shit. I lie down on their couch and start to twitch a little. It starts in one part of my face and then spread to my arm. The next thing I remember is me slumping over. My mom is a nurse and my grandpa survived a stroke, so they were horrified and thought the worst. My mom tried getting my attention and speaking to me but I was out of it. I regained consciousness, but I couldn't speak. I was scared shitless. Then it felt like my body was frozen but it was flipping around because I was paralyzed.   3 days in the ER, numerous tests, and 4 years later, no doctor has been able to explain what happened to me. My mother, grandmother, and I have all had slurred speech and dizziness/inability to walk straight as a result of migraines, but no one in my family has experience what happened to me. It makes me really afraid to get old or get into some freak accident that makes me paralyzed. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone."

I got the feeling that the audience was supposed to infer that Jay had ""passed"" it on to one or more of the men on the boat; but it was presented so ambiguously and it was unclear if the man on top of her house was one of the men from the boat or her dad, who shows up at the indoor pool."

There was a scene soon after he was shown hitting on those girls, where Jay asks him something about whether or not he ""did it"" and he said something along the lines of ""Not yet, but I have some prospects."" I'm surprised I'm the only one who remembers that scene (though it was definitely kind of mumbled).   Edit: Also there was a small clue my fiancé picked up on that makes it seem more likely that both a) Jay slept with one of the boat guys, and b) Paul slept with one of the hookers. Immediately after each of those scenes, the main character (Jay and then Paul) is shown sleeping. At first I wasn't convinced, but it seems plausible as a clue, since they were finally able to relax a little bit and get some sleep, even if it was brief, before the thing comes after them again now that they passed it on to someone else. I'm almost positive that Jay was only ever shown sleeping immediately after that boat scene (even though everyone else seems to sleep a lot during this movie...)"

horror,3dry01,IamA_Irri,4,Sun Jul 19 06:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I loved Creep, but jump scares are a big part of the film. They're deliberately ""cheap"" and make sense in context considering the characters, but there are still several of them."
horror,3dry01,inthedeepend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:49:49 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, Would You Rather was terrible. I mean, a pornstar is in it, but that's not an issue. It's her fucking acting. Almost all of the acting is terrible, actually. There were four characters who acted well, and three of them are the people you're supposed to hate, but you like them, because the alternative is a bunch of walking planks.   And the stupid twist at the end. There was as much thought out into that twist as there was into breathing. It's so incredibly predictable. Nothing at any point is surprising, and the movie acts like ""Wow I bet you didn't see that coming! See how shocked all the characters are? That's how YOU should feel!""  I very rarely watch a horror movie that I absolutely hate with all my heart. Its normal that I don't like movies, where I just don't enjoy them. I felt that I wasted my time watching this movie. It has two redeeming features; the antagonists' acting, and the music. Literally everything else is a reason the film is bad. The characters, their interactions, the paper-thin stories, and especially the characters themselves.  They try so hard to establish their personalities, and nine times out of ten, it falls flat.   I could probably go on for hours about how much I hate this movie. I absolutely implore anyone ever intending to watch this movie to watch almost literally anything else."

I've heard strange sounds and thought I've seen movement in the dark before, so it wouldn't be the first time.  I have a huge fear of somebody living in my house without my knowledge, or that a crazy killer hid in my closet and has been waiting for me to fall asleep, lol. But both things have happened to people before, so it's not too out there, though a bit paranoid.   So one of my closets has a door that easily comes ajar, just from the wind. You just have to open/close a nearby door and it'll open up a little. I know the exact sound the closet door makes, and many nights while trying to sleep and hearing the various cracks wooden floor and furniture might do, I've been positive I heard the closet door open. The combination of the closet door and the floor sounding like somebody is sneaking around is just too much to ignore."

The very first time, I was on the cusp of sleep and I hear a deep male voice from the foot of my bed say ""Don't ever fall asleep.""  I did not move. I did not look. I stared fixedly at the wall for a very long time until I had convinced myself there really wasn't anything there. Then I turned on all the lights in my room and was finally able to fall asleep.  So moral of the story - I would not do a damn thing but lay there in fear hoping whatever's behind the door doesn't kill me."

horror,3dsbee,GuardRabbit,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"I think Stuckman makes a huge mistake to make it all about gender. Especially as it's made pretty clear that he is perceived as taking on the spider role with his girlfriend (a woman). Enemy is really about the way that our intimate relationships destroy our authentic selves. Think about the blueberries. Does he like blueberries? Does he think he likes blueberries? Why? That's what it's about. Simple as that. It just happens that the protagonist's two most important intimate relationships are with women (his wife and his mother). But that these two characters are female is completely incidental to what the movie is actually about. If you'd have swapped out the mother for a father, for example, you'd have exactly the same movie with exactly the same subject matter.     As for the spider thing, that's just about how such relationships can be perceived as trapping and ensnaring us."

It was heavily edited, as I didn't have cable in my bedroom, but it didn't change how awesome it was to me. Maybe it was my love for the original (which I watched all the time on a VHS my parents recorded off HBO), but I loved it.   Then it ended - or, around the time you see the Michael Jackson zombie - my dad stormed into my room and yelled at me for being up so late watching a movie (it was like 3 in the morning and I was like 10).

Chloe Moretz worked well as awkward scared Carrie, and Julianne Moore was creepy as Carrie's mom, plus all of the bitchy high school girls were good n' bitchy (I usually am not a fan of the teen actors, but thought these kids did a good job).

horror,3dqq59,SauzaPaul,3,Sat Jul 18 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"I was able to watch a TON this week, let's get started  oldies:  Long Weekend (1978) A hateful, bickering couple take a weekend camping retreat and hit nature like a steamroller.  Cigarette butts, chop down trees, run over animals, shoot rifles, etc.  Nature fights back, as birds, snakes, fish and mammals alike all start to attack these jerks!  Fun Aussie stuff.  Wild Beasts - Belve Feroci (1984) Outrageous Italian animals attack flick.  PCP finds its way into the City Zoo's water supply and soon the streets are full of bloodthristy lions and tigers, stampeding elephants and even a bear!  Gore and nudity, this movie delivered the goods.   Mortuary (1983)  Last film of Christopher George (right after Pieces, so goes out on a high note for horror fans) who plays a mortician with a secret and and a weird son (Bill Paxton in one of his first roles) Linda Day George (also from Pieces) is the mom of a teenage girl who appears to be a killer's target.  Some gore, a small bit of nudity, pretty OK 80s flick.  Lady Frankenstein (1971)  Sexy Rosalba Neri plays the title character, just returned from university where she became a surgeon.  Her dad's (Joseph Cotton) creation is already rampaging the countryside, so she creates another one to fight it.  A sexy one!  Lots of nudity, and awful monster makeup.  This was so nice I've seen it twice.    The Mask (1961)  Insane Canadian cheapie about a tribal that makes whomever wear it hallucinate and commit violent crimes.  Three times in the movie, the main character is asked to ""PUT ON THE MASK"" at which time the viewer puts on his 3D glasses and goes on a 5 minute trip with flying skulls, eyeballs, severed arms, and fire, among other things.  Lucky for me I always keep a couple pairs of red & white 3D glasses near my TV!  Lots of fun!   I saw some newer releases too, I'll post those in a bit"
horror,3dqq59,alienhybrid,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"newies:  Honeymoon (2014)  I think most have seen this one already, I'm late to the party.  A honeymooning couple stays at a remote cabin when one of them starts to act strange.  I would think it's best to know as little as possible, so I will stop right there.  Very entertaining slow-burn flick.  Recommended.   The Canal (2014)  Irish ghost story about a guy who's wife turns up dead and he connects it to some 100+ year old murders that occurred in his house.  I didn't like Sinister, and I didn't like this.  Very predictable. It did have some gruesome effects, though.    The Lazarus Effect (2015)  Olivia Wilde and a bunch of sitcom stars create a serum that can revive a dead dog.  A team member dies and guess what?  How did a movie this bad make the theaters, I'd like to know.  I haven't seen every theatrically released horror this year, but this has got to a candidate for the worst.  Seriously, fuck this horrible movie."

I liked how it was a serial killer movie from the perspective of a victim.  It reminded me a lot of my favorite serial killer movie Henry: portrait of a serial killer.   It was unflinching and made even ""creepier"" by the way the story was told.  Look at the first time we are introduced to  peachfuzz.  You know he is making that shit up as he does it.  It was perfect in how it wasn't cinematic.  Right then the audience is in on it.  I immediately said to myself ""my mama was a whore."". I love an unreliable narrator done right.  I'm not exactly sure why but the end totally wrapped everything in a bow for me.  I loved his reasoning and acknowledgment of Aaron's stupidity.  I love how Aaron's bad decisions made him Joseph's favorite person of them all.  It reminded me of a con man I knew retelling his favorite score."

horror,3dot3g,doubtfullyyours,9,Sat Jul 18 00:54:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the horror genre needs more of a discussion. Simply put, it's the most controversial of genres because of what you described: that some of them are just incredibly violent and gory. Some people just can't handle watching them. Myself, I love feeling unnerved, scared, on edge. It's a great adrenaline rush when you get into a movie that really builds.   I think the biggest downfall of the horror genre is the obsequious body horror scenes like ""Hostel"" or ""Saw."" Of course, I love the Saw movies--they're freaking rad. And of course, there's a fair share of B-movies and ones that are just so bad and campy that they can't even fit into the B-movie mold like Dead/Alive or The Blob.   If your friends are uneasy about horror, you could try to turn them on with more psychological horror films like Oculus or The Babadook; and hey, even if I didn't like It Follows, they might really like it. I only say that because of any genre, horror is the one where people can't always handle jumping into the deep end. If you're introducing more horror to someone who doesn't watch it very often, would you make them watch A Serbian Film first, or Misery? Evil Dead or Oculus?   As for the debate, some time ago, I mentioned once that an ex-boyfriend's friend tried to put on me on trial for loving horror. She made it a huge point to my ex of how ""uncomfortable"" it made her feel, ""I just don't understand"", ""Why would he like all that dark shit?""  Anyway, she asked me why I liked horror. And my response, I'll stick to it to this day, was, ""I love horror because I love life."" It was pretty plain and simple to me. She asked me to elaborate, which baffled her, but it really shut her the hell up.   I said, ""Horror is about the darkness, the despair, the fear. And once it's all over, you get to appreciate all the good things in your life even more: love, light, and life.""  Horror has always been a genre that played on the dark aspects of the human experience. It's an ever-changing, ever-evolving genre, that the others can't boast to do, simply because in a lot of ways, fear drives us. Generally speaking, we try to make sure our fears don't become reality. If we think about ""Night of the Living Dead"", on the surface, zombies are scary! But are we really scared by the zombies in the movies, or what they represent: A mindless, soulless society only being driven by base needs instead of living a fulfilling and enriching life?  Or in possession movies, a fear highlighted by losing complete control and autonomy, being taken over by an even more powerful mind?   Horror is about confronting our shadow selves. There's a reason why we fear the things we do.   ""The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself."" ~John F. Kennedy"
horror,3dot3g,WildRaphy,6,Sat Jul 18 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" - Aristotle  I, for one, have never been able to understand people who don't indulge their innate sense of curiosity. By way of nature, we are all curious beings. I see a fascination with the ""darkness"" in horror to be an exercise in curiosity.  By extension, I have always looked at people who profess a vehement dislike of horror as completely aberrant. Ironically enough, the same people seem to take so much pleasure in the suffering of others on a day-to-day basis. The Germans call it ""schadenfreude."" They are the gossipy type: we all know at least one. They claim that horror films deeply offend them. But they are often the very first to crane their necks at the sight of a deadly highway crash.   It's been my observation (and there are always exceptions to this) that some of the most zealous horror fans are among the kindest and unassuming individuals I've met.   I echo your sentiments!"
horror,3dot3g,savantarde,3,Sat Jul 18 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn something pretty funny, is that horror is my FAVORITE genre; it's my go-to. Whenever someone tells me to pick out a movie, I hit the horror section first. I LOVE horror. On the other side of the WildRaphy coin, my career choice involves helping and taking care of other people, and I am appalled at hearing any kind of abuse taking place. If I ever witnessed it with my own eyes, I know I'd be pretty pissed and take all necessary precautions without a second's hesitation.  And I see your point; I've seen that same hypocrisy in other people. They shun anything deemed unsettling and scary, and yet, are so overly fixated on recent shootings, fatal accidents, acts of terror, etc.. And yeah, there are always exceptions. I think the biggest problem I have is feeling judged, like I'm just some really disturbed person for my love of horror films, and can't be trusted or I'm some deviant or have subconscious urges to murder people or something. Well, I am me, like it or not. I bet it bothers them that I could be a better well-adjusted person in modern society than they are."

Sure some people are hypocrites, but to suggest that the majority of people that don't like the horror genre ""take so much pleasure in the suffering of others on a day-to-day basis"" is silly."
horror,3dot3g,NotWithoutIncident,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"I never once said that all people who dislike horror are like that. I was responding to WildRaphy's sentiment: that there are people that ""doth protest too much."" In my experience. Note that I qualified my description above with the following words: vehement dislike..."
horror,3dot3g,savantarde,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"Well said. You seem to have such an intuitive grasp of the sort of philosophical subtext of the Horror genre, I am surprised that you didn't like It Follows."
horror,3dot3g,Trogpint,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, believe me, I really liked the premise, but not the execution. I had too many questions left unrealized at the end of the film. Normally, I'm all for movies that really make you think and question if it was all real or not (I'm looking at you Babadook!), but there were scenes in It Follows that seemed much too arbitrary. For example, despite some initial creepiness of the scene, them ""just hanging out"" on a lake front beach until It caught up to them didn't really do it for me.   But, as I say, to each their own. A lot of people really like the movie. I'm just one of those few who didn't. shrug"
horror,3dot3g,WildRaphy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. One of the things that I thought was clever about the film was that a lot of the settings were in the daylight, open space, bright sunshine with lot's of people around, like the beach. Most filmmaker's go-to settings for Horror are usually something enclosed, dark and isolated, with lots of creepy hiding places for ""it"" to jump out at you. To me, the beach location seemed very deliberate and not arbitrary at all."
horror,3dot3g,Trogpint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:57 2015 UTC,It Follows: A movie made by hipsters for hipsters and critics who don't like horror movies. Or at least that's what it felt like.

horror,3dot3g,Bovolt,3,Sat Jul 18 23:20:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, horror has a stigma of just being a cheap classless genre. There's a reason why people try to distance good movies from the horror genre. That's why we have, like what you said, suspense, and dark genres.  If you can, try to find some middle ground films. Something between stuff like Cape Fear/Se7en and more generic horror films. As much as I find both films overrated, The Babadook and It Follows would probably be good films to expose them to if you want their definitions broadened."
horror,3dot3g,99and1halfdays,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:19 2015 UTC,I considered se7en and cape and such to be thrillers and not horror.
horror,3dot3g,ljzls,3,Sat Jul 18 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"Horror is just another kind of story telling where the goal is to unsettle or explore the unsettling. There's lots of room for imagination and ideas to explore that you don't get as much of in other genres. It's fun, like Halloween."

horror,3dot3g,sandhouse,2,Sat Jul 18 07:12:37 2015 UTC,I have this problem with science fiction too. My argument is simple and if they still don't agree then whatever. It's this: Look at the word science fiction. Does the story involve science and fiction? It's scifi. So The Martian by Andy Weir and The Hunger Games are scifi. It's the same with horror but even more simple. Does the story horrify you? It's horror. Done.  EDIT: I love scifi horror stories!
horror,3dot3g,party_squad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:58:32 2015 UTC,Pretty much my exact thoughts!
horror,3dot3g,Cheeze-h0rr0rfan,2,Sat Jul 18 23:15:14 2015 UTC,"The very idea that horror is a ""genre"" whereas other story types (like coming of age) are considered ""literary"" really frustrates me. The idea of ""literary fiction"" versus ""genre fiction"" is so frustrating to me.  I find The Shining to be of comparable quality to Foxcatcher or Chinatown. Like Henry James, and Edith Wharton, HP Lovecraft's texts have been accepted into the American Library canon. People also tend to be far more interested in reading and watching so-called ""genre tales"" like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.   Even people who earn their living by deciding what is worthy and what is not will stay up into the night watching a season of Game of Thrones, or reading the latest Harry Potter on the ride home from buying it and into the morning, but slog through their cherished literary works over days and weeks, only to writer equally boring reviews for their dwindling readership.  Genre is useful in that it can tell us a few things about what we're about to read, watch or play. If I say, ""It's horror"" you might expect something chilling or horrific, potentially with violent acts or supernatural shit. So if your friends are simply not interested in that kind of material, or in feeling grossed out or shocked or frightened, then they might avoid the horror genre. This makes sense to me, and tastes are tastes.   For whatever reason, they may prefer a thriller, which is chilling and thrilling, but generally speaking tends to fall within the rules of reality, at least as far as Hollywood goes. Again, this is a way of categorizing material based on content and what kind of a response you may be looking for, so I get it.  But then there are people that as a rule will only read the newest autobiography by a depressed intellectual in Sweden, because they'd be wasting their time on ""genre fiction."" If your friends condemn horror as somehow being less artful, or inferior to dramas, then it's time to find some new tv/movie talk about art buddies, and stick to beer and Game of Thrones chatter with the blokes you're chilling with. Because you're surrounded by snobs!   But you can have an inside laugh knowing that by loving Game of Thrones or Lost or the Walking Dead (and who doesn't?), they are pledging allegiance to fantasy and horror without even knowing it!"
horror,3dot3g,NotWithoutIncident,2,Sat Jul 18 06:00:50 2015 UTC,"I would say that each horror fan appreciates different films from the many, many, subgenres out there; which are what I would argue some of the distinctions you mentioned. For example, Cape Fear and Se7en are psychological thrillers and I consider that a subgenre of horror. I would say that the discrepancies come from preference amongst fans and exposure amongst casual viewers. I am a huge horror fan, but there are definitely subgenres I prefer over others and really that just means style and concept. They were created to help us categorize the type of film. Some films reach into various categories. I would also say that it depends on what they are exposed if they are just just casual viewers. I find they tend to watch the jump scare style films that are popularly wide released. They are also more aware of the most popular horror films and this forms a narrow definition of the genre. When you dig deep, there is a lot of depth to the genre just like any other. So I would just suggest that they watch certain films that would break the mold a little bit and challenge their perception of horror just being a superficial jump scare genre or a hack and slash fest. There are way too many films to list so I would recommend the documentary, Nightmares in Red, White and Blue (2009), because it details the rise of the American Horror film. It goes into the roots, inspirations and meanings behind the films from the 1910s all the way to the 2000s. It might inspire them to watch certain films and have a deeper understanding of the genre."
horror,3dot3g,99and1halfdays,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughts! Agreed about the type of movies getting exposure certainly playing a big part in characterizing the face of horror right now.  I've been putting off Nightmares in Red, White and Blue because it sounded a tad generic, but I'll have to give it a try!"
horror,3dot3g,taterbizkit,2,Sat Jul 18 23:06:56 2015 UTC,"I love horror movies, and it sounds like you do too, but everyone doesn't have to. Honestly, I think you're trying to make the horror genre too broad just to ""trick"" people into liking horror if you include stuff like Se7en and Blood Simple.  Genres aren't objective measures of anything. They're subjective categories that only have meaning because people generally agree on what films go in what categories. If your friends don't like the movies that most film fans consider horror, your friends don't like horror. I don't see why it has to be more complicated than that.   Fans of ""genre"" entertainment often have this issue where they feel like they aren't getting the respect they deserve. Sci-fi fans have been having this argument about literary sci-fi (Vonnegut etc.) vs. genre sci-fi (Heinlein or whoever) for decades. The only takeaway from all the words wasted on that topic is that trying to absorb content into your genre (""Why can't everyone else see that Borges is sci-fi!?"") is a waste of time and doesn't benefit genre fans or people that dismiss the genre.  If you really want to share your love of horror with your friends, instead of trying to convince them that movies they already like are horror movies, try to find a horror genre movie that fits into their other interests. If your friends respect your opinion at all I can't imagine them refusing to watch it if you say, ""Hey, I have this horror movie that's a lot like X and Y, so I think you'll really like it."""

I liked both but the remake was both respectful, had an interesting new twist, in terms of almost entirely being FPV, and ultimately a more believable film.  I liked how Euro it felt, while constantly having flashbacks to where I used to live (most of it was filmed within blocks of where I used to live in Downtown LA).  The cinematography is stellar.  It gives a fantastic tone to the picture.  I listened to the awesome score by Rob, regularly, for at least six months before the picture was available in the States.  I loved picking up on the big homage to Giorgio Moroder and his Cat People score."

The music was chilling and perfectly written for the film. I still listen to it pretty often. Elijah Wood was creepy as hell, and I'm really happy he can do a variety of roles.   I didn't think they could make a first person movie interesting or even enjoyable, but I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.   This movie made me so damn uncomfortable, and I loved every minute of it.

Our distributor says Netflix is taking 75% less films than they used to. We are on Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus though. Now Shudder, which I had no idea about and gotta ask what that deal was.   I welcome services like Shudder, though it will almost certainly fail, because I really hate the direction Netflix is going in. They spend FAR too much money on original content. They were offered a license for our movie for several years for $5,000. At that price, Netflix could license 8,000 indie movies for the cost of producing one season of Hemlock Grove. I'll take 16,000 hours of content over 12 hours of content thank you."
horror,3do1be,willreignsomnipotent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"You have an excellent point, and an interesting perspective.  However to play devil's advocate, I think I can see where their minds are at. Shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards are getting major recognition for netflix. It's put them on the same playing field as traditional cable networks-- which is a huge leap for an internet streaming service. 10 years ago it would have been unheard of.   So obviously, now that they've developed some winning series that people want to tune in for (and more importantly, which they legally cannot get elsewhere) it makes sense that Netflix wants to develop these properties... as well as find their next ""big thing.""   It does make a certain kind of sense from a business perspective.  But I would agree that if they sacrifice too much variety (by not licensing more outside properties) for the sake of original content, they may end up with dissatisfied customers....  (EDIT:  For the record, I kind of agree with your point. IMHO variety is vital for a streaming service. But I'm not gonna lie... OITNB is one of the best new tv series I've seen in a while...)"

It's all a couple grand here and a couple grand there.    Of course, to be fair, it's their original programming that gets new subscribers.  Hulu has tons more indie films and obscure international films plus the Criterion Collection.  For about the same subscription fee they do about 20% of the revenue of Netflix.   I only know one other person that I know for sure has a subscription to Hulu.

Right from the beginning when the birthday party goes wrong and you see the big dog watching everyone you just feel really disturbed and that feeling lingers throughout the whole movie. The Exorcist - While there is actually a kind of 'monster' in this, it doesn't really walk around killing people and what makes the film great is just how disturbing the exorcism scenes are even though the 'monster' is actually tied down. The scene in the desert with those dogs/jackals barking and going apeshit and that strange statue made me very creeped out the second I saw it and I'll remember it forever."
horror,3dnmeh,RobAChurch,3,Fri Jul 17 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"Th Strangers and When a Stranger Calls left me disturbed and terrified when I was younger just cause it felt so real. It could happen.  Not horror by tradition, but a couple scenes in Trainspotters and Requiem for a Dream.  I just saw Creep today and the buildup and tension was so great, thrown in with some dark comedy. It was a great indie horror!  That fucking ending to The Kill List and Antichrist though....  Citadel and Absentia are great low budget indie horrors with some subtle, disturbing moments."

horror,3dnmeh,Everyscene,3,Sat Jul 18 02:44:50 2015 UTC,Fire in the Sky is one I can't shake. But that's mainly because I watched to many episodes of Unsolved Mysteries and Sightings as a kid. Greys freak me out.
horror,3dnmeh,doctoredjnr,3,Fri Jul 17 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Not necessarily 'horror' but Snowtown is one of the most disturbing films I've seen. I'm not sure if it was because I wasn't expecting anything just a random film to watch and it blew me away.
horror,3dnmeh,Everyscene,2,Sat Jul 18 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"Snowtown is an amazing film, incredibly disturbing but amazing. The horror aspect (for me at least) two part. One it is that it is based on a true story, and that it stays close to the what actually happened, in the places it diverted from what actually happened it tones things down. John Bunting and Robert Wagner are the closest thing to pure evil that I have ever come across. Two it shows how easily otherwise normal people can be sucked in to do horrible evil things."

Also, I just posted a big long review in another thread here about Maniac (2012). It is a slasher and it is fairly gory, but it doesn't rely on that to be creepy. Elijah Wood is absolutely terrifying as a protagonist/serial killer, and watching everything through his eyes, along with a killer (;D) soundtrack make the movie unsettling even after the credits have rolled."

So far there's Lakeview Cabin III and IV, with at least two more updates in store.  I got myself involved in doing trailers for the games as I felt like the game was unlike any other horror title out there: the goal isn't to hide, or to mow down monsters with overpowered weapons.  You are pretty much put in the same situation as a Crystal Lake councilor or group of friends in a broken down van.  You can kill your enemies, but they have a lot more experience in killing so it'll be difficult."

The scene where Aaron is sleeping with the cam filming him and Joseph picks it up and films him totally reminded me of an identical scene in a slightly older but still relatively recent film, except I'm pretty sure it involved a girl filming herself and someone picks up the camera and films her, but I can't remember what movie it is.

horror,3dikod,fedaykin13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:58:45 2015 UTC,Definitely worth a watch.  I didn't love it. I thought the 'creep' was great. he totally worked and his performance turned this movie into something more than it was on paper.  The camera guy was kind of weak. I'm sure that was by design but he had no personality so it was tough to 'care' about his situation.

It was insanely predictable and I didn't find it funny at all. Call it what you want, but I found it slow, predictable, and boring.  I've said it multiple times, this is at the bottom of the found footage list for me, right next to Apollo 18."

This movie was to me very good compared to all the shit horror mainstream movies i see hyped up anymore but its not without its flaws. It kept me hooked the whole time watching and even though when you gwt done with it its one of those movies you're gonna want to watch again for little details. I also felt kinda paranoid after watching this which to me is the mark of a good horror film, when it makes you think and feel days after watching. Id give it a solid 7/10.

The fact that they massively expanded the theater release is what convinced me to pony up and hit the cinema, and of the group of 4 of us, we all felt very differently coming out of the film. But we all agreed it was a good watch and well worth the time. Though we are also from the area it was filmed in so there may have been a bit of local and indie pride mixed in.

horror,3do84b,dances_with_dongs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"Spoiler information here!!! Do not read if you haven't seen.  It could be a metaphor for how grief can destroy you if you let it. So the mother was tormented by the the death of her husband and she let her son's imagination get a hold of her in her troubled state. She was literally going crazy and going to kill her son. The ""possession"" could have been her letting the monster overcome her and she truly was no longer herself. She chose to get over it at the end and face her grief. So I think its debatable that the Babadook was metaphorical."
horror,3do84b,dances_with_dongs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Man, i really didnt understand the babadook, hella scary but i dont know what really happend, so the babadook wasnt real, but she was juts kind of sick"
horror,3do84b,dances_with_dongs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is my take on it. She didn't even want anyone saying her husband's name. She was in denial and hiding for years. Her son was like this daily reminder of it though. So in essence his imagination is what I think created the Babadook. We knew going in he believed in imaginary monsters, so we could take that as evidence. There were so many things going on in their lives at the time of this new monster he was scared of. He said ""don't let it in"" as in don't let it take over her. But she did because that was easier than just letting go at first. I might be reading too much into it, but I see a lot of symbolism."

They apparently think these indigenous people lack agency and can't make decisions for themselves, and are being ""tricked"" into appearing in these films. It's all just mindless speculation. I heard a woman on a podcast rant about this for 10 minutes, and she provided zero evidence to back up her claims. It's absolute nonsense."

That is an utterly stupid argument that only highlights the kind of racism that these people are talking about.  Just because a person is ethnically indigenous, that doesn't mean they have any connection to present day hunter-gatherer peoples or any interest in protecting their cultures.  Your argument is akin to saying ""Well, German Jews were white, and these Californian actors are white, so a movie which depicts the victims of the Holocaust as evil baby-eaters can't be anti-Semetic, because that implies white people lack the agency and ability to make decisions for themselves.""  Absolute nonsense indeed."
horror,3dj0tc,Ahhuatl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:54 2015 UTC,So are you saying that this is a genre of film that shouldn't exist because it's inherently racist?
horror,3dj0tc,gary_brambleton,-6,Thu Jul 16 20:57:01 2015 UTC,"No, I am saying using overtly racist troupes is racist.   You can do a cannibal movie without racist concepts in it.  To suggest otherwise is like claiming that every basketball movie needs a black protagonist who eats chicken and watermelon between games. Dumplings, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hannibal, there have been a number of good movies about cannibalism that aren't racist."
horror,3dj0tc,Ahhuatl,3,Thu Jul 16 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"But you do think that any cannibal film featuring indigenous actors is wrong, even if the actors genuinely enjoyed the experience? Do you also think that ""redneck horror"" is offensive? I'm genuinely curious and not trying to attack your opinion."
horror,3dj0tc,gary_brambleton,-6,Thu Jul 16 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"But you do think that any cannibal film featuring indigenous actors is wrong, even if the actors genuinely enjoyed the experience?   Am I speaking Chinese here or something?  Just because a person has a particular skin color, that doesn't mean they have any relationship to to the people who are being degraded in a movie.  I am saying it doesn't matter whether or not these actors enjoyed the movie because they have no connection to the kind of cultures that are being demonized in this movie.  They don't all live in hunter-gatherer communities, they don't all have an investment in the survival of hunter-gatherer communities, they are complete outsiders to hunter-gatherer communities, just like a white New Yorker or a Chinese individual who lives in Beijing. The idea that their feelings on the matter some how make the movie not-racist is in and of itself a racist sentiment, because the ONLY reason that argument is being made is because of their racial background.     Do you also think that ""redneck horror"" is offensive?   Of course.    Now tell me, if a white SJW starred in a redneck horror movie that depicted all white southerners as people who enjoyed fucking their children, would we seriously accept that said movie wasn't hateful and slanderous simply because the SJW star said they enjoyed it and their skin is white?  Of course not. We'd recognize that their cultural and political affiliation makes them distinct from ""rednecks"" and that their skin color doesn't mean they have any investment in seeing ""rednecks"" treated fairly or with respect.  This is just as applicable to the actors in this movie.  Having indigenous blood doesn't mean you have personal connection to the kind of culture seen in this movie.  Hell, in Latin American society most people have indigenous blood but still hate indigenous peoples.  This logic of ""Well they're fucking brown and all brown people are the same so its OK"" is outrageously racist."
horror,3dj0tc,Ahhuatl,5,Thu Jul 16 21:30:36 2015 UTC,But the actors in Green Inferno ARE actual indigenous people- they weren't flown in from other places. These people are literally hunter-gatherers. Are you aware of that?
horror,3dj0tc,gary_brambleton,-6,Thu Jul 16 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Good lord, I must be speaking Chinese.   Setting aside the fact that no, not all of the actors who play indigenous characters belong to hunter-gatherer societies, let us again try an analogy.  A SJW lives in America, they both belong to industrial societies, they both speak the same languages, so obviously that means that because a SJW wouldn't have a problem with mocking rednecks, it is not degrading, at all right?  ""Indigenous"" is a Western construct.  When the people in question see a hunter-gatherer society depicted in a film, they don't see themselves as the fictional society any more than an American watching Game of Thrones goes ""Hey, that is the United States!"".     Just because westerners group these people under a single identity, that doesn't mean they do and consequentially that doesn't mean they look at a film in the same way.   The ""cannibal primitive"" troupe exists in OUR culture.  It is degrading and offensive in OUR culture.  Just because it is alien to these people, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a racist intent, message, and impact in our culture."

To shoot this film, they actually found a tribe in South America that agreed to be in it."

My opinion is who cares. Movies, and especially horror, can play with racism and illogical fears all they want to tell a story. If you have a problem with how people are being educated because of the film then tell a better story. Raise some money and put up a website that educates visitors about the film and indigenous tribes.   Just stop arguing with /u/Ahhuatl He's quick to insult or talk down to people when he gets frustrated. That's someone who is prioritizing making you feel bad over being understood."

When you think someone is close to you but in reality is only acting this way to get close to his enemy (which is you) and doesn't actually like you. Insects. Religious ghosts and supernatural beings   Bonus by me   I'm kind of freaked when I'm sitting in the living room by myself with open windows because I'm scared that someone will slowly climb in the window, revealing herself and slowly walking towards me with a grin on her face.   Also here's a gross out scare for you:  WARNING!!!!! MIGHT MAKE SLEEPING HARD BECAUSE IT'S A DISGUSTING THING THAT INVOLVES BEDS!!!!!  This happened to my friend and I think this would work very well in a horror movie, you try to clean your room and you start with your bed. You lift the mattress and there are thousands tiny bugs and a centipede under there. And the instant you lift the mattress they scatter around the room.  WARNING!!!!!

horror,3dj64c,horrorinpureform,3,Fri Jul 17 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"First off, I agree that the production design is gorgeous.  But I think the film is far too fast and loose with not only its plotting but also with its characterization. For example, why does Weyland hide himself from the rest of the crew? I get cryosleep, but why the subterfuge? What does that gain him? Why is the biologist more afraid of a skeleton than of a living creature clearly in a rigid attack stance? Remember that Shaw is incapable of conceiving - why then isn't she an utterly broken soul when the universe so completely conspires against her as to put a monster in her belly? Why does she not give a single fuck about that? Why is it relevant to Vickers that she be Weyland's daughter? What does that bring to her character? A chip on her shoulder? If so, why wait to give us that information until late in the film? Wouldn't it be better to know that earlier, so we can have a perspective on her instead of just a mild sort of ""wonder what her deal is""?  That's without getting into the absurd plotting."
horror,3dj64c,oslowa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:12:38 2015 UTC,Spoilers  I think Weyland hides himself to help conceal his actual agenda. If the crew doesn't know then the crew doesn't ask. So many people rip on the Millburn snake scene and it's not perfect but how about when Kane touches the egg in Alien? Then after it opens he proceeds to reach inside? These things don't ruin movies. Shaw doesn't have time to feel utterly broken about her baby situation because at the time they're getting ready to go wake up the Engineer. It's good to consider that however because it showed her almost breaking down about that before and builds the character development even further. She'll be in future movies so that's important. Vickers being Weylands daughter gives her invested interest in the mission and revealing things like this late adds to the rewatchability.   I've spoken quite a bit on the plot. Like many horror and sci-fi movies making a defence for it or ripping it apart isn't so hard to do.
horror,3dj64c,Trogpint,4,Fri Jul 17 03:36:11 2015 UTC,"I think it is just down to what kind of films you like. You say this is ""horror"" so ""what does logic have to do with it"". Some of us like our horror movies to have intelligent scripts and characters, we are not all Annabelle or Human Centipede kind of horror fans, so for people like that, the complete lack of intelligence/logic of the script does mar the experience quite much. I personally can't take a movie where people run away from rolling objects looney tunes style, or where biologists follow zero protocol on an alien planet, seriously. It takes it beyond ""slightly silly"" into ridiculous and comical territory."
horror,3dj64c,Schmolo,3,Thu Jul 16 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"Spoilers  Don't get me wrong, I like my horror as smart as the next fan but I saw criticisms of everything from the Juggernauts lack of propulsion to questioning David's ability to make sense of the Engineers' language. Things like these don't need logic to me because we're in the future and in the Alien universe.  I'm with you on the rolling object looney tunes thing. I was yelling ""turn right!"" in my head during that scene. But she was in an extremely high pressure situation and some people don't have that kind of smarts. Millburn's encounter with the snake alien is kind of ridiculous however there are deleted scenes showing his curiosity and fascination with these creatures. That scene would have provided some logic into his actions. Is it enough to ruin the movie though? Alien had a sub plot about a cat and everybody loves Alien. I'm not saying it's the same but I'm just trying to get across that this film has been picked apart and scrutinized harshly."

That, and bringing back the puppet designs and incredible stop-motion FX that made the original 5 so memorable, but with a bigger budget to iron out the iffier bits.  My vision would begin with a remake of the first Puppet Master film, but with a heightened mystery element, more ambiguity/buildup before the puppets are confirmed to be alive, and a greater emphasis on Toulon's backstory (while keeping his morality ambiguous). Which would leave uninitiated viewers to wonder who the ""killer"" is and build suspense, rather than dropping so many hints and showcasing gore early on. It'd require a longer runtime, and probably more characters as well.  Of course, this is the unlikeliest of dreams to come true. There will probably be a Puppet Master reboot eventually, but my guess is it'll be full of CGI and superfluous action in the place of horror :P"

Have an all powerful Freddy displaying vast, imaginative dreamscapes and fighting a crew of teenagers who've enabled themselves with different abilities.  Maybe have the teens flee Springwood together and crash their car after the driver gets drowsy; keep the teens in a coma the last two thirds of the movie so that the focus is on Freddy's Labyrinth instead of the drama of the real world.  I'd also love a Jason reboot that explored his time after crawling back out of Crystal Lake, that acted as more of a sympathetic monster movie focusing on him and his survival. Have him tote around his mom's head, maybe get picked up by a traveling freak show for a stint, learning the need to eradicate humanity."

I've read his collection of short stories 20th Century Ghost, which I really enjoyed. I've got Horns on my to-watch list but I keep telling myself I want to read the book first.    The original Fright Night is one of my all time favorites, any movie is better with Roddy McDowall!       Any ideas what you are watching tonight?

Tonight I am probably going to finish 3rd Rock from the Sun (I have been hooked on 90's sitcoms as well as horror lately).

And if you are a fan of the Fright Night universe, they also released a remake/reboot/sequel/requel called Fright Night Part 2 as a direct-to-video thing in 2013(?). It's more or less exactly the same story as told in the original and the remake, but takes place with students on a trip in Romania. I think it was pretty quality for a no-budget cash-in production, and worth checking out if you're running low on options for 100 Nights."

Every time I talk with one of them, to this day, one of us tends to say ""Oh, we'll GET the shit"" to the other.  At the time, I had no idea what the song ""Strange Fruit"" was, and why they would have played it during the scene where the police beat the politician to death--it's because that's a protest song against lynching. The director is explicitly saying that the cops are murdering their victim for no other reason than he's black and they can get away with it.  If it weren't for what I assume is a matting / compositing error in the voodoo doll segment that makes the dolls look too brightly lit to be in the same scene as the actors, this film would be perfect. As it is, it's just a fiercely angry masterpiece that tries to look like Amicus and the people behind ""The Spook Who Sat By the Door"" got together to make a socially conscious horror anthology."

This interview seems like a stupid PR stunt, like he's talking ahead of time about how it will be perceived, not what it's actually about. Anyone talking up their movie about who they think it's going to offend is playing a game I really don't care about.  I mean there's something to be said about white American kids with a savior complex thinking they have the means to solve complex world issues just by their presence, but that's about a lot more than just SJWs, whatever that word even means anymore. And it's something I've seen criticized a lot in SJW-labeled spaces, and I've also seen that criticism labeled by anti-SJWs as anti-white racism.  I dunno, I thought the Hostel movies (and the new Hills Have Eyes, Saw 3+, other movies in that genre) were kind of a low point in modern horror, so I doubt I'll bother with it anyway."

This is correct, and what Roth himself says in the interview, not just the clickbait title.  His original inspiration way people tweeting about Kony2012, but from there evolved into a movie about actual activists.  From Roth:   Or you see people get involved in a cause that they don’t really know a lot about and they go crazy about it. I wanted to make a movie about kids like that. I think there’s a lot great things, obviously, about activism people commit their lives to it. But I want to make a story about kids who don’t really know what they’re getting into. Get in way over their heads, it actually works.

horror,3dehkh,WitOfTheIrish,5,Wed Jul 15 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"""He's got no substance"" is a pretty loaded statement. You're basically assuming a (horror) film HAS to have ""substance"" (whatever you define that to be) to be a successful film.   Roth has been a staple in the horror genre for many years, and has been a significant force in modern body horror and torture films. That being said, pulling ""substance"" from horror films is a stretch. While it can be and has been done, it doesn't have to always be done, and in fact is often not done, yet these films are equally as thrilling.   It's taking relatively unused horror tropes and current events and meshing them together to make a new horror film that's not really ""about"" anything. People don't leave horror films thinking about how they want to end racism, they leave thinking they had a blast, and that's why horror exists as a genre."

If horror is touched the way video games are being (see, told you I was sincere), then we will lose it completely.

You could pretty much replace the terms ""SJW"" and ""MRA"" in this argument with any other polar political opposites and be having the exact same conversation. Have a look at the news. Everybody thinks the media is biased against their side.  You're both right. Most people on most sides of most issues resort to that kind of namecalling when they're about to lose an argument. It's not because one side or the other is just full of assholes and thus obviously wrong, it's because human brains are pieces of shit and we're programmed to line up in opposing teams and fight like this.  I've been rejected as Clearly Just A Troll by both sides of the MRA/SJW wars. Honestly, they both piss me off. Some of my friends get really annoyed at me for being a feminist who clings to the term ""Social Justice Warrior"", but I have yet to find a term that describes the self-righteous crusader mentality of these kids quite as well. But I've also seen how vicious the other side can get, and I've had close friends receive rape threats just for disagreeing with Gamergaters drunk on their own egos.  Anyone who applies ""SJW"" to the whole of feminism is, IMHO, being a willfully obtuse dick. But the social justice movement can also be real prone to dickish namecalling tactics when confronted with ideas that don't fit standard dogma. (I'm quasi-trans and I've been given shit by radfems for saying I don't need surgery. Fuck that.)  Anyhow. Wall of text. You're both partly right and partly wrong. Thanks for listening."

It's a heightened sense of melodrama. And saying that the characters are ""unlikable"" has never been a good factor in deciding if something is good. A lot of great movies and shows have unlikable characters. Look at Vegeta one of the most popular anime character. He's a brazen self-entitled asshole who is generally a dick but everyone loves him.  As for the characters in Attack on Titan? The three main character represent a different facet of humanity.   -Eren is the spirit; as he's all emotions and brashness.   -Armin represents the mind as he's the smartest but not much else.  -Mikasa is the body as she is all survival and skill but with not many emotional traits.   They aren't really characters as more symbols for what makes humanity, it's a long running theme for the show. Not that the concept is ground breaking; Legend of Zelda has the same trinity theme (Courage, Wisdom, Power). But hashing it down to ""meh"" and ""unlikable"" is discrediting a show that actually some depth. And not to forget the J.J. Abraham-like mystery box surely has a lot of people hooked as the show dangles so many mysteries from the get-go."

Honestly, after watching a bunch of dark/disturbing scenes last night, I'm not convinced that it wasn't Disney movies that got me into horror. Older Disney movies (but even into the 90s) handled much more adult themes, protagonists often seemed like they were in real danger, deaths (especially villain deaths) were brutal and not really sugar-coated aside from not typically showing corpses, and there were visual effects used to make villains seem scarier (these are used to great effect in both Pinocchio during the Monstro scenes and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad during the Headless Horseman chase). Hell, Lampwick turning into a donkey is basically a child's introduction to body horror.  I like modern animated films fine, but they have really lost the juxtaposition of lightheartedness with scariness that many older films had. The most recent comparable scene I can think of is the incinerator in Toy Story 3."

I played through the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series AND the recent masterpiece ""The Last of Us"".  I also enjoy my share of B-horror movies, for kicks.  My favorite horror sub-genre is still the zombie apocalyptic scenario. It's just plausible to me. I mean why not? A deadly virus infecting the mammalian species causing them to die, and as corpses feed on the living... Sounds plausible to me!"
horror,3dg8w2,Ima_Red,3,Thu Jul 16 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting story because I've really looked back on it and narrowed down a lot of precise moments.  Long read incoming (As if you couldn't already see that).  Because my dad is awesome, the first movies I ever remember seeing, outside of Disney movies, were Aliens (terrifying), Terminator (those horrible red eyes), Critters (those eyes again), and E.T. Remarkably, it was E.T. that made the most impact on me as a kid because it's not a horror movie. But the scene when Elliott first sees E.T. in the cornfield scared the pants off me as a kid and I avoided E.T. for a long time because of that scene alone.  For a long time, I avoided horror movies because, like most kids my age, I didn't like to be scared.    Years later, I would reluctantly re-watch E.T. and I was in Elliott's symbolic shoes as, the cornfield scene freaked me out a second time but I stuck it out. Later, Elliott faced the ""monster"" for his second time and was scared stiff when it approached but, due to Spielberg's genius, the alien proved to be more worthy of my pity than my fear. This opened my mind and it perfectly reflects my relationship from my fearful introduction to my gradual acceptance, then eventual love for the horror genre.  Later in my early teens, the Goosebumps books helped me get more into horror. Then, inspired by my father and Robin Williams in Jumanji (R.I.P.), ""If you are afraid of something, you face it like a man."" This helped me get over my fear of shots (needles).  It was around that time that the American remake of Japanese Horror like The Ring and The Grudge (those damn eyes again) reintroduced me to the horror genre, but while I did reel back because of the triggers, I found a bizarre appeal/curiosity to it as well. This appeal/curiosity kept drawing me back and somewhat made horror films a way to face my fears.    Now, I'm really into films in general and horror is a particularly favorite genre because I've been able to look back and realize how much horror and horror films have affected my life.  I now watch horror films for the gems that affect me and it brings me more joy than most other things on this world.  Thanks for reading."

horror,3dg8w2,KingKyuss,3,Thu Jul 16 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"For me it was Hammer Horror. Through my Dad's influence, I first saw Scars of Dracula when I was about 7 or 8 and soon after that saw Lust for a Vampire, very age inappropriate. I just really liked them. I was pretty easily scared as a youngen, so I found my brother taunts of, ""If you watch the Evil Dead, you're a real man"" pretty intimidating and made me think of how scary that movie must be. Hammer Horror wasn't scary, so I just watched them. Then my Dad started buying Hammer movies as he found them. I even bought a box set of Hammer Horror, which included Vampire Circus, Hands of the Ripper and Twins of Evil, with the money I got for my 12th birthday, my family could've legitimately sued the store I got it from for selling R18+ material to a 12 year old."

I am a more recent horror movie enthusiast, and was first drawn in by Absentia (2011). It was the first time I realized that indie horror was often great, sometimes original, and usually far better than the modern Hollywood horror that I was so tired of. For the last year or so since watching it, I have slowly but steadily been exploring the genre, and have recently started watching and gaining an appreciation for some of the classics (pre-Golden Age I guess). I've barely scratched the surface, which is both exciting and frustrating at the same time.  Edit: I have been a fan of the Halloween series since I was a kid, however."

Goosebumps and The Shining are my first memories of horror, but Silent Hill and Pyramidhead are what solidified my love of the genre."

She didn't want to watch them alone but was worried about me watching them. She would set up toys in the front room in hopes it would distract me but eventually I just started watching the movies.

I was completely terrified to the point of having nightmares about it that still continue to this day, but at the same time, completely fascinated and almost obsessed with it. I've now probably seen the movie several hundred times and will always consider it my favorite movie ever.  Funny side note, my son, who is now 7, did the exact same thing when he was 5. I turned it on and quickly fell asleep, like I always do now when I watch a movie at night. My son snuck downstairs and watched the whole damn thing while I slept.

Parents had a nice collection of Stephen King books so stuff like It, The Dark Half, Cujo, Pet Semetary, and others were always staring down at me from high shelves.   I watched the Alien movies on VHS so many times the tapes wore out.  Worked in a library for a summer job and came across some old Arkham House hardcover collections of Lovecraft while putting books back. At this point Lovecraft didn't have the presence he has today; if you were mildly interested in popular horror fiction you had probably heard the name but that's probably as far as it went. Took The Dunwich Horror and Others home and stayed up all night reading it. That was the beginning of the end for me.

horror,3dgd1f,Banzai_Buckaroo,2,Thu Jul 16 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"One thing that I really do love about Shudder is the Shudder.TV channel -- just endless streaming of random content. As much as I love browsing huge libraries of movies, there's something nice and easy about having the channel make that choice for you. Half the time I spend on my Roku is probably just looking for the right movie to watch."
horror,3dgd1f,DoctorMystery,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:10:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see that appeal.
horror,3dgd1f,foundfootagefan,0,Thu Jul 16 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the point of this service. Real horror fans will always be dismayed by the selection that a streaming service has, even one devoted to horror."
horror,3dgd1f,DoctorMystery,3,Thu Jul 16 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, exactly. The kind of people who would sign up for an all-horror streaming service are likely the kind of people who have already seen most of (or at least a lot of) the available movies on Shudder, so I'm a bit skeptical. But I appreciate the idea of it, and really hope they can license the hell out of obscure, back-catalog titles to fill the roster and give the service at least as much value as Netflix/Hulu/Amazon."
horror,3dgd1f,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:07:14 2015 UTC,"They grab some of the same low-hanging-fruit that you can find elsewhere but they already have films I've not seen available on any streaming service at any time.  The ""kind of people who would"" sign up, I dunno, seems to me they'd be the kind of people that might listen to a song on the radio they already own or watch a movie on cable that they already own or go to a revival theater to see a beat-to-hell print of a film they have a pristine BD of in their collection.    Besides the anywhere convenience (especially when they're available on more smart devices) there is a different sort of psychological experience to happening upon something being available or already showing versus the process of browsing, selecting and playing a disc in a collection.  I typically play my discs if I absolutely want to watch something specific that isn't available on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and now Shudder or if someone is over and there's more pretense involved in playing specific films."
horror,3dgd1f,jedispyder,3,Thu Jul 16 14:45:46 2015 UTC,"I hate when people throw out ""real * fans"" because not every fan is the same. Horror itself is such a huge all-encompassing genre. I think Shudder has a good starting selection. I consider myself a huge horror fan and I'm please with the selection as there are a lot of films I've never heard of or haven't gotten around to watching yet. Sure, they don't have a lot of the top echelon of horror films yet that's likely because of the fact that it's too expensive to get streaming rights for a just starting out streaming service. They're adding stuff all the time, maybe eventually they'll get some but for now they have a decent start."
horror,3dgd1f,TheStaceyBeth,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, I like a fair amount of the selection that Shudder has.  They're constantly adding new content, too, so that's also a plus.  It's a lot better than what sites like Scream Box has to offer, tbh.  And as far as the site having films people have seen already, that doesn't seem like it'd be a huge issue, right?  If I like a movie, I want to watch it more than once."
horror,3dgd1f,jedispyder,3,Thu Jul 16 17:38:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, new content is pretty consistent with a few a week. For $5 it's not all that bad. I see a lot that I've never heard of and am eager to check out. Hopefully if it's started to get on devices I'll be able to download it onto my Vizio tv."
horror,3dgd1f,zombiemann,3,Thu Jul 16 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, have you actually browsed through the Shudder selection or are you just guessing? Also, what is your definition of a ""real horror fan""? I consider myself to be a faithful horror fan, and I've found plenty on Shudder that I haven't seen yet."

horror,3dejhv,on_rocket_falls,3,Thu Jul 16 14:03:19 2015 UTC,I watched Halloween on the big screen for a midnight showing with some people less versed in horror than I am. None of us got scared. Something about music cues was a little distracting. Im 22 by the way.

horror,3dejhv,nojloi,3,Wed Jul 15 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"No, not at all sadly. Enjoyable? Yes. Scary? No. The Exorcist isn't even scary anymore. It's nothing more than a thriller/mystery. These movies are dated and the thrills that once scared audiences have been copied again and again to the point that it's routine and clockwork. Nonetheless, Halloween is a monument."

horror,3dejhv,Sylar_Lives,2,Thu Jul 16 06:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's still a great movie, but at this point, probably a great 'ancestor' film. Everything that made the movie so good and so special has been ripped off so many thousands of times that I'd have a hard time imagining an audience of 20-somethings would get remotely the same impression as older audiences did when it was still fresh.   That's not a slight on the film (or filmmakers), but once an idea or a trope really stabs itself into pop culture, people get used to it, and often tired of it. Success, I guess, is a double-edged sword."

I was 12 and it freaked me the hell out, as I was home alone a lot back then, and lived in the country. I quickly fell in love with the genre, and as it was AMC's halloween marathon, I quickly watched several more classics over the weekend, such as Hellraiser, Friday the 13th Part 3 and 4, Pet Sematary, and Poltergeist. I'm proud to say that I've loved '70s and '80s horror ever since.  EDIT: I should mention that I spent the first 11 years of my life being extremely sheltered by my mother, who wouldn't even let me watch Cartoon Network. She gave up after my 11th birthday and I got be exposed to everything at once (movies, video games, etc) in all its glory, with no gradual exposure to lessen impact."

horror,3dg6oh,BeforeICringe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'd like to share my thoughts.  To be frank, I don't see this film turning out that well. Sure, it sounds like the director, Elias, is passionate about the project, as it's a perverted projection of his own wishes for his long-deceased sister to resurrect, but his own skillset cannot match the gravity of the concept. He's been in the industry for over two decades and yet, his best-known work is Gut, a one-note wonder with horrendous writing, hammy acting, depressing cinematography and technical aspects that freshmen JAMM students would lose hair from.  Believe me, the concept sounds decent and Elias seems like a dynamite dude on a personal level, but I don't expect much to come out of it.  Also, there's the behavioral patterns of the actors. Bill Oberst is one of the busiest actors in Hollywood because he accepts every role. He will always say the new one is the best, even if it's a complete lie. Same with Jennifer Lynn Warren, who has been in some truly horrendous movies, yet always will say things like, ""This is the best movie ever"". Considering how Gut turned out, her role will probably constitute abrupt scenes that don't lead anywhere where her nipples are bared, then a final scene where she walks out on her lover because he's ""living in the past and not the present"".  I hope this movie turns out well, but I don't see these peoples' track records bringing any semblance of confidence."
horror,3dd674,macgayyver,17,Wed Jul 15 10:02:28 2015 UTC,"Huge fan of the original trilogy, love each one for it's own special reasons.  With the revived interest in it thanks to the new tv series, I've noticed a lot of people feel that Scream hasn't stood the test of time, and that it's just no longer scary.  I completely disagree.  The masked killer formula is still pretty scary.  There's a lot of room for uncertainty, and the ""everyone's a suspect"" feeling really speaks to that basic young adult fear that your friends aren't really your friends.  It also says that you can't feel safe anywhere, from your own home to a quiet room at a crowded party."
horror,3dd674,ichabodguitar,17,Wed Jul 15 11:14:46 2015 UTC,"There are people who think that Scream hasn't stood the test of time? I'm so glad I don't know any of these people...  The screenplay is great, the acting's fantastic (Billy and Stu are insanely quotable, and most of that wasn't even scripted), the soundtrack kicks ass, and the cinematography is immersive. I have nothing but praise for this flick, and it's easily in my top 5 for horror. Then again, it did come out when I was in junior high, so my nostalgia for the time period may influence my appreciation."

I feel like ive seen every episode (I really havent) because every sitcom is just like it.   I love scream, but it does come across as campy ans cheesy at times for me, almost lole a scooby doo episode. The ""whats your favorite scary movie?"" Always makes me laugh.

horror,3dd674,macgayyver,8,Wed Jul 15 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"The campiness of scream is most certainly intentional.  Yes, it was intended to be a scary slasher film.  But it was also a total send up of slasher films.  Ghost Face's mast and costume, the dialogue, the characters themselves, all camptastic.  Think back to the girls in the bathroom talking about Sidney.  The way the brunette delivers the line about her ""bubble-butt boyfriend, billy.""  Or the scene where Dewey is holding up the mask in Sidney's door.  I mean, Jamie Kennedy is in this for god's sake."

I was so tense and terrified during the opening scene that I threw my back out from jumping out of my seat when the chair crashed through Casey Becker's window.  I also went in thinking Drew Barrymore ('90s hotness at the time) was the star, threw me for a loop!  I've seen it no less than 50 times since.  One of my all-time faves."
horror,3dd674,scorpiorising88,7,Wed Jul 15 14:01:54 2015 UTC,"The Scream franchise is by far my favorite horror franchise. I love the camp, the meta/self-referencing dialogue, the way the films played with classic tropes of the genre but were also fresh and edgy for their time. They're essentially the only films of their kind, that fully and solely explore a Whodunit? slasher mystery without any supernatural aspects and focus on a younger demographic. Or at least they're the only films to do it that I know of. Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. give us immediate backstory and a masked villain of super-human proportions; Scream did the opposite -- it built the story in reverse, forcing us to suspect all of the characters at one point or another (there was even a big part of the fan base pushing for Sidney to be the killer in the third film, which I think may be why they took the route they did in the fourth), and letting us only learn the truth in the ""final act."" And maybe even in that final act, as in the first film, you don't get the whole story. I know a lot of people criticized the third film, and the first two were definitely superior in writing and overall execution, but I did enjoy the Hollywood, gang-rape, spurned child backstory. Even if it was a little melodramatic. I guess you could argue that they're not exactly ""scary"" by today's standards, but they do pack a punch and have some of the more iconic death scenes in modern horror: Tatum's garage door mishap, for instance. The last things I'll say are just that I really enjoy the story's transgression from small town ""murderville"" (thank you, MTV) to sleepy college campus to the hills of Hollywood and the very synced up transformation of Sidney Prescott's character from each film. I think she's the best horror heroine we have so far.    I don't really mention the fourth film much because, even though they reassembled most of the actors/mechanics that made the franchise a success, it's the weakest installment because of tone and lack of imagination (especially the weak kills, IMO). I didn't mind the big reveal and actually think they did a good job towing that line so fans could get their good-girl-gone-bad appetite quenched but still retain Sidney as the sole survivor archetype."
horror,3dd674,DoinWhale,7,Wed Jul 15 23:29:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of the criticism I see is people talking about how it follows the cliches of any old horror slasher film. Hello? That was the entire point, this series is very self aware and always was meant to be that way: a commentary on the dying slasher genre. Lots of the newer kids watching it don't realize that this laid the groundwork and essentially revived the slasher genre. The cliches they criticize it for following were set by these movies in the first place.   I'll always love this series, and I'm thoroughly enjoying this new TV adaptation."

The driving force of me watching this was I had just come off a 12 day Friends marathon and the Courtney Cox connection was a good enough reason to warrant watching it.   Because it had been so long since I've seen it, I'd say I was about 11-13 the last time, quite a lot of what I remembered of Scream had been muddled in my head with Scary Movie. I was more than happy when I realised what had happened and I could sit and enjoy a movie I genuinely couldn't remember the plot of.   I liked it, and the sequels (to varying degrees). It's a refreshing move of Craven to set Scream in a world where horror movies actually exist. Characters point out the obvious tropes in a horror movie but falling into those situations themselves was a nice bit of comic relief for a movie that is neither serious nor a total comedy.   Well worth the time I spent with it."
horror,3dd674,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"It's a refreshing move of Craven to set Scream in a world where horror movies actually exist.   Really? He's actually repeating himself since his silly return to the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise two years prior was totally meta.  He followed this up with the abysmal Eddie Murphy vampire movie.  He was still in a comedic creative space but perhaps looking for material more like what had recently ""worked"" for him.  He had nothing to do with creating this world though, apart from perhaps giving the thumbs up on the costume bought for Ghost Face.   Coming across the Kevin Williamson scripts would have been a match made in heaven because Williamson doesn't really know how to be anything else (the antagonist in The Following basically has a copy-paste substitution of Edgar Allen Poe versus horror movies)."

The first death in the movie is a girl just wanting to watch a movie and make popcorn in a suburban house. Super normal.

Chick flick, right?  NOPE. Loved it. Totally didn't see the twist coming, though I do remember saying (right after the bathroom scene) ""This can't be the same stuntman. He looks taller than before."" No idea why I thought that.  We made sure to see the sequel together when it came out.  Third one, I'm glad I didn't see it with her. That movie sucks.  4th is only noteworthy to me because a lot of it was shot about 6 miles from where I'm typing this from. The wide shot of the downtown area?

I don't think they are particularly good, but they hold a place in my heart."
horror,3dd674,sigersen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"When I saw this in theaters I initially didn't like it.  Something about the dual killers bugged me but the more I thought about it the more I wanted to see it again, and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I ended up seeing it at least three times that Winter (if I recall, Scream played theaters during Christmas shopping season).    There's a tone and style in the two follow-up sequels that I liked, preserved from the original, but they're nowhere near as good and their very existence is a kind of ironic feedback loop.  I couldn't make it through the fourth and am going to pretend the TV show doesn't exist.  By becoming a franchise it became what it lampooned and fell victim to every sequel cliche, including ever increasing mediocrity.  The original though, it's a keeper.  And I'm so glad that my BD has the unrated opening like my laserdisc and unlike my DVD.  Kevin Williamson more or less proved to be a one-trick pony, in terms of self-referential style.  I was impressed he was able to make it so that not a single character in The Following was his typical alter-ego film buff but he continues to write characters that hopelessly keep repeating the same dumb decision making."

It looks like just another horror film made for mass audience appeal, piggybacking the success of other shitty horror films, like Paranormal Activity."
horror,3df7q1,scorpiorising88,3,Wed Jul 15 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"I actually found the first Paranormal Activity quite scary.  The second one had way too much ""why don't you believe me"" and was primarily about children.  The first one was scary because it was happening to adults and it didn't waste half of the movie revolving around them not believing each other.  The third was good but I didn't like the mythos they built with it.  I actually liked the fourth because it was a return to basics.  I never got around to watching the most recent one."

horror,3df7q1,BrianTheShark,3,Thu Jul 16 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"I was really disappointed in this film for two reasons:    It was all jump scares for me. I didn't feel any dread about the kids' situation or anything truly horrific.  Based on what I went into the theater knowing, I was expecting a slasher. The trailer compared Charlie to Freddy and Jason, so my thought was that this was going to be a modern slasher comparable to those franchises."
horror,3df7q1,BrianTheShark,3,Wed Jul 15 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the slasher marketing was a mistake.  Not only is it a supernatural horror film rather than a slasher, but a supernatural horror film is usually much scarier than a slasher film (especially a bad slasher film)."
horror,3df7q1,BrianTheShark,2,Wed Jul 15 21:26:42 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair assessment of their marketing. I can see a scenario where a marketing team recognizes these really popular franchises from back when and hopes to piggy back off of it. I certainly went because of those franchise mentions. They just didn't recognize that they weren't applicable.
horror,3df7q1,JMFIT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see that.  I actually didn't see any of the marketing blitz at all for some reason (I don't watch TV, but I'm not sure how I missed the online blitz), so my only exposure to it was the short trailer in a movie theater, the one that just shows her sitting there and getting grabbed by the noose (the same one that's embedded in my link).  THAT trailer effectively showcases what the movie is about, and I thought that trailer was scary as fuck."
horror,3df7q1,The_Toecutter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:16 2015 UTC,Fair. I didn't think the movie was awful. It was just disappointing that I didn't get what I expected. Totally was hoping for that nostalgia.

Avoid the American remakes... The Taking of Deborah Logan and The Babadook are some of my current favorites being streamed.

My nostalgic fave for Halloween theme is an old TV-movie called The Midnight Hour. It's not really scary -- it's more of a kids movie, overall -- but it gives me the warm fuzzies for the season, with zombies, vampires, and werewolves invading a small town. It's on YouTube. I have a DVD rip where the title screen is Return of the Living Zombies or something like that.  On the other hand, if you're interested in Halloween-themed television, HAVE I GOT A LIST FOR YOU. I spent a few months cataloging every horror- or Halloween-themed TV episode from 1952 to around 2005 or so, and put it all into a nice spreadsheet so I could collect them all. It's about a decade out of date now (and never truly 'complete' in the first place), but still a handy guide:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WjGz46Qvkyr0mZ9knTjZtaDD5z7MSAZjnhaRUPP2N_E/edit?usp=sharing"

I'd go with the original on this one. The remake had its moments, but IMO the original is a much better film.  IIRC Part 2 was decent as well.   Murder Party -- Pretty damn low budget, but the director definitely pulled an entertaining flick out of that tiny budget.   Satan's Little Helper -- Also seems pretty low budget. Not as awesome as the former, but watchable.   I feel like I'm still forgetting some crap...   Disney's Halloween Treat?  lol  (Come on, that one's a classic.)"

I'm relatively new here, hell I'm fairly new to reddit and I'm still young at 25. But this movie when I saw it 3 years ago literally had me paranoid. I couldn't sleep, nothing comforted me, even sleeping next to my then girlfriend help ease my mind.  The thought of just, ""If they want you, they'll take you. Doesn't matter how, they'll find a way."" always, always, always bothered me.   I can handle a lot of horror movies. I was terrified of Jaws, especially when I had an uncle who took me to Universal Studios and chatted me up the whole way into the line at the ride. He even got me to not pay attention to where we sat. Looking back, I thought we were going on a boat ride tour.   Anyway, you can tell where that's going.

horror,3dckx7,TheVeldt323,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned something about poor camera/focus & dull cinematography. I will have to disagree there with you there. We've only really seen about 3-4 mins worth of footage. The first thing that really catches my attention is the over saturation of color! Looks incredibly overwhelming. Its not everyday you get a horror film with such intense colors (immediately I think Suspiria). It gives me that feeling you get when you've been out in the sun too long and everything seems high contrast-y. Incredibly misleading: first there is GREEN, which is supposed to be very pastoral, invoking feelings of calmness and re-birth (how touché). Then the RED. This color can be appropriated to mean both positive and negative. Love & hate (or in this case danger). Two sides of the same coin. It plays beautifully with the surrounding greens. Especially since the villagers are wearing the color from head-to-toe. It's almost like the most fucked up Christmas donation special ever!  Another color scheme I noticed were the neon jumpsuits the protagonists wear. It makes them stick out like a sore thumb; they are the intruders here.  The airplane sequence is pretty chilling. I've been in those little planes (which honestly feels like you're riding a mosquito) and they do not feel safe at all. It definitely misleads the characters. The promise of going HOME and being back in your comfort zone must be appealing...and then I'm reminded of Lost a little with the crash. People getting sucked out, incredible shaky/blurry cam, etc.   Anyways, I know it will most definitely be all torture porn-y but thats what Roth IS! This is his niché, he does it incredibly well. I can't get too deep into camera work because I have yet to watch it, but it is clear he had a concrete vision. Also, I have not watched Cannibal Holocaust (which was the inspiration for this film, to the point where TGI was the original working title back then) but know it is infamous for its graphic content. I'm going to try & watch it before this release and see how it holds up!"
horror,3dckx7,Anichula,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:17 2015 UTC,"I know that it was likely a purposeful aesthetic but poor camera/focus work and dull cinematography do little to sell it to me that this supposed to feel ""real"".

The characters were bland, and while not as stupid or obnoxious as what we usually see in horror movies, I really didn't care about what happened to them at all. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie, since I live in Michigan, was recognizing some of the filming locations."

horror,3dbu9q,JohnHolowach,3,Wed Jul 15 01:35:02 2015 UTC,"Unlike regular audiobooks, this has a full cast, music, sound effects, etc.  My sound designer worked on one of the Medal of Honor games, as well.  Some more info:   A group of outlaws robs a train carrying gold bullion to a central bank.  During the heist, the young daughter of a wealthy businessman is killed, prompting him to send two skilled bounty hunters to bring them back to justice.  As their escape route is cut off by the hunters' posse, the outlaws are forced to take a dangerous path through the mountains, only to discover there's something else hunting them.   I've been working on this for over 2 years now, and I'm excited (and nervous) about it finally being done.  This is the first time I'm sharing anything about it with a general audience of strangers, so be kind, please. :)  The rest comes out on August 18."

horror,3d8p6x,turtlenecktrousers,8,Tue Jul 14 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I like horror shorts, but it makes it so much better when there is a cohesive story intertwined to connect all the madness. With 10 shorts in this one, it would be impressive if it turns out to be good. VHS had four stories to tell and the story that connected all of them fell short IMO."
horror,3d8p6x,XxDrRotzxX,5,Tue Jul 14 14:26:36 2015 UTC,VHS 2's story was a tad better.  3 was batshit crazy.

horror,3d8p6x,Zombie_Jesus_,2,Tue Jul 14 21:54:36 2015 UTC,I really hope it succeeds :) I think Creepshow and Cats Eyes do this fairly well. However now I come to think of it there really isnt another that achieves this to such effect as Trick R Treat.
horror,3d8p6x,turtlenecktrousers,3,Wed Jul 15 13:55:55 2015 UTC,"10 shorts in 2 hours makes them around 11 minutes long.  I could be afraid to sleep with the lights off from an 11 minute story.

The director of the film is the protagonist who answers a craigslist ad for videography work. The tension builds as the creep's stories don't add up and although there are some pretty lame jump scares, the team sort of pulls them off in a tongue and cheek sort of way that could be considered a finger point to the genre. The ending is what truly brings this story out of obscurity and is probably the reason for its success."

The dialogue was audible, the runtime was long enough to qualify as a feature length film, and the actors showed up on set.

I am pretty good about keeping the hype train to a minimum in my brain but you can't ignore everything  A lot of the hate feels a response to the hype.  Hell, the hype for It Follows did get to me. I still have problems with it, but I do think I would have enjoyed it so much more if I just randomly discovered it on Netflix.  The last movie I saw that lived up to the hype was Mad Max: Fury Road."
horror,3dcnfn,fedaykin13,2,Wed Jul 15 17:33:49 2015 UTC,"Agree 100 percent on the hype on both It Follows and Babadook, and much of the hate coming from that rather than the caliber of the movies. I still enjoyed It Follows a bit more as a horror movie... As for Pontypool, I really did like certain elements including the setup and Stephen McHattie, but I guess my baser instincts wanted it to play out to more of a climax than the Samuel Beckett play it turned into. Left a bit underwhelmed."

For me, it did the things right that a horror movie has to do right for me to really like it.   Not explain everything, supernatural vs not supernatural, show vs not show  I feel a lot of horror movies become bad when they don't do those things right. Sinister being a perfect example. Started great. It made a decision on one of those criteria and the movie fell apart fo rme."

It's not the same plot and it doesn't have the same characters aside from Annabelle (aside from the epilogue). Annabelle doesn't further the story of the Conjuring or it's main characters and vice versa. That's why it is a spin-off. It may be easier to understand if you read the Wikipedia page ""Spin-off (media)."" I would link, but I'm on mobile.   Edit: I stand semi-corrected.

This subjective reality is akin to a kid deciding to study archeology and then ""discovering"" some ""obscure"" item they see in a museum.  There is a difference between a film actually being obscure and the viewer simply being ignorant.  Something not being the most well known work to people who don't know the works of said directors is a reflection of how uninitiated that person is more than anything.  For instance, M is one of the most well known Fritz Lang films.  Lost Highway played fairly wide, had a good cable tv run and got a lot of extra exposure because of the murder investigation tied to Robert Blake.  It also got a lot of non-genre exposure because of the frequent nudity of Patricia Arquette.    The Brood has also been a heavy cable rotation title in the past, playing alongside Scanners, Videodrome and Rabid (a perhaps lesser appreciated film than The Brood, which is in the Criterion Collection), and prior to his finding true mainstream success and/or awareness with The Fly, Dead Ringers and Crash."

horror,3d8ki7,frostfromfire,2,Tue Jul 14 14:28:32 2015 UTC,Upvote for Versus. One of my favorite movies.
horror,3d8ki7,KennethGloeckler,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:45 2015 UTC,Zombieland could do the trick. Not really scary but it has the Zombie thing going. Good warm up for her IMO.
horror,3d8ki7,XxDrRotzxX,2,Wed Jul 15 00:52:19 2015 UTC,The Sixth Sense or Fire in the Sky.  They're unsettling & scary but don't rely on gore or jump scares.
horror,3d8ki7,lumpiestprincess,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"Cabin in the Woods is the worst film you could have shown her. It's a movie for horror lovers. You can't even appreciate half of it without an understanding of the genre.  It's very easy to introduce someone to horror. The new horror blockbusters are very watchable. That's why they are very successful at the box office I suppose.   It Follows was suggested before and is fantastic.   Paranormal Activity for the introduction into the recent-ish found footage trend. Ring, a classic that still holds up and has a very unique feel to it. You can't skip over a Zombie movie. Choosing one's not too easy. I'd personally go with Romero's Dawn of the Dead but it's definitely not a modern movie. The pacing is slower. The atmosphere is very intense. You have to know for yourself whether your friend could be receptive to it. Otherwise, go with the Dawn of the Dead remake or 28 Days Later.  I believe that the slasher and sci fi horror genre is dead today. You could go with an old movie but there are some people that simply can't enjoy them. If you think that she is up to it, then go with my favorite horror movie of all time. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It looks very outdated but it's as effective today as ever. For the Sci-Fi horror genre, you must include Alien and Aliens. Even if you don't care about horror a single bit, you must know these movies for its legacy.  Any of the ghost movies of today. There seem to be so many really. Insidious, Sinister. These movies shine when your friends enjoys to be scared. You said she was jumpy? Modern movies are great for that. There are some snobs that criticize jump scares but they generate adrenaline and for many that's the charm of horror movies."

Seems like a direct to DVD movie that tried to rip of Night Of The Living Dead and Reanimator at the same time. Missed badly at achieving either. Maybe slightly like the older NOTLD but not as good but with some bimbos and bad acting. Zombie scares were weak and disappointing.

horror,3d5mma,TheVeldt323,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:28:58 2015 UTC,I saw a lot of similarities - both are about young women who waitress for a living who end up rotting from the inside.   It even had similar shots like her having maggots inside her and bleeding from her crotch.   Totally different causes but similar symptoms.
horror,3d5mma,Rosenrot1791,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"It's mostly the symptoms. Like if you ignore the first 20-30 minutes of the movie, they are the same film. Girl slowly rots away, gets angry and friends including those helping, kills said friends, has maggots in crouch, dies."

I still haven't seen the reboot- I'm so attached to the original, I don't know if I can. It's just so gritty and so surreal and so violent without being gory at all. And the characters... well, they've got more dynamics than the typical slasher movie victims. The family that preys together, stays together, after all."

horror,3d6c06,MyUserNameTaken,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"Earlier this year, I finally watched The Human Centipede and The Human Centipede 2.   I'm not one of those people who use ""torture porn"" as an insult or look down their noses at ""shock value"". I'm a fan of torture and shock. I'm a fan of tastelessness and films that lack ""socially redeeming value"". The opportunity to wallow in sadism and depravity is a big part of horror's appeal for me. In other words, I wasn't avoiding these films for the reasons you might expect.  With part 1, I didn't realize beforehand how much plot it had or how suspenseful it would be. I expected something campier and simpler than what I ended up with.  With part 2, I had underestimated the quality of cinematography that could be achieved in black and white. That's really all there was to it. The premise and content was perfect for me, but I was turned off by the decision to film it in B&W."

I think a lot of people brush both of THC movies off a simply falling under those categories, but I thought they were both really well made, in their own ways.  I feel like a lot of the horror community tends to shy away from/look down on these sorts of movies, and I think it's a shame because a movie can be totally gruesome and vile and exploitive, and still be great."

There's a scene where a taxi stops by a small bridge and someone gets out and has a flashback to childhood, and there's also a scene where people who are in the sewers (which they get into from an area close to where the other scene is) find a small weird door that they go through."

Just great writing and unbeatable atmosphere. It does have a good number of scary parts, but it's not intended to be pants-wetting, if that's what you're looking for.  (But if you do get it, remember to download the unofficial patch which fixes all major bugs.)"

Cryostasis: Sleep of Reason is pretty cool too. Fantastic use of PhysX inside of a frozen ship in the Arctic. It's a nice setting for a change.   Oh and maybe have a look at the Penumbra series. Same devs as Amnesia."

horror,3d48sx,hengst2404,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, you don't need hundreds.   Short recommendation - I'd go for either the Sennheiser HD280pro Closed ($99) or the Sony MDR-7506 ($85) .   My gf's got the latter, and they're great, but I've had slightly dodgy experiences with them on SOME - not all - sound kit. I've got the former, and they're great - I have not a bad word to say.   The Sony ones are also absolutely industry standard anywhere where pro sound is required - film and recording industries - so you know they're good, not just good for the price."

horror,3d3gwz,rockosolido,3,Mon Jul 13 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"io9 actually had a great piece that sums up exactly how I feel about this show...  The Strain Is Fascinating, But for All the Wrong Reasons  ""I know that sounds like I’m being sarcastic, but I’m really not. This is a show that features an ancient, giant evil vampire with superpower with an army of mindless minions who have giant, blood-sucking tentacles in their mouths; a show where there’s a “good” order of vampires who fight the evil vampire and have an elite team of spec op ninja zombies; a show that features the wholesale murder of blind children so they’re turned into some kind of special psychic zombies or something; and somehow the show is boring.""  This show has so much going on, but between the incessant commercial breaks and terrible pacing, I can't force myself to stick to it. As a fan of the comics, I was looking forward to the series soon as it was announced. Then the casting news  started trickling out and my excitement doubled; I freaking love Corey Stoll, Sean Astin and Kevin Durand.   After an entire first season of essentially nothing happening between the first and last episode, nothing to move the plot forward, I was about ready to give up. We're introduced to the vampire threat, spend a season sitting on our hands, making absolutely zero progress towards any goal, and then we get a fantastic season finale. I told myself I'd give the second season two episodes to keep that pace and win me back but after the premier last night...I just don't think I'm interested enough anymore.  I don't know how this show managed to be so damned boring."
horror,3d3gwz,jjmayhem,5,Mon Jul 13 20:26:22 2015 UTC,I watched the first season and enjoyed it a lot.   Lately they always manage to cast really creepy great actors as nazi's in almost everything it seems.

I see you're shooting on RED and have most of the post-software already. Why not just shoot the short on your own dime (remember how shorts used to get made?) and THEN raise money for the feature you intend to make?   I love supporting indie horror but I'm always uneasy about financing people's experiments/shorts because it feels like asking to learn the process some more on other people's money. You don't need $3,500 to make a good short film. Borrow some C-stands, get a friend who does grip work, rent a lens with your own cash, etc..."

I have liked it a lot on the two episodes it has been on. I continue to wait for it to fall apart, as I do not see how it can maintain throughout an entire season, given the subject matter.

Maybe that's to be expected but I've never actually watched an MTV show before, but they seem to be keeping that to a minimum so far. Otherwise it's pretty interesting. The opening scene with the voice over on the lake was pretty chilling, the new mask is pretty badass, and the kills are pretty good."
horror,3d3yvo,gimp1124,3,Mon Jul 13 12:53:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's kinda douchey with the Dawson's creek type storyline. That said I'm still going to watch because I'm hard up for new horror lately.
horror,3d3yvo,jwilliamb24,5,Mon Jul 13 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Did you not like the Scream movies?  I am having a hard time understanding this type of opinion considering that Kevin Williamson - the creator of Dawson's Creek - wrote the screenplay for Scream 1, 2, and 4."
horror,3d3yvo,gimp1124,2,Mon Jul 13 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"You know what, you got me. I quickly picked a teen show to make a point about the douchiness of the teen drama part of the show and totally forgot he was involved with DC. Maybe it's because I'm 37 now and was 17 for scream/DC that I don't realize that the scream/DC kids were the same douchiness as these kids? Make sense?"
horror,3d3yvo,jwilliamb24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense. I assumed that much of that opinion comes from the age difference between when we first watched Scream in 1996 and now. But, what I do not understand is that some people in this sub expected something different from Scream the TV Series.   The TV Series is exactly what the TV Series is supposed to be."
horror,3d3yvo,gimp1124,2,Mon Jul 13 16:13:25 2015 UTC,Exactly. Someone who was in there 30s for scream in 96 probably thought those kids were douches too. I spoke too quickly.
horror,3d3yvo,InherentJest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"My problem is that Scream the tv series just copy and pasted Scream, instead of translating it into a tv show. Scream is mostly remembered as being a joke on the beaten to death slasher films. There is no abundance of slasher, or horror, tv shows for it to mock. Now Scream was also a mystery and there is an abundance of procedural cop shows that the t.v. series could have made fun of. Those often have ridiculous stories (Castle continually working with police) and archetype characters that could easily be turned up a notch to make a joke. Also, with the mystery aspect they could have a kill or so a week."
horror,3d3yvo,InherentJest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, Scream has the same story elements as a Dawson Creem type melodrama but it also does unique things with those moments (that scream the tv series does not). Like when Billy goes to see Sidney in the beginning of the movie. He sneaks into her room to talk about why they aren't sleeping together, something I imagine is common in teen dramas, but compares sleeping to her as seeing an R-rated Exorcist. It takes a stereotype moment and makes it sillier/jokier/more enjoyable. You could even compare the scenes in the movie and show where the characters are talking about what happened to the first girl who gets killed. In the movie, Stu and Randy deliver the lines in such an exaggerated way that even if they were serious (Stu makes a pun, so I doubt it)  they become a livelier moment. In the show, its taken more seriously which is the problem. The show hits the same beats as the movie without adding any fun to the moments like the movie did."
horror,3d3yvo,jwilliamb24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"Valid point, but the TV Series will fall short of your expectations if your expectations are too high. It's not as good as Scream (1996) and probably never will be. Williamson is not involved in the project in any capacity, and I think it was him that made the whole formula ""work""."

So far, I like how they're winking at the camera while making fun of themselves and the old 'horror movie rules' schtick and so far, it's been fairly gruesome for TV.   It's not re-defining the sub genre or anything, but so far I've found it fun and now that we see what  Scream TV Show looks like, it's good enough I'm curious of where they're going to go with it."

horror,3d3x34,x7he6uitar6uy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Illusion-O of article  13 Ghosts:       As with several of his more famous productions, Castle used a gimmick to promote the movie. For 13 Ghosts, audience members were given a choice: the ""brave"" ones could watch the film and see the ghosts, while the apprehensive among them would be able to opt out of the horror and watch without the stress of having to see the ghosts. The choice came via the special viewer, supposedly ""left by Dr. Zorba.""  In the theatres, scenes involving ghosts were shown in a ""process"" dubbed Illusion-O: the filmed elements of the actors and the sets — everything except the ghosts — were displayed in regular black-and-white, while the ghost elements were tinted a pale blue and superimposed over the frame. Audiences received viewers with red and blue cellophane filters. Choosing to look through the red filter intensified the images of the ghosts, while the blue filter ""removed"" them. Despite Castle's claims to the contrary, not many heart attacks or nervous breakdowns were averted by the Illusion-O process; although the blue filter did screen out the ghostly images, the ghosts were visible with the naked eye, without the red filter.  Because the ghosts were indeed viewable by the naked eye, the movie ran for years on television with no viewer needed to see the ghosts. DVD editions have varied in their preservation of the Illusion-O effect, with the latest DVD release including versions with and without the ghost outlines and a set of special viewers.

The trailer for Dark Skies freaked me out so much it actually gave me hives.  Sadly, the movie was laughable.  /u/khreper suggest The Fourth Kind.  And I agree for the most part.  There's some super intense moments that unfortunetly get drowned out over a convuluted plot.  A similar suggestion would be Communion.   Weird as fuck with about 30 seconds of the most terrfying stuff I've ever seen in my life from a movie."

The way they filmed it with two sets of actors to make one side of it look like a real documentary was very convincing and well done. I'll never look at owls the same way.

As Above So Below only barely, but the visuals and some of the mindfuck elements make it entertaining enough for a mild recommend (5.5/10). Babadook is a slow-burn with plenty of suspense and atmosphere, although a bit of a disappointing climax (7.5/10). Pumpkinhead has a decent amount of suspense as well, and awesome puppetry FX and design for the titular creature (7/10)."

The Canal has a really weird feel to it; of your list it got under my skin the most. I think that I may be the only person subbed to /r/horror that hated The Babadook. It's on a lot of people's top horror of the year lists so I think you'll really like it. As above, So Below is a great movie that I absolutely loved. Torment isn't really my type of horror but I think that Katherine Isabelle is the finest horror actress working today so it was well worth the watch. Pumpkinhead looks and feels like a classic creature feature and it has Lance Henriksen, so it's a must watch.   I haven't seen Exists but after reading the IMDB page I just rented it from Amazon and am going to watch it tonight. It looks fun and anytime I see something about bigfoot it reminds me of my favorite SCP."
horror,3d24v4,hengst2404,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"I also found As Above, So Below to be better than what others felt. It was intense and bizarre at parts and ultimately an interesting movie.   Babadook your mileage will vary. I was not super thrilled with it, but have decided I will give it another viewing soon. Hype hurts as always.  The Canal I actually liked and it will definitely mess with you a bit. It was a little uneven, but ultimately engaging."
horror,3d24v4,Trogpint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:01:31 2015 UTC,I had high hopes for Exists but it falls a little flat. There are better found footage movies out there. I personally liked Willow Creek better.

That's when it began to unsettle me. I passed up ""Babadook"" multiple times because Netflix rarely comes through for me with horror movies. I will say it definitely deserves a watch though! If you liked "" The Taking of Deborah Logan"", you may be interested in ""The Devil Inside"" (it's of the found-footage genre, plenty of jump scares and eerie demonic possession scenes)"

As Above, so Below should definitely be watched alone, no food/drinks, no pets around, at night, in a small room, phone off and thrown in the kitchen drawer. The great thing about it isn't really what is happening on screen, but what is implied. The sense of isolation, being trapped under tons of dirt and concrete, etc.  For movies like The Taking of Deborah Logan, I'm not really sure what aspect you are trying to find similarities in. Found footage? Grave Encounters had a similar vibe IMO. For The Descent, it might be a stretch but I really liked Pandorum. Completely different setting and its more like Alien, but still a cool movie that focuses on isolation with looming monsters."

While it definitely has horror elements, it lacks a lot of the substance you'd usually use to define the genre, and by that I don't mean 'cheap scares' and the like so much as a focus on the actual horror of the film.  If viewed as a horror flick, I think The Orphanage falls because of its two first acts, which serve as character-building more than anything, but viewed as what it really is, a tragedy, it works perfectly."

horror,3d2hi4,party_squad,2,Mon Jul 13 00:55:55 2015 UTC,"My memory is the unrated version has a few extra shots, along with some lengthened scenes. For instance, I think they hold for longer on a fake dead dog. While I usually go with the theatrical release first, in this case you've seen it so why not check out the uncut version?  Re: unnecessarily gory: Sometimes the unrated version is the first version the director sends to the mpaa, which the mpaa sends back with an nc-17. The director cuts a few shots and shortens some scenes on the next submission, scaling it back more to their vision anyway, and then picks up the R.   So some ""uncut"" versions are just that--you get a little unnecessary gore, maybe a prosthetic is held in the frame too long and starts looking ridiculous, etc."

Personally, I thought it was ballsy and pretty good but a lot of people didn't like the fact that a certain character did not return and I'll just leave it at that in case you ever watch it. Alien Resurrection is garbage, steer clear of this one. Trust me.  I would love to tell you how AvP 2 was, but I literally could not comprehend what was going on onscreen. The whole movie has this strange dark filter to it that makes it almost impossible to see what's going on throughout the movie. At least that's what I remember. The story is pretty shit anyways and there are no likable characters, just avoid it.

It's really different visually, though.  Not as dark. I hated the AvP movies.  The first one I felt was a really misguided attempt at a PG-13 franchise, and then they overcompensated in Requiem and it felt like they were trying to make it gory and extreme to point of being silly.

Say he wakes up in a room, sees a box in the middle of the ground. Looks inside and it's the Jigsaw mask and it says ""want to play a game"".   Movie is then about Morgan Freeman trying to find him after he went missing. I mean if we're talking mixing films, Saw and Se7en is actually a good mix.  Directed by David Fincher for maximum effect."

I think 7 had a bunch of really good ideas that they didn't use, though. I've considering making a fan version of it, but I dunno."
horror,3cvc74,PrayerRequest1,2,Sun Jul 12 23:32:08 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, the first one had a relatively deep and well done story, but after the second I just started watching them for the gore honestly. The stories were OKAY at best (Though I fucking HATED Hoffman and hated how long they stuck with him), but they were always just dumb entertainment in my book :) Like I said, nothing great, or good even, but they were dumb fun to me :)"
horror,3cvc74,wesjall,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"Fair 'nuff. I liked the first for the story; the second for the cleverness and scariness of the house scene. The third, I liked a lot of the story, but I also felt the pacing between the Kramer scenes and the Jeff scenes was kinda weird. I understand why they went the route they went and can't say I can think of a better one, though. The 4th was good but the reveal that it took part at the time of the 3rd felt kinda odd. The 5th and 6th are definitely best viewed the way you say they are; otherwise, the time spent between the main traps and Hoffman's stuff going on feels really weird. If it's viewed as dumb entertainment, the Hoffman stuff is just distracting. If it's viewed seriously, the main traps are too distracting. :P  I felt 7 would have been a GREAT film if they had spent less time on the main trap and more time on the public traps, the Gordon thing (while I like the last-second twist, it could've made for a great full film), and the Jigsaw support group with MAYBE a cult of Jigsaw survivors who believe that he actually changed them and are determined to continue his tests. Not too serious but not too off course either.  But yeah, I agree that the later ones are best viewed as dumb entertainment since the stories were kinda split-up in two and, as you said, Hoffman could've been characterized a lot better. I feel with 3 combined with 4 (with the Jeff storyline shortened or the film length extended), 5 and 6 ignored, and 7 changed, the sequels could be more than just dumb fun and actually have a great plot near the length of the original, with maybe some scares on the level of the second (MAYBE).  But yeah, I rambled way too long, sorry about that. Horror films are kinda the thing I can talk about all day xD"

horror,3cvc74,ArchDucky,14,Sat Jul 11 02:34:05 2015 UTC,I read some article where they said that army of darkness was kinda cannon but also not cannon. It was confusing.
horror,3cvc74,damonstien,11,Sat Jul 11 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Army of Darkness is canon but they just won't really be referring to it. Keeping it simple. The less exposition for new viewers, the better."
horror,3cvc74,DocWheatley,6,Sat Jul 11 04:01:59 2015 UTC,My guess is it's a rights issue with Universal.
horror,3cvc74,demonovation,13,Sat Jul 11 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right. I own the Army of Darkness roleplaying game, and the first chapter explains that due to copywrite law, they can only reference events that happened directly in Army of Darkness. So if it was shown in the back story at the start of the film, it's fair game. It looks like this is the reverse of that."
horror,3cvc74,Brofose,5,Sat Jul 11 05:11:44 2015 UTC,TIL there's an Army of Darkness roleplaying game. Is it on par with something like D&D? Or simpler or more complex?
horror,3cvc74,balanceofpower,8,Sat Jul 11 07:41:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely simpler. It's been a few years since I pawed through it, but iirc the idea behind it is that the GM is the ""director"" of a ""movie,"" and the players are actors. Each session is an episode, and each story arc is a season. It's meant to be played around the rule of cool, meaning if something a player comes up with sounds awesome, just go for it. I think there's actually points that each player can use per session to take control of a situation from the GM and twist what really happened.  For instance, in Army of Darkness, when Ash is in the pit fighting a Deadite and losing, the player would have used a point to take control of the scene and have someone toss him the chainsaw while jumping into the air and having it attach perfectly to his stump in order to gain advantage during the fight.  I can't remember any of the actual combat mechanics other than being d20 based, but I can take a look and some pictures in a few hours when I'm out of work if you or anyone else cares enough. Picked it up in '06 or '07, never actually played it."
horror,3cvc74,Brofose,2,Sat Jul 11 08:14:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quick reply. I would welcome pics as long as I'm not putting you out.  That sounds like an awesome game. Now if only I had friends to play it with .___.

horror,3cvc74,ARTNK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"While I recommend watching the original trilogy, if you really want to catch up with Ash vs. Evil Dead, you should watch Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness (in that order). Evil Dead II is a blend of splatter/slapstick horror, while Army of Darkness borders on comedy/horror and really fleshes out Ash as the cynical, albeit resourceful, antihero we've grown to love.   Edit: I should also mention that Evil Dead II is essentially a remake of Evil Dead, though with a larger budget. That's why it's not essential to see Evil Dead to understand Ash's journey and character development."

horror,3czwn1,wendysNO1wcheese,2,Sun Jul 12 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting for sure.  A lot of the violence was unnerving, probably because of the perspective.  Definitely elevated compared to the original.  I don't even know that I liked it as much as loved what they were accomplishing, if that makes sense.  It's great to see a horror movie that's trying to do something artistic instead of just fill seats."
horror,3czwn1,8bit_Llama,2,Sun Jul 12 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not advocating horror remakes, but if a studio has to do it then this is how it should be done. Maniac is a fantastic movie, and not just because I love Elijah Wood in these sort of roles. The POV didn't feel at all like the gimmick I was expecting and reminded me a lot of the beginning of Halloween. Also, the murders were carried out with such brutality - the movie was both psychologically and visually disturbing whereas with most remakes you're lucky if you get one.  Whenever people say that the slasher movie is dead I recommend this one. It's an innovative and takes the genre to new levels. I really hope that filmmakers learn from Maniac."

The art style can take a bit of getting used to but overall I enjoyed it. Each episode follows a different urban legend or Japanese folktale focusing on the occult.  Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (and Kai) is pretty good. A bit of a mind fuck and you have to watch all the way through to really figure out why everything is happening but it has some genuinely creepy moments to it. Don't watch the dub though, the voices are trash and the second season isn't dubbed yet anyway.  On a sidenote: Corpse Party the anime was a disappointment but the game is pretty good. If you ever want to watch the anime, I recommend playing the game first."

horror,3cxyxj,asleeponthesun,2,Sun Jul 12 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"Genocyber (1993), a classic. It is a lysergic bad trip of gore, sci-fi inspired. Urotsukidoji (1989), a bloody mess! What can I say, I love old anime, specially between the lines of gore and science fiction. The bloodier the better. Both are incredibly visual, old, but they have that peculiar vintage taste.  More recently, besides great recommendations already done, I'm getting Zankyou no Terror, a thriller about a mysterious terrorist attack in Tokyo. And, I've just watched Strait Jacket, it's great! Action + Horror + Gore without any rest and it has just 3 episodes.  Oh, the Aoi Bungaku Series is good, dense and malicious, if you are into psychological drama and nightmarish suspense, this one deserves a shot. Shigurui: Death Frenzy is macabre and sadistic, almost vile. Imagine if the Marquis de Sade had written a drama about samurais during 1629 in Japan.  ""Horror"" is quite a frail genre in anime. This is my best try."

That has literally been their formula for the last 50 years. Stepping away from low budget would be a bit revolutionary, but it seems to totally not be worth it for horror.   I remember one of the trends that Scream started was it was one of the few times a horror movie spent money on have a cast audiences would recognize."

But what he's doing is something that extremely few studios are doing these days: He gives those working for him a budget and unlimited creative freedom to make their horror film.   That's going to produce a lot more interesting horror flick than the PG-13, big budget, demographically designed snoozefests the big Hollywood studios are putting out.

Films like The Conjuring and Evil Dead are some of the few that have been made in the past 5 years for over $5mil. A lot of horror films are made at $5mil or less. The $5mil horror film is one of the most consistently profitable film models and Jason Blum isn't doing anything really unique.

horror,3cz6xs,omnilynx,7,Sun Jul 12 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not Aaron Moorehead, but as a fellow cinematographer who came up in the same year's festivals with The Battery, I will weigh in. Looking at both Resolution and The Battery, it is clear that these rules for success apply:   Make a bromance.    And that's it.   But in all seriousness, I think Justin and Aaron would agree that you should simply set out to make a movie. Don't think of it in terms of horror or any other genre, just try to make the best thing you can within your means. You could argue that both of the films mentioned above are closer to drama and comedy than ""horror"".  We cut our teeth by watching tons of DVD special features and listening to tons of audio commentaries. There are great special features on Justin and Aaron's discs for Resolution and Spring, especially Spring. The Battery disc has a 90 minute documentary outlining exactly how we did every aspect of production. If anyone wants to watch it, send me a message for a Dropbox link. We spent close to a year on it, specifically to help aspiring filmmakers.   Mostly, prepare to suffer and scrape together all of your pennies to make the movie, and then steal your neighbor's pennies to get to film festivals, and then make pennies upon release. It is a very good idea to have a very flexible and stable source of income to back up your movie ""career"" and keep the ship afloat. I know Justin and Aaron do some production work because they have real film talents. I am a food photographer. Right now I am shooting  a ton of cookies and things so I can take a few months off to promote our second movie until I'm broke and need to shoot more cookies."

horror,3cz6xs,AaronMoorhead,5,Mon Jul 13 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"HEY! Thanks for coming to the panel. That was a bit crazy and terrifying...there were a lot of people in that room, and a lot of people I love and respect sitting next to us on the panel too.  I will try to not tread back over what /u/ChristianStella said, because everything he says especially re genre is how /u/justin_benson and I feel too.  Don't wait for someone to do it for you. No one will give you money unproven, so just accept that and move into actually making a movie. Can't find a good writer? Get good at writing and write it. Can't pay for a DP? Become one. Can't afford lights? Write to shoot during the day and get some reflectors. This isn't advice for how to achieve your perfect artistic vision in some sort of impenetrable bubble where you actually have control over every aspect of production -- that may (or may not) come later. Right now this is just advice for how to go make a movie and actually get to have made it.  Also, when it comes specifically to horror movies, be really careful with your budget when it comes to practical FX (gore, creatures, etc). To do them right you probably need, well, way more than you have. Every time I look at a budget and see the line item for SFX I wanna die, either because it's too low and I know it needs to go higher, or it's right where it needs to be and it's an insanely high percentage of the budget. Find a way to not do them if you can't do them right.  That's all I got for now, but I'm around on my lurker account a lot more than this one. Love you guys."

It's starts off with a moody teenager and then ramps up the creep factor. The performances Byrne gets out of these teens is brilliant. Robin McLeavy especially plays a genuinely disturbed character, a ""Princess"", whose relationship with her father is another part of why this movie is disturbing.   I think this really works well on two levels. First, it's a solid horror movie and is definitely date night material. Second you can feel where Lola comes from in a way.

horror,3cwemo,Khnagar,3,Sat Jul 11 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"Fantastic film!  I sat down to watch it not knowing much about it, and holy fuck what a gloriously twisted, funny and gory film it was. Very dark humour obviously, some nice twists and an original story, and a nice mix of the teen/horror genres.   No spoilers, but if I went on a date with a woman and she told me I was ""just another frog"" and pulls out a drill I'm running the fuck out of there."
horror,3cwemo,girlsjiggle,3,Sat Jul 11 12:26:57 2015 UTC,This is a great little film that obviously owes a lot to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with its kidnapping macabre family dinner scene. I was worried it was going to be torture porn and even though there is a bit of that its much more varied. Interesting factoid: The Loved Ones was an aussie band who had a hit with The Loved One later covered by INXS.

I'm not entirely sure all the scenes with the policeman's daughter were necessary though. I guess I get why they were there but it seemed like they could have expedited that bit."

The first 5-10 minutes play things out like an angsty teenage slasher-type film, but as it progresses, you find it to be something far better and freakier than that. As far as horror goes, it's extremely satisfying; a lot of horror films aren't ""crowd-pleasers,"" if you know what I mean. They rip your guts out and fling them in your face and leave you wondering what just happened. Not The Loved Ones. It gave me exactly what I wanted and left me smiling. (Good horror makes me smile, I guess that's kinda weird.)"

He tore it off with three rips a la dook dook dook.

On screen the prehistoric tiger was stock footage of a regular tiger except for close ups, when it was a stuffed animal with big teeth attached!  Besides that, this was nothing special.   That was all for horror movies for me this week, though I did watch Mad Max (1979)  and The Road Warrior (1981) for the first time since I was a teenager.  Well the first one is good, but man, the Road Warrior has got to be the best post-apocalyptic action film of all time....arguably, until the latest Mad Max entry.  Regardless, a rare case where the sequel outshines the original."

Even with a movie like As above so Below (Which I enjoyed), I felt like they did a really cheesy job with what could have been a great opportunity to delve into the plethora of myths surrounding hell. My biggest worry about this film is that now that the monster is known the movie will lose some of the fear of the unknown that drove the first one.

The dialogue and acting leave a bit to be desired, and it's fairly campy for when it came out, but if you ask me, there's two reasons people don't like it:   It was so different from Blair Witch 1. Obviously, this can be a big turn-off for people expecting another found-footage horror movie; I feel like the movie would have done better if it were released as a standalone movie with its own fictional mythos. Most people didn't ""get"" the ending. I mean that as honestly as possible. It's very easy to miss the single line of dialogue that sets up the entire ending, and if you miss that, the ending is probably going to seem like a nonsensical, cheap cop-out more than anything else. But if you ""get"" it, if you caught the right clues, it actually has an incredibly clever twist."
horror,3ct8o2,nderhjs,2,Fri Jul 10 22:12:59 2015 UTC,Please explain the ending for me!
horror,3ct8o2,UltimaGabe,13,Sat Jul 11 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"So, as you recall, there's a bunch of things in the movie that don't quite add up: For example, we see a giant tree in the middle of the Rustin Parr house ruins, despite the fact that there couldn't have been one- later on, while watching the footage the group recorded, the tree is a tiny sapling. When Kim goes to the store, she argues with the clerk, grabs her nail file and slamming it down, but leaves after throwing money on the counter, finding the nail file in her bag with blood on it- but the security camera footage we see shows her stabbing the clerk with the nail file. We also see some security camera footage of Jeff dragging Erica's body into the closet, and when Tristen gets pushed off the balcony, we see her possessed (and provoking the altercation) while the camera trained on her shows her as pleading for her life. We also see video camera footage of the entire group performing some sort of a ritual in the Parr ruins, despite the fact that none of them remember this.  Early in the movie, while the group is partying, Jeff is going on about how he wants to make a documentary about Kim (after unsuccessfully pitching such an idea to Erica). He says he wants to shoot the entire thing in video- because, according to him, ""Video never lies. Film does, though.""  That line, right there, while subtle and seemingly throw-away, sets up the explanation at the end of the movie. Because get this: We're watching a film. Therefore, anything we see happening before us isn't necessarily happening- the film could very well be lying to us. The only time when we can be sure we're seeing the truth is when we're watching a video recording- the security camera footage, the cameras watching the ruins, and so on. While of course this doesn't explain exactly why the group seems to go crazy and murderous, that's not really necessary within the scope of the movie. It could have been something in the drugs they were doing, it could have been temporary mental illness (remember- Jeff, Stephen, and Kim had all had previous mental health issues), it could have been the Blair Witch- it's left a mystery- but it shows us that what we've been watching has been all one big lie. It's a big reminder to the audience that you can't trust everything you see in movies (bringing us full circle with the Blair Witch Project and the media surrounding it) and that the truth may not be what you expect.  Like I said, the movie has some issues, but I think it's far, far greater and smarter than people give it credit for. They just see that it wasn't the same format as the first, and it was a bit campy, and they toss it at the top of every single ""worst sequels"" list."

We wouldn't have had it any other way... we'd rather have a percentage of people love what we did than everyone find it simply ""good enough"".   It is by no means a perfect movie, especially from a technical standpoint (my fault) but it was damn fun to put in a few hundred dollars each and make what we wanted... Then get a reaction out of so many people.   Right now, we're trying to figure out how to release our second film, Tex Montana Will Survive! It is even smaller.

It captured the quiet moments in between the horror so well. The only other zombie film to do that for me was 28 Days Later.

The Battery basically made enough to pay off the trips to film festivals we made to promote The Battery. Ha."
horror,3cv45q,ChristianStella,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I learned that in festivals/reviews. As long as the shots are effective, people can look past the camera only shooting about 780p of detail, or not having smooth whites (the sky blows out to pure white). In general, bad audio is far more distracting. The scene with Annie taking the car keys is a perfect example. The rain blew our audio equipment and we spent hours trying to fix it or get a replacement. Finally, it was getting dark so I had to just roll with the terrible microphone in the camera. But it got dark super fast and water had seeped into the camera lens. So I was not only shooting without any light, but through a haze of water. I spent months trying to fix that footage (you should see the original shots). I also spent weeks on that audio. We couldn't reshoot as the car had been sold for scrap after it died a few days later. I actually got the audio in that scene to where I'm mostly happy, but the picture makes me cringe (especially after the Jerry scene, which I love the shooting of). The only comments I've seen on the scene are audio related though, reinforcing that bad audio pulls you out of a movie far more than picture.   It's funny that our next movie is this quick little found footage comedy. Even though it is found footage, it is in the guise of a TV show, and, on a technical level, my camera and sound work is FAR superior to The Battery, with a better camera too... But few will notice."

I was shocked he could be that creepy, since I was kind of just expecting a weird version of Pete from The League, but he did an amazing job with just his eyes and his mannerisms (example: super weird high five).  Christian Bale said that when he was preparing for his role in ""American Psycho"" he based some of his performance off of Tom Cruise's interviews, bc Tom Cruise was very energetic and friendly but with ""nothing behind the eyes.""

It just felt silly.........(a la The Happening and the trees)"

The cinematography, framing, angles, sets, etc are all beautiful. A true art horror."

For example, https://www.youtube.com/user/marblehornets is better in quality overall (although it really picks up about halfway through) than many, many horror films released nowadays. It is, in my opinion, the best work in Found Footage ever.  Another good one is https://www.youtube.com/user/HandprintsoftheDead It has an actual plot built around more than cheap scares and creates it's own creative, unique, interesting mythology."
horror,3cp4s1,Willravel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'd absolutely agree. Sometimes it can be used by the filmmaker as a necessary ingredient in a great recipe. The problem is that some filmmakers treat it like MSG: a quick way to add shallow flavor. I'm afraid The Gallows is the latter, and has joined a growing group of films merely to use found footage as a gimmick.   It's a shame, really, because it can really make a film better, and the more movies to use it like a gimmick, the less will feel like using it well.   I really liked it in Chronicle."

I've never watched a found footage movie where I thought that the film could not have been done any other way. Oddly enough, I don't have this problem with mockumentaries."

I'm not entirely sure why one bothers me and the other doesn't. Maybe it's because the structure of a documentary explains a lot of the plot holes that found footage struggles with, such as why people are filming something when they should be running for their lives or why certain shots look way too competent to have been shot on the fly by someone with little to no filmmaking experience.  There are probably found footage movies where the gimmick is justified, though I haven't seen them. I'll also admit that this probably has a lot to do with the fact that I don't like the aesthetic of found footage, so it takes me a bit to look past my own prejudices against the genre.

Though every now and then, you run into a found footage movie with surprisingly polished cinematography. Not great or even necessarily good, but polished enough that it's clear that someone spent time thinking about framing to a degree where it takes you out of the movie.

horror,3cp4s1,WangChi,6,Thu Jul 9 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I saw it on Monday and didn't think it was as bad as most reviews are making it sound. That said, I completely disagree with Bloody Disgusting's 4 out of 5 rating. It's a mediocre found footage flick at best. Nothing more, nothing less."
horror,3cp4s1,Yeah_Okay_Sure,0,Thu Jul 9 22:48:39 2015 UTC,Were you at the downtown San Diego screening? I was the one who started the laughing fits near the end.
horror,3cp4s1,papamajama,3,Thu Jul 9 20:26:14 2015 UTC,Haha unfortunately no. I do quality checks on movie hard drives to make sure they work. I wish I was in San Diego. But I can understand the laughing having seen it (if it was indeed a reaction to what was going on).
horror,3cp4s1,There-Wolf,3,Thu Jul 9 20:32:14 2015 UTC,I heard about it only because I left the tv on and overheard Kathie Lee Gifford on the Today show  talk about her daughter starring in it.  This was a dead giveaway that it would bad.
horror,3cp4s1,MasqueRaccoon,3,Thu Jul 9 22:29:42 2015 UTC,If I can make it through unfriended and the fourth paranormal activity unscathed I think I'll be fine going to see The Gallows. It's not like I have anything better to do on a Friday - seeing a possibly crappy horror movie with my best friend sounds like a blast really.
horror,3cp4s1,TheJoshider10,3,Thu Jul 9 23:01:35 2015 UTC,What kills me is that the premise sounds pretty good: a hangman-style supernatural killer in a school. But the found footage genre has really gone downhill and the previews didn't show me anything to make it seem special.
horror,3cp4s1,predalien33,3,Thu Jul 9 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"The teaser trailer shat me up, I love found footage and jump scares always scare me. So i'll see it."

They just re-hased the Paranormal Activity trailer where they showed the audiences reactions AKA a bunch of teenage girls gasping at jump scares. Then we find out it yet another found footage flick, which leaves me and plenty of other horror fans to believe its sub-par, low budget spoopy movie taped on DV with a handful of jump scares... no more startling than a loud alarm clock going off at 6am.   ...then again it might make millions in profit so what the fuck do i know!?"

horror,3cp4s1,alucidexit,2,Sat Jul 11 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I was pretty excited to see this one. Mostly because I was unaware of the plot, and there aren't enough Horror films in theaters. Now that I know it's a ""found footage"" film I'm not sure I want to fork out the cash... I do find it incredibly sad, the lack of decent horror films that make it to theaters. I'm still up for giving this one a watch, cause admittedly I'm a sucker for high school horror stories. I feel as though I haven't seen many horror films with a solid, creative story line in awhile. I did enjoy ""It Follows"" mostly for the strange atmosphere. Any recommendations on recent horror films, Dreadit?"
horror,3cp4s1,jabracoroni,2,Fri Jul 10 03:07:57 2015 UTC,"Huh -- maybe they changed a lot, but I went to a test screening and I enjoyed The Gallows (this coming from someone who thought Oculus was dumb, and Babadook was OK... I know, sue me).   Sure, it's got dumb teenage horror written all over it, but it has a hell of a lot more plot than fucking Paranormal Activity.   The Gallows wasn't groundbreaking by any means but it was still more entertaining than most horror films I saw. That being said, what I saw was a test screening over almost a year ago, so they could have changed a lot."

horror,3cp4s1,EggMcMaggot,2,Fri Jul 10 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"I had a family come into my theater last night, a mom, two preteen kids and a 7ish year old daughter. I expected them to be going to see Minions, but when I looked at their tickets, I saw that they were going to see The Gallows. I immediately knew that they weren't going to make it through the movie. The lady actually came out about 20 later, which was still about 15 minutes before the movie started, asking for a refund because her young daughter was scared and she had to take her home. She looked really annoyed that her daughter wouldn't sit through the movie. Who brings a 7 year old to a horror movie.   I'll probably still see this movie, just because I get in for free. I would not pay to see this, but the only thing I'll lose is the 81 minutes that I could have been spending doing something else."

I am a huge fan of both. Are the PA movies perfect horror? No. But what is? Everyone has such a different opinion on what true horror is, we will never all agree. I hate gore movies, often called gorror, but I respect them for what they are. I enjoy scary horror, not bloody gross horror. A movie that terrifies me, leaves me feeling vulnerable, and that leaves me jumpy after are what I look for. I hate movies that seek only to make me sick with gore. But I know people love those movies, otherwise we never would have gotten as many Saw movies. But to call Saw terrible because it wasn't what I looked for in horror, is wrong. The same with people angry with FF or movies like PA."

horror,3cp4s1,nohitter21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"Don't be hating on Blum for this.  The filmmakers are two completely unknowns who spent four years working to the horror film, in their spare time more or less, with a tiny amount of money from local investors. Blum and his company saw the footage and thought it was good enough for a wider release. They reshot a handful of scenes with a bigger budget, raising the total cost of the film to 100,000 dollars.  The Gallows is basically the tiniest of tiny indie production, made by newcomers in the film industry, and it's rated R.  Most of the time those films are shit, and this one might very well be as well, but at the same time that's the sort of horror films that traditionally have been groundbreaking and concidered classics after a few years."
horror,3cp4s1,Khnagar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:11:58 2015 UTC,"Why exactly should we not blame Blum for that then? He's the one who thought it was good enough for a wide release, right?"
horror,3cp4s1,nohitter21,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:41 2015 UTC,"I said don't hate on Blum, not that he's not responsible for bringing this to a much wider audience.  I find it odd that people are complaining that a tiny budgeted, indie horror flick from a first time director is getting a wide theatrical release. Would you rather not have horror films made and marketed instead?"
horror,3cp4s1,Khnagar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:15:39 2015 UTC,"But the reason that people are hating on him is because it's a bad movie that he (presumably) personally chose to distribute nationally.   I find it odd that people are complaining that a tiny budgeted, indie horror flick from a first time director is getting a wide theatrical release. Would you rather not have horror films made and marketed instead?   I don't even know what you're saying with this honestly. I'm not complaining that it was released theatrically; i'm complaining that it sucked. There are plenty of first-time directors who do extremely well, like Benson and Moorehead with Resolution, so that's not an excuse for a bad movie."
horror,3cp4s1,TeenIdol12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:19:13 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying.  My point is the alternative to this film not getting distribution would not have been another horror film appearing out of the blue, it would have been one less horror film at the cinema.   I'm all for horror films at the cinema, and regardless of genre there's always going to be a few duds for every gem. Without distributors promoting horror and taking chances on films there's never going to be a breakout horror hit at the cinema."

horror,3cp4s1,Gonzo1888,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"It's sort of funny to see how people enjoyed a movie like It Follows but not something trope-y like this movie. I think some of the people criticizing this movie are going into it expecting more out of it than it ever could offer, it's a simple story just as Oculus, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, etc were. This article especially tries to pin such minor things against it like that the characters keep the first names of the actual actors, or that the cameraman manages to capture everything somehow.   It's produced by Blumhouse, who have produced Insidious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity and a few other films that were at least worth the $12 bucks. It's obviously something that's going to be more relatable to the teenagers, but hey - it's literally the only horror movie in the cinema right now besides Insidious Chapter 3 that came out a month ago."

The restraint West has with the ""scary jump"" moments make them all the scarier.  I still need to watch The Sacrament."
horror,3cs6u7,Casual_Grievance,2,Fri Jul 10 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"I think people's feelings on the The Sacrament, because of its obvious historical inspiration, can probably go either way when they watch it. Because you know what's going to happen (even more clearly than what you know about the plot in HotD), you're either going to be really bored, because you know how the movie is going to play out, or you'll enjoy the mounting tension as the storyline progresses to the inevitable shitstorm you know is coming.    Either way, I'd recommend it. I quite enjoyed how well West nailed the cultish atmosphere - plus it's got West's usual microbudget cinema collaborators AJ Bowen and Joe Swanberg in lead roles (which I guess could be a downside for some people, but, whatever)."

When I first read the Candle Cove creepypasta I totally thought it was real and I started researching it...    Either way a lot of creepypasta's have some great ideas and concepts that I'd like to see realized on the small screen.

horror,3cr71u,Cmckendry,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:21:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure what the appropriate length would be if you're adapting any of the famous creepypasta stories to TV/film. I think fundamentally there will be some challenges fitting different stories into one format, since some of them carry a mythology that could easily span an entire season, but many of the most well-loved really rely on a ""WHAT A TWEEEST"" format, and would be stretched pretty thin if they go past about the 5-minute mark. I'm having a difficult time imagining what the third hour of a Candle Cove story would look like.  And setting aside the creepypasta angle, I'm pretty skeptical about any anthology show lasting very long in the age of internet video, and ""horror TV"" is a pretty tough nut to crack under the best of circumstances.  Having said all of that, I'm actually pretty interested in this just because /u/Uptomyknees (hi max!) is attached. If he has real creative control then there's a totally decent chance that something interesting will come of it."

It may lack almost any originality, but it's one of the best in its genre and it was good to see something with effort put into it. I particularly enjoyed the aesthetic. It was a beautiful looking movie. Wan's best work after Saw."

It had some genuine scares and a very intriguing story.  Not to mention that it has our beloved Patrick Wilson in it.

The Conjuring is that movie everybody who doesn't watch horror movies says is ""the best horror movie ever"" and I just try to shut up because I'm a horror nerd. I don't hate the movie or anything, it's just kinda bland.  It's ok. Pretty well directed. The writing is kind of bad and veeeery generic. I get that it's a well made movie but it's so generic it does nothing for me.  I'll give it some credit, it has some well crafted jump scares. Wan is good at that. But I don't think he's good at making the audience feel like there's something deadly going on, there doesn't seem to be any stakes. The ghost/demon is just spooking the people, it doesn't feel like they're in danger. They should've set up what could happen."

I also consider myself a huge, huge horror fan and would rather go to a genre festival (woooooooo bring on Fright Fest in August!) than watch multiplex horror because chances are Hollywood horrors will just be lowest-common-denominator drivel.   I mostly agree with what you've said about The Conjuring, but there was one stand-out scene for me which could have made the film so much more if they'd have stuck with that sort of style. The scene where the two girls are in their bedroom and one can see something in the corner behind the other one. That scene ratchets up in tension and the cynic in me waited for some bullshit jump scare, but refreshingly it never came. We never see, in that scene, exactly what the girls can see. I really wish The Conjuring had stuck with that premise - nothing is as scary as what an audience member can imagine, but unfortunately James Wan is an integral part of the Hollywood Horror set, so we're just going to get more popcorn cattle-prod cinema and the really good stuff will stay at the festivals for those who are dedicated enough to seek it out."
horror,3cnsdo,sarkata,3,Thu Jul 9 12:54:36 2015 UTC,Yeah that's basically my whole issue with it - I don't mind a small scale horror film but there have to be some stakes and they just felt so low in this movie that it didn't really make any impact.
horror,3cnsdo,poopcircle,2,Fri Jul 10 05:59:29 2015 UTC,The writing is kind of bad and veeeery generic.   I found myself laughing out loud at some of the dialogue in the movie.
horror,3cnsdo,slackingatlazyboy,0,Fri Jul 10 03:19:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree.  I just didn't get quite as scared as some of his other films.  I feel that he could have really hit it out of the park with this one and I guess they have to tone it down a bit for major audiences.  Great movie great acting great everything I just wanted it to be more scary and I felt the excorcism at the end was kinda weak
horror,3cnsdo,sarkata,3,Thu Jul 9 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"Argh, this movie got so many glowing reviews that I was super excited for it and then it just kind of fell flat for me. I'm a huge James Wan fan, as well - stylistically it was well crafted and i enjoyed some of the tension but the story didn't hit the mark for me.  There was nothing that made me care about any of the characters, the stakes felt extremely low, and the best scares were ruined by the trailer. The plot was fairly generic, which I don't mind generally speaking, but I just went into this movie wanting something to entertain me and despite my fairly low standards (I actually didn't entirely loathe hostel III and I am ashamed), I just felt kind of disappointed by it.  Different strokes for different folks, because most people I've spoken to adored it and I can respect that."
horror,3cnsdo,TheVeldt323,7,Fri Jul 10 05:58:02 2015 UTC,"If you ask me, this is Wan's best work. I love Saw, but the atmosphere and legitimate terror present in The Conjuring makes it a movie I just love."
horror,3cnsdo,1975bpo,2,Thu Jul 9 10:32:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's his most ""fun"" movie to watch, IMO, but I'm partial to haunted house stories."
horror,3cnsdo,SebOvette,7,Thu Jul 9 13:28:23 2015 UTC,"It's a well made, serviceable horror. The jump scares did their job.  Buuut the characters were forgettable and the film felt like a bunch of set pieces thrown together. Plus the possession at the end wasn't particularly scary and it felt like a way just to end the film"
horror,3cnsdo,lumpiestprincess,2,Thu Jul 9 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"This movie was amazing to see in theatres. The whole audience was screaming and then giggling at themselves and then screaming again.  I've seen it three times now and the only movie that still makes me as tense on repeated viewings is The Descent. The mom playing count and clap on the stairs, damn tense!"
horror,3cnsdo,prime613,3,Fri Jul 10 02:05:08 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this movie, even the doll segments. It is one of the few movies that I would class as genuine horror in recent years because it does not merely rely on jump scares. The whole story while unoriginal felt well crafted and the production values and acting were all on par."
horror,3cnsdo,I_Am_Not_Me_,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"I really liked this movie for how ""real"" it felt. When I was a kid, a lot of weird things happened in a ranch house I used to live at. I don't believe in supernatural demons and all that, but my aunt acting possessed, random things being set on fire in random rooms in the middle of the night, and bottles exploding randomly sure were creepy. This movie reminded me of that atmosphere, that nothing seemed so outlandish as to ruin the illusion."
horror,3cnsdo,DiscoDev,2,Thu Jul 9 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"Easily one of the better modern horror movies.  I had trouble sleeping for a few nights after I watched it.  The story was genuinely scary.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga both deliver strong performances.  My favorite scenes are the leg pulling scene in the bed, the cabinet leap scare, and the backstory of the witch.  I loved how Lorraine told the story while looking at the tree the witch hanged herself from.  Wan was able to get some interesting stuff out of that segment as far as framing and editing go.  I have seen this movie take some flack because people like to discredit the Warrens and their dealings with the supernatural.  I don't think that's particularly fair.  Even though they made it all up, it still makes for a good story that gave us a strong horror movie."
horror,3cnsdo,thedorkening,2,Thu Jul 9 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"I loved this movie.  The guys on the show still make fun of me since I had to watch it with the lights on... buuut I WAS watching it on Halloween with my wife-to-be in an unfamiliar place, in a BIG house in the woods where we were housesitting, and our domain was in the basement...."

horror,3cnsdo,EHendrix,-2,Thu Jul 9 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"For me this has to be the most overrated horror film in recent memory, more comparative to the transformers franchise than anything memorable.

horror,3cnsdo,wermode,0,Thu Jul 9 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I barely made it through this film partly because of the mishmash of cliches, but mostly because it seemed like one would have to accept nearly every possible superstition to believe the plot. I can suspend disbelief to enjoy a good story, but I can't totally switch off logic and reason over and over. It's too much to ask."

horror,3cnuwb,berriesthatburn,40,Fri Jul 10 06:26:42 2015 UTC,The Descent for sure. Already 10 years old and holds up very well.
horror,3cnuwb,white_water,4,Thu Jul 9 10:42:43 2015 UTC,"And really, really scary.   I saw it at the cinema, and about two thirds of the way through someone behind me got up to go to the loo. I saw them move out of the corner of my eye and nearly punched them in sheer terrified reflex. It was that scary."
horror,3cnuwb,cairmen,21,Thu Jul 9 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much love it gets here, because I don't know that it gets mentioned a lot, but my pick would be The Others (2001).   I just recently watched it (put it off for ages because it was spoiled for me), and I came away being truly impressed. The atmosphere was one of real dread, and the anxiety builds right from the beginning, in a large part due to a commanding performance from Kidman. She sells the movie from the get-go, and I found myself intrigued even through the relatively scare-less first act. Speaking of which, I may be biased toward it, but when slow-burn horror is done well, I think it is some of the most effective horror. It gives the audience a chance to process the characters and the situation before all hell breaks loose (and in this genre, sometimes literally).   The child actors, who are often a liability in horror film, do a great job, which also helps the mood in a way that it could not if the children were not convincing in their roles. There is no weak-link in the movie, and every scare is carefully considered for effect, and is plot-relevant; I could argue that it is one of the most economic horror films of all time. There are no wasted scares, and nothing seems half-baked. If it's quiet and moody, that's that, but when it wants to induce terror, it ratchets up and delivers.   It does rely a lot on how much you know about it going in, with less being better, but I think it's a thoroughly well done film. Calling anything a Thing-level masterpiece is tough, but I think The Others fits the bill.   Edit: One caveat I would add, is that I think The Others is a great example of the distinction between a tale of terror, and a tale of horror. The Others is resolutely a film reliant on terror, and in that way, makes itself distinct from a lot of modern era horror films. I don't know how much the horror/terror distinction is brought up on this sub, but I thought it was an interesting point."
horror,3cnuwb,TheMagician117,2,Thu Jul 9 13:36:47 2015 UTC,Damn I just checked IMDM to make sure that this was made after 2000.  Yes this movie defiantly deserves top ranking and it's streaming on netflix right now

horror,3cnuwb,dangertable,8,Thu Jul 9 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Session 9  A review I wrote of it a few years ago  I knew this was good but I'm not sure I appreciated how good when I first watched it.  The atmosphere is utterly oppressive right from the start, I almost felt glued to my seat throughout, the old mental hospital almost has a personality of it's own and totally oozes with despair and bad feeling. The soundtrack is perfect too, ranging from minimalist stabs on piano through to ominous bass throbs and demented, off kilter jack-in-the-box music, absolutely flawless.  The cast never put a foot wrong, each playing their part impeccably, the group dynamics are totally believable and ratchet up the tension further and further. Peter Mullan deserves special praise, giving yet another incredible performance.  This film has everything to make it a classic of the genre and it's disappointing how under appreciated it is, but at the same time, knowing as little about it as possible is the best way to see it. In fact, seeing it the second time knowing how it ends, maybe adds even more to it as I knew what to look out for and appreciated everything much more this time round."
horror,3cnuwb,cowegonnabechopps,3,Thu Jul 9 14:16:52 2015 UTC,"I hated Session 9 when it first released. It always struck me as a piggybacking to the ""cerebral"" suspense movies that were coming out around that time, wherein every protagonist wound up having multiple personalities or some sort of affliction that helped conceal the typically simple finale twist (Sixth Sense, Momento, Fight Club, Donnie Darko etc.) -- and even though I still think that's true, I've come to realize it's actually really good despite that.  Pretty much everything you said, I agree with.  And as somebody who used to sneak into the Danvers Mental Institution when I was a kid, I love the association with my own nostalgia towards that real-life building."

It is by one of the two guys that directed Rec, and he has made a LOT of horror movies in his life, and I think all of them are much better than Darkness (except maybe the Rec sequels, 2 and 3 are about on par and 4 is worse than Darkness)."

It stuck with the movie plot enough to make me nostalgic, and threw in exactly enough new stuff to keep me interested.

horror,3ck237,TheMagician117,12,Wed Jul 8 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a little hesitant, but I think it could be kitschy fun. It occupies a weird space; if you go full horror you lose younger fans, and if you go light-hearted you potentially take out the nostalgic older audience.   I don't think it's targeting the standard r/horror demographic. It's a family flick, and given the source material, I'd say that's okay. If it has heart and humor, with an ostensibly ""horror"" coat of paint, it'll do well. The books weren't exactly bastions of cold terror (even if I occasionally worry that a sponge will bite me when I reach under the sink)."
horror,3ck237,megatom0,5,Wed Jul 8 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"To me this is something that will only work for adults on a pure nostalgia level, and honestly that is working very well for me. I think for kids they will have enough fun with the different monsters and stuff. I mean I wasn't expecting much from a goosebumps movie. The books were fun as a kid but don't hold up at all as an adult. I like how this basically is Monster Squad 2015."
horror,3ck237,pushytub,2,Wed Jul 8 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"They're releasing it at the perfect time, since the older generation that is nostalgic for this series now have kids that are the perfect age for this type of movie, so they'll potentially be drawing a larger and less-reluctant parental audience to theaters. It's like Jumanji or Night at the Museum but with an already established ""lore"" so to speak, especially now that parents are seeing this trailer and getting their kids to read the old books over the summer. Could be very profitable."

I know I was pausing it just to pick out different monsters and trying to remember the books they came from. This is like the Avengers of Goosebumps. I don't think any individual book could carry an entire film but this route seems big and fun, kind of like Monster Squad or something."
horror,3ck237,-Poe-,2,Wed Jul 8 21:28:13 2015 UTC,That was a really badly made trailer. Do they not have editors?

horror,3ck237,joezombie,2,Thu Jul 9 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"I was originally very excited for this, but now I'm not so sure. Yes, Goosebumps was a children's horror series, yet the show was still eerily creepy with a slice of cheese. This movie looks like it wants to deliver more laughs than scares (or what is considered scary to a child).    Also worth mentioning is the awful CGI. I think I'll catch this one when its available for streaming. I just hope the trailer is misleading and the film strikes a fair balance between ""horror"" and comedy.    This isn't the 90s anymore though, and I'm sure they're wanting to appeal to today's young generation with a more family-oriented adventure film starring silly monsters."

horror,3cnk7i,Throwawaylikeits1992,15,Thu Jul 9 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"I mean a lot of your dislike seems to stem from the fact that the movie didn't tell you everything, which is one of the things that I really liked about it. The creature is a cool monster BECAUSE you don't know what it is, or how to stop it. It's basically impending doom personified. No one's really been able to survive it, and if it isn't stalking you, you can't see it, so why would there be any real information on it? I liek that there wasn't a simple website that magically tells the main characters everything they need to know.   Did she have sex with the guys on the boat?   Yes, that's why she took off her clothes before walking into the water and looks so defeated when she's driving back home. And then when you see the creature again, it's implied that it killed the men on the boat anyway and is following her again, meaning the degrading act she did was literally for nothing, which is why she breaks down in the car.   Oh Greg wakes up and now he's having sex with her   The movie implies in multiple scenes that Greg is a bit of a manwhore. The first scene we see of him is him bringing a girl home. After having sex we see him in the cafeteria flirting with more woman. Jay says that they've hooked up in the past and it's no big deal. Greg didn't believe in the curse, got to have sex with an ex, and Jay gets some peace of mind knowing that if the curse is real, it won't be coming for her.   I'm guessing it was supposed to be her dad, but it's never explained why   Again, the movie doesn't directly say anything except showing that the form It takes at the end is indeed her father, but from her refusal to tell her sister who she sees and her reluctance to talk about him in general, along with the themes of the movie, you can assume that he probably did something terrible to the girls, i.e. molestation, and that is why he's no longer in their lives.   Yes, let's have someone who hasn't been trained in proper firearm use a gun shoot at an invisible monster UNDER WATER and score a clean headshot. Also instead of running around unplugging electronics let's just scream while this thing throws shit in the pool.   I mean what else where they supposed to do? They trained with the gun up at the lake house. It's not like they could've got a police officer to help since he wouldn't have believed them. While a clean headshot is a little unrealistic, he also misses and almost hits Jay so it's some based in reality. And I'm pretty sure I remember Jay's sister or friend running around trying to unplug things, if only during a brief shot.  About the final thing with the friend, it's pretty easy to assume that since the house alarm was going he probably couldn't hear Jay's warning about opening the door. I didn't really have any problem wit this scene and found it wonderfully disturbing.  So it seems like what you didn't liek about the film is exactly what a lot of people love about it and that's that it doesn't spell everything out for you. It makes you connect the dots and watch every scene and speculate on what happens without showing you everything. It adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie where events are sort of hazily strung together. A lot of it is intentionally ambiguous, which some people like and others do not. personally, I thought it was great, but I did have a few problems with it-mainly It's physicality and lacked another good gory death, especially after that great opening scene.   But hey, everybody's wants different things from a movie, and I can understand being let down if you wanted more concrete answers. I also thought the Babadook was slightly better, but still loved It Follows."

Again it's the pathetically stupid characters that drove me insane throughout the film.  Also, no I don't need everything explained to me. As I said I loved The Babdook, but the Babadook made sense, and while it didn't really tell much, it gave us plenty of Lore and back story to fall back on so that the viewer could come up with their own theory and try to guess what the monster was.   It Follows tells you nothihg, and not in a good way. Not in a scary way. Like I said the idea of an unkillable demon following you is creepy in itself, but the fact that nothing is told to the viewer throughout the film just makes it hard to keep up and keeps us interested.  Me and my girlfriend were laughing through most of the movie from how stupid these people acted."
horror,3cnk7i,fedaykin13,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"I liked It Follows although it was more creepy than scary. I also like it didn't explain everything as so many do. I like things being a mystery sometimes. We don't always need explanations. Whatever you think it is, that's what it is. We'll just never know what it was, unless they do explain it in the next one.  I also really hated the Babadook. They spelled it out like it was a horror movie and then you find out the hard truth. Also the ultra-Australian accents were hard to listen to. Watching it was a hard task."
horror,3cnk7i,Thakgor,-3,Thu Jul 9 09:04:43 2015 UTC,"The Babadook was really falsely advertised. It's a horror movie, but not a creature feature like they billed it."

That is your opinion.  First time I've personally seen one person have those opinions on those two movies.  Just goes to show how wildly varying taste can be.  I was a little disappointed with It Follows. But that is mainly because I loved so much of it but felt it was missing something and that something could have made this into a classic.

horror,3cnk7i,frofrodajimmyboy,2,Fri Jul 10 12:26:43 2015 UTC,It's just not scary. The director seemed to be IN LOVE with the score (which is good) and the style of the film more than actually making it frightening. It's not really a great movie outside of the way it looks and the music.

horror,3clowd,gramteek,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:30:05 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: I'm gonna watch this shit.  I vote good, but then again I like the Goosebumps show from years ago. I'm aware that it was low budget, poorly acted, and the plots were generally all the same, but at the end of the day I still enjoyed it. This effort has a well-known actor in Jack Black and unquestionably a better budget. However, those two ingredients do not make a good production. As others have said, it's targeted as a family feature, but that shouldn't be surprising considering the source material is meant for younger children. As others have also said, it is being classified as a horror-comedy. In my opinion, this isn't necessarily a bad thing when it comes to Goosebumps. The show always had moments where it tried to be funny, but mostly just came off as very cheesy and cringe-worthy. While I think that the corny humor of the old show added to the charm of the show, others may feel that it pulled them away from the horror elements if not turning them away from the show entirely. My question then is who, as a teenager or an adult, watches a Goosebumps episode or reads a Goosebumps novel hoping to get a dark, grim, and richly eerie tale? My guess would be not many people. Most audiences know what to expect from a Goosebumps effort: a horror tale told in a sometimes slightly creepy way while remaining lighthearted to its core. To me, Goosebumps is the definition of nostalgia as it possibly is for many others here and elsewhere. In recent years, R.L. Stine's show The Haunting Hour has essentially brought Goosebumps back for a younger, more modern generation of young people. While I've seen quite a few of those episodes as well, I don't feel as if they quite stack up to Goosebumps. This could be partially because I have Goosebumps on a pedestal in my memories somewhere between discovering internet porn and chocolate pudding, but I feel it is more because the stories aren't as fresh. Some of the episodes within The Haunting Hour (notably the TV movie Don't Think About It, the episode involving werewolves at an old inn, or the episode where a young boy's older sister is a witch) did a great job of channeling the same feeling that its older brother Goosebumps did, but many episodes either fall completely flat or are just plain garbage. Fucking clowns? The kid turned into a goddamn clown? Right. But the stories from the Goosebumps shows and books had a way of playing on serious horror movie themes and elements in a way that younger audiences could understand and watch without being too afraid. It filled a niche in our helix of entertainment in a way that, in my opinion, wasn't done by other shows. Shows like Nickelodeon's Are You Afraid of the Dark and Disney's So Weird were both decent shows at the time (and shows that I remember fondly), but were much more serious in tone and nature and usually had moments that were too taxing on younger viewers whether it be in horror or in plot. Other shows like Scooby-Doo were almost purely comedic and the horror in them was rarely fulfilling enough to satiate the need for something a bit spookier. And then other shows, such as The X-Files and Tales from the Crypt, are meant for an audience of teenagers and up. Goosebumps was the happy medium; it gave us enough horror and scary themes that we were (usually) not left wanting more while also not being too scary to exclude certain members of the family. Personally, I feel that this Goosebumps film will be something I will watch and enjoy. I'm optimistic, perhaps too much so. However, because the movie is drawing upon classic Goosebumps stories (or appears to be from what I've come across) while still keeping the dialed-down horror in balance with some family-friendly comedy I feel that it will be a worth-while watch. I doubt it will receive rave reviews and I don't expect it to start a revolution, but I do feel that some people may be pleasantly surprised by what this movie ends up being. I could be wrong and this opus could be all for naught, but I hope I'm right because the success of this film could spawn other similar projects that help keep horror accessible to all ages. If it's good, awesome. If it's bad, then it's bad and we all move on. Nonetheless, I urge you to give it a watch. If not for me or for yourselves, do it for the kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiids."

horror,3cj99z,introvertonelmstreet,5,Wed Jul 8 10:02:29 2015 UTC,"Whether you're a King fan, or Kubrick fan (or both) Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for making this film a horror masterpiece. Everybody, horror fan or not, knows classic lines from this movie and the memorable ending scene (which was shot beautifully). The elements that Kubrick added to the film like the twins, the famous ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" make this film a psychologically terrifying, and haunting masterpiece. You also have to give credit where credit is due, and Nicholson brought a new perspective to Jack, I think he really nailed his performance. To each their own, but I like to judge the book and the film as their own elements, the film being a different interpretation of the story and symbolism."
horror,3cj99z,shrimpcreole,5,Wed Jul 8 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer to consider the film apart from King's book because the substance is fairly different (film: the horror of the self; book: deep supernatural disturbance).  And the film is lovely, all manic and warped.  The staging and visuals are really haunting."
horror,3cj99z,DiscoDev,2,Wed Jul 8 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"This movie has an incredible tone and atmosphere.  The imagery and sounds are just so haunting.  I love the feeling of seclusion that the Overlook Hotel provides.  I always felt as if it was an additional character in the film.  Kubrick created a great sensory experience with this movie.  Watching Jack's slow descent into madness while his family is just going about their business is always frightening.  They have no idea that Jack is about to try and slaughter them, either due to paranormal interference or, depending on your personal interpretation, by his own madness.    A little story about an experience I had years ago after watching The Shingin - I was returning the DVD to Family Video's drop box at around 3:00 AM.  I had just watched it with a friend.  I was a bit on edge after just having watched The Shining, so when I dropped the movie into the slot I looked into the darkness of Family Video and swore I saw the bear suit guy that was receiving fellatio in the film peek his head up behind some of the video shelves.  I ran to my car and felt uneasy during my drive home."
horror,3cj99z,GoryWizard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"I recently finished reading the sequel to the novel, Doctor Sleep, and it was a blast catching up with Dan Torrence as he battled against a roaming tribe of shinning sucking demons. The movie is iconic, and it still holds up amazing well."
horror,3cj99z,Satan-Loves-You,0,Wed Jul 8 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Such a fantastic film. Stanley Kubrick gets the atmosphere just right in pretty much every film he's ever made. I feel that his rendition of Stephen Kings story is way better than the book.   I also find it funny that King actually hated the film because it focused on madness more than ghosts, but its honestly more horrifying this way."
horror,3cj99z,SGT_BUTTSTICK,3,Wed Jul 8 12:17:16 2015 UTC,King actually hates it mainly because in the book Jack Torrance is a more or less normal guy who slowly becomes crazy upon being influenced by the hotel.  he feels that in the movie Torrance is crazy from the get-go so Torrances insanity by the end of the movie doesnt hit quite as hard
horror,3cj99z,Satan-Loves-You,0,Wed Jul 8 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"Really? I remembered reading that he didn't like it, I just figured he didn't like Kubricks adaptation of it because it was different than the book. I thought Nicholsons character was normal in the beginning, besides being a rough father. Would you agree with King?"
horror,3cj99z,SGT_BUTTSTICK,5,Wed Jul 8 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"I understand where King is coming from in some of his criticisms like when he says he didn't like the female lead's performance, not so sure I fully agree with him about Nicholson being a bad casting job.  I love them both but I prefer the book, with that being said I think it would be hard for Kubrick to touch on all the themes that King uses in the book (another criticism) in the relatively short amount of time you get to use in a movie.  I think the book is more fleshed out and the characters are much much better but as a horror movie I still think the movie works extremely well."
horror,3cj99z,BloodofGallifrey,2,Wed Jul 8 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. During this last Spring semester, I took a Haunted Lit class and got to read the book as part of the curriculum. We also had a showing of the movie during the weekend.   Both the book and the movie are amazing, but each in their respective manner. Kubrick is a mad genius of film, a master but so is King, in his own honor, of horror novels.   Personally, I agree with King's statements about not liking Shelley Duvall and her portrayal of Wendy. In the book, the character was strong, she could hold her own against Jack and his increasing madness. She wasn't a desperate, broken down woman, she was still her own being. In the film, partly because Kubrick's treatment of Duvall, Wendy was portrayed as this meek, blubbering wife who is a bit of a helicopter to her husband.   However, Kubrick's ending is great. While I like that in the novel, Jack does retain a bit of his humanity, of her normal, sane self, in the film, he is utterly consumed both mentally and physically (in a way) as evident by the photograph of the party."
horror,3cj99z,gemininature,2,Wed Jul 8 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"Movie Wendy was definitely a broken-down, meek, scared woman, but I feel like that was an apt change, considering the changes made to Jack's character as well. Both changed from a loving semi-normal family to a repressive, abusive/fearful family situation where the dad is always one step from flipping out, the mom is constantly walking on eggshells, and the son is dissociated and lost in fantasies. Just my opinion though"
horror,3cj99z,BloodofGallifrey,2,Thu Jul 9 06:09:56 2015 UTC,Good point. I did like Danny's portrayal. The whole weird little voice and finger thing when Tony speaks to him...completely unsettling. I do love Jack Nicholson performance.   Plus all of the cinematography of the movie is downright awesome. I do love how the hotel seems impossible because of its dimensions and some of the shots that take place within some scenes. It adds to the unnatural feeling that the Overlook should have.
horror,3cj99z,jubjub2184,0,Thu Jul 9 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"My favorite horror film of all time, I know it isn't a great adaptation, but I believe it is superior to the source material, between the nod where we pass the wrecked vehicle that was from the novel, showcasing that this was Kubrick's film. From the nauseating and confusing building layout, to the unnerving descent of Jack. This is one of the few horror films I can call a masterpiece.   I am a huge fan of Kubrick so it does skew my opinion of the film. But the symbolism, the writing, the setting, the cinematography and the lingering sense of dread the film gives off just sucks you in, and doesn't spit you back out until the credits. If you're reading this, and have not seen the film you should move it to the very top of your list. If you've seen it before and weren't crazy about it, I suggest giving it a second try. It is not only my favorite horror film, but it is in my top five films of all time."

I love Nicholson in this movie, and I consider his acting to be the only reason I have seen it more than once. I think the other actors might have annoyed me and ruined the feel and mood of the film. I haven't figured it out, because it is so popular and so iconic, I really feel like I'm missing something."

He had a movie called My Name is Bruce that came out in 2008(?) and was pretty good. Both he and Raimi were producers on the Evil Dead remake so I think they still have it.

horror,3clvml,comichorrorweirdo,2,Thu Jul 9 01:39:22 2015 UTC,"The only one of those I'd even consider close to superior would be Dead Snow 2. Starry Eyes? Not even close. Wolf Creek 2? DRAMATICALLY inferior to the first film. I don't even want to speak on Blood Glacier lmao.   Babadook earned a lot of hype true but the sad thing is if people hadn't gone apeshit about it and talked on it endlessly, the masses would be calling it one of the greatest genre films of the last 2 two decades. Damn shame that fan chatter can damage a film's reputation. As for the female lead... oh my god was she amazing. VERY, VERY rarely do you see a performer travel that gamut of emotions so staggeringly effective. A career defining performance, and I can't think of a female lead in a recent horror that even comes close to rivaling it. This is, of course, just my opinion."
horror,3clvml,comichorrorweirdo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:19:53 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I think the hype around Babadook just killed it for a lot of people.

The versatility of her emotions and the depth with which she conveyed them was fucking phenomenal.

With a 3 minute trailer, I got all the enjoyment I'm capable of getting from what is sure to be an onslaught of references. I do appreciate the horror nerdiness on display here, though and it does appear to be well shot on a shoestring budget.

The movie is no masterpiece but it certainly isn't bad. Pretty action packed for a found footage film. And actually a pretty decent premise imo. Filmed in the actual catacombs as well if I remember correctly.
horror,3ci699,royjones,3,Wed Jul 8 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Critics can suck it. Case in point: V/h/s: Viral was heavily panned by critics, and while it definitely was the worst one in the series, I loved all the short films in it.

horror,3ch4x4,dazeymayhem,2,Tue Jul 7 22:38:55 2015 UTC,Useless trivia but the only reason I remember this movie... We'd rented it and ordered pizza. Went ahead and started watching it while waiting - completely forgetting about the pizza. Delivery guy knocks on the door - scared us all half to death and sent us into a screaming fit - I think we were more scared by the other person scared and it just snowballed. Finally get to the door almost in tears - and the poor kid delivering the pizza was also terrified. He didn't know what was going on and was about to call 911.  Don't really remember much about the movie - but damn that pizza.

Anytime you mention it to her, especially in front of other people, she won't hesitate to tell you about when she took me to see tremors when I was little and then woke up screaming that night because I thought they were coming through the walls.  Still loved the movie though. One of the best creature features out there! Only until I was an adult did I realize that this is more of a silly b-movie than an actual scary movie, but little old me certainly didn't think that. Shit was terrifying!"
horror,3cerew,ChickenWhiskers,6,Tue Jul 7 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"In Tremors,  the town of Perfection is a place established and engineered with the plot in mind. I love that - and  you seldom see it in movies nowadays, where he action just always seems to happen in these generic sandbox locations and you can never tell just where you are. Movies associate action with scale: Big cities or planets with cobalt buildings...no unique characteristics; just stuff to knock over. It's sort of a lost art from movies during the late-80's and early-90's.  Even Jurassic World, which leans on it's setting as a plot device, doesn't do as good a job as Tremors does in this regard. You get a few glimpses at key locations, but you're never really sure of the scale or mapping of it.   Buildings in Perfection are well-mapped and labeled, allowing the viewers to get a good grasp of how far the worms are, or even how far each character is from one another. Even if you've only seen the movie once or twice, you still associate certain set pieces to specific scenes. The town is important for the townfolks survival, so they rely on it's structures. It's a cool concept that gives us the scare-device of vulnerability.   The cast is really fantastic, too. I feel like Michael Gross doesn't get the cult-status love he deserves. Burt Gummer is a horror-comedy icon."

My childhood best friend and I probably watched it together a few dozen times.  For some reason (and this is as pedantic as it gets) I always have a hard time classifying this as a horror film.

Kubrick was telling a different story than King in a completely different way, and both are best enjoyed as separate things.  To conflate the two is to do a disservice to both.  Adding a hedge maze from a movie King hated to the hotel that inspired him to write the book is an insult to him."

Noroi (The Curse) is a Japanese horror film that is right up your alley.  I think it even has old books mentioning 1000 year old demons.   I have been unable to find one with dubbed english yet, so you may have to deal with subs.   It's worth it.  The Possession (2012) has a lot of Jewish lore and demons.  Another one without a lot of love is the House on Haunted Hill remake.   Personally, I loved it, but it's very 90s.   It's about an abandoned insane asylum haunted by the ghosts of the lunatics who were tortured to death by the crazy doctor, but on top of that we learn that hill the asylum was built on, is itself possessed by an ancient demon-god who imprisons and feeds upon souls.  The Legend of Hell House is a classic haunted house film.  It's a little slow by today's standards, but it's got lore all over the place."

horror,3cgatu,SterlingBowman,5,Tue Jul 7 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Horror games? Oh man, where do I even start with my recommendations.   A few games made by a developer called Frictional are frequently mentioned in discussions such as this, and with good reason. They include Penumbra: Overture, its sequel Penumbra: Black Plague, and a spiritual successor called Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I recommend all of them. Playing through the final moments of Penumbra: Overture was possibly the most terrifying experience I've ever had in a video game. You can't really fight enemies in these - your only option is to run and hide when anything hostile comes your way, and Amnesia had a Sanity meter that would induce interesting subtle effects if you allowed it to drop too much.  Outlast (and its DLC expansion Whistleblower) is in a similar vein to the Frictional titles. You can't fight enemies, but it has a neat gimmick of being what is essentially an interactive ""found footage"" horror movie. You have a camera that acts as your flashlight in the dark and can zoom in to view things at a distance and you have to escape an asylum that has been thrown into complete chaos, so you're constantly viewing the awful things around you through the grainy filter of a camera lens.   Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut and Cry of Fear are both Half-Life 1 mods on PC that are well worth playing if you want something that includes a fair amount of combat, albeit with limited ammo for your firearms. The former game does require you to own a copy of Half-Life, but Cry of Fear can be played on its own for free through Steam. Grey is a Half-Life 2 mod that's similar to both. All three have very bizarre, dream-like enemies and environments.   For something more action-oriented, the Dead Space trilogy is excellent. The series veered more towards action than horror as it went on, but if you play them on harder difficulties, the Necromorphs can still be pretty goddamn scary when you know how quickly they can kill you and three are charging down a hallway."

horror,3cgatu,Booty_Bowl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Darkest Dungeon is a wonderful lovecraftian ""roguelike"" with 2d Mike Mignola-esque art. It has turn based combat and just seeps flavor for the world it's set in. I love the narrator.   Sunless Sea has some hints of horror in it's underground nautical exploration game. A bit of warning though there isn't a ton in the way of gameplay and at times feels more like you are reading a book. If you don't mind the slow pace it can really suck you in.   Condemned 2 is one of my favorite horror games and my first real introduction to the genre. The story was alright but it was the subtle ways the game would mess with you that really blew my mind. The whole first person brawler approach, where it almost felt like a boxing game was real interesting to me. The fact that you couldn't reload firearms and melee weapons deteriorated as you used them helped to amp up the stress.   I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream Is a pretty cool sci-fi/horror game based on the Harlan Ellison story of the same name. If you don't mind point and click adventure games I'd say it's worth a play.   Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a pretty cool Lovecraft game if you are into his stuff. If you can get past outdated graphics and clunky controls what I've played of it seems pretty great story and setting wise. Admittedly I haven't made it to far into this one though.  As far as board games if you can get enough like minded people together and willing to play a game for an unreasonable length of time just to lose I love Arkham Horror.   Mansions of Madness is another fun one that seems to be a little less of a time commitment.   Zombies!!! and Cthulhu!!! by Twilight Creations are both a whole lot of fun. Zombies has plenty of campy, movie inspired expansions and if I remember correctly two versions of it playing up Evil Dead and Army of Darkness vibes. It's a really simple game, a little bit of action, a little bit of exploration, a bit of screwing each other over. It's an easy party game that you can drink and play.   Finally, if you can get people together for it and someone to put in the time and effort it takes to be a decent keeper there's Call of Cthulhu, the pen and paper rpg. The system has been around for quite a while a boasts in my opinion the best catalog of premade scenarios. It's a pretty intuitive system in my opinion that lends itself well to houserules depending on how crunchy you want your games.   Hope some of these were useful suggestions, I know my personal preferences can lean pretty hard the Lovecraft direction."

horror,3cev1g,IncendiaryLemon88,3,Tue Jul 7 10:53:09 2015 UTC,"I felt the same as you when I first saw the film. After reading a few reviews/analyses of it, I now think that it's one of the most intelligent horror films ever made. I'll copy paste an IMDB review that really helped me understand where the film was coming from below. The IMDB reviews by gmwhite and dresh79 are also really good:   The problem that many people have with Audition, as with much of the cinema of Takeshi Miike, is in the film's unwillingness to conform to a single generic structure. It's very much a Hollywood ideal that a film should have a ""story"", with a distinct beginning, middle and end, and that that particular story should conform to a series of rules and regulations that let the audience know exactly where they are at all times. So, we're sort of aware of the idea that its fun to play around with the audience, but it's best not to push it too far -- if you get what I mean?  The power of Audition, like many of Miike's other works, is that it is constantly trying to disarm and confuse the viewer - by playing with their expectations of genre and the iconography therein - before then going to bizarre (Happiness of the Katakuris) or indeed, downright disturbing (Visitor Q) lengths to pull the rug out from under us. So, with Audition, we have a film that begins as a routine melodrama, with our central character mourning the loss of his wife and struggling to raise his young son as a single parent; which is all shot naturalistically and sympathetically to the characters as three-dimensional beings. As the film progresses, it moves into its second stage; introducing a romantic subplot and briefly toying with the notions of the romantic comedy (a sort of Sleepless in Kyoto, if you will). It actually takes a full forty to fifty minutes before the film even suggestions anything slightly sinister, with a ringing telephone and the sudden movement of ""something"" held captive inside a festering burlap sack.  As a result, the film can often be seen as a muddled mess to those who come to it expecting one thing or another. Now, this isn't a problem with the film, but rather, a problem with how the film has been marketed, with too much expectation established by the UK distributors selling the film as a horror picture - which it is - but not in the traditional sense. Miike has stated that his intention with the film, when released in Japan at the end of the last century, was to market it as a traditional romantic drama, omitting all the shock scenes that occur in the last thirty minutes and setting it up to be a charming, frothy, feel-good film. This way the audience would be more disturbed by the eventual reveal in the final act, as our central character Shigeharu begins to further investigate Asami's dark past with devastating consequences.  Here in the UK and in America however, we know of the film as ""one of the most disturbing of all time"" and come to it with an impression of Miike as a director of ultra-violent, hyper-kinetic and wildly disturbing psychodramas like Ichi the Killer, Visitor Q, Gozu, and his infamous episode of Masters of Horror (which was so confrontational it was banned by U.S. TV). In reality, Miike is an incredibly varied filmmaker; as comfortable with violent crime films as he is with abstract horror, and that's not even mentioning the number of sensitive dramas and neo-realist films he's worked on, such as Ley Lines, The Bird People in China, White Collar Worker Kintaro and The Great Yokai War.  Audition for me was an incredibly thought-provoking film; entertaining, sinister and occasionally quite moving in regards to it's subtle depiction of the sense of alienation central to Japanese art, literature and culture, and in also suggesting the desperate lengths that lonely characters will go in order to feel some sort of connection to the outside world. The slow-burning mood worked incredibly well for me, as did the more elegant film-making style that screams quality; once again showing us that Miike is capable of moving away from the gonzo style of his earlier crime pictures and really reminding us of the cold, clinical elegance of the work of a director like Stanley Kubrick; in particular A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut (which was released during the same year), with its continual use of muted colours, low-key lighting and imaginative use of space."
horror,3cev1g,TheWetRat,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"Good write up. I do feel as if it's marketing (Well, not exactly marketing, what I heard online and it's reputation) did lessen the experience. If I went in under the assumption of it being a romance movie and the horror element had blindsided me, I would have been a lot more shocked and probably wouldn't liked it more."
horror,3cev1g,wiggen_tree,6,Tue Jul 7 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"Seeking ""help to appreciate it"" makes me think of people I've spoken to who tell me ""I never used to like beer, but I just kept drinking it and hating it a little less each time until I got used to it"", I've heard people say the same thing about eating olives or coriander/cilantro. It seems like a really stupid waste of time to me to force yourself to like something just because everyone says you should. Reading the way you described it, it doesn't seem like you ""didn't get it"" just that you didn't particularly like it as much as you expected to. I would suggest that you come to terms with that, trust your opinion and move on with your life. It's OK to feel differently about stuff."

It's broken up in sequences that read like short stories, but do contribute to a whole. The writing itself is okay, and it often relies on ""what a twist!"" tropes, but there's something about it that just works; it's like a written collection of campfire stories. I think it would actually be great to read aloud with friends in a setting like that.   Otherwise, unfortunately I've been into older stuff lately.

I think the old footage was what Anna was seeing, and the cult's ""afterlife"" was just a person's memories playing back. It seems like Anna was talking to the Madame for a long time, and she was probably telling her what she was seeing - ie the happy memories of her and her friend.   The Madame killed herself because she had no memories like this, all she had done with her life was cause torture and suffering to people. That's why she said ""keep doubting"", because their ""afterlife"" was not what they expected it to be."

What might be unsettling, scary or upsetting to you is relaxing to someone else. That being said, here's some examples of thing's that might have a creepy or unsettling vibe.  Aphex Twin - Gwarek, doesn't have the same effect now but I remember listening to this half asleep in the dark and scaring myself shitless.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQxB8qIqoPE  Zach Hill - Necromancer, the drummer from Death Grips (who also make music with a weird, but not necessarily scary vibe), dunno this isn't really scary but it has a timbral quality that reminds me of a 1970's horror movies. Might just be me.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NND0T1pWbt4  Thinking Plague, yeah the top youtube comment for this says it all: 'Bad trip music'. Yep.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBR61aXrBXc  Throbbing Gristle - Hamburger Lady, because of course Throbbing Gristle. Shit's scary.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzDvpT-MjYs  and of course this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJJ-QkZ8cM  Listening to Thinking Plague makes me think this has a lot to do with context. None of this is gonna seem 'scary' when you're sitting in your room but i'm sure it could in another situation. Anyway I hope at least one of the above scared you a little bit."

horror,3cb4gc,deepsixz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:10:48 2015 UTC,They can overlap definately like The Human Centipede or Tusk or American Mary they aren't the same. TP is torture for the sake of torture with no real point (like the Guinea Pig films) and sometimes that does happen with body horror films just being about people melting. But at times Body Horror can have really complicated deeper meanings for example Possession from 1981 some say its that movie where a spoiler While others might read into it more and look at how the film is actually an alagory for spoiler Or in Cronenberg's Videodrome as well as Lynch's Eraserhead some say its just some random surreal body horror moments. While Eraserhead is actually about spoiler and Videodrome is actually about spoiler Those are the differences.
horror,3cb4gc,TheVeldt323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"""Torture porn"" is what you call a movie when you want to dismiss it as tastelessly violent, especially in films that prominently feature scenes of people making other people  suffer intense physical/psychological pain FOR NO GOOD REASON other than to promote the audience's  sadistic enjoyment of human suffering.

I intend to get the blu-ray that was just released by fall.  sidenote...the excellent band, Broadcast, was very influenced by this film and even dedicated a song to it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as5ZdjYGdRY"
horror,3c97wj,RSTROMME,31,Mon Jul 6 18:08:19 2015 UTC,Yellowbrickroad made me feel really unsettled just such a strange feel to it
horror,3c97wj,BrutalCowbell,8,Mon Jul 6 03:56:30 2015 UTC,"Watched that movie alone in a dark room at 3 in the morning and it was one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. That movie made me feel so off, sort of like the feeling you get after watching a really fucked up video online or something. Had the worst dreams of my life that night, 10/10, highly recommend"
horror,3c97wj,BelugaFetus,2,Mon Jul 6 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing! Well, not completely alone, my bf was asleep next to me but I had to try my best not to wake him up because he had work in the morning. I agree though, it makes you feel not right after watching it. Going to the bathroom afterwards was so creepy, the glow of the dim nightlight in the hallway casting shadows on the walls in an eerie silence... shudder"
horror,3c97wj,the_drunken_cook,7,Tue Jul 7 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite movies. The scene where the guy is in the cave the girl is sitting in front of and he starts talking to her. Ooh shivers, man."
horror,3c97wj,SwarleyStinson21,3,Mon Jul 6 06:51:06 2015 UTC,SPOILERS  The thing with the arm just came out of fucking nowhere after an otherwise semi-normal period of people's tempers ramping up like usual. And then suddenly a guy just ripped a girl's arm off somewhere out of shot and is beating her with it somewhere far in the distance.   I was sold.
horror,3c97wj,BlooWhite,3,Mon Jul 6 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was pretty good, the theme of isolation in the wilderness is done very well. Although I didn't understand the ending at all."
horror,3c97wj,geengaween,2,Mon Jul 6 14:26:14 2015 UTC,This. I LOVED where that movie was going. WHAT A RUSH! and then no one knows how to end this. Insert metaphorical dribble so viewer can expound their own version of what 'really happened'.
horror,3c97wj,Brookface,3,Mon Jul 6 15:57:18 2015 UTC,Tried watching it. Good premise but it bored me to death
horror,3c97wj,Ektojinx,15,Wed Jul 8 05:30:00 2015 UTC,The first time I has seen The human centipede. I found that movie to be very disturbing the first go round. It was just so different then anything I had watched before.
horror,3c97wj,grt8ness2017,4,Mon Jul 6 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Same here.  Glad I watched it for the first time totally alone.  Its a pretty divisive movie with horror fans but I still think it's an overall solid horror movie, beyond its premise."

horror,3c97wj,Willravel,48,Mon Jul 6 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"The Mothman Prophesies. I know it's not generally considered a thriller/horror classic, but, despite some issues with the script, the movie is very unsettling. I really remember appreciating the sparse lore creeping its way gradually into the movie, revealing some force which was deeply ambiguous, straddling the line between malevolent and benevolent, but surely far beyond us, and that worked because of the camera work, the shots, the movement, the lighting and color, etc. Mark Pellington, the director, probably deserves most of the credit. I don't know that I'd go so far as to call it scary, but the new lore (new to me at least) combined with excellent direction really got under my skin in a good way.   I wish there were more horror movies that too cryptozoology really seriously."

It's super effective going through those taped sessions, and the story with him hiding in the bedroom while the young couple has sex and then later he kills them super brutally really affected me. Made me super paranoid for a while."
horror,3c97wj,dharmabird67,5,Mon Jul 6 13:57:42 2015 UTC,Came here to mention the same film- saw it on YT a while back and some scenes still pop into my mind sometimes - very disturbing flick.

horror,3c97wj,BlooWhite,2,Mon Jul 6 13:26:36 2015 UTC,I remember when that was just a thirty second clip on youtube and nobody anywhere knew what it was from. Just a psycho in an upside down mask crabwalking to a terrified prisoner with no context or explanation. I have yet to see the movie because I don't want the little clip ruined for me!

horror,3c97wj,masternance,30,Mon Jul 6 03:37:20 2015 UTC,My biggest hope for the sequel is that they don't turn Bughuul into a slasher type villain where you constantly see him in full view. Part of what made the first one so good was that we only see glimpses of him for most of the movie.
horror,3c97wj,IcicleTrepan,11,Mon Jul 6 03:54:03 2015 UTC,In part 2 he joins black metal band Immortal :)
horror,3c97wj,eggsbaconandtoast,4,Mon Jul 6 12:00:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I hope they leave a little to the imagination. Bughuul's presence is much creepier when he is concealed in the background as opposed to right in your face."
horror,3c97wj,TrepanationBy45,3,Mon Jul 6 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Psychological scares are the key, because they let you and your own personality create the monster."

horror,3c97wj,thrillho145,16,Mon Jul 6 13:04:01 2015 UTC,"Finally saw it last night after managing to avoid all reviews and spoilers. I didn't even know the premise going in. (Though I naturally assumed something would be following someone, haha.)  I haven't been legitimately creeped out by a horror movie in a long time, possibly decades. I've been 'scared' plenty (as in boo! scared) and I've felt tense a few times. But shivers-down-my-spine creeped out, the way you feel when you're a kid alone in a dark house? I'd forgotten it was possible for a movie to do that.  It wasn't perfect but goddamn it was effective."
horror,3c97wj,Duck-Schmuck,3,Mon Jul 6 06:22:15 2015 UTC,yeah dude. i had to close all my blinds after watching that film. kept imaging it staring at me through my window. never has a film made me so uncomfortable after the film ended

The first half in the house I absolutely adored, but the second half completely lost me.  The end result was so much more unsettling than the process, and the ridiculousness of her being SPOILERS YO STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS skinned alive yet somehow still not dead and the pseudo-philosophical bollocks just annoyed me."
horror,3c97wj,rd_drgn67,3,Mon Jul 6 13:37:58 2015 UTC,"Literally just finished watching this an hour ago.  Easily one of the most fucked up movies I've ever seen.  It starts off fucked up, it continues being fucked up, and it ends fucked up.  It makes you feel unsettled right from the very beginning and leaves you feeling unsettled after it's over.  If you're looking for a movie that makes you feel really uncomfortable without resorting to jump scares, this is the one."
horror,3c97wj,ScrmWrtr42,24,Mon Jul 6 08:47:47 2015 UTC,"Not ""scared"" - I don't think a movie has properly scared me in that sense since The Ring fucked me up as a kid - but hit me like a punch in the gut? Funny Games. I went into it with no idea what to expect, and what I got wasn't so much scary as it was...exhausting. I can't really vocalise what it was that got me so intensely, because the content wasn't anything I hadn't seen before, but the way it was handled was just tremendously unsettling."
horror,3c97wj,Br0adzilla,7,Mon Jul 6 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"Any time someone asks me about a movie that scared me, I have to explain to them that the 2007 version Funny Games takes the cake. I wasn't scared by it but the overall feeling of uneasiness that it left me in really made it memorable for me. I totally understand what you are saying!"

horror,3c97wj,JonnyLumberjack,9,Mon Jul 6 03:46:23 2015 UTC,"The evil dead remake had a very grotesque and twisted sense of fun behind all the ultraviolence. I think it set a very good tone for an evil dead film, but it doesn't sit well as a pure horror flick."
horror,3c97wj,NecronomiconExMortis,3,Mon Jul 6 08:14:27 2015 UTC,are they ever going to make the second part? I loved the first one
horror,3c97wj,ScaryKerry91476,21,Mon Jul 6 10:13:06 2015 UTC,"'The Taking of Deborah Logan'. I was late to see this one, but it is definitely at the top of the 'found footage' crop."

horror,3c97wj,TomViolence,7,Mon Jul 6 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"I remember the first movie that really scared me as a kid was Event Horizon. I had seen Friday the 13th movies, Freddy, halloween etc. but Event Horizon really shook me.  Then recently I just watched Creep on a suggestion from a friend. Didn't look it up or read anything about so I went in cold and it got me all anxious and freaked out.  And I don't really like found footage."

I guess that put me in an emotionally vulnerable state because a scene at the end caused me to cry. I broke down and sobbed.

horror,3c97wj,Duck-Schmuck,2,Mon Jul 6 13:25:35 2015 UTC,I regret watching it with my wife. It was the movie that made her nope out of watching horrors with me because she said if they're getting that extreme she just can't handle them any more.
horror,3c97wj,Bloodbather,7,Mon Jul 6 16:39:19 2015 UTC,We Are Still Here (2015)... really scary
horror,3c97wj,cjswitz,3,Mon Jul 6 04:12:01 2015 UTC,I really liked the way the movie started. It built up the story and tension well but then the story just kind of imploded.  It didn't make sense who the ghosts killed and didn't. The son and girlfriend were killed why? Then the family friends but the main couple was spared?  If they needed to sacrifice people to the house why didn't they just kill them immediately? If it was related to avoiding the house why did the whole town eventually break in?  I wanted to like this movie but it just fell apart.
horror,3c97wj,Bloodbather,8,Mon Jul 6 14:26:10 2015 UTC,"Inland Empire. It's not a horror movie, but it's David Lynch being creepy and surreal and baffling and very, very unsettling....for 3 hours."

Now it doesn't do it for me but I can appreciate what it did for me at the time.  Something that always makes me genuinely uncomfortable is Misery. Kathy Bates just freaks me out now."
horror,3c97wj,vanessow,8,Mon Jul 6 02:35:49 2015 UTC,I loved the Babadook. The movie just made me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know how else to put it.

horror,3c97wj,pantoponrosey,7,Tue Jul 7 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"The ending of babadook?  Without spoiling too much, I think everything we see after the basement scene with her son is just in her mind.  Thinking of it that way makes the rest of the movie make a lot more sense."

The thought of a serial killer being quite literally the personification of the devil is quite unsettling.  He lures people in to the point where they're close friends with him, dating him, etc.  Then he just kills them.  So unsettling to think of how deceptive someone can be.  Fantastic cinematography helps with the scares too.  The show is very artistic.  I love it."

There was some real goofy shit that could have turned almost slapstick but it remained connected to reality somehow. I feel like Sam Raimi is the only one that can pull off horror slapstick and i cringe when others attempt it. Luckily Tusk didn't venture into that territory like a lot of horror comedies do and remained more dark and the humor more grounded.

I may be in the minority, but I thought the movie did a pretty awful job of portraying the events in the book. Yes, the idea of child abuse is absolutely abysmal and to imagine that children could be so easily persuaded/manipulated to do such terrible acts is also quite a disturbing thought. That being said, the acting, even for a b-movie, is atrocious. They do an awful job of any sort of character building. There really isn't any gruesome torture shown, it's mainly implied and done off screen. It has this cheesy made for TV feel to it. Check the trailer.  To be honest, I keep thinking that with all the praise this movie gets that I watched a different version than everyone else. Or, I'm just a soulless robot."

horror,3c97wj,Sparkmovement,3,Mon Jul 6 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"TMC holds up, and will continue to do so, after literally decades. It's one of the few horror movies that having young people in it and doesn't detract from the quality. Most horror movies that are scary have adults in them these days, and all the teens are all from Planet Beautiful which takes it out of it. Nope, easy top 10 favourites. Love love love that movie. I was at a nerd shop and I over heard a Chad type talking about the movie to his Chad-esque gf and she lamented ""all the people getting killed with chainsaws"" and I just HAD to but in like a buttinski to correct them both. Territories is a return to that, young people who run afoul bad dudes. Cept these bad dudes are victims themselves of the industrial military complex, much like the Sawyers from TMC were affected by the mechanization of their livelihoods.  Interesting baddies that have layers and motive to them are always better. Sometimes the baddies in Territories are downright touching when interacting together. I would ameliorate my previous statement by say Territories is a love letter to Texas Chainsaw Massacre."

I saw it in theatres first and it was scary but not enough to make me not watch it again when my sisters girlfriend rented it. There were extra scenes on the VHS copy and at the end after she comes out of the TV you see her face (which I didn't see in the theatre version). I was so not prepared for that! It's taken me years to get over that image and even thinking of it or seeing it randomly still freaks me out.

If you go into the audition and are boring and meek, you're not going to make an impression. That being said, going bat-shit crazy the whole time isn't exactly the best either. Be creepy but subtle and then let out the scare when the audition folks are least expecting it.  I wouldn't be nervous about it because YOU get to be in control. Remember how fun it is to be scared because a scare-actor got the jump on you?  Now you'll be the one doing it!

horror,3cdr6k,daveyhalloween,8,Tue Jul 7 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. It's a well-made movie and I enjoyed the score and tone, but I don't know, the characters didn't really hold my attention. The general ""if you have sex, then it'll follow you!"" plot was eh... bland, IMO. Just felt like a zombie movie at times. If we could get a movie with ghostly figures in it that looked like something other than recently-deceased people, I'd be all over that."
horror,3cdr6k,bpainsickbrain,4,Tue Jul 7 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"Ah man well for me just the idea alone was one of the more original and creepy horror plots to come around these days.  From the first scene with the girl running out in the street and the music setting the tone had me hooked. Also, it didn't rely on the jump scares or the found footage idea to get the scares. Instead it gave you a pure constant threat of uneasiness. Is that the monster? maybe that's the monster? oh shit there's the monster! haha.   Another great thing to me was the characters. In It follows we actually got to fall in love with a cast of charters that had you rooting for them! So many times in current horror you could give a shit less what happens to the characters because they are snobby bitches and jocks that deserve whats coming to them. Here on the other hand we had a solid badass group of kids that took matters into their own hands when coming across some pretty gnarly shit.  All around I think it got all the hype it needed. Did well on the indie market then got a chance to get in some select theaters.  Also, about a month ago I had a dream that this shit happened to me and it was scary as hell!!"
horror,3cdr6k,uhhhphilip,10,Tue Jul 7 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"It Follows is a great movie in my opinion. The atmosphere is fantastic, it gave me a creepy impending sense of doom. Everything worked for me, the acting, the cinematography, the dialogue and even the lack of dialogue in certain moments. The soundtrack was also really good and helped set the tone of the film. But in the end it's just an opinion. A large majority of this sub loved Starry Eyes and I absolutely hated it."
horror,3cdr6k,Dasklown,2,Tue Jul 7 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think It Follows was scary but I did feel it was creepy. I liked the idea of there being no adults in the film and the time frame being ambiguous. I like the idea of being stalked, and that you'd see them coming in the background so it was always wise not to look at actors while they talked.  It's an allegory for AIDS or something.  Let's see what the director does in the next installment."
horror,3cdr6k,SwampTerror,4,Tue Jul 7 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't think it was all that either. Solid for sure, but not a modern classic. I felt the film had a good sense of atmosphere and overall suspense, but came up a little lacking as far as the real paranoia was concerned. Specifically, it became too obvious whenever ""it"" was about to attack. If the film had played a little more with the creature approaching with little to no lead-in, and assuming less obvious disguises, I think it could have gone up in my rating.  I think a lot of the love for the film tends to come from it having an original monster and a good soundtrack (things a lot of contemporary horror is sorely lacking)."
horror,3cdr6k,ArabiaFats,5,Tue Jul 7 04:07:49 2015 UTC,I thought it had a great creepy vibe but fell short of being worthy of all the praise. I don't think it 'stuck' the landing with the ending. And I thought it was sorely missing at least one great and gory on screen death.

horror,3cdr6k,ToxicBronson,2,Tue Jul 7 05:53:42 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite film of the year so far  It just really clicked with me overal, the tone, the story, the use of shots, the scare factor, kids being the protaganists, the underlining story, it's symbolism and of course the amazing soundtrack witch adds a lot  I have only seen it in theatre, I don't dare to see it on the blu ray I bought because I'm afraid it works best watching it in a theatre."
horror,3cdr6k,DarkmanBeyond,2,Tue Jul 7 06:52:57 2015 UTC,"The cinematography and score both recall classic-era Carpenter, and do it effectively (which I've never once seen accomplished outside of actual Carpenter movies). The concept is cool, and combines what works about haunting and zombie movies. It's the first time in quite a while that we've gotten a new monster with a clear set of rules, like vampires or Freddy Kruger. The kids feel real; they are flawed but also trying to be good people and do what's right, and they mumble around their emotions authentically. I think all of those things should be easily recognized as commendable by any horror fan. Also, for me personally, it scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen (and I've easily seen hundreds). I understand that last part will not be the same for everybody. Scares are subjective. But it shouldn't be too hard to understand why others love the film so much."
horror,3cdr6k,sadstork,2,Tue Jul 7 10:19:28 2015 UTC,"I loved the concept, the tone and the soundtrack. I also loved the fact that they didn't over explain it, nothing annoys me more than the way most modern commercial horrors explain every last detail as if the audience are idiots. Leaving something to the imagination is part of what makes something scary!  The one thing I didn’t like was the whole sex element, for me, the way the curse was passed on could have done with a bit more thought. Transmitting via sex felt lazy....  Overall a good solid 8/10"

It had its down moments but it was a really well made film that was a breath of fresh air for me.   I wasn't scared, but im not really scared by many movies anymore.  Honestly, i feel the backlash comes from the hype. If you had no idea about this movie and saw it you probably would of enjoyed it more. But when everyone around you is saying it is a masterpiece or ""the scariest film you will see"" it builds up crazy expectations that no film can surpass."
horror,3cdr6k,sgtcoolbeans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"I quite liked it but I didn't find it particularly scary. It was more like a sci-fi IMO. I really liked the music, I liked the originality and the timeless quality, it could have been set in the 70's or the 2000's. I liked the way they didn't tell you anything about the monster - it didn't have an origin or an explanation. All the best movie monsters are mysterious like that."

I was planning on watching Zombeavers tonight. The Canal was my third film in, and I really enjoyed it. I haven't seen it yet but Cabin Fever: Patient Zero is on my list. The director's previous feature length film is one of my favorite B-Movie Horrors call Altitude, so I am hoping it doesn't suck."
horror,3cbtab,darlingdeer9,2,Mon Jul 6 21:56:03 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Doing this little experiment has opened my eyes to how biased I can personally be toward a horror movie I have never even seen.  I didn't hate Patient Zero but I just kind of felt it strayed too far from the first two. Zombeavers is pretty great in it's own right. After reading your list I am definitely putting Lake Mungo and Altered on my list now!

They actually shot it in a building where a bunch of political activists and squatters were living.  They traded them laptops and stuff for being allowed to shoot there.  The way time was manipulated worked out so great but the writer had to get some help for it to turn out just right."

horror,3cac1b,Myerla,2,Mon Jul 6 10:02:30 2015 UTC,"It's a decent British ghost story with one or two good moments (while since I've seen it), but it's no where near as creepy or chilling as the Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), which I'd argue is one of the best films (if not the best) of the haunted house sub genre."
horror,3cac1b,sdcinerama,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:13:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the source novel, HELL HOUSE is the best haunted house book ever, by one of the best horror writers ever, who also wrote a fairly faithful script.  So the bones of the piece are impeccable. Unfortunately... It never firms up to the masterpiece it should have been. I think the director played it a little too straight when he should have gone for a weird twisted vibe.  I don't often hope something gets remade, but this is one I hope gets a remake from a production team with a feel for horror.  And Belasco House is in New England. Matheson is American. Some of the cast may be British, but it is NOT a British picture (though it's an easy mistake to make)."
horror,3cac1b,DoctorMystery,0,Mon Jul 6 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"I saw this movie a long time ago and don't really remember all that much of it, but I did just finish the book the other week and enjoyed it. Does anyone know if there are vast differences between the two?"
horror,3cac1b,horrorinpureform,0,Mon Jul 6 12:09:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like it all that much...the setup is decent but it doesn't deliver any good scares, the performances are pretty phoney, and I hated the way the plot developed in the last 20 minutes of the film, it was so cheesy. Seen it once and would never have the desire to revisit it."
horror,3cac1b,this_ismy_alias,0,Mon Jul 6 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"I've never read the book, so I am judging the movie as a stand-alone. I think that Hell House was as much a suspense as it was a horror film. The time between discoveries or events was spent developing the characters, which I feel is lacking in many haunted house movies.   If this movie had been made with this same style at any other time than the 70s I probably would not have liked it. But, remembering the ""pace"" of the 70s movies, I think that Hell house was well done. The acting was admittedly somewhat over the top, but again considering the decade, I think it's forgivable. Roddy McDowall was particularly memorable.  I enjoyed it enough to buy the dvd. Nostalgia probably plays a large part in why I like this movie as well :) ."

horror,3ca56w,un1cornbl00d,7,Mon Jul 6 08:18:43 2015 UTC,"The House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski I liked this so much I bought my own hard cover special edition. No cult but eerie with events and occurrences bleeding over from an almost urban legend story into the life of the protagonist researching it. However both stories are fully fleshed out. You could pull the book apart and have two complete books. Finally there are miniature stories and notes encoded into the main text (such as with different fonts or colours or word spacings ) as well as scattered in the margins such as with morse codes. Its great fun to read if you like finding all these little things and its impressive that it all came together  given how much extra work this is.   Flicker by Theodore Roszak I was recommended this because of HoL. I didnt like it anywhere as much but hey an actual cult for you. Bonus points if you are a movie buff as this book would be 1/4 shorter with all the movie name dropping and trivia removed.  A not bad if far fetched premise.   The Night Church by Whitley Strieber A more pulp fiction book that I enjoyed. A satanic church in NYC, what are the odds.  Rosemarys Baby by Ira Levin A satanic cult in NYC... Wait a minute. Ah this one is Central Park Satanists, the other is Queens Satanists. Carry on.   The Repairman Jack series by F Paul Wilson This might not be Top 50 Im not sure but it deserves to be. Its a great series and while it may seem to wander away from the main cult story line in each stories rather different settings its always there in the background guiding events to culmination.   The Odd Thomas series by Dean Koontz This is probably Top 50 but I dont know how many people know about the cult like opponents working behind the scenes against Odd. I certainly didnt know when I rented the 3rd audio book amd have since gone back to read the rest.   Honourable Mentions:  The Devil Rides Out by Dennis Wheatley English Satanists. Pip pip. What.   To the Devil a Daughter by Dennis Wheatley French Satanists. Think of it as almost a gender bent The Omen that was written first."

horror,3c7gk8,UnhappyLittleTrees,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:01:58 2015 UTC,Yes!! The 28 Days Later soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece.
horror,3c7gk8,UnhappyLittleTrees,14,Mon Jul 6 05:00:13 2015 UTC,"The Shining. Krysztof Penderecki and György Ligeti are my two favorite composers, and their work makes up the backbone of the film, and really genre film music in general. It's interesting to think how despite having never written a film score themselves, their concert music has had a more profound impact on the sound of horror post-1960 than possibly any other composer. And it's not just how often pieces like Ploymorphia or the second movement of Ligeti's Requiem have been used in classic sci fi and horror movies- think of how much original film music deliberately tries to imitate the techniques they pioneered."
horror,3c7gk8,Overlooker,3,Sun Jul 5 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"It's not just those two. Early film music is heavily inspired by Debussy and Stravinsky, not just by directly using their pieces, but by paying homage to them all around. I've always been more of a minimalist kind-of-guy than a micro-polyphony type, but Ligeti and Penderecki are very, very good.  As you say the horror scores are heavily influenced by them. I mean my favourite horror score (It Follows) is heavily inspired by especially Ligeti. I like it when ""classical"" music is given to people in settings where they don't think about it."
horror,3c7gk8,HBKF,5,Sun Jul 5 22:24:29 2015 UTC,I've always found it interesting to see how much more open people are to avant garde music when they aren't told it's avant garde.

My first horror soundtrack was Hans Zimmer's The Ring. And of course, Johan Soderqvist's score to Let the Right One In is unquestionably one of my favorites because I'm obsessed with that movie/book.  So yeah... those ones...  Edit: Forgot to add ""why."" WELL same reason for all of the ones I mentioned, I guess: they provide the perfect atmosphere for me while I'm writing or making art. They're equal parts beautiful, dark, and unsettling. I love me some dark piano + strings tunes."

horror,3c7gk8,footBand,3,Mon Jul 6 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"I love classical, and Hanz Zimmer's The Ring is beautiful, especially ""The Well"" and ""This Is Going to Hurt."" I actually mix them in with the rest of my classical playlist.  But this soundtrack is specifically my favorite because while it is evocative, it is not too obviously a horror soundtrack. It is aesthetically pleasing, but there is a gradually increasing undercurrent of...""wrongness.""   It starts out quite mellow, although I think the fact that it stays with pieces that have one or two instruments only (usually just strings, a flute, or piano), emphasize the isolation that is a central theme of the actual story. It gradually amps up the use of minor key tonality (...okay, I did steal that term from Pandora) and synthetic qualities (synthesized sounds, static, etc). The tempos also gradually increase, feeling more frantic (as if time is ""running out."") There are also some recurring instrumental themes that manage, for me at least, to evoke the idea of ""water"" - which is an obvious choice.  The Ring soundtrack is creepy, but fairly subtle. It follows the story it's telling, but is an interesting thread in itself."
horror,3c7gk8,mindtapped,2,Sun Jul 5 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"I like Hans Zimmer, especially his influence from Strauss, which is where he got the ""aesthetically pleasing, but with a wrongness"" from. It's not a horror score, but my favourite score of his has to be Interstellar. I love organ music, and he used it really really well.  A snob would argue that Hans Zimmer isn't classical because film music differs vastly from other ""classical"" music. I'd argue they were somewhat wrong, especially about Interstellar. The Ring has more of a movie-feel to it (not a bad thing). As a musicologist I really appreciate both worlds (they're not always THAT different)."
horror,3c7gk8,Severen4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"While I love classical in just about all its forms, it's essentially an amateur's love. I've been exposed to a lot of it (I go to operas fairly often, as well as musicals and the occasional symphony), but except for playing an instrument up to the high school level, I haven't had any formal education in it. I like a lot of it, but I don't have the language to really say why or what precisely I like about it, or the breadth of specific knowledge to say whose music reminds me of whose.

I have a cut of ROTLD that includes deleted footage but doesn't have the score....just the music they used while working on it. And it kind of sucks. Everything seems a bit jarring and the movie actually suffers. Linnea Quigley dancing, Frank crawling into the cremation oven.....they did an amazing job of linking the music to the action while keeping the ambiance of 80's punk and never once do they fall back on a score written just for that film.

My other half and I were lucky to see him twice in London - once when he performed some of his Etudes, and once for a 4 hour marathon performance of the whole of Music in Twelve Parts with the rest of the Philip Glass Ensemble (which required two fifteen minute breaks and one hour-long break for the audience/performers to stretch their legs!). He's so good, and I was properly fangirling over seeing him - like I was at some kind of superband rock gig or something! I always mean to download more of his stuff, but money ;)"

I didn't really like him at first, because I had my own little war in my head going between Glass and Steve Reich, and I was (and am) more a fan of Reich than of Glass. There's no denying it though, he is one of the best composers of our time. Everything from Candyman to the older Music With Changing Parts, is really great.

horror,3c7ena,_Swae_,2,Mon Jul 6 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"Way too predictable. As soon as we saw the Peach Fuzz mask and he blurted out the line about having an axe at the house I knew exactly how the film was going to end. I watched it twice and I'm really struggling to find any redeeming qualities with this film.  I just don't see what everyone else is seeing. But then again I think We Are Still Here and Starry Eyes were vastly superior to It Follows and The Babadook.  Maybe I just have strange taste, but this one is at the bottom of the barrel with Apollo 18 for me..."

horror,3c5phy,clangerhammer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:48:17 2015 UTC,Really? As much as I disliked the first one I thought the tie in was really well done
horror,3c5phy,fadeout101,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:57:23 2015 UTC,I thought it took away from the characters and their own story. It made it a child-piece of the main films rather than something that can stand on its own. If you haven't seen the others then the end makes zero sense.

horror,3c5phy,sweaterkiller,5,Sun Jul 5 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree on saying not to watch Insidious Chapter 2 or The Marked Ones. The second Insidious wasn't as great as the first or latest but it still was a lot better than cheesy horror comedies like the Leprechaun.   The Marked Ones falls in a similar boat, as it wasn't as good as the first, but it actually did the series from a pretty different standpoint and it had a really interesting story with a satisfying ending unlike the last two. It's got me pretty excited to see the next one when it comes out.  I'm glad to see others liked Devil's Pass, though. It was a bit hard to follow until it clicked in the last act, which gave it an awesome impact. It wasn't a sudden mindbender, but more gradual and everything came together so perfectly. If I were to add any to this list, it'd be something like Banshee Chapter, The Taking of Deborah Logan, The Babadook, and maybe World War Z because it was pretty damn good even if it had ol' Brad in it."

As a fan of the series I was pretty disappointed with the end to say the least.  There were supposed to be 8 films though so I can see how trying to put 2 movies into 1 can cause problems."

The story is good too. I think the movie could have been even better if they didn't give up their chance to play with ambiguity - they should have made you question whether there were real ""rune powers"", or if it was all a hoax and intimidation by suggestion as the main character believed. If they hadn't shown the demon in the very opening scene, it would have been much more successful on that front.   Still, one of the best horror films from the 50s, I revisit it every few years."

Although there are a few elements of satire within the story, it is generally very dark, and in almost every part it shows the majority of evil comes from the human characters rather then those of the Pit (And there is a great deal of Evil shown). The extent to which our world is able to carry on (and profit) once the Pit comes to Earth is also tested well beyond breaking point, resulting in a truer apocalypse. All that being said, I do love the idea of Ugly Americans ;-)"

horror,3c4hhw,MyUserNameTaken,2,Sun Jul 5 04:58:26 2015 UTC,So burned through this as I had been looking for something to read while the SF book club subreddit finishes voting.  I liked the concept and definite kudos for keeping the religious overtones out of it.  Given the subject matter I suspect that that was not easy to do.  I got a bit of WWZ vibe from the fact that each chapter was mostly a self contained story with the continuity done through references and asides.  The world building was just enough to keep me interested and left enough unsaid that I felt I could identify with the characters as to never really knowing what was going on.  And the world is self is very visceral.  Definitely not something that I would be at all interested in experiencing.  So I liked it.  Definitely felt it was an evening and day well spent.

It's just an obstacle. A smart killer will figure out ways to work around it or use it to their advantage. We need more tech-savvy slashers and fewer hydrocephalic brutes.

horror,3c6bc8,hihoberiberi,4,Sun Jul 5 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"Writer David Schow was recently on Killer P.O.V. and this topic came up. If I remember correctly, he cited movie The Hills Run Red as an example of a slasher movie where the cell phone works but is of no help and, as I recall, the killer calls the victim's cell and when it rings, he uses the ring in order to figure out where he is hiding.  I've never seen ""Hills Run Red"" but one of the hosts of the show made the point that slasher movies might now have to be period pieces where modern technology didn't exist or they have to have the line explaining why technology isn't working in the area the story takes place.  Schow made the case that someone with a fresh approach will figure out how to use modern technology in a slasher movie where it's completely useless for getting help and it's used against the victims in new and interesting ways."

horror,3c6bc8,TheVeldt323,3,Tue Jul 7 08:10:37 2015 UTC,"I think that yes, slashers can still makes sense. For example if the movie takes place in a small, contained area in just one night, the killer wouldn't need to think about the cops while killing. Some examples are: You're Next, The Collector, The Strangers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Funny Games etc.  Of course there are more ways and this is just an example but I think that a slasher would be possible to watch if we can watch a ghost movie without dismissing it because of the fact that ghosts don't exist."

I'm shaking like a leaf thinking about it. I never left those blinds open again.

The movie was made in response to people that look up stuff like terrorist beheadings and murders on film as a recreational activity.

horror,3c3a56,lodi_,2,Sun Jul 5 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"Probably, depending what you consider torture porn. It's not packed with special effects gore like Hostel is, but the tapes are all of people being tortured and killed."
horror,3c3a56,theenigma31680,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I went into it with no expectations and came out of it with little.  I really didn't care for it that much, maybe it was the docu style or found footage style, (both of which don't really excite me much) but it just didn't work for me.  I'm not saying it was a bad film, for what it was made to do, it did its job.  I just don't really care enough about it for a rewatch."

horror,3c3a56,Darklink478,7,Sat Jul 4 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"It's just a different type of found footage movie is all. When you say found footage you start thinking of some of the big ones Blairwitch, REC, Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters, Last Exorcism, etc etc. They all deal with something supernatural or out of the protagonist's control. This one is made more for the serial killer fan and from several point of views (law enforcement and then the killer himself.) It's even made in the format of some Forensic Files style special. There's a decent mix of eerie and off putting scenes from his tapes and the interviews that show the strange and taboo adoration people have for serial killers with the 'experts.'   It's ultimately just a good film because it leaves you feeling a bit uneasy if you can get into the atmosphere it creates. I've always found a solid home invasion movie to be most effective against myself, so the whole Cheryl Dempsey abduction chapter just raises the hairs on the back of my neck."
horror,3c3a56,sutherbland,3,Sat Jul 4 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I found myself enjoying it because it addressed the aftermath as well as the actual events of the film and presented so many different perspectives on what happened and why (friends, family, psychologists, etc.).  I feel like it satisfied my craving for something ""different,"" it felt sort of like Bowling for Columbine, Twin Peaks, and a torture porn all mixed into one awesome experience rather than just a run-of-the-mill gorefest."
horror,3c3a56,xxlukiferxx,-1,Sat Jul 4 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"Nono, i understand that its a different type of found footage. I just legitimately thought it was a crappy movie. There was soooo much hype about it 8 years ago when it came out. Then it turned out to be a disappointment for me."

I didn't enjoy the last broadcast, but I watched it about 10 years ago so maybe I'll give it another whirl.  I thought lake mungo was great.   I dunno, maybe when it first became available so many years ago, I got too excited and expected something more. I cant really come up with a valid response, other than i just didn't care for it.

Plus the cast is GREAT! Barbara Crampton and Larry Fessenden!   Scream TV Show (2015)  I uh...surprisingly didn't hate this like I was afraid I would.  Had some good in jokes to the original flick and the new format.  Was a bit more violent that I expected for MTV.  Really, it left me looking forward to the next ep to see where they go with it.   Spookies (1986) I've been wanting to see this since the 80's and never got around to it until now.  It's a lot of fun!  It's also super cheesy!  But that's part of the appeal.  The story is bog standard, but the make up and effects are a blast if 80's horror is your thing!"
horror,3c40a2,gooch2k2,3,Sat Jul 4 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"The Virgin Spring (1960)  In 14th Century Sweden, a young girl is raped and murdered by drifters while on the way to deliver candles to a church.  The drifters later seek refuge at the home of the girl's parents.  Max von Sydow plays the father, who finds out what the men had done and exacts his revenge.  Apparently this is common knowledge, but I didn't realize until watching this that Craven/Cunningham's Last House on the Left is heavily inspired by this.  This Ingmar Bergman film won an Oscar for Best Foreign FIlm.  Gappa (1967) A group of explores find an egg that hatches a prehistoric creature on an island and bring it back to Japan to study.  Mom and Dad awake from hibernation and track their baby back to Japan and destroy cities while they're at it. The Gappa are ""triphibeous"" bird-like creatures, who walk, swim and fly.  Not bad for a non Toho or Daiei kaju.    The Boneyard (1991) A cop and a psychic get stuck in a morgue when some bodies come back to life and attack.  Phylis Diller and Norman Fell play the morgue attendant and coroner.  I found it dull, however, the zombie make-up was pretty good.  Something about child-zombies running around had a creepy look.    I also caught up with, and finished season 2 of Salem."

It doesn't seem to really commit itself or have a tought out focus. Pretty disappointing. And to using the Doors music and lyrics was really jarring the tone of the movie."

It used to be that horror films pushed the envelope for what you could show as far as sex, gore and deprativity was concerned. Pretty much any horror classic will be rated R. You can't make something genuinely scary and have it PG-13, since PG-13 can't be ""emotionally traumatizing"" or however the MPAA puts it.   A PG-13 horror will not have swearing in it, not have sex or nudity in not, it won't have much gore or violence, and it can't be actually, genuinely scary.   But of course it might make more money in theaters if its PG-13."

The majority of remakes are pretty bad movies, but otherwise they tend to just take a concept and do something a little different and typically more modern with it. Why don't you just not see it? Haha. Evil Dead and Halloween weren't movies that needed to be improved, but were remade into totally different and in some folks' opinion great movies. Suspiria's kinda the same deal.

The acting is wooden and it looks like the budget was even lower than it actually was.  ED2013, however, remains one of my go to horror films, especially given the practical effects. The casting was well done, the gore was top notch, and it had a female protagonist that had actual flaws, not female flaws.

However, he is good at that one role, and I think he would work much better for Phibes than Johnny Depp, who also always plays the same role (with a few notable exceptions).  I look forward to a scary/creepy remake of the Mummy, and also to American Werewolf in London and Hellraiser."

The original's greatness is so closely tied with its music and cinematography that the remake would be a completely different movie without a director whose visual sensibilities are at least as outlandish.

Up to that point in the film , every time the shark is on screen that iconic music is playing. You begin to associate that music with the shark so if you hear the music, you know the shark is about. Then when the shark pops up out of the water with no music to announce it's arrival, the jump scare is much more effective.

So much of Death Proof is unlikable women written to talk like guys.  It was so hard to slog through all of that and get up to Kurt Russel's appearance.

Plus, I think it's always hard to trust a review from someone if you don't know their taste in horror. I tend to like either absolutely off-the-wall comedy horror (like ""Zombeavers"") or super serious scary foreign horror (like ""[Rec]"" or ""The Orphanage"") - if that helps place my review in context."

Someone below suggested maybe it was a surveillance camera and he was tapped into her computer that way.    Another suggestion was Strangeland which looks very, very, similar but I'm not sure if it's that or not, I'll have to watch it to be sure.  In the trailer for Strangeland it shows Dee Snider on the webcam, the movie I am thinking of, the video camera was just like that, all choppy and laggy."

Did the killer turn out to be another woman who was in a building across the street at first, and eventually goes into the blonde woman's apartment trying to kill her? And I think the woman who is being spied on had a little kid as well?"

horror,3bxr8a,horrorinpureform,15,Fri Jul 3 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would have a hard time coming up with 60 ""great"" horror films in existence, much less on Netflix.  At least half or more of those I consider ""great"" they don't even have."
horror,3bxr8a,BurnetRhoades,2,Fri Jul 3 04:59:41 2015 UTC,Those first few all had so many comments about how bad they were that I thought I misread the title and it was a 60 worst films list. Then I saw White Zombie and The Dunwich Horror and got confused by why they were on the list.
horror,3bxr8a,SoulFire6464,2,Fri Jul 3 12:13:57 2015 UTC,But isn't that the interesting thing about horror.  It's the fact that some people defend Phantasm 1 to the death while others claim the series doesn't start until Phantasm 2.  They are very different films with very different feels.  Depending on who you ask one is a master piece and one is garbage.  It's just something unique the horror movie genre give us.
horror,3bxr8a,JohnnyKaboom,2,Fri Jul 3 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"That's not unique to the horror genre, but some of these are just bad for most viewers, not just for a minority/half. I mean I don't know anyone who likes the remake of the Haunting, or ABCs of Death, or Silent House (god that is one of the worst remakes of all)...maybe people who derive some tiny ounce of pleasure from those movies exist, but would they really claim they are ""great"" movies?"
horror,3bxr8a,horrorinpureform,2,Fri Jul 3 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"The first ABC's of death has some great segments, (F is for Fart comes to mind or T is for Toilet) the remake of the Haunting works because it comes back around the ""it's so bad it's good"" curve.  Don't get me wrong  You have to have a certain pallet to enjoy stuff like Troll 2, but Horror for some inexplicable reason, fosters that.  There's a reason Alien Apocalypse is to good even though it's about wood eating aliens.  There's a reason Dead and Breakfast is a cult hit, or take a look at Monster in the Closet by Troma.  Bad horror films are awesome.    However, I'd like to give credence to a sub-point you're making.  When you make a list you need to define great.  Mixing so bad it's great, with great leads to a highly debatable list and a really uneven viewing experience.  So I dig what you're getting at, I respectfully disagree, but I respect your opinion and reasoning."
horror,3bxr8a,JohnnyKaboom,2,Fri Jul 3 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"I agree ABCs of Death has some good segments (For me that would be A is for Apocalypse and maybe X and T...) but that's like 5% of the movie, the rest is near-unwatchable. And I am personally a ""so bad it's good"" aficionado myself but I don't find that The Haunting remake gets there, it stays in the ""so bad it's bad"" category for me personally, and I didn't even know other people saw it as a worthy B-movie.   I totally get what you're saying though, this is just an illogically mixed list of movies that are really bad and not a lot of people will find even entertaining (nothing here is Troll 2 or the Room quality for me sadly, it's just failed cheesefests), and some actual great horror films."

I feel like they're at least trying to stick to slasher clichés and paying some homage to the original Scream, but to me, the characters leave much to be desired. Unlike in the Scream movies, I'm having a hard time caring about any of the characters, save for Noah.  I'll keep watching it just to see how things turn out, but overall, I'm really disappointed with what MTV has decided to do with this show."

Also, it manifests as her husband, who died in a horrifically traumatic car accident that she witnessed and which was a catalyst for her descent into a deeper and deeper depression. That was what really did it for me."

I would call the original Saw one of my favourite movies, and while the others wouldn't rate anything like that, I have no reservations about saying that I enjoy the later movies. They're fun and I enjoy re watching them every so often, because it's kind of cathartic.  Speaking generally, the movies all offer varying degrees of creative traps, twisty endings, detective drama and high body counts, and that's not to mention the consisten plot running through them all (even though the plot hole tally grew quickly over time). I really enjoy the acknowledgement of the hypocrisy of the ""jigsaw"" killers, because I love when villains see themselves as honourable but they're really just sociopathic hypocrites."

horror,3bz7ih,BigGreenYamo,2,Fri Jul 3 13:12:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the second one, and the third was alright.  The rest, I completely confuse for each other. Not to say that I don't enjoy the whole series, but the last 4 are just completely interchangeable."

horror,3bz7ih,JeanRalfio,6,Sun Jul 5 00:12:51 2015 UTC,When it first came out I had no idea what it was about and man was it everything I didn't know I wanted. I then saw every one of the rest of the movies in theaters. I knew they were dropping in quality with each one but it was such a interwoven story that I had to see them and still enjoyed them all.
horror,3bz7ih,el_pookiez,6,Fri Jul 3 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"I saw this in a crowded theater on opening night. There was a man sitting next to me who would cringe and gasp at some of the scenes throughout the movie. His reactions were more entertaining than they were annoying, I guess because he was vocalizing how I was feeling, but at the very end when that big reveal happened, this guy stood up and yelled ""MOTHERFUCKER!"" Then he sat back down and asked me in a loud whisper, ""Did you see that motherfucker? Did you know he was gonna be there? HOLY SHIT!""   All I could do was laugh.   It was a fantastic movie to see in the theater and I'm really glad I got to see it in that environment, even with the guy next to me. I still consider it one of my favorite movie theater memories."
horror,3bz7ih,voice-of-unreason,9,Sat Jul 4 00:25:16 2015 UTC,"I first 'Saw' (ha ha) this in a tiny little theater in a dodgy part of down town Minneapolis... it certainly added to the atmosphere.   People love to write it off as 'torture porn' and while its been years since I've seen it, IIRC the gore was pretty mild in the flash back scenes (reverse bear trap, burning alive, ect.)  with most of it being implied rather than shown. It was pretty well written too, very tense throughout, and maybe I'm just easy to impress but I was genuinely surprised by the ending."
horror,3bz7ih,poland626,3,Fri Jul 3 10:29:18 2015 UTC,I saw the 10th anniversary recently and it does have less gore than I remembered. Its definitely a Texas Chainsaw Massacre situation. Kinda cool seeing it happen in modern times
horror,3bz7ih,lumpiestprincess,3,Sat Jul 4 00:26:10 2015 UTC,"As a hater of torture porn - I loved the original Saw. It was creative and original and while I was cringing in the theatre while I saw it, i was enthralled. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I was honestly scared by it.  I liked it enough that I saw the second and third movies in theatres, though I enjoyed neither of them nearly as much. By the end of the third  (along with some clones) I realized my hate of the genre, while still respecting and enjoying the orginal."
horror,3bz7ih,zilpe,3,Fri Jul 3 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"Although not a bad movie I have to admit I was disappointed with it. From the trailer I was expecting a more psychological film with little to no exposition. The idea of two people waking up chained to the wall with a saw sitting between them and no idea how they got there was very intriguing to me. Similar to films like cube where the appeal is seeing how the characters react to a completely surreal situation they have no understanding of. Instead it was really more of a thriller. The intricate and elaborate ""games"" were always kinda interesting though and probably the only reason I watched the whole series."

For the record, I like 'Deborah Logan' but the plot was not great.  I think it's more accurate to say it had a great set-up.  The Alzheimers doc was the perfect excuse for the found footage and set the stage well.  However, the actual plot was a pretty cliche sequence of:   Deborah wanders off at night Crew goes and finds her doing some sort of creepy back-to-the-camera horror trope. Repeat with increasingly spooky places to find her  3b. throw a little girl into the mix because why not?  They're creepy right?"

I agree with most of his concerns, I think he broadly has good solutions, but I also think he's talking mostly about American pop-horror, and the comparisons he chooses sometimes ignore the fact that earlier decades featured similar problems. Namely, classic and quality horror films surrounded by a variety of unengaging knockoffs and rushed cash-ins.  i.e. you can say for sure that The Exorcist delivers its shocks to better effect than a Saw movie, but you can't call this difference a meaningful sign of the times, because The Exorcist was anomalous for its day. Wiki the list of 1973 horror films - there are some good ones, but there's a lot we've collectively chosen to ignore for their faults as stories and sources of scares.

One for The Nightmare On Elm Street franchise, one for the Friday the 13th series and one for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. They were extremely well done and illustrated. I have one of each but I know there's plenty more out there.   Also, Hack/Slash is one of my favorite series at the moment.   Edit: Alrighty, after having a little looksie, I found that New Line Cinema did create the horror comics line HOWEVER, they were released through Avatar press. So you can only find those comics through searching by Avatar Press. These are hard as hell to locate but were easy after finding out about that.

All the cheesy Big Brother stuff is necessary for the social commentary the series tries to make near the end. I think we need to see Pippa being a doofus and Grayson being a drama queen because it's saying something about the people that go on these shows and the people who watch them.  Cutting most of Patrick, the producer, is completely unnecessary. We need to see how selfish and boorish he is early on to explain his motives later on. Otherwise it just looks like he is a complete looney from the get go instead of a narcissist that will do anything to survive.   I would recommend the edit if you only want all the horror and gore but really 30 minutes is a lot to sacrifice in such a short series."

I was so scared when the movie ended that I didn't even want to move from where I was cowering in the corner of the couch, but I HAD to see what was on the second tape.  I remember feeling sick as I put it in the VCR.  I ran back to the couch and the tape started playing old promo trailers for the movie that were made up of the most disturbing and gruesome footage.  And then... this."

I then kept begging my parents to let me watch it for some reason.   When they refused, that's when I learned how to record stuff with the vcr. With the help of TV Guide and an alarm clock, I started getting up in the middle of the night to record horror movies and then watch them when they weren't home. That's how I saw most of the Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Puppet Master movies, and subsequently became a fan of the genre."

Well, apparently at one point, I was soooo bad, that my aunts made me watch this movie in an attempt to scare me. The plan backfired, because I ended up really liking it.

I was riveted and terrified at the same time, my Mom said I held a hand full of popcorn up to my mouth without eating it for about five minutes, before remembering to eat it. Then came The Black Hole which, while not horror per say, had the blade spinning robot of death, which sunk deep into my brain for months afterward. Then I remember a (IIRC) made for TV movie called HISSS! that scared the crap out of me. There was some movie with dogs with glowing red eyes that I saw on the late show as well.   But, what did it for me is a movie that to this day, I have not been able to find or recall what it was called. A brief synopsis of the storyline: a guy, painter, stays at creepy hotel with a woman owner. For payment he paints a picture of her. Hotel catches fire and as he is trying to get her out she floats toward him, and she has flames for eyes. FLAMES FOR EYES for god's sake!!!! He runs out (with picture) and gets in his car and fleds. A cop finds him asleep behind the wheel next morning and he then describes the hotel, beautiful woman and fire to said officer, who tells him ""You mean the old Blahblah Hotel? It burned down YEARS ago!"" (Dun-dun-duuuuuh!) He offers the painting that's still in the back seat as proof, but of course, it's all burn-y melt-y. If I could find that movie/television show, the circle would be complete. Anyone out there in Redditville know of what I speak?"

IIRC One of the characters greatest fear as a child was the book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. I remember he could only read so much of the book before he had to stop. The scene that really got me was this character enters his bunk/private quarters and there's hundreds of copies of this book in his room. Every page is blank after the page he used to give up on out of fear. I don't know why that struck a chord in me like it did but I have been searching for that feeling ever since...."

He saw Steven Spielberg and figured it was a kid-friendly movie. I made it to the face-peeling scene before totally losing it lol  At one point a neighbor had rented the first two House movies and he was babysitting me while watching them. Didn't really scare me, but they're probably the earliest seeds that were planted in my mind that horror could be awesome.  It really took off though, because of From Beyond and Evil Dead 2. I'd spend at least a month every summer at my grandparent's place out in the country, and my grandparents didn't really enforce much of a curfew and were a lot more lax on what they'd let me watch.. I'd often stay up to 2 or 3 in the morning when my regular bed-time was 8pm when I was home..   There was one French station (I live in Quebec) that every summer had a couple of weeks where they'd have a horror marathon every night for two weeks; usually three movies a night, starting at 9pm to 3am when the channel would go dead until morning.. And since it was French, I never got the English titles for a lot of the movies I'd watched.. This was some time around/between 1986-1992..  Flash forward to 1996, one of the local video store chains (Video Roma) had what I called the Satan Special; 6 ""old"" movies for 6 days for $6.66. I went through the WHOLE horror section in one summer, somewhere around 240 movies, looking for From Beyond and Evil Dead 2. I found them, but by then I was hooked and just went through the whole section to see everything I possibly could."

My 7 year old self would be trying to sleep then Chucky would appear infront of my eyes right when I closed them.  The movie that 'really got me' into horror was Signs.

The production quality is great, and the commercials are a nice touch. I could see it fitting perfectly as a radio station in a GTA game.

And since I realize my criticism wasn't very constructive, I guess I just prefer the more deadpan delivery of Sammy as opposed to Ben's which seems like he's trying a bit too hard to be humorous.

horror,3bybmo,littlemonster010,5,Fri Jul 3 04:04:19 2015 UTC,"It doesn't even really count because it's not a public attraction, but the only truly scary place I've ever been to was my childhood home, which was on a wooded, secluded hill, with another house right beside it connected by a driveway.  My grandparents lived in one house and the other house was abandoned. In the early 90s before I was born, my uncle was still living with my grandparents and he woke up one day to find about a foot of snow outside, enough to close any area school. He looked out into the driveway to see a little girl dressed in clothing from a different era staring through him. After my grandfather woke up, he instructed my uncle to go outside and ask what she wanted. When he went outside, the girl wasn't there.  There were, however, footprints in the snow, leading to the front door of the abandoned house, of which my parents would move into a few years later and where I spent the first thirteen years of my life. I experienced a lot of odd shit here, mostly apparitions and noises; my mother also once claimed to see a man with a goat's head in the yard.  I wish I fully understood what that place was all about. Behind my grandparents old home, which mysteriously burned down this past March, is a one-step staircase leading to a pretty big rock in the side of the hill. I've always wanted to move it, but it would be pretty much impossible given how big the rock is. I feel like something is under there, and it could possibly be an old Adena Indian mound; my town notoriously destroyed those things to make way for new buildings, leading some people such as Peter Levenda to deem my city the ""geographical nexus of history,"" which is a bold claim, but I guess Charles Manson was conceived here, so that's cool."
horror,3bybmo,ElMayordomo,2,Fri Jul 3 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"The stairs from The Exorcist are just as creepy in real life.   And while I didn't get to eat there (it was unfortunately closed the day we were in the area), you can go have dinner in the house used in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: Grand Central Cafe   To add, you can stay in these old creepy ass cabins directly across the street from the Grand Central Cafe. Highly recommended for the full experience."

horror,3brp6c,eolson3,16,Wed Jul 1 18:57:55 2015 UTC,Something looks odd about this. Like it's Bruce Campbell wearing a generic Ash costume he found in a Halloween depot store & the sizing is off.  Edit: I understand the differences & what they are. It just looks... generic right now. I'm sure it'll look great when we see more.
horror,3brp6c,SiriusC,17,Wed Jul 1 16:56:51 2015 UTC,I think its in part because Bruce is a bit older and the tv series style lighting is different from the 80's horror film lighting the franchise is used to.

Ash is after all guilty of murdering his girlfriend in  a cabin, the owners of the cabin, and two people who showed up. Ranting about Deadites, books and time travel after being arrested for the shooting death of a S Mart patron. Ash's telling the truth the whole time would be immediately recognized by Hannibal. Have all the 'human' monsters patients with him; Leatherface (original TCM) and very hobbly Nubbins (Hitchiker), Drayton (Cook) Samara from 'The Ring', and perhaps the Devil's Rejects. Michael Myers is there, as serving as the Chief of our tale. Tommy from the Friday the 13th movies is there too. Leatherface and Nubbins attempt to intimidate Ash in typical prison-yard fashion, but are quickly put into line and becomes the leader of their little click. Ash basically becomes the Randall Patrick McMurphy of the hospital, but being Ash he has a 'Life of Brian' attitude to his followers.  Everyone likes Ash, Ash can't believe he is here and can't stand anyone... cept Samara. Samara confides in Ash she is suffering nightmares and being stalked by 'the burned man'. Ash doesnt like this one bit. Have Ash plagued by nightmares and attacked by Freddy, but Ash being Ash he is able to kick seven shades of shit out of the frankly confounded Freddy (put that down for Ash being 'The Chosen One' and having a host of powers and abilities that Ash is completely ignorant of). Freddy wants Samara... like WANTS Samara... and Ash basically 'dream hammers' Freddy. Freddy, though, seems heart-broken. He is spared out of disgust/ pity by Ash. Naturally, Samara being Samara, helping her is never good. Turns out there was a 'Lolita' thing going on between Freddy and Samara, where she was merely exploiting Freddy for his supernatural insights. Freddy is beside himself and decides to wreck revenge on Springwood.  Thats a start... I'd really like to see Ash fuck over the Cenobites, more for them being S&M freaks... and Jason... Jason has to have a set-to with Michael Myers...

horror,3btggv,scout_jem,0,Thu Jul 2 04:12:36 2015 UTC,There's actually not a lot of CGI blood these days because it's too hard for most of the people doing effects for horror movies.  There's a lot of fake blood elements that are photographed and then composited in rather than done in-camera.  These look fake because you can't retain the wet feeling or translucency you get with in-camera special effects blood (or well done CG blood).  There's a few collections of stock footage blood I see used all over the place and it drives me up the wall.

It's unfortunate.  It certainly makes it cheaper and easier, not having to deal with full-body hair or transformation effects using hair.

Sure the protagonist was unlikeable, but his continual offended sputtering over hippies doing hippie things was hilarious. Since I watched on YouTube, my next step is to shell out cash for a more critical re-watch (I got the impression that it was somewhat cautionary about a superstitious lifestyle on both sides, as well as containing some fucked up messages about what constitutes ""natural"" and an overwhelming attraction/repulsion to female sexuality).

It's definitely one of his greater roles, and the whole movie fills me with discomfort in a way I can't put into words. It's just off, and fantastic. I give it 9/10 fish masks.

Seems the first half of this season was all about the plague, then no one mentioned it the last few episodes, and Issac seemed cured completely.  Did they address that and I forgot?  I wasn't a fan of Mary turning her back on all she had done to save her son from, what I would consider a monumental honor.  I like her bad, and hoped she'd stay that way."

horror,3bnqr2,ewoksarecute1983,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:29 2015 UTC,I just watched this as well. Normally I have a hard time watching the mock-umentaries but I was very surprised by how well done this was. Great Netflix gem.
horror,3bnqr2,bagboyrebel,3,Tue Jun 30 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think this was the best horror movie of 2014"

horror,3bnqr2,ichabodguitar,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"I thought the merging of the time periods sort of represented the way that trauma (I thought the whole movie was about childhood trauma in general) essentially keeps you living in the past, unless you can process it.  People with PTSD relive their trauma (or traumas) over and over again, and it feels like it's happening right now, not like a memory. The emotions are just as strong during a flashback as they are when the trauma happened, which is what makes them so horrible. They happen because the brain is trying to process what happened. Those super-emotionally charged memories are sitting in the brain, mucking everything else up, so they have to be dealt with.   As the mirror's hold over the two characters got stronger, they got more and more sucked in to these flashbacks until they were completely living in the past, re-watching the trauma.  I thought the mirror was meant to represent that backwards-looking viewpoint that traumatized people can become trapped in. It's reflecting what happened (it keeps reflecting bad things that happened from centuries before.) When people die because of the mirror, their eyes become mirrors as well. I sort of took that to represent how the mirror had consumed them, and they can only see the reflection of their trauma, nothing else."
horror,3bnqr2,alucidexit,8,Tue Jun 30 20:58:32 2015 UTC,WWE Films has put out some really good movies.  No One Lives is another quality movie that I was surprised by. Check it out.
horror,3bnqr2,NakedEyeStudio,2,Wed Jul 1 16:38:32 2015 UTC,I've been telling people about No One Lives for years and nobody believes me that it's awesome...
horror,3bnqr2,selfcontortion,5,Wed Jul 1 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I have to sincerely disagree. I found this movie to be very stupid, and spent most of it's time building up a villain that could be anything it wanted to be. Laziest writing I've ever seen. It's a mirror that can do whatever it wants EVEN CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY. Why would anyone with half a brain even fuck with it? You're basically saying ""I'm going to kill God with a dull knife."" There was no logic."
horror,3bnqr2,blakewrites,2,Wed Jul 1 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree!  I expected it to be very formulaic but enjoyed the growing confusion and dark ending :)"
horror,3bnqr2,ichabodguitar,2,Wed Jul 1 07:40:41 2015 UTC,I ended up seeing a last showing of it alone (so it got out around midnight) on some weekday and had to ride my bike home in the dark.
horror,3bnqr2,Waytooboredforthis,21,Tue Jun 30 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon - Had never heard of it before (wasn't on my radar at all) and a friend recommended it to me on merits of her BF with highly doubtful taste. Was shocked by how fun and well-put-together it was. Didn't have Tucker and Dale production values, but clearly was a labor of love. Really had fun with it!"
horror,3bnqr2,wratz,3,Tue Jun 30 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it had a 4 year headstart on Tucker and Dale. Meta horror flicks gained steam after 2006, I think."

horror,3bnqr2,Annibannibee,12,Wed Jul 1 14:19:22 2015 UTC,Ugh. I felt the exact opposite. It was just what I expected. The only good thing was stuff started happening early instead of waiting till the third act.
horror,3bnqr2,TeaPoweredGames,2,Tue Jun 30 21:04:48 2015 UTC,I'm with you there. People here rave about this one but it was probably my least favorite movie I've seen in a long time. I'm glad that so many people were able to get enjoyment out of it but it did absolutely nothing for me. When it was over I felt guilty for convincing my friends to watch it with me.
horror,3bnqr2,stop_saying_content,2,Wed Jul 1 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"When they bashed the front door in and there were more hallway on the other side, I knew I was in for a ride."
horror,3bnqr2,wraith313,2,Wed Jul 1 05:27:48 2015 UTC,+1 for Grave Encounters. Surprisingly good.
horror,3bnqr2,laurathexplorer,3,Wed Jul 1 12:58:50 2015 UTC,The sequel is worthwhile as well for the way it lays on the meta elements.
horror,3bnqr2,redsoxfan95,14,Wed Jul 1 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Grave Encounters was a surprisingly great movie. The sequel took every single element ten steps too far and seemed like schlock to me. I was extremely disappointed with GE2.  Opinion, of course."
horror,3bnqr2,Race_Goose,3,Tue Jun 30 23:09:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed, while I usually like the meta aspect, I just felt like GE2 got too ridiculous with the mythology and also just wasn't as good as the first one."
horror,3bnqr2,jpjtourdiary,44,Wed Jul 1 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and ill say it again  The Den is a great movie to watch by yourself at night, I never even heard of it before watching it a few months back and it was surprisingly scary"

horror,3bnqr2,chepalleee,20,Tue Jun 30 18:44:19 2015 UTC,You and me both. I just didn't understand the love for The Babadook.

horror,3bnqr2,selfcheckout,6,Tue Jun 30 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but it definitely had it's flaws.  [Spoilers]   Did they keep their parents in hibernation until they needed them? Window breaks and their kid is always screaming at top of lungs, parents no where to be found? I got it from a one night stand who was gone in the morning, now let me explain exactly how this creature works in extreme detail. I can pick up a kid and throw him 20 feet, but the best I can do against a closed door is knock a tiny hole in it or knock on it? Why not trap it in a cage? Do airplanes not exist in this universe or does the creature have frequent flyer miles? A blanket? Spray paint the fucker and call the fucking army. For fucks sake.   Fun movie, but I hate it when people act like incompetent retards simply to further the plot."
horror,3bnqr2,twistedcain,3,Tue Jun 30 22:43:13 2015 UTC,"I loved this movie but I recognize the flaws in it. It suffers from the pesky third act crisis where we have a great premise, a perfect rise in the action, then ... pulled hair? A dumb plan to kill the monster? Ambiguous ending (even though the subtle camera work was great).  This could have been mitigated by giving some life to some of the characters. What's the deal with the dad and why should we feel anything when the demon takes his form? Who's dork boy, really? All we know is that they were childhood friends. What's the deal with the sister who gets shot? And the main character girl - all we actually know about her is that she digs pools (yeah yeah, I know, they're a metaphor, whatever). A little bit of character building could replace that whole scene at the lake, which I thought was pretty bad.   Actually, still go to the lake, that's fine. But ditch the hair pulling. Ditch the dumb cliche scene with the screaming demon (it's much scarier as a silent walking background image). Actually, fuck the gun altogether. Scrap the pool plan and have the dork boy love story be the semi-resolution. Much better pacing if you go that route."
horror,3bnqr2,kyak12,12,Tue Jun 30 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"Absentee parents. It was pretty obvious that none of the kids had a very good home life. And really, the parents either would've thought their children are crazy, or they wouldn't have been able to help any more than their friends could. The creature wasn't really that hard to understand, so I don't think it's unrealistic to have a one night stand and then be able to explain it. Also, the guy could've been lying about who he got it from. ""Why not trap it in a cage?"" It probably would've just gotten out. Also, it wouldn't say it knocked a tiny hole in that door... Airplanes are expensive and futile. It will still find you. Plus, if you get that far away from it, you have the disadvantage of having no idea when it will catch up with you. You'll either let your guard down and get killed by it, or you'll still have to be wary of everybody who might be it. In both cases, your life is still completely ruined, so airplanes are obviously not a solution. ""Hello, Army? I'm being chased by a paranormal STD incarnate that can manifest as any person, help me!"" *click* ""Hello? Hello?""   So yeah, none of your gripes with this movie seem valid in my opinion."
horror,3bnqr2,alaska1415,2,Tue Jun 30 22:33:32 2015 UTC,I completely agree
horror,3bnqr2,TheFullMonty1394,3,Wed Jul 1 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"The creature wasn't really hard to understand   Yes, he knew that the creature wouldn't hurt him after he slept with somebody. How again did he know that and why did no one question him as to how he knew that.   Hello, Army? I'm being chased by a paranormal STD incarnate   I don't know, dousing the creature with spray paint, like I said, would be a good indicator to the first police officers on the scene that something pretty fucked up is happening. I imagine they might call in the greatest phenomenon in history to their superiors.   Airplanes are expensive and futile.   Okay, a hot air balloon floating 20 feet about the ground then anchored by a breakaway cord. Does the creature float as well?   ""Why not trap it in a cage?"" It probably would've just gotten out.   Yeah, a swimming pool made a lot more sense. Never mind why there was a perfectly maintained abandoned swimming pool available for them to use and fire off gun shots at their convenience.  They also could have buried it in cement or tried burning it, freezing it or a host of other things that adults might have helped them think up."
horror,3bnqr2,GloriousHam,7,Tue Jun 30 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"In regards to knowing details about the monster, I don't think it's that much of a stretch that the person who gave it to him explained it in a similar way. Also, he seemed to have had the monster on his back for a fair while so he could have learnt a lot in that time."

Also the new insidious was really great.  That director is seriously filling in james wans footsteps and taking it up a notch
horror,3bnqr2,Rustyshackleford313,56,Tue Jun 30 19:04:15 2015 UTC,Pontypool (2008) surprised me both in terms of how much I enjoyed it and how much I was creeped out when I thought about it later on.

horror,3bnqr2,NixonInhell,4,Wed Jul 1 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"The concept is damn interesting and original, but I thought the movie got a bit worse towards the end. The first half is absolutely fantastic though, when they have no idea what's going on and try to piece together all the vague information they can get.  Also, I suppose people liked , but it just really made me want to see a regular zombie movie in this format."
horror,3bnqr2,WhatDoesStarFoxSay,6,Tue Jun 30 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"It surprised me how bad this was. I've heard it was good on here, damn near praised really and man its boring as hell.

Terribly boring, terrible ending, decent dialogue"

And initially I liked having the other worldly violence happening off screen. However, the on screen violence was the same shit that bored me about every other zombie movie out there. On top of that, there was zero pay off at the end. I'm Canadian and I wanted to like this movie, but the story would have been better served as a radio play.  EDIT: grammars"
horror,3bnqr2,Roller_ball,21,Wed Jul 1 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"The Battery. Zero budget zombie movie? Well, if I have to. And then it turns out to be this great character study about a couple of friends.  Zombie movies constantly focus on dramatic conflicts between camps of survivors, but here we pretty much have two guys who, you slowly learn, probably wouldn't have had much in common in the pre-apocalypse days. Now, they're forced to hang out with each other.  Basically, imagine the ""fun"" parts of Dawn of the Dead, where people are mostly passing time between zombie attacks. That's The Battery."

horror,3bnqr2,bierluvre,2,Wed Jul 1 04:33:04 2015 UTC,That's a great rec right there. Just watched and it was great!! Thanks
horror,3bnqr2,NixonInhell,36,Tue Jun 30 20:56:25 2015 UTC,Starry Eyes. I'd heard of it through Killer POV and after watching it I was stunned. One of the best female performances I've seen in the last few years as well.
horror,3bnqr2,ebolasupermonky,7,Wed Jul 1 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Amen, Alex Essoe was incredible in Starry Eyes."
horror,3bnqr2,NixonInhell,6,Wed Jul 1 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Starry Eyes was great. I forget where I heard about it, somewhere on the internet. What really blew me away was the great acting performance, and how much the main actress changed her apperance as the movie went on, she really put everything she had into this role. I think she should have won some awards for it, I know mainstream award shows snub horror movies, but that was one of the best performances of last year."
horror,3bnqr2,Elijahryoung,5,Tue Jun 30 21:16:05 2015 UTC,I agree.  That movie was seriously twisted.
horror,3bnqr2,yungbrew21,3,Tue Jun 30 21:52:47 2015 UTC,Better than the Maniac remake?
horror,3bnqr2,EternalRocksBeneath,3,Wed Jul 1 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"Damn, good point. I didn't think of Maniac. I guess as far as male led movies, that one would get my vote. Elijah's performance was incredible, as was the cinematography (the first person view the whole movie). But Starry Eyes still gets my vote for female led."
horror,3bnqr2,dyllybones,2,Wed Jul 1 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, I didn't like Maniac much. Not terrible and Elijah was good in it, but they totally pissed away the chance to do something original with the story from the killer's POV. I wanted to see more like the restaurant scene and the hallucinations with his mother. The first kill from his eyes was disturbing, but I found every one after that to be a bit monotonous. I would have loved to see him hallucinate himself doing really well with the women, but then he starts to see the blood, and then the wounds and death he has caused. As the movie progresses, he's realizing what he's doing and hallucinating less, until he's in full control of his actions by the end."

horror,3bnqr2,Retro21,3,Wed Jul 1 06:46:06 2015 UTC,I agree! I think the out of focus camera made it look scarier than it would have otherwise.
horror,3bnqr2,Retro21,2,Tue Jun 30 20:25:17 2015 UTC,The barn scene is incredibly unsettling. Great movie all around.
horror,3bnqr2,Elijahryoung,10,Wed Jul 1 00:21:46 2015 UTC,"Late Phases is by no means good enough to bring about a ""rebirth"" of werewolf films, but I enjoyed the hell out of it. When was the last time you saw a blind, badass 'Nam vet take on a bunch of werewolves? If your answer is ""never,"" then you should watch Late Phases. It's pretty slow throughout, but the characters are great and the ending is super-satisfying. The effects are forgivable; could be better, could be worse. Wasn't a huge fan of the werewolf designs, but I applaud the use of suit-actors instead of regular ordinary wolves or terrible CG digi-wolves. The music is pretty rad, too. I'm kind of sad I can't find the soundtrack."
horror,3bnqr2,Trogpint,4,Wed Jul 1 02:11:12 2015 UTC,I really liked the pacing of it. Everything after the first act makes you want to see how shit goes down next. Also I liked how the characters were not your usual horror stereo types.

It's not a straight up horror, but it's in the same ballpark. It's a fun movie with Ryan Reynolds as a serial killer ala Berkowitz. I recommend it."
horror,3bnqr2,thisisnotkathy,2,Tue Jun 30 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure how much I would like it, after the trailers but it seemed my kind of movie. I loved it too, but it's so incredibly sad in parts."

I can't believe the bad reviews it got, it's very good imo.  Not horror for sure though, maybe a bit of slasher thrown into it? I can't even quantify the genre of it."

horror,3bnqr2,petenoodles,9,Wed Jul 1 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"Lake Mungo is one of my favorite horror movies. It captures the feeling of loss so well, and is just so haunting and... quietly unsettling that it lodges itself in your memory for a long time afterward."
horror,3bnqr2,Rasalom,4,Tue Jun 30 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Trailer Park of Terror. I was shocked, I mean absolutely gobsmacked, by how much it did not suck. I mean, this is a movie that cast country singer Trace Adkins as Satan... and he nails it. Yes, it's low budget and some of the actors should never have stepped foot in front of a camera. But many of the actors are really quite good, and the movie's got some unique kills and some cool directorial touches."

I was going to make it a movie I watch every Christmas right along with die hard, but the scene where someone dies at the end was too upsetting. I'm trying not to do spoilers but I'll just say as someone with a very similar relationship it was too much for me to take!"
horror,3bnqr2,voltron42,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:01 2015 UTC,I really want my fiance to see it but I burned her out on scary movies last October. I'm going to watch it again when she finally gets around to it.

horror,3bnqr2,Trogpint,3,Tue Jun 30 23:55:15 2015 UTC,"Agree on all fronts.     Really don't understand the hype train behind it follows.  Solid acting and original storyline, incredible scoring and soundtrack, but I just wasn't very entertained."
horror,3bnqr2,mewk69,3,Wed Jul 1 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Pontypool, Odd Thomas,  and John Dies At The End.  Each of these are easily labeled as ""game changers"" and ""genre redefining""  Btw, the book of John Dies At The End is an absolute must read. I've never before read anything that could terrify and disturb me at the same time that it made me laugh out loud. The sequel,  This Book Is Full Of Spiders, is just as good if not better. However, reading the books actually made the movie somewhat disappointing, not only in how much detail was left out,  but also in how key elements of the story were left our of the movie,  to the point that events in the movie that made little or no sense not only made sense in the book, but were that much scarier for it."
horror,3bnqr2,SoulFire6464,3,Wed Jul 1 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"Triangle - quite a brilliant piece of mindfuckery with some neat throwbacks to The Shining. Also, Melissa George running around in shorts."

horror,3bnqr2,slayniac,2,Wed Jul 1 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely adored Take Shelter... Dark and brooding throughout, it was a movie that constantly meandered, but somehow had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Shannon was standout in it too."

After the fact, I realized the director also did Devil Inside, which I liked, and Stay Alive, which I hadn't seen, but I have now but was a dud.    I liked your pick as well, Stakeland, except I had previously seen Jim Mickle's Mullberry Street, so I was pretty much expecting some kick ass."

I really didn't think I was going to be that engaged or intrigued.  Noah drowning actually had me believing that he was in peril, and I genuinely felt my heart drop. Also, the mask is actually pretty terrifying, and I do not care if its not the mask from the original.  I'm in love with Emma, there I said it. She's the same down-to-earth popular girl character that Sidney was and I love it so much. I love the dynamic between her and Audrey and I'm excited to see where their relationship goes.

The first Scream was very self-aware and constantly made fun of it's own tropes and cliches, but I don't know if that's what the TV show is trying to do.  The nerdy character is basically just putting ""us"" into the show, explaining how the premise will work each week, so I get the feeling they are trying to emulate that 'Self Aware-ness"" from the first film."
horror,3bpfhj,Throwawaylikeits1992,2,Wed Jul 1 06:42:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm impressed by how well they are handling the self awareness without being us over the head with it.
horror,3bpfhj,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,2,Wed Jul 1 08:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I also really hope that the make the killer a dope. Like they make him trip and get hit with stuff like the first film.  I think they're doing a good job with the self-awareness in their own way. It's definitely not as self-aware than the film IMO, but I think it's good enough for the younger teenage generation that are watching the show who have probably never seen the movie."
horror,3bpfhj,Avidgwentplayer,8,Wed Jul 1 18:09:15 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying the opening episode.  I already have a working theory on how this will play out over the season.  The Brandon James storyline is something different.  Fantastic first segment.
horror,3bpfhj,Throwawaylikeits1992,8,Wed Jul 1 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"I've really liked it so far.  The party scene was basically an entire re-creation of the scene from the 1st film, as well as the opening scene."
horror,3bpfhj,Avidgwentplayer,6,Wed Jul 1 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"I would agree.  The look ahead for the rest of the season looks solid as well.  The slower pace is welcomed, and it is going to suck when those we like die.  Lots of suspects, and lots of potential victims.  Can't wait to see where it goes."
horror,3bpfhj,Throwawaylikeits1992,3,Wed Jul 1 03:10:45 2015 UTC,I got kinda bummed because the trailer for the season gave away a lot of kills.
horror,3bpfhj,Avidgwentplayer,3,Wed Jul 1 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  It didn't show close up who got killed, and I only half payed attention.  I rarely watch the ""next time on"" segment for that very reason.  I plan on sticking to that from now on with this series."
horror,3bpfhj,Throwawaylikeits1992,0,Wed Jul 1 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"Well we already know that ""lesbian"" girlfriend dies.  I still can't figure out who the main character is supposed to be? Is it the blonde chick or the ""bi-curious"" one?"

horror,3bpfhj,Fobulousguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:25:09 2015 UTC,IMDB gives away a lot of kills.  Just look at how many episodes some of the teens are in.  Kinda like a countdown.

horror,3bpfhj,signu1230,15,Wed Jul 1 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"The opening scene was pretty much a carbon copy/homage/whatever you want to call it to the very start of Scream.  A blond girl (Casey/Nina) is home alone being electronically hassled (phone calls/web cam and Totally-Not-Snapchat) by someone she thinks is a friend playing a tasteless joke.  The situation quickly turns dark, her love interest (Steve/Tyler) is the first one killed, but the girl's kill is the one that's remembered because it's the one that happens onscreen, there's a fruitless cat-and-mouse chase, all until her mother comes home and discovers the butchered body of her daughter.  Not sure how I feel about such a close imitation, guess I'll see after a few more episodes.  So far the show is awash with the expected archetypes, but I'm waiting for moments where the plot twists the expectations and goes against the stereotypes.  My two favorite characters have to be Audrey and Noah, simply because they're not total asshats.  I just wish there was more finesse to the writing.  As it stands, it feels kind of clunky and desperate to seem current with pop culture.  Also, the writers seem to have no idea of how alcohol works.  Right before Brooke went into the garage to investigate the lights turning on, Noah was having a drink and giving his Randy speech in the living room.  By the time Brooke was out of the garage, Noah was passing out.  Then he woke up perfectly sober on a raft a little later.  Just seems sloppy.  Also, what kind of name is Brandon James for a menacing killer?  Then again, this was a pilot.  And pilots are rarely good.  Am I going to tune in every week?  Yes.  Are my hopes terribly high?  No."
horror,3bpfhj,PENGUINSflyGOOD,6,Sat Jul 4 00:35:49 2015 UTC,honestly I think noah got roofied/something else in his drink.
horror,3bpfhj,NancyDrewFan123,2,Sat Jul 4 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"I definitely though that, at least. I guess it can also be attributed to bad writing."
horror,3bpfhj,Khnagar,2,Wed Jul 1 15:07:27 2015 UTC,"It's another series about ridiciously attractive high school kids doing high school things while hanging out in their parents multi-million dollar homes. There are two characters that resemble normal human beings, ie Aubrey and Noah.  I was on the fence about wheter or not this was an ok adoptation for the tv-screen, I mean, a good film might not always make a great tv series and this wasn't that bad, right? Then I remembered Fargo, and how that tv show compared to the film. And Scream is really mediocre so far."
horror,3bpfhj,equilibrium02,4,Wed Jul 1 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"Overall, a good pilot.  It reminded me a lot of the first Scream, including the homages to various scenes and lines from the first movie.  The characters were decent enough and the acting wasn't half bad.  I think if each character has time to grow throughout the season we'll start getting better performances.  The viral video serving as the catalyst for the killings is a cool way to bring the franchise into a modern setting and I enjoyed seeing them set up various suspects and possible motives they all might have for wanting to butcher all of their friends.  The Brandon James back story was different, I'm interested to see how they play with that over the course of the show.  Not bad at all.  Definitely intrigued, looking forward to the rest of the season."
horror,3bpfhj,andybl,4,Wed Jul 1 09:17:05 2015 UTC,Kind of excited my favorite horror film growing up is taking place in the city I live in and the high school I went to. So surreal.
horror,3bpfhj,Lur7z6,8,Thu Jul 2 03:49:00 2015 UTC,"First segment before first commercial was brilliant. Loved it, especially ending with the monologue. Opening kill was great.   EDIT 1: Not digging the backstory thing, but ok.   The cliched characters are decent, but I cannot tell these people apart."
horror,3bpfhj,Throwawaylikeits1992,6,Thu Jul 2 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"And why do they all look to be in their 30s?  The ""bad boy"" that the girl kisses at the party looks like he's the adult chaperone."
horror,3bpfhj,Khnagar,3,Wed Jul 1 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"The cliched characters are decent, but I cannot tell these people apart.   They are all impeccably pretty, fashion model look alikes, perfectly dressed at all times, health studio bodies that are starved to perfection and good grief, does anyone believe this is what students of that age look like? Even their teacher looks like a model barely out of his teens.   What annoys me more is that the level of blood and gore is so PG-13. There's not going to be a lot of inventive, creative killings in the show I fear. And to me those are important for an entry in the slasher genre.  ""You have to forget that this is a horror story. You have to stop expecting people to die at every turn. You have to start caring about wheter the hot teacher is a little bit too interested in his female students. You have to start caring about wheter or not the football team wins or loses.You root for them, you love them. So if they are brutally murdered...""  Jesus, christ, no. This is not at all what I want from a slasher."
horror,3bpfhj,signu1230,3,Wed Jul 1 07:37:34 2015 UTC,Agreed with the first segment haha
horror,3bpfhj,GaleWeathershair,2,Wed Jul 1 02:24:46 2015 UTC,I kind of have to agree with the last part.  Lots of blondes and guys with swoopy hair.
horror,3bpfhj,EinsteinDisguised,2,Wed Jul 1 06:39:29 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this first episode. Quite a few scenes paid homage to the original. Honestly, I can't imagine this show being anywhere but MTV. One of my favorite things about the Scream series is the soundtrack which I can tell with the show they thought about. Excited for this season!"
horror,3bpfhj,alexdelia,2,Wed Jul 1 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"I thought it was alright. Good enough to keep me watching another week, at least. It seemed a little heavy-handed, but I was kind of ok with it. Yeah, Emma is basically Sydney, Noah is supposed to be Randy, Will (I think that's his name) seems like an amalgamation of Billy and Stu. Whatever.   My reaction after watching it was basically, ""Bless their hearts, they're trying."""
horror,3bpfhj,darknessvisible,2,Wed Jul 1 04:08:04 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good for what it was. Still felt like it was made for a demographic a bit younger than me, rather than people who grew up with the franchise.  On an unrelated note, this was my wife and I's first time watching MTV in well over a decade, and it was strange."
horror,3bpfhj,darknessvisible,2,Wed Jul 1 09:13:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the pilot was rubbish, and was going to give up on the whole show.  But I stuck it out to episodes 2 and 3 and I think it's getting better.  Emma, Audrey, Noah and Maggie are good lead characters.  But if the killer(s) turn out to be coded closet gays Will and Kieran then I'm going to scream."
horror,3bpfhj,pyrs,3,Wed Jul 1 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"Good lord, that was a feeble pilot.  The original Scream is such a classic movie, and this TV version is a diluted, anodyne travesty.  I do get it that there's a limit to how scary you can make an OTA show aimed at teens, but ""Not Scary AT ALL"" seems pointless."

One of the main things I liked was the commentary about horror tv series, and the way a character explains it's not just a typical whodunit. The blood looks good too. Mainly I'll stick for the nostalgic feelings and the fact that I like to see annoying teens dying. Also if it doesn't get worse than the pilot I may even become a fan, but it's too early to tell."

It's easy enough to tell how inferior they are compared with Bottin's effects from 1982 even on Youtube (their Harbinger Down stuff made me lol).  Producers don't want to spend more money.  They spend more money doing the same thing over again, or paying to have something fixed when it's not good enough.  Same thing has happened multiple times to Rick Baker, unfortunately.    Their techniques have failed to adequately evolve, they don't photograph well digitally, the older artists are mostly not as good as when they were young and the the younger artists aren't as good either.  It's a sad state of affairs for the practical effects industry that they share responsibility for."

I haven't seen one found footage film that fixes that issue and again, there a lot of fun ones out there even outside of horror. But when you've got demons knocking you around a room and your first reaction is to get the camera then look around the room...."
horror,3briia,William_Hand,2,Wed Jul 1 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"When you have the conceit that it's a film/documentary crew it's still a major stretch but sometimes more or less believable, to a certain point.  Once the situation escalates enough there's no reasonable expectation for even a professional or passionate amateur to still be rolling footage.  It just becomes dumb and  the excuse of ""leap of faith"" given by apologists is a laughable cop-out."
horror,3briia,BurnetRhoades,2,Wed Jul 1 16:40:43 2015 UTC,Have you seen the very recent video of the guy filming during the terrorist attack on the beach of Tunisia? One guy is filming as he is under attack and continues to film with his phone as he plan to attack directly the armed killer back. Behaviors like this make the found footage more and more beliveable to me!
horror,3briia,BurnetRhoades,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"This still isn't near the same thing.  That's not the same ballpark, that's not even the same sport."
horror,3briia,Roller_ball,2,Thu Jul 2 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"That's actually becoming pretty believable. We are seeing more and more that when tragedy occurs, people's first reaction is to tape it with their camera. ex-really, really NSFL.   What I hate it the conversations about filming. ""Can you put the camera down!"" ""No, I need to keep filming. It is the only way I can handle the fear/all this would be for nothing/ need to pay my property taxes."" I've never seen a real documentary where the people talk about whether or not they should keep filming. We've seen enough of the genre to accept them filming in part of our suspension of disbelief. I know it is not horror, but I totally was willing to accept The Office as a documentary until they started involving Brian. We need to take Brian-ing out of found footage. Seriously, fuck Brian."
horror,3briia,BurnetRhoades,-1,Wed Jul 1 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"That's actually becoming pretty believable. We are seeing more and more that when tragedy occurs, people's first reaction is to tape it with their camera.   Big difference between someone being tastelessly voyeuristic and when the tragedy is actually happening to you.  These are not equivalent phenomenons.   The average found footage filmmaker would have you believe the dude under the train is going to whip out his iPhone and video his own dismemberment while babbling about how fucked he is."
horror,3briia,BurnetRhoades,0,Wed Jul 1 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, this is one of the major drawback with found footage. But there are alternative, like in Man Bites Dog or The Rise of Leslie Vernon where it is not directly the main character who hold the camera but a group of journalist following them. I prefer those ones because the main character movement are not limited by the camera, and even more because the main character can speak directly to the camera, thereby giving the illusion that he is speaking to the audience directly."
horror,3briia,Roller_ball,0,Thu Jul 2 01:33:22 2015 UTC,Mockumentary or faux documentary are not the same thing as found footage.
horror,3briia,diceman89,3,Thu Jul 2 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like the one thing horror needs to learn from found footage is that it is okay to have the characters die at the end. I feel like horror movies in the 90's and 2000's always spend so long on giving the movie a proper 'ending' where the good person wins, and it usually took the air out of the tires. Horror is about the emotion. It is fine for the characters to die. I think the worst is a half hour ending where the heroes escape, then the villain just jumps out of the bushes, slashes the throat, then cuts to credits. While found footage has it's huge amount of flaws, it does a pretty good job of pacing at the ending where I feel other horror films should take note."
horror,3briia,m6wg4bxw,3,Wed Jul 1 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"But by the nature of found footage movies, they just about have to end with the main character dying. Otherwise, there aren't many excuses for why the footage would be lost and found in the first place. One problem that I do have with that, is that it often seems like an excuse to not have to actually come up with an ending. Just let some one die and you can end it where ever."
horror,3briia,simplefilmreviews,0,Wed Jul 1 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"Mostly, I think found footage makers kill the main character at the end because they have no other ideas - but again it is a problem of lack of ideas. There are so many other possibilities, like the character getting abducted, or someone sending the video anonymously, etc. all these leaves space for a nice ending."
horror,3briia,blackseaoftrees,3,Thu Jul 2 01:30:08 2015 UTC,"I haven’t seen more than a few found-footage movies. The ones I recall are Trollhunter, Cloverfield, The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity 3, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, and Willow Creek. Trollhunter is the only one I enjoyed. The others were quite unpleasant experiences."

horror,3bokpo,spwf,22,Tue Jun 30 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  The genre has always been a mixed bag of unwatchable crap, fun cheesy b-movies, and truly terrifying flicks. The past few years have not been an exception to that rule. Obviously there are trends that come and go (slashers, zombies, possession movies, etc.) but, given the nature of horror itself,  I believe the genre will always be a mixed bag."

horror,3bokpo,ArcticKid,2,Wed Jul 1 02:58:51 2015 UTC,"While I do think that's true, I think the thing wrong with modern horror isn't a result of the nature of the genre itself but a result of different technology - I'm talking about shaky-cam and found-footage movies. I'll take the crappiest CGI in the world over a camera shaking so badly it makes me nauseous."

Although I'm fairly young, I guess I have the nostalgia lenses on when I think about the movies I grew up with. I was definitely raised on horror. However, I still want to bitch about overuse of CGI and jump scare tactics."
horror,3bokpo,bro20blazeit,3,Wed Jul 1 05:43:04 2015 UTC,True enough and before CGI there was plenty of crappy stop-motion animation.
horror,3bokpo,CharlottedeSouza,6,Wed Jul 1 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing. It's just something people can and will complain about. Modern anything never seems to be as good as what you grew up with, or what came before. I enjoy most of the modern horror movies I've seen, and I certainly don't mind if other people don't."
horror,3bokpo,HumanCenticycle,5,Tue Jun 30 23:05:21 2015 UTC,"Some here say nothing, that horror has always been a mixed bag.  That's partially true.  It's always been a mixed bag of quality.  It's always been a, with few exceptions, B-Movie category (all genre is historically B-Movie material).   But we have a phenomenon now that didn't really exist in the '80s and '70s or before and pretty much started in the '90s and the overall decline it brought.  This same phenomenon happened in popular music, particularly hard rock, where you have all sorts of bands playing music in the same style as their greatest (and possibly only) influences. Because of this they'll never be as good.  At best their greatest contribution to culture would be a collection of songs that strive to be the album their idols never created.    There are hundreds of bands influenced by Led Zeppelin, playing hard rock, meanwhile, Led Zeppelin wasn't influenced and drawing from other hard rock bands, they were drawing from Blues and Folk and Jazz and Classical, Country and various tribal styles.  Black Sabbath invented Heavy Metal by combining Blues, Jazz, Swing and Classical.     John Carpenter didn't make horror movies because the movies he watched were mostly horror movies.  His biggest influence weren't horror film directors.  He idolized guys that made Noir pictures and Westerns.  He had a constricting religious upbringing so he rebelled against that.  These are the elements you find in all of his movies and what's missing from films that simply imitate his films.  In other words, a fair majority of horror these days is essentially inbred.  The films and other creations are the equivalent to the three-eyed, seven-toed hairlip baby you get when a brother and sister lay together."
horror,3bokpo,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:57:30 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense. There are a whole bunch of fanboy filmmakers in the horror genre that seem to love the aesthetics of the genre, but regard horror as a big collection of tropes rather than an emotion to evoke."
horror,3bokpo,ArabiaFats,6,Wed Jul 1 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Too much CGI. Too many ""jump scares"". Too many remakes of classic horror. PG-13."
horror,3bokpo,mr_gold74,2,Wed Jul 1 02:39:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really want to see directors get away with being super creative more instead of churning out remake after remake, as well as not trying to make their films PG 13 to be more marketable."
horror,3bokpo,bro20blazeit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"The only really good remake I've seen was Fright Night, because the original was kinda cheesy anyway. And the scariest scene in it, imo, was where Colin Farrell is just sitting in his living room, watching TV and somehow just projects creepiness onto the screen. The effects ruin any sense of immersion for me - a good horror movie is partly dependent on how it's shot and empathising with the characters rather than the gore and shadowy strobe-effect creatures."
horror,3bokpo,CharlottedeSouza,2,Wed Jul 1 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't seen the remake yet.  I totally agree, the cinematography and the immersion factor, as well as relatable or likable characters are key.  Building the dread factor and suspense is also important.  ""Insidious"" wasn't perfect, but it most certainly managed to spook me in parts due to the rising tension."
horror,3bokpo,mr_gold74,2,Thu Jul 2 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"If anything, theatrical horror seems to be weak. There are some exceptions but this year has had a ton of stinkers on the big screen, while the better ones are immediately streaming on Netflix or VOD."
horror,3bokpo,JaketheSnake54,2,Tue Jun 30 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with modern horror? Well, if anything, I'd say pacing. Throwing the threat on screen, or very un-subtly hinting that it'll come soon, without much time to let the atmosphere sink in.  However, IMO, horror is in an upswing. The past decade, the genre was oversaturated with shaky-cam, quick cuts, digital tint-for-tint's-sake, generic soundtracks, too much parody, and gore in the place of scares, in addition to the aforementioned pacing issues.   Not as much of that is apparent now. Lately we've been getting more original plots, actual suspense, careful direction and characters worth caring for. Even some memorable soundtracks (how many of those had we gotten from 1995-2009?)"
horror,3bokpo,ArabiaFats,2,Tue Jun 30 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"An unwillingness to make a truly scary, shocking movie. There are plenty of exceptions, but most theatrical movies I end up seeing are PG-13 drek that dial everything back and/or cut away rather than make a solid R-rated film. Sure, there's plenty that have great atmosphere, like Sinister, but for every original, creepy movie there's a dozen films in theaters that are just dumb ghosts or zombies."
horror,3bokpo,SyntheticGod8,2,Wed Jul 1 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the lack of presence.  Otherwise, I agree with Cryptogrammar.  I wish more modern directors would take a look at the works of Dario Argento, Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick.  These are directors who were able to make nothing itself terrifying.  They could show you a hallway, or a chair, or a child's toy and you'd be filled with terror.  They didn't need CGI, makeup, special effects or jump scares.  They understood fear.  Fear isn't what you see, it's what you don't see.    The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown__Lovecraft"
horror,3bokpo,GoliathPrime,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think that horror, just like everything, changes with the times. Blair Witch Project got big, a shitton of found footage movies came out. From there the subgenre just kind of branched out and movies with supernatural elements like Paranormal Activity came.   When the Dawn of the Dead remake came out a shitton of zombie movies came. These kinds of movies are fairly easy to make but I feel like a lot of movies that have come out were made more for the people that were involved than those who watch them.  Overall, horror is horror. Just like anything, what one person might love another person hates."
horror,3bokpo,johnnydakota,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:21:44 2015 UTC,"From my point-of-view? It just doesn't cater to my personal tastes. But if other people enjoy the stuff coming out, then there's nothing really wrong with it. Besides, once in awhile I do find a new horror flick I enjoy. So I'm not being completely neglected.  Edit: Oh, and Giallo needs to make a comeback."
horror,3bokpo,ranranbolly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"If you ask me the one thing I dislike about some (not all) modern horror films is their lack of subtlety. They can't seem to do anything without being totally blatant and obvious. Some of the best horror movies in the past were able to do so much with so little. Back then it was a necessity because most horror films had small budgets and subtle horror was a way to get the most bang for your buck. Now most horror films have relatively large budgets and focus all their resources into the wrong things.   If you're given a huge budget for a horror movie you should start by throwing a massive amount of the money into preproduction creative efforts like writing, concept art, practical effects designs, and set decoration. That way you have something decent as a foundation and the modest remainder of your budget will force you to make wise choices about what to spend your time and money on, thus forcing you to be subtle.  John Carpenter is a good example of this because he's made some of the absolute best science fiction and horror films of all time, and he has also made some of the biggest pieces of shit too. The one trait which appears to be common in all his good movies is that they all began with a small budget in which he was forced to do most of the creative work on the cheap. The one trait which all his pieces of shit have in common is that they were all given massive budgets which he took for granted and focused into crappy special effects rather than things that really mattered."

I feel like all of a sudden I take horror for granted; with so much more readily available to me (with Netflix and Amazon renting) I rarely give a film my undivided attention. I'm squandering movies and I hate myself for it. The only good thing to come of it is that as a consequence, I'm going to the cinema more where I can't watch with one eye on work/reddit/email."
horror,3bp2l3,RachelSpecter,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"When i’m talking about the paranormal with some people here is what 80% of them tell me :” I really do love the paranormal but it scares me!” Something absolutely normal and explanable, fear is an emotion very hard to control and being scared is animal when you feel a danger. Fear is not innate, you develop it after experiences in the past that, some of the time, you cannot remember. But your body and your memory record it and that’s why when you scared you can really feel your body’s reactions. When you’re suddenly scared, you may want to run away, to scream, you shiver, you have goose bumps, you may cry and sweat and your heart beats so hard. Sometimes you can also faint, and a few times, well thanks god these one are rare, you can die. You know that quote “It scares me to death” well it could be real, fear can be so intense that could provoke an heart attack."

The second one was pretty meh, but since this third one was more prequel and kind of a new start, I was very hopeful.    EDIT:  I haven't seen it yet, but now I'm sad."
horror,3bl3v8,Plato_Karamazov,2,Tue Jun 30 14:57:23 2015 UTC,I completely disagree that Insidious wasn't a game changer. It put James Wan and Blumhouse on the map for horror and started a franchise. I recently saw the remake of Poltergeist and you could see how apparent it was that the filmmakers used the Insidious films as a reference.

horror,3bl3v8,KHelfant,10,Tue Jun 30 10:54:03 2015 UTC,"The synth soundtrack by Disasterpeace had this eerie retro-chic feel to it. The concept of a relentless thing that will follow you to the ends of the earth at its leisure because there is nowhere you can ever hide is terrifying. The whole thing is also a fantastic analogy for sexually transmitted infections. What you think is going to be a magical moment, your first time, winds up being your death warrant? That is objectively horrifying.  It's less about visceral horror (although the creature did take on some freaky human forms) and more about existential horror."
horror,3bl3v8,alaska1415,4,Tue Jun 30 11:21:12 2015 UTC,"Of course the sex connection was there, but I honestly thought it went deeper than that.  I assumed it was about growing up.  Sex is kind of a sign that you're growing into an adult, leaving childhood innocence behind, but that the ""It"" that follows is adulthood.  Responsibility.  The fact that life will catch up to you and you will no longer be a kid, no matter how far or how fast you run.    At least that's what I took from it.  The sex was just as much a metaphor for growing up as the monster to me."
horror,3bl3v8,dr-mladjo,2,Tue Jun 30 14:59:15 2015 UTC,Nice! I had picked up on some coming of age themes but hadn't thought of it in exactly those terms. I'll bear that in mind when I watch it again!
horror,3bl3v8,alaska1415,3,Tue Jun 30 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I actually loved it as a movie but hated it as a horror movie. The plot and the characters were incredibly interesting, the atmosphere was subtle and building, and the concept itself was novel, but at no point in the movie was I even mildly scared.  All the ""scares"" were just boring to me, and some, like the first time it breaks her window and she runs upstairs, seemed actually cheesy.   I can totally  understand why people liked the movie overall, and I wholeheartedly agree, but what people were scared by is beyond me."
horror,3bl3v8,KHelfant,2,Tue Jun 30 13:19:02 2015 UTC,"Nice response! I think I appreciated it as a horror film due to my interested in weird horror, like HP Lovecraft. I have a hard time with visceral horror like dismemberment and body horror, so something that was more emotional totally appealed to me. And yeah, at its core It Follows could totally be a coming of age film if you focused on the relationships between characters and how the event changed them.  One thing I personally disliked was the reliance on jump scares. The film had this fantastic sense of atmosphere, so the use of loud noises and sudden cuts was a major buzz-kill for me."
horror,3bl3v8,alaska1415,-2,Tue Jun 30 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"The sound was fine, sure. But the creature, to me at least, while original wasn't scary. Like at all. I get the whole constantly coming after you thing. But they just used those moments in the movie to do nothing. And then the thing catches up and grabs her hair? What the fuck?"

horror,3bl3v8,foundfootagefan,5,Tue Jun 30 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"Would you have liked it more if it had tried to reach for her neck but she'd pulled away enough for it to miss and catch hold of her hair? I mean, yeah, it's a movie, and she was the protagonist, so there's only so much peril she can be in before it's game over and we don't have a story any more."
horror,3bl3v8,MixingDrinks,-4,Tue Jun 30 14:02:26 2015 UTC,Yeah....that would have been better. Sure it seems unbelievable. But this is a horror movie. It'd make more sense that something trying to kill someone would at least do a semi decent job at it. I mean it lunged at that other guy.
horror,3bl3v8,beige4ever,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"Careful people here love the movie for some reason and downvote everyone that didn't like the movie. A cursory glance at reviews seems to be split with people either really liking the film or absolutely hating it. But Dreadit seems to dismiss anyone with any criticisms of the movie.   I thought it was terrible. I went with several other people and they thought it was terrible. The theater I was in emptied with a palpable air of dissatisfaction. I absolutely love horror movies, I understand that a lot of them take a certain amount of fantasy and imagination on the viewer's part to be fully immersed in them, else the illusion is easily shattered and the inherent flaws with the genre become apparent. But this movie was just dumb. The acting was bad, the premise was bad, the decisions the characters made WERE BAD. There was absolutely no logic behind anything in the movie. It had zero redeeming attributes to me. And the whole idea of the follower was just dumb. I mean seriously, how could they not figure out that all that needed to be done was fly across the world once a year and transfer the follower and there would be literally nothing to worry about. It's not like they had any qualms about passing it on and killing unwitting bystanders   All that being said, the movie did provide one thing to me and my friends, a conversation piece. There were so many plot holes in the movie and the story was so dumb it actually cause us to continue talking about it for months after seeing it. Much like the follower itself, this movie has a certain staying power that will stick with you."

It dif tread a lot of old ground but there were only a few times early on when this felt like a hindrance to the film itself, by the third act however it felt like a cookie cut horror movie.  I guess where the film really went down hill was (spoilers) directly after the scene where that long tendril of red matter shot out of the girls mouth. It caught me off guard and the way the director handled this scene really impressed me, even the footage of this bit that they replay felt really cool. I should mention the plot again because the cult idea and the explenation for the second personality was really interesting, when the reveal came I actually got that real feeling of dread that horror movies seldom instil these days.  But from that point it went down hill and became pretty fucking bland.  Overall I heard the budget got slashed considerably and so the whole second half of the film was rewritten, damn shame because the original ending idea was fantastic but instead we get a half hearted attempt at a resolution that felt too familiar and forgettable.  Really hoping Hammer pick up their game soon..."

I like everything about it so far.  A couple of caveats:      You do have to provide a CC and cancel beforre the 60 day free trial ends, otherwise it bills at a pretty reasonable $4.99USD/mo... (no big whoop, just set a reminder in gmail or whatever)    It seems to cookie your PC; I signed up for the beta at work then found that I could not login from my laptop or home PC... =+/  Guess I will have to try and find a workaround for that; til then choose carefully.     FWIW I'd probably pay $5/mo if I could login from any PC and if they had a mobile app with Chromecast support..."

horror,3bkebe,Schmigglepop,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:05:27 2015 UTC,Most remakes have at least the minor argument (justifying the remake) of the distraction of reading subtitles while there are things we should be carefully watching or fearing on screen.  But the careful pacing of the original left me completely undistracted as I watched and read.
horror,3bkebe,Schmigglepop,8,Tue Jun 30 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"This seems so unnecessary and is a real shame. I feel that a happy/hopeful ending would ruin the film, and I know I am not alone here.   All American remakes seem to take that stance on foreign/overseas films, e.g. The Descent..."

horror,3bkebe,sublimemongrel,2,Tue Jun 30 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  To me, it was about transcendental awakening. It wasn't until the complete physical torture that the victim, or subject, could reach an existential awakening. The torture is so visceral and extreme that no one could physically survive it, but the whole point was, this is what we are trying to achieve: euphoria and realization through the most ultimate pain. Thus, the name martyrs. The whole point of the movie is about this, and unless you keep true to this ending, it's just torture for the purpose of torture."

I, too, have been binge watching ""new to me"" horror all month and we've picked a lot of the same films. I actually started with Odd Thomas and I watched The Town That Dreaded Sundown remake about two weeks ago.    I wasn't originally planning on trying to watch 100 nights of Horror but you've inspired me to try. As soon as I can find some time I'll try and type up a list of what I've watched so far. Tonight's movie is going to be Eduardo Sánchez's new Bigfoot film, Exists (2010)."

I am lucky enough to have 1) a job where I don't have to be there until around 11am or noon, and 2) an understanding girlfriend. It should be smooth sailing until classes start back up. Let me know what you have enjoyed and if it's new to me then I will probably add it to my list too. I just read the Exists IMDb page and it looks pretty good. I also saw the movie Clown under the ""people also liked"" section. I don't know why but I really want to see that. I watched some previews a while back and just thought it looked really interesting. I don't know why I get so into the ""mutating/failing body"" horror films so much, but sometimes they really creep me out lol."

He never feels the need to irritably have to explain things or put context on things - that gives you too much of a safe grasp on things. Things are what they are - a screen reality being presented. Madness or visions or paranoia or supernatural - its all the same really lurking under the surface of normality.

horror,3bhu20,megarabbit,5,Mon Jun 29 12:59:46 2015 UTC,"This was interesting to me as it was William Castle's attempt to go legitimate after a successful career as the B horror movie king.  He did it right, but I'm sure Roman Polanski's direction had a lot to do with it.   The acting was superb and it hit the absolute best mix of realism and the supernatural.   I also thought the movie was making a statement about the state of the American housewife in that time period.   Rosemary had such a lack of control of her life and was dominated by her husband, doctor and the Castevets."

horror,3bhu20,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"The Green Mile is basically the book.  But sticking to a book is rarely the recipe for good filmmaking.  Only some books adapt directly to film because of the way they're written and structured.  It sounds like this is one of those rare cases, because if the book is as good as the movie then I'd assume it must be a good book (coming at it from the reverse).  They're two entirely different mediums.  A book has fewer limitations and very little pressure to get on with it.  It doesn't have to deal with a finite window through which information is delivered.  It can meander and go off on tangents and sub plots that amount to nothing and lead nowhere and are there for nothing more than textural detail or to satisfy the whim of the writer.  A book can introduce throwaway characters, places, things that never mean anything or move the story along or are ever referenced again.  All of these things are bad storytelling, in the filmmaking context.  A good screenwriter knows when to omit or change something that's ultimately irrelevant or can be improved for the film.  So, following a book very closely or exactly is really just a fact that's either good or bad based mostly on the book itself.  Sounds like it was a good call in this case."

horror,3bila0,jondillanger,2,Mon Jun 29 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"The Nightmare is directed by Rodney Ascher, who also did Room 237, so just know that going in. My impression based on those two films is that Ascher is a pretty deliberately passive director, creating a space for people to share stories around a theme, and letting you draw your own conclusions through the juxtaposition. A lot of people didn't like Room 237 because they assumed it's failure to discredit the ideas of its subjects was tantamount to endorsement. A lot of people didn't like The Nightmare because it makes no effort to explain the science of sleep paralysis. I don't think it was the director's intention to do either of those things when he made these movies."
horror,3bila0,LuigiVanPeebles,6,Mon Jun 29 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting. I've suffered from sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember and I've certainly experienced some spooky dream/hallucinations. When I was young I dreamt that an angel came to me and said ""this is what hell will feel like"" and then I descended into a big pit of red painful torture. I've dreamt a witch lady(think the black bride from insidious) has screamed at me and set her demons upon me and plenty of times I've been paralyzed but just KNEW someone was in the room with me only to wake up to no one there.  Sometimes they turn really kinky though so that's a plus.  Anyway I'm certain they're just bad dreams. Lucid and realistic maybe, but still just dreams.   I'd like to see this documentary!"

horror,3bila0,TrumanB-12,2,Mon Jun 29 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"I really wished it was as scary as they were leading everyone to believe, but maybe it's because I've never experienced sleep paralysis myself.

horror,3bila0,TheStaceyBeth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"Some brief thoughts with minor spoilers.  I was entertained by the movie for the most part. I will say that I actually was a fan of Room 237 so I went into The Nightmare expecting loose ends and open to interpretation stuff.  There was an episode of one of the later generation Twilight Zone episodes called ""The Shadow Man"" or something like that and that's what most of this reminded me of.  I wish they had interviewed some medical professionals, though.  There is one part where a guy is describing his experience and how his girlfriend wakes up and freaks out and reports having a dream that was similar to his experience he was having and at that point I just thought ""bullshit"".

I also really like the ""Axis"" sequels, which are just hilarious.   Really, Retro Puppet Master is the only one I don't like. It felt like a particularly awful Doctor Who episode.

Curse used a lot of footage from the previous films to show the puppets in action, which is cheap as all hell."

horror,3bg8fc,HeroRobb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:50:33 2015 UTC,I loved it
horror,3bg8fc,achancesw,2,Tue Jun 30 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"Tons of great stories here, but as far as audiobooks go, nothing beats World War Z.  It's a zombie tale told through the eyes of the survivors interview style. And these survivors are played by an all-star cast: Mark Hamill, Henry Rollins, Nathan Fillion, John Turturo, Simon Pegg,  Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, and many others. I don't think anything even comes close to this, regardless of the genre.   Not sure about Audible, but the physical CD set is very popular and easy to find. Surprisingly cheap too"
horror,3bg8fc,kamatacci,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:50:27 2015 UTC,"I listened to Joe Hill's 20th Century Ghosts, from my library and really enjoyed it. You might also see if your library has Hoopla. I listened to At The Mountains of Madness and it was awesome. There's some other H.P. Lovecraft on there too."
horror,3bg8fc,Trogpint,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"I drive over 3 hours everyday between my commute to class and back home again. I've faced this exact problem. Horror audiobooks that aren't complete crap are hard to come by. My tastes generally drift toward slow burn, story driven, and disturbing horror.  My top finds so far are (all available on Audible) A Good and Happy Child, Your House is on Fire Your Children All Gone, and collections of short stories by Harland Ellison (read by the author himself!). 14 is another good one, but it's more horror flavored mystery adventure. I'd describe it as ""Diet Lovecraft"", but it's still very good."

horror,3bg8fc,Onefortheisland,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:00:29 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend In the Tall Grass or Road Rage by Stephen King and Joe Hill. Both are excellent. They're both on the shorter side, but I think they're still good.   If you're looking for something longer, I liked ""20th Century Ghosts"" by Joe Hill.   It you're truly not squeamish at all, you might like ""Ancestor"" by Scott Sigler. Most of Sigler's stuff is on the bloody side, if you're into that.   John Saul is another good, underrated horror author. A bunch of his stuff is available on Audible. ""Shadows"" and ""Guardian"" are particularly good."
horror,3bg8fc,icemanistheking,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:33:56 2015 UTC,"My enjoyment of audiobooks is often greatly affected by the voice talent of the narrator. Having said that, Neverland by Douglas Clegg and Sandman Slim by Richard Kadrey were both excellent. Neverland is southern gothic/horror, and Sandman Slim is more urban fantasy, but should easy for horror fans to get into.   Others I've listened to and enjoyed: The Ruins by Scott Smith The Terror by Dan Simmons (warning: the only audiobook version I know is abridged, but very well narrated) The Halloween Man by Douglas Clegg The Girl with all the Gifts by M.R. Carey (less horror, more zombie apocalypse drama) The Boy Who Drew Monsters by Keith Donahue"

They are edging more towards radio drama-style plays recently. The Black Tapes podcast is quite new, and very good so far. Campfire Radio Theatre presents original plays in old-time radio drama style. The Classic Tales podcast often has older horror, and is read by a professional voice actor. Knifepoint Horror is excellent, stripped-down simple readings. I've only just started listening to Yara's Haunt, but that's very good too. Those are a few of my favourites."

horror,3bes0j,spooky-clinic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"The worst part, which the article doesn't mention, is that this is only the first in Micahel Bay's ""The Birds THRILLOGY"" series.  First, we get ""The Birds."" An idyllic California town is beset upon by flocks of avian attackers. Residents flee in terror as death and gore rain down from the skies. Of course, the birds explode on impact with solid structures, so cars and homes are destroyed in a bloodbath of swirling metal and glass and feathers while the pounding sounds of Linkin Park reverberate. One sexy scientist (played by Abigail Ratchford) theorizes that the attacking birds are not of this world, and invents a device that can stop them. It's up to Mark Whalberg and Will Smith to get the device to the top of the tallest structure in a 55-mile radius. Can they survive?  ""The Birds II: Beak of the Mayhem"" takes place six months later. The events of the first film totally forgotten, the town has rebuilt and life is good for our sexy heroes. But what's this? A dark cloud has appeared over nearby Mega City, signalling the Birds have returned! They're madder than Hell and they're not gonna take this anymore! It doesn't matter that Abigail Ratchford thwarted their attack before because of reasons. Flocks of seagulls attack highrise office buildings, which come crashing down as if they were make of popsicle sticks. The military is called in and begin firing on flocks of Birds, but that just makes them angrier. President Kelsey Grammar authorizes a nuclear strike against Mega City, but Abigail Ratchford thinks she can stop the birds if Mark Whalberg and Will Smith can get her to the top of the tallest structure in a 500-mile radius. Can they survive?  ""The Birds III: Talon of the Storm"" is more of the same bullshit, but with a new set of boobs running around. An ancient artifact has been uncovered, revealing The Birds have been here all along! Maybe there are some scenes in Hong Kong for some reason to court the lucrative Chinese box office? It still makes over $1 Billion, ensuring the continuation of this garbage ""franchise"" for the next ten years."

What's also fairly vague but I think a pretty good assumption based on her telling of this story,  this girl didn't see A Serbian Film sitting on the guy's shelf and immediately and in no uncertain terms express disgust and doubts about the taste of her date.   I made a comment about seeing it as we started a comedy...   ""Polarizing"" isn't a strong enough term for something like ASF.  Anything but full on anaphylactic shock at mention of it is practically an endorsement.   Occam's Razor says this guy thought he was being an edgy bad boy and ultimately he was likely just being stupid and it backfired.  There's no mention in this clip the ages of those involved...click through...20F and 24M.  Yeah, he's being stupid and she was in over her head and neither one of them have a clue about anything.  Yeah, it's a sick idea but there's no way of knowing if he was serious or if she has a clue if he was being serious, was actually turned on or just being dumb.  Neither one of them are done cooking between their ears.  As a comparison, according to Dr. Drew people who use food during sex, taking a cue from 9 1/2 Weeks, etc., have deep seated psychosexual problems and has asserted on more than one occasion that people who do this as more than a goof, who actually enjoy it, have problems and it's a red flag.  Almost anything deviating from normal can be interpreted as a red flag and indicative of emotional problems expressing themselves in possibly damaging ways.  Girl saying baby talk to you, folks dressing goth, liking it in the butt, wanting to do it in the butt, going ass-to-mouth.  All these things can mean something...except when they don't.  I had an ex fiancee who told me about her rape fantasy once.  No too ways about it, that B was crazy and bad news.  This kid might be but I bet he's just stupid.  Or maybe none of this is true at all because a lot of B.S. gets posted to reddit to stir people up.  There are gold-plated, gilded posts such as this that are complete fabrications by bored kids going for lulz."
horror,3bh6ru,BurnetRhoades,2,Mon Jun 29 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"Well then, the counter to this would be someone fantasizing about raping or necrophilia doesn't mean they actually want to rape women or dead bodies then.  Most of the arguments against portrayal of these fantasies in film and media are therefore no more worrisome than the ""incredibly common"" rape fantasy of of women.  Regardless, it doesn't matter when the results are the same and determining whether she was legally raped or it was just rough roleplay comes down to ""he said, she said.""  It's fucked up."

He has had enough of the bullshit he has gone through and instead of talking (which he never does) or just going for the kill, he sighs.

If you want the story to be about the game, you start with everyone arriving,  like Clue. If it's about her, then it's missing a final confrontation.  The point at which the movie currently ends should be the impetus for a final confrontation between her and the host."

I can't recommend this film enough. A flimsy story and not the greatest actors, but the scenery from the locations in Turkey is unbelievably gorgeous and there are a lot of really cool in-camera effects used in the film. Cool music too. If you like Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain then you'll probably enjoy this.  Black Roses - A heavy metal band travels around small towns playing shows to their rabid fans who leave the concert a little more rabid than before.  Trick or Treat - Sammi Curr died before his final album was released, but that won't stop him from reaping it's benefits  Rock-n-Roll Nightmare with Jon Mikel Thor is not a good movie.

Legitimately made me uncomfortable. But beautifully shot with an amazing performance."
horror,3bhka8,kamatacci,2,Mon Jun 29 07:59:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! Will check it out. Do you have any more suggestions?
horror,3bhka8,kamatacci,2,Mon Jun 29 08:02:53 2015 UTC,"Sion Sono is great. Check out all of his stuff, even though he is more mainstream and hasn't been in horror for awhile. His Exte: Hair Extensions (2007) was more traditional J-Horror with his own weird touch. Why Don't You Play In Hell (2013) is about Yakuza making a samurai film, but most genre fans would probably enjoy it. And Love Exposure (2008) is a must watch. It's four hours long and has nothing to do with horror, but it has a similar vibe to Cold Fish.  Hopefully you know Takashi Miike. He's very similar to Sono down to being super mainstream now, but he's had a resurgence of horror lately. Lesson of the Evil (2012) is a high school slasher with a very famous and controversial scene. It shows up in gif threads alot, but I'm not gonna spoil it. Over Your Dead Body (2014) is a ghost story about a theater group which is decent enough.  Koji Shiraishi is still making horror films. He directed the excellent Noroi/The Curse (2005) which is a must watch if you haven't seen it yet. He loves found footage, and has been doing it long before the recent boom. However, all of his new movies star Japanese pop Idols. They are still horror, but they seem too much like a star vehicle  to take too seriously. But if you are interested, Shirome (2010) isn't too bad from that ""genre"".  Even the director of The Ring is on the j-pop bandwagon as of recently. Monsterz (2014) was just a huge hit here, which is a remake of a Korean film. More of an action thriller. I haven't seen the original but the new one isn't anything special.  Finally, if you want a laugh, watch Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead (2012). It's exactly as it sounds."

And they turned up the camp so much with each film, it just fell apart in it's own silliness.

He is a little awkward at times but the way I always read it was becoming Spider-man gave him more confidence and the all out dorkiness evened out into a charming awkwardness.

It's scary in an unnerving sort of way, and kind of had a similar feel to The Shining to me.

Several shared tropes - a family with a child taken by the ""other side,"" a psychic with ghost hunter comrades and a wealth of esoteric paranormal knowledge, and an apparent solution that fails and leads to a bigger climax - but they have different ways of executing these tropes, as well as different story structures and moods.

Kevin Gruetert was, at the time, tapped to direct the (then) next Paranormal Activity, but due to the success of Saw 6 under his direction, and a weird clause in his contract, he had to drop Paranormal Activity and start work on Saw 7. The pre-production was sort of rushed because he came in late, plus the shoe-horning in of the 3D. The movie was almost set up to fail, but the last 10 minutes really ramped up the quality of the film.

horror,3bcwww,BurnetRhoades,2,Sun Jun 28 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"The cult aspect of The Following was pretty entertaining I thought.  It was a great looking show and Kevin Bacon delivered a top notch, emotional performance.  It was so infuriating how stupid the FBI and his character were written, however.  He repeatedly was written to make the same rookie mistakes over and over and over again, nearly getting himself killed, caught multiple times and endangering the lives of everyone around him.    What was unsettling about how effective the cult members were was they showed, fairly realistically I think, how much damage an individual or group of people could do if they were totally committed to just walking into an everyday situation and killing people.  Total conviction is a scary force (as we see on the news).    But I would have preferred a villain written to be smarter than the smart people trying to catch him, not simply less dumb than the people trying to catch him.  And there's a difference.  One apparently lost on Kevin Williamson."

And there's a difference. One apparently lost on Kevin Williamson.   I think Hannibal is a good, subtle take on that. His psychological manipulation has a distinctly cultish vibe to it, with a charismatic and highly intelligent leader who is more like a motivational coach, inspiring others to kill purely for the pleasure of killing. He also repeatedly diverts attention from himself while being a highly prolific serial killer. And although we know he'll eventually be caught from the existent canon, from the point of view of the series itself it's far from apparent."
horror,3bcwww,BurnetRhoades,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:22:47 2015 UTC,"Totally.  For a while there I was watching both series at the same time and often found myself comparing Joe and Hannibal and there was no contest.  There were a lot of parallels between Joe and Hardy's relationship and Hannibal and Graham's relationship, and the later was likely inspiration for the former.    The dissociative moments shown by Hannibal are also far more chilling, making the emotional moments far more resonant and moving in their later climactic episodes."

I'd love to see it remade for a modern audience. I think it would fare better on a small budget than a large one, but there's just so much more you can do, technology wise, on a small budget these days. The premise isn't based on special effects anyway.  The past few years, scientific exploration of the potentially healing effects of radically mind-altering substances and practices is finally possible again, after being at a standstill since the early seventies. Transcententalism is also a theme that's been explored a lot recently, but not that take on it. Altered States is a film about an obsessive who takes it way too far."

horror,3bdc2j,Explosivo412,2,Sun Jun 28 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Here is the Cinefex article written to revisit interviews with Bran Farren (SFX creator for Altered States).  ""If Outland represents the death throes of optical compositing, Altered States could be said to herald the digital age. To create the necessary wow-factor for the movie’s finale – in which a deformed and tortured Hurt struggles down a corridor, banging the walls and phase-shifting constantly from one cosmic form to another – Bran Ferren was brought in to enhance the stage photography with computer effects.  Ferren’s first task was to isolate Hurt from the background, which he did using a ‘computer-assisted rotoscope system’. This created ultra-smooth matte elements, which he then filled with computer-generated particles. Crucially, the particles were mapped to the contours of Hurt’s body to give a pseudo-3D effect ‘so it actually appeared to be wrapped around him rather than just being matted over him.’  Once generated, the particle imagery was plotted out on to paper in black-and-white, rephotographed on an animation stand and coloured with traditional optical effects. The process sounds clunky now, but at the time it was the only way to get the data out of the computer and on to film.""  Computer generated particles were used to achieve an effect that practical composting effects wouldn't have achieved. In my opinion at least, that makes the special effects in this movie at least partly computer generated (and super primitive CGI)."

horror,3bdc2j,The_Dead_See,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"I would prefer it if they remade a few of the films that didn't really hit me as well as I hoped: I always thought the ending of The Cube didn't make much sense morally/philosophically (I don't get why the people that survive actually survive compared to those that do not - happy to have it explained!) but I guess that's more sci-fi.   I would really like to see them remake 24 Days Later that's more consistent and has character arcs, as they basically just added a militaristic theme at the end, from nowhere, with lots of rape threat. They also take away all the woman's badassery, and make the guy into Schwarzenegger, which never sit right with me.  So it would be nice if they either remade the beginning to fit the end, or the end to fit the beginning, if that makes sense, so the woman is strong all along, or the guy is. See also Sunshine which started so well, imo, but massively tanked at the end.  The whole Resident Evil franchise could do with a remake, to align it with the games, just to see where that goes.  I could also do with another Dawn of the Dead remake somewhere down the line, that keeps the thoughtfulness of the original, as the underlying themes of materialism kind of got lost in the Snyder remake, but it would be cool to update all the gore and setting to a modern time.  The Divide, which is kind of horror, I would also like to see remade, because the sci-fi element that's almost immediately dropped was so much cooler than the direction the movie went in afterwards."

horror,3baiu3,girlsjiggle,7,Sat Jun 27 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"I quite enjoyed it although the segway into rot-gore felt a bit of a cheap way to ratchet up the horror quotient. There has been a real zeitgeist around rotting women in horror the last few years - something to do with men's fear of the visceralness of women's bodies perhaps.  I wish they had kept exploring the audition stuff because that felt powerful, intriguing and wonderfully symbolic of how we are all actors putting on a show to survive and get by in this capitalistic jungle world. They should have kept digging into that and getting her to do weirder and weirder things. It could have got quite surreal and abstract even."
horror,3baiu3,annihilatrixxx,7,Sat Jun 27 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"She had to rot/die to be reborn, though. It was a powerful statement on beauty and behavior standards placed particularly on women are impossible for a human to achieve. She had to slough off her humanity and become something else to obtain the kind of celebrity we lionize. Celebrities don't even look like themselves when they're made into objects for consumption. Would totally watch a different movies featuring escalating auditions, though."

horror,3baiu3,annihilatrixxx,2,Sun Jun 28 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"True, I think I gave it a pass because I was considering the rotting girl trope over the rotting to be reborn one, and accordingly comparing it to Contracted, for instance, rather than Honeymoon (which I also enjoyed). I was just happy to see a rotting girl with some agency at the end. Have you seen Compliance? It's not horror, but does feature the sort of voyeuristic psychological torture you describe. Unfortunately, lots of the actual horror movies that examine escalating behavior/psychological breakdown catalyzed by some authority figure(s) or an audience are cheesy as fuck. Another notable exception would be the White Bear episode of Black Mirror, but that had a whole different feel, premise and outcome than Starry Eyes."

Quite a lineup there.  I enjoyed Eden Lake the most. The tension built up before shit hits the fan is great, especially in the diner at the beginning with the waitress becoming more hostile as she defends her kids' behavior.  Antichrist and Martyrs were like ""whoa,"" but in different ways. A lot to mull over, don't know if I've fully processed it all, I guess.   I understand what Irreversible was doing, with the reverse order viewing, but I can't help but feel that stole a little bit from the narration.   The Tunnel was good, creepy fun, especially since it's still a free download, can't beat that price tag!  I'm trying to get through some of the more ""challenging"" films around.

I started with The Collector, which I quite enjoyed because I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff, and I'll watch the sequel next.   I also finally got around to watching 28 Days Later and I don't know why it took me so long - probably because I had myself convinced I'd already seen it. The film style was quite a trip back in time (and seeing London circa 2002), but it was a pretty great zombie movie and just a good movie in general.  In a complete quality drop, I also watched Amusement because it was on TV at some point. Holy moly, that was not a great movie. I will say that I thought the clown segment was strong as a standalone piece - one of my favourite old urban legends brought to life quite effectively. The rest of the movie was...it felt unfinished, basically. The villain was almost cartoonish and his motivations weren't fleshed out at all, and the section after the initial three, where all the characters come together, was pretty shitty.   Not horror, but I also watched the documentary Bully this week, and it was downright horrific in a very different way.

Salma Hayek is a prostitute trying to escape her apartment, killing dozens and dozens of would-be assassins, including hitmen, other hookers, and other assorted colorful characters.  The director is an obvious fan of Kill Bill, and this is mostly a non-stop barrage of gun violence.

If you want one that most people don't know about, try Ghoul and The Hunted.  Ghoul is paranormal stuff and The Hunted is very under the radar, but the ending is weak.  Really scary vibe in the Hunted though.  Definitely worth a viewing.  Atrocious is surprisingly good cause it goes completely in a different direction midway."

horror,3ba8no,foundfootagefan,3,Tue Jun 30 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"Ghostwatch:  sort of a mockumentary from the 90s.  A British news network does a live broadcast of a poltergeist haunting; things go awry.  S&amp;amp;amp;Man:  really interesting.  It's structured as a documentary about the making of extremely gory horror films (e.g. August Underground).  The main subplot, which involves the investigation of a fictional director who goes by ""S&amp;amp;Man"" and may or may not be making real snuff films, is fictional.  However, the rest of the interviews are real, and it's cool to see how these types of movies are made.  Home Movie:  two parents slowly realize their children are psychopaths.   It takes the audience about 2 minutes to figure this out, leaving viewers to wonder how these idiots managed to live to adulthood.  Europa Report:  pretty standard (but still entertaining!) scifi horror.  A team of astronauts, including Dexter Morgan's brother, travel to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons that may be inhabited by living organisms.  Fun fact:  Europa really may support life!  Its surface is covered by a 10(?)-mile-thick layer of ice that sits on top of an ocean.  YellowBrickRoad:  many years ago, an entire town's worth of people walked up a certain pathway and disappeared.  Documentarians want to explore the path to discover what really happened, are somehow surprised when weird shit starts happening."
horror,3ba8no,Nickweed,3,Sat Jun 27 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"LOL @ your description of Home Movie. Sometimes characters seem to behave like idiots because they don't have all the information that the viewer has, but these parents were just bafflingly stupid within the film's rules."
horror,3ba8no,foundfootagefan,3,Sun Jun 28 17:05:10 2015 UTC,It got ridiculous when you saw them encouraging violent hobbies. The parents were a spiritual adviser and a psychologist! They're trained to recognize signs of mental illness! Like there's denial and then there's idiocy.  Still a pretty effective movie though.
horror,3ba8no,Nickweed,2,Sun Jun 28 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Saw the last 3, but Ghostwatch! I've been meaning to see that one.  Really thought YellowBrickRoad was going to be horror and got totally engulfed in it then got disappointed when it turned out to just be about drugs.  I liked it, but was upset that a review I read said it was horror."
horror,3ba8no,mikewerbe,2,Sat Jun 27 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"YellowBrickRoad probably would have been better if it were about drugs. As it stands, the plot has no actual explanation. There's a good analysis here if you are a fan. I didn't particularly enjoy it but that's probably because I thought it was going to be an isolationist, almost lovecraftian horror when it turned into a more psychological, character driven story with a super vague ending."

And since it's a Michael Mann film, it's obviously the best looking. It would be the best shot entry in the Hannibal franchise period if it weren't for the TV show."
horror,3b8u1u,Drexx,8,Sat Jun 27 04:45:35 2015 UTC,"Fantastic movie. Best use of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ever.  Also I believe the director was approached to do the Red Dragon ""remake"" of his own film. He said he made that movie already, so no."

horror,3b8u1u,BurnetRhoades,5,Sat Jun 27 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"No one mentioning Tom Noonan? I really enjoyed him in this movie, and because of his performance I perk up every time I see him in something else. While I do love this movie, I'm not sure it's aged that well, with it's Miami Vice look shining through."
horror,3b8u1u,tariffless,2,Sat Jun 27 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"Everything is coming back to the '80s.  This is cinema firmly from the era it was created, like a lot of great '70s movies, '60s movies, etc.  Noonan is a great Dolarhyde.  He's not the killer from the book but that's okay because he's a more sympathetic, accessible, dimensional and more human monster than the book.   The scene where he finally delivers his ""Francis is gone,"" line is one of my favorites in the film.  I think that Dennis Farina is still my favorite Crawford too."
horror,3b8u1u,tariffless,2,Sat Jun 27 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"Tom Noonan   To be honest, Brian Cox is the only thing I remember about Manhunter in any significant detail. I did love Tom Noonan as The Stewmaker in The Blacklist, though."
horror,3b8u1u,BurnetRhoades,9,Sat Jun 27 06:50:35 2015 UTC,I certainly did prefer Cox's portrayal of Hannibal over Hopkins'.
horror,3b8u1u,BurnetRhoades,8,Sat Jun 27 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  Until seeing what Mads has done with the role in NBC's Hannibal, Cox was the definitive Lecter for me.  edit: Mads and Cox would have eaten someone who acted like Hopkins"
horror,3b8u1u,TheAll-Pro,3,Sat Jun 27 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Mads has been excellent in the role, I couldn't really imagine someone else playing the role anytime soon. It is funny that Hugh Dancy auditioned for Hannibal Rising years back though."
horror,3b8u1u,tariffless,2,Sat Jun 27 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"I ended up skipping that one.  This (the NBC series) is my first exposure to Dancy.  Like with Cox and Hannibal, I couldn't picture anyone but William Peterson doing justice to Graham, but Dancy has been so excellent.  Still, this film has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, since seeing it premiere on HBO.  I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched it over the years.    Having read Red Dragon now I can say I agree with most all of the changes made for Manhunter, including the improvements to dialog in particular.  Pretty much only Hannibal's lines remained intact and didn't need much of any tweaks."
horror,3b8u1u,agoMiST,6,Sat Jun 27 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"I preferred Hopkins until he became a cliche. That said, I still can't deny his powerhouse performance in Silence of the Lambs, Cox doesn't even come close imo. Much more scarier and menacing, where as Cox just came off as extremely intelligent, if not a little bit full of himself. Mads is doing great stuff on the tv series however"
horror,3b8u1u,BurnetRhoades,5,Sat Jun 27 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"That touches on why I preferred Cox. To me, Hopkins came across as someone deliberately trying to affect an air of menace. He was too theatrical for my taste, like a caricature of a serial killer. I preferred Cox's relatively normal facial expressions and tone of voice. It's a thing I have about serial killers, and psychopaths in general-- the most unsettling/interesting thing about them is how normal they appear on the outside."
horror,3b8u1u,scruffycoyote,2,Sat Jun 27 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Hopkins' performance is overtly sinister and threatening whereas Cox's had more of a 'lull you into a false sense of security' vibe"

One night my husband came to stay the night with me and brought my favorite movie, for a sorta date. My heart doctor, the man who saved my life, came in to check on me one last time for the day.

Basically, I'm usually grossed out by bodily substances that aren't red and/or don't come out of wounds, though I'm less grossed out when the context is sexual, as is at times the case with Edward Lee. I don't like feeling grossed out, though. I'd rather be desensitized.   When it comes to blood and gore, for instance, I can't even remember when I found it gross. These days, I find it beautiful. I prefer that. People who whine about the shallowness of ""shock value"" must never have gotten to the point of being able to appreciate the complexity of a wound on an aesthetic level."

Spent a lot of money on autographs and got to see a screening of Creepshow in a packed theater with people that knew the movie line-by-line.  I think the con didn't do too well because it's since boiled down to screening some old horror movies and getting the newscasters from Dawn of the Dead to recreate the opening scene."

horror,3b7q5g,Bomberhead,6,Fri Jun 26 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"It's a slow film, but I'll be damned if I didn't thoroughly enjoy it myself. It felt far more realistic than most zombie flicks, that's for sure. Nice finale too. I recommend it."
horror,3b7q5g,comichorrorweirdo,3,Fri Jun 26 17:42:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that was a great film.  Towards the end that scene in the car is just fucking nasty and claustrophobic.  I almost lost my mind just watching that.  I also thought for the first time about how brushing your teeth is a simple pleasure that I take for granted.  That movie was so damned good.  I tried to find other movies by Gardner but was not successful.

The Battery was pretty well received.   Also yes, all I could think about in the car scene was how hot, smelly, smoky, and cramped it would have to be. It actually made my skin crawl a bit."
horror,3b7q5g,MisfitNiq,2,Fri Jun 26 18:55:22 2015 UTC,Gardner has had issues getting another movie made. The piracy on this movie was out of control and it ended up being a bit of a failure. The filmmakers were forced to go back to their day jobs. I remember reading an article a while back where the filmmakers expressed their frustration about it all.
horror,3b7q5g,JohnsHorrorCorner,2,Sat Jun 27 16:14:28 2015 UTC,A friend of mine (from MoviesFilmsandFlix.com) wrote a very positive review of The Battery. He really appreciated what they did with that miniscule budget.  When the budgets are low we have a better shot at writing that favors good character development.

It was like a cheap knock-off.    The stories themselves were pretty good but it didn't have the style of the first.

horror,3b3s35,KallistiGAD,6,Thu Jun 25 18:59:09 2015 UTC,I loved this documentary! I'm a huge fan of 1970s horror and it was nice to have some historical context on it. It was a time of excess and it definitely was reflected in the excessive amounts of blood and violence. Really loved the insight this movie had and it still managed to be kinda scary by showing certain clips. That Last House on the Left clip always makes me peek through one eye.
horror,3b3s35,Teegertott,4,Thu Jun 25 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't even realize the impact news media could have on horror movies until watching their explanation of violent horror in the 70's. It seems obvious now. Audiences were so used to seeing violent images of the Vietnam war on their television (the first war to really have full color images of violence widely available to the general public) that the horror movies had to up the ante in order to scare and shock the public. I actually kind of think the resurgence of zombie (and outbreak) films of the 2000's may have been influenced at least a little by fear of terrorism and the destruction of the ""old American way of life"", fears repeatedly brought up by media (during the time zombie movies were popular) quite frequently."
horror,3b3s35,silent_h,8,Thu Jun 25 19:21:38 2015 UTC,I was really disappointed with this doc. I saw it recommended here and was excited to watch it but it seemed really poorly made (especially the voice overs) and left me wanting further analysis. I was able to come to some interesting thoughts on my own but the film just barely led me there.  Cool that other folks like it but I much preferred A History of Horror by Mark Gatiss.
horror,3b3s35,silent_h,5,Thu Jun 25 20:02:19 2015 UTC,I can respect that. This documentary is the first I have seen that looked at horror in the analytical sense (rather than a nostalgic sense)  but I am extremely interested in any other suggestions which analyze the genre so I will definately be checking out A History of Horror (Edit: removed the link for copy write rule but is available on youtube).   What thoughts did the documentary manage to stir up? And do you have any other horror film documentaries you would suggest?
horror,3b3s35,usedthrone,3,Thu Jun 25 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in a genre analysis of horror, partly because I think it really lends itself to this type of analysis. As in, how does the genre change with time, or what sub-genres exist and are popular during certain periods (both popular for filmmakers to create and for audience reception)? How are societal horrors, fears, or anxieties reflected in media? Again, the film touched on these, like how what the zombies in Romero's films represent changed from film to film, but I would have liked a deeper investigation or maybe a more central thesis to the whole documentary. I can't remember any other particular thoughts I had at the moment, and this might sound pretentious, but I just remember being more entertained thinking on my own with the film as background then actually digesting what it presented. Maybe that was the point.  A Pervert's Guide to Cinema and A Pervert's Guide to Ideology did a more interesting job of this type of analysis although they weren't limited to horror. Zizek discusses Psycho and They Live in these films, respectively (among other horror films I can't remember, I'm sure). Other then those two films, I can't think of any other documentaries featuring horror analysis I'd recommend. It's mostly cinema studies essays on horror that have been entertaining me of late. I do think there is a big opportunity for more horror docs though!"
horror,3b3s35,dualactioncomplete,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that there should be more horror documentaries and the genre deserves a more thorough analysis. What kinds of trends have you noticed over the past 5 years? For me, the 2010's have seemed like a bit of a mess as far as horror films go, with no real defining trends emerging. I haven't really been able to identify a pattern in themes or styles of recent films but that may be because we're still in the middle of the decade. There's been some found footage and good indie films so maybe horror is returning to its low budget roots. Thoughts?"

horror,3b7zws,KallistiGAD,3,Fri Jun 26 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"Top left of the page: Dreadit Movie Guide  I post it in almost every recommendation thread if it isn't asking for a specific type of movie that we don't already have a list for.

Over in other technical subreddits related to cameras or computers or whatever there will be stickies or menu items for noobs coming in asking their typical questions that fall under FAQ territory.  They won't look around, they don't absorb information that's right in front of them and they don't know how to google...which begs the question how did they find reddit and how did they find the subreddit in the first place, but such is the irony of the noob."

Sure, 1 out of every 3 new people might ignore a stickied recommendation thread and post their own but they would be swiftly linked back to the sticky. Either way, it would clear up some of the thread clutter on this subreddit. Plus, there is no reason not to attempt a simple fix. It's literally as simple as a mod making a sticky thread called ""The Movie Recommendation Thread"" or something and people checking it every so often to actually respond to recommendation requests. At least give new members of the community the benefit of the doubt."

It takes time and money to put a short film like this together and not many people understand the process. That being said, I enjoyed your short. I didn't think it was the greatest thing out there, but it was entertaining. Keep on working and doing what you enjoy. For that, you will always have my respect...whatever that may mean to you."

horror,3b509n,horrorinpureform,3,Fri Jun 26 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the actors were pretty good, the sound editing was pretty well done too (minus the jump scare sounds). Could have used a bit more of a surprise factor cause the scares were telegraphed from a mile away.   The only thing that needs a lot of work in my opinion was the camera work / cinematography. The pointless movements and pans were really distracting. Like in the opening, every scene has either a pan or a zoom. What's the point of the camera moving as he is scrubbing the floor or when we see the door after the doorbell rings? Do you feel they contribute something to the mood?"

horror,3b5gbf,EdguyFan,8,Fri Jun 26 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"The trailer didn't impress me, but I kinda dug this opening. I believe the first episode was directed by Wes Craven himself, and I think it shows. I did roll my eyes when they showed the throat-cut partially off-screen, but it's TV so I understand. I don't think MTV is really a great fit for this show, but I am looking forward to watching it. I think it could do better on another channel, it might not get the support it needs for a 2nd season."
horror,3b5gbf,skarp7c1,3,Fri Jun 26 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"IMDB lists Jamie Travis as the director. The 8-minute clip was OK. I didn't have high expectations. I liked how the killer taunts, but it lacks the Ghost voice from the films. Gore is OK, it's MTV I did't expect The Walking Dead level here, so I agree with you there. There's a lack of suspense & dread, it all just happens. Perhaps it works better with the intended teen demographic.   I have a bit of nitpicking to make. Viral YouTube ClipLicious video changes format shown on different devices in landscape and portrait modes, time stamp in the player not moving while video plays, not how it works. Poor attention to detail, especially it being the focus of the opening scene. Twitter Chirpster trending... I really don't know why they cannot use real sites. Jabs at lock screens and voice commands when needed as plot devices. I don't love the new mask, was hoping for The Strangers effect, but it's only 8 minutes I might warm up to it."

And yeah, I pretty much agree with you, personally I think the whole viral video/fake websites thing is corny and is really only due to it being on MTV -- it's trying to be hip and current. I thought Scream 4 did a great job modernizing the series while still keeping it old-school. I still have mixed feelings in general about it, especially the redesigned Ghostface, but I did like the opening more than I was expecting."

Brunette Girl: I don't know. It looks pretty cheesy. All of these MTV shows seem to overly pander to teens.  Hologram Jamie Kennedy: That's the brilliance of horror shows. You see, there are 37 rules for surviving a horror TV show based on a movie. 1- Be the protagonist. 2- Don't cause huge problems that back the writers to a wall, they'll kill you to avoid keep the plot going...  Robot Jamie Kennedy : Beep boop bop beeeep  Hologram Jamie Kennedy: That's right Robot Jamie Kennedy, 3- be careful that the writers will introduce a huge amount of supernatural features not in the original movie.

horror,3b5gbf,mardfet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"If you want me to be scared for the victims, you need to make them likable, or at least relate-able, characters.  See: Drew Barrymore in original.  I don't know how old this girl was supposed to be.  Was she a mansion-owning adult with a high-school-level online social life?  Either way, she seemed unpleasant.  Regarding building tension, it would have worked better had it not been obvious that it wasn't Tyler texting.  They could have shown him on screen beginning to text her while she entered the house, and had the texts start believable and flirty before slowly getting creepier and creepier.  I don't know, I probably would have found a reason to complain about that too."

horror,3b4qnb,Sodiepawp,17,Thu Jun 25 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'd personally prefer if clickbait was banned, no multi-page lists."
horror,3b4qnb,horrorinpureform,5,Thu Jun 25 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"Clickbait. It's getting big in this sub. I'm not talking so much the links to a list with descriptions, but how often Cracked is posted, for example. Those of us with poor internet don't really get along with the multipage format, and the journalism at times is mediocre at best.   Cracked is actually pretty low on the list of problem sites for me. They tend to have three or four items per page, unlike some shitty sites that are literally just one, four-line paragraph per page.    I was hoping to hash out some opinions. If the sub in general is completely cool with the links as is, and the karma system is doing it's job, I'm fine with hushing up and going back to lurking.    I hate the clickbait, but I'm personally in favor of letting the upvotes decide."
horror,3b4qnb,littletoyboat,6,Fri Jun 26 03:22:34 2015 UTC,"I also think something should be done about the blatant advertising, especially when the user who posts it literally doesn't have anything else in their history besides that one post.

horror,3b4qnb,NO_NOT_THE_WHIP,2,Fri Jun 26 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but I want to give a little perspective from the other side.  When you make your first movie (like I just did), you probably have no budget (like I didn't). You'll do anything and everything you can to get the word out about it, because A) you're super excited about this thing you did and B) you're hoping the attention will translate into sales.  When you're at the I-finished-the-movie-now-what stage, someone will inevitably say, ""Hey, you should promote it on Reddit! Lots of viral internetting happens there.""*  If they've never heard of Reddit before, they won't understand how shitty it is that their first post is ""Look at my movie!""   Hell, I've been a Redditor for just over a year, and I still get seemingly arbitrary downvotes when I share the poster or trailer or whatever for my movie.  None of that justifies someone being a tool, just asking for upvotes or likes or whatever IMDb has. But when you have no marketing budget or connections, it's hard to know what to do.  * Direct quote."
horror,3b4qnb,littletoyboat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:43:53 2015 UTC,"I think framing it in a context in which you are looking for feedback will be much more helpful for you in the long run. If you just made your first low budget movie, it's probably got its fair share of issues since you're still learning as a filmmaker. Not to be taken personally though.. My first movie was bad. Everybody's first movie is bad because we cant all be Spielbergs and Tarantinos the first time out the gate.  And as far as translating to sales, this is the sticking point. Asking people to buy your independently produced media can be tricky because you are competing with major studio financed movies so people are going to be less likely to spend money on a first time movie. I would just promote the traditional routes...there are still film distributors out there. Have you seen some of the shit they'll release on Redbox/Netflix? There is a place for your movie, just dont shove it down people's throats, if people like it they will find it. And if they don't like it, learn from it and make your next movie better."
horror,3b4qnb,dsc89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"Hi! Sorry for the late reply.   Everything you wrote is spot on.   When I referred to ""sales,"" though, I meant selling the film to distributors. A strong social media following and mentions on movie/horror news sites will lead to higher purchase from distributors."
horror,3b4qnb,littletoyboat,2,Sun Jul 5 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"Cracked isn't the worst of it and I don't think it's posted that often.

These are all on the front for me:  20 Depraved Movies Only Truly Sick Individuals Could Enjoy (:  The 12 best heavy metal songs from horror movies  Scariest photobombs I've seen! Especially the one with the bear.. damn!  Now, there are 3 problems with banning this sort of stuff. 1) Sometimes those spam posts blow up and get a generally positive response. 2) There's no flawless way to differentiate between good content that's multi-page or list-based and ""clickbait."" 3) A user's poor internet can't be a limitation on everyone else. I wouldn't click on any of those posts but they vary in popularity and I couldn't tell you how to phrase a rule that would get rid of all 3.  Granted, I think mods could clean off some of the spammy shit from www.photos-and-computers.in/virus/most_freddy_the_13th_list.exe type junk sites. The last link I posted was to a trailer and someone snaked in to post a direct link to the .mp4, which I could've done but I didn't know we were trying to keep horror news sites from getting page views. I think it's complicated, but I'd be more in favor of a system that deterred people from trying to leech ad revenue from dreadit than one that banned a certain web page format. I think we're stuck with the karma system, even though it's far from perfect.  Or just bring back discussion-only days."
horror,3b4qnb,splattergut,2,Fri Jun 26 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"View from the other side of the fence here. I run a site and drop the occasional link into this sub for things that could be of interest (mainly editorial type articles, we publish news and reviews almost every day but I don't link to those). To be perfectly honest, I came to Dreadit hoping to drive more traffic to my site - what webmaster wouldn't want this? - but I'm genuinely enjoying the discussion and debate that happens here without the usual kind of decay into lazy argument and personal attack that seems to happen in a lot of other places. Different kind of internet, yo.  Anyway, in terms of clickbait I really hate it. The ""You'll never guess what happens next..."" titles and the 10 page lists are there for one thing only: to get clicks. Clicks=ad revenue if you use CPM (paid per impression) marketing. That is the wrong impetus for writing IMO, you should be writing based on your passions, not what drives traffic. If what you're passionate about drives traffic then your thinking is aligned with others. If you need to rely on salacious titles and your multi-pages then something is wrong.  I'll end by saying this: this sub (and Reddit in general) isn't stupid. If they see a user posting link after link to their own stuff then the upvotes won't be forthcoming. Single user spam isn't difficult to spot, nor is a single user spamming over multiple accounts. I think it's policed pretty damn well by the user base already, although it has to be said, a lot of these clickbait lists still attract the ups so not everyone objects to them so strongly."
horror,3b4qnb,DJBenz,2,Fri Jun 26 11:28:48 2015 UTC,They might be click baity but it doesn't mean the content is bad.

Peter Watts did a great short story called ""The Things"" that talks about the mindset of the creature, and how it is, in truth, just doing what it does and isn't really evil per se. My own favorite theory is that the time in the ice gave it brain damage, and it was operating at a much reduced, bestial capacity; it's normal mode of operation must have been much higher, to build spaceships and all. Dekker's kind of a mixed bag as a villian. On the one hand he's definitely evil, on the other hand that evil is serving a slightly greater good (for the moment, at least). the Predator (or Yautja) are actually text-book evil to me. Their totally selfish, self-centered, and ignorant to the validity of other ways of living and other lives.  Vampires have always been sort of the prototype ""monster-victim"". Their monsters, yes - but only because of circumstance. Of course, they can embrace their dark nature. One thing i liked about the Twilight franchise is that it shows two types of vampires: those that sort of accept this ""gift"" and fit in with humans as best they can, and those that just go full on psycho-dark."

The way I see it, it ate something that knew how to build ships.  Normally I'm really against bestial aliens that travel by space ship.  This makes no sense at all, so the revelation of Super-8 and the aliens in  Cowboys and Aliens were just stupid to me.  But with The Thing I see its use very differently.  It would be easy enough to imagine this thing having lived who knows how long.  There's no reason to believe that it made the ship it used to get to Earth.  A more logical assumption would be it ate someone(s) that flew the ship, perhaps was eating them when it crashed on Earth.  After finally being thawed out and having absorbed several people it obviously determined it didn't want to be here anymore, perhaps because of what it discovers rolling around in the heads of the people it ate.  It knows about spaceships from a previous meal and so it sets about getting itself off this rock.  Technology in this case is a means to an end that it knows about but might not put any value in beyond it being a solution to a pressing problem.    A dog or a monkey that learns to press a button to release food only thinks about or needs the button when it's hungry.  Any other time they're just going around doing their dog or monkey business."

The first movie ends with Arnold proving himself a worthy adversary by defeating the Predator, and the Predator responds by self-destructing in order to take Arnold with him while cackling like a maniac. Sore loser as well as evil.   It's more of the fact that the Predator in AVP was desparate than that it was a nice guy. In AVPR they don't exactly go easy on humans either. They're just doing whatever they can to clean up the Xenomorph problem before it can destroy a viable hunting ground (Earth)"
horror,3b33w8,franzieperez,2,Thu Jun 25 21:43:57 2015 UTC,But in Predator 2 when glover kills one the others give him a trophy.  So the only honor for predators is death or something?
horror,3b33w8,shuriken36,4,Fri Jun 26 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"It might be fairer to say that they're like people. Could be that there is some code or honor or something, but certain ones are more evil than others. Predator 1 may have been out hunting, but he was a dick too. The ones in Predator 2 and avp might be more interested in honor and such because of the other Predators nearby, they also might just be nicer or more interested in honor themselves."

horror,3b33w8,cassilda_in_carcosa,2,Thu Jun 25 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhh... the Pinhead one is a bit debateable. In the Hellraiser comics it's made pretty damn clear that he's not a very nice guy. I read the arc in question a while back but as I remember he's a spoiler So yeah, even if the comics aren’t strictly canon, he still stopped being an intriguing amoral character and just became a bit gross (in my opinion) after that.  Also Clive's repeatedly said that he'll get what's coming to him, so I don't think he was ever designed to be in any way sympathetic.  And while we’re at it, I don’t get his point about Nightbreed. Yeah, the Nightbreed are monsters, but I always thought the point of it was that they admit they’re monsters, rather than pretending to be good and noble like the real villain(s) of the piece. Human monsters pretend they’re great and everyone else is wrong, monster monsters don’t hide behind that mask. That kinda thing. In Cabal, Decker is an absolute psychopath, not this moral-crusade character this bloke wants to paint him as, and in the extended universe of Nightbreed they’re not so human-eaty… eh, again… the wider universe may or may not be canon, but when you take it into consideration it puts a different spin on things. Even if we’re only considering the films, I’d definitely consider Decker the worse of two evils.  As for the other ones – I mean, the Predator one was basically covered in the hilarious Alien vs. Predator. Not particularly surprising.  And I disagree with the vampire one on so, so many levels, if not only because the whole vampire thing is such a huge and varied genre, and that’s before you get beyond things inspired or adapted from Dracula.  The Thing one, well, I do kinda see where he’s coming from, but that’s only cos of that really cool short story about The Thing from its perspective. Does anyone else know what I’m talking about? I think I found it through reddit or something and it’s a great story that’s had a lasting impression on me. Anyway, it covered much the same idea and had a sympathetic insight into the mindset of an alien being programmed to act a certain way and stranded on a strange planet. Really cool."

horror,3b4zf0,mclovinsgirl,2,Fri Jun 26 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"If I had never heard of Jim Jones and Jonestown, I probably would have loved this film. 90% of the film was based on what happened there. Hell, I had watched a Jonestown documentary a few days before I watched the sacrament and it was like the took all the reenactment scenes, recanted everyone, and changed everyone's name. Some parts were exactly the same, scene for scene.   I find cult films extremely fascinating because they are somewhat based on reality, which is pretty damn scary if you think about it. I think this was was a little too inspired by real events and lacked creativity."

horror,3b4zf0,rvlution,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:47:33 2015 UTC,I loved this movie. A lot of people gave it a bad review because he simply recreated Jonestown. I've listened to the recording of Jim Jones giving out the kool-aid to his followers (you can find it on youtube) and it's quite unnerving. This movie basically filled in what happens between arriving and the end. Of course it doesn't portray what really happened but it gives you a view into those final days. It's tenses and wonderfully done imo.
horror,3b4zf0,MeadyViking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:03:01 2015 UTC,I think some of the reviews had to do with that it was pretty much exactly the story of Jonestown but it acts like it's an original story.

I imagined the actors sitting around, bored, in scary make up for hours waiting to get the cameras right.  Then i would imagine them doing the scene over and over again, messing it up, laughing and feeling ridiculous about it.  In every horror movie, the people behind the scenes are usually laughing and having a great time.  Just imagine that things like this happen in all of the scariest horror scenes ever made.

horror,3b68sy,SpaceLeek,3,Fri Jun 26 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"Lol, don't feel bad. It triggered your anxiety response, made some fleshy, pulpy pathway in your brain and now the stimuli gives you the same response.  I have the same thing. Mine is ventriloquist dummies. When I was like 5, I was watching TV and the trailer for Magic came on. I was alone, in the basement with barely any lights on and it scared the living crap out of me. I remember running up the stairs, being completely numb and feeling like I had acid or metal in my mouth. It was awful.  How do you get over it? You don't, usually. It's just a trigger. You anticipate it'll happen whenever you're around that trigger. You'll probably get a tingle down your spine, a little jolt of electricity through your brain and, despite the fact that it feels like shit and makes you feel like you're about a foot tall, nothing happens.  Really, that's the whole point of horror. The kind of reaction you're talking about would make sense if it was something dangerous. People who have those kinds or reactions to snakes and spiders are reacting to something real and dangerous. The fun of horror is that you get that little rush but nothing really happens. However frightened it makes you, you're not in real danger. It's like sparring is to fighting; it's just a simulation. You might get a bit shaken afterwards, but you're not in serious danger.  Enjoy it. It's fun. Magic is fun...when you're dead!!!!  I'm 42 years old and still can't be in a room with a goddamn dummy. At the very least, Sinister made the same kind of huge impression on you and is something remarkable for that. How many things can you say that about? How many things in your life have changed your perspective, your emotions and, unfortunately, your sleeping habits, that much?  This subreddit is full of posts about people who just can't find a movie that gives them the kind of rush you got off of Sinister. You got the rush. Technically, you win at horror!  Tip: Avoiding what scares you only makes it scare you more but, paradoxically, watching the movie might not help. If it's really causing you trouble, like PTSD-level shit, you might want to get some help. I don't mean that in a condescending way at all. It happens. We're just monkeys, really. Phobias can fuck with your self-esteem, and if it's bugging you that much maybe talking to someone about it would help. Not sleeping over it is not healthy."

I try to watch at least one horror movie a week and I can honestly say that no movies scare me anymore. Yes, there are a few movies that I come across now and then that make me feel a little unsettled. But everyone is different. And that's totally fine.

I just went to their site to sign up. I'm not sure if that's still for the beta or just for their mailing list.  What I want from a streaming service is for them to pick up a ton of the stuff that never quite made it from VHS to DVD/VOD. I know that's awfully niche, but it seems like a company like Shudder could get the streaming rights to those movies for pocket change. Pretty much only older geeks will care, but at the very least they can pad out their catalog and advertise ""thousands of movies!"".  I also want more definitive, uncut versions available from streaming services and through-the-mail disc rentals. All too often Netflix streaming or DVD will only have the rated cut. Spending $20 just to get a few extra minutes (sometimes seconds) of a movie sucks.  edit: forgot a word"

And that is the ability to watch on a TV with proper audio. All these services work via a web browser, which is fine if you don't care about quality, but for serious movie watching I believe it needs to be via a big TV, piped through a decent audio system and the ability to be controlled via a remote. As far as I'm aware, please correct me if I'm wrong, the only audio these services provide is stereo at most and being reliant on a web browser, you're at the mercy of glitchy playback under certain circumstances and the lack of ability to control it properly from the sofa, unless you have a full mouse and keyboard setup going on or some custom remote setup."

But I'm kind of confused as to why you did not wait until after 9 or even X to do this episode?  Are you planning on covering those?  What about Freddy vs. Jason?
horror,3b3bny,inconsistentseas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"Since we did Machetes after the core four -- and that ep gave us plenty to talk about -- it seemed natural to do another round of Machetes after the next four.   And... those films seem to be of a group, as well. They're the children of the mid-late '80s. After that, we push into the '90s, and the 2009 remake, which are more contemporary (relatively speaking), and have their own feel.   We actually just recorded our ep for GOES TO HELL this past weekend. John gets them online as soon as he's done with the edit. (We drink while we do these, so there are a lot of ummmmmmmmms and uuuuuuuhhhhhhs he trims out).   After that, it's X, FREDDY VS. JASON, and the 2009 remake. Then a final recap with (maybe) a guest speaker, during which we'll do our final round of Machetes."

Long story short, if you like Vampyros Lesbos, some of his other movies are worth seeing. They have a jazz-like looseness, lurid and vibrant visuals, and they tend to feature a lot of attractive women sans clothing. Coming out of a particularly un-groovy period in Spanish history, his movies are a rebellion against the church and fascists, so that's pretty cool. I'd say he's easier to appreciate as an exploitation director than a horror director. I liked his spins on Eyes Without a Face, The Bloody Judge, Venus in Furs, A Virgin Among the Living Dead, etc.  Oasis of the Zombies is regarded by some as one of the worst movies ever made, so there's that..."
horror,3b2mkl,robbyarcane,8,Thu Jun 25 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"Really, depends on what you want.  There's some decent recent stuff out there though.  I'm going through Netflix right now, so here's suggestions from instant watch:   Want some alien horror?  Might check out Extraterrestrial by the Vicious Brothers.  I myself liked it better than Alien Abduction, but that could be up your alley if you like alien stuff.   Want something more funny and campy?  Give Zombeavers a shot for some straight up, but solid, cheese.  Witching & Bitching is foreign, but a blast as well.   Werewolves?  Late Phases is a pretty solid werewolf flick.  Has a good cast too with Ethan Embry and Nick Damici.  Monsters?  Grabbers is solid.  A little campy too, but not as straight up camp as Zombeavers.  Troll Hunter is pretty fun for a foreign entry too!   Want some zombies?  Check out both of the Dead Snow flicks.  Those are a lot of fun!   Finally, you want something classic and down right scary? (Not on Netflix though) Look for The Changeling.  Make sure you get the George C. Scott version, not the Angelina Jolie one!"

horror,3b0l2a,Citizen_Kong,3,Thu Jun 25 06:12:43 2015 UTC,Maine as the back drop for Stephen King stories is a bit incongruous because Maine isn't that scary. As other people have mentioned movies have been shot in some towns and stories are based in some. Just don't look for Derry. It's not real.

horror,3b0l2a,hellokittycrackpipe,3,Thu Jun 25 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"There's a company that offers guided Stephen King tours to various Stephen King places of interest in and around Bangor, Maine. I've forgotten the name now, and there are other companies, some of which are like, a bus tour to King's house with a guide that reads from a script. I'd stay away from those. The guide was Stu, and I think he ran the company.   I thought it was going to be so and so, but it was surprisingly well done I thought. Very knowledgeable dude that was also maybe one of the most ravid Stephen King fans I've ever met. We visited atleast 25 places. His home, film locations, places he's worked, places featured in his stories etc. Visited the pet cemetary where King's kids and the neighourhood kids would bury their pets, the Barrens from IT, the airport from The Langoliers, the drain that inspired that scene from IT, and so on. No photo-ops outside the house though because King doesn't like it when  fans come right up to the fence."

horror,3b0l2a,sublimemongrel,12,Thu Jun 25 02:38:13 2015 UTC,Don't do that. King has stated several times publicly that people showing up outside his house is not appreciated. Put yourself in his shoes and let him have his privacy.
horror,3b0l2a,gemininature,3,Thu Jun 25 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think it would be ok if they kept their distance. Obviously they should not go up to the gate to get a photo of themselves in front of the house or try to actually enter the property, etc. But I think driving by or snapping a picture from a respectful distance is ok.  I mean, he's a household name, he lives on a road with public access and he put up a gate covered in bats and spiders. I think it's a little unreasonable to say that people shouldn't even look at his house."
horror,3b0l2a,mushpuppy,3,Thu Jun 25 04:10:53 2015 UTC,Oh bad suggestion then.
horror,3b42fx,BrockAtWork,3,Thu Jun 25 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"I really liked Lake Mungo because it took so many unanticipated turns and was effectively unsettling. The filmmakers definitely had the ending in mind since spoiler. I thought that was clever, and I liked the fact that they spoiler, which is kind of the whole theme of the movie."
horror,3b42fx,Trogpint,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"Unanticipated is cool if it makes sense in the context of the story. This movie reached (rather quickly), resolutions (non-resolutions) to like three separate sub plots that were not even related."
horror,3b22s5,BurnetRhoades,7,Thu Jun 25 10:02:28 2015 UTC,"LOL, my brother was the spider wrangler and coordinator on this film for the FX team.  I didn't visit his desk when I'd come by for lunch.    True story, they had a giant ""bird eater"" that they'd feed baby mice to.  Some of the softies at the company complained and got the practice stopped.  I think it might have gotten out of its tank too at one point.  I was glad I wasn't working there anymore."
horror,3b22s5,DoctorMystery,5,Thu Jun 25 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fun -- just a silly throwback, but definitely worth checking out, although the grammar cop in me hates the title's missing hyphen. Which is weird, because the earliest promotional material had it in there."

horror,3b22s5,KallistiGAD,2,Thu Jun 25 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"I saw Eight Legged Freaks almost directly after I watched Arachnophobia for the first time. All I remember thinking was ""meh"" and I don't even think I finished watching it all the way through because I was so bored with it. A while back I caught it on Netflix again and thought that maybe it just sucked the first time because it compares unfavorably with Arachnophobia (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and watching them too close together ruined the fun. Nope, still just ""meh"".   If you want a campy creature feature with spiders, skip this and pick up Arachnophobia."
horror,3b22s5,Khnagar,5,Thu Jun 25 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"It's a PG-13 horror-comedy that's not particularly scary nor funny, but perfectly okay'ish to watch.  I prefer the original B-movie creature feature of the fifties over this to be honest. Much because the giant CGI spiders are not charming or fun to look at, they're just bland and boring CGI that has, like most CGI effects, not aged well."
horror,3b22s5,horrorinpureform,2,Thu Jun 25 13:31:40 2015 UTC,I forgot about this movie until this thread cause...well...it's just forgettable. Not worth seeing.

horror,3b22s5,votedarky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"I've always loved this movie.  I was probably about 10 when I found the VHS tape at my uncles house, and decided to watch it secretly because I knew my parents wouldn't let me watch it. So every night I watched it in my room after my parents fell asleep. God knows I've seen the movie more times than it deserves, and I'm sure if I had not seen it when I was 10, it would probably be awful. But I guess its one of those movies that brings back nostalgia for me. Plus watching a guy get tazed in the nuts was the coolest thing to me"
horror,3b22s5,deadandmessedup,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"A quick, fun time. One of the nice touches is that the spiders sort of chirp and squawk and do little double takes. There's a Gremlins vibe to the film blending broad humor and mean-spirited violence (a lot of people die in this film ,albeit offscreen), and the flick doesn't overstay its welcome. The dirt bike and mall fights are highlights.  Weirdly, the only thing that really bugs me is how Scarjo's room is covered in aggressively lame posters of nu-metal bands."

horror,3b0916,EHendrix,9,Wed Jun 24 23:22:15 2015 UTC,"Someone suggested my movie to you on this page. The day it was released by YIFY it was stolen 100,000 times. In 1 day. We made $5 that day in real sales/rentals.  What kind of excuse is ""I don't have Netflix""?  If only there was some way to actually get Netflix!  If only there were a dozen ways to legally rent a movie for $3.99, the same price it cost to rent movies 20 years ago at Blockbuster, even though there has been quite a lot of inflation in that time.   I get it... Times can get tough... But I have no sympathy for anyone that steals my movie and also has a car, because my friend, the director hasn't been able to afford a car since the $600 car in the movie blew on set over 3 years ago. He takes the public bus to his job as a waiter. And HE finds a way to pay for movies.   So, when you sign with a winky face like that, it isn't funny. I haven't met a single horror filmmaker that isn't struggling to not just get ANY project off the ground, but struggling to feed their families.  Heck, our sound guy has worked with a ton of horror filmmakers and he was living out of his car when we filmed our movie. He said he is paid 1/3 what he was paid 10 years ago per job. Everyone is getting squeezed to accommodate pirates."

Here cinema releases have to coincide with DVD and Online releases so we get movies insanely late. I saw Gravity in the Czech Republic a good 9 weeks before it came to here.   Without the Bays I would've never been able to see things like Primer. I know that being indie movies it's technically worse, but it's better to see it like this than not see it at all.   You know how crappy B movies take up a good 60% of what's on YIFY? Well that's pretty much Danish Netflix right there."
horror,3b0916,startedbackin77,2,Thu Jun 25 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually don't know anything about YIFY, other than seeing my movie labeled with that and seeing one site say it had been downloaded 100,000 times with a day. I don't pirate movies, so I have to learn all this stuff to try to get a handle on it and adapt.   Releases overseas are annoyingly staggered, I know. That's the studios who fucked it up for indie people too. I'll be honest, I'm mostly concerned with piracy in the U.S.  It is where our movie is most easily available on every platform imaginable, yet 50% of the people on our torrents are from the U.S.    That said, we really fought to get the movie in as many countries as possible, with many of our DVD releases beating the U.S. DVD release date... That wasn't that hard to accomplish seeing as we could not get any U.S. Distributor to take our movie for disc due to the fact that it was already being pirated so freely.  In the end, we lucked the hell out and got released by Scream Factory.  Netflix is definitely the leader for consumers, but it is getting worse and worse as they simply turn themselves into HBO. They killed Blockbuster with the best DVD service ever, then killed their own rental service with streaming that is losing focus on movies. They've left a huge hole in movie distribution in my opinion, especially since they've pretty much killed the whole concept of renting by the movie. Kids growing up with Netflix will have never rented anything in their lives. I grew up renting all kinds of crap and I never felt outraged if I didn't like it. You kinda knew you were taking a BIG risk when you rented Carnosaur 2 or something. Simpler times!"

horror,3b0916,_hlidskjalf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:29:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!
horror,3b0916,Olypheus,2,Thu Jun 25 14:33:07 2015 UTC,"The Battery.   I was producer and cinematographer. I was also in charge of all post production which we did out of my house. I also mixed the sound and mixed the score. Then I did the color correction, design work, social media, 2 hours of special features for the disc, etc. Our core team is three guys. I do everything technical basically.   I also co-directed our second film, ""Tex Montana Will Survive!"" but we don't have the time off work to release that right now. We're hoping for November."
horror,3b0916,Pneumatic_Andy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"Pirate guy is an asshole. If it makes you feel better, I bought the streaming version of The Battery off the website (super easy to purchase BTW, kudos), and a DVD version for an office secret santa gift.  The way I see it, if I don't pay for the things I want, there won't be reason for artists to continue making these things. Plain and simple. Support the things you like or don't bitch when they go away."
horror,3b0916,_hlidskjalf,2,Fri Jun 26 02:59:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you sir... And exactly. I'm still bummed our $5 website release was a complete failure. It brings in $20 or so a month now. It basically pays for the hosting and domain names at this point. Made about $2000 all time on that, but I also spent 2 months making the website and preparing the release, not to mention the huge legal battle we fought to gain the rights to release without DRM from our other distributors. I really thought that was gonna be THE way to release a film, but we aren't Louis CK.   That's usually the most frustrating thing about releasing a film. How much work and money goes into releasing it. Forget making a movie, it isn't worth the time of releasing the movie to release a movie these days. I guess that's why we've had a second movie finished for over a year and still don't have a release plan.   Seriously though, thank you and I hope you watched the special features on the disc!  I wish discs weren't dying because I'm really happy with all that we put together for that release. It felt good to finally be DONE working on the movie once the disc was released. Secretly, there are minor color and sound fixes on the movie between when you probably bought it on the site and the disc as well (though the movie is up to date if you sign in and re download now). I was tweaking and making the movie better before every release, but the Scream disc is the final version. DONE. Thank god."

horror,3b0916,EndlessOcean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada so we don't get to have US Netflix. Sometimes, they will be released in the US but not in Canada ;) .. Since I saw most movies, the movies that I want to saw are relatively new/unknown so it's pretty hard to find on Internet (and even more in my local video store). Yes, I download movies, but I also own about 300 DVDs that I paid for the great movies.   Do you know how many bad horror movies there is out there? I will certainly NOT pay 4$ to rent a movie that I barely know about. If it's good, I'll be happy to buy it someday in store but not anybody can aford to rent every movies they see :S"
horror,3b0916,thatldopig,2,Thu Jun 25 13:39:16 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal... This is perfectly reasonable IF you pay after the fact to rent every movie you enjoy or comment on/review.  You can't pick or choose or think that because you buy some movies that it makes up for the others. I have the same DVD distributor as The Babadook, but buying Babadook doesn't help me in the least. What I mean is, if you watch 3 movies and enjoy them all, then buy the best one... You should still give a rental to the other two. It is absolutely better than a lot of people that you are buying movies at all, but you should always support content you enjoy. I have no problem with people stealing garbage, not even being able to finish watching, and not paying.    There are two other interesting things that have come out of piracy that few people think about.  One is the random person who downloads everything released by a group like YIFY... Then trashes the movies online. You can tell to a decent degree if a movie is your type of movie from a trailer. But the people that just throw out a huge net and download everything just because they can... They are often seen as not impacting rentals because they would've never rented the movie, even if they were rich. Here's the thing... These are the vocal assholes who trash a film online because it wasn't their type of movie. Some indie horror is very polarizing, but that's a good thing. Many people on this sub consider my movie to be one of the best of the last few years, but others consider it to be donkey shit I'm sure. Not every movie is meant to be enjoyed by every person. I'd rather claw my eyes out than watch a Fast and the Furious movie, but I get that they have a huge audience. Coincidentally, that audience will most likely hate my movie. When their wide net catches my movie for free and they accidentally watch a movie without blood and explosions... Their reviews a comments go on to hurt legitimate rentals by the type of person that will enjoy the movie. It's no coincidence that most of our bad reviews on Amazon are not ""verified purchases"". When someone goes on a rant bashing my movie on Twitter, I like to offer them a refund paid personally by me. I give them an email address and ask them to forward their receipt. Even though I'm broke, I can do this all the time because I know there is only a 1/50 chance they actually paid for the movie, because that is our ratio of piracy. I'm sure there have been paying customers who haven't liked our movie, I'm just saying that pirates are typically the ones that don't know anything about the movie or what kind of movie it is beforehand. And then they trash it and hurt my sales forever.  Pirates often say, ""would you rather I never watch your movie?""  In the case of certain types of people, yes. You aren't the audience it was made for.   The other thing about piracy is pretty self explanatory... It isn't really about the money in the indie horror world. At least not directly. I actually only own 5% of my movie because I gave away my ownership to people that worked for free alongside me. The money would be nice to see all these people who worked for months finally get paid, but real rentals and sales are more about the next movie. Without rentals there is no way to get the next movie made or distributed. The business people in this business only look at one thing... Numbers. If we can turn a profit on a small movie, we are more likely to retain control on the next movie... Or get a next movie made at all. Buzz only takes you so far, you must have numbers to back that up. Buzz without sales just brings out the producers who think that you need Paris Hilton as your lead actress to raise the sales. If you like what you've watched and you don't want to see their content watered down, you must support it.   For clarity, when I say ""my movie"" I am referring to my group's movie. I was not director, just producer, cinematographer, and in charge of all post production and the release. I co-directed our second film 18 months ago, but we haven't yet had the time off work to release it. I am looking into a way to release that film Creative Commons... So I am certainly not closed off... Just trying to make movies. You use up most of your savings and favors on the first one, so it only gets harder. ""Hey, I know you read about my last movie in Entertainment Weekly, but can you work for free?"" doesn't really work."
horror,3b0916,echocrest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Since I download them, I usually try to write a short review where I downloaded it so people know what they can expect of the movie. I totally agree about the people who just download anything and say that 'it's shit'... They wouldn't have bought the movie but I guess it hurts when people talk about your movie like this.  About your rentals, I totally agree, I would like to do so. But being a student and considering the amount of movies that I watch every week/month, it would cost a lot if I rented every movie that I like 4-5$ :P . Maybe someday I'll get Netflix or something similar but right now, best thing I could do is to review the movie. Maybe some other people will want to see this movie after that.  Sorry if the blink offended you, I didn't mean to. Good luck on your next project ! :)"

It was basically what that shitty Val Kilmer flick the Traveler should've been). Afflicted featured a charmingly Canadian vampire and was found footage, but a couple years old so you've prolly seen it by now. Oh, and the Poughkeepsie Tapes which is old but wasn't widely available til recently. I also remember Rabies or Rabid, an Israeli movie, being okay. In my YouTube queue is Haze, which again is not new but does take place in an enclosed space. Antiviral and Spring are good if you're in an artsy mood. I'm so jealous youve seen Creep! Was it another torrent or is there somewhere to rent or buy now? Have you seen Willow Creek? It's found footage that looks amusing."

Error #2: The Innkeepers was directed by Ti West (House of the Devil, Cabin Fever 2)... as you previously stated, Adam Green of Hatchet, Frozen did Digging Up the Marrow.   And as for Ray Wise's performance being 'unbelievable', I thought he had an amazingly genuine quality to him, and while knowing he was an actor immediately took me out of the faux-documentary zone, I still felt like he did such an excellent job of performing the character that I was enthralled the entire time.   Some of the encounters near the marrow were just so exciting in both a scary and fun way that horror seems to lack nowadays."

horror,3b0scr,Nizbel,2,Thu Jun 25 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is one of the best horror movies of the last few years. Some of the techniques it uses to create a creepy atmosphere are very subdued and effective, like the simple zoom in on the demon eyes on black background in the newspaper. I love that kind of stuff. The only downside for me are a couple of the really stupid jump scares (like the peephole), otherwise everything else is ace. Very sad movie about child abuse, and a similar idea to the Babadook where the mother's abuse is represented by a demon creature."
horror,3b0scr,horrorinpureform,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:10:09 2015 UTC,True.  This and The Babadook captured the creepiness of a dark past and presented it in a way that didn't feel over-troped or played out.

The story is nothing wowing and the horror elements are technically not unique.  But the approach was!  Because of this, I struggle to compare this to any other horror."

horror,3b2fzh,viken1976,6,Thu Jun 25 13:14:56 2015 UTC,I thought this movie was really boring and not scary at all to be honest. I didn't care about any of the characters and was honestly praying for them to all get killed off. I don't like supernatural horror movies very much though so that might have had something to do with it
horror,3b2fzh,christianhashbrown,3,Thu Jun 25 13:38:13 2015 UTC,I like the film because it was something different. Original horror films are rare and I dug the opening and earnest style. I forgive a lot when I see people are trying to do something different.
horror,3b2fzh,christianhashbrown,3,Thu Jun 25 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand that. Personally all I care about is how entertaining a movie is, and this one just didn't hold up for me"
horror,3b2fzh,christianhashbrown,4,Thu Jun 25 13:43:16 2015 UTC,I totally get how people wouldn't like it. I think M. Night's name as a producer skewed public opinion somewhat as well.

That dynamic destroyed what would otherwise have been a decent movie. Yeah, it was the devil but the characters have no real reason to believe that so why the hell is that detective even entertaining the notion?"

horror,3b2fzh,horrorinpureform,2,Thu Jun 25 23:27:06 2015 UTC,In this instance it just felt unnatural and forced. I can buy that a sadomasochist alien comes out of a portal opened by a puzzle box and takes you away to heaven/hell because the universe of the movie is built on that notion. Really nothing happened in the movie that would make that security guard sound even a little sane from the character's perspective.
horror,3b2fzh,drnyarlathotep,2,Fri Jun 26 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I personally don't consider watching a cast of 5 caricatures bickering in an elevator and experiencing awful plot twists to be very gem-like, but to each their own! Given how over-explored this subgenre is (small group of people trapped in confined space and have to work together), there are MANY better movies in it."

horror,3b2fzh,xxJrotheRxx,2,Thu Jun 25 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't see that as a twist. I saw it as the devil messing with the people. It would be a twist if the security guard was involved or it turned out the air was killing them. They messed up the names of two characters and that ended up hurting them. I guess what I meant was there was no ""earth shattering"" twist that comes out of left field."
horror,3b2fzh,dfd02186,2,Thu Jun 25 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"Twists work best when you don't see something coming that was shown to you being set up earlier.  They make you go back and see what was right in front of you.  It's like a magick trick that way.  When someone doesn't follow the rules and and just throws something in from left field that's called a deux ex machina (there's a specific subsection of the trope for this particular sort of narrative crutch, involving a character, but I'm too lazy to look it up now).    It's pretty much always a cheat and a sign that the storyteller couldn't figure out something good that worked and just went, ""fuck it.""  The ""surprise"" will then feel very unsatisfactory.  Using the supernatural as an excuse is just that, an excuse.  A storyteller/filmmaker isn't a genius or even smart for lying to the audience, they're clever for telling them something in a particular way, knowing the audience won't catch on, and then letting them have it later."

horror,3b0ujq,5celery,4,Thu Jun 25 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"The author is crazy.  Also, he seems to be right on many many points.  The movie is a mirror of the book, with Kubrick pretty much trolling King at every turn (their adverse relationship seems to have started when Kubrick refused to even read the treatment King was contracted to provide - granted, with the full knowledge that it could be rejected).  The argument for an absence of ghosts in the film is strong.  The wiki for the film is a good starting place - but the blog I linked you to goes much deeper.   I also appreciate both of them.  It's like a creative tennis match or something.  Big fan of the subject.  Wait until you get to the reverse playback of Jack's last words - - /r/creepy would shit themselves to death.    Also - enjoy the revelation that the hedge animals are in the film, and how friggin insane Kubrick was."

Jack as the devil (in tarot and otherwise), a ziguratt hidden in plain sight (along with other indian musings that play with King's ""hidden indians"" reference), the literal mirrors, the gollywog (and it's reasonable indication of racism), the deliberate visually disorienting incongruity all over the place, the theory about the moved chairs in many key scenes, the lion hero (mirror of lion threat) - it's all so good."

horror,3b0ujq,5celery,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:26:17 2015 UTC,What happens when you do this?
horror,3b0ujq,BristolEngland,2,Thu Jun 25 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"been looking for a link ever since I referenced it (found it to be surprisingly hard to find - a webpage specific word search eventually got me there) - - here it is  Accepting that Jack sold his soul, that he was lured out of the building (where he was presumably getting the benefits of the sale - either psychological, or literal), and that this scene is immediately followed by the portrait of him posed as the devil tarot card - - it becomes apparent who he's calling for help.  It also recalls Jesus calling for help on the cross - if you are particularly twisted.  The set-up to the link, from the blog:  What’s unusual about the final words Jack utters in, Stanley Kubrick’s “Shining”?   But there’s something else! Stanley Kubrick adds one more brilliant little touch at the end of “The Shining” that must be mentioned. You hear it every time you view the film but I bet you’ve never ‘really’ heard it. The final words spoken in the film; something borrowed from “The Exorcist” and we never would have known about it if a poster hadn’t mentioned this to me. Lightningscream suggested that I, “should watch the film in reverse. Kinda’ like reverse speech.” But even though some believe there are many hidden messages in rock & roll songs, could a message be hidden in a film the same way? I knew that there’s one obvious part of the film’s audio where Stanley Kubrick could have hidden something. People have come up with all sorts of explanations and translations of what Jack is saying at the end of the film. Some think he’s calling to the dead spirits in the Indian burial ground, or the “ghosts” in The Overlook, or a dead Saint, or maybe even the souls of the Donner Party. But after Jack sells his soul and takes Lloyd’s drink he’s been possessed by the purest of evil. Now it’s the big time. The Overlook was the place where all this happened and the scrapbook was the fuel for Jack’s insanity. But you have to listen closely to the 2 last words that Stanley Kubrick has Jack utter to truly understand the depth of what’s happened to him, and where he knows he’s going to be residing, “for ever, and ever, and ever”. It all sounds like gibberish unless you reverse the audio. Then it becomes frightening clear that Stanley Kubrick has hidden 2 of the most incredibly chilling words I’ve ever heard in a film. Hearing them has totally changed the end of the film for me. The anguish and despair cuts right through and the more you listen to it the more disturbing it becomes. Help Me! The final pathetic words spoken by Jack Torrance in “The Shining”, and Stanley Kubrick has him speak them in reverse. Heeelllppp Meeeee. A perfect chilling end to his film’s dialogue. Two words (like the word “Redrum”) brilliantly hidden and like his entire film, only understandable when reversed."

horror,3b0ujq,SweetPrism,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"I don't buy the theory about no ghosts but I like that dude's thoughts about jack writing the halloran scenes.  did you know that Kubrick called King in the middle of the night and asked him if he believed in God? true story.  what I believe is that The Shining movie is about the strong massacring and feeding on the weak, like the theory about the American Indians. what King's book seems to be about is alcoholism and redemption, don't think he ever got over Kubrick cutting the whole redemption thing.  But ghosts? in my mind really there."
horror,3b0ujq,SweetPrism,5,Fri Jun 26 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"I read the book and watched the movie. /u/SEX_METAL_BARBIE is right, in that they are separate entities. Now for the controversial part...  It's pretty well-known that King isn't a fan of the Kubrick interpretation. In this case, the movie is better and I side with Kubrick all the way. King's novel had a lot of cliches; the Shining was chock full of things the horror genre had never, ever seen before. It was so fucking dark. I could go on forever, but I probably won't say anything that hasn't already been said."
horror,3b0ujq,The_Toecutter,3,Thu Jun 25 02:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, before I watched it I learnt about how Kubrick didn't even bother reading King's screenplay. Ouch!   I agree with what you mean about the clichés (which aren't necessarily bad), and then how ground-breaking the film itself was. The way it was shot was very unsettling, coupled with the  perfectly matched soundtrack (which I have already said). I can imagine it was well ahead of its time.  Thank you for your contribution, you did spark some new thoughts for me."
horror,3b0ujq,SweetPrism,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"The not reading the screenplay thing is a Grade A douchebag move, for sure. It almost makes me wish I didn't think the movie was better."
horror,3b0ujq,The_Toecutter,2,Thu Jun 25 02:53:04 2015 UTC,i'll never slag the book - Kubrick wouldn't have picked it if it wasn't genius. but the movie's about one of the best ever made.
horror,3b0ujq,SweetPrism,2,Fri Jun 26 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yes! This is how I feel. I hope it didn't seem as though I ""slagged"" (?) it, haha. It's just that there were a few tropes in it that Kubrick did away with, and in doing so created a true horror masterpiece. An example of what I mean is Mrs. Torrance. He envisioned a blonde beauty queen who hadn't experienced much hardship in her life. Eh. It could've worked. But Kubrick, on the other end, presented the exact opposite; a wire-haired waif on the losing end of Lady Luck's allowance. There was a sadness that accompanied the actual horror aspect that I just didn't pick up as vividly from the book.   Also, the book goes into detail about the exploits of Harry Derwent and his ex-lover, Roger. I guess, what I'm trying to say, is there's a reason Wendy Torrance sees a guy in a dog suit blowing a man in a tux. But the beauty of the movie is this is never explained. That adds to the mystery, terror, and overall what-the-fuck-ness of the film version. Now, the back story is explained perfectly in the book (of course), but I liked that it was kept as a vague afterthought in the movie. The audience got to be as utterly confused and just, well, freaked out as Wendy when she was finally able to see all of the apparitions."
horror,3b0ujq,The_Toecutter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:51:01 2015 UTC,yeah all valid.  the book is just so masterful - he's never been great at writing women (unless you count describing their legs and breasts in fine detail) - but that's a small price to pay. the storytelling is so good it was like the genius daddy of a different kind of genius kid -  i just gotta look at em as whole different individuals.  and Kubrick's awesome movie wouldn't exist if King hadn't given him the right bones.  but I get ya!

(that film was a joke.)  they're separate beasts, in my mind, both great in their own ways. i'll have to give the novel another read to see how it scares me now... i read king's sequel about a year ago and found it extremely disappointing."

I'll keep spending my money on his shit because he's enthusiastic about horror and so am I.

I did think Clown was pretty good but I heard he really had minimal involvement in that movie's actual production. I happen to find most in the cannibal genre to be more style than substance and thus pretty unimpressive, so I'm not sure Roth's take on the matter interests me particularly. Ravenous would be a very notable exception, but yeah; its not directed by a ""horror"" director. Although I suppose the exceptions would be directors like Carpenter and Craven, as rare as they are."

horror,3aygxg,Zathras_listens,2,Thu Jun 25 12:25:48 2015 UTC,I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I remember thinking that beyond being gross there wasn't much to it. I felt the same about Hostel.
horror,3aygxg,DeseretRain,6,Wed Jun 24 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"I thought Cabin Fever was a great satire of the horror genre, still my favorite Eli Roth movie (the only thing he's done as good, imo, is the Thanksgiving trailer).  Hostel I didn't care for as much, but did find funny that he basically just ripped off the plot to Eurotrip and added horror to it, and not many people seemed to even notice."
horror,3aygxg,deviger,3,Thu Jun 25 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"I saw it the theater also, but on my first date with this girl and we made out probably half the time. It was great."
horror,3aygxg,DeseretRain,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:25:38 2015 UTC,Most people agree that Cabin Fever paved the way for movies like Cabin in the Woods. I think the problem is that people watch Cabin Fever and somehow don't get that it's satire.
horror,3aygxg,deviger,4,Thu Jun 25 01:10:55 2015 UTC,It can be satire and still not be good.

You can sit there in your living room watching any movie and come up with the perfect scenario of what you would have done because you are seeing the whole situation in the comfort of your home with time to think of your reaction. If, while you were concocting this post, a large dark shape burst through your window with a roaring power tool and started coming right for you; you would shit your pants and run face first into the wall.   And chainsaws aren't that heavy. Maybe you should hit the gym or something. But I'm a pretty big guy and I use them pretty regularly so maybe I'm just lucky there.  Also, you need a better fitting suit.   And you have poor balance.  And rednecks tan hides. I've done that too. Not a human one.  Those are my thoughts based on your post."
horror,3az6ft,Bomberhead,3,Wed Jun 24 17:57:28 2015 UTC,I saw this on Encore like ten years ago. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The scenes with the hearse driving by and overall tone of the film as it progressed legitimately gave me the creeps.

I enjoy Ray Wise anyway, and I've been on so many bicker-y car trips with my family through moderately creepy woods that I could identify with that dynamic. It had some delightfully weird moments, too. Not blowing any minds, but still a solid diversion."
horror,3az6ft,Jasonvoorhees2,2,Thu Jun 25 03:55:00 2015 UTC,I did really enjoy the dysfunctional family dynamic. It's easy to relate to for probably about anyone. The creepy woods drive was great too. It reminded me of when I lived in Tennessee and would drive through Nantahala forest to visit North Carolina.
horror,3azfot,holdincallfeeld,11,Wed Jun 24 19:04:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is any inherently superior way to deal with it.  If its done poorly, it'll be crappy either way. Have to take it on a case-by-case basis. I.e. Aliens vs Resurrection"
horror,3azfot,IDGAF1203,2,Wed Jun 24 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think both can be done really well. I love series like Phantasm where you grow to become really engaged with the surviving characters, and each ""episode"" adds to the development. On the other extreme, I also love anthology horror, where usually you have different stories with different characters within just one movie, so movies that take a different cast/direction per sequel are good too.  Both can be done well, both can be done badly. Some series take a continuation approach and mess it up by being inconsistent or suffering from the ""Highlander Curse"" (where each sequel continually vies to be the de facto Highlander 2, ignoring the predecessor sequels). Some take the different cast approach but mess up by either copying the previous cast too closely (drawing unfavourable comparisons) or departing so much in direction and vibe that it becomes an in-name-only sequel."
horror,3azfot,alphahydra,2,Wed Jun 24 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"As long as the sequel is good I guess I don't really mind how they pick it up, but I do love it when the sequel starts at the moment the first movie ends like Halloween and Phantasm."
horror,3azfot,PhilipkWeiner,2,Thu Jun 25 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"I think both approaches can work, but I personally prefer continuations."
horror,3azfot,comichorrorweirdo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"I prefer case by case because horror movies have the burden of not revealing too much to stay scary. Look at Insidious, where everyone has plenty good to say about it until the second half where the demon is revealed and it ruins the mood. I think the same goes for movies as a whole, because a sequel has to walk the very thin line of revealing enough to keep the story interesting, but not enough to ruin what is better off left to the imagination."
horror,3azfot,I_Am_Not_Me_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:06:41 2015 UTC,"I think it depends for me?   On the one hand, watching a character grapple with the issues from the previous film. Their psychological struggles certainly make for good viewing.  On the other hand, new people getting murdered in familiar ways is kind of comforting. Like, ""Ah yes. Hello new victims. Wonder how you'll go."" It's one of the reasons I'm so obsessed with Wrong Turn and Cabin Fever."
horror,3azfot,Aristophan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"I find that each one being its own story works best, then again I'm a huge fan of reading short horror stories as I think this is the best way to present them. It keeps the story focused on the horror, not drama or family dynamics or character development (not saying that these can't be incorporated well, it's just more often than not they seem to get in the way of the horror elements), then again that's just how I prefer my horror."
horror,3azfot,CrypticMonk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"It definitely depends on the franchise, the 'Saw' series managed to build upon itself on each sequel in a brilliant manner, but (unfortunately) the intricate tie-in was the only good part in several of the 'meh' sequels. 'Halloween' sequels also have a slightly weird timeline, some of them are tied in, some of them are not, some of them are good, some of them are not, 'Friday the 13th' sequels have played with it a bit (Tommy Jarvis) but are usually only good if they are set at Crystal Lake. IMO it depends on the antagonist, sometimes a back-story and continuous narrative can work, but mystery and ambiguity can be very effective in horror, and subsequent tie-in sequels usually have to sacrifice these techniques."
horror,3azfot,NecronomiconExMortis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"The key to a good sequel is that it be as fully fleshed out as the original.  The reason so many sequels fall flat is that the original creator often spends years dreaming of and perfecting a great story, great characters, great settings and great plot devices.  The order for a sequel comes along and there are maybe 18 to 24 months to complete the creative vision for the new  film.  Sometimes, the setting or theme is reusable but the best way to tell another story is with all new people.  Sometimes the original story is ""big enough"" that there are other ways to explore the same setting.  The classic example of this is Godfather II.  Aliens comes pretty close, but spins the whole genre from a creepy thriller to a tense action story.  I think it also helps to explain why third movies are so often better than seconds (Final destination, Paranormal Activity).   They want to build a franchise, and know that the cheap cash-grab of the 2nd film won't work a third time."

horror,3axgol,cabbage16,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:04:50 2015 UTC,I like the idea of the movie.  I think it'd be much better without seeing anything but I guess we shouldn't judge it too much until we see it.

horror,3axq4y,DiscoDev,14,Wed Jun 24 10:02:30 2015 UTC,"This is my all-time favorite zombie movie.  Aside from the iconic scenes it holds a special place in my heart because it gives a shoutout to my hometown.    Everything about it is great.  The unsettling chaos of the opening scene sets the stage perfectly for all that is about to ensue.  The outbreak is in full bloom, and the news station people are absolutely losing their minds.  And the mall scenes are terrific.  The fun the characters have amidst all the mall mayhem makes for some great moments of dark humor.    I could go on and on about this one.  It's not just one of my top 3 horror movies, it's one of my favorite movies."
horror,3axq4y,sigersen,14,Wed Jun 24 15:25:11 2015 UTC,I love this as much if not more than Night of the Living Dead. It's so watchable. The remake pales in comparison.
horror,3axq4y,KingKyuss,4,Wed Jun 24 12:41:12 2015 UTC,What's there to say that hasn't been said? This is the quintessential zombie flick. A social commentary on the developing consumerism of America in the late 70's or just a clever writer/director wanting to make a badass movie. It's good. You know it's good.
horror,3axq4y,DJBenz,5,Wed Jun 24 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"I remember when I first watched this at about age 12, thinking how cool it was because the zombie outbreak was there from the start. I wasn't aware that Night of the Living Dead preceded it and set up the outbreak story. Other zombie films at the time (mainly the Italian rip-offs) all seemed to work on the principle of an hour's exposition and filler before 'the rising' scene - which was always cool in itself - and a load of zombie carnage in the last 20 minutes. As a kid I couldn't be doing with the wait, so Dawn provided exactly what I needed: zombies from the outset.  Weird how almost all zombie films these days start with the apocalypse already underway. I miss the old hand/face coming out of the earth sequences of days gone by."
horror,3axq4y,Spacejack_,6,Wed Jun 24 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Numerically speaking (number of viewings) this is easily my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it any day of the week and love the shit out of it.  My favorite aspect of the entire film (and I do love the ENTIRE film) is the ending... ""We're fucked. 'Kay, let's go."" Sums up the entirety of life there in about ten seconds.  I deeply love the entire pre-Hollywood Romero canon (okay, you can keep Vanilla and Jack's Wife), but DAWN... man, DAWN is something seriously special. Although I occasionally drift into thinking that KNIGHTRIDERS is actually a better movie, DAWN will always be my favorite and Romero my favorite American independent filmmaker. NIGHT, CRAZIES, MARTIN, DAWN, KNIGHTRIDERS, and DAY (honorable mention for MONKEY and yes I am intentionally leaving out CREEPSHOW, which I do like but isn't in the same league)... Yeah, I appreciate Cassavetes and Lupino, but give me Romero any day of the damn week."

horror,3axq4y,robscomputer,3,Wed Jun 24 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"The zombie genre is my favorite, and have seen many movies from the classic slow zombies to the 100 yard dash zombies of today. But out of all the movies, Dawn of the Dead is still my favorite. I think what makes this movie my favorite is the slow burn of the pace. If you watch this movie, you almost feel on edge, some of the scenes drag on but I think it was written this way to make you feel ""trapped"" in the mall with the cast. Most zombie movies never give you the sense of dread, where you know you're trapped and the fear is always out there, even if you enjoy the interior prison.   Overall, I would say this movie is done extremely well, you run through so many emotions, from panic, to fear, then happiness, followed by sadness and dread. Wish more zombie movies went this route rather than shock scares."

If that's the movie you're referring to, I'm gonna have to disagree; I came here to r/horror to rave about it. I loved, loved, loved this movie. It's my favorite since Yellow Brick Road; if you saw that and liked it, you'll like Creep. Very subtle, very unnerving, and best of all very believable."
horror,3b0nnu,TheLaramieReject,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:10:20 2015 UTC,What made you like it so much ?
horror,3b0nnu,TheLaramieReject,6,Thu Jun 25 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"Well, first off it was really believable. You could feel the tension between the protagonist's desire to be polite and kind vs. his gut sense that something wasn't right. Then there was the bad guy: he was so much like so many actual creeps that I've met. Manic, boundary issues, a real desire to be liked. From the beginning you can tell that he's not on the up-and-up, but the movie keeps you guessing until the very end as to whether or not he's actually dangerous, vs. just disturbed. These are pitfalls that we all have to navigate all the time. I don't think there's any one of us who hasn't kept up a conversation with a freaky person for a little longer than we should have, just because we didn't want to be rude.  The movie relied on tension. The long, quiet scenes when your mind is screaming that something's not right really got to me. And there was a strong psychological element; through the whole movie I, a woman, kept thinking ""there's no way that a girl would still be in this situation."" It was the protagonist's masculinity that put him in danger. The whole time he just brushes everything off. He breaks rules that women have had drilled into them for forever: don't go to the house of a man you don't know, don't walk into the woods with a creepy guy, don't accept drinks from a creepy guy, don't meet a dangerous man alone, and most importantly, leave as soon as things don't feel right. But the character is much too manly to ever really, really see the danger he's in. Of course this is just my perspective as a female.  Personally, I really enjoy horror movies that don't just show you a scary monster straight from the get-go. I like to feel the characters' self-doubt and confusion as they try to determine what exactly is happening to them. This movie kept up that suspense all the way through. So many other horror movies rely on jump-scares, special effects and costumes. That's a cheap way to go, in my opinion. This one relied on our own instincts to make us feel fear."

horror,3b0nnu,illferrell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"Spoilers to follow:   I liked this film. I'm a horror lover but I don't watch every single horror flick out there because I'm kind of picky about them. I do enjoy low budget films with interesting stories though, something I haven't seen done a bajillion times before. For me this describes Creep. I also like a little humor in horror films, which this also had although in that uncomfortable, is this guy for real? Way. I think we all know someone who is just slightly off and makes you feel uncomfortable although on the surface he seems harmless.   I also work in mental health and the killer was playing a very extreme mix of someone with borderline PD and antisocial PD. Again, a very extreme dramaticized version that is super rare in real life. But nevertheless he has those traits so it was interesting for me to see his progression as you realized just how batshit crazy he is.   If there was anything I didn't like about the film it was how the protagonist stayed so calm throughout. The killer kind of sums up why he thinks this is and I agree but it seems like any normal person would have noped the fuck out of there waaaaay before the final video was delivered."
horror,3b0nnu,dfd02186,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:07:15 2015 UTC,yeah the mental health aspect of the killers personality definitely bordered on comical at certain times which made it all the more terrifying when it was brought down a little. I agree with the idea they didn't establish enough of a fascination with the subject on part of the videographer. it seemed ridiculous he would continue to indulge him.

Even then nothing made me actually jump or go aw shit. Their were a few jump scares but nothing unexpected or unusual. Was just the usual, come around a corner and he's there or pan left and turn right he's there.  The penultimate scene with him axing the guy in the head was so obvious from the start when within the first 10 mins he zoomed on the axe, that was going to be the murder weapon.  When the final scene came up with the closet of video tapes ... I mean come on. How cliche. Serial killer trophy case, how original. Also their were a lot of points where if the camera man had any common sense ( i know its not a real guy and i get that it is just a film for entertainment ) but why didn't he just go to the police after him turning up at the door ? If he had that many people killed in that rented house someone is going to pick up on it. I know its just a film but honestly was just probably due to hype why I disliked it so much, nothing new that made me go, 'I need to tell everyone about this'."

That's all i meant, but yeah, I agree with your classification of Re-Animator as sci-fi horror, just to a lesser degree than a movie like, say, Alien, which is a blatantly sci-fi horror."

I was obsessed with this series when it aired. It hit me at the perfect age where I had disposable income and no responsibilities. I eagerly bought every DVD of every episode as they were released. I don't think there has ever been a better set of extra features. You'd get a making of doc that was usually great and a doc on the career of the director, which was also very good.  Not every episode was great, but I believe many were, and I love that there was a format available to release hour-long horror movies. Most of my favorites were in season one, and were ways to discover two of my favorite directors - Carpenter and Stuart Gordon. Dreams in the Witch House led me to Re-Animator and From Beyond, for which I'm eternally grateful for the series as a whole.  Just two days ago I ordered the boxset for Fear Itself of Amazon for ten bucks. I've only ever seen a single episode, and my expectations are low, but I'm just looking for some fun, short horror movies, so they should serve that purpose at least."

It hasn't really worked apart from a small number of exceptions.  I love Michael, Jason, Chucky, Leatherface and Freddy as much as the next person, but the fact that Hollywood is doing MORE remakes/reimaginings/reboots/re-whatever of these guys is not giving the slasher sub-genre a breath of new life of anything, or horror in general for that matter, it's just playing on old formulas and characters that are guaranteed moneymakers to try and make more money.  If 2016 wants to be the year of the slasher movie comeback, there need to be filmmakers out there who not only have the influence and financial backing to make a film of this level production-wise, but ALSO need to have the passion and creative juice to create something is original and fresh, and bring something new to the table.  At least, that's my opinion. I'm an aspiring filmmaker, so I'm biased toward original content, but that's what I think needs to happen.

Then I Know What You Did Last Summer also did tremendously well, and slashers came back in style for a while. Those films became franchises, and slashers can't become much more successful than being turned into long running franchises. A lot of other films followed, cashing in on the popularity of those films.

Hell, white trash hillbilly killer family wasn't at all original here but it was the way RZ's cast played otherwise over-the-top material in a grounded, gritty way with a sense of conviction that sold his film.  It was a cartoon but it didn't look or feel tongue-n-cheek.  It's the wink at the audience that kills a lot of horror movies, slasher or otherwise.

Overall though, I totally agree, stop with the reboots, remakes and sequels.    There's no reason to spend a lot of money on horror, no reason to put expensive name actors in horror (most horror), so no reason to be so terribly fearful of having to give an audience something they've already enjoyed rather than risk bad B.O. on an original idea.  There's loads of books out there that could be adapted if you don't already have an original horror script you wanna make.  Fantastic style there in Maniac though and going in a direction nobody had gone before with this sort of material.  Just gorgeous, and horrific.  Here was a film that deserved its R.    I'm working on a Russian film that's done in this way, POV, that's more of a scifi-action picture but it's got a lot of horror as well.

horror,3avskl,ZombieDib,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:06:53 2015 UTC,"The problems are somewhat the same as what brought the genre down in the eighties: Censorship, audience fatigue and too little creativity.   In the eighties censorship meant slashers kept getting cut and became more bloodless and boring as the video violence issue and please-think-of-the-children politics came into play. Today it means PG-13 slashers, which are an abomination.   Audience fatigue is not really an issue today, the market is not flooded with slashers anymore. (It's flooded with zombies though.) There aren't really a lot of slashers being made, there are no runaway slasher hits at the cinemas, and not a lot of productions to cash in on the success of those slashers. The last time that happened was when Scream and And I Know What You Did Last Summer became giant hits.  Too little creativity should not be an issue today, and yet it is. And when I say creativity it's a lot about the creativity of the kill, the gore and the special effects. Slashers are fairly un-original, they've always been a genre that's stuck to a formula, and there is nothing wrong with that. What sets them apart and what fans love are some good, gruesome kills spaced out at regular intervals throughout the film. Also need a good, scary killer, a decent backstory and locations, and hopefully the cast can act a bit as well. But that's all really, nothing more is needed.   Slashers and horror/action in general being PG-13 means that the whole creative aspect of the kills and the gore is gone, neutering most slashers and rendering them sub-par before they even hit the screen. A slasher should be rated R, but that doesn't happen too often anymore. Hollywood is also loathe to take on anything new and creative, and all the CGI effects for the gore doesn't help either."

But what about all the great new horror films being made. Say what you will about these movies but You're Next, It Follows, The Babadook are great for the genre and people are trying new things. Maybe the best thing for the genre is to move away from the icons."

horror,3avskl,ToxicBronson,3,Wed Jun 24 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I do like this idea and I'm getting a little excited for these films to come out, I've always loved these characters. I see what others are saying about originality and I get the point, but seriously, I'm always going to be excited to see different takes on the classic monsters' stories we've always liked, even if they're good or bad movies, to see what new ages of cinema and technology can bring to old classics.   It's too late and I don't know if I am getting my point clear, yes, constant reboots or remakes or restarts make the whole franchise more confusing and probably lessens the psychological value of these films, but I could keep watching new Jason or Myers or Leatherface movies for as long as they keep making them.. so yay new old slashers!"
horror,3avskl,BurnetRhoades,2,Wed Jun 24 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"Movies like Human Centipede and Tusk aren't really slasher movies per se, but I think they represent where the evolution of horror has pretty much gone in recent years.   First there was the intense gross out feel-the-pain type movies like Saw and Hostel and then when watching people get tortured started to get old things went even further in horror and we got these films that were pretty much just about trying to make us puke/disgust/revolt us.  I personally hope that the trends in horror don't really continue on this way. These films were good but trends are stupid and I'm waiting for what's next.  I have a feeling Matt Parker and Trey Stone could really blow the minds of horror fans if they were to put their hearts into it (Cannibal the Musical, anyone?). And I like to think/hope that Rob Zombie still has another good movie in him. But most of my hope is with the guy sitting in his mom's basement right now who is soon to be the ""next big thing""."

We don't necessarily need more ""slasher"" flicks, but if a movie is based on a creative idea and/or offers new tweaks on the standard model and it also happens to have a slasher in it then I will still want to see it.   A slasher movie really could be so many things. It could practically go with any other (sub)genre you could think of with entertaining results...I am thinking a Western Slasher...A dance movie (like Step Up) with a slasher)...A dramatic period piece (Downton Abbey-style) with a slasher...A kids movie about a goofy bunch of slashers that travels around slashing?? A sports movie about a team of down-on-their-luck slashers that are fighting to win an unexpected championship in the serial slashing world?? A movie Like The Fast and The Furious...but with slashers driving.   You get the idea.   These are post-modern times. Cramming together things that normally seem unrelated via art is kind of like as real of a manifestation of our consciousness as we can truly get.

Some are just gas clouds or weird noises or things like that.  SCP sends out operatives to investigate rumors of strange goings ons, usually finding one of these things in the process and trying to imprison it for the safety of mankind.  Most of these things have weird habits or a veritable checklist of safety precautions designed to prevent them from doing whatever it is they do (If they melt through walls, there will be a big description about the container it is kept in to prevent that from happening""  It touches on a lot of horror tropes such as animated dolls, things that go bump in the night, etc.  Now then, my personal favorite SCPs are ones that touch on real life creatures/mascots and can be pretty funny.  Here's a good one. Give it a read and see if you can figure out what manner of creature they have contained. . .

horror,3avbh7,classicalhumanbeing,2,Wed Jul 15 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"It came out on iTunes last night and subsequently leaked to every torrent site so I'd say its more than ""released to media outlets"" right now.   I saw it just now and I enjoyed it. Not as good as many people are making it out to be but it's still a solid movie. I was expecting it to be crazier than it turned out to be but overall I thought it was well-executed and compelling. Definitely worth a look, especially if you like dark humor and suspense."

horror,3avbh7,yezplz,0,Wed Jun 24 03:57:52 2015 UTC,"I just watched it last night but I didn't really end up enjoying it. I thought that the concept was great and the movie could be a hit had they gone another direction, but it just suffered in a few areas that I think will hurt it from catching on.   The biggest issue for me was a combination of the build up being way to slow with a predictable/anti-climatic ending. A lot of time is spent on dialogue trying to paint ( and I mean a lot) Josef's character. The producer make the conversations overly deep but it really just ends coming off as r/iamverysmart sorts of dialogue. No content and just a lot of fluff. There are many attempts to make Josef creepy with on screen acting for sure, but it just felt like they tried to many simple ways without hitting the mark on any one scene. It was classic stalker/weirdo stuff but it was just poorly done in terms of timing, dialogue, etc.  The main character's response to all this makes the movie a thriller but not really because he goes from being scared to annoyed to angry to scared again to sympathetic.  There's no real sense of fear here as a viewer. The movie was essentially all jump scares, which are literally a character jumping in front of the camera for no particular reason. There were a few scenes where there was potential do something scarier, but it just did't deliver. After the second to last scene, I found myself saying ""okay now what?""   I guess the best way I can put how I felt is, it came off to me that they tried to hard to make the movie deep and unique in the thriller/found footage genre by simplifying what actually happened (in terms of # characters, locations, scares, etc). Really though it just came off as a boring final product that didn't really ever satisfy my desire for creepiness, horror, or thrillers. Had they gone VHS or Sinister style with multiple situations in one movie focusing on how Josef has changed what he has done, I think it would have been better."
horror,3avbh7,LuigiVanPeebles,3,Wed Jun 24 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"I have a rebuttal, but not necessarily a disagreement. I saw this movie back in 2013 before it had any kind of marketing attached, and have lately been expressing the unpopular opinion that it is not a horror movie for many of the same reasons you say. I think for something to be considered horror, you need characters that are scared, but there is very little of that in this movie.   It's actually just an interesting little indie movie about manipulation, and breaking down people's boundaries. All of the dialogue scenes that you found boring are slow escalations of how those boundaries get broken down through persistent escalation. Duplass' character is constantly seeing how far he can push forward, and then pulling back. Then he pushes again.  My fear has been that seeing this marketed as a horror movie people are only going to be watching it based on a preconceived set of expectations, or looking for the scares when there really aren't any in the movie. That director's second film is coming out in theaters this Friday. It's also about manipulation and breaking down boundaries, only this one uses swingers."
horror,3avbh7,dunctron603,0,Wed Jun 24 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more, Dindle. They went way overboard trying to make Duplass intimidating and it just didn't work. The part where the screen is black and he's talking about his wife? Went on for so long and it was like Duplass was doing one of those long set-up jokes. Just not the role for him. Plus the main dude was like a foot taller than him, didn't seem like a problem. I thought the movie really suffered because of this. Not the right role for Duplass.  Wanna see some awesome Duplass check out The One I Love, he's great in that movie and it's creepier in a much more subtle way."

In fact, I dislike when a horror film opens up with a pointless opening kill just to advertise the fact that it is, indeed, a horror movie. Not only does it often spoil the killer's mystique, it's usually totally predictable what's going to happen.  However, even some of the best slow-burns start out creepy; look at the opening of The Innocents, with the melancholy child singing in the background, which cuts to the distraught voice of the nanny, hands up in prayer, stating how she regrets ""destroying"" the children. Chills. And yet not overt about where the film's fright factor will come from."
horror,3awnfp,gooch2k2,2,Wed Jun 24 05:44:14 2015 UTC,Funny you mention the Innocents. I literally watched the opening last night.  Reminded me in a similar way of Night of the Hunter and The Other.

The humor of the first 30 minutes in the first movie kind of eased you in, made you comfortable - it made it so once the creepy shit started, it was really creepy. The second movie was too serious for its own good. That being said, I do like the part where they ""escape"" and end up back at the asylum after the elevator goes down."

That second season finale took some incredible balls to go through with, and I loved it. I would not be surprised to see this picked up on cable if the stars/creator want to continue the series"
horror,3ara5i,TheGamerGeek,19,Mon Jun 22 22:01:40 2015 UTC,It's kind of a miracle that it's lasted as long as it has.
horror,3ara5i,InkFings,14,Mon Jun 22 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"No kidding, especially when you take into consideration creator Bryan Fuller's track record with tv shows. That guy creates some amazing shows, but they never last beyond their second season.   Wonderfalls was cancelled after one season.   Dead Like Me was cancelled after two seasons (don't mention that atrocious movie they made).  Pushing Daisies was cancelled after two seasons.   All amazing shows, but they never get a chance to really shine."

Dead Like Me made it to 2 seasons, but Bryan Fuller was fired from it pretty quickly. I forgot what point he was canned, but the show really noticeably dropped in quality within 1 or 2 episodes then never recovered. Uh, the movie.   Probably the worst was Mockingbird Lane which at least we got to see the pilot."

Hell, I have cable, and I could catch it when it airs live, but I still watch it by other means because the commercials draw you out of the show.   If you're watching a normal bullshit show, fine, the commercials suck, but they don't interfere as much. If you're watching Hannibal about to kill someone, or Will going into a crazy psychotic episode and suddenly ""Billy Mays here for OXYCLEAN"" pops up, you just killed the mood.  This show was made for Netflix."

horror,3ara5i,BurnetRhoades,5,Tue Jun 23 05:37:31 2015 UTC,People don't get it.  I would imagine the average NBC viewer's head must have exploded by now with how they're purposely indulging in imagery instead of filling the void with blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
horror,3ara5i,Karmakerosene,10,Tue Jun 23 15:18:07 2015 UTC,"With how over-the-top artistic and lyrical they're going with the imagery this season it doesn't surprise me.  It's almost like Fuller was daring them to cancel it.    I'm glad it lasted up to Graham taking on Dolarhyde.  This is what I've been waiting for since the end of S1Ep1 with my jaw on the floor.  If no other network picks it up I'll have gotten more than I expected.    I wonder if not being able to get the rights to Clarice Starling had anything to do with cutting their losses before having to figure out how to handle The Silence of the Lambs season.  What's in a name, but I could see this being a really difficult thing to get passed.  On top of that, once Red Dragon is done there's little reason to keep Graham in the picture unless they go completely off-book and then reconciling that with TSotL would be...extra messy."
horror,3ara5i,VoyagerVideo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was it. They wanted to continue the show and had plans to whether they got the rights or not. The way that they've been taking creative control over the the series, it could certainly still work."
horror,3ara5i,stainslemountaintops,2,Tue Jun 23 08:43:16 2015 UTC,"It's terrible news but at least they will be able to give the show a proper ending - this season will go through Red Dragon and complete Will Graham's story arc anyway.  Also if another network or streaming service picked it up, ""Silence of the Lambs"" would be a much cheaper season to produce."
horror,3ara5i,MyUserNameTaken,2,Tue Jun 23 13:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised that they let the show continue for three seasons, given that the ratings were quite bad..."
horror,3ara5i,rocket_psyence,2,Tue Jun 23 14:05:33 2015 UTC,It received great critical acclaim.  It also was much more popular in europe than it has been in the US.  Those two facts allowed them to keep it on the air.

horror,3ara5i,svperstarr,-3,Tue Jun 23 21:16:21 2015 UTC,Will get downvoted but so what. Hannibal is a poorly written illogical show and requires you to not just suspend disbelief but pretend the whole thing is a massive dream sequence if you want the show to make anything even resembling sense. I have been watching it because I like the character of Hannibal but it is not in any way good.

horror,3apvdg,wwwomp,16,Mon Jun 22 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Clive Barker's Books of Blood (Vol. 1-3) is a great collection of his short stories. There are some truly bizarre and horrific tales. Clive Barker doesn't hold back in some of these and there is no ""boundry"" he wont cross.  My favorite short story of his is Rawhead Rex and involves an ancient, hyper-sexualized monster wreaking havoc in a small, rural Irish town and is fond of eating children (in unflinching description).  The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson might get me some flack on here since this ""true story of non-fiction"" from the 70's is now generally regarded as being entirely made up. Still though, the book is immensely more creepy than the sleepy 70's movie version. Family members being frozen in place seeing a ghostly hooded demon wander about the halls and the young daughter's interactions with a demonic pig used to keep me up at night..."
horror,3apvdg,dsc89,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"I just stumbled on this and am about 50 pages away from completion of The Amityville Horror. I actually find it laughable at points. Not saying you shouldn't have been scared or anything as there are certainly creepy parts. Maybe it is the way it's written? So many exclamation points for 3rd person ""non-fiction"". I feel it really detracts from what should still be a creepy story and makes it seem like something to be told around a camp fire. That being said I am enjoying the book for what it is. I think it is definitely worth a read, even if just to see how ineffective jump scares are when in the written form. Oh and to your previous recommendation, Books of Blood is one of my favorite collections."

Enjoy this classic.  I also recommend the original Dracula. It's short, and some of the scenes are so absolutely memorable, I remember being very impressed. In the context of it's time (the period right before what we would consider the very beginning of forensic science), it's a very interesting take on modernity.  Edit: And what am I talking about, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. A body-terror fantasy written by a sixteen year old poet high on opium who had terrible nightmares. Keeping that in mind makes this book hella disconcerting."

horror,3apvdg,ghoulishgirl,7,Mon Jun 22 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"This is one of my absolute favorite books ever, but I really got fed up with the tattoo artist's narrative.  I found his constant intrusions annoying, but the account of the house was so compelling, it kept me from putting the book down.  Pretty soon, I started skipping him entirely, and just reading Navidson record only.  Anything in courier, I just skipped.  Footnotes?  I glanced at them only, and if they didn't seem interesting, I skipped those too.  Probably not the best way to read this book, but it was the only way I managed to make it through, and the Navidson record is SO WORTH IT."

I'm sure i was supposed to care about his slow descent into madness, but frankly going mad was the most interesting thing that ever happened to him.  I wish I'd had the confidence to skip his sections, I was just too worried about missing something important."
horror,3apvdg,autophobe2e,4,Mon Jun 22 20:29:36 2015 UTC,"I will always say that book would be 200x better if it was JUST the navidson record bits, and the tattoo artist wrapper which amounted to a bunch of literary fluff from the author was just gutted. As it stands I can't agree with the high praise the book gets, because so much of it was just a literary self wank, and a distraction from the story you actually care about."

horror,3apvdg,The_Dead_See,2,Tue Jun 23 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"""1408"" by Stephen King: This is a short story found in his anthology collection entitled Everything's Eventual and then later adapted to the big screen in a film starring John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson. It involves an author of cheap tourism literature who visits haunted houses and hotels just to write top ten list paperbacks. However when he attempts to visit the Dolphin Hotel in New York City he finds that unlike all his previous hotel visits, the manager of the Dolphin refuses to let him stay in the notorious room 1408. Half the story consists of the manager explaining why, and that's some of the best stuff. The movie meets that rare qualification of actually being better than the book, but be sure you get the DVD version since the BluRay and Digital Download versions have the alternate ending and deleted scenes which totally change the story.  ""Phantoms"" by Dean Koontz: Whatever you do, please do not watch the movie. If you've already seen it then please don't discount the book because of the movie. The book is very good and although it fits primarily into the horror/sci-fi sub-genre, it's got two of the scariest moments in horror literature I've ever read.  ""14"" by Peter Clines: One of the best modern day Lovecraftian horror/sci-fi novels I've ever read. It pains me that there is no sequel to this book."

But they won't be alone. For something there, something they don't like to think about, is thinking about them...and about all the ways to make them die."

horror,3apvdg,robsalem,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Ugh.... To me this one was disgustingly horrific, like Hostel.  I am not scared by this sort of stuff, just grossed out.  I like the stuff that revolves more around the psychological, the supernatural, or the unknown.  This is one by King and Hill that I can honestly say I didn't like at all, but I can't say it wasn't well written.  Just not my type of horror."
horror,3apvdg,jwgarcia82,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if we read the same book, then? Because for me, In The Tall Grass was exactly that--pyschological/supernatural/unknown horror. That lingering, creeping horror that gnaws at you in the late evening. I got a definite sense of Blackwood and Lovecraft out of this one. Which is pretty much exactly why I liked it."

Instead, I will add three authers that are amazing and you can get for 99¢ on Amazon: Thomas Ligotti, Saki, and William Hope Hodgeson. They are mostly novella and short story, but lights on scary is their bread and butter. Saki tends to irony and surprising ending that break your heart...or your nerves. Good Stuff.  I have read everything suggested. Some, like house of leaves is not for kindles.

His Infected trilogy has some intense imagery and the third book, Pandemic, finishes with 200 pages of some of the best of action and horror I've read. It's one giant intense scene that you must experience.  Also, if you're the type of person that likes to listen to audiobooks, Sigler kinda invented ""podiobooks"" where he reads his own books and releases them part-by-part for free on iTunes as podcasts. If you just search for his name, you can find a good portion of his bibliography for free, read by him. Here's a link to the Infected Podiobook for instance.   EDIT - Grammar."

Newborn porn in Serbian Film by contrast gets a laugh, even though the action is ""worse"" than what happens in Irreversible."
horror,3aq8cd,Meph616,2,Tue Jun 23 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"These sorts of stories are one of my favorite things about horror. Specifically, one of the things that draws me to horror is its potential for transgression, the violation or disregarding of the norms of conventional society, the exploration, or at least representation, of taboo activities and ideas. Unfortunately, movies still tend towards the shallow side when it comes to breaking taboos, but even ""shock value"" is a step in the right direction.

Salo was pretty rough during parts of it but some parts made me laugh due to the craziness even thou I thought to myself I shouldn't be laughing.   Salo or men of the sun(the 731 movie) are both similar to asf to me and might be worth looking into OP

horror,3aq8cd,geengaween,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"Serbian Film made my wife sad, since then she's refused to watch horror films with me. I didn't even invite her to watch it because I knew what would happen, but she caught a glimpse of it from the doorway and stayed to watch because of the ""I'm horrified but I can't look away"" factor.  I guess I'm just desensitized because it didn't provoke any emotions from me aside from a kind of disgusted fascination with how many more lines it could cross before the movie ended. The very last bit made me laugh out loud because of how totally over the top and disgusting it was. It was like ""are these people serious with this shit?""   I didn't really enjoy it, aside from the gore effects and shocking scenes most of it was pretty boring. Same with Cannibal Holocaust. I can't really think of a shock or horror movie that's had a big impact on me. I guess I'm kind of emotionally stunted. I guess Cube, maybe? Because it's so mysterious and you never get an explanation of what the Cube is, who made it, or what it's for."

horror,3aq8cd,KennethGloeckler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"real horror is difficult to achieve. It's a complex interplay between pacing, drama, tension, story, score, actors and whole host of other contributing factors. Once achieved it is incredibly fragile, a single misjudged moment can shatter it. It's incredibly delicate but incredibly powerful. A well-crafted horror film will stay with you for years.  shock horror, on the other hand, is the equivalent of a comedian who uses swear words as punch lines.  Films like a Serbian film, cannibal holocaust etc. are just comedians who use swear words as punch lines but choose to shout them at the audience.  Not to say completely worthless, but just not very memorable. I don't think I'd revisit them."

The mirror can transcend time like it ain't no thang, which to me speaks of interdimensional powers. AND, cherry on top with spoilers, one of our protagonists winds up in an asylum. (Arkham? (Probably not)). The mirror is a totally alien artifact that slowly drives people insane for no fathomable reason = Lovecraft country!"
horror,3anlys,fittgers,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"The mirror fits the archetype of the cursed object, which doesn't necessarily mean the curse is revealed to the reader. Obviously this mirror hasn't been around since the dawn of time, someone made it. So at some point it was cursed somehow. I'm not sure it has inter dimensional powers or even the power to transcend time. It seems to have psychological control over people."

The story deals with a number of Lovecraftian themes and references which can be applied to a Dagon style plot theory, but overall nothing really supernatural or paranormal happens in the plot. (Although it can be argued that something supernatural occurs behind the main events) It's a very good police procedural action/drama, and the lead actors give amazing performances."

Clarice Starling is the focus here. The other movies don't add anything to this particular story.   The tooth fairy: Manhunter and Red Dragon. Both versions are great, and make for very different viewing experiences. These are about Will Graham. Again, it's separate from the other movies. It's a separate story. The other movies don't matter to this story.  Rising (watch this last, because it's so different): Hannibal is his own patient. It's a different story because the mystery of Dr. Lecter is peeled away. He's a very different person, because he hasn't become the wonderful monster he is in the other movies. I think this is what turns people off about the movie, but I think it's fine. In the other movies, Lecter is flawless. Or rather, he's pure. In Rising, he isn't pure.

The Halloween III idea didn't run for a reason, even if you & other horror fans really really liked it. Myers was brought back for a reason & he's in Halloweens 4-8 & remake 1 & 2 for a reason. The same reason Nightmare on Elm Street & Friday the 13th are about Freddy & Jason, respectively.  Halloween is Michael Myers. What would you call a new Michael Myers movie while retaining franchise name value? Michael Myers & Halloween are synonymous.   If there's a desire to have [holiday] Halloween/horror serials it should be done in the same vein as Trick r Treat. The Halloween brand belongs to Myers while the original idea of horror serials can be called anything at this point & start fresh.   Edit: I'm certainly not trying to bash HIII.

And I try not to think too much about the Halloween sequels, because they were all knock-offs and the franchise became what the first film was not, something more like F13th.  All that coming back from the dead has nothing to do with what I'm saying.  The violence in pretty much all of the F13 films and the Halloween sequels was cartoon violence.  It didn't have real believability at any level.  The blows didn't feel connected in a physical, brutal way.  There was no real feeling of power behind the violence, with blows, cuts and stabs you weren't walking away from.  You can feel the punches pulled, see the dull lifelessness of the stuffed limbs and torsos and other standins.  They weren't physical, they were done in a way for some make-up person to try and show off.    If Zombie's Michael swung down into your chest there was massive tissue damage, bones were likely broken and the wind would be knocked out of you and might never come back.  Kinda like trying to wrap your head around the idea that getting tackled by an NFL player would mean the same force as being hit by a car.  That connection happens, you're damaged.    Zombie's Michael was a powerful butcher.  The violence had meaning.  There are consequences. You weren't walking away from it.  And his two victims who did had lasting scars, both physical and mental.  There were consequences to his brutality.  It wasn't just theatrical.  His victims were changed forever.  They weren't just death tableau theater.  And I'm not just condemning the theatrical, contextless, over-the-top stuff in the stereotypical ""slasher"" movies.  I know a lot of people like that.  It just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  It doesn't last.  There's so few places left to go with it anymore.  The Hatchet movies are like taking that schtick to its logical next step and it comes off more funny to me and like watching a gross cartoon.  Not interested.  It doesn't mean anything.  Zombie's Michael, however, he was dangerous.  He felt dangerous.  He created a feeling that didn't exist in any of the cartoony slasher movies.  I think the closest comparison might be a few scenes with Leatherface in the original TCM, where he unceremoniously just smashes a hippy or two with believable force and physicality.  For the first time in a long time I put myself into the situations and thought about how unpleasant it would be and how much ""do not want"" he was, where the rest of them it's easy enough to imagine being able to evade, being able to hurt back.  Being much better than the simple two-dimensional fodder being dispatched.  Say what you will about Zombie's Myers' backstory and white trash aesthetic and affinity for putting his wife's ass in every movie.  He brought something back to the American slasher subgenre that it had been lacking...and might have never really had in the first place.  It's not fun (not to me).  But it sticks and psycho killers were more than just cartoon characters for a little while."

It's a movie without a real audience, except for those that will just see anything.  The people behind this should have just grown the guts to do a normal, by the number reboot and hope a new audience latches onto a commercial oriented re-franchise even if this alienates the original audience."

horror,3ale2l,8bitKatana,4,Sun Jun 21 10:02:27 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this movie for what it was, up until the ending ruined it completely.   They had a chance to take what was already an interesting story and give it some meaning, a character arc, a social commentary, a moral, etc., and instead went for a cheap twist that ruins everything that came before it.   Up until the twist ending, the movie was about fanaticism, fear, broken trust, responsibility, regret, conformity, and a number of other meaningful and interesting things. Then in one fell swoop, they literally removed every bit of meaning it could have had for the sake of a cheap, meaningless twist.   It was a very frustrating movie for me cuz it had so much potential and was so good for a while. It's a shame they couldn't follow through on what they had set up in the first place.   I know a lot of people might disagree with me, but for anyone who wants to defend it, I'd love to know what you think the movie is about. Not story wise, but meaning wise. I ask this because I think that due to the ending, the movie is devoid of meaning and I'd like to hear an argument for why I might be wrong about that."

I guess I'm trying to point out the difference between the plot and the meaning of the story."
horror,3ale2l,tariffless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:30:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the idea that a meaning is something that a film objectively has or doesn't have. Films can be interpreted all sorts of ways. I don't necessarily think this one has or needs a meaning, but if you must have one, maybe it might work for you to think of it as being about some combination of theology, vigilanteism, and capital punishment. I don't know what the filmmakers were actualy going for, but that's at least a potentially interesting interpretation.  Personally, I liked the ending. It turned Frailty from a story of merely personal horror to one of existential horror, which I always prefer(indeed, I hated the ending of The Mist adaptation because it went in the opposite direction). What's worse than fanaticism? The prospect of a universe where the being fanatics worship is actually real."
horror,3ale2l,8bitKatana,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"I totally get that movies can have different meanings to different people, depending on their personal interpretation, like how one person can read a poem and think it's about love, and the other can read it and think it's about death. My point is, I don't think this movie has ANY meaning, because whatever meaning it had been building up throughout the film was dumped overboard when they added the twist, leaving it with no meaning whatsoever.   The theology thing is still not a meaning, it's basically then just saying, ""Yeah, this stuff is real and there are demons."" That's still more story based than meaning based. The vigilantism idea could work, except we're seeing it all from Fenton's perspective the whole time, making it look like it's not about being a vigilante, but about a family being torn apart by mental illness and broken trust. So after the twist, the viewer is like, ""Oh, it's just all real? Ok,"" rather than getting to process the meaning behind the vigilante story the whole time by watching it from that perspective. The capital punishment thing is also not really what the meaning is. If it was about that, we'd have to get into whether they are demons or humans(which the movie does a bad job of demonstrating), what their rights should be, how do we go about judging and who has the right to judge, what qualifies as a fitting punishment, etc. It did none of that.   While I agree that it's scarier to think that there are demons and some holy war and all that nonsense, it's cheap in that it goes for what sounds scarier while sacrificing all the meaning it had built up. Having a twist ending isn't worth it if you're going to take away the meaning of the whole rest of the movie in the process."
horror,3ale2l,tariffless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:45:36 2015 UTC,"Sure, vigilanteism/capital punishment/theology were long shots. Again, I don't think the movie actually has a non-story-based meaning. It's logically coherent, but it's just a story and that's good enough for me. If you want a non-story-based meaning for some reason, you may have to twist some long shots in order to make them fit. An academic literary critic might be good at this sort of creative thinking."
horror,3ale2l,8bitKatana,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"I mean you say you don't think the movie has a non-story-based meaning, so then we're in agreement about that, but I think where we disagree is whether or not we think that's important in making a good movie.   I'm cool with movies having no real meaning, but having good storytelling. The problem I have with this movie is that the whole time it actively develops a lot of meaning for the characters, then changes its mind at the end. There are plenty of movies with no meaning that I love, but that's because that's what they're meant to be, that's what they seem like, and they do a good job of it. Frailty, on the other hand, poses as a meaningful movie and even does a good job of it for the most part, but then decides it's satisfied with just being a crazy story instead."
horror,3ale2l,tariffless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"I don't actually believe in ""good movies"". There are just movies, and different people enjoy different movies for different reasons, and different people will react differently to the same movie for the same reasons.  From your Shawshank Redemption example, it seems like what you're asking for is a movie to be almost a metaphor for real life. To me, ""just a crazy story whose apparent meaning isn't really there"" is better than a metaphor-- it's pretty much a description of real life, IMO."
horror,3ale2l,8bitKatana,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm... but don't you think that without meaning, the story is completely contrived and pointless? I mean aside from the entertainment value, which I already said I can appreciate in a movie that's just meant to be entertaining. I don't love Die Hard cuz of the meaning behind it. It's just an awesome movie. The difference is that Die Hard isn't pretending to be anything other than that.   If you prefer movies with no apparent meaning because they are a better mirror for how you view real life, then this still can't really be a good movie by those standards cuz it kind of gives up any semblance of reality and existentialism when it starts involving messages from god to his chosen warriors, demons disguised as people, magic axes, and all that.   There's a big difference between existential movies like The Truman Show, Groundhog Day, American Beauty, etc., which all have characters that have trouble with the meaning in their life and aren't sure what to make of it all and it's kind of up to them to figure out, and Frailty, which is about a guy who is directly told by god what the meaning of it all really is and exactly what he has to do with his life. That's the exact opposite.   It could have totally been an existential movie if they left it up for interpretation like the endings of Total Recall or Inception, or just plainly made it clear that his dad was going crazy and hallucinating, leaving Fenton to have to turn his father in to the police and figure out what to do with himself. Either way would have maintained the existential tone and been one of the movies you're talking about. As soon as they made it supernatural, they gave up being that kind of movie entirely.   I love those kind of existential movies too like you described, but I don't think Frailty can be put in the same category at all."
horror,3ale2l,tariffless,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:50:20 2015 UTC,"I don't draw that distinction between entertainment value and ""meaning"", the way you do. It makes little difference to me what a movie was ""meant"" to be. I'll be entertained if it matches my tastes.  The point of any fictional story is simply to help me pass the time by taking my imagination on a journey through another world. The only sorts of contrivances that bother me are the ones which render the fictional world internally inconsistent or boring or otherwise break my suspension of disbelief. Supernatural elements in a horror film and twist endings do none of these things. In fact, I'm a big fan of twist endings and big reveals that change everything. It appeals to my epistemological skepticism.  If I've ever used the word ""existential"" in this discussion, I meant it in reference to existential horror aka cosmic horror, a subgenre whose themes include the helplessness of humanity in the face of overwhelmingly powerful forces beyond our comprehension.   I was not talking about existentialism. You're right about existentialism's open-endedness. But existentialism's tone is too hopeful and empowering for horror, at least when it comes to my taste in horror. Existentialism emphasizes the freedom inherent in that lack of externally-imposed meaning.  There's no freedom in Frailty, because there's no negotiating or reasoning with or escaping the supernatural entity and the meaning it imposes on your life. Fenton tried, only to learn that he didn't even understand himself; his role was set in stone. Their father struggled against the full implications of his slavery(I.e. he was supposed to kill Fenton, not try to make him see the light), and he died for it. Adam submitted, and so he's under God's protection as long as he plays the game.   And I do think of what he's doing as an arbitrary game meant for little more than God's amusement. There are some things that may be crucial to understanding my perspective on this movie:    The Problem of Evil-- if there are demons, it's ""God""'s fault. If this supernatural being is so powerful, and if it actually wanted to get rid of the demons, it should've gotten rid of them itself instead of fucking with this guy's life. Hell, it shouldn't have allowed demons to exist in the first place. Forcing a guy with an axe and a list of names to run around playing demon hunter in secret isn't just needlessly cruel and passing the buck; it's stupidly inefficient. It's the sort of plan you come up with if you're trying to write a long-running tv series about monster hunters, not what you do if you actually want the demons gone.   So I consider this to be a film that's about the struggles some people go through in a world where humans really are just pawns of an unstoppable, mysterious supernatural entity.   The father turning out to be hallucinating and getting turned in would've been a happy ending in my book. It also would have been boring(to me, because I'm not personally interested in ""mental illness/fanatacism tears a family apart"") and predictable(because, again, the stupid demon slaying plan sounds like something a madman would come up with) .   Leaving it up to the audience would have been a frustrating cop out. There are answers which I'm fine leaving unanswered in a story-- mainly relatively unimportant questions of how, why, who, and what. But the question of whether the supernatural exists or not is an extremely important one which I need answered, as it impacts the fundamental nature of the world the story's set in."

GO!!!!  a few tips: - but the fast pass or wait in lines all night and only see half the houses. - wear some comfty shoes - go as many nights as possible. the houses are incredibly detailed and going through once just isnt enough to really appreciate the work put into the event - bring a poncho bc odds are you are gonna see rain..  but dont let that stop you! - bring a back pack - dont try to sneak anything into the event like weed or booze bc your bag is going to be checked at two different check points and one has a metal detector. - have fun!

I can't speak for everybody, but generally I'm not a big fan of people pushing their own agendas on this subreddit, especially ones which ask for money (which your Twitch profile does do). 2. This is your only post. Have a look around a bit and join in the discussions -- this is a really cool community, with smart people, and there are lots of neat things on here. If you get involved a bit, maybe people will be more inclined to listen to you and get interested in your stuff.  Good luck with your Twitch channel!"

I don't care about money, i'm not about money, it's just an optional thing for people if they are feeling generous and enjoying the show, i'm not going around begging for change.

It's too easy to mess up and make him look kind of goofy. This is a ramble/ observation with no point really."

I also watched The Taking of Deborah Logan and my sentiments echo everyone else's basically, that the actress who played Deb was spectacular, and that the movie was okay. I wish it had been left a bit more ""maybe magic, maybe mundane"" but I didn't hate the direction it took. The ending was also a weird one.  There were a couple of crappy horror movies that played on TV so I recorded some, and watched Devil, which was hilarious. So many ""hey it's that guy!"" moments which were distracting, and the overall plot was...kind of ridiculous. I saw the M Night Twist(tm) coming from a mile off, but my sister was scared shitless (she has an elevator fear). Good for a laugh.

The mother and daughter were great, the students, less so. I'm not usually a fan of possession movies, but this one was very interesting. I liked the take on Deborah's disease and the revelations. Hated the jumpscares. Hate all jumpscares.  The Collection: I'd seen The Collector recently and wasn't too impressed by it. I'm not really a fan of stories that rely on deathtraps, but I figured I'd complete my own collection by watching the sequel. Honestly, it just wasn't my kind of movie. That said, Josh Stewart made a badass Arkin.  Next films I'm going to watch are The Ruins and The Crazies (remake) (first time watching either, though I read The Ruins before the film was released) as well as rewatching Grave Encounters (which isn't crazy spectacular, but I love the impossible spaces and take on haunting shows.)"

horror,3al15a,scout_jem,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:38:24 2015 UTC,So bummed I never made it to the Goretorium before it closed.
horror,3al15a,ZeroNBC,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too bummed out if I were you. I went to the Goretorium before it closed and it was really underwhelming, so I wasn't surprised to hear that it had closed. It was $30.00 per person, and actually getting into the attraction took forever because of how they split the groups up. All the employees and people selling the tickets overhyped how scary it would be and it really fell flat. The best part was going to the frozen daiquiri bar they had afterwards to get drinks."
horror,3al15a,scout_jem,2,Mon Jun 22 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, the bar appealed to me most even though I don't drink. I just feel like these haunted houses are not scary. And I'm not one to go to one where they have permission to assault you."
horror,3al15a,ZeroNBC,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"I normally feel the same way about haunted houses, so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. Part of the problem for me was probably that my expectations were too high. I just thought it was going to be great because it had Eli Roth's name on it, and because of what everyone had been saying about it."

horror,3ahxqz,FartingSunshine,5,Sat Jun 20 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"Some people don't like this movie, but are probably afraid of the downvotes. I don't like this movie. IMO Its a pile of artpoop with some novel cinematography and scenes, the characters are not compelling at all and the story is boring. It's a boring, pretentious movie."
horror,3ahxqz,thewhoops,8,Sun Jun 21 06:21:14 2015 UTC,"I can understand the hate for it but I think anybody that's fairly film literate can appreciate how well made the film is. I despise Von Trier but I have to admit that he created an amazing piece of art with Antichrist. As a horror film, I found it to be an amazing work in creating dread. This is a film that forces you to be in a certain mood no matter what."
horror,3ahxqz,ThatOneTwo,9,Sat Jun 20 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's a beautifully photographed character study about grief, loss, depression and gender dynamics.  People say it's hard to sit through for the ""shock"" scenes but I suspect it's the increasing dread that disrupts viewers.  In this film, there's so much said about the nature of, well, nature being inherently evil (almost a Herzog sentiment).  The notions of ""She's"" studies kinda gives me pause and the epilogue doesn't help to dispel anything misogynistic, but I will say it's interesting.  And that I'll continue to watch it."
horror,3ahxqz,white_water,6,Sat Jun 20 11:30:04 2015 UTC,One of my favorite little details of the movie is how every other face is blurred out except the two leads.
horror,3ahxqz,mantasis,3,Sat Jun 20 15:07:31 2015 UTC,I like to imagine Von Trier took inspiration from Charlie Brown in only focusing on the main characters.
horror,3ahxqz,666lucifer,6,Sat Jun 20 20:42:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely beautifully shot film.   Probably my favorite thing about  this film was that they had Willem Dafoe use a fake penis because his actual one was too big
horror,3ahxqz,alphaj1,2,Sat Jun 20 13:51:44 2015 UTC,my balls hurt watching that film. Poor stunt balls. Great film though
horror,3ahxqz,slackingatlazyboy,3,Sat Jun 20 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"Lars Von trier's (sp?sorry) best film to me.  Incredible and one most will never forget.  Some of that imagery is shocking and incredible all at once.  I would hate to have to be an extra Oenone of his films!  Can you imagine? ""Ok extras everyone takeoff your clothes and wrestle in the mud"""

horror,3ahxqz,KicksButtson,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"Just like other movies of its type, this film gets a free pass for being ""artistic"" just because it's shot well, never mind the fact that there appears to be no real story. Seriously, the story makes no sense. A baby dies while his parents aren't paying attention, the parents deal with their grief, the father makes a terrible decision to treat his own wife's depression himself, they go to a cabin in the middle of the woods, and then some weird shit happens. What does the weird shit mean? No one really knows, everyone says something different. But hey, the film looks pretty so let's give it a pass and pretend it's one of the best horror films ever made.   Also Lars Von Trier is a total moron. Ever see the footage of the conference where he says he sympathizes with Hitler and his cast to his right and left are embarrassed to even be associated with him? Go check it out."
horror,3ahxqz,HawtSkhot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:55:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I agree. It gets a lot of praise because of its graphic representation of grief, not just the cinematography. The story isn't really the point, it's a character study of two people at the worst stages of their lives and how awful they are to each other. The story takes a backseat to Von Trier's message that everything and everyone is awful, he just uses that weird stuff to make his point. It's pessimistic, bleak, and I never really want to watch the film again, but it's hard to deny that Antichrist is art on some level.   What I do agree with you about is that Von Trier probably shouldn't be doing press. If anything, Antichrist got a lot of backlash because of its misogynistic overtones. Also, yeah, that dumb 'joke' about how he sympathizes with nazis.   Check out Melancholia if you want something that isn't nearly as convoluted as Antichrist; it's a great movie.  TL;DR Antichrist is about the people, not the story. Melancholia is better."
horror,3ahxqz,FartingSunshine,0,Sun Jun 21 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything apart from your closing ad hominem argument. It's just saying ""ooooo look at how artsy this isooooo"" and there's no real substance."

horror,3ahxqz,SyntheticGod8,0,Sun Jun 21 12:13:31 2015 UTC,"I once heard this movie describes as ""the most beautiful movie you can never show anyone else"". Seems accurate to me. Beautifully shot, good acting (though it's such a terrible idea for a psychiatrist to treat his own wife, but that's horror movies for you; making bad choices) and largely practical special effects where it counts.   That being said, at the end, my gf and I both had a violent reaction. We tried to backpedal away from what was occurring on screen... but the couch prevented us from going anywhere. It's a rare film that can shock us into allowing that kind of primal reaction to override our bodies.   In short, loved it, but not sure I want to see it again because... ow my balls."

I think there are just too many things that link them.   OH OH OH   We saw the it changed form into Elise's wife to comfort her, right? What if it's taking the form of a sickly hospital patient who has trouble breathing? For Elise, she's experienced enough that it'd have to take a really convincing form. Quinn is young and spiritually inexperienced, so it doesn't have to take a realistically human form (which might be taxing). It can just take a vaguely human shape that has enough clues so that the vulnerable Quinn would blindly believe it's her mom.   I'm just spitballing, but that'd be neat."
