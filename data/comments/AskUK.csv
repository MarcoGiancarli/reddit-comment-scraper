Some place you can get there and back in a day while your parents go look at the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and take a boat down the river or are you looking at going further afield and avoiding London altogether?    By seeing ""most of the tourist attractions in London"" what do you mean exactly? The places I've said above (ie, Westminster and The City) or have you been everywhere?

It's very unlikely that this is something the archaeology dept itself would deal with - most universities hold these records centrally and you need to speak with someone in the student records unit to get help.  I would add that generally, if you're after a transcript, calling or turning up in person will not get you the transcript any faster than simply emailling, provided you have the correct contact address."

The transcripts online request thing that you mentioned sounds like it could be what you're after (although you want originals not replacements!).  You might as well fill that one out too and see where it gets you.   Our response time for getting transcript out is usually 5 days, so if you don't hear back from them by Tuesday I would then give them a ring.

You should be able to get some form of transcript issued, and may be eligible for a lesser award such as an ordinary or general degree - that depends on your unis regulations. Alternatively you could try use the work you did back then as ""transfer credits"" to begin a new degree. I know that my university does have a concept of 'credit decay' and will devalue credits taken over a certain length of time ago, but that's a policy that differs between unis so you'd have to check with the uni you're looking at."

When I phoned the local college who had systems in place to put people in the right placements they said the government funding goes up to age 24 so most have this as a cut off. They also said in some small instances they've known a company to take on someone over 24 and the apprentice has paid for the training usually paid for by the government scheme but it was finding a company that would see this as a good option. I gave up looking in the end but have since got my foot in the door working at a school starting September part time where hopefully I'll gain valuable experience and a chance to work up a bit. 16 years in retail was 15 years too many!!! I hope you manage to find something you want to do but failing at the apprenticeship thing if you've got to pay for the training anyway have you looked at college courses? It may be worth doing a full time course for 2 years supplemented with evening work. Yes its 2 years but if you still have an income it could be an option?

Ask about that (you may have to pre-order it depending on the installer).  Alternatively, since only the openreach modem needs to connect to the master socket another solution is to run your own Cat5 cable from the loft to whereever you want to put your router."

If you don't then he in all probability will look for another solution which could be stapling the cable down the front of the house then coming in on a lower floor. Openreach are a bit hit and miss with how much work they are willing to do on an installation and going through BT can be a bit of a nightmare.  My tips would be to be there and talk the issues through with the engineer, have a good plan to where another suitable socket is and be prepared to be dissapointed if he comes up with an excuse as to why he can't do it during the installation visit."

As you say yourself it's only Fibre To The Cabinet (FTTC) so it's still copper to your house whether the modem is plugged into the master socket or further along the line, the reason the master socket is preferred is the quality of internal wiring is often poor and can have a massive impact on speeds. Any wiring past the master socket is your responsibility, so they wont fix it for free.  You may be able to request the master socket to be moved to a more convenient location, but expect there to be a charge for this. If the wire is still entering your property in the same place, then you'd still be running through the same length of copper wire anyway."

AskUK,3dyt3s,throwaway1139a,56,Mon Jul 20 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, teacher here. Without knowing the kids involved, I'll give what advice I can but, as you can imagine, it's an inexact science.    This is a horrible thing to happen to anyone, more scary because it's happening in the local area and even more so because it's the start of the summer holidays.    The kids picking on your son are doing it, I'm gauging from what you've said, because each time they do they almost manage to push him into losing his temper.  It's a game, satisfying because it's like scratching at a scab, each time they're getting a reaction and each time they're pushing him towards the stage where he'll lose it. Unfortunately, it looks like this might happen soon. When he does (I know this play against all those childhood stories about stopping bullies with a punch) the bullying will probably continue and may escalate. I can suggest a couple of things.   Firstly, there's little you can do about these bullies' behaviour yourself: they aren't your children and unless you feel confident about speaking to their parents, you can only do what you can for your own child at your end.  The days where we merrily told our kids to punch the lights out of other kids are over - it'd be assault and, at thirteen, a serious matter.  So, he should do the opposite - he needs strategies to keep his temper: he could practise strong body language, making himself appear confident even if he's not feeling it inside.  Practise with him, get someone, preferably a male, to walk up and down, practise in a mirror.  I know this sounds stupid but your instinct is right -  he must try not to react to the taunting - and doing so on the cuff is hard!   Practise shrugging his shoulders and walking on as if he doesn't give a s##t.    Not reacting at all to someone takes a lot of self-control but if he could carry it off it might well make a difference.  If they're not getting their buzz from his reaction they'll get bored, give up (and unfortunately probably move onto someone else).  Enrolling in martial arts classes, especially something like karate or kickboxing, is brilliant for self control (and also being seen in the kit locally wouldn't do any harm).    Secondly, make sure he has a phone with him at all times, and that it's charged and handy in his pocket. If things really escalate ensure he knows he has a number he can call for help if needs be - even if it's just there to make him feel safe.    Thirdly, are there activities he could take part in over the hols? Something that would take his mind off the bullying, give him a new interest and maybe allow him to make new friends?  However strong we are bullying takes its toll on self-esteem and making new friends  will allow him to see the bullies in their proper perspective and increase his confidence when he sees them again. I can't recommend this enough.   Lastly, when the holidays are over go back to the school.  They are right in that events that happen outside are out of their remit.  Once out of the school gates, children involved are then the responsibilty of their parents.  But if this is happening IN SCHOOL, then there ARE things they could do and should be doing.  Unfortunately, as with most things in life, it's the people who push who get what they want and schools often prefer to stick their necks in sand rather than act.   I hope this has been helpful, sorry it's not a magic bullet to make the whole thing go away.  Bullying is a horrible thing but you sound like a loving caring parent, just hang in there!"

I can't recommend this enough.   I wanna echo this. I was bullied pretty relentlessly at school and if that was all I had I would not have coped. Having Scouts and my drama group to fall back on gave me the chance to mix with different kids who didn't know about all of my baggage from school. Sadly for OP's son, the timing couldn't really be much worse, everything shuts down for school holidays, but when term starts back up I would absolutely point him in this kind of direction."

They always try and stick their nose into kid's business outside of school, unless it's something actually important. If you are got in a fight outside of school wearing the school uniform or riding your bike without a helmet they'd be on you like a ton of fucking bricks, but bullying? Outside of our remit, sorry.  It's fucked. And I'm sorry for the rant, but it's bad enough that we've stripped away the ability for individuals to do anything for themselves but the people we are forced to hand that power to are far worse. We've done nothing but breed a generation of kids who have no sense of self worth, feel they can't change anything and are completely reliant on others.  And the advice you gave is probably good concerning how it is, but in my experience the whole 'take it on the chin and don't give them a reaction' approach earns just as many laughs and the kid becomes a punchbag because everyone knows they can take the piss out of him and he's not gonna do anything apart from that thing where he pretends to laugh along with it and walk off like he always does.

AskUK,3dyt3s,How2999,0,Tue Jul 21 11:41:30 2015 UTC,"Very familiar with DPA. You should perhaps study up on the DPA Principles. Schools processing data on an individual's disciplinary background is a lawful and relevant activity.  The DPA does absolutely nothing to prevent a school - for instance - asking for a reference from an individual's previous school and the previous school stating that they were expelled for beating up classmates or violent behaviour.  Just as schools and 6th form colleges provide a reference in support of UCAS Applications. It's absolutely not illegal to provide a reference of that nature.  DPA does not prevent a data handling entity making factually accurate statements regarding an individual where there is a proper reason for doing so.  It merely requires Data Handlers to only collect relevant data, protect the data, only process it for lawful and reasons and ensure it's destruction when it ceases to be relevant.  See here for information from the ICO on School Records.  [quote]As a parent, what sort of information can I access?  If your child attends a maintained school, you have a right to access your childâs educational record. This covers information that comes from a teacher or other employee of a local authority or school, the pupil or you as a parent, and is processed by or for the schoolâs governing body or teacher, except for information the teacher has solely for their own use. So it will cover information such as the records of the pupilâs academic achievements as well as correspondence from teachers, local education authority employees and educational psychologists engaged by the schoolâs governing body. It may also include information from the child and from you, as a parent. Information provided by the parent of another child would not form part of a childâs educational record.[/quote]  Notice the bit about information from Local Education Authorities? The other thing is that the power of head teachers to make expulsions has been curtailed in recent years, requiring sign-off for certain things from their LEA. Ergo, certain disciplinary data, as well as things like Statements of Special Education Needs (where schools are sharing SEN resources) are going to be floating at an LEA level, not a school level, and could be made available to other schools where relevant."

The kids bullying are looking to make him angry. He has 2 realistic options to make it stop, he could completely ignore it, don't respond, possibly even laugh along, they'll think he doesn't care and if they aren't getting a reaction they want they will most likely stop. Saying that, kids are arseholes, so if that doesn't work there's the second option.  I'm not one to advocate violence, but in the 6 weeks off a fight between kids isn't going on anyone's record.

If neither of these apply try friends and family, maybe mention on Facebook if you have an account that you want to rehome him. If all that fails then try advertising, don't offer him for free and don't lie on the advert. People will want to know if he is child friendly, pet friendly, good with dogs both strange or known to him and if he has any health or behavioural issues. Ask lots of questions when someone enquires and be suspicious if they don't ask many questions themselves. Gumtree is one of the lower quality places to advertise, Preloved is slightly better, as it Pets4homes.

We certainly weren't after the blitz cleared large chunks of city centres, and after industrial decline left more land empty. Gradually, we've filled these patches in, but only London has come close to completing that process, even Manchester has large empty post-industrial brownfield sites within a few minutes' walk of the city centre.  Another big issue is geology. It's much easier to build upwards if you've got Manhattan's rock to sink your foundations into, rather than London's clay and chalk. Not so much of an issue with more modern construction techniques, but historically a big factor, and sinking massive long piles into central London isn't necessarily an option due to the likelihood of something (tunnels, sewers, etc.) being in the way."

A lot of these were never properly documented and some of them are or were secret, like the Kingsway telephone exchange, which was designed to survive a nuclear bomb and keep crucial phone lines operational. The Government/BT also has a secret network of tunnels under London plus various bomb shelters etc.  All this means plus the soil you can't just go sinking foundations for skyscrapers - you have to plan it all out carefully and there are some things you wouldn't be able to move out of the way."

AskUK,3dxgef,hoffi_coffi,2,Mon Jul 20 12:36:37 2015 UTC,"There are lots of very odd planning rules in London that effect skyscrapers. It's all got to do with st Paul's cathedral, which must remain un obscured from various angles.  This is why the big boring ones are east in the isle of dogs, and the ones in the centre sometimes have interesting shapes  For example, the cheese grater is that shape so that it does not effect the view of st Paul's from fleet street. Another factor is that there are pretty much no big square footprints, due to the very old street layout which has not changed since London grew organically. This is one of the reason London has some of the most interesting architecture in the world.   These interesting shapes and designs requiring clever architecture and building methods.

When I was in Sixth Form (in Manchester), huge numbers of people applied for it even if they had no chance in hell in getting there. Part of this is that it's pretty close to manchester, but it's massively popular these days for it's atmosphere.  One thing I would say about leagues is that it's entry requirements are a bit inflated due to it's popularity - don't get me wrong it's still a great university, but if you haven't been accepted or applied for it yet I would bear it in mind.  Bristol is another fantastic cultural city, and a great university. Not all of it is nice, but I prefer it to Leeds personally, and if you're desperate to go to London often it's much more hand. Also, a lot of buildings are covered in street art which lends the place a bit of a charm and I personally quite like.  I wouldn't worry about any university in the UK not being lively though. I go to a campus university which is outside a relatively small city and is probably a quite quiet university in the grand scheme of things, but if you want to go out to a club, drink a lot and do some bizzare extracurricular activities you absolutely can, and Bristol and Leeds are bound to be much more lively than where I study."
AskUK,3e0zgm,lgf92,4,Tue Jul 21 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"I'll speak up for Leeds as other posters have spoken up for Bristol:   the cost of living is genuinely quite low for the UK. I pay Â£325 a month along with four other tenants for a five-bedroom house just outside the city centre (2 minutes from the General Infirmary) with huge bedrooms in a safe area.  it's much bigger than Bristol: Leeds is the third-biggest city in the UK by some definitions and has 800,000 people at the smallest count.  it has a huge student culture with three universities plus private ones. It also has an interesting alternative culture and, in terms of things to do at night, everything from craft bar pubs to old man pubs to multi-storey nightclubs. It has massive shopping centres as well with more or less every chain store in the UK having a branch.  it's well connected, on the East Coast mainline around two and a half hours from London by train and the same time to Edinburgh in the north. It's also got Leeds Bradford Airport which is a major Ryanair hub for cheap flights to Europe. I flew to Milan from there myself for about thirty quid all in. What's more it's only 45 minutes from Manchester on the train which is even bigger with an even more comprehensive airport.  it's very diverse, not only in terms of its student population, but generally. This means that there are different festivals, foods and so on which make it a genuinely interesting place to live."

AskUK,3dzbbe,buried_treasure,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's illegal to cause an unnecessary obstruction of a road. It must legally be a public road  (not a private road/path which is not an offence but is a civil matter including civil trespass). If someone is accompanying the vehicle and refuses to move it from obstructing the road, the police can fine the driver on the spot and also remove his vehicle.  If the vehicle is unaccompanied and causing an unnecessary obstruction, the police can choose to issue a fine (which is left on the window on display) OR have the vehicle seized/removed to a car impound. Usually a vehicle is removed when it is blatantly blocking a road preventing pedestrians or vehicles from travelling through.  The only exemptions would be:   If it was blocking the road for an emergency (i.e. it was a necessary obstruction) Temporarily for deliveries/access (e.g. loading/unloading a delivery) unless street signage indicates otherwise.   Ordinarily blocking a road would be a non-emergency call to the police (101) however if it poses a risk of serious injury to someone or there is a risk of serious damage, it could be treated as an emergency (999)."

Besides that she's managed to steer the institution of the monarchy itself through some incredibly sticky patches. Admittedly she's had a very astute public relations team to help and advise her, but in a world where hereditary monarchies are very much an anachronism she's (mostly) succeeded in keeping the backing of the general public."

The queen also did some work in the forces in the war. Both these decisions put the family on a strong footing for the end of the century. Over the years the queen has supported the political system 'well' in that she has appeared to support when needed and challenge when required. Before the various divorces and affairs, her family did a decent job of supporting this. The public loved Diana and the William and Harry growing up period before Diana's untimely passing. Don't forget the popularity of the Queen Mother and the Queen's sister during this period, both of whom passed. Internationally the Queen has consistently spoken out in favour of the improving living conditions and standards for the citizens of the commonwealth, over the years she spoke out against apartheid, Mugabe and other situations where commonwealth citizens were suffering.  During this whole period the royal family's positive effect on tourism has grown exponentially - visit Buckingham palace during any weekend or holiday period if you're unsure."

AskUK,3e0x2b,ab00,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:16 2015 UTC,"Not everyone thinks highly of her but I do, and it's for a few reasons. One is how she handles herself in difficult situations. Someone broke into her bedroom and she was alone with them for some time and managed to stay calm. Someone shot at her while she was on a horse and she managed to stay calm.  She speaks with the prime minister every week and has done for many many years. She has travelled the world. She has met incredible people. I have a respect and admiration for the amount of knowledge she must hold in her head!  She does make many decisions for herself. I believe she made the decision to try to mend relations with Ireland. She has shaken hands with people we thought she never would. She has visited places in Ireland we never thought she would. It is extremely important that she has done this and she really didn't have to.  After victory was declared in the war she went out and partied in London like a normal person!  She was a good sport and appeared in a short Bond clip for the Olympics.  She speaks fluent French so does not need an interpreter when she visits countries where it is the first language.

AskUK,3e0x2b,JeffMartinsMandolin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"The Queen is actually pretty busy in the background working on our behalf and on behalf of a lot of people around the world. She keeps up to date on political matters, mainly from the UK but she does get general briefing on the goings-on of all the countries she is head of state for, and will get specific details if she is interested in a particular topic. The Queen has her own Government red box (A ministerial briefcase, the tradition of which dates back to Prince Albert in the 1860s) and is known in Government circles as Reader Number 1. She gets copies of all of the important documents even if they don't require royal assent just because she is interested in keeping up with the goings on of her government.  This naturally means that when she speaks to the Prime Minister in a weekly Audience, or with the Scottish First Minister when she's in Balmoral, or when she meets other ministers (for example the Chancellor on Budget day) she asks questions, gets clarification, and whilst not officially expressing an opinion the fact that she asks questions and makes the ministers think about things means they have to be sure about what they are saying.  Apart from that, the Queen hosts events for all sorts of people - she holds yearly garden parties for people who have served their communities with distinction, she meets her Govenors General on a regular basis (the Govenors General act as the Queen's representatives in countries where she is head of state), new diplomats posted to the UK formally present their credentials to her regularly, she hosts dinners and parties for groups, ranging from the England football team to Americans living in the UK, as well as formal Banquets for visiting dignitaries (like Obama, Chiraq, Pratibha Patil (a former President of India) etc etc).  Besides that, she makes lots of visits to various places inside the UK - things like openings of important buildings, visiting wounded servicemen, and just generally being seen. There are also tours of foreign countries - for example the Queen visited Germany in June of this year, and visited the USA in 2007.  When she makes speeches, most of the time (with the notable exception of the Queen's Speech on the opening of parliament) she has a lot of input into them and will usually decide the theme and main points and will approve the final draft (possibly followed by the Foreign Office if a foreign power is involved).  There are also state occasions in the Queen's calendar, like the State Opening of Parliament, Trooping the Colour and the Garter Ceremony, and the Queen is also head of many charities which she gives up some time for.  The Queen is also responsible for the administration of the Royal finances and the palaces and other buildings. She is also in overall control of the Royal transport, which consists of one helicopter and the Royal Train, plus occasional use of the jets of the Royal Flight of the RAF (when they aren't busy being used as navigational trainers) or the hiring of British Airways aircraft (or parts thereof) for longer overseas visits.  And on top of all that she is a mother, a grandmother and a great grandmother, and has to work in running a large family.  The Queen, in her limited downtime, is also very fond of horses and horse racing, and takes a keen interest in her stud farms - it's said she knows the names of all of her horses by heart, and their lineage up to Grandmother level. She attends Ascot yearly (both as a state occasion and for fun) and often goes to watch her husband in his carriage driving events."

Email the university in NZ and ask them what you need to do / provide in order to transfer to them. I did an exchange with a foreign university and I needed to provide transcripts, a letter of recommendation, vaccination certificates etc.  Email Roehampton and ask whether they have a formal procedure for transferring. How much of your tuition will you have to pay if you move before the end of the first year etc? In both cases keep your questions concise and fact based.

AskUK,3dztvk,DijonWolfie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely not.

He is driving without due care and attention and on the evidence of this video could face a conviction.   Perhaps what would help is if I present the correct situation:  1)By approaching the junction slower the Lorry driver would have time to asses the access point to the road and would require a much smaller turning circle.  2) As he begins to turn he should notice the motorbike heading down the road - the motorbike should be clearly visible (It is bright white), travelling slowly and is on the correct side of the road.  3) The lorry should at all times during this manoeuvre be prepared to stop.  4) With a reduced turning circle and slower speed the lorry driver would have been much less on to the far side of the road, enabling the motorbike to position himself closer to the curb, and the lorry to complete the manoeuvre, ending it with a courteous wave.  Whenever you're driving you need to be aware of your surroundings at all times. You have to drive with ""Due care and attention"" and it is very clear that Lorry drive has no appreciation of his/his lorry's capabilities nor the position of other road users."

In an insurance dispute we tend to assign some amount of ""contributing negligence"" to the person making the claim. With this evidence it would be pretty much impossible to assign any to the motorcyclist. Basic rules of thumb (obvious pinch of salt applies here) to assign fault in an accident. Are you on the wrong side of the road? If you have an accident and you're in the wrong place this will count against you. Was one party stationary? If so the other person has hit that party and will be assigned a greater amount of blame. were you breaking the speed limit (or doing anything else illegal). If so you will be assigned more of the blame.  Here we see the lorry hit the stationary bike while on the wrong side of the road. It's about as clear-cut as it gets.

AskUK,3e0cvf,crownsandclay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"I work at a train station ticket office.  You are allowed to buy a 16-25 railcard valid for 1 year up to the day before your 26th birthday.  If you have lost your railcard and want to get a replacement you have to bring in your railcard receipt that you would have been given. That will have the original expiry date on. If you have just straight up lost the railcard and don't have the receipt you will not get a replacement.   The only way to play the system is if you had your railcard stolen. You would then need to go into the ticket office with your crime reference number. When you get there it is between you and the clerk to decide when the expiry date is, we encourage you to be honest but there's nothing stopping you doing the scummy thing and saying you bought it like a week ago."

AskUK,3dx7im,duluoz1,56,Mon Jul 20 07:39:01 2015 UTC,Personally I would stick with suit and tie. Being one level up in smartness from your interviewers is no problem.
AskUK,3dx7im,TheAntiqueTraveller,12,Mon Jul 20 07:43:35 2015 UTC,This. There's never a good reason not to go suited and booted to any interview. I've never heard of anyone being refused a job because they looked too smart.
AskUK,3dx7im,jaynoj,10,Mon Jul 20 09:03:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If it's an office based interview, just wear a suit. Unless it's an extreme creative field no one ever has said ""look at this prick, who wears a suit to an interview?""."
AskUK,3dx7im,Perite,8,Mon Jul 20 11:46:00 2015 UTC,Better be wearing a suit when its not expected than not be wearing one when it is expected
AskUK,3dx7im,MrHiym,-10,Mon Jul 20 11:18:05 2015 UTC,I disagree. If an employer expects me to wear a suit then I don't want to work there anyway. Better to wear normal clothes and be comfortable.

However, before my most recent (second) interview I was informed that it was on casual Friday and that I should dress appropriately.

AskUK,3dx7im,oblong89334,9,Mon Jul 20 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"The basic rule is to dess formally for the interview, regardless of the company's dress policy.  I've been an interviewer before at companies where the staff work in t-shirts and jeans, but we would have a mildly negative first impression if any interviewees turned up  themselves dressed like that. Not necessarily enough to reject them out of hand, but if the choice were between two otherwise equal candidates then the one who'd taken the trouble to dress for the interview rather than looking like he'd just rolled in off the street without giving it a moment's thought, would be the one more likely to get offered the position."
AskUK,3dx7im,How2999,2,Mon Jul 20 08:22:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. I work in a hospital, where you can't wear a suit when doing your job normally because long sleeves are banned for infection control. It's still expected that we wear suits to interview."

Definitely if it is the kind of place that has a vague dress code even on dress down days. if it was some trendy hipster design studio where they come in wearing flip flops then I would say take it down a level, but still a shirt and tie."

AskUK,3dx7im,jonewer,2,Mon Jul 20 09:55:52 2015 UTC,Suit and tie!!!!  I made the mistake of wearing casual cos it was a Friday.  Do not do this!
AskUK,3dx7im,leedsimpson,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:42 2015 UTC,Cheers. As others have said I can always take the tie off if I feel overdressed. Harder to go from informal to formal I guess!  So you didn't get the job?

AskUK,3dxg4l,veryoddsocks,12,Mon Jul 20 09:47:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I would house share anyway. Its a good experience. You dont want to live on your own in your 20s anyway, its no fun. And expensice. Get your own place once you get partner, for sure, but on your own you would be bored shitless and broke. You can get a shared room with bills for that budget easy. In cambridge (much dearer than nottingham) i was paying 525 all in (rent, council tax, bills, tv and internet). You could probably get one for much less (when i was up in dundee many years ago i was doing the same for 350 or so.)  source: did that"
AskUK,3dxg4l,t90fan,3,Mon Jul 20 10:03:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  Personally, when I bought my flat 12 months ago, I'd never lived on my own before. The first six months of living here were actually a bit pish. There were certain benefits, it's true - like, for instance, nothing ever changed from how I left it, there were never any lights left on by mistake, I could sleep wherever I wanted without anyone thinking I was weird, it didn't matter what state the place was in because it was only going to be me in it anyway, and etc, but most of those advantages ended up just being to my detriment. I became lazy, my flat became messy, and all in all, things became pretty fucking boring. Having nobody around meant I had no impetus to keep things to a standard.  So, I decided to take on a lodger. I had a friend of a friend come round, we shared a beer and discussed terms, shook on it, and a month later he was in. Since then, things have been an order of magnitude better. I'm much happier, the flat feels much more lively, and I've actually got a reason to keep the place in decent condition and to continuously improve things. He's happy too, and certainly seems to be having a much better time of it here than he was in his last place.  Bringing it back to the OP's question about finances, putting it into comparison, the girl next door to us pays Â£780 per month for her rent plus property-related bills. My lodger pays a flat rate of Â£280, all included. On any income, I don't think it's hard to argue against that sort of saving, even if it is at the expense of living with someone who occasionally falls asleep in the exceedingly cosy little space under his desk."
AskUK,3dxg4l,BillionBalconies,4,Mon Jul 20 12:22:40 2015 UTC,Not everyone wants to live with other people. I found sharing very stressful and do much better on my own. I certainly am not bored shitless with my own company and not having to deal with other people's crap!
AskUK,3dxg4l,carmen_verandah,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:45 2015 UTC,I haven't totally ruled out sharing. I'm just quite a private person and like a lot of alone time. It would have to be someone who I could click well with and who would have the same energy levels as me.
AskUK,3dxg4l,MDKrouzer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"I stayed in a house share in Bulwell (I think) for Â£400 per month all inclusive (rent and all bills) about 5 years ago. I didn't socialise much with my housemates because I'd spend most weekends travelling, but I never had any issues with them. I mostly stayed in my room and just used the shared kitchen and bathroom. I also prefer a lot of alone time so it worked pretty well for me."

AskUK,3dxg4l,HeadTorch,3,Mon Jul 20 10:01:01 2015 UTC,"The initial move and set-up of a flat is fairly costly.  Security deposit, first month's rent, reference check fee, TV license, furniture, cookware, moving equipment & rentals, internet, etc.  If you can comfortably cover all these things with money you've saved up and budgeted accordingly going forward, give it a shot.  I'd also recommend having an emergency fund of 6+ months before moving out."
AskUK,3dxg4l,onetruebipolarbear,2,Mon Jul 20 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"You should be able to get somewhere in Nottingham for that price, when I first moved up here the contract I was on left me with about that per month, and I was able to rent a one bed flat by myself.   If you're looking to focus on saving, look for a house share.   How far is your commute?"
AskUK,3dxg4l,SuffragettePizza,2,Mon Jul 20 10:59:04 2015 UTC,"I have a few friends who are renting a house between them fine on a mix of an apprentice wage (~Â£12k) and student loans, I think there's 4 of them (2 couples) sharing a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house in North tyneside so it's certainly doable around here, although I couldn't speak for property prices in Nottingham"
AskUK,3dxg4l,mrs_shrew,2,Mon Jul 20 11:43:52 2015 UTC,"If you want to save, you're much better off in a house share. House sharing as a working adult is generally a bit different than sharing as a student - it's less living with a bunch of mates and more just sharing a building. Most of the people I know who live in house shares don't really interact with their housemates past having a chat in the kitchen sometimes, it's more like having neighbours than housemates. All of my friends who share live pretty comfortably and manage to save a fair bit each month - it's definitely preferable in my eyes to living alone!  I lived on my own in Leicester which is relatively comparable in price to Nottingham, and I basically had nothing left at the end of the month. I chose to live alone for much of the same reasons you posted. It was do-able but it wasn't very fun because I couldn't save anything and I didn't have enough money to go out and do anything.  Bare in mind that you'll also have to factor in random stuff that you normally take for granted, too (optician, dentist, prescriptions, additional journeys, additional food, clothes, shoes etc.) and that tends to eat away at any of the money you have left!"
AskUK,3dxg4l,kezza596,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:36 2015 UTC,House share for a year so buying stuff can be spread out instead of all in one hit. You'll get to neet new people and experience new things away from your family.  It will also teach you to be responsible for your stuff and respectful of other people.

AskUK,3dxfl2,cloud70,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:36 2015 UTC,"I looked into this a few years back when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do career-wise...   Any media jobs are going to be VERY competitive, my best advice would be to start off in local or community radio stations on a voluntary basis. You'll gain some much needed experience whilst hopefully being able to spot some opportunities to progress onto paid work.  If you can get on the BBC scheme you mentioned, that would be a huge bonus. As I mentioned though, that might be difficult due to high demand.  I found out about this course when I went to the job centre (we are going back nearly 10 years here...) and it was really great for laying a foundation of knowledge.  Not sure where you are located but this course was based at the Aston Villa ground in Birmingham. As you can see, that page hasn't been updated in a long time but I would suggest contacting Mike Owen, he's very well connected in UK media and I believe used to be head commissioner at ITV (don't quote me on that though!)

AskUK,3dxfl2,WheresTheBossKey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"A common way for people to get into the radio industry back then was to start working in media sales (as in TV, radio and magazine ads), I don't know if that's still true today.

AskUK,3dzo77,NikkiJayne28,3,Mon Jul 20 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Hiya!  I recently moved from the Netherlands to the UK (Scotland), and while I can't say anything about moving from the UK to another country, I can tell you a bit about moving to a different country in general.  For me, the language is no problem. In the Netherlands most people speak English (apart from the elderly, maybe). I have some friends from Scandinavia and Germany and in general their English is very good.   In normal day-to-day life in the countries you mentioned you will be able to manage with just English. However, some jobs might require fluency in Dutch/German/Swedish/whatever. So if you're serious about moving, try to start learning the language. There are loads of apps and websites with free content to start learning a language.  Obviously I don't know what field you're in, it might well be that business in this field is mostly conducted in English, even abroad, anyway. And if not, then there will always be jobs for English speakers, for instance in tourism, customer service, or the service industry (e.g. pubs). Jobs for English speakers might be easier to find in larger (touristy) cities.   In my case, I moved before I had a job. I had money saved up so this was no problem. If you want to do it this way, make sure you have enough money saved up. Do some research on rent prices in different areas, and cost of living. Don't forget things like transport, and look into things like health insurance. In the Netherlands, this is compulsory, and you'll either be paying monthly or for a few/6/12 months in advance. If you decide to move before finding a job, do consider a worst-case scenario (e.g. being unable to find a job within x amount of time, having to move back to the UK), and make sure that even in the worst-case scenario you can support yourself or move back to the UK if necessary.  Without knowing what sector you're in, it's difficult to tell you how to find a job. I know that for some fields, there are jobsites which advertise jobs in the UK as well as in the rest of Europe. Try to find out if there's such a website. Otherwise, just try googling around. A quick Google of 'looking for job in EU' led me to this website (Disclaimer: no idea if it's any good, did not look at it). There must be more websites like this around. Maybe this website has some good tips?  As for settling in, in my personal experience this was not so difficult as I moved in with my boyfriend, who is from the country I moved to. If you're on your own, and you don't know anyone in the country you're moving to, be prepared to do a lot of research before you move, and also when you've moved. A simple thing as where to buy certain products can be quite difficult in a new country. I mean, H&M and fastfood restaurants are the same everywhere, but if you need to buy towels or bedsheets then you might need to wander around for a bit to find out where to get these things. (Of course, amazon is always an option :P)  In my experience, it's these little things that can be quite frustrating or stressful. Not knowing where to find certain information, where to buy X, or who to contact about Y can get tiring. Good thing many countries have their own subreddits where you can ask your questions ;)  As for making friends, I think it's similar to making friends in any new place: try joining clubs/societies/organisations to meet people who have the same interests. You'll meet people at work as well. As a student, I had loads of international friends. Again though, this might be easier in a larger (student?) city. It's not required that you speak the local language, but it's probably easier when you do. People are hardly ever as confident in expressing themselves in their second language than in their first, and they might switch over to their first language to talk to the rest of the group, which may make you feel left out. I guess taking a language class would also be a good place to get to know people!  I've already made this post wayyyy too long. If you have any more questions or even questions specifically about the Netherlands, let me know! You can send me a pm if you want :)"

If you are going during a busy week/weekend and you want to use their restaurant then I strongly suggest you buy a dining plan in advance because you will almost certainly be turned away most days and be stuck with the well overpriced Burger King etc. The quality of the food in the standard restaurant is ok, very edible but nothing to write home about. The premium food however is much better and well worth paying the extra in my opinion, although it's buffet style much of it is cooked fresh in front of you and the quality of the food is a lot better although the amount of choice available is about the same. You get breakfast and evening meal, not lunch. One thing to note though, we find the food to be better in Skegness than Minehead."

If you're not given one, then ask why.   Does the job pay OK?   Purely depends on the hours you put into it. You do have to pay the company for use of their car - which can be around Â£200 per week (depends on car and location).   Do these companies really offer enough work?   Nope. They simply give you a student, and you have to arrange it with the student when they do the hours/work etc. Sometimes if you're lucky (during the summer for example) you get around 5 or 6 new students, and that translates to 5 or 6 extra hours per week.   How did you pay for the training?   Cash.   Anything else I should know?   Unless you're regularly working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week (which a lot of instructors don't), then it can be hard-pressed at times to get by.

It's not complicated; if you have some common sense, you realise that the laws and code make a lot of sense. It's designed to keep you safe, alert and informed on the road. If you do around 3 - 4 weeks of intense study (including the hazard perception test) then you should be okay.  You don't have to get driving lessons to sit your test - they don't ask if you have, although you do need to bring your own car - having an instructor helps with this. However, an instructor can tell you what the examiners look out for. They're notorious for failing you for simple things such as not looking at the mirror enough.  It seems like you're taking the driving tests quite lightly - and to be fair to ensure you pass the first time around, take it a bit seriously. Not saying it's the be-all and end-all, but if you understand that you can be failed for the smallest of infringements, then you'll understand that you need to tighten up and really learn it properly.  The hazard perception part of the theory test is particularly difficult for some people."

AskUK,3dxmvp,MDKrouzer,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend you take at least do an hour lesson with a qualified instructor.

There are numerous resources for what you need to know available.  The main thing about passing the test if you already drive well is making sure you do things by the book, that means making clear the examiner sees you looking in the mirror when you should do, obeying all speed limits, other directions on road signss, priorities at junctions.  If I were you I'd take one lesson and see what the instructor thinks."

I tried both the books and the apps, and I found the books were much more useful and I would recommend those. The apps are good as test simulation though.  It is not necessary to get driving lessons, but you need to take a car to the test to satisfy their criteria. Having said that, I was in a similar position to you and can say with almost full certainty that I would not pass the test without driving lessons. Its not driving that they test as much as being safe on the road and all the checks, which one tends to forget when one has been driving for several years. Additionally, reverse parking (lateral) is something that I needed to ""learn"" properly...mostly because they don't accept lateral parking the way one does it in practice."

Also - explore other sections of the site, it's really helpful and pretty in-depth to be honest. The theory isn't that hard but hazard perception can be a bit tricky, and for the driving test itself I'm 99% sure you need to bring 'your own' car, so if you don't have one, you'll be able to use an instructor's car for that (but you'd need to pay, obviously)."
AskUK,3dxmvp,heidurzo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"The theory test is easy. Being a non-EU migrant you're likely reasonably intelligent so you should know enough to pass well after 2 or 3 days of hard study. Read a summary of the highway code and take a few practice tests, do a mock hazard perception test as well but you won't fail this unless you have the reflexes of a sloth.  There's no restriction requiring driving lessons before the test but it's a good idea to have at least an hour so you know where you are and won't waste time/money on the test if you're not up to scratch. The standard of driving required to pass the UK test is drastically higher compared to most of the rest of the world, the US driving test is a literal joke among driving instructors. This is why non-EU migrants are required to take the test after a year, there's a common agreement across the EU to maintain a reasonable standard of driving tests."

(I'm in the same position as the OP, born and lived in England all my life, British citizen in the eyes of British law, but I've only held an Irish passport.)  Also, an added thought: bear in mind that Irish citizens have unlimited right to residence in the UK (and have had so since Irish independence, it's quite separate from EU freedom of movement). The rights for non-EU partners to reside probably apply equally to Irish citizens anyway."
AskUK,3dtsn1,AberStans,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:45 2015 UTC,Not many. The Irish one is probably better for travelling too since Ireland doesn't get into the same shit the UK does. Iran for example is far easier for Irish passport holders than British ones. Being Irish already allows you to do things that other passport holders can't in the UK (joining the army for example).

Both Irish and British people need a visa for India, but it will cost a British person Â£82 before fees, while it is Â£36 for an Irish person. And Ireland will soon be added to the list of visa on arrival countries while we will still have to pay the high price and faff on getting the visa in the UK.  For China an Irish person will pay 40 euros, but a British person will pay Â£66 overall.  And Iran where both British and Irish people need a visa, but Irish people can move much more freely around Iran than we can.  And Irish people are going to be less hated worldwide so you'd probably risk more grief travelling on a British passport."
AskUK,3dtsn1,crownsandclay,5,Sun Jul 19 12:46:55 2015 UTC,"It's more than 3 countries.  And those are certain countries, for other countries you pay more as an Irish citizen.

AskUK,3dvr2d,Geekmonster,0,Sun Jul 19 23:19:23 2015 UTC,"Which means the BBC would have to move to either a pay-per-view basis online, which would likely kill them as their market share would be severely impacted, or they would have to become a commercial broadcaster with adverts, which would kill their royal charter and would mean they would have to rewrite a lot of policies and work out a lot of legal issues.  Either of these moves would harm their programming, as the BBC has a guaranteed source of income they take programming risks with series and shows that other networks would reject as being too risky to take at the beginning. Yes, they make a crapload from things like Dr Who, but ITV make a lot from soaps like Emmerdale Farm or Coronation Street and they don't take the programming risks the BBC do.  So we'd be worse off in my opinion if either of these things happened.

AskUK,3dt69w,CabinOfWood,16,Sun Jul 19 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"The canned tomatoes thing has me intrigued. As far as I know, even in Italy where the tomatoes are canned, canned tomatoes are used.  They're too seasonal otherwise."
AskUK,3dt69w,CptBigglesworth,4,Sun Jul 19 08:51:34 2015 UTC,"I suspect that many Italians wouldn't tolerate the imported, horribly underripe tomatoes that are sold in the UK (and not just out of season, sadly). I don't see using canned tomatoes as in the same league as using a pre-prepared pasta sauce, as an example."
AskUK,3dt69w,fsv,4,Sun Jul 19 11:09:00 2015 UTC,I agree that there's a huge difference between canned tomatoes and jars of pasta sauce. I think the process of making canned tomatoes is a vital one in their taste - some people cook and can their own.
AskUK,3dt69w,CptBigglesworth,9,Sun Jul 19 11:16:37 2015 UTC,"A bit of both really. Rarely everything is completely made from scratch.  For example, last night I cooked some ready-made fresh stuffed pasta from a packet (screw making/stuffing my own pasta), but baked it with homemade cheese sauce (flour, butter, milk, cheese).  Tinned tomatoes and fresh tomatoes are basically separate foodstuffs in my mind for different things. If I tried to make a bologneise with fresh tomatoes it would come out shit I reckon. Likewise, you wouldn't serve tinned tomatoes with a salad (I would hope!)"
AskUK,3dt69w,blazemore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:45:21 2015 UTC,"I LOVE making pasta sauce with fresh tomatoes (not that I do it every time).  Its pretty simple:  Take a whole bunch of tomatoes, pour boiling water on them and remove after a minute to make it easy to take the skins off.  Then get some garlic and onions frying up, chop the toms and remove the watery stuff inside.  Add them to the onions/garlic, cook for 10 minutes then blend them with a shit load of fresh basil.  Add seasoning, chili etc to taste while frying it all up.  I swear to god this results in a depth of flavour you can't possibly get with a jarred sauce.  Does add an extra 20-30 minutes to the process though so I only do it when I have the time..."

I don't buy ready meals or much in the way of frozen things (burgers etc), I find the supermarket stuff quite bland, especially when it comes to curries or tagines.

AskUK,3dt69w,Iosif_ravenfire,6,Sun Jul 19 07:56:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think using tinned tomatoes is like eating a ready meal - it's still ""cooking from scratch"", just with longer-life ingredients.  The quality of ""fresh"" tomatoes in the UK is generally poor (unless you grow them yourself, and are good at it). Supermarkets favour tomatoes that look good over ones that taste good, and most tomatoes are not grown in the UK (I have a suspicion that the best tomato varieties grown in the Mediterranean region do not travel well). I almost always use tinned tomatoes because they tend to taste better.  Also, tinned kidney beans and so on are not really an alternative to fresh beans, which are highly seasonal. They replace dried beans, which need to be soaked for hours before you can cook with them (I'm talking about ordinary tinned beans, not baked beans in a sauce).  I think it's still ""cooking from scratch"" if you use a tin of tomatoes and a tin of beans to make some chilli. ""Eating out of a tin"" would mean buying that pre-made tinned chilli that looks like dog food."

I don't like baking, so I buy premade bread and cakes, and if I'm making a pie I'll buy premade pastry and add my own filling.  Ready meals are for when I truly can't be arsed though.

Things like sardines or tuna also, but it depends on the dish you are making. A lovely fresh salsa you want fresh tomatoes. A heavy lasagne you'd want tins.   I can't remember the last time I had a ready meal, as in one you stick in the microwave. Too expensive and generally really not that nice. There are a lot of quick meals I will make, something like an omelette takes about 3 minutes. Noodle soup, something like a ramen - both can just use any veggies you have or leftovers. If I have time I cook things in batches and have them in the freezer as a ""ready meal"" that just needs microwaving. If I am not cooking from scratch I would rather have a takeaway to be honest.   This got me thinking:   imagine cooking beans on high heat for hours every time you wanted them   You wouldn't need do that though, you can cook up a huge batch of beans then freeze them down in batches. Dried beans are cheaper, you get mountains out of a single bag, and you can do them in a slow cooker or on a very low heat - it could easily cost less than buying a tin each time. I do it with black beans / turtle beans as they are harder to find."

I don't eat ready meals any more - in the last 10 years, the only exception was when I was having my kitchen renovated and I only had a microwave to cook things with. I often cook in quantity and freeze portions for later so for me a 'ready meal' is a previously made portion of chilli or bolognese defrosted on the night I want to use it.

Supermarkets mean that living by seasonal food is a luxury for people who want it, normally people get food from the supermarket where everything is shipped or flown in from wherever it is in season. E.g. asparagus often from Peru, samphire from Israel, etc etc. To look for a situation where food must be had seasonally, preserved or not at all, you must go back 50 years. That is why no-one really responded to that part of your question.  Cooking costs relatively little. The energy company gave me a smart meter, so I can say it costs about 30 US cents (I am actually in the UK) to roast a joint for 3 people, that is 1+ hour of the oven on. And boiling food will be cheaper.  Like many people, I use cans or stuff if I am back late from work or need to eat quickly. I hate ready meals, and do not eat or buy them if I can avoid it.  Tins e.g. fish, Fray Bentos meat, can be lovely.   A lot of people eat frozen food, but I do not like that either. Peas are good frozen as well, though, saves shelling them."

As for the rest of the UK I'm struggling to picture a civil war in a country which doesn't have a well-established tradition of political activism or revolution. I mean, we haven't had major, bloody civil disorder on the mainland since the Peterloo massacre.

If you were to receive over Â£15,000 you would receive equal monthly installments with additional payments in February and July. What subject would you be doing it for?

You would be in breach of this. You also stated below that you haven't graduated, you probably don't realise quite how competitive PGCE places are. There are a limited number of spaces set by the government. It is rare for people to get onto courses having just finished university, especially if they have no relevant work experience. Having stated that you don't actually intend to teach, I doubt you have done this. I also doubt that you would be able to convince any course providers of your genuine interest. If you did manage to you would be taking the place of someone who actually wants a teaching career.   In addition to this a PGCE course will not be like your other time spent at university. You will be essentially working a full time job at a school whilst also being required to complete your usual university assignments, including essays. It is NOT easy. PGCE courses actually have an incredibly high drop out rate for this reason, people think it is a doss option, which just isn't the case.   Not to mention during your time doing a PGCE (if you got onto one) you would be teaching children. Would it be fair on those students to have someone who is completely uncommitted to them?

One of the major issues in teaching is that there are consistently high numbers leaving the profession. Something like 40% leave within the first two years of completing their PGCE. This is detrimental to the students because it means there is a lack of experienced staff. Going into teaching with the plan to leave in a couple of years once you've got your bursary contributes this. It is also money that could have otherwise gone into other funds for education.  I think the issue comes down to how long you would plan to teach for? Five years would be reasonable. Honestly, my advice would be don't go into teaching unless you have a genuine passion and interest in it, because the chances are you won't last.

It'll save you time and hassle in the long run, and give you a sense of ownership in your new life. Passports don't have your address on. Driving licence address changes are free I believe.

AskUK,3dt9ql,motifsky,2,Sun Jul 19 06:42:35 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea to change at least the 'official' stuff (bank, driving licence, etc) because they're useful for identification/paperwork purposes & it can look weird if addresses don't match up. If you're on JSA, definitely change that address, because they send stuff at the last minute by the slowest possible post, so by the time your parents send stuff on to you, you might have missed an appointment.  Maybe skip anything trivial (catalogue mailing lists, etc) until you're settled in your new place & have some idea how long you'll stay, but change the important stuff."
AskUK,3dt9ql,pinebarren,2,Sun Jul 19 08:36:49 2015 UTC,"Technically yes you should. When I moved out I left all my addresses as there family home. In hindsight I should have changed them.

As you said provisional driving license I take it you don't have a car yet? When or if you do mate sure that everything is registered to wherever you live as insurance can be invalidated if the car actually resides at a household that isn't listed on the documents.

AskUK,3dtgaw,Duffindore,9,Sun Jul 19 07:55:33 2015 UTC,You're not living in your own for 1K anywhere you'd want to live. For a professional job you'd likely be paid monthly. Banks easy to set up an you'll get a debit card. They will want ID and address proof (a bill or tenancy agreement).
AskUK,3dtgaw,Bacchus87,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:40:20 2015 UTC,Where is the catch with offers like this? A studio for 1k a month in z2:  http://www.rightmove.co.uk/s6p/35022441. I'm probably missing something obvious here.

AskUK,3dtgaw,explax,5,Sun Jul 19 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to live in London for Â£1k a month, but if you can stomach commuting, I live 45 mins away by mainline train, and my studio cost me around Â£450/mo (plus all bills etc, so probably looking Â£550-650 all in); this was a few years ago, so probably add a couple of hundred to that. An annual mainline train ticket is, I believe, around Â£4000. If you want to live within the Z, then you're probably looking at Z6, then again probably more expensive. I'd recommend looking at sites like rightmove, which will let you tailor your expectations. If you find an area that seems to suit, it wouldn't hurt to post back to here to make sure it's not a deceptively scummy area. Living in a shared place would certainly be cheaper, but I've no experience of it so can't say any more really.  There is wifi across the underground, but only really in stations.  For banks, I recommend Santander; the 321 account is good value. They do have a somewhat poor reputation for customer service though; I've not had to use them so I can't give firsthand experience for that. I wouldn't expect getting a debit card would be an issue with zero credit rating, but I wouldn't expect to get a credit card or loan at a reasonable rate for a few years.  Wages for professional jobs are typically paid monthly. This will usually be either last working day of the month, the last friday, or some other nice, predictable date. Setting up your bills to come out ASAP after that is always a good idea.  You say your net income is expected to be around Â£3k; are you sure of that? Over here, tax is deducted from your pay without you ever seeing it. Here's some information on income tax, but there are other deductions you can expect, such as National Insurance (back in the day this went to pay for the NHS etc, but now just goes into the pot with everything else) and pension contributions."

You can't get mobile coverage on the 'underground' sections of the underground. Three is probably a good bet but make sure you shop around.  Water bills for the most part are fixed, unless you have a water meter which are pretty uncommon in my experience. You will need to lower your expectations, Â£1000pcm wont buy you an awful lot im afraid. Look at rightmove for rentals and spareroom for house/flatshares."

AskUK,3dtgaw,Ryukai,2,Sun Jul 19 08:10:43 2015 UTC,It's also free for Virgin Mobile or TV customers.
AskUK,3dtgaw,oblong89334,2,Sun Jul 19 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"1) I can't recommend any banks as I've only been with HSBC my whole life on a fairly basic account.   As far as I know, all current accounts give you a debit card in the UK. I don't know anyone who doesn't have one.  Banks usually want ID and proof of address when you're setting up an account with them - not sure about how you'd get the second one sorted being from abroad. Hopefully someone who has done something similar can shed some more light on that for you.  2) I use O2 and live in London. I wouldn't bother with them as the signal is shoddy despite this being a major city. My girlfriend is on EE and she always has full signal and 4G, but the highest data allowance they offer is 20GB so if you're after unlimited data then Three is your only option as far as I know.  There's no mobile signal at all on the Underground but there is free wifi provided by Virgin which you can get access to through being a customer of various other companies (EE for example). I've found it's fairly worthless unless you're waiting on a platform and doesn't work at all when the trains are moving. My advice would be to stock up your phone/tablet with games/books/movies and stuff that doesn't need an internet connection to be used for when you're travelling on the Tube.  3) At a conservative estimate I would say as you're planning on living alone that your gas & electricity will be about Â£50/month. That's roughly what I pay with two of us in a 1 bed flat. Water is a set amount every 6 months (at least it is where I am) and is around Â£140 for that time. You'll also have to pay council tax which is dependent on where you live and the type of property you're in. You can find out more about that here.  In terms of Â£1k being enough, put Zone 1 right out of your mind. Stupid prices. Zone 2 you might be OK to get a studio somewhere but it won't be the nicest. Zone 3 is probably your best bet. Whereabouts are you going to be working? Best to base where you want to leave on ease of access to public transport. I'd recommend trying to live as near to a Tube station as possible as it's such a massive convenience. I can give you some advice on where to live if you let me know a rough idea of where you'll be working and what sort of area you're looking for.  Sharing is also a good option and will save you a lot of money. I haven't done it personally so can't speak from experience but you'll be much better of financially because the rent is cheaper and you'll be splitting bills.  4) Wages are almost always paid monthly. I also work in IT and mine are paid on the last Friday of the month, but the actual day depends on the company."

Well on the scene I saw a paramedic because my shoulder blade and back was having a kinda of dull numb pain which wasn't there before but I thought they wouldn't take me seriously with it.
AskUK,3du45y,moremattymattmatt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"You can claim for any uninsured financial loss off the third party. You can't claim for inconvenience but if, for example, you had to pay extra for a taxi to get you to work then you can claim. Basically keep receipts for everything that might be relevant until your claim is settled.  ISTR that if you've got legal protection cover on your policy then you can make the claim through your insurance company rather than dealing with the 3rd party directly."

AskUK,3dqhsa,mediocrity511,7,Sat Jul 18 14:27:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, there's something unnerving about not being able to read facial cues. At my uni (I studied modern languages) the teacher had the right to request them to remove the face covering as it interfered with teaching, I'm not sure how much they could enforce it but I found it quite interesting as communication is about more than what you say its how you say it, lip reading  all that kind of thing"

(since some of the kids round here wear turban-like hair coverings but other families only seem to wear them as adults) and ""have you ever cut your hair?"" but I can't go up to strangers and ask that. Also, the Sikh women I know cut their hair; are there different rules for men and women re: hair cutting, or is it that some people have decided it's okay to cut hair (similar to how some Muslims don't interpret the teachings as requiring headscarves)? I also wonder whether the turbans are comfortable to wear, or whether they get hot or start tugging on your hair?  I don't usually find them sexy, but I don't find most hats sexy. They're not supposed to be sexy, they're supposed to serve a religious purpose."

I don't know if there's an actual age or coming of age ceremony when they start wearing the full turban. A lad I knew just turned up one day wearing the full fat version when we were about 13.  By the letter, no Sikh, male or female is meant to cut their hair IIRC but much like modern Christians, Muslims etc these rules bend, especially in western society.

Personally I think turbans are pretty cool but never put much thought into it tbh, certainly not uncomfortable when I see one though.   However, a lot of people in my work are very racist and I hate hate hate it. The other day I was part of a conversation where several people said they would refuse to get in a taxi if the driver was wearing a turban or non-white (they used racial slurs for that). I told them I thought they were wrong but they are all senior to me in work and we work very close together, so arguing too much or telling them to stop being racist scum would make work so uncomfortable. I've considered reporting them (for more than just this occasion too) but it feels like I am the only one with the opinion that racism is wrong and if it came down to it, it would be the word of a 10 year+ manager against a 2 year admin (me). So I don't know what I can do :( I don't intend to work there much longer though.  But I guess that's the brutal honest other side of this that you might have expected. Hope I've not offended anyone."

The laws that people are complaining about are either completely valid (don't park within 15 feet of a fire hydrant because it would block firetrucks in an emergency) or nearly non-existent (""don't back into this parking space""). Jaywalking is also illegal (but almost never enforced) to keep the roads clear - I can't imagine why anyone would want it to be legal to walk in/across the street whenever you want.

If you're walking somewhere that's got well designed pedestrian infrastructure then you might never feel the need to cross the road away from a designated crossing. On the other hand, some places that have jaywalking laws seem to have them as part of a deliberate pro-car / anti-pedestrian policy. In The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson, the author rants (hilariously) about how he can't walk between adjacent shops in America (due to blocking walls) and is expected to visit a shop, get back in his car and drive next-door to the next shop.

AskUK,3dq2iw,GrandDeluge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:23:17 2015 UTC,It's funny because in NYC the people that I assume were the locals would cross in the time between the traffic light going red and the little man going green. It made it easier to differentiate the tourists.
AskUK,3dq2iw,The_Sponge_Of_Wrath,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:12:52 2015 UTC,I tend to do this in any country I'm in. Light's gone red for the cars? Time for the head-start on the slowpokes!
AskUK,3dq2iw,benscookie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"There is a law in the US for jaywalking. My friend got a ticket because he crossed at the crossing when the pedestrian light was already blinking and if I was not wrong, the police considered it jaywalking (I may remember wrongly). The police was seen very often ""camping"" at that intersection because it is near a college with heavy foot traffic."
AskUK,3dq2iw,Elanthius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:41:22 2015 UTC,This is the first time anyone has explained to me what jaywalking actually is. I've always thought it was stopping in the middle of the lanes while cars go past.

As a Brit, I cannot take it seriously at all, but I used to get away with it because the police could not speak English.  The one policeman who really made a fuss about it happened to speak perfect English and, despite my protestations that I couldn't understand him, simply said to me ""You know that my English is perfect, so don't try to kid me"".  i didn't jaywalk after that.  /For about a day.  Fuck that, I got places to go..."
AskUK,3dq2iw,arowberry,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"Crossing a street in Melbourne and I could see the police cars lights go on. Decided to pretend I hadn't notice and went into the 7-11, brought what I wanted and left the store. Police were waiting outside. They didn't ticket me after finding out I was from the UK.  Living in Canada these days, jaywalk on a regular basis; never caused me any problems."
AskUK,3dq2iw,forgottenoldusername,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Someone shook their head at me for doing in in Canada, not sure why, nothing was coming and it seemed as if no one gave a shit about the law anyway.  Funnily enough I work in a touristy area of the UK and American tourists are absolutely terrible for just walking into the road with no regard. You'd think they'd be extra careful seeing as they're used to the jaywalking laws..."

AskUK,3dryph,ViridianPanther,3,Sun Jul 19 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"OK, so enter your departure date and time, origin and destinations, and select ""Return"". Then put in the time and date you want to leave Leicester. (If you don't know when you'll be coming back, tick ""Open Return"" instead.)  The National Express site will then sell you the right combination of tickets. If you get stuck, call them and ask."
AskUK,3dryph,ViridianPanther,5,Sat Jul 18 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Well, you're making a return journey, presumably? Going to Leicester and then coming back?  So click the ""return"" button on the journey planner.  Whether or not it actually sells you a ticket that says 'return' on it, or sells you two singles (one from London to Leicester, one from Leicester to London) is another matter.  EDIT: since I don't think you understand this properly: a ""single"" journey is what the Americans would call ""one way."""

AskUK,3dqmut,brianbedonde,8,Sat Jul 18 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, it is legal on both trains and buses, except in London (TfL bylaw).   Any restrictions are probably private operator rules.  https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/media/314290/alcohol%20and%20the%20law%20pdf.pdf"
AskUK,3dqmut,Skuld,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. 'No alcohol' on buses is as enforceable as 'no smelly food'. Bus operators don't have anything to lose by having a no-alcohol rule. Train companies have alcohol sales, and also longer journies, ones when people might want to bring their own drinks.  There's plenty of options available to deal with drunken dickheads, be it refusing them travel, requiring them to leave, or having the police deal with them."
AskUK,3dqmut,vln,5,Sun Jul 19 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"It's very much intended, especially on long distance services where alcohol is sold on-board. The Licensing Act even has an exemption to allow those sales to be made without a licence.   However the Railway Byelaws make it an offence to remain on the railway when unfit or to carry alcohol on an advertised ""dry train"". This does not apply to Merseyrail or TfL services which have slightly different byelaws that prohibit drinking or carrying open containers."
AskUK,3dqmut,cool110110,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Merseyrail is much improved from their banning of alcohol, mainly because of not having to put up with those who have been to the races and are pie eyed."
AskUK,3dqmut,40sleeps,-7,Sun Jul 19 08:59:43 2015 UTC,"It's just TfL being dicks. Instead of clamping down on the tiny number of people who get drunk and then behave badly, they decided to just ban drinking on all their services.  Other train operators don't mind people drinking."
AskUK,3dqmut,DrHydeous,3,Sat Jul 18 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Not really. Normal people can go the length of the train journey without drinking, while asshats are prohibited. Should be implemented across all rail networks imo."
AskUK,3dqmut,vote_me_down,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"I've always thought this. If you can't make it the length of a train journey without having a drink, you've probably got a problem."
AskUK,3dqmut,wildhaggis,0,Sun Jul 19 07:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, normal people can go the length of the journey without drinking, but why should they have to if they don't want to? Normal people drinking don't cause any problems for others."
AskUK,3dqmut,DrHydeous,0,Sat Jul 18 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"Because it enables those who can't handle their drink. And, most people cause some problem when they drink, even if it's just that they're a little louder or more boisterous."
AskUK,3dqmut,vote_me_down,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:09:50 2015 UTC,Okay let's ban pubs.
AskUK,3dqmut,Perihelion_,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"I believe the social and health problems caused by alcohol outweigh the positives, so banning a place specifically designed for drinking, where limits and control can be implemented, seems counter-productive."
AskUK,3dqmut,vote_me_down,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:39:45 2015 UTC,CD players enable those who can't keep the damned volume down at night.  Therefore we should immediately ban CD players!

AskUK,3dqmut,vote_me_down,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:35:33 2015 UTC,Fallacy: complete bollocks  Most people who have a drink just ... have a drink. Being a little bit louder or boisterous isn't a problem unless you're the sort of po-faced twat who thinks anything you don't enjoy yourself should be outlawed.
AskUK,3dqmut,DrHydeous,0,Sun Jul 19 12:32:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for making my argument for me.
AskUK,3dqmut,vote_me_down,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:01:20 2015 UTC,You appear to be confused. Have you had too much to drink?
AskUK,3dqmut,DrHydeous,4,Sun Jul 19 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but if people want to downvote me because they think I'm putting meaning into ""normal people"", then that's more comical to me.  But, I suspect it's because I'm in favour of a ban on drinking on trains. Unpopular opinion = downvotes."

AskUK,3dqjxl,Buxxbaum,3,Sat Jul 18 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"From the current tax year on, Class 2 NICs will be paid through self assessment along with income tax and Class 4 NICs. The same exemption for small earnings exists, but you no longer need to claim the exemption in advance because self assessment will decide whether you need to pay it based on actual earnings."
AskUK,3dqjxl,stevemegson,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:56 2015 UTC,But she received an invoice for Â£150 for the 31st of this month for the tax year 2014/2015.  She earned way below the treshhold. So just ignore it till she did her tax declaration for last tax year?
AskUK,3dqjxl,stevemegson,3,Sat Jul 18 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"The SEE certificate still existed for 2014/15, so the preferred solution would have been to apply for that in advance. Without the certificate you can still apply for a refund of overpaid contributions, so the worst case would be paying the money now and then immediately claiming a refund. If she sends a letter explaining that she's eligible to claim a refund, hopefully they'll be able to just cancel the bill without her being pointlessly out of pocket for a while."
AskUK,3dqjxl,stevemegson,2,Sat Jul 18 15:39:29 2015 UTC,Ah. Problem is she does not have the money to pay it. As she only earned Â£500 so far this year. And I neither as I need to pay a council tax bill and electricity/gas.  So what can she do about it?

AskUK,3dnhqo,bacon_cake,2,Sat Jul 18 11:32:09 2015 UTC,"Most of my issues have been with social housing so it was always one of two companies. Once I didn't know for sure but I did remember which estate agents sign was outside the house when it was for sale so I emailed the estate agents and asked if they acted as an agent, they didn't but they sent me the landlords details.   Otherwise I believe you can pay the land registry to tell you.   Good luck."
AskUK,3dnhqo,dweebgal,3,Sat Jul 18 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"Daft question perhaps, but how long have you been living there?  I ask because someone near me has this dog that NEVER shuts up, and when he starts it often starts off other dogs too.  However, I've been here 2 years now, and I honestly don't notice it now, even in the summer when we have the windows open a lot.  If you really can't deal with it though, council is the way to go."
AskUK,3dnhqo,dweebgal,3,Fri Jul 17 22:48:41 2015 UTC,I've been living here all my life. The dog is new in the last few months.  Do you live in a noisy urban area? I live on the very edge of town (behind our house is farmland) and even a car going past is something you can't ignore because it happens so infrequently. A dog barking all the time drives you crazy.
AskUK,3dnhqo,tmstms,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"Not particularly, I mean, I'm not far from town, but there's a huge park opposite us so it's pretty quiet, not hugely built up. I did move from somewhere that was quiet before though.   I see your point about being in a quiet area, just thinking it might be a self solving problem if it's something you're not used to.

AskUK,3dnhqo,ckkingpin,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"OP, can you see the dog and/or the area it's kept in?  You can't report the owner to the RSPCA for barking alone, but if they're not meeting the criteria for keeping a dog outside you can report it as a welfare issue. Especially if the animal looks malnourished (can you see its ribs/vertebrae/hips from a distance?) or hurt, or if there's little sign of faeces being cleared out of the garden on a regular basis."

As someone said, you need to keep a diary of incidents for at least 8 weeks (my last council) before they will even send a letter.  It's normally pretty tortuous.  On the plus side, it's surprising what you end up filtering out.  My neighbour has a couple of giant turkey who gobble at the smallest sound (yes, yes, I know... gobble!) and I don't really notice it any more.  Last week an electrician nearly fainted when it happened.  Out of interest, do you know why the dog barks?  Does it get left alone all day?

The next day the shop owner brought in a different replacement dog, which still barked but slightly less. We were worried about the conditions because this second dog didn't look too healthy and had recently had puppies and killed them which is a sign of stress. The Rspca came and checked over and said the dog was just about in good condition. The shopkeeper lied about her care as soon as the officials said there was a fine if she wasn't cared for during the shop hours as part of their legal responsibility.  We as neighbours are taking her out for walks when we can and socialising her becsuse she primarily barks from loneliness and it's gotten better. Looking for a new home for her at the sake time is difficult because she is giant.   The most effective way to get them to change their attitude is that we didn't let them know it was us that put in the environment health or rspca.  There are lots of neighbours, it could have been anybody. That's why they allow is access to play and walk the dog and discreetly check on her"

AskUK,3dnmei,jimmysixtoes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"No idea about ones in that area, but have some general advice. My experience with selling is that the massive ones are not necessarily the best - people expect to pay very little and your stall can get lost in the expanse of it. Small ones (things like one offs in a school playground) you can get more for your items if it is in decent condition, but expect to take a lot home. The area it is in is an issue also, swankier areas have more cash floating about, a bit of a stereotype but it seemed to be mainly true. Try and sell as much as you can on facebook groups or ebay first of all, especially things like DVDs or items in original boxes. Have a look at completed items for an idea of price. At the end of the car boot sale, just get rid of the leftovers for anything - 50p, 10p, whatever. You might think you will do another car boot or find a home for it but it will just sit in a box forever."
AskUK,3dmxbk,Anoalir,5,Fri Jul 17 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"If it's anything like applying for a passport then they want someone in a long list of professions or someone of similar standing in the community. Given that their list of professions includes priests, MPs, and journalists, three of the least trustworthy professions out there, it basically means ""anyone who hasn't yet been convicted of genocide while fucking an underage cat"" :-)  More seriously, for a passport the counter-signatory doesn't have to be someone who has one of those jobs, just someone that will be seen as trustworthy and who can be easily contacted in the unlikely event that they actually check up on it. Someone who has retired is fine. Someone who is involved in some ""civic society"" body is fine - eg the WI, or the local bird-watching society, or a local football club, or ...  And try your school anyway. So what if you left three years ago? I left school 23 years ago, and when I rocked up at my old school a few months back for a fund-raising thing, I went to the desk to get my name badge and the teacher doing that just handed it to me straight away and said ""hello David, nice to see you again"", before I'd even had a chance to open my mouth and tell him who I was.

I'd suggest looking at sites like gumtree and spareroom.co.uk as you're more likely to deal directly with the landlord. I'm really not a fan of estate agents and will choose to avoid dealing with them when at all possible.

AskUK,3dmdqb,slippyg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:35:59 2015 UTC,If you rent directly from a Landlord you're likely to not have to pay any/many 'fees' but you run the risk of the landlord being completely incompetent regarding his legal responsibilities.  If you rent from an agent you're likely to have to pay quite a bit more in 'fees' but if it's a well known high street agent you would assume that they know what they're doing. Agents might be money grabbing but a great deal will be well versed in the law.  I'd want to rent directly from a landlord that had many properties so at least you know he's doing it professionally. Rather than someone who thought a buy to let sounded like a great idea because he read about it in a newspaper.
AskUK,3dmdqb,slippyg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"If you rent through an agent, do the additional fees only occur at the start of your letting arrangement, or are they an on going expense?"

Now is the perfect time to look. you may also have luck on spareroom as the user before me suggested. Try to deal through an estate agent as opposed to a landlord directly, and make sure you see the property first if possible  in a house share if you are stuck with annoying, dirty, loud flatmates could be difficult but most people, particularly professionals, aren't like this (although some may not be as clean as you'd like!)  Flat share will be cheaper, especially in regards to bills and often as you said you can get bills included for the same price as the 1 bed flat without bills."
AskUK,3dmdqb,Esco91,2,Fri Jul 17 13:54:03 2015 UTC,Why deal through an estate agent? They've been nothing but expensive trouble in my experiance. I've always done better going directly to the landlord. Cut out the man in the middle.
AskUK,3dmdqb,DarkDarkness,5,Fri Jul 17 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"Why deal through an estate agent? They've been nothing but expensive trouble in my experiance   Because landlords are a lot more picky. If you go to an estate agents or letting agents they only care about getting paid, whereas letting agents let other ideologies shine through. I've been on both ends of this - ""sorry, I'd rather take a young family than 4 21 year old male students"" and ""well I'd actually promised it to a nice young girl who is a Masters student but I think you (a 28 year old guy and a 26 year old lass in full time employment, lived together before) would be a better fit"".

AskUK,3dmdqb,j1mb0b,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"Go with a lettings agent and not an estate agent. Estate agents tend to sell houses with rental on the side.   I wouldn't necessarily avoid them completely but caveat emptor. If you don't go through an agent, remember that if you have a problem (eg flooding, no electrics, cooker breaks, you break your key in the door etc etc) you'll need to go through the landlord to get it fixed. Now all landlords are not the same, but they'll all obviously be in the business of maximising profit by minimising cost. So depending on the landlord, you could end up with a problem that you're expected to live with while the landlord faffs around to find a cheap answer. Or worse, simply ignores it.  Very broadly speaking, you won't have that problem with an agent. The agent will know about the tenancy deposit scheme, the gas safety certificate and will be keen to stay within the law. Depending on the company, they will also be worried about complaints to their head-office.  Like I say, it's most definitely not ""Agents = good, landlords = bad"" but speaking as a landlord myself, the above is something to bear in mind."

AskUK,3dmk77,Esco91,9,Sat Jul 18 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"Avoid doing the stuff you have to pay for in London, you can do that kind of thing in York or Edinburgh cheaper, but London has tonnes more museums (free) and events.  For example don't bother with the London Dungeon, it costs Â£25 and queues in high summer are like 90 minutes long. Instead go to York Dungeon, the same idea by the same company, with better sketches (cos most of the tourists are British, Scandinavian or American and can understand better English) but for Â£15 and you'll only be waiting 20 mins or so. All the 'privately owned museum experience' type things in London are overpriced and have long queues in summer (especially when it rains), but anything that's a publicly owned museum is free and all the historic buildings that are English Heritage are usually reasonably priced (there are exceptions, ahem Stonehenge)  In London check out Camden Market/Locks, that's the place to pick up all the standard souvenirs but at a reasonable price, plus that small area is probably about the most diverse place in Western Europe, possibly the world, when it comes to street food. Also regarding food in London (and all over the UK tbh), when your wallet starts to sweat after a few days but you need a cheap meal out, Wetherspoons is a pretty good bet.  Also I assume as you're Danish you are beer drinkers - tours of York Brewery are cheap and well worth it. For most Brits these days York has a very strong drinking and pub tradition, so thats a good way to get involved without getting hammered drunk. Jorvik Centre is a Must-Do for Danes as well, I'd say.  Finally I would suggest a visit to nearby Knaresborough while you are in York. You'll get some beautiful nature of the classic English variety, and then there is Mother Shiptons cave which is pretty cool. If you really want to see cool historic stuff, you might also make a visit to Leeds purely for the Royal Armories They also have a smaller RA in the Tower of London, but then you have to have paid for the ToL."

If you have time to drive in the countryside,probably the Trossachs are the closest taste of the Highlands.  As others are saying, you will be travelling down the East side of the country which was in  its time heavily raided and influenced by Vikings, especially Danish ones, and was indeed called the Danelaw.  Yes, on the way down, Durham is lovely, and before that, right by the A1, there is Holy Island (once raided by Vikings, of course), reached by a causeway - some nice castles around there- Bamburgh, Alnwick. Just after you pass Newcastle, you see the Angel of the North on the roadside (on the left, but you only get a good view if you turn off and park beside it.)  further south, Yorkshire Dales are nice if you have time, especially Swaledale and Wensleydale. You can have a good tea with cheese in the Creamery at Hawes in Wensleydale. York itself has the famous Viking museum as well as York Minster.

All the companies try and sell you a package of Internet + phone + TV services. It may be that if you already have a phone connectd with a particular provider, that provider will therefore work out cheapest - since you always have to pay line rental.

AskUK,3dnj8a,Trowsyrs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"Their return policy (I imagine, without looking at it) will be for returning an item unused and unopened. Then you'd get a full refund, no questions asked. If theres something wrong with it(which you would have to claim is the case with performance - though 'slow as shit' is quite subjective), you've got around 6 months to return it as a defect in the product which renders it not fit for purpose. After that period, that argument is really hard to make. But returning in those circumstances only entitles you to a repair first, then a replacement if the repair is inadequate. It doesn't entitle you to an upgrade, which is what the new model is, despite being the same price. EU law does allow for a longer warranty on products, increasing the length for electronic goods specifically, but that won't help you here in getting the new device.   In my opinion, you could raise the speed issue with them and they'll have a look at it, but you'll get the same device back, or you could try an exchange where the value of your device is discounted from the new model (but you obviously pay a contribution towards the new model). Apple is all about it's own image and being consumer friendly. I'd be surprised if they played hardball with you and refused an exchange or some sort of discount on an upgrade, but they don't just give products away either so you wouldn't get the full value of your current device back. You literally have nothing to lose in trying to exchange."

AskUK,3djm5n,windywoops,12,Thu Jul 16 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"The train-station thing was a very smart business move, in the early days of the railways.  I can't believe that's the only profitable part of the business, though. If it was, they'd have spun it off into a seperate enterprise, and let the loss-making high street stuff fall into the hands of asset-strippers.  I also find it hard to see how having post offices based in the stores makes up for the massive overheads?"
AskUK,3djm5n,vln,17,Thu Jul 16 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"So this is pretty much spot on. Smiths was in dire financial difficulties a couple of years ago and adopted a completely new strategy. Firstly they reviewed their locations and recognised that stations and airports (areas with high footfall) were prime locations along with some high street stores. They then assessed the cost basis of each store and to cut a long story short identified myriad stores that needed to go immediately and others that will go when their leases come up. Largely the ones that are going are high street and the ones that will remain are airports and such. They are essentially embracing the books to read on the train/holiday, travel essentials you may have forgotten, snacks, cigarettes and newspaper angle. Those massive bargain basement Smiths are slowly being phased out, and in many ways replaced by the works (seriously, who shops in there?).   As for the post office thing, it's basically a way of sharing your rent/rates over two businesses in prime locations."

If you're not into modern board games then most of the games you're familiar with will probably be American style - Monopoly, Risk etc.  Euro games tend to be much less luck driven, the theme tends to be a bit bland (farming, trading in the Mediterranean etc) and conflict tends to be indirect e.g. taking the resource your opponent needed before they could, rather than attacking them straight out.  These kind of games (and the community) developed mostly in Germany which is why they get called German style or Euro games. It's sort of losing it's meaning now as in modern gaming  both styles are blending together and most games exist somewhere on a spectrum.  Come checkout /r/boardgames if you'd like to know more."

There was literally no-one up there except me. Not even someone on the till. At one point I was questioning whether the upstairs was closed and I hadn't noticed the signs.  Went to look at books in the ""transport and history"" section because I'm interested in aircraft. Got faced with a load of Tom Clancy rip-offs. Surely ""transport and history"" section would suggest non-fiction!?  Even when I paid using the automated cashier, why is it that they have to ask if I want promotional items? If I wanted a bottle of water I'd have bought a bottle of fucking water. Then they want to charge me (1p, admittedly) to take a plastic bag!? Everywhere else just gives the damn things away.

Birth certificate? Proof of vaccines? Transcripts from previous schooling?   We had to take an entrance exam with a follow-up interview to get in.  Presumably school reports had to be seen as well, though I don't know.   Would a P.O. box number be acceptable as a mailing address?   I would guess almost certainly not, not least as there would be ""off"" weekends when pupils went home.  The school would have been shut and no pupils were allowed on site.   Handing out a fake phone number would be very tricky, could my characters' parents just explain that no phone number is available, or call the school every day from a payphone until they get lucky, the school was just about to contact them, or arrange for face to face meetings only?   If they're paying hundreds of pounds a term, it's very unlikely they wouldn't have a home phone.  I'm sure even back then it would have looked dodgy.   Would the school accept a cash payment for the entire year?   Maybe.  My parents paid termly as per the school's invoices and a cheque.  Cash might be seen as dodgy.   My characters' parents are looking for an all girls school in Surrey, what might tuition look like for that time and place?

At least Aussies be quiet if you ask them to. You know who else were loud? Students! All of them. From everywhere. USA, Oz, London, Manchester, Wales, France, Italy, Canada, ...Surrey (My flatmate was from Surrey and she was one of the loudest people I've ever met lol)... it does not matter.  Yes, many Americans are loud. You basically have to be loud in the States. It's a loud place. But, DrHydeous, to say ALL Americans are loud just because the Americans you've personally met have been loud is a huge over-generalisation. For one thing, I will say perhaps some of the people others hear as Americans are actually Canadians. I find some Canadians often even louder, more arrogant, and more obnoxious than Americans, believe it or not. And, you know, there are all sorts of people. Some are loud, some are not. I know a great many Americans who are soft-spoken, shy, and/or unintrusive. Like theactorkevineldon said, it's very likely you would never have noticed them in a crowd.

All that said, clearly you haven't spent much time around British youth when they're travelling if you want to talk about loud... Put them out in the sunshine and suddenly they're basically intolerable, drunken louts. (This also applies to many middle-aged English men on holidays in warm destinations as well.)  In fairness though, I have to say when I visited Iceland the first time, the American family in the airport were by far the worst I've ever heard, complete with a massive domestic argument and horrible yelling children. It was like an episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey meets Jeremy Kyle. But then the flight back from Ireland, I was surrounded on all sides by my fellow countrymen (Canadians) and I wanted to shoot myself in the face they were SO loud, SO officious, and SO obnoxious.

I think this stems from the lack of a long-lasting culture in America.  The U.S. is such a new country with an assortment of people that many will look for a larger identity when trying to discover their own roots.  Hearing how my great-great grandpa came over from Czechoslovakia was something very intriguing and helped me identify my own family history.  Obviously, I'm not going to go into the Czech Republic or Slovakia and claim to be ""one of them,"" but I do definitely see why Americans say these sorts of things.  We really look up to our ancestral homelands since we find it interesting to see where we may have been born if our ancestors never left.  HOWEVER, I do see how hearing such comments from tourists can seem odd or annoying, and I'll definitely refrain from saying these sorts of things.   don't complain about things not be like they are in America, don't assume that things work the same, and don't assume that our cultures are the same.   That seems to be a big problem with U.S. society.

For example a friend of mine took a load of business studies classes in ""Royal Windsor"", which may people may expect to be a largely ""white"" town. I believe she was the only white person in any of her classes, the student body heavily leaning to Indian/Pakistani decent and a lot of West Indies or African decent.  There are spots in North London that are heavily Jewish, there are spots in West London that have some bi-lingual signs (English/Punjabi) because the percentage of people of Pakistani & Indian decent is so high.

The Republic of Ireland is not part of the UK. It was, but religious and political unrest led to violence and they seceded in 1922. Northern Ireland is part of the UK, and is predominantly protestant, where the Republic of Ireland is mostly catholic.   There was a period in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1998 known as the troubles which consisted of religiously fueled political violence between those who wanted a united Ireland (mostly catholic) and those who wanted to stay in the UK (mostly protestant).   There were a few thousand deaths, and tens of thousands of injuries. There was also a number of terrorist attacks by the unionist Irish in the UK (such as a mortar attack on downing Street, bombings in UK cities and massacres, aimed at civilians), and some atrocities committed by British forces and paramilitary forces on both sides. Often this fighting spilled into the Republic of Ireland, and the RoI supported the unionists.   The Good Friday Agreement ended the fighting, and set up a fairer governance over Northern Ireland.  Anglo-Irish relations now are fairly good, however things can sometimes be a little tense. Obviously it hasn't been long, and it is still fresh in some people's minds. There is also very major religious segregation in Belfast."

They might check up on you one more time once the meal has been served, but that's about it except to give you the bill. Only the fanciest of fancy restaurants will have servers that will talk you through the whole menu and what's good etc.  I had an interesting experience in a restaurant in the US where the waitress (bless her heart), kept coming to the table to check on us even before we had gotten our first dish. I know tipping is a significant part of most servers' wages so I understand the need to go ""above and beyond"", but that's not really the case in the UK.

I'll reiterate what I think are the main points and include anything that may have been missed:   Be polite, yeah it's a trope that British people are always apologising for no good reason and say please and thanks for everything. I'm sorry, but it's true though. It's appreciated. We queue for things a lot, buses, icecream, etc. Join in the queue, make small talk with the people you're with. It's cool. Pubs/bars. There is an order of service at the bar of who has been waiting longest. It's rare to stay at the bar with your drink after ordering (see that a lot in US TV, don't know if that's actually a thing). You can't smoke inside a public building. This means, pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, etc. It's illegal and you will be asked, perhaps not very politely, to stop and/or fined. Most places have an out-side area for smokers. Don't mess with the Queen's guard. Yeah the're used to it, but it still makes you look like an arse. Depending on how long you're here/what you're into here are some cool places you can visit from London If you're in a group of people don't block the entire pavement/road. One of the no. 1 thing that annoys the British about tourists is when they do this. The no. 2 thing is probably taking pictures across a reasonably busy road or pavement. We feel rubbish blocking your picture, but you're taking a picture in a stupid place. Please don't do it.   I think that's it. Enjoy your trip!  (EDIT: REDDIT! Why you no formatting!)"

Most things will be on show, generally you won't need to ask what whiskeys they got as you can see them.  Everything is measured. When they get the jigger out to measure shots you're not getting stiffed, you're getting what you paid for, no more no less. Having said that some places will use speed pours but they're still giving you a measured amount, there's none of this tip for a stronger drink business.  British shots are smaller than you'll be used to, 25ml or 35ml. Maybe go for a double.  The pints will probably be bigger than you're used to. I'm not sure of the exact figure but I think it's something like 20 oz instead of 18 or 16.  Tabs are possible but not common. Generally you pay as they serve you and then take it away to where you're drinking.  Beer is much more commonly drunk here than spirits. Try ale.  Most people drink in rounds. This is exactly how it works. Judging from /r/askuk this seems trip up to Americans. Join in if you want, it's okay to skip a round if you're still drinking, generally it's assumed that if someone buys you a drink you'll buy them one later - don't worry about it not being completely even by the end of the so long as you have actually bought some drinks and not just completely sponged off other people.

It's probably not helped by the fact that, taking Nevada as a random example, sales tax is not uniform even across a single state.  I mean, it could possibly be semi-automated, at the store level.

Before printing out the new shelf tags, you run the list through a program that multiplies each price by 1.081, to add that 8.1% sales tax onto the prices. Then the head office could set the national price, but each store would have the price+tax displayed as a complete unit on the shelf."

Pretty much the sort of wheel you'd see on a child trailer being towed behind a bike (although those would be a bit large).  My guess would be that the designer of this has gone for pushchair wheels as they'd be cheap and easy to get hold of.  The problem is trying to work out the fitting.

I advise you to call the airline and to ask what their policy is on damaged passports. My assumption is that they will ask you to bring another form of photo_ID such as a driver's licence if the photo in your passport is damaged.   Don't just hope to get through because you may easily be the person who is spot-checked that day.

By contrast, Kate Hoey is also Labour, but regularly rebels against the whips if it is in the interest of her constituents. She is an exemplary representative for her constituents.  Similarly, whether or not you agree with a Conservative MP's opinions has no bearing on weather or not they do a good job representing their constituency.  Our MP is now a Conservative. State school educated, went to the local university, worked a variety of ""normal jobs"" before starting his own business.

We contacted the immigration office to try and get the passport back. No dice, we just got the runaround.   Then our next door neighbour suggested contacting our MP. I didn't hold out a great deal of hope but called his constituent office anyway. I explained the situation to the woman who answered the phone. She said she's pass the info on straight away. 7am the next morning, there was a knock on the door. It was a courier with my wife's passport. Later I got a call for Mr. Ancram himself asking if everything was OK and was there anything else he could do.   That's a huge difference between the UK political system and the US.

Take a Solidworks / Inventor course and find a job as a cad technician in the mechanical engineering sector. After you have a bit of experience you can easily move to contract work which pays a minimum of Â£15/hour, sometimes 2-3 times that amount.  Im suggesting mechanical based engineering since its a broader field which requires less specialist knowledge and specific qualifications compared to Architectural, Structural, Civil (these disciplines use Microstation / Revit / AutoCAD instead).   Scaffholders:   Of all the guys on site, these ones appear to have a good balance of high pay, low entry requirements, not the toughest jobs. Granted it is one of the most dangerous jobs on site & you need to be ok with heights.   Setting out engineer   Unlike site or consultant engineers, its not uncommon to find setting out engineers who dont hold a degree, they're often former groundworkers who took a short term surveying course. Minimum requirement would be a site surveying course where you will learn how to use a total station. Back in the day you could work as a chain man (assistant) to pick up the skills but developments in the technologies have largely negated this role. You will need to be reasonably good at maths (only basic trigonometry though). Â£35,000/year minimum. Some specialist jobs pay upto 3 times that amount.   Oil Rigs / Mining / Pipeline   Any role in the fossil fuels industries pays VERY well. Granted you will be in the middle of nowhere & to get into mining / pipeline you will need to move abroad (western australia or canada are the main ones). I've heard of office cleaners in Western Aus mining towns getting Â£35k / year."

AskUK,3djoi0,candidgenie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"Oil rigs, right now? The answer is that you don't. The oil industry in the UK right now is wrecked, there are still big layoffs and salary cuts going on and 2015 will be a crap year. After that, start sending C.V.'s out to whichever areas of the industry you want into, if you're unskilled pick your poison between drilling crew and platform crew. Getting the BOSIET and MIST can apparently help too if you're trying to get into unskilled positions but they do cost about a grand and that's a lot of money to pay for training you might never get a chance to use.  edit: That said, salaries are indeed very good compared with most onshore jobs.

Office type jobs I would recommend you learn CAD. This can be applied in a number of industries, I myself work in oil and gas and young guys without degrees with less than 3-5 years experience get paid Â£30 an hour.  Another one would be learning Primavera and becoming a project planner. A lot of engineering and construction  companies take on apprentices and you'd have a leg up with a Primavera qualification. Experienced planners make Â£50 an hour easy but that's with 10 years experience.  If you would rather not work in an office then I'd recommend welding in terms of work available. There's always work for welders as far as I can tell. I mean industrial welding not small time fixing stuff welding. Like working as a welder on an oil refinery or something you'd make a decent living Â£40k annually plus, no question.   The good thing about these areas is that they're quite niche and if you could get into a specific industry and gain a few years experience you could do very well.  Good luck."

AskUK,3dj55f,stevemegson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:01:41 2015 UTC,This is the right answer.
AskUK,3dj55f,itsalllies,3,Thu Jul 16 20:02:04 2015 UTC,I don't think that's right. but I'm not sure.  I do know the difficult part is that you have to join Self-Assessment so that the Revenue can see the freelance work and once your in Self-Assessment you're filling in forms for many years to come.
AskUK,3dj55f,SeekTruthFromFacts,2,Thu Jul 16 18:54:34 2015 UTC,Not true. Joining self-assessment is easy and leaving is also easy if your circumstances change such that you don't need to do it.
AskUK,3dj55f,IxionS3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:35:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Made me do a bit more research. Turned up a Telegraph article claiming that Â£2,500 in turnover or Â£3,000 in due tax are the thresholds for entering Self-Assessment."
AskUK,3dj55f,SeekTruthFromFacts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:48:19 2015 UTC,"You do still need to work out the tax due and contact HMRC to pay it or get it added to your tax code, and if your affairs are simple filling a tax return on-line is pretty straightforward."
AskUK,3dj55f,IxionS3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:55:17 2015 UTC,"Even though HMRC tell me I don't need to do a tax return, I choose to do one anyway, simply because it's easier and more immediate feedback than writing letters or making calls. I'm well under thresholds for doing them but it's a quick way of getting the information to them.   It took me about 45 minutes to fill in this year's return, which I did before the end of April :)"
AskUK,3dj55f,fsv,2,Fri Jul 17 14:16:19 2015 UTC,You do a self assessment tax return. You fill out one bit for employment. You fill out another bit for self-employment. The website works out how much you owe. You pay it.  If you are unlucky they will ask for more info but if it looks sensible then you are fine.  Keep all self-employment records.  It is that simple. I am assuming your self-employment is as a sole trader and not as a company.
AskUK,3dj55f,Timothy_Claypole,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"On your self-assessment tax return form you can claim all work-related expenses against tax. As you already work full-time, those expenses may not be large, but you'd be able to claim some % of depreciation on your own computer, for example, or travel to and from clients, and so on.  The revenue is pretty detailed about what you can and cannot claim."
AskUK,3di51x,DrageonTR,15,Thu Jul 16 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, there is no way to reverse the decision and you will indeed have to pay for another test, and lessons to keep your skills up.   What you can do in the future however, is request that your driving instructor accompany you in the car during the test; they can act as an extra pair of eyes and might find the instructor is making bad calls, or being unfairly harsh. However there's also the downside that you'll be under more stress (potentially), and won't truly be driving independently due to you being used to receiving instructions from the instructor. It might throw you off.   I had to do a turn in the road in a tight space, an emergency stop, as well as stop in many inconvenient places (like in between gates or other obstructions). He also tried catching me on things like the STOP sign procedure, one way road positioning etc.   These are all things that you will be expected to perform competently during driving on the road, it is not unfair for the instructor to expect you to demonstrate this. The only advice I can give in this regard is to take everything slowly. Turn in the road is super easy even in a tight space, you just need to reverse, move forward, and turn a few more times than normal. Stop signs are self-explanatory, same with one-way."
AskUK,3di51x,Tailend22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:37 2015 UTC,Welp that sucks extremely hard then. Thanks for the answer however.
AskUK,3di51x,Tailend22,3,Thu Jul 16 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"It's definitely frustrating; I can sympathise as I only passed my test a few months ago. The best advice I can truly give you is to take everything slowly.   Pulling up to the curb in between obstacles for example, there's nothing wrong with taking it slowly as long as you've indicated and checked that it's safe to slow down. Move into 1st gear, pull in, check mirror for the curb.  FWIW I would try and book your test in the morning, around rush hour; they're normally a little easier as the roads are busier, and the instructor might adjust the route so you don't take any major roads."
AskUK,3di51x,Wibble201,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"Pulling up to the curb in between obstacles for example, there's nothing wrong with taking it slowly as long as you've indicated and checked that it's safe to slow down. Move into 1st gear, pull in, check mirror for the curb.   Don't do this.  Check your mirrors first then, if necessary, indicate. You only need to indicate if other road users or pedestrians would benefit from the signal. There is absolutely no need to change to first gear. Current thinking is that 'going down through the gears' causes excess wear on the gearbox and is contrary to eco friendly driving.   Source: was a driving instructor for far too long."
AskUK,3di51x,Tailend22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Huh, opposite to how I was taught! Fair enough :)  No harm in indicating if in doubt during a test though, won't get failed for it I don't think."
AskUK,3di51x,Wibble201,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, I am also taught to not indicate when there is no need to as it may confuse someone. My instructor gave me an example of indicating to overtake a bus that is standing on a bus stop which can possibly cause road confusion to others."
AskUK,3di51x,benjymous,0,Fri Jul 17 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"Then you were taught by a moron.   There is harm in doing it during a test, you are expected to observe and be aware of other road users. You give a signal IF it would be of assistance to other road users or pedestrians. If you give a signal when there is nobody around to benefit from it then, if you do it two or three times, you will pick up a minor, more than that then you will probably fail because you have proved you a) aren't being observant enough or b) don't understand when to give a signal."
AskUK,3di51x,crownsandclay,5,Fri Jul 17 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"You should probably just chalk it up to experience, and give it another go.    Best tip is there's nothing stopping you giving a running commentary during your test, so that the examiner knows exactly what you're thinking and planning on doing.  They're not allowed to respond to direct questions, other than to clarify his instructions, but you can still chat away saying ""I'd better get out of this bus lane.  That guy on my left looks like he's going to try and come into my lane"" etc.  That way if a similar situation comes up again, your examiner will know what you're trying to do.  Btw, where are you getting the Â£200/2.5 months from?  A driving test should only cost Â£25 to book, and I'd hope your instructor isn't charging you Â£175 for the use of their car! Also pretty sure there's no limit to how frequently you can take the test, either."
AskUK,3di51x,crownsandclay,3,Thu Jul 16 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"Well the test centre I am having the test at, the waiting time is usually 2.5 months or so, my previous test I had was 2nd of May. I've been doing driving lessons since November last year.  And booking a test costs 75 pounds here. Plus an hour of driving for me costs 23 pounds."
AskUK,3di51x,Possiblyreef,2,Thu Jul 16 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"You won't have to wait the whole 2.5 months though, cancellations aren't too hard to get if you try."

Might just have been my local one but it's definitely worth asking your instructor.  Mine was booked over a month away but i got one in about a week

AskUK,3di51x,MurkFRC,0,Thu Jul 16 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's a rough estimate with how much more I will have to spend for booking another test + refreshment lessons with my instructor since the waiting time for the test is usually 2.5 months.  My first test was in the morning, 8 AM on Monday, it was pouring down with rain. The examiner took me next to a building site and a school to do a manoeuvre, took me 15 minutes to do it, in the end I got nervous that he would mark me down as serious for hesitation and I rushed the end of the manoeuvre, I ended up mounting a curb for 1 second and thus failing my exam.  This exam was at 1PM so."
AskUK,3di51x,MurkFRC,5,Thu Jul 16 13:58:43 2015 UTC,bare in mind if you had done that and he'd let you pass you could realistically have driven out of there on your own. You do kinda need a degree of confidence or you're going to struggle on your own

If you're looking for localised access to other countries, I'd recommend PIA as they allow you to set your ""location"" to a very wide variety of places.  From my experience their speeds were just passable. I had no problem using Netflix etc, but certainly downloads were much, much slower than without a VPN. I'd say I was getting maybe 30-40% speed downstream, not impressive. That said, Mullvad has so far been even slower.  One big complaint I had with PIA was rather frequent disconnects (Mullvad has held the connection fairly well). I'm not sure what the cause of this was, and didn't use it long enough to find a fix. Their customer support was not very helpful, just passing it off as an ISP issue and leaving it at that."

AskUK,3dexxs,bluejackmovedagain,2,Thu Jul 16 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"It should be fine, but in an older building it will come from a tank in the attic not straight from the mains and there is no guarantee it will be as fresh as you would ideally like.

AskUK,3dexxs,crazy_greg,2,Wed Jul 15 22:02:32 2015 UTC,If you have a water tank that feeds the bathroom tap rather than a rising main then traditionally you wouldn't as open water tanks could have anything floating in them. Most new builds don't have that problem so drinking from any tap is just the same.
AskUK,3dexxs,Flamekebab,2,Wed Jul 15 22:52:29 2015 UTC,Mains water in the UK is always drinkable. Some houses connect the bathroom taps to an internal tank which may not be drinkable. The cold water tap in the kitchen is always connected to the mains and will provide drinking water.

Most people seem to naturally know what to do but if you don't it can be really hard to understand the steps you need to take just to get by in a normal world. Another sad thing is GPs (or rather the NHS) aren't too brilliant with mental health problems but don't underestimate how useful those antidepressants can be. Prozac saved my life in my 30's. Also forget about a career for now and think about jobs, any job. It will get you out in the world, interacting with other people and doing something, it will raise your self esteem. Don't aim too high at first or you will end up being disappointed. Contact larger employers in your area - factories, large stores etc. and see if they have any jobs, don't turn a job down because it doesn't fit with a dream.

It sounds like you're stuck in a rut, and only you can get out of it. If you take the first steps and keep up the momentum you can get yourself out of it.

AskUK,3dfhxa,How2999,11,Thu Jul 16 14:53:10 2015 UTC,"After 5 years as a student in a pretty expensive place:   Share accommodation If you're going to drink, pre-drink (buy alcohol beforehand and drink it, meaning you only have a couple when you're out) Shop at Aldi, Lidl, Home Bargains, Poundland, and other discount retailers. A good one for non-fresh food online is Approved Food, I got a huge crate of food for Â£40. Figure out when supermarkets reduce their prices on fresh goods (usually around 6pm in my experience) so you can get fresh food cheaper Make large batches of food and freeze it to eat through the week. If you buy meat in bulk it's usually cheaper. Apply for an HC1 certificate so you get prescriptions, dental care and so on for free (although you might not fulfil the residency requirements for this) Don't drive or take the bus when you can walk - saving money and getting healthier at the same time. 20-30 minutes' walk is really not that much. Get an 18-25 railcard. Some banks (RBS, Santander) will give you one just for having an account. With energy providers, deal with them directly (no agencies) and submit meter readings. This means you pay for what you use and nothing more. Wear thicker clothes in winter rather than putting the heating on all day. Find a private landlord rather than an agency - this should avoid you paying tenancy or agency fees when signing the lease. Learn to fix things - I fixed a washing machine, a window latch and a TV aerial in my second year in my flat and it didn't cost me a penny using manuals online. Get a savings account with a passbook that doesn't let you access your money readily. I have one with Virgin Money and to withdraw money I have to go into the branch and show the book, which means I can't take it out willy-nilly. This lets you put money aside and manage it easier."

AskUK,3dfhxa,Trallwn14,5,Wed Jul 15 23:30:49 2015 UTC,"My advice from living as a student entirely on the student maintenance loan in an expensive city: - Learn to cook from scratch. Cooking this way is much cheaper than cooking with packet sauces or buying ready-meals/take-away.   If you can, go veggie. Vegetarian eating is much MUCH cheaper than omnivore eating. Go shopping in the evening (about 5pm, but varies form shop to shop) or, even better, if they close early on a sunday afternoon go then. You can get over 2/3s discount on fresh meat, vegetables, bread that are on their sell-buy date and freeze them or cook them that day. Walk everywhere. If you're in a city this should be easy enough. I used to walk across Bath, it took about 45 mins to get to lectures but it saved a fortune in bus fees. Share a house with friends. Yeah they'll piss you off sometimes, but it's much cheaper. Use charity shops. It might feel odd, but suck up that pride when you need anything! New clothes, check. New cookery stuff, check. There's nothing wrong with it most of the time. Don't drink or drink rarely. The number of people I saw who's spent their entire student loan for the term half way through by spending Â£20 a night drinking was insane. Seriously Â£20 was about 3 weeks of food for me.   Ok now for poor man's cooking 101:  Meat Sauce: Fry discount mince, onions and garlic (either the biggest pack you can buy for bulk discounts then freeze it, or going out of date and bough at a discount) in a little oil (Asian shops are great for cheap oil and spices). Keep stirring that stuff around so it doesn't stick until all of the meat is a light brown not pink. Add tinned tomatoes and beef stock cubes (~2 tins of toms and 1 stock cube per 250g of meat). At this point if I have any I'll add dried chill as well (you can buy this super cheap in asian stores as well, I bought a pot for Â£2 and it lasted me for 3 years! and I use Chilli in EVERYTHING!). Let that boil up for a bit then cool it and freeze in individual portions, don't be too generous with your portion sizes here!  Spaghetti bolognase: Cook pasta according to packet instructions. Defrost or re-heat your meat sauce, adding dried italian herbs. Done.  Chilli con Carne: Cook rice according to packet instructions: Defrost/reheat your meat sauce with half a tin of kidney beans and as much chilli or chilli powder as you like. Done.  Keema Curry: Cook rice according to packet instructions: Defrost/reheat your meat sauce with half a tin of chickpeas, a handful of frozen peas and some curry powder.  Done.  This stops the same meal getting boring as hell without making something new every single night.  Poor man's vegetable stew. I used to make this one a lot in winter because the Co-op near where I lived used to have stewing packs of vegetables reduced to 33p for a kilo of veg frequently. It saw me through several winter's where I was dirt poor. Chop up your kilo of mixed veg (any root veg works well here, carrots, onions, swede, turnips, you name it. If it's going out of date and it's a vegetable, chuck it in!). Don't both peeling them, just give the skins a good scrub in hot water (waste not want not). Add to this 500g of potatoes and 2 tins of chickpeas/kidney beans/berlotti beans (anything with some cheap protein in!). Chuck it all in a big pot with enough water to cover the veg and a couple of vegetable stock cubes. Boil it until the veg is soft. Done.  Be willing to be flexible and try anything once. If it's cheap then just buy it, you can google how to cook anything these days. I hope this helps!"

And there are some really good contracts out there.  I just like the option of cancelling out if ever I know I need to really save money any particular month."

IANAL but if I recall correctly, the onus is on the retailer to prove that it's not a fault within 6 months, past that time it's the responsibility of the customer to prove that it isn't damage.  I might be wrong, but from my experience that's the case. In my shop (different phone provider than CPW), we would offer to send it off for repair, and then if it were a fault, we would repair it for free within the warranty period. If it's damaged, we would give you a quote for repair cost.   Hope that helps!"

AskUK,3dgb0m,bachus2015,4,Thu Jul 16 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, 50 applications in 3 months isn't that much if you're going for anything.   Do I just sign up, give them my CV and the type of work I'm looking for and hope for the best?    That's been my experience, yes. Some of them will ask you to do a couple of tests to ascertain your literacy level and stuff. My focus was office work, so I had to do a typing test for a couple of agencies, too.  If you're still looking after August time, hit the streets and get your face known around the bigger shops, as that's when they start racking up on pre-christmas seasonal staff."
AskUK,3dgb0m,lithaborn,3,Thu Jul 16 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, you turn up :) Or you can google, find a local agency and a suitable position then email your CV with a cover and be invited in. Or not, so keep looking as there are usually a few employment agencies in even a small town, or billions in London.   They'll have you fill in a fairly long form with personal details plus job history so have company names and dates to hand. They will probably also want passport/ID to prove you're legal to work in the UK, so take that.   I did admin stuff so was tested in word and excel.   Agency bods like you to be well dressed, up-beat and super keen. It's a slightly strange atmos in their offices - they're essential selling people to companies and they want you to buy into all the pep and enthusiasm, which might feel weird if that's generally not your bag. It's a lot about making an impression on them. Signing up with an agency is your interview for a job.  They might have positions they're trying to fill that day, so you'll get lucky. They might not, so chase them - phone calls and emails to follow up. Be clear about what you need - your hourly rate, or if it's just the summer then they might not do short term gigs. I sometimes did maternity cover so ~9 month placements. Some places are familiar with students working during vacation (is that your deal?), some aren't.   Pay attention to the vibe you get from them. They might not feel they can specifically help you but not say that directly. Never mind - you just trot up the high street and sign up with another one.   I temped for years (poor me) but did have a good relationship with my agency. I was waiting outside for them to open one time I got made redundant and they were lovely.   Edit: using agencies is a strange 'job' in itself, in a manner of speaking. You need to field phone calls, now what you need Â£ph, say yes to them, have a very good reason for saying no. It's slightly weird but v helpful to have them selling you, instead of selling yourself. Generally, signing up to the agency counts as your interview for a job. They're the middleman so if they get you something you're already in."
AskUK,3dgb0m,east_end,2,Thu Jul 16 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"Rock up to the agency, give them your CV, they'll ask what kind of work you're after and off you go. They may well be shitty jobs but they're something"
AskUK,3dgb0m,hutchero,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:26:17 2015 UTC,I have been working through agencies for 20 years ( I have crohns and can control my health better if I  control my work pattern ). I  earn good money and have regular work. All agencies lie and are only interested in the clients point of view but once you get used to them its a good way of working. Make sure you stand your ground with them. Take work you want and shift patterns that suit your life. They will try to get you doing all sorts.

The good news is that trichinosis (what you get from eating uncooked pork like you just did) is extremely rare, and even raw bacon is relatively safe to eat these days, although still disgusting and not a good idea.  What you do with bacon is you cook it on very low heat (if you have an electric stove 3) for about 10 minutes so the fat starts to render (become liquid).  Once things are nice and juicy, turn it up to 7, wait until it starts to smell good and curl away from the pan, flip it once, wait another 2-3 minutes, remove and eat."
AskUK,3dai96,Chive,3,Wed Jul 15 01:49:36 2015 UTC,"Another way to do a lot of bacon at once is to cook it in the oven.  Lay it out on a baking sheet, then stick it in a cold oven. Set to gas mark 5 and by the time it reaches that temperature the bacon should be cooked and crispy. Takes about 15-20 minutes.  I often cook bacon for my family of five, and that's probably the easiest way rather than doing it in batches in a pan."

AskUK,3dai96,chipaca,5,Wed Jul 15 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"You ate raw pork. Don't worry.  You can get one of two things. Campylobacter, which is really common (most common food borne illness, I think) and generally means you get the shits and then get better. Although it's pretty common, I can't find anything quickly about Campylobacter in the UK other than chicken.   Trichinosis, on the other hand, is a nasty parasite. A lot of people used to get it and some would die. Now, because of laws on what you can feed swine, plus sanitary and safety laws, there are few cases in the USA where I'm from and little to none reported in the UK for a while. Even if you get it, it's treatable with medication.  Most people say to cook your pork to 160Â°F to kill the bugs. That also makes it really dry. A well done pork chop is 160Â°F. Medium is like 150Â°F. Trichinae are killed at 137Â°F. You can cook pork Medium Rare at 145Â°F and still kill the bugs. But chances are, you could eat a pound of the stuff raw and not have an issue."

AskUK,3dai96,ManiacalV,2,Wed Jul 15 00:59:50 2015 UTC,"You do NOT want to cook meat to 220Â°F unless you want pork jerky or a hockey puck.  The parasite that causes trichinosis dies at about 140Â°F/60Â°C. If you cook your meat at that temp for a few minutes, you should be good. Anything higher is just preference and will dry out your meat more and more.  As a matter of fact, you can actually pasteurize pork in a Sous Vide by cooking it for 3-4 hours at 131Â°F/55Â°C if you want a safer way to eat rarer pork."
AskUK,3dai96,ShooTa666,2,Wed Jul 15 10:03:23 2015 UTC,"You're talking about the temperature of the meat itself, and not of the thing you're cooking it in/on. Gotcha. Thanks."
AskUK,3dai96,soundknowledge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:40:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when you Sous Vide, you basically shrink wrap the food and cook it at the temperature you want for hours. That's how you can pasteurize with it.   Otherwise, cook normal and use a thermometer."

AskUK,3dai96,nonpareilpearl,6,Tue Jul 14 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"As a rule of thumb, you should always cook meat in some fashion. If you know what meat it is, at the very least google the meat and what temperature it needs to be cooked to so that it is ""safe"". This may lead to the occasional overcooking... but that is certainly better than eating it raw O.O  As for cooking, I'm not from the UK (US), but I'd either cook it on a cast iron skillet if you have one, a regular pan, or heat it up in the oven..."

They will be about 10cm x 10cm (4"" x 4"")  What you should do is get a frying pan (buy one), and cook for probably around 8-10 minutes on medium heat (low then high is popular but let's keep it simple, it's your first go!)  5 minutes before your bacon is ready, you should put the rolls into the oven.  When the bacon is ready, remove the rolls, cut them in half and put the bacon in the middle.  Probably 3 rashes per roll.  You should add sauce to taste (tomato, brown, HP, barbecue, mayo, whatever -- tomato is most popular).  Finally, when all of this is made, you should invite me round and we can eat delicious bacon rolls together."

For the first three months (I think) you can limit the type of work you are looking for, providing you have a reasonable chance of finding such work. You can limit it to work related to your experience and qualifications. After that you will be expected to apply for any job you can do. If you fail to keep to the jobseeker's agreement you will probably be sanctioned, but if you do what they ask you should be OK. As for becoming a police officer. I don't know what help they can give, but many have link with career advisers so you would need to ask."

AskUK,3de9aj,sfmclaughlin,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Well my experience is only anecdotal, but no... It's really not as bad as you think. I actually put off claiming for a while after being made redundant and afterwards don't know why I'd been so silly.   The claim experience is divided into 3 parts. You initiate the claim online and then go for an initial assessment which is where you sign the ""job seeker's agreement"". This basically explains what you can expect from them and what you need to do to justify your money. This would be the time to mention you're limited for transport. Finally you return every 2 weeks to ""sign on"". This is where they review what you've done to find a job and, perhaps more importantly, agree you can have your money. It's worth bearing in mind that quite a lot of claimants will do little to find a job, so showing genuine willing will go down well. It's also less paperwork if they don't have to refuse your money.   Two things:  1) When you initiate your claim, you'll also get access to the online Government job search system called Universal Job Match. Don't dismiss it entirely... It's not terrible.   2) Use the online system to record your job search activity rather than the booklet. It makes the sign on process easier.   Finally, if you do get a job don't forget to ""sign off"" and remember that you'll get JSA for all the time you're unemployed. So if you're offered a job on  Wednesday to start Monday, you'll get payment for the ""waiting period""."

AskUK,3devn9,ebonhawk01,4,Wed Jul 15 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"You can get systems installed. Usually you'll want a door sensor for the main door and one or two motion sensors at other entry points on the ground floor (back door, living room). Generally what you do is arm the system before leaving the house which gives you about 30 seconds before the sensors go live. When you return and enter through the main door, the central system again gives 30 seconds to enter the pass code to disarm the system. If any other sensors are triggered first whilst the system is armed, the alarm will be triggered and keep ringing until the pass code is entered."
AskUK,3devn9,MDKrouzer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of alarm systems now have key fobs, similar to those that you use to lock and unlock car doors, which you can use to set or disarm the alarm. That's way easier than having to key in a code.  Also many alarms can be wired in to the phone to alert you if they get triggered; alternatively for professionally-installed alarms they can dial a monitoring centre who can then automatically alert the police if necessary.  For this kind of level of service you'll be looking at several hundred quid for the initial installation and probably a monthly service charge of around Â£20..  If it's just for more general peace of mind then the DIY kits are OK, but do try to get a decent one rather than the cheapest you can find.  Also bear in mind that career burglars will generally be able to identify a DIY installation just from the make and design of the external bell box. Then again, if you think you've got a property or contents that a career burglar might be targetting then you probably want a professional alarm installation anyway. A good medium-end DIY kit should be sufficient to keep out opportunistic kids and smackheads, which is really all that most people need."

AskUK,3ddaim,gazuzu,3,Wed Jul 15 11:01:54 2015 UTC,"Andrews & Arnold may be a good fit for your needs. I have never used them but I've always wanted to, they have a very good reputation and don't filter their Internet access (pretty much everyone else does).  If you go for the ""home::1"" tariff it's initial period is six months.   "" Home::1 Home::1 has a simple 6 month initial term and then ongoing contract. There is no cease charge.""  Just to be clear, I have no affiliation with them, I've just admired their stance on censorship and privacy for a long time. The downside is, you get what you pay for: there are cheaper ISPs although they don't care about censorship or privacy and most of them require 12-24 month contract.   http://aaisp.net/broadband-home1.html  My brother uses Plusnet, it had/has a special offer where all he's paying is the line rental for a certain period. I've used this extensively, it is filtered and despite being fibre, the speed is rarely above 1-2Mb/s. It is cheap though.   TalkTalk usually have some offers on at any given time and are popular because they're cheap. They filter and have consistently been at the bottom of consumer quality / satisfaction lists (most complaints to OFCOM, the ombudsman). I've had several family members and friends on TalkTalk and would recommend you steer clear! Really unreliable connection, bad customer service. It's always a case of YMMV of course but it isn't just an opinion, they've earned their reputation.   I personally use Three and have a personal wifi hotspot via my phone. I am in a 4G area though. It's fast enough and cheap (pay as you go,  Â£15 pcm, unlimited internet, 3000 texts, 300 minutes). The connection can sometimes be flaky but nowhere near as bad as their reputation, it started off (years ago) as very flaky and became a joke, not been like that for a decade for me / my area, but it might be a good idea to check coverage online. They do filter some, but I don't know what the criteria is as I can access some porn, yet certain blogs gets randomly removed.  That's all I can think of."
AskUK,3ddaim,darbulto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:27:52 2015 UTC,"To be clear, are you only going to be in the UK for 6 months or have you just signed up to a 6 month tenancy on a place?  I ask because most broadband contracts will move with you if you move house.  PlusNet aren't bad and offer a no-contract option, although unsurprisingly it's a little more expensive.  Uswitch throws up a couple of other options although both of them are with quite small companies (which doesn't necessarily mean they're bad, just that feedback may be somewhat limited)."
AskUK,3ddaim,IxionS3,2,Wed Jul 15 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"We are in the proccess of signing a tenancy for 6 months.  What you said was interesting though, I thought when you signed a contract for a broadband, if would be for that particular house.  So basically, if we sign a 12 month broadband contract with virgin, (lets supose that), after moving from this flat in 6 months, we can continue that contract on another flat?  That may solve everything..."
AskUK,3ddaim,MDKrouzer,4,Wed Jul 15 11:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, most ISPs would be happy for you to keep the contract with them. Some may charge a moving fee."
AskUK,3ddaim,IxionS3,2,Wed Jul 15 11:44:16 2015 UTC,"As /u/MDKrouzer said pretty much any ISP will be happy to let you transfer to a new address during the contract period. I'd double check before signing anything but I'd be surprised if anyone wouldn't allow it, although there may be some fees.  One thing to be aware of with Virgin is that they are a cable company who own their own network, whereas pretty much every other ISP you might find uses BT's network at least for the ""last mile"" to your home.  This means that Virgin's tends to be available only in large cities and coverage can have odd gaps - all the streets around me have Virgin service but mine does not, for example.  I'm not sure what would happen if you signed up for Virgin and then wanted to move mid-contract to an address they could not serve."

AskUK,3ddaim,oblong89334,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"Surely you can break the contract because you can no longer get the speeds you signed up for? We signed up for an 18 month BT Infinity contract knowing we had a 12-month rental contract and specifically asked what would happen if we moved to an area without Infinity. They told us we could break the contract completely without penalty, they didn't say we'd have to use BT ADSL.  (I don't know for sure what would happen, though, because we didn't test it when we moved out. We actually moved out to a new build property with no BT services at all and no means to get a BT connection put in due to no further capacity at the exchange, so there was no question about whether we could break the contract - they had no way of providing a service.)"
AskUK,3ddaim,Chaoss86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:35 2015 UTC,"This ones a doozy but can look like a minefield to an outsider...  First you want to check the address you will be moving too to see what services are available. Make sure you do a postcode and address check not just an area check.  You might see one or all of the following... Cable - this is Virgin Media in the UK, Virgin Media offer great speeds however not unlike Comcast in the states their customer service can be terrible and their service often goes down without warning, these outages can last hours! Many areas are over-subscribed so you may find your speeds suffer at peak times.  Speeds Available 1: 50Mbit down, 3Mbit up 2: 100Mbit down, 6Mbit up 3: 152Mbit down, 12Mbit up  Virgin are also trialing 300Mbit down and 15Mbit up and will most likely be upgrading their speeds which they do semi-regularly. Again their service and customer services can suffer from problems. You will always get the advertised speeds from Virgin if the service is working as expected.  FTTC/B/H - This is the best and what you should hope to get, Always choose this option if available!! Who the best ISP are is open to heated debate but the primary ones are BT (the package you want is called BT Infinity). I personally use TalkTalk Business, Andrew & Arnold are pretty awesome but it can cost quite a lot and is really meant for tech heads. Openreach (part of BT) run the entire network, TalkTalk have their own equipment at the exchange so the 2 main FTTC ISP's are TalkTalk and BT. Other ISP's except Virgin will be using the infrastructure.  Speeds Available 1: 40Mbit down, 20Mbit up (often advertised as a bit less, usually 36Mbit down) 2:80Mbit down, 20Mbit up (often advertised as 76Mbit)  You will get what your line can support, depending on distance from the street cabinet usually ranges from 55Mbit to the full 80Mbit. This is a physical limitation and not bad business practice!  ADSL - If you only see ""upto 16Mbit"" offered as the best option available to you then I have some bad news for you, you can only get ADSL and will most likely get quite poor speeds. ADSL technology in this country is very behind the rest of the world and rather than connecting to the street cabinets, your line connects all the way to the nearest exchange (most large cities have 2 or 3, in London most but not all boroughs have an exchange). This means that ADSL speeds range from around .5Mbit down and .1Mbit up to 15Mbit down and 1.2Mbit up. DO NOT expect anything better than that. you do not want to select this option unless you have no other option.  Speeds Available 16Mbit down, 1.2Mbit up (or 2.2Mbit up if you find an ISP that supports ANNEX M), you will probably not get the advertised speeds)"

AskUK,3denf4,Cheese-n-Opinion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help. I actually have a number of books about the varieties of English around the UK. I didn't mean to suggest that chav is a flattering term or even an homogenous group. My lecture is more about the phenomenon of chavs and how language plays a part in the stereotyping. I had wanted some opinions about nonstandard lower class speech from UK natives, but I guess it's a touchier subject than I realized. Although tact was never one of my strong suits."
AskUK,3denf4,Cheese-n-Opinion,3,Wed Jul 15 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, if you look at /r/britishproblems for example many uk redditors are perfectly happy to stereotype and rant against chavs, with varying degrees of seriousness.  I think you're getting evasive answers here not so much because you were tactless, or that people are touchy about opinions per se, as much as suddenly realising that if their opinions are transposed to a classroom setting, to an audience who can't contextualise them with their own experiences, they need to be backed up a whole lot more.  Trouble is, nobody can.  For starters, people are accustomed to their local area's chavilect, but not knowledgeable enough to confidently make statements about chav speech nationwide.  Probably a bigger problem is that chavs are like that famous judge's quote about pornography, I know it when I see it.    IMHO one issue here is that chavs can't really be distinguished by speech features alone.  For example your stereotypical chav will consistently conjugate verbs ""incorrectly"" (""you was wrong"", ""I weren't even there"") but those traits are also common to heaps of northern dialects, pretty class-agnostically.  So realistically you're only going to pin 'chav' on someone through a combination of speech, appearance, behaviour.  Anyway I'm rambling but I guess my point is that people are probably just wary of giving casual non-linguist anecdotes that could be taken too weightily or what have you (despite non-linguist anecdotes being what you want, and you seem pretty capable of assessing them accordingly).  As for me, and given all the above waffly disclaimers, besides 'innit', I'd say one of the most distinctively chavvy speech traits is speaking with an (affected?) nasal tone."
AskUK,3denf4,the_vig,2,Wed Jul 15 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"Isn't 'you was' more of a Southern English thing? Impressionistically I'd say Southern dialects level past tense of 'to be' in favour of 'was', and Northern dialects to 'were'.    ""You was doing that,"" seems so Cockney or Essex to my ears, whereas ""She were doing it"" sounds pure Lancashire."
AskUK,3denf4,the_vig,3,Wed Jul 15 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"Er.... You might be right.  I think you just proved my point about being wary of saying something when you're not really au fait with the whole country, let alone a linguist, so someone from somewhere else can promptly pop up and make you wrong, lol ;)"
AskUK,3denf4,lgf92,3,Wed Jul 15 23:59:40 2015 UTC,No that's completely wrong. Those are common traits in plenty of regional accents.
AskUK,3denf4,atticus01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:06 2015 UTC,"I know they're found in a variety of other accents, including some in the states as well. I didn't actually say they weren't. I've just read that they may be common among different groups of chavs in different cities."
AskUK,3denf4,benryves,2,Wed Jul 15 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"H-dropping is actually markedly not prevalent in the stereotypical 'London chav's' accent, which would be some form of MLE. That's in contrast to the more old-fashioned accents of London, like cockney, and many others nationwide."

AskUK,3denf4,benryves,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:59 2015 UTC,This is a segment from one of our finest light entertainment broadcasts that's actually quite interesting and relevant:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WUUIG_vgWc
AskUK,3denf4,atticus01,4,Thu Jul 16 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"This question is in danger of getting a lot of conflicting and obfuscating replies. Firstly, 'chav' is very nebulous, and loaded with classism. It can mean anything from specifically young, unkempt lads with criminal tendencies to basically the entire bottom rung on the British social ladder. I've also heard people claim that it refers simply to a dress-code and sub-culture that isn't necessarily dependant on wealth or class. It's my opinion that many people profess to using the term in the first and last sense whilst actually using it in the second for all intents and purposes.    I think a lot of this confusion over what the term 'chav' refers to is down to the fact that its only quite reently become nationally widespread. Before the turn of the millennium people used a host of different regional terms for various kinds of local subcultures of lower-class people, petty criminals or delinquent teenagers. Tabloid media helped rapidly spread the term and I suspect a lot of nuance was lost in the process.  If you've read up on British English you'll understand that it can be viewed as a pyramid, with regional variation most extreme amongst the lower classes diminishing to a homogeneous 'posh accent' at the top of the heap. As such chav speech exhibits massive regional diversity. Anyone thinking of chavs as mostly lower-class might point out extreme regionalisms as chav-speak; anyone equating them with 'the youth of today' will give you neologisms and recent accent trends. Neither of these would be representative of a widespread and exclusively 'chavvy' dialect."
AskUK,3denf4,Perihelion_,9,Thu Jul 16 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"You won't get 2 people to agree because 'chav' is an entirely subjective description - like the underclass or poor white trash, and it's quite a nasty classist thing for you to be introducing into a classroom  ""oh, this is what poor people sound like"""
AskUK,3denf4,ab00,0,Wed Jul 15 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, I was wondering if there might be a common accent, but my take is that stereotypes about what a chav is are completely unfair, that they can't be grouped into one group by behavior, much like rednecks in the states. That said, just because it's not right to stereotype people as thieves and wife abusers doesn't mean that in some areas lower class people (not a judgement call, just a fact about income, education level, etc) often have speech characteristics that are particular to them. That doesn't make this speech worse or less-than, just different in certain ways. I certainly didn't mean to offend anybody."
AskUK,3denf4,Cheese-n-Opinion,8,Wed Jul 15 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"'Chav' is an insulting term. Nobody uses it about a quality they admire. Lower class people, as you term it, tend to have a more extreme regional accent - there isn't a 'poor' accent, and talking about chavs as though it's some kind of Dickension theme-park cum Dick Van Dyke sideshow is offensive."
AskUK,3denf4,InvertedMountain,0,Wed Jul 15 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"My lecture is about how the stereotypes are untrue and are classist. I'm not sure how that qualifies as treating the phenomenon like a sideshow. I was just asking if there are dialectal differences particular to this group called chavs. Again, I apologize if I offended you. Perhaps chav has more of a harsh connotation than I realized. I had assumed it was a term like redneck - not particularly flattering and certainly able to be used pejoratively, but not inherently offensive."

Never mind that, why are you starting with something so controversial?  Also remember that class is a mega, mega touchy thing here and I would be very wary of a) even defining 'chav' as a concept, b) ignoring regionalisms ('chavs' in the north-east speak very, very differently from 'chavs' in, say, Wales) and c) being patronising or demeaning."

'You what?' is a perfectly normal colloquial expression in my neck of the woods in North-West England, used even by middle class people in informal settings. Its just a very casual 'pardon?', I'd use it with my siblings but not my auntie!

AskUK,3d899b,stevemegson,29,Tue Jul 14 07:55:56 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, if the address doesn't end "".gov.uk"" then it's not the official site. These copy-cat sites exist for all sorts of things - passports, tax returns, EHIC, driving licences.

AskUK,3d899b,Harrod200,7,Tue Jul 14 08:17:53 2015 UTC,"Glad you felt suspicious; these websites have been on Watchdog and similar programmes a lot; they're not exactly scams, but they're charging you for 'added value' service, without adding any actual value. I think the gov't has made some token gestures towards shutting the worst of them down (i.e. the ones that charge you but then don't even pass your application onto the gov systems), but I've not seen any solid moves towards actually shuttering their operations for good.  There are however a few govt sites that do ask for payment; road tax renewal I know for certain, I'm not sure about driving licence replacements and passports; these services do have a cost involved, but I can't say first-hand that it's paid for online."
AskUK,3d899b,BCMM,2,Tue Jul 14 12:14:23 2015 UTC,"Your link doesn't work    The link is broken because OP accidentally copied a Unicode left-to-right mark along with the URL. Such marks are used in documents that use both LTR and RTL writing systems, and this has probably happened because OP usually uses a right-to-left script like Arabic on their computer.  Reddit then incorrectly decided that the trailing LRM was part of the URL. The mark is invisible, but if you mouse-over the link you can most likely see evidence of it because most browsers represent weird  characters in URLs using numerical character references.

We are not affiliated with HMRC or any government body.   I supposed it might be worth using them if applying from abroad proves difficult due to international calls, time-zones and so on, but you were probably looking for this page instead.  By the way, there are a couple of fairly obvious signs that that's not a Government website, which could be useful for future web searching:  Firstly, it is a .co.uk domain - those are intended for private businesses, and anybody can get one. It's basically a British version of .com. Most British Government web sites use the restricted .gov.uk domain (but there are a few others like .nhs.uk).  Secondly, the first real search result on Google is always more likely to be legitimate than the first sponsored result."

Overall I would say that Dagenham is alright during the day but some parts can get a bit dicey at night so it really depends where about you are working there.   As for the Havering side of things (Hornchurch, Upminster and the like) things tend to be a bit quieter than Dagenham (Barring the obvious shopping/clubbing area of Romford of course) but a bit of situational awareness never hurts.   East London's rep tends to be exaggerated by people who have never stepped foot here but believe it to be full of knife wielding hoodies, benefit fraudsters and immigrant criminals because the Daily Mail told them so. Basically just don't do anything stupid and keep your wits about you and you can easily avoid what little trouble there is to run into there.  Edit: Ohh and I second the whole C2C recommendation. Transport as a whole is one of the great things about London and even this far out the C2C (followed closely by the District Line) is the fastest way to get into the city centre and still operates on transport for London's Oyster Card system."
AskUK,3da97a,Summersunflowers,5,Sun Jul 19 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"Hornchurch (particularly the Upminster end) and Upminster both have nice high streets. There are lots of restaurants in Hornchurch, my favourite is Sukhothai (Thai). I have never been but the Ginger Lounge in Upminster is meant to be good for curry.  As you said it is very green, lots of parks.   Transport in to London is great, you can get the c2c train from Upminster in to Fenchruch Street as well as the District line from Upminster/Upminster Bridge/Hornchurch. You can also get a bus in to Romford and get the TFL Rail trains in to Stratford / Liverpool Street (I would not recommend Romford for dinner etc.).   Couple of other restaurants you could get a cab to are Miller & Carter in Hainault, Shepherd & Dog in Harold Wood, George & the Dragon in Mountnessing. There are a few Ember Inns pubs nearby that are nice for a cheap-ish dinner / drinks (The Optimist / The Harrow)."

Then stop it when the car goes over the next  mark. The system calculates the speed from the time between points over distance between points.  The points are a known distance apart.   I might be wrong on the exact details though.   Police can also use obvious landmarks like lamp posts, etc."

AskUK,3d9hpu,Esco91,2,Wed Jul 15 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on what sort of thing you like. The Highlands are great if you like scenery, walking and generally being outdoors. Swimming in lochs, walking up big hills to look at the loch you just swam in, find seals etc is all good fun."

AskUK,3d9hpu,Esco91,2,Tue Jul 14 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"If you like walking and hiking, don't count northern Scotland out, even as a lone tourist - lots of others go there alone and there are various groups and clubs which do day tours at little to no cost. Also, probably the best place in the UK for going out at night alone, the Highland Scots are not shy when it comes to making friends after a few drams or McEwens.   York is a good suggestion if you like to visit museums and old style town centres and buildings, but I wouldn't visit as a single tourist, the locals are a bit aloof (one of the few areas in the north you'd describe as rich) and it tends to be more of a day trip location for groups - stag parties, racegoers, couples. Also a nightmare to drive around in the summer months. Better to base in Leeds, go on day trips to York (by train) and visit the much calmer Knaresborough, Yorks Sculpture Park, Harewood House by car and spend a couple of days in Leeds doing stuff like the Armories. If you want to see real Britain, go to Headingley and take in a cricket or rugby league match, both of which are in season now and attract very different crowds, both of which will be very accepting of a foreigner who speaks as good english as you clearly do!"

Must have good pubs, visit a few vinyards and local breweries??  The good thing is that most of these would be a day trip rather than a lot of time travelling. It's amazing  how quickly you can be in the typical British countryside from London.   Really as said before it depends what you like to do!"

All the important stuff ). HMRC are the last one to accept the change.  It has been months and letters are still going to the old address. I feel sorry for the person at my old flat but there is nothing I can do to speed it up.  I wish there was. . Just keep sending them back and if you feel the need  inform the letting agent of what's happening.  There is a 1% chance you may get a visit,  maybe less, if so just give them the letting agents details."
AskUK,3d91uy,mitch1975,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:57 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone. I eventually got through to somebody at HMRC and they said the best course of action is simply to keep returning the letters.

AskUK,3d91uy,stevemegson,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's much more you can do really. You'd need to know which bit of HMRC is sending the letters, which you can't really find out without opening them (unless you can see anything useful through the window). HMRC doesn't have much of a central contact point, there isn't even a central complaints department that you could direct a ""your undelivered mail department isn't doing its job"" complaint to."

AskUK,3d7utn,mitch1975,26,Tue Jul 14 06:19:05 2015 UTC,Some bits were built with concrete to save money when budgets were tight.  I know this because i found myself reading wikipedia pages about motorways last week...

AskUK,3dahxz,thecharleskerr,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:04 2015 UTC,With oyster/contactless the time of the initial touch-in is what determines if a peak or off peak fare is charged. Other things to note is that the evening peak counts towards off-peak caps and does not apply to journeys into zone 1 from other zones.  In your example the morning journey will be peak and the afternoon one will be off-peak.

AskUK,3d8bpu,Upsidedown_Trousers,8,Wed Jul 15 12:43:18 2015 UTC,"It sounds like these are supply (relief) agencies. So yeah, you'd be doing nothing but cover work...  ...which could be tricky. Anywhere other than London, you'd definitely need a car to get to most schools. In London, you could easily find yourself with a three-hour round trip by public transport. Property rental costs in London are eye-watering, too.  I'd advise doing some more research, and finding organisations that recruit overseas to fill permanent places, because this does happen. The biggest demand for teachers is in London, because of the cost of living vs. the only slightly-higher salary, but there'll be other options across England. (If you're male, all the better, there's a dire shortage of male primary teachers!)  In this situation, you'd be treated pretty much like any NQT (newly-qualified teacher), assigned your own class from day one but with some additional support from senior staff. You'd be expected to be fully up-to-speed with the English curriclum, the normal systems for assessment and record-keeping, the mandated formal tests (SATs), and so on. The up-side of this is that you'd be earning a full (and reliable) teacher's salary, covering a full 12-month period or ongoing beyond that.  Scotland and Northern Ireland's education systems have always been totally seperate from England's, so you'll need to get specific advice from people who know those, and the Welsh system is also now autonomous.  www.tes.co.uk is the main publication for the profession, browsing that will give you an idea of the current issues. Also, 'SES' isn't a term you'll find used here, but you'll find references to x% of pupils eligible for free school meals or FSM - this is a crude but surprisingly accurate measure of children from deprived backgrounds, as it indicates low household incomes. Ofsted routinely report it in their description of a school and its environs, for instance.  Oh, yeah, Ofsted. You'll want to research them...."

AskUK,3d8bpu,szczypka,4,Tue Jul 14 13:46:14 2015 UTC,"A couple of pointers....  Double and triple check that your teaching qualification is relevant here, if it's not then you're looking at a year of education here to get the right bit of paper. I'd expect it to be given the similar levels of the two countries but definitely need to check.  Criminal background checks - look into how these work for non UK citizens.  Mine was super simple because I've lived a very boring life with very few previous addresses all in the UK.  But these checks can take a while and you can't work alone with kids until you have one.  Can't really give you any feedback on the specific offers you're seeing.. have you placed the question in an Australian sub too to see if anyone else has done it?"
AskUK,3d8bpu,nolo_me,4,Tue Jul 14 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"If you're working as a supply teacher, you generally get the shitty end of the stick because the kids will be harder to deal with than they are for their regular teachers (and they can be pretty challenging to deal with in the first place). However, you'll get paid much more per day than a regular teacher would, and if you hate the school you can leave at the end of the day and never go back. So swings and roundabouts.  Classroom culture will depend on so many factors: behaviour management across the school, catchment area, cultural norms for students' communities, quality of teaching and learning in a subject area, etc etc etc. A full time teacher will probably do about a 12 hour work day, plus one day at the weekend. The cost of living (outside of London) is fairly ok - the further north you go, generally, the cheaper things get."

AskUK,3d87n9,stevemegson,3,Tue Jul 14 08:02:11 2015 UTC,"You can be pretty sure it was sold in May then, since the dealer wouldn't have any reason to tax it. The DVLA may be willing to confirm that if you ask them. I doubt they'll tell you who the current registered keeper is, but they should be able to confirm that you're no longer the registered keeper and the date on which that changed. A history check here would also show the date the registered keeper changed for Â£2.89.  Assuming you find the date on which you think the car was sold, I'd then write a letter before action stating that you have reason to believe that the car was sold on that date and that they therefore owe you Â£4K under the terms of your contract. State that they have 14 days to make payment or you'll begin court action.  Chances are that just the credible threat of court action will make them stop stalling. If it actually got to court then that may be a problem if you're overseas, but it seems unlikely that it would get as far as a hearing if you can provide a copy of the contract and written evidence that the car has been sold. It's difficult to see what response they could offer, so you could almost certainly make the claim online and deal with everything else by post, though I think you'd need a UK address that the court can use."

AskUK,3d4zs7,ppphhh,27,Mon Jul 13 16:06:01 2015 UTC,"Okay I found the law, section 65 of the ""Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847"" says;  ""The occupiers of houses and other buildings in the streets shall mark their houses with such numbers as the commissioners approve of, and shall renew such numbers as often as they become obliterated or defaced; and every such occupier who fails, within one week after notice for that purpose from the commissioners, to mark his house with a number approved of by the commissioners, or to renew such number when obliterated, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding [F19[F20Â£20]][F19level 1 on the standard scale], and the commissioners shall cause such numbers to be marked or to be renewed, as the case may require, and the expence thereof shall be repaid to them by such occupier, and shall be recoverable as damages.""

AskUK,3d4zs7,StormySan,5,Mon Jul 13 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"I would assume this to be true, simply because there are so many households, likely millions nationwide, that don't have displayed house numbers.

AskUK,3d4zs7,szczypka,0,Mon Jul 13 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"If you check the wording of the act, it specifically applies to ""towns and cities"", so rural areas aren't covered by the requirement."

AskUK,3d4zs7,collinsl02,3,Tue Jul 14 09:17:16 2015 UTC,"The fine was Â£2 in 1847, and rose to Â£20 in 1967. It doesn't really mean that the offence was still actively being enforced then though, since the changes were just part of blanket changes to any fines which had become stupidly low.  Having said that, the previous section seems to still be the current legislation requiring councils to put up street name signs, and you can find plenty of councils referring to the act in their policies on street naming."

AskUK,3d48h0,Alunnite,12,Mon Jul 13 11:51:44 2015 UTC,"Hello! For the last two years, I have had no broadcast TV. If you want to go completely that way, the hardest thing you will have to convince them of is how the TV licence works. There is a lot of misinformation about it, but here's the headlines:   You need a licence if you watch any TV as it is broadcast, through any medium, whether it's on the Internet or through an aerial, BBC or not. You do not need a licence if you watch via catch-up services, even iPlayer. You do not need a licence for radio, even when accessed through a TV set. You do not need a licence for simply owning equipment that can watch broadcast TV - it is the act of watching it that is licenced.   If they are happy to use catchup services for things through iPlayer, 4oD etc (although I think 4oD is called something else now), then they might be able to save that Â£150 per year if they aren't entitled to a free licence. If they want to be able to sit down and watch whatever's on, then of course that doesn't apply - but Freeview will be the best option as the only thing you'll be missing in that case is the specialist channels.  Currently, I've found that the best solution for me is via my games consoles and my Chromecast. I fire Chromecast up for anything UK based - iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube are all really easy to use with it. I also subscribe to Unblock Us, a proxy service, which gives me a custom DNS for my console, and allows me to access media (mainly Netflix) from other regions - it's a one time setup and easy to switch between them. Often, shows that are only available on, say Amazon Prime in the UK, are on Netflix elsewhere - for example, I watched Terminator 2 last night on German Netflix and watch the West Wing from the US selection. You can search those regions with flixsearch.io - the reason I do this on my console and not my Chromecast is because my current router doesn't support DNS changes.  I'd definitely recommend taking advantage of the free trials for Now TV and Prime Video etc - I've found the way they work pretty poor (Now TV removes content very quickly and the app doesn't work amazingly well, Prime has a smaller selection inclusive and the rest you pay extra for) but they may suit your parents well.   Altogether I pay less than Â£10 a month for Netflix and Unblock Us, not counting internet access and without the Â£150 a year for the licence fee."
AskUK,3d48h0,Willeth,10,Mon Jul 13 12:06:30 2015 UTC,"You do not need a licence if you watch via catch-up services, even iPlayer.   Though it seems that situation is going to change soon:  http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/osborne-slashes-bbc-budget-pay-over-75s-tv-licences"

PS4 for most things, Chromecast if I want to stream anything across the network (I have no idea why, but my wife likes watching me play Heroes of the Storm a lot...)

AskUK,3d48h0,gundog48,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"Depends, want to do it legit or not? We've been doing much the same thing lately, it's very easy to do. We've got BT broadband which we've been really happy with having switched from Tiscali/TalkTalk, it also comes with BT Sport included. With that done, you can get a BTTV box which is basically a HD Freeview box which will also do BT Sport, between that, BBC and ITV you'll have most of your sport covered if that's something you're interested in, I've found that to be the most awkward bit. This will just cost Â£30 for them to ship the box to you, which is a lot cheaper than equivalent Freeview boxes as I understand.  The thing has an interface for Netflix, so if you want to subscribe to Netflix you can massively increase your on-demand TV for a very small price and without any real fuckery.  I've also set up an on-demand system of my own, but it's not legit if that's important. Raspberry Pi set up with XBMC plugged into the TV, networked, and controlled with a normal remote. Then I've got a server on the network (it doesn't need to be dedicated, you can use your normal PC if you wanted, though wired is best), put a 3TB HDD in it, and host all the files in a public folder. Films can be downloaded manually, for TV shows, especially ongoing ones, Sickbeard is an amazing tool. Set up the sources, I use The Pirate Bay and a few other public trackers, then tell it which TV shows you want to watch along with your quality settings and it'll get you up to date and download new episodes as soon as they are released. It'll even tell the Raspberry Pi to update it's sources once it's done. You may want to go with a good VPN like PIA for security. XBMC is a nice interface, this would also be a great opportunity to centralise your music and photos to be played and viewed from the TV and automatically backed up. If you're serious about centralising music, you can use JRiver Media Center (absolutely fantastic). This'll sync up the music you choose on your phone, including organising it into playlists and other cool stuff like streaming your music on your phone when you're on the network, ideal if you have a big library but small storage capacity on your phone. Just cuts the bullshit out of organising music. Organise it on one device and it's organised for all of them. But I digress.  Doing this setup can be a bit of hassle, but it's fantastic! You can do away with all your DVDs, you get box sets of your favourite TV shows to watch in proper order and you'll be kept up to date with shows as the episodes come out. The interface and convenience is better than anything legit I know of, and gives you the ultimate control. If you're thinking of making a server specifically for this (which can double up for a variety of server applications as well as a media one), you may as well forget the Raspberry Pi and make it a HTPC and plug the server straight into your TV!  So we cut our Â£60+ a month Sky subscription and got something better for Â£30 one-off on the box and Â£7/mo for Netflix (which you may already have). The other setup is free to run, far better, but requires more setup. You may have the parts like I did to set it up virtually free, can get a little pricy doing it from scratch, but there's no better alternative I've found!"

AskUK,3d48h0,0ldg0dofasgard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:04:22 2015 UTC,"Amazon fire stick is the cheapest option at 35 quid If they order alot from Amazon its worth signing up for prime as they get free next day delivery and access to amazons video  streaming library which all integrates nicely on the fire sticks menu. You can also get Netflix and IPlayer apps for it as well as Channel 5 on demand. ITV don't officially have an app but the Scottish ITV STV does, it asks your postcode on first startup, Google a scottish one, put that in and you'll get all the ITV programmes.  Fire stick is simpler to use than chromecast as it has a remote with it so you don't need a smartphone. Amazons tech support are also very good. And if you need to return it they have the simplest consumer friendly return policy of any online retailer. You'll have your replacement the next day and then have a month to return the faulty one and they'll give you a label to print off and either send a courier to collect it or get you to drop it off at a corner shop.  Internet wise BT are rolling out fibre right now, an unlimited 70 Mb connection is Â£26 a month (which is about the same price as the 16Mb non fibre offering), there is also a 35 Mb service which is slightly cheaper) plus Â£16 a month line rental which they are already paying if they have a landline. On the BT website they can put in their postcode to see what services are available in their area.  Other companies offer broadband but they all use BTs infrastructure and alot of them aren't truely unlimited and throttle during peak time or if you use too much which is a huge issue when you're streaming alot of video   In bigger cities Virgin media are available and offer better adveetised fibre speeds than BT, but I've found their service and actual speeds (especially during peak times) to be very poor, your mileage may vary and 35 Mb is more than enough for streaming one thing at a time.  If they want more choice with Netflix then they can use a service like Uno telly DNS (on my phone so don't have URL to hand, but Google them) it allows you to switch between any Netflix region (which all have different content) and their website has fairly easy to follow tutorials for setting it up on all sorts of devices, they offer a free trial as well"

AskUK,3d57xv,Eloquai,5,Mon Jul 13 17:04:49 2015 UTC,You could quite easily be arrested pending further enquiries though.  ie Girlfriend says to boyfriend please fill up my car with petrol and use my card. Boyfriend attempts to pay for petrol. Hands card to cashier to put in chip and pin machine. Cashier notices card is in name of Miss Smith. Calls Police. Police arrive. Boyfriend explains situation and Police try to contact cardholder without success. He clearly isn't Miss Smith so he may well be arrested until his story can be verified.  Also remember even if it's legal a retailer can refuse to serve you without giving a reason. It's private property so you have no right to be there and approaching the till to pay is legally only an attempt to enter into a contract. The retailer is not obliged to enter into that contract.   It's also a breach of the card terms and conditions. Somewhere it always says the card is the property of the bank.

AskUK,3d6hts,oblong89334,2,Tue Jul 14 19:13:30 2015 UTC,I doubt less grants will cost more money
AskUK,3d6hts,IAMACiderDrinker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:14:31 2015 UTC,"It's complicated. That's the obvious assumption, but it totally depends on how much money people actually pay back.  When they changed from Â£3k fees plus govt subsidy to Â£9k fees without subsidy (or at least massively reduced subsidy) people assumed taxpayers would pay less towards the system, since taxpayers provided the govt subsidy. However, it was obvious that more people than previously wouldn't pay their entire loans back, since the monthly repayments had actually decreased (due to a higher repayment threshold, since everyone still pays back 9% over the threshold) and the loans were still going to get written off after a similar period of time. Hopefully this makes sense so far.  The govt originally thought 28% of students would have part of their loans written off. They then realised it was actually going to be around 45%. An economics body worked out that if just under 49% of students had part of their loans written off, the Â£9k system would actually be more expensive for the taxpayer than the Â£3k plus subsidy system (see same link). I don't know how it could be more expensive because logically you wouldn't expect that given the cost-slashing, but the government hasn't actually denied that the numbers are this close, just said that things might change given this is a projection for many years in the future.  They're now proposing to increase the size of the loans, but haven't said anything about requiring higher repayments, or stopping loan write-offs. I am concerned about how close we are to the tipping point of writeoffs - if 45% already can't pay their loan back in 30 years, how many more are going to have loans written off if you add an extra Â£12k on top of that? Obviously losing the grant saves some money, but that was the logic behind the increase to Â£9k fees and the numbers above suggest that that's fairly close to actually having increased the cost to taxpayers rather than reduced it. And the current government has no particular need to care - it would be a problem in around 30 years when the loans start getting written off."
AskUK,3d6hts,IAMACiderDrinker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:50 2015 UTC,Are you already at uni (or starting in September 2015)?  If so then the changes won't affect you anyway - it's only for new students from September 2016 onwards.    If it does affect you... currently the maximum entitlement of maintenance loan + maintenance grant (assuming living away from home and studying outside London) is around Â£7400.  From September 2016 the maximum entitlement of maintenance loan will be Â£8200 - again assuming living away from home and studying outside London.

We wield ungodly power because of this and the fact we invented the sport (eg IFAB - who decide the rules of football consists of 8 votes, one each to the home FAs and four to FIFA).  So if Team GB were to exist, then they'd have to play qualifying tournaments (qualification to the 2016 olympics was done based on the European U21 championships this summer), so we'd have to register as a separate team.  Before you know it, we're only allowed a Team GB and not separate countries or separate leagues.  Which we don't want.  Scotland has a strong tradition of football with well supported leagues and a historically important national team (ranked 29th now), Wales might not have a strong league, but it is ranked 10th in the world now.  Northern Ireland is ranked 37th.  Why wouldn't we want them to remain?"
AskUK,3d4xu2,whencanistop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"The reason why it probably won't happen is that the rules of football is governed by the International football association board and is made up of FIFA and the FA's of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. To change the rules you need 6 votes and each FA gets 1 vote and fifa gets 4 so if you merged the FA's which would make one national team you would need to reconfigure the IFAB.   If there was one national I'm pretty sure Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland might kick up a fuss about the possibility of being underrepresented in the team"

That way you'll be able to ease yourself back in to the workplace, and may be able to use a manager/supervisor from your placement as one of your references.

KLM isn't quite as nice as JAL or BA but certainly very comfortable. Air France do something similar with a stop in Paris.

AskUK,3d3844,lgf92,4,Mon Jul 13 13:31:20 2015 UTC,"I've never met a die hard darts fan in my life. I'm sure they exist, but the people I know that have been just because it's something to do and you can go out and get pissed."

AskUK,3d3844,ichliebekuchen,3,Mon Jul 13 09:35:47 2015 UTC,Pretty interesting. I figure the whole championships grew out of pub leagues. It explains the semi-ironic hyping up and the slight cheesiness of the whole thing.
AskUK,3d3844,concretepigeon,2,Mon Jul 13 09:38:57 2015 UTC,"The history is pretty interesting, there was basically a bunch of infighting and the league split. One of the leagues made it all glitzy with the whole WWF entrances and names."
AskUK,3d3844,How2999,2,Mon Jul 13 13:26:25 2015 UTC,"Darts is a pub game, so when you see it on TV, it's literally some labour club (though sometimes it in a football stadium function room)"
AskUK,3d3vtw,YharnamResident,21,Mon Jul 13 08:54:19 2015 UTC,"Of course, it's only natural to pick up sounds and such whilst living for an extended period of time in another area. I've known plenty of Americans and non Americans who have gone to study or live in another country and ended up with this hybrid accent.   Though the worst was an American (Boston) going to study in Middlesbrough and the next time I spoke to her... If Satan had an accent..."
AskUK,3d3vtw,kendo545,8,Mon Jul 13 09:04:48 2015 UTC,Yes. It's perfectly normal - because you hear the British accent most of the time your speech will gradually shift to sounding British.  But it likely won't go all the way without concious effort as it takes training to re-learn some of the parts of your speech that don't change easily.
AskUK,3d3vtw,collinsl02,7,Mon Jul 13 09:07:38 2015 UTC,"Is that what you might call a ""mid atlantic"" accent? You hear it in some celebrities (Naomi Campbell springs to mind) who has spent a lot of time between the two. It is quite normal."

AskUK,3d3vtw,ichliebekuchen,3,Mon Jul 13 10:47:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it happens.  I've got a friend who's gone the other way, he's now living in California from Liverpool and his accent is quite Americanised now.  It happens within the UK also - my Auntie is from Liverpool but has lived in Portsmouth for longer than she lived in Liverpool. If she speaks to a scouser they assume she's a southerner, people from down south would still swear she has a Scouse accent though."
AskUK,3d3vtw,neenoonee,2,Mon Jul 13 10:30:48 2015 UTC,You might still have your accent but have started pronouncing words in the British way. This ends up giving a some what strange result.  I actually find when I am working with Americans it's quite common if I am the only English person in the conversation to slip into using American pronunciation on some words as if they keep you using their pronunciation and you keep using yours it starts to feel like you are being stubborn by not adapting when you quite easily can. It almost feels like you are constantly trying to correct them if you don't adapt.  I worked with an English guy who had been working in New York for a few years and he using American pronunciation on all his words despite him still having an English accent and it sounds weird.  You realise there is something off about they way they speak but it's tricky to put your finger on quite what the issue is at first.  Of course where does a accent start and where does individual word pronunciation end is another question.
AskUK,3d3vtw,dvb70,2,Mon Jul 13 09:28:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty normal. I moved to the UK about 12 years ago for Uni, having grown up in the Middle East. My accent was originally a bastardisation of Aussie and American, now I've got a pretty strong Northern accent."
AskUK,3d3vtw,MDKrouzer,2,Mon Jul 13 11:52:40 2015 UTC,My friend lived in London for 12 years and had the broadest Aussie accent imaginable.  When she moved back home they thought she had an English accent.  She didn't.
AskUK,3d3vtw,the_real_grinningdog,2,Mon Jul 13 12:16:53 2015 UTC,"It's super normal. I think it would be abnormal if you didn't pick the accent in your immediate environment.  You also immigrated at a relatively young age, so the change is more expected (at 17 you're still learning and your brain is still growing). It's less common for older people to have their accents change drastically (I would say 30+ is where the cut off is), or it takes longer.  Your accent converges to the people around you because most of us, whether consciously or not, want to fit in with our environment, and accents are just one way of expressing that desire.  tl;dr Adapt or die. Or end up like Loyd Grossman."
AskUK,3d3vtw,redbowkiki,2,Mon Jul 13 13:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my missus (American, but lived over here for 15 years or so) constantly gets people asking where she's from. It's not so much that her accent has become mid-Atlantic but rather it's become British with a faint American twinge.

If you're not in a union, then join one! Also, your rights in this matter are partly determined by how long you've been working for your employer. I think it's back up to 2years now before the full employee protections kick in, but I'm not sure.  Realistically, if you're barred from driving it's likely to depend on how big the organisation is that you work for, and whether they're able to transfer you into a non-driving role until you've got the all-clear to drive again. If not, they may be able to fire you on capability grounds, as you're no longer able to perform an essential function of your job. But again, your union rep will have a better idea about all this than we will."

I'm inclined to just wait and see until I've had my follow up appointment with the doctors as I may be worrying over nothing, but it's really helpful to have an idea of potential outcomes.   Luckily the A and E doctors were reasonably satisfied that it was more likely to be a one-off hypoglycaemia thing rather than a neurological problem, but it's good to be prepared for whatever might happen"

Something similar happened to me, where I passed out without explanation. I'm a pilot, so clearly this would have affected my job.  Luckily for me, the doctors decided it was ""probably"" a choking episode which was a one-off (and made worse by some undiagnosed conditions that were treatable). The aviation authorities needed further tests done because ""probably"" wasn't good enough, but eventually I was cleared to fly again. My company just gave me paperwork to do until I was cleared to fly again.  I hope you're as lucky as me, but I completely understand the stress. Good luck."

AskUK,3d1nxw,Willeth,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:49 2015 UTC,Package offers also mean you're stuck with the same instructor even if you don't like him.

AskUK,3czrfw,redbowkiki,69,Sun Jul 12 06:55:32 2015 UTC,"Swearing in the US is definitely not non-existent, but my impression is that most American swearing is done out of anger and frustration, whereas most British swearing is conversational or for comic effect.  This is the same on both ends of the swearing spectrum.

Then at the other end of the spectrum, I've never heard an American call somebody a cunt without them putting considerable venom into it and I've literally never heard an American say it affectionately the way it can be used in the UK.  tl:dr - both countries swear, but the Americans take it more seriously"

I personally don't like cursing in a normal conversation, even with friends, unless it's slightly-harmless words like ""shit/shitty"" or once in a while ""fuck/fucking"" depending on the context.   I get that the word ""cunt/cunty/cuntish (lol)"" is a bit more normal here in the UK but it'd probably take me a decade to start even saying it myself, if ever there was a chance of me ""warming up"" to it. That's only because, as someone said, it's a more gender-aimed curse.  But in the US, it depends who you hang out with. Some groups of people will curse more. Others won't curse at all. With the uni and work colleagues I've been hanging out with in the UK, I would say the amount of casual cursing to be maybe like 15% more than in the US.

The NHS is not on this list as far as I am aware. But I'll outline the rest for completeness. If the employer can register they must advertise the job throughout the entire EU and they must demonstrate that they couldn't find anyone suitable to do the job.

While studying, I worked part-time as a flip-flop counter, where I was commended for my counting skills. Working as a Jelly Bean Counter would a perfect combination of my interests and experiences and where better to do that than for Company X, an organisation that has won the National Jelly Bean award three years in a row!  I am also attracted by the Cityville location of Company X headquarters and the opportunities for career progression within Company X in the future.

(I suppose excluding cars, major appliances, yachts,).  (Of course, you can usually find expensive, 'designer' versions of most manufactured stuff, but I am talking about the basic version of everything).  This is due to cheap production in huge volumes in offshore factories in China, combined with efficient distribution through retail giants such as Argos, Walmart, Carrefour, Amazon.  Services, and non-manufactured stuff, is where prices have risen.  Housing, education, taxes, healthcare, petrol, transport, food.  These have gone up in price much more than manufactured stuff."
AskUK,3cyv4o,full_of_grace,2,Sun Jul 12 11:47:26 2015 UTC,"This could be for a few reasons: Argos focus on value and therefore need to keep their prices pretty low, they might be able to produce their products more cheaply than in 1991 due to technology advances etc, or as they have become a bigger company they have more power over their suppliers and therefore buy their products for less. You can definitely see the effect of inflation if you look at other products, such as if you compare the price of a pint, a burger, sweets or a newspaper to 1991!"
AskUK,3cyv4o,TVKMarkII,4,Sun Jul 12 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"The basic principle is almost all resources are scarce, therefore supply decreases over time. If demand is stable (it's not) then the price for these resources will increase as the supply decreases, because there's less of it to go round.  Inflation is necessary as it encourages the consumer to purchase now (thus stimulating the economy) rather than delaying the purchase while waiting for the price to drop (which means the economy could go lax due to a lack of demand and monetary circulation).  Technology now plays a massive part and can affect it either way. The mass production of products can push the price down as supply can be increased quickly. However it can equally produce very high-tech things that are harder to mass produce but are in greater demand. The former will drag prices down at the lower end of the market, while the latter will push it up at the top end because demand is constant.!  But I think in all honesty the price brackets remain roughly the same (adjusted for inflation). The top of the range computers are Â£1,000+. Mid-range is Â£500-1000. Low spec are less than Â£500. But technology has simply moved on so the prices reflect that change (it would be rather silly to continue charging someone Â£1000 for a computer that isn't even on the same generational level as another, it wouldn't sell). Simply technology has moved on.   If you look at things less affected by cutting edge technology, say; petrol: the price has risen 50% since I can clearly remember it. A lot of the more ""basic"" products have risen in price while technological products have fallen, because the basic products are growing more scarce, while the technology ones are more powerful but using the same production techniques (roughly) so they reflect better value for money.   The other thing you have to consider is the relative prices. Which again works both ways."

Others have addressed a lot of points in detail here already,but here are a few points:  Globalisation has meant a lot of non-tech products are cheaper than they were a generation ago, but at some other cost e.g. good cheap clothes  + made in dodgy conditions in countries like Bangladesh. Similar with those duvet covers.  Some things in your examples- frying pans (non-stuck coating), and printing the pattern on the duvet cover- one does not think of as tech, but involve tech somewhere.

It's been a good few years since I've donated bras, and they were charities my friends were collecting for, so I don't remember which ones they were too well. But there definitely ARE legit charities out there.  A quick search came up with:  http://www.againstbreastcancer.org.uk/get-involved/fundraising/recycling/513/bra-recycling/  and http://bcrglobal.com/ sets up a few bra banks around the UK.  The general term for what you're looking for is 'bra bank'. If you search that with 'in [your location]', I guess something useful will pop up.  Hope I've helped. Sorry if I haven't.  EDIT: If all else fails and you don't mind the middle man getting involved, many, many, many charity shops in the UK take bras. Every charity shop I've volunteered for, regardless of what cause they donate the money to, accept bra donations."

It's easy for people to think, ""You're depressed because X, Y and Z"", but a lot of the time, X Y and Z were caused by the depression. It won't get better on its own. You won't magically become interested in things you aren't now. You're not lazy, you're ill. Please look into that, mental health problems almost never fix themselves and almost always get worse if ignored. The longer you leave it, the harder it will be to solve.  It might seem like I didn't answer your question but I think if you can sort the mental health problems you'll find it easier to find a job, or even create one for yourself.   Good luck."

AskUK,3cx8kg,narsty,9,Sat Jul 11 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"Don't compare how your friends look on the outside with how you feel on the inside. Careers are, for most people, overrated. In my limited experience if you talk to anyone who's been in a career for more than a dozen years they'll be bored and wish they could change.  I've talked to accountants who report that its ok but a bit dull, corporate lawyers who find the work soul destroying and I've yet to meet a happy teacher.  In fact my suspicion is that careers were invented by companies to make you willing to sacrifice your personal life for to work harder for the company.  So bearing that in mind, I would try and focus on jobs that provide enjoyment now and not worry too much about a career. It also sound like you've got the opportunity to try different things and fail as you'll be no worse of than you are now. You might also find that your parents are happier to have you around when they see you out and about trying to work.  As for what specifically to do, I've no great ideas. I'd be tempted to try running my own business rather than being an employee, even if its only being a suby for local builders whilst you work things out.  One final point: your life has not been wasted. Life isn't a competition to see who has the most toys by the time they retire. Focus on now, as its much more important than worrying about what sort of career you will have had by he time you retire.  Sorry I can't be more help."

AskUK,3cx8kg,darpich,2,Sat Jul 11 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the other poster who said you need to go to your doctor about your depression. It's clouding your judgement and decision making tools.  It is not a healthy response to hate your job so much that you just stop going until they sack you. Hating your job is more common (though always a shame) but being proactive about finding alternative while in work is healthier approach.   You do still have options, loads of them. Get yourself down to a local volunteering centre and try some things out, build up your range of experience but also your self worth and confidence.   I have a friend who started his own gardening business 3 years ago and now needs to hire in help to get all of his work complete. That's a good physical job, he gets to meet lots of people and help them out and he didn't need to train for it.   What do you think about working with people? A support role? In school, or college?  What about working in an admin role in an institution/organisation you respect? Maybe it will lead into things you can't imagine just now?  Very few careers involve someone saying ""right I'm going to be that"" and then going out and doing just that in a linear fashion. Some of the best careers come from trying something/anything and seeing what opportunities come up.   Good luck."
AskUK,3cx8kg,agnesb,2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was seeing my doctor for 10 months about it and was prescribed various medications which I took for months and months and I didn't show any improvement just tiredness. My doctor just keeps upping the amounts and doesn't seem to know what to do.  I just feel like I've messed my life up and didn't make the right choices. I hated my job for years but it finally came to a head in the last few months.  My problem is I don't know what I want to do. I want something I can enjoy, but I also need a job that pays enough. I'm 30 and have nothing, but I want what everyone else wants (a nice home, a car, holidays, a family etc). All of that seems so far off right now, sat here at my parent's home sat on a laptop. I just don't know what I want to do that pays enough and I enjoy."
AskUK,3cx8kg,MuchWittering,4,Sat Jul 11 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"You will only have messed your life up if you give up now. You're only 30, your life's not over yet, you're just taking a more complicated route towards your destination than some other people have. It's often said there's no such thing as a job for life these days, and for a lot of people that's probably true. As others have said, if you enjoy going to the gym, then gym instructor or personal trainer may be a good start, and you could look into studying physiotherapy part time to extend your skills into a more secure or higher paying role.  Also, as well as giving you you tasters of other jobs to see whether you like them, volunteering will give you extra experience and skills to put on your CV, and hopefully eventually at least one referee to say how wonderful they've found working with you. That will all come in handy once you're ready to be applying for jobs again. , so you won't have to use the boss that sacked you for a reference.  However, as everyone else has mentioned, you need to get your depression sorted out, and stop using drink as a crutch before you are going to be in a position to go back to work properly I think. Good luck!"
AskUK,3cx8kg,agnesb,2,Sun Jul 12 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"You should ask to see a different doctor and talk about other treatments. Drugs can work, but not for all. Talking therapies, but also behavioural can make massive differences.   It's good that you work out, lack of exercise can really compound issues.   Your depression is worth fixing though, you have every right to ask for a different doctor or to see a specialist.   I can understand your frustration, but 30 is still young enough to make changes and make your future different (or I hope so, 85 baby here too!)  The thing is, the things you want take work, time and effort. They don't come easy and often come with complications - this is both the great and bad thing about it.   I know you're keen on money, but you might need to start with working out what you want (and feeling better).  It's why I suggested volunteering, at the moment you're unemployed and so not earning. You still won't be earning but you'll be working out what you want to do (or don't want to do - important progression in your journey) and starting to feel better because doing something is better than nothing.   The end goal takes lots of somethings, some of them will work, some of them not. But it's progress.   This too shall pass."

AskUK,3cx8kg,Hitman__Actual,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you are looking for a job that would actually make a difference to something in the world. I'm searching for the same - I'm 37.   I hold down a okay/good job (Â£25k as a corporate trainer), but I've never felt ""needed"" by an employer, I just do tasks for money for bills.   The closest I've ever felt to being needed as a human was when my friend asked me to be Best Man for his wedding. I think that the problem with modern society is that jobs these days are simplified down specifically so that no one person is ""needed"" as that's a weak point in the profit making process, so we all have shitty replaceable jobs, which keeps us in our little box. That's my opinion, but it sounds like you're going through something similar. A lack of being needed for something.   One thing I would say is that, as a man, your shittiest decade is out of the way. At some point in the next few years, people will suddenly start looking to you as some sort of leader, just because you're a man. It's weird to explain, but people just give you respect.   It's not like a red carpet to heaven or anything, but you will get more social respect from people - or perhaps less shit from people would be more accurate. You probably do this unconsciously yourself - have a look at a small group of mid 20's men, then a small group of mid 30's men and compare them. The mid 20's men look like boys in comparison to the other group. You might go and ask the younger men directions as they're more approachable, or the older men as they're likely more knowledgable. That's the sort of change you'll experience soon."

The UK has a silly number of beers (there are over 1000 breweries, all with 3-5 regular beers and seasonal ones), so there is a very high possibility that none of the beers people recommend will be available.  However, just to tempt fate, I'd list my favourite breweries (who also make beers that I've seen abroad), as, Thornbridge, Dark Star, Brew Dog, Moorhouse, St Austell, Box Steam Brewery, Sharps.  Personally I'd avoid Innis and Gunn, its not that they're not nice, they are, its just that they're made for the export market, and rarely sold in the UK (although they are becoming increasingly common), also Newcastle Brown, its famous, but its just generic and London Pride (although people will probably dispute this).  But yeah, you need some direction!   Also, remember British Ales should be drunk at 'cellar temperature' which is 12C or 55F, so basically, not straight from the fridge!"
AskUK,3cuh5q,gruffi,3,Fri Jul 10 22:51:22 2015 UTC,UK was Innes & Gunn's first market. Source: I worked for the company that comissioned it.
AskUK,3cuh5q,hutchero,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:16:08 2015 UTC,"OK but that doesn't change the fact that it's a beer made to export. They focus on international markets with a strong link to Scotland i.e. Canada. I was in Canada for a few years and it is literally everywhere there, at the time I'd never even seen it in the UK. They get 70% of their revenues from abroad.  I like their beers, they're really good, but if you want to drink beer that people drink in Britain, you don't imo drink innis and Gunn."
AskUK,3cuh5q,Ivashkin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:27:52 2015 UTC,Been drinking it for years and it's fairly ubiquitous in off licenses
AskUK,3cuh5q,_The_Editor_,2,Sat Jul 11 09:52:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not anywhere near as ubiquitous as it is abroad.  That was my only point, let's not get hung up on this.   I don't see how you can argue that a company that exports 80% of its beer is not making beer for export markets. They're using the fact that they're Scottish to market their beer to people with Scottish ancestry. Which is a very clever idea. Because you know what migrants are like ""my dad was an eighth Scottish so the only beer I drink is proper scotch beer like Super Tennants, oh and this lovely traditional herbal drink called buckfast..."""

Not too expensive, and they were tasty. I'll try some other suggestions out next time. Might find myself in London again this year, and I'm no longer a poor uni student.

AskUK,3cuh5q,Mirrorkisser,7,Fri Jul 10 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"The decent stuff doesn't travel well   You do know that IPA stands for ""India Pale Ale"" and that it's a type of beer invented in the 19th century specifically to travel well? Britons in the Raj wanted beer, the local climate wasn't generally suitable for hop-growing, so brewers invented IPA specifically as a beer that would survive the six-week journey by sea.  So, unless you consider all IPAs to be crap, saying that decent British beer doesn't travel well is something of a contradiction."
AskUK,3cuh5q,neenoonee,-1,Sat Jul 11 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"Whilst that's true, a modern IPA is different in many ways to older stuff, not least strength.

With the government wanting 50% or more people to attend university it means that people with below average intelligence are on a degree course. As a result universities have dumbed down their courses. I know this as I was a scientific consultant to the university of Hull. The HNC has not been dumbed down.

The film is sort of okay. The Stephen Fry bits are great, which surprised me as they were furthest from the book, but the ending was bollocks. Even today a crowd like that would just be stomped on by the police, so the message about how to succeed against an oppressive system is a bit arse really."

Most Oxford undergrads and former undergrads who I work with are normal professional people who are completely cool with non-Oxbridge people working with them.  Of course you make more connections during undergrad at college, but you're still making connections as a post-grad. Likewise there are some massive wankers who do look down on people who didn't go to Eton and didn't undergrad here. They tend to sit in their corner and get ignored by everyone who isn't a total cockwomble."

Yes you'll probably make more ""connections"" during undergrad than postgraduate in as much as you'll meet more people that way.   That said the majority of undergrads I met were perfectly sound, normal people and certainly having a postgrad from there has helped me a lot, even if it is in a totally unrelated field"
AskUK,3cq7ex,hutchero,3,Fri Jul 10 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"Long ago, when I was a student, the routines of student life meant that undergraduates tended to hang out with other undergraduates and postgraduates with postgraduates.   Therefore one met them in contexts e.g. sport, where there was already some other common ground.  I would tend to agree that people would do postgrad degrees for for academic reasons, but as far as connections go, that is also a combination of a) some people already have connections through school and those diffuse into student friendships, b) undergrad life is more intense and occurs at a particularly formative time, c) maybe balances have shifted, but for sure even a generation ago, there were more foreign postgrads than undergrads, and irrespective of their English, they would have a totally different set of social and cultural backgrounds.

AskUK,3coggd,Mossley,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think the root cause was starting secondary school. She was bullied a lot in primary school, so when it came to picking a secondary school I picked one a little further away where few people from her primary were going. She hasn't been bullied there - and as a result has gained a lot of confidence and gone from someone very shy and withdrawn into someone very bold and outgoing. Unfortunately this is starting to come out as cockiness, rudeness, and misbehavior, playing up to others to be the class clown."
AskUK,3coggd,carmen_verandah,3,Thu Jul 9 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Then I can see where this is coming from. She is taking this opportunity, as an 'unknown', to cultivate a new and 'harder', popular identity.  What you really need to do, if you ask me, is reinforce that her 'old' personality/attitude wasn't the problem, it was that others put her in a box and wouldn't let it go. Now she's in a new and bigger school, she has the opportunity to find people who like her as she is. There will be people who like who she is (unless she's a complete arse, which I doubt)  I apologise for the parenting advice, but I have recent experience of a teen going to a new school, because the kids at her old school put her in a box and wouldn't let her be anything else. She seems to have found some (a few, as yet, but it's encouraging) who are willing to give 'who she is', a chance.  Best of luck."
AskUK,3coggd,carmen_verandah,3,Thu Jul 9 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"When you think about emotional detriment Vs emotional toil, it makes sense to be class clown.

I'm not defending her actions, but I can see where a teen might be coming from."
AskUK,3coggd,carmen_verandah,2,Thu Jul 9 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Nay, she's not a complete arse. A bit of an arse, yes, but then I suppose we all are.  Until she started at this school she was very well behaved. A bit wimpy maybe, but one of those kids who would spend all her pocket money on sweets for other people, and could be guaranteed to stand up for other people. In fact, even at this school, in between the detentions, she got a lot of praise for getting in between a group of boys who were physically attacking another boy, and daring them to hit a girl, which put an end to it. (This happened out of school on the bus, and the boys parents came into school to make the teachers aware.)  I've calmed down quite a lot from my anger when I posted earlier, and when she got home (an hour late due to a detention) I didn't shout at her, and did make a point of saying that whilst I was happy that she was more confident I wasn't happy with all the ways she was choosing to display it.  I did still make her write an essay about the attacks, with an apology note for holding up the I am boring sign during the silence, to hand in to her teachers tomorrow - I want them to know I'm taking it seriously, and indeed for her to know the same. And she has still lost her phones for the remainder of the school term, as well as severely reduced computer and TV privileges. She still won't be having a big birthday party as we had planned, but I have decided that IF she gets no more detentions in that period AND her teachers confirm her behaviour has improved I may let her have a couple of friends sleep over.  I've also arranged to have a meeting at the school regarding their detention policy. At the moment incidents are logged in a book, and then passed on to one member of staff in charge of detentions, with detentions sometimes not being booked in for up to a week after an incident - I think in part this is contributing to the problem as by the time she has a detention, and I've been informed she has one, she's forgotten what its for in the first place. You wouldn't train a dog not to take a shit on the carpet if you randomly shouted at it a week after the event, after all! At the very least, they do need to be calling me if she misbehaves so that I can tackle the issue immediately she gets home."

I like the looks of it, seats are the most comfortable I've ever sat in, buckets of torque from the noisy pedal and a load of low-down grunt so it feels like a fast car in the rev range you'd usually drive it, fairly nimble feeling from the steering wheel, returns decent mpg (averaging 50mpg), has a big fuel tank for long trips (about 750-800 miles from a full tank), has a big boot that my dog fits into comfortably, has a lovely cabin with nice quality dash area etc., and of course it's an Alfa...   I don't like, the noise the engine makes.. No getting away it sounds like a clattery bag of spanners... Nowt wrong with it, just these early 4-pot JTD engines have always and will always sound clattery.... Suspension needs constant attention because Alfa/Fiat cheaped out on it, hence bushes wear out, arms squeak, and the springs/shocks are so poorly matched it feels both wallowy and hard/crashy at the same time... the swirl flaps on the inlet manifold are know to detach themselves and grenade the engine and/or turbo.... the quality of the underseal seems to depend entirely on which shift were working in the  factory in Itally when it was built, hence you can get one with a top seal job that'll outlast the car, and some that have completely rotted through in 5 years.... my local trusted specialist is a 90 min drive away... the paint seems to be one step up from butter on the hardness scale, so it's peppered in stone chips... there's wind noise and squeaking from the frameless door/window seals... Alfa pre-installed at least 5 unidentifiable rattles in every car (between the dash and the tailgate usually)....

I can easily do three or four hour trips without any trouble, and it has a surprisingly good turning circle, which is handy for parking.   Acceleration is maybe a little slow, but I don't mind, and because it was a Kia I could get a used one with a way better mileage than the other Fords/VWs/Peugeots in my price range. Honestly, I bought it to transport my English Setter back and forth to the office every day and to drive him to shows, and he's got tonnes of room in the boot to lie down and move around.   Downsides is that it's definitely not very good on the mileage, and because it's Korean it has a pedal brake instead of a handbrake, and a weird little lever-release thing underneath the dashboard. The indicators/windscreen washers are also switched around which drives me nuts when I'm borrowing another car for a day as I'm forever flicking the wipers on when I want to turn left."

Had it for 2 years and I am really happy with it. MPG is good (I average 55 to 60 on my daily commute along the M1) and it costs me about 50-60 quid to fill the tank from almost empty. I love the dashboard design and layout of the instruments and the build quality feels solid.  In terms of driving, the throttle is responsive and even at higher speeds you can still squeeze some more acceleration out of it. It is a bit slower to accelerate in the first gear without really putting your foot all the way down, but being a diesel it's never going to be fast off the mark anyway. Ride is a little bit bumpy and can get quite alarming on poor road surfaces.  From a practicality point of view, I really love this car. The boot is massive especially when you fold the back seats down completely. I'm a drummer so you can imagine how much gear I have to carry and it all fits very comfortably in my car.  Maintenance wise I've only had one major cost so far which was replacing a cracked exhaust manifold. I do a lot of miles (50k in the last 2 years) so I take her in for service roughly every 6 months.  Edit: Forgot to mention, that what I don't like is the fact that I don't have a USB or AUX input.

Bought it from a lady who used it very rarely, she had it from new and had only done 49,000 miles in it, the most she did in one year was like 3,500! As my first car it's perfect, I paid Â£800 for it and it's mechanically in perfect condition, full service history and it just passed it's MOT with no advisories. My Dad says that it drives very solidly for an almost 25 year old car.  The only bad things I would say are lack of comforts, electric windows or A/C, but that doesn't bother me that much. The main 'issue' is that there is a lot of lacquer peel on it, and annoyingly there's a bit on pretty much every panel. The local sprayer quoted me Â£1200 for a full respray, and while I would love to get it done, it is a lot of money to 'fix' something that doesn't affect the drive.  Anyone in here looking for a first car, I'd definitely recommend one, I'm 23, been driving since the start of the year and my insurance was Â£1064 (third party fire and theft). I'm a guy and was expecting Â£1500+ so I was thrilled at that. Just make sure you take the time to find a good condition one. The same can be said for any car, but don't just drop Â£400 or whatever on one that's done a gazillion miles. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to get a shit car as your first one, just be patient and be prepared to travel a bit to find a good condition car."
AskUK,3cnwxd,votingprawn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"My girlfriends Peugeot 106 1.1.  What do I like? It's bizarrely fun to drive. It's slow, but doesn't 'feel' as slow as you'd expect for a 1.1. It's not got power steering and as most of my driving is done on rural roads, it's as close to a road going gokart in steering feel as you can realistically get. The girlfriends father owns one of them fancy Audi's pushing 450bhp and a proper 'British sports car', the peugeot even puts a smile on his face! It's horn is on the end of the indicator stork which is nothing but a constant delight as well. Gets fair mileage even with with how I drive, can't complain about that. It's a terrible piss poor colour with black bumpers, yet somehow that seems to please people as well.   What don't I like? It's small though to be fair it always shocks people as to how much crap you can pile into it with the seats down. The biggest issue with it's size is the fact the steering wheel isn't adjustable and the pedals are stupidly close together, I only just fit in it, even then I can't comfortably rest my right leg when in 5th gear... The electrics occasionally just don't give a fuck and do whatever they feel like, though to be fair as I understand it this Peugeot is actually doing pretty well on that front. It's noisy on the motorway but it's perfectly happy to sit there at 70-80mph with no problem. The throttle response is superb, though sometimes it does stutter when you apply power to quickly. It struggles up some hills, though to be fair my drive to work does involve a 25% incline so on normal hills it's fine.   But to be honest with you - I love it. I'd love a faster car and I know the 106 is fairly crap, but for 'car people' any car is a joy and I genuinely believe that.  Where I grew up the buses are crap and having that freedom of being able to ship my mum and dad to the shops (neither of them can drive.) without having to stand about for hours for buses is great.   It's my first car and bless my girlfriend, I've basically taken it as my own. Though she's very kind in terms of how often I use it compared to her so I've got to thank her for that!"

Economy is not bad at 35 mpg. Expect I'd say different if I drove it daily instead of once a week.  Sadly it's becoming a maintenance and repair hog. Something that old, stuff just fails no matter how thoroughly you look after it. It's just had two new brake callipers, the clutch spring is on the way out, I think the exhaust is falling off and rust is creeping in. One fix at a time.

Whilst it's not unreasonable for him to assume there wouldn't be a claim, they've got him on that point.   They should have called him as soon as the claim came in, and didn't, and for this, Â£200 seems like a reasonable (if not slightly generous) figure for compensation, but given that he hasn't got his car and they didn't have any evidence to say that the taxi wasn't damaged, they aren't wrong in saying it wasn't a claim to defend.   I'd say it's not one to argue any further, accept the compensation and the increased premium, and take it as a life lesson.

Unfortunately there aren't going to be too many employers looking for enthusiastic junior swift programmers at the movement.  I would stick to developing a project in PHP, Python, Java or something like that. Then upload to GitHub and stick the link to your GitHub on your CV. You could even just follow a tutorial which guides you every step of the way and then tweak the results. Anything relevant will be good."
AskUK,3cnqvl,G_P_R,2,Thu Jul 9 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Keep any examples you build, even a hello world one. These are the sort of things you can roll out and point to when saying you can code in the language.  Also keep in mind what tom808 says below, it might be harder for you to break back in to an area where there aren't as many jobs. I think the two most popular are the .net languages (VB, C#) and of course the competing web technologies php, Java.  If you don't know php already its very easy to learn and very very popular"
AskUK,3cnqvl,justNickoli,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:31:13 2015 UTC,"I've taught very basic PHP at A-Level before, I think I'd rather get back into C# to be honest, I'm hoping going through the MicrosoftVirtualAcademy videos will enable me to create a few sample apps."
AskUK,3cnqvl,Moominpappa,4,Sat Jul 11 12:25:06 2015 UTC,It may be worth looking into other qualifications/certifications that are more specific and/or quicker to achieve.
AskUK,3cnqvl,Moominpappa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:13:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think I'll do that. Does anyone know what's worth while? There's so many distance learning sites these days it's hard to know what's worth it.
AskUK,3cnqvl,jaynoj,3,Thu Jul 9 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"Firstly - G_P_R is absolutely correct that if you have a portfolio of work you've done in your own time, you'll have a huge leg up over a lot of people, even those with actual experience in the industry.  Secondly - I work at a software house and a lot of the graduates we take on have a maths or physics background rather than a degree in CS, and a reasonable number have exactly 0 actual programming experience. I know it's not quite the same, but strictly in terms of experience  and qualifications I wouldn't have thought it would be a barrier - I kind of get the feeling however that someone who is trying to change career might be viewed with suspicion, rightly or wrongly.  I will say that we basically never take on people who apply directly and only ever arrange interviews via agencies. Not all companies will be the same obviously, but I know if someone emails us a CV in it'll end up at the bottom of a pile somewhere unless it's truly exceptional.   Did you do an MSc full or part time while still supporting yourself? Any tips?   Not done it myself, but I know a few people who did part time MScs and they didn't have too much trouble. The workload was fairly high though and they had to be quite driven, and at times they did need to take a few days out of work to get stuff together."
AskUK,3cnqvl,jaynoj,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for a great answer. I hadn't thought about how my career switching comes across so I'll consider that when I do my CV again.  I don't think I'm that out of date. C#, Java and HTML haven't changed that much, but that was what the few people I still know in industry said to me."
AskUK,3cnqvl,jaynoj,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"Nah, not really. At least, they haven't changed to the extent that anyone who knew them at one point will be out of their depth now anyway.  If you want to go into web dev though it's probably useful to brush up on your javascript."
AskUK,3cnqvl,ThinkBritish,3,Thu Jul 9 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in software engineering and has qualifications in Electronic Engineering (HNC), I would say no, don't bother going back to Uni to get your masters if you want to get back into software. All your going to do is get yourself into debt, most likely.  You already have a degree in CompSci, and the basic principles in programming haven't changed that much.  I would agree that taking on some projects in your personal time and putting them on GitHub would be a smart move. You could also get involved in some open source projects.  Grab a copy of CodeComplete and read it. It will refresh your mind and put you in good stead and build your confidence.  Also, learn web technologies. HTML for sure, and javascript. A lot of stuff is web based now, even corporate applications. You could also learn mobile, android and iOS development which is in demand.  If you want to go into enterprise/corporate line of work, you can't go wrong with learning C-sharp and the .Net framework. There is a lot of call for people with these skills and the job market is good. You can sit some microsoft exams if you want to prove you're serious about it and I would say they're more use than a masters right now.  I would also recommend the CleanCode videos. They're based around Java, but the principles are language agnostic to be fair. You can erm, <cough>, erm, find them online if you know where to look. The videos go over stuff like unit testing, dependency injection and all the SOLID principles which if you know and understand, will go a long way.  You may also want to have a read up on Agile programming, SCRUM and that sort of thing."

AskUK,3cp62p,dayofthenoose,10,Thu Jul 9 17:30:35 2015 UTC,You definitely need to ask your doctor again. Take in your list of repeat prescriptions and ask her to go through one by one what each one is for. If she is vague tell her if she cant explain why you need then they're obviously not necessary and that you'll stop taking them.  Sometimes people end up on a lot of medications that even the doctors aren't sure why. Its good to go through the list every so often and check its all ok.
AskUK,3cp62p,Lozzy1256,3,Thu Jul 9 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Your GP might be treating symptoms rather than a single condition. (This is fair enough, sometimes.

AskUK,3cnnc0,woolypumpkin,3,Thu Jul 9 08:48:33 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you're good for going to Canada.  Firstly, basically everyone has got a speeding ticket at one point in their life, the only time I would be a bit worried is if you're less than 2 years after passing your test, if that is the case you have to redo your test on 6 points, so basically, don't get another one!   Secondly, you don't seen to know what you've been given, but based on what the police officer told you, you will receive a fixed penalty notice, you're not being prosecuted, its not a criminal record or a driving offence, or conviction or anything, you don't have to declare it on job applications! Its a fixed penalty notice, nothing more, you get the same thing for parking on double yellows, read this  I've applied for a few Canadian work permits and when you're applying they will ask you to do an ACRO police check.   I am 99% certain that fixed penalty notices do not show up on this (I had one when I got mine and it didn't appear), but even if they do, they won't give a shit, its a speeding ticket, they're interested in DUIs and things. On an enhanced CRB it might appear, but also no one cares.  In terms of insurance, you can find out how much it'll be just go on comparethemarket or something, and add a speeding ticket and see what the difference is. I don't think you have to tell the insurance company until your insurance is renewed though, I certainly haven't, I guess check the T&Cs, don't tell them if you can avoid it.   You'll probably be looking at about Â£50-Â£100 extra on your insurance in the first year, roughly halving every year after that. I last got one in 2012 and I think it added Â£60, I was 26, I think it impacts your insurance more if you're younger, my dad had one when he was 50 or so and it only added about Â£10."

Apparently my insurer matches up comparison site quotes to their existing policies to look for fraud.

If you go online and get ten quotes with slightly different details but with some info left the same to link them, they will query whether you have tried to manipulate the system, to give false details for a cheaper policy. It won't mean they won't offer you a policy or will amend the price they quote, but it might be that they ask you for evidence to confirm that the set of personal information that you finally landed on when taking out the policy is indeed accurate.   It's a pretty sensible anti-fraud measure."

AskUK,3cnnc0,formerwomble,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"It might be a bit early for you to tell - but are you definitely being prosecuted for the offence? Is a speed awareness course on the cards?  I don't know for certain if it would affect your move to Canada - but with a lot of things of this ilk, the worst thing to do is to not disclose it. Being seen to hide things is the worst thing you can do in something like this.  And yes, if you get points, you'll have to tell your insurance company. Most companies don't want to know if you went on a course though, with the exception of Admiral."
AskUK,3cnnc0,pinebarren,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:52:13 2015 UTC,"The officer never mentioned a speed awareness course at all.. just handed my a little piece of card, took my license and pretty much told me to slow down.. that's it.. never mentioned any options.. who would I contact to see about the speed course?"
AskUK,3cnnc0,Lucifa42,2,Thu Jul 9 08:58:51 2015 UTC,"What does the card say exactly? Did the officer actually use any words that suggested you were being prosecuted, fined, or would incur points on your licence?"
AskUK,3cnnc0,MDKrouzer,2,Thu Jul 9 09:08:02 2015 UTC,Yeah he said that I'd be getting a Â£60 fine and three points and the card says the same thing. To be honest I know it's not the end of the world but I'm terrified that my insurance is gonna sky rocket (paying Â£1000 a year as is!) and that my eligibility for working in Canada next year will be affected!  In fairness it was a straight road and i was doing 59 in a 40 zone.. nobody sticks to the 40 in this area (not making excuses just saying) so i don't think the course applies to me :(
AskUK,3cnnc0,MDKrouzer,2,Thu Jul 9 09:16:57 2015 UTC,for a speed awareness course you usually only get them if you're going a little over the limit.

Do check your insurance t&c to see if you are required to tell them about the points when you get them.

AskUK,3cmbv7,Lozzy1256,2,Thu Jul 9 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"If you book well in advance and reserve your seats it's usually very cheap and comfortable. And you'll have Snowdonia the Welsh borders, the Lakes and the Scottish Borders for scenery. Be sure to specify a window seat!   Looking online there are a million different ways to make the journey. Given the choice I think the Virgin and Arriva routes changing at Chester or Crewe would be nicest. Chester is a nice historic place with Roman ruins and stuff if you fancied breaking your journey up. I would avoid going via London unless there's a big saving.    Also wrt to booking you can often save a lot by booking each leg of your journey individually. It's ridiculous but such is life. The drawback there is your are beholden to the train you booked at that specific time. Fuck up and you're fucked."

AskUK,3cnyws,the_vig,3,Thu Jul 9 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's possible the OP meant the UK. Anyway I had a quick look at the 2011 census results - if the number of mixed-race athletes reflected the number of mixed-race people in the population as a whole, then you would expect:   For the UK, 1 in every 87 British athletes to be mixed-race. For England, 1 in every 54 English athletes to be mixed-race. For Wales, 1 in every 101 Welsh athletes to be mixed-race. For Scotland, 1 in every 227 Scottish athletes to be mixed-race. For Northern Ireland, 1 in every 303 Northern Irish athletes to be mixed-race.   Whether the number of ""sports stars"" who are mixed race is more or less than these figures is left as an exercise for the reader."
AskUK,3cnyws,GaryJM,2,Thu Jul 9 14:52:21 2015 UTC,Really? I'd suspect black and mixed race people are disproportionately represented in sports compared to Asians in this country.
AskUK,3cnyws,AberStans,2,Thu Jul 9 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"But are they over represented, or are Asian people under represented?"
AskUK,3cnyws,the_vig,4,Thu Jul 9 13:56:23 2015 UTC,Both. There are 5% black or mixed and 7% Asian in this country.  Then again it's pretty sport specific. Black people in cricket are pretty rare whereas they are definitely overrepresented in football.
AskUK,3cnyws,AberStans,-4,Thu Jul 9 14:02:01 2015 UTC,I think it's fairly obvious to anyone who follow UK sports that mixed race people are over-represented among English athletes.

AskUK,3cjenf,Thestolenone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:37:34 2015 UTC,Yes. I think TTD doesn't usually have equivalent branded products though.
AskUK,3cjenf,MsEtheldreda,4,Wed Jul 8 17:47:07 2015 UTC,I think I'm being thick here... I don't think I've ever seen non-supermarket brand meat other than duck / goose (and maybe whole turkey?)  Or do you mean you only buy meat from your local butcher?
AskUK,3cjenf,rtrs_bastiat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"Soup, it is really hard to find decent tinned soup that isn't gloopy and vile (I like fairly thin, brothy vegetarian soups). Also shampoo but I have evil hair that needs special treatment. I usually buy branded toothpaste too as it is usually on special offer and I know and trust it. Oh and Asian aisle tinned pulses as they are cheaper than own brand."
AskUK,3cjenf,MsEtheldreda,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:16:10 2015 UTC,I think its hard to find any soup which isn't crap now.  The main reason to buy Big Soup used to be that it was actually chunky. Nowadays it's mostly water though and you have to pack it with extra vegetables and meat.

AskUK,3cjyrd,prettyvac4nt,5,Wed Jul 8 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking tenancy agreements run until midnight, so if you agreed to move out on the 6th you would actually have possession until 11:59pm. Typically though you would hand you key over before that because not everyone is around until that time - having the landlord doorstep you though hastening your departure is highly unusual. The fact it happened is extremely unprofessional and either the result of a bad letting agent, a bad landlord, or a serious screw up. Regardless I would suggest you first of all read your letting agreement and probably get some professional advice.  On the one had cleaning was your responsibility. If you agreed to move out earlier you should have taken it into account. On the other hand the landlord has moved in possibly before they were supposed to (even if by hours). With no final inspection they also can't prove some of the damage/mess was yours. For example the landlord could have moved items around when he moved in. Depending on the professional advice I would also consider disputing any deductions made to the deposit with your deposit protection scheme (details of how to do this should have been given to you shortly after moving in, they are probably with your copy of the letting agreement).  Edit: Also do a Google search along the line of ""what can be deducted from my deposit"" or ""unfair deposit deductions"". If you letting agent/landlord are on the sketchy side they may try and hit you with some deductions which are not allowed."
AskUK,3cjyrd,sometimesihelp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've discussed it over with my boyfriend and we agreed that as the landlords took possession of the property before our tenancy ended, they accepted the level of cleanliness as it was - we did explain there was still cleaning to do, he went ahead and took the keys back anyway. I'm prepared to allow a deduction for carpet cleaning however any deductions for leaves behind the bin/general cleanliness we will dispute (I did offer to stay and scrub the oven and shower, he did not want me to). Thanks for the advice :)"
AskUK,3cjyrd,sometimesihelp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:52:27 2015 UTC,It was not clear if you already had some place else lined up but if you do not I would stay clear of that letting agent.  I also just realised my penchant for misspelling 'your' as just 'you' :)

AskUK,3cjyrd,hoffi_coffi,2,Thu Jul 9 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"Based on what you have said, I also would have interpreted that to mean you have until the end of Monday, with the property being available for occupation first thing Tuesday morning"

They asked if we would be willing to move out much earlier and they would refund our rent and they would be flexible on the deposit - that worked out with us so yes, great. Then exactly what you described, they went into detail about stuff that needed doing. Win / win for them, they got us out, a professional clean, all without having an empty house over christmas and new year.   Edit - make sure you catalague and photograph everything you can. You are being reasonable here, I am not sure what they are doing was even legal."

AskUK,3ckf58,stickywizard,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"It probably won't have a massive bearing on house prices in general, as those who own property already don't do it (largely) for the tax relief - it's a nice additional thing on the side, as it were. There's also other ways of owning property that this won't have a bearing on.   At the moment, if you're a higher rate tax payer (45% band), then for every Â£100 that you're charged in interest, you're actually just paying Â£55 (100-45) due to the tax break. What the change will mean is that this changes to costing you Â£80 instead, so the higher rate tax payers are 'losing' Â£25 per 100. Those on the 40% band are going to lose Â£20 per 100, and basic rate payers will remain the same.  I don't think it's going to have a huge bearing - I've got a second property and the change is going to mean a cost of around 400 quid a year, so not a big difference in the grand scheme of things. The other side of this is that it could see rents increase to try and capture the loss that way for landlords that are running things close to the wire."

AskUK,3cgi8c,bachus2015,90,Tue Jul 7 18:57:42 2015 UTC,"Hi, employability advisor here; I have created loads of CVs for clients.  Your CV is bit too wordy! No recruiter is going to wade through paragraphs and paragraphs.. they're on a really strict time limit with maybe 100+ CV's in front of them   You  Need To  Have Bullet Points   I'd have something like:    Employer  Job Title  Date (Right justified)  Short, two sentence max blurb summarising what you did (one line max)  Bullet points of key skills and responsibilities   Have you ever been involved in projects during work that showcase your skills, trustworthyness, etc etc? You can add in a Projects section and detail these for some extravalue. You also don't have a Skills section; a recruiter isn't gonna wade through two pages to see if you match the table of attributes they have in front of them: add in a short section detailing your major skills. Use examples so it doesn't seem too generic but keep it really short and to the point.  How are you applying to jobs, anyway? It's pretty rare for job adverts to just accept CVs these days... most employers that have an online application process that require a Personal Statement. Your work history paragraphs on your current CV are perfect for those types of things; they usually want fairly lengthy paragraphs detailing your role (it's just not appropriate for a CV).   Probably the most important part of online job applications is the Personal Statement section. Here is your time to shine: its basically like the covering letter of old; your putting a bit of personality and context into the application. If you have a Job Description from the advert at hand (and most jobs tend to.. maybe not for low level stuff but, they should at least have a few paragraphs on the job advert page detailing what the job is about) then the Personal Statement area is where you bang through all the keyskills/job requirements/specifications, showing for each and every one how you meet this. If there isn't a full formal Job Description, then use the paragraphs mentioned previously to talk about how you fit each and every attribute they are describing.   USE EXAMPLES! This is the most important thing of all, really. Anyone can say they are, for instance, 'excellent with people with a high standard of customer service'. But what recruiters need is evidence of this, so explain why you're good at customer service, and what you've done in work/personal experience that shows this.  If your applying for a job that doesn't have an online application form, or is missing a Personal Statement section, then use a covering letter to detail all of the above.  Also, you should personalise each application/CV/covering letter to the specific job you are applying to. usually this only requires a few changes here and there, but a really good tip is to research the company online: they usually have an About Us or Corporate section, or maybe even a mention in the media. Slot this into your application! Is there mention of a Corporate Plan, or training/qualification opportunities for staff, or maybe they fund community charity events.. how many stores/locations/offices do they have, how many employers? When were they founded? Recruiters fucking love this: it shows you CARE and are INTERESTED in the company, that you've done the 15 minutes of effort to do some research. It'll really stand you out from other candidates.  But back to your CV; you said you're applying for mainly minimum wage type jobs in retail and bars: ironically you might seem overqualified for these types of roles, so I'd recommend pairing down your CV to the essential skills, qualities, and experience that match the job in question. Applying for a bar job? Add in examples on how you've dealt with conflict, how your fast and flexible to work, with good maths/money skills. Remember examples. Hell I'd say for these types of jobs you can probably do the entire CV on one page. (this advice also applies if you're doing an online application, keep it really to the point).  Other advice: don't include your birthdate, nationality on the CV. Obviously this is fine if the online application form asks for these. Is your email address professional? I've had clients with lovesboobs13@hotmail.co.uk as their 'professional' email address. If the online application form says not to include CVs, don't fucking include a CV.  Hope that helps!"
AskUK,3cgi8c,NervousEnergy,7,Tue Jul 7 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, legendary reply there.  Are bullet points really something employers prefer on a CV? To me it just seems lazy but I also see your point that it is ""to the point"" and easier to read.  All of my jobs so far have been reactive type jobs, not really project or achievement based. I can't say something like I achieved 110% of my sales target for the year (which would look fine as a bullet point) when I worked in the police or in retail, it would be more like:   Responding to emergency 999 calls from members of the public Years of experience as a trained first aider Experience of communicating with members of the public in a wide variety of large scale events such as the 2012 Olympics   Would it be acceptable to write it in that way?"
AskUK,3cgi8c,NervousEnergy,13,Tue Jul 7 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"The key thing really is time: a recruiter is looking through [x] CV's a minute, and simply doesn't have time to read through paragraphs. Its just not feasible, and as annoying as it sounds lengthy paragraphs do more to detract from your CV than add to it.   With someone with extensive employment history like you, I'm a fan of sectioning out your periods of employment into specific roles. Here's a link to a section from my work-in-progress CV (work-in-progress because I thought I'd have to get a new job but didn't in the end, so never actually finished it. It's a bit rough still, for instance the font choice is a bit shit.)  Hopefully you can see that it's short and snappy and really to the point. The time to expand on all that is the interview or the online application, not the CV. Again, for online applications, you can pretty much use all of your written paragraphs in it. My employment history sections for online applications are about 500 - 800 words each where I go into real detail.  There is an argument to make that online applications should be pretty wordy; not only because online is easier to digest that paper, but also because HR software searches for keywords to match against [Job specification], so the more keywords you put in the more matches you might have. However, low level jobs probably don't have this type of software.  Now, I work with clients who have learning difficulties or zero employment history or qualifications, so my usual advice isn't very relevant for someone with your background. However..  Projects could include your specific examples of policing the Jubilee and Olympics; you can go into a bit more depth here on the specific things you had to do for these events that set you apart from your colleagues, and how you dealt with exceptional circumstances.   I'm guessing you were trained in handling 999 calls and such; you might even want to add a Training section detailing the formal training you took part in in-work. That kind of stuff backups some of the statements you've made."

You're right, if it's an online application where more a more detailed explanation of each role is asked for/required I can expand into paragraphs then, but as you and others have said, if a recruiter has dozens of CVs to browse, bullet points are the way forward.  I'll rewrite my CV later with bullet points which should reduce my paragraphs by half and make it more readable."

AskUK,3cgi8c,captain_ramshackle,8,Tue Jul 7 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"What a brilliant reply you've received!   Are bullet points really something employers prefer on a CV?   The earlier reply said:   they're on a really strict time limit with maybe 100+ CV's in front of them   This is really, really important. In a previous job where I had some responsibility for recruitment, I managed to lose a tax disk, and had to go to he DVLA office to get it replaced. I took a stack of 50 CVs with to read while I was standing in the queue. That gives you an idea of the amount of attention each CV got on the initial pass. You need to make it really stand out that I ought to take a more detailed look, otherwise I simply don't have time to look at each CV in detail. Bullet points are a great way of doing this. Not the only way, but highly recommended.  Good luck!"

AskUK,3cgi8c,DrHydeous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm not a recruiter but I am responsible for hiring my team and working with my colleagues to review CVs.  What I'm looking for   Skills - bullet pointed list which covers what the job ad is looking for Relevant qualifications - for the role (if applicable) e.g. technical qualifications Experience - Jobs split into a sentence or two to describe them then 3-4 bullet points listing key points/skills which are relevant to the role   Finally your qualifications  I really don't want to have to read much text. In the initial pass I'm probably going spend 2-3 minutes scanning your CV to see if it gets put on the 'for further consideration pile'.  Pretty much every CV I've gone onto interview has been because in the first 30-60 seconds I saw relevant skills & experience and knew that this was worth considering."
AskUK,3cgi8c,Exwind,0,Wed Jul 8 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"Are bullet points really something employers prefer on a CV?   No, not always. I have only rarely received a surfeit of bullet points instead of a proper CV, mostly from recent immigrants from the US where I understand that this practice is a lot more common. I tend not to employ people who do that, because a list of bullet points doesn't supply the information I'm looking for.  This may vary by industry. In my industry (the engineering side of IT) we tend to get only a handful of CVs for each vacancy so taking the time to actually read CVs isn't a great hardship."

AskUK,3cgi8c,that-there,10,Wed Jul 8 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"UPDATE  So having read a lot of the excellent advice here, I've rejigged my CV a little with bullet points. Cut down a bit of the text and focused more on what I achieved/demonstrated in each job rather than just a ""blah blah"" general overview. Still think I could cut it down a little but it's a start.  Also, I changed one of the sub-headings from 'Qualifications' to 'Personal Skills & Qualities' and bullet pointed general qualities I've demonstrated.  The personal profile/introduction bit at the start on my old CV is still on the new one, I just can't fit it all on a JPEG! Also kept my education history, just again couldn't fit it all on a JPEG..  PAGE 1 (new CV): http://s3.postimg.org/vrdheyopf/V2_PAGE1.jpg  PAGE 2 (new CV): http://s17.postimg.org/z2n8l8wy7/V2_PAGE2.jpg  Thanks especially to u/NervousEnergy who wrote some really good advice. I know it's still a bit wordy but it's definately an improvement over the last one.  I know someone mentioned put something in there to make the reader get an idea of the ""person"" behind it, but everywhere I've read says putting hobbies/interests etc is a waste of time unless it relates specifically to the job and it would take up extra space on the 2 pages which is already pretty limited!"
AskUK,3cgi8c,Exwind,3,Tue Jul 7 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Much better! My only real suggestion is to move Skills and Qualities to the first page, just below the Profile section. The recruiter wants to see that first ideally."
AskUK,3cgi8c,DrHydeous,6,Wed Jul 8 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I had enough of the increasing red tape (by increasing, I meant on an almost daily/weekly basis), increasing restrictions both on my personal life and the job itself, diminishing perks (public sector pay freezes), unequal rights (police officers the only role that cannot strike/take industrial action) and the increasing ""looking over your shoulder"". I also wanted promotion but even one step up is EXTREMELY competitive. There were something like 200 Sergeant vacancies across London and around 5000 applicants(!) so felt like I was stuck in my job. Always wanted something more academic, and decided that now was the time to pursue it.  The job itself - as in the ""on the streets"" side of it can be exciting as fuck. Yes, the police get a bad rap, and rightfully so sometimes but the experiences I've had and the satisfaction I had of catching bad guys and doing the right thing was great. It really is what you think it will be like - I was chasing after burglars and robbers, driving fast pursuing stolen cars (well, mostly mopeds ridden by chavs). I got to see things that most people won't get to see and go places most people won't get to go. I've dealt with all sorts of people I'd never normally get to meet. I've been involved in major events like the Olympics, Royal Wedding, Thatcher's funeral etc. I had some great perks like getting to watch the Champion's League Final for free (whilst working ofcourse).  The positives outweigh the negatives, but it's not for everyone. You will get assaulted. You will get abuse. Not just a slap in the face and told to fuck off, I've been threatened with knives, been spat in the face, punched, elbowed, bitten. I've seen some horrible things, had to pick pieces of people off the road, seen families devastated and dead bodies, suicides etc. Some things will never leave my mind. I remember someone throwing a large dog out of a 5th floor window, it fell and hit someone walking past on the pavement outside giving them a fractured skull and obviously killing the dog.  I've seen people impaled, human remains spread over half a mile after being dragged by a bus. But I've also seen the good side. Anyone living in London will be able to relate to it feeling very unfriendly, everyone is always in a rush etc compared to living outside of London. But when things go bad, and people do bad things, all sorts of people come together to help. Countless times I've been called to a robber/burglar detained by members of the public, a real mixture of people just coming out of their daily lives/work to do the right thing and help. I think that instinct just comes out in people when the time is right.  And your question, if I could turn back time and not join at all? No. Way. I wouldn't change anything. I have some amazing experiences that I'll never forget and cool stories to tell. It is amazing job satisfaction knowing you really made a difference (usually for the better) in people's lives on a daily basis.  Go for it, 100%. It's really competitive, more than when I joined. Good luck!"

AskUK,3cgi8c,spacetimebear,3,Wed Jul 8 12:59:35 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't worry about it, I think in some instances you can actually be overqualified.  I applied for a part time job when I was at uni once and was flat out told that I was just too qualified.  Which is kind of a backhanded compliment, I suppose!  My advice to going about this would be to try an agency.  They helped me get some great part time work before.  I used a company called Brooke Street (who got me my first ever job) and then another called Pertemps.  Definitely worth registering with them - they actively hunt jobs out for you which is good!  Best of luck man, and even if you can't find something now (which I'm sure you will anyway) you'll come out of the other side with a bitching degree and a great job."

Agencies are always a fairly good bet for quick and relatively easy money, sometimes you're much better paid than permanent staff, and some companies will pick you up from an agency if you're good; I was offered a fantastic job by a multinational insurance company in fraud prevention through an agency but I was off to university."

AskUK,3cgi8c,AdrianBlake,3,Tue Jul 7 22:48:16 2015 UTC,"So.    Get a format. Your CV is very boring and while that might be all-right in a technical job for most jobs it'd be overlooked. Basically make it look pretty or at least eye catching but don't flood it with shit. Cut the fat. So many paragraphs and sentences. Try and limit this. Maybe 3-5 bullet points about key responsibilities (tailor these to the job you're applying for if you wish. i.e. if a job you are applying for requires a lot of teamwork then emphasize your teamwork abilities through your previous jobs)  Key Skills. Got anything you're particularly good at? or skills you've picked up while in previous employment? put these here. A bit like your qualifications section but encompassing more abilities. Who are you? One of the key aspects employers look at when short-listing CV's is info about the person themselves. Put something about your interests and hobbies, what you do in your spare time etc. Try not to put anything fucking weird.   Honestly though even with changes to your CV I think finding a shitty student job will be difficult for you since your past work makes you seem far more competent than the average student employed to stack shelves and not ask questions. If money is not an issue, might be worth volunteering with roles linked to your future choice of degree."
AskUK,3cgi8c,Mitchfarino,3,Tue Jul 7 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, 34 jobs isn't a huge amount of applications, in today's world, even if it feels that way. I went through a period where I'd applied for about 20 and had no interviews. The following week I sent three applications and I had interviews for all three -- one of which is my current job. I hadn't done anything differently at all.   It's just sheer luck with these things, sometimes."
AskUK,3cgi8c,duluoz1,5,Tue Jul 7 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"I'll put this out there. 1) You might be overqualified 2) Having been a police officer might make the cautious. People don't necessarily employ the most capable person for a job, they want a cog who fits the machine. As with many low skill jobs, if you write that you're ambitious go getter with team leadership skills who likes to take the initiative, you may get rejected on that alone. I once got through a psychometric test for a supermarket job by answering the opposite of what I'd write for a regular job, much more humble and less about selling myself as Mr. Fantastic. There's also an element of people wanting someone they can mould, rather than someone who is already confident and might challenge their authority.   Also being a copper is really intimidating to some people. If I was a small business that was sloppy about things occasionally I would not want an ex-copper around. I've worked for plenty of coke heads and worked plenty of low skilled jobs where half my colleagues were stoners. People are just generally conditioned to be nervous around coppers, you might also be facing the same discrimination legally qualified people do, employers don't want people who will hold them to the rules and potentially cause a problem if they fail to uphold them.   Also being a police officer is the kind of job that require some degree of mental activity and initiative, it's also pretty exciting  (at least compared to stacking shelves), maybe they think you'll be under stimulated and move on. This is pretty much the overqualified thing.  Have you tried positions which are based on trust? Part time security work for example. These are the kind of jobs where your history would be a massive asset. You're also guaranteed to ace any checks so even working around children would be possible."

AskUK,3cgi8c,TermWerker,2,Tue Jul 7 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"Well Nervous Energy pretty much champed the frig out of that one.   I'd say that maybe you ARE too qualified for a lot of entry roles, which is a dumb thing to be an issue but there you go. You say you were a manager of 120 people? Well I'd guess they'll be thinking ""hmm, this guy used to run things, and was a cop so used to being in authority... if we stick him in a job where he literally just has to follow orders even if it's a dumb one from his manager Greg (fucking Greg...) then will he start pointing out that Greg is an arsehole? Will he try to take control? Will he start trying to apply the law to things? Maybe I'll hire this guy with two years as a cashier instead, because they are less likely to rock the boat. They might even just wonder why you want entry after being far from entry, and not take the chance. The above almost certainly isn't true for what you're like, but you can see why they'd find it easier to go for the safe option.  Conversely, if you're applying for a supervisory, or manage job, then ""ran a big team, know how to tell knobheads to stop being knobheads, used to taking shit from people and acting professional whilst upholding authority"" is a massive plus.  I think maybe you just want ANYTHING to start with, and so are going for the bottom. You want A job, so you can use that to pay you whilst you get a better job. Whilst that's obviously the best thing morally and financially, the employer will probably guess that and doesn't want to train someone just to refill the position when you move on in a few months. I say maybe get your aim up a bit. Go for supervisor as a minimum, manager as the average. You might think there are less going and you have less chance of getting it, but I think you'll have better luck. Keep a few low level applications going out as well if you want, but I think you'd be better suited higher with your experience."
AskUK,3cgi8c,ButterBalls1712,2,Tue Jul 7 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you made a decent effort in your reply too so thanks for that.  I'm only after a retail/restaurant/hospitality type job as it would be the most basic and relevant job for my degree. When I'm looking at graduate schemes or internships in a few years I want to be able to say either ""I took that job as I wanted to prove I could graft at the front end of the business"" or ""I wanted to work part-time in a front end sales type role to gain insight into that side of business"".  If I work as a cleaner or in a warehouse or some other labour job behind the scenes I'd kind of see it as a waste of spare time/opportunity when I could be doing something that looks better on a CV or application in future?  I always thought I'd be setting my sights too high if I applied for retail manager/supervisor jobs as I imagine they get dozens of applications, many of whom will have recent experience managing in stores etc and perhaps wouldn't take management experience in another sector as having the same weight.  Thinking about it now they, if I sell myself right in a covering letter/CV perhaps one level up would be the right way to go, aiming for supervisor level....the qualities I'm trying to put across are what recruiters are looking for at that level I guess. I imagine a lot of those getting these entry-level jobs are students/school leavers as companies will think ""they just want a job while they're studying and won't move on elsewhere"". That's what I want!"
AskUK,3cgi8c,theBreadSultan,2,Tue Jul 7 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"Here's my my reply from your previous post....  I think it may come across as you are over qualified.  When I have been looking through CVs and come across someone who is clearly more qualified than what the role entails, I always think that the candidate won't be around for long so often don't shortlist them.  Either in your introduction, or better still your covering letter, include your goals / aspirations. There's no mention of your degree either, so how are the employers going to know what your situation is."

I recruit a lot and see a lot of CVs so I have a good idea of what works.  At the top I have a brief paragraph describing me..e.g. I'm a experienced marketer with a passion for business to business.  Then the job history...  Bullet points! Do it! I have each job I had as a paragraph title including the dates I held the position.   I then have a sub heading of Key Responsibilities with bullet points...This gives you a chance to go over not only what you did but also what skills you used.  Next sub heading is Main Achievements...This is where you give examples of projects you worked on or something you want to show off e.g. Team performance management. Bullet points again!   Good luck! Job hunting sucks but hang in there.
AskUK,3cgi8c,Barry_Scotts_Cat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"I have been applying for jobs since November with no luck, until recently when I've had 2 job offers after changing my CV quite a bit. So what I did was assume that every employer only had 60 seconds or so to read your CV before they get bored and Chuck it out, because they had so many others to read. So I put all of my relevant experience on that first page, so if they are still interested in you from all your relevant information, qualifications and experience, then they can turn over and get more detailed information.   I still keep it all in a similar format to what you have, with the usual headings, but just order it differently.  Presentation is also important. Don't have a black font, print it in a medium-dark grey. It's easier on the eyes and looks better. Also adding a highlight colour such as a navy blue, dark red or green to underline the separate sections and underline your name at the top etc. Just make it look nice, and stand out from the others.  Also, I noticed that you, like so many other people just state a quality that you have. In an interview, an employer will probably ask ""So Mr Smith, can you give me an example of when you've been organised?"" Or something to that effect. The point I'm trying to make here is to justify every claim you make in your CV with evidence. Explain how you have that trait, where you learnt it etc.  Just keep being persistent and you'll find one, don't worry! Hard work always pays off!  Hope this all helps!"

AskUK,3cjipc,Obnoxious_laughter_,3,Wed Jul 8 12:02:29 2015 UTC,"I've been a student in both cities, though I studied at Edinburgh uni rather than herriot watt. A few things to consider here:  1) Edinburgh is, I would say, a slightly better city than Cardiff in many ways. More to see and do, much prettier. That's not to say Cardiff is bad at all- quite the contrary, it's a very friendly and easy city and I love living there. Better nightlife too if that matters to you.   Also worth noting that the HW campus is a ways out of the city centre, so you'd be taking a lot of buses if you want to experience Edinburgh properly. Cardiff uni is central and entirely walkable.   2) Cardiff is much cheaper, especially when it comes to rent. Seriously half the cost; Edinburgh is beaten only by London when it comes to the 'expensive city' stakes.   3) How important is reputation/prestige to you? I don't know anything about your specific course, but overall Cardiff is considered a better university than HW and the Russell Group status may matter to you even if it's irrelevant to your actual education. HW justifiably or not suffers from the unfortunate 'second fiddle' label next to the more famous Edinburgh Uni, similar to Oxford Brookes next to Oxford or indeed Cardiff Metropolitan next to Cardiff. How much of an impact the prestige gap would have on your future employment prospects I have no idea.   I would pick Cardiff based solely on what I know, but my information is incomplete as I've never studied at HW and I'm not an urban planner. In the end you'll probably have a great time regardless of which you pick, so relax a bit."

Cardiff almost feels like a campus university in that all of the university buildings are located next to each other, and most of the housing is pretty much next to the university, but then it's only 10 minutes away from the city centre rent is really cheap compared to most other city uni's, this year i'm paying Â£300 a month it has a lot of events (Millennium stadium, motorpoint arena, Millennium Centre)  and the nightlife is great, and the Student Union nightclub (Y plas) is easily the best student union I've been too  i think you're specific course is really small intake, thats the impression i got from a guy studying it, and you'd be in the Glamorgan building a lot which is nice as it is opposite Alexandria gardens Cardiff Bay is really good for a day/evening out   I love Cardiff and want to stay there after I graduate(originally from essex).

I wouldn't go straight into living on your own, what I did was, went onto spare room and lived in a shared house / flat which was all inclusive of bills and also rented by a private landlord.

AskUK,3ch8gn,donebythehands,4,Wed Jul 8 12:20:26 2015 UTC,Quick pro tip: Photograph and document on the inventory every teeny tiny flaw the property has. Give copies of the photos to the letting agent and get them to sign the inventory as well as you. This can save a lot of hassle and debates over deposit when you move out. Also get EVERYTHING in writing and make sure they use the deposit protection scheme. I believe it is now illegal not to.
AskUK,3ch8gn,rockchick99,3,Tue Jul 7 22:55:00 2015 UTC,"If you really want to avoid fees, you can move to Scotland. The rent is cheaper than in England in most places outside of central Edinburgh and Glasgow (and Aberdeen because of the oil boom), and letting fees/agent fees are illegal."

Don't be a Mug, check local papers, local ads (newsagents etc), Loot and gumtree etc.  Also...final tip...don't look happy with the place when you see it...talk to the landlord...the only time you are ever gonna get a reduction on the rent...is before you move in...even if you only get a tenner off a week...that Â£120 in your back pocket... so be sure to find lotys of things wrong with the place...

AskUK,3ch8gn,theBreadSultan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:32:40 2015 UTC,"Bad agents will charge you a month or a month and a half rent up front as the deposit, and several hundred for checking your references. I strongly recommend dealing directly with a landlord instead. It'll be cheaper. Look in the small ads of your local paper."
AskUK,3ch8gn,DrHydeous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"Try to go with a private landlord directly rather than through a letting agency. That way there shouldn't be any fees other than the deposit.  Expect a deposit to be the equivalent of around 1-2 months rent (typically two months if you have pets, one month without). You'll  also have to pay your first month's rent up front.  You might be wise to consider a house-share if this is your first time living away from your folks. It can be easier than jumping in and renting a place on your own.    NB. With regard to agency fees:   I have one property that a letting agent handles, they charge a flat Â£150 'application fee' to prospective tenants, which covers background/credit checks, escrow fees, plus their time, etc. Many agents charge more than this and can tack on additional fees without warning, beware of such practices.  My other properties I rent privately and don't charge any extraneous fees to tenants."
AskUK,3ch8gn,DEADB33F,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:00:13 2015 UTC,"If you want to avoid upfront fees then you'll pretty much need to avoid all real estate agencies in England. Look for properties on gumtree and even your local papers. Deal directly with the landlord.  Once you do find a suitable property, make sure you are crystal clear on the terms in the tenancy contract (e.g. minimum notice periods, minimum lease periods etc.). Make sure the landlord / agency signs the documents in front of you and you take a copy immediately.  When you move in, take a picture of every single room and minor defect, be it scratches on the wall, flaking paint etc. Make sure everything stated in the inventory is true and correct. My parents recently moved into an apartment and the inventory was a complete fabrication of lies about freshly painted walls and brand spanking new furniture. Document all the descrepancies in an email to the person in charge of the property and DO NOT SIGN THE INVENTORY until it matches the exact description of the property in its current state.  Finally, make sure your deposit goes into a third party protection scheme (Deposit Protection Scheme). They will act as arbitrators if there are disputes about whether or not you get the full sum of your deposit back."
AskUK,3ch8gn,MDKrouzer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:03:07 2015 UTC,"From my own experience, it completely depends on the estate agent.   It can be anything from Â£150 to Â£500 for 'referee checks' and 'admin fees' and 'credit checks' and 'whatever other bullshit we can make up to get more of your money'.   Usually they also demand the value of a month's rent upfront as a deposit (which you should get back if they deem you've vacated the house in a good condition, but look out for biting cleaning fees at the end of the tenancy). Sometimes the deposit can even be six weeks rent+, though that seems to be a London thing.  So really it's going to be anywhere between Â£500 to Â£1000, which is a not particularly helpful range, so it would be worth phoning around the estate agents and asking what their fee policy is."

The landlords know that one months rent and a months deposit is often a bit of an ask... if you think you are gonna struggle with the deposit, ask the landlord if you can pay it in installments... So you would pay first months rent as normal, with Â£100 deposit, then next month just pay rent + Â£50 until you have it up to 1 month"
AskUK,3ch8gn,theBreadSultan,2,Wed Jul 8 10:37:28 2015 UTC,"Wow you have been lucky, not once have I ever met a landlord or letting agent that would accept that. They want it all upfront or you don't move in."

At my uni, Year one was gentle (non honours year and the marks didn't count, as many first year marks don't) and then years 2 and 3 were equally hard - it was a humanities course so you just had 'honours level' which was year 2 and 3 and you could take the courses in either year.   However - third year is the hardest not because of the degree, but because you'll generally be juggling it with job interviews, for big grad schemes applications open just before Christmas and then interviews and assessment centers go on all the way through until summer. The endless applications and online tests that take ages. A telephone interview will clash with a lecture. You end up losing two days work because you need to get a train down to London overnight for an interview. Have to study up the companies you're applying for as well as studying for exams.

AskUK,3ch49l,notamisprint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:01:09 2015 UTC,"I did a STEM subject for what it's worth.  Yes it was harder in terms of work given, difficulty and standard. I noticed that they seem to mark more harshly, so the level of effort that got you a 1st in 1st/2nd year won't cut it anymore.   But for what it's worth it's absolutely nothing like the jump between GCSE and A level in terms of difficulty. The first two years are supposed to build you up to this point, and while it is more difficult you should be perfectly well equipped. Frankly I didn't think it was as hard as others have told me in the past though. Even the dissertation isn't hard in terms of work, it's more of a keeping the passion for the subject going over an entire year...  I actually found second year more of a struggle. Less freedom in terms of what I was studying, similar workload but a whole lot less passion for the subjects I was studying.  You'll be fine, don't worry about it too much. That's half of the problem with 3rd year, people build it up and end up in a panic (which to be fair is easily done.) and a lot of people are demoralised by the fact they seemingly put so much more effort in and get similar marks to the previous years. Being in a panic won't do you any good!  Good luck with it."

Bear in mind, if you do this then you must carry your railcard with you whenever you use your Oyster card; failure to present it counts as fare evasion.

AskUK,3cetdb,bell42,2,Tue Jul 7 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"The maximum an Oyster Card could cap at off-peak is actually Â£18.90  for a normal adult, but there are lower caps if you are a student or have a railcard. There are are also various lower caps depending on where you travel, as low as Â£6.40.  No single fare is as high as Â£18.90, the maximum you would ever be charged for a single journey is Â£8.80 (Zone 1 - Shenfield). IFAIK How Oyster works is that it internally charges the most expensive fare possible from the station you start your journey at (even if it makes your balance negative temporarily), then refunds the difference to the actual fare as soon as you tap out at the end.  As long as you have enough money on the card to make the cheapest possible journey (Â£2.30 for most zone 1 stations for example, off peak) you will be allowed to enter the station. You just will not be allowed out if you traveled all the way to zone 6."
AskUK,3cetdb,colondee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:47:37 2015 UTC,"You're still allowed out, with negative balance, but then you must top up before you can get on anything else, even if it would usually be free (from being covered by a travelcard, or if you are now capped, for example)."

I dialled 999 and they despatched an ambulance to the address. 15-20 minutes later I received a call from the ambulance saying that they can't find the address/they knocked at the door and a little old lady answered who had no idea what they were talking about.   I didn't really have any mutual friends with her as she was a gig buddy and this was before the time of social networks so I couldn't track anyone else down. Feeling totally helpless I went to bed traumatised. My friend wasn't responding to texts/answering her phone and I couldn't do anything being 200 miles away.

AskUK,3ch496,Dodocogon,2,Tue Jul 7 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"I work at Brighton ticket office. So to make it clear, you have a ticket from Brighton to Cardiff and you have the 'via Salisbury' route which means changing at Fratton and then taking a FGW train to Cardiff?  Firstly, does the ticket say 'First Great Western only'? I doubt it does if you've selected this route, they never are. If it does not explicitly say 'First Great Western only' then you can take a Southern train to Fratton and then a FGW train to Cardiff.   The only problem I can see arising is is you booked yourself exclusively on the FGW 0859 service from Brighton and picked a station there to change at. You might have a FGW only ticket then and you'd run into problems. If so you are eligible for a 100% refund but you would need to buy another ticket to travel to Cardiff."
AskUK,3ch496,HolySheesh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:57:07 2015 UTC,"The ticket definitely uses southern service from Brighton from Fratton, my concern is coming in where due the the strike FGW train won't be running all the way to Fratton, but instead will only be running to Salisbury... It is an advance ticket, but I'm thinking I would be able to get my Southern ticket all the way to Salisbury, or at least to Southampton and buy a cheaper one for the connection to Salisbury to them catch a booked FGW train."
AskUK,3ch496,HolySheesh,2,Wed Jul 8 07:15:44 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""the strike FGW train won't be running all the way to Fratton""? Do you mean that the FGW services that is supposed to be leaving from Fratton will only be starting at Salisbury instead?  If this is the case then you are allowed to travel from Fratton to Salisbury on your tickets, so long as you stay within the recognised route. If you could post a picture of your tickets that would be great because then I could either confirm your suspicions or tell you what you'll need to do."
AskUK,3ch496,HolySheesh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:26:49 2015 UTC,"Sure thing - here's the online version of my ticket, haven't picked it up yet. http://imgur.com/qL5ldaY  And if you look at the FGW strike map, that is how I'm reading it.

AskUK,3ch496,hexapodium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:07:22 2015 UTC,"OK thanks, so you have 2 options here.  DON'T PRINT THE TICKET until you decide what you do.  Firstly call First Great Western's customer services. They will be able to tell you if you can travel between Fratton and Salisbury or not, I'm not at work atm so I don't want to say for sure you can because otherwise you might be fucked. If you can't travel between Fratton and Salisbury, stick to your current tickets as it will be financially worth it to just buy a single from Fratton to Salisbury to catch your later connection. You are allowed to take an earlier train to get to Fratton on time to get to Salisbury.   Or, you can get a full refund on the tickets you have purchased and then just buy a straight single from Brighton to Cardiff. Only do this if you want the convenience of travelling whenever you choose. If you go for this route DO NOT PRINT THE TICKETS. You are eligible for a 100% refund."
AskUK,3cellz,Apfel,4,Tue Jul 7 08:39:30 2015 UTC,Why can't she teach? You don't need a teaching qualification to teach at private schools. Someone I know went into teaching straight after his BA at a private school in North London and I've been sent a few emails through my uni asking to apply to schools and none of us have teaching qualifications.
AskUK,3cellz,harberton,6,Tue Jul 7 10:41:00 2015 UTC,I'm sure private schools would love to have a chinese speaking teacher.

AskUK,3cellz,redbowkiki,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:22:33 2015 UTC,Interesting idea. I think I'll look into this further. Maybe self-advertising via gumtree or something like that at first then building up referrals.
AskUK,3cellz,sometimesihelp,3,Tue Jul 7 11:34:50 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/How2999; places like Down House or Winchester College will want Chinese mandarin teachers and I think she could get a job teaching in some public schools.
AskUK,3cellz,lazytoxer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:45:30 2015 UTC,Whilst Gumtree and contacting colleges is a great start it might also eventually be worth starting her own domain for website & emails to make it look more professional. After all the types of clients willing to pay for Mandarin lessons privately are not typically the type to frequent Gumtree.   Also with more experience consider doing it over video (e.g. Skype) to expand her client base.

I met her about 12 years ago now, but if IIRC mostly it was fairly dull technical stuff that she translated.  I don't know about any certification she required, I imagine she had to pass some in-house literacy tests, before she could start.  Have a google, be a bit careful, I'm sure there's some dodgy companies trying to prey on immigrants."
AskUK,3cellz,Iainfletcher,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:37:18 2015 UTC,This is a good idea. I'll definitely do some googling on this when I get home. I'm also a bit worried about dodgy companies.

AskUK,3cellz,Frank_IV,2,Tue Jul 7 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"It only takes a year to do your PGCE, if she really wants to teach, it's not a ridiculous amount of time to spend on getting the right piece of paper.  In the mean time, she could reach out to adult education.  I work in the field with teachers who have no teaching qualification at all, it's mostly about knowing your subject and being able to convey that.  She'll need to have a criminal background check, it may be worth her applying to have that done herself - look into it.  Any institution she works for may want to run one themselves, but especially with her being a foreign national, the process will go a LOT quicker if she's already had the check done."
AskUK,3cellz,lonelyinacrowd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:26:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for this comment. Yeah, I think the problem isn't the time rather than the money (non-EU nationals have to pay crazy fees for this).  She's already done her Chinese criminal record check and got it notarised, thankfully. I'll get on to her to get the British one done, as I wasn't aware it was so helpful to do it in advance.   When you say adult education, what field do you work in exactly? A university or something?  EDIT: Just saw a pretty cheap chinese-teaching PGCE : only Â£3000 from SOAS in London. This seems like a really viable option."
AskUK,3cellz,lonelyinacrowd,3,Tue Jul 7 12:32:29 2015 UTC,"The term 'adult education' tends to refer to adults going back to the classroom.  Rather than further or higher education which is the progression from school to university sometimes through a college.  Maybe the terms have become less rigid, so apologies for lack of clarification.  Basically I work the community courses that have no certification at the end of it.  Specifically in my case music for those with mental health, the idea being using music to get them back into socialising and using it for positive health etc.  But it extends to just college classes.  My uncle taught for a while at a local college, he had a degree but certainly no qualification in education.  Inquire at local colleges that cover these options.  I'm sure she could teach mandarin on a more casual level at one of these during the year she's looking at a PGCE.  The money isn't great but the experience will look great on her CV."
AskUK,3cgbuc,mookx,3,Tue Jul 7 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"She's mistaken. Bank holidays do count towards your holiday, but they don't count if you wouldn't normally be working on those days. You're entitled to 16.8 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays off. If Christmas Day or Boxing Day fall on a day you'd normally work then they'd count as holiday. A bank holiday Monday doesn't count as a holiday day for you any more than a Sunday counts as a holiday day for a full time employee."
AskUK,3cgbuc,stevemegson,3,Tue Jul 7 18:24:34 2015 UTC,That's what my prior HR lady had told me. I hope you are right. Do you have a link I could forward her? My google-fu is letting me down.
AskUK,3cgbuc,stevemegson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm stuggling to find anywhere that explicitly says it, since it seems to be generally considered to be obvious that it's not a day's leave if you wouldn't be working anyway. It's not so much a law as the definition of the word.  Perhaps the best way of convincing her would be to clarify that you're entitled to 16.8 days of paid leave, and ask for confirmation in writing that you will receive four days' pay in weeks containing a bank holiday. That might be enough to make her realise that she's talking nonsense.  (If she does in fact agree that that is the policy, it would probably be seen as offering pay in lieu of holiday and therefore illegal, but let's assume that that's not what she's thinking.)"

AskUK,3cezun,lottesometimes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"That's because of an edge case where you've reserved the last seat in the advance tier, so other sites will move to the next one. If you wait for it to time out the other sites will then show the lower fare."
AskUK,3cezun,cool110110,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:25:27 2015 UTC,I was talking more around promotions. They had a May promotion for example which meant that with the fee it was still Â£5 cheaper to book through them than going with the rail company or even other booking sites that don't charge a fee
AskUK,3cezun,lottesometimes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:06:43 2015 UTC,Their interface is good and my card details are saved. I know that's ridiculous but it's the truth. They also have a machine in my workplace where I can collect tickets.

AskUK,3cezun,grodecki,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:36 2015 UTC,It makes sense when you remember that it was partly owned by Virgin until 2006.
AskUK,3cezun,cool110110,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:17:02 2015 UTC,because sometimes they have offers making the tickets cheaper even if they add a booking fee.
AskUK,3cezun,lottesometimes,7,Wed Jul 8 09:14:25 2015 UTC,All the sites use same ticket allocation pool meaning you get same price whether you're on site A or B.

It goes against Section 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, the guidelines on which are laid out here by the Serious Fraud Office. As stated in that document, it contravenes the common law provisions for being fit to stand trial in R v Pritchard.   The defendant must be able to: understand the charges, enter a plea, challenge jurors, instruct his legal advisers, follow the course of proceedings, give evidence in his own defence.   Computers are a long, long way from being able to do things like that. We can't try a robot for crushing a man more than we can try a shark for killing someone - they lack the awareness to be tried. I don't think we'll ever realistically come to a point (in the next 100 years or so) where robots will meet the above guidelines, notwithstanding some kind of extraordinary common-law decision which lays out guidelines for trying robots.   If we were able to try the robot, it was only doing what it was programmed to do (grab things within a certain area), it was in no way acting out of sentience or malice.

That way I see the cheapest places to go, and also can look at the cheapest days to depart and return.  Then you can look up booking.com and find the right level of hotel for you. Airport transfers are fairly easy to find with Google. Smart use of Google maps street view will allow you to see the area your hotel is in as well.  I appreciate this approach isn't for everyone. It requires a lot more work and also means you have to pay the whole holiday in one go usually, instead of deposit and payments as with a travel agency. You usually pay a little extra for that convenience though. I've been to Majorca and Amsterdam this way, and going to Dublin for New Year much cheaper than with travel agent's quoted this year as well."

Whenever I have done trades with people from America once it is in the UK using the same tracking number on the parcelforce website provides an update. If it's still in customs it will say that's where it is.  Just to warn you it can take a few days to clear customs and it is normal for it to fall off the grid during that time and only say it's in customs - but should eventually show back up on the parcel force website with more updated info when they get handed it.  Also All my trades have been over Â£15 and never have I needed to pay any VAT or anything on it - it has come through as a gift if it was sent as such.
AskUK,3cbnbk,physicsandcode,5,Mon Jul 6 19:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's luck more than anything on whether you have to pay VAT. Sometimes they catch it, sometimes they don't. In my experience the VAT is usually much smaller than the handling charge slapped on by Royal Mail, etc."

They pretty much inspect and fee every single parcel they handle. For 'Royal Mail' handled deliveries (AirMail, SAL, Ground Mail) it's a bit more hit and miss - and seems to depend to an extent on where the item is coming from. Their handling fee depends on value of item.   (NB ParcelForce is just a brand of Royal Mail Group but operates distinct from domestic RM)  If the item is high value, and in a category where the duty is not waived if under a threshold, you may well have to pay import duty AND the VAT on the total cost including duty.

You could entertain yourself every night of the week and all weekend in London, every day, with good free /donation-only events. Sign up to the 'ianvisits' email for some ideas, look at free gigs like 'Daylight Music'. Get a flat with a lounge and flatmates in the same age range, hang out with drinks there rather than in pubs.

It's possible to live in London on far less than 30k a year, although you're not going to out on the piss up the West End every weekend and wearing all the latest clobber.   I understand it is a very expensive city but there are so many universities and surely not all students can come from well-off families?   Many get jobs and work to pay the way.   I will only get 230 pounds per week which from what I've seen, will not even be able to cover accommodation?!   If you rent privately then probably not, no.

If you can't go where you really want to, I suggest taking an extra year to go there.

I was on the pre-2012 starters and I switched to a 4 year course (where they double it for the last year) just because of the massive profit. Though 230 pounds a week is about what I spent last year (including rent), and I consider myself pretty bad at saving money. I did largely stick to student pubs and Weatherspoons. Generally unis will have cheap...ish first year accommodation with bills included (go self catered - catered student accommodation is a nightmare for a number of reasons). In second year you should share a flat, which could get rent down to 130-160ish renting privately. Alternatively, if you want a fancy luxury student accommodation and don't mind sharing a room, some have really nice twin rooms for around the same price. At 100 a week after rent you just have to remember money isn't infinite. At, say, 80 a week you need to keep half an eye on it. At 60 a week you'll have to seriously budget."

Â£230 a week will definitely cover your accommodation in first year, it's all inclusive so you don't need to worry about bills or anything.  and as a clearing student its highly unlikely you'll get put in France house (the most expensive) as they're highly sought after.   The great thing about QM if that its all campus based, so you can live right next to the uni and it cuts down on travel, also theres shops, cafes, bars etc. on campus and Mile End Road or Bethnal Green Road a bit further up, so you have everything you need at hand.   Lots of my friends didn't have any parental assistance at uni and managed to get by, QM has lots of student jobs on campus which is great because they're super flexible with schedules as obviously they understand that your work load fluctuates, also there are lots of waiter-ing companies that love students (you pick which shifts you want to work) and the minimum wage in london is higher than elsewhere.   London can be expensive but there are a lot of free activities you can do too, not everyone is running around drinking Moet at some posh bar on the Kings Road. QM has a good mix of people too from the not well off to rather well off, whereas some other unis in London have a larger proportion of wealthy students."

If you say you don't the insurer may decline to quote, or charge you more.  If you say you do have such locks and then make a claim and it emerges that you don't then you claim may be denied or reduced.

AskUK,3c7wwd,xzygx,15,Sun Jul 5 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Nottingham local here.  Notts is full of great pubs and bars, a quick google will throw up a lot of good suggestions, or just take a wander around. I'm partial to the Organ Grinder, Lincolnshire Poacher (vast selection of whisky), Canal House (nice beer selection, old boathouse, still has longboat inside bar). Also near little mini-pubs like Doctors Orders and erm... that place up Hurt's Yard that I can't remember the name of.  Some great restaurants for eating too if you can afford to treat yourself. Google's your friend there as it's down to taste. If Canada is much like my experience in America though, then you won't have much in the way of proper Indian cuisine available. Get some down ya.  Lots of sports going on, two great historic football teams (though there's none happening as it's summer), an ice hockey team, Trent Bridge for cricket, national watersports centre.  Nottingham Castle is more of a manor than a castle after the original castle got torn to bits in the civil war, but worth a poke around for a tourist. Wollaton Hall has lovely grounds surrounding it and again is a good place to visit for someone who's not from here. Those of us who've spent nearly 30 years here are pretty bloody fed up of spending summer Saturday afternoons staring at that taxidermied bear though. It's also Wayne Manor in the Batman films. Beware of the deer.  Sherwood Forest is better described as Sherwood Patch of Trees nowadays but there are outdoor activities held there.  Galleries of Justice.  Nottingham Contemporary for art.  Have a wander around the Lace Market and Hockley for a small but growing creative quarter.  If you have or can get use of a car, Peak District is a short drive away and is very good if you're into hiking and very Englishy countryside.  And generally being in the Midlands places you slap bang in the middle of the country. You're no more than two or three hours drive / train journey from most of England (excluding rush hour / bank holiday traffic). If you want to get somewhere you can do it without having to set aside a four day weekend to do it. Though if you want to see London properly, you'll need more than a weekend to see what's there. It's much bigger than any city in Canada (going off the top of my head).  Enjoy your stay, hope Notts treats ya well.  Edit - obligatory /r/nottingham plug. It's a bit quiet but something interesting might pop up."

AskUK,3c7wwd,Ackenacre,3,Sun Jul 5 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Hi. I used to live in Nottingham but originally grew up in Birmingham and now living in Yorkshire.   Birmingham is a bigger city than Nottingham and you can find loads of great things to do. It's about an hour and 20 mins away on the train from Nottingham. I between the two you have the Derbyshire Peak District which is beautiful. Matlock is pretty easy to get to and offers beautiful views. Tamworth near Birmingham has a castle. Further north of Nottingham you have Sherwood Forest which is lovely. West Yorkshire countryside is stunning. I recommend Harrogate, likely, Saltaire. They're my favourite places in Yorkshire outside of cities like Leeds and York.    All of these places shouldn't take you long to get to. York is the furthest and will take about 3 hours.   As far as Nottingham goes itself I love the city and regularly go back to see friends. Given your age I would say the kind of places you want would be the orange tree, spanky van dykes, pit and pendulum, tilt (if you fancy cocktails), das kino is a pretty nice bar too.   Hope that's a help."

If you want to ""See the  sights"" then an open topped bus tour would be good- you get to see most of the most important ones without having to get on and off the tube. That way you would have more time to do what you really love and could still say you had seen them.  You are just over an hour by train from Lincoln- see the Magna Carta there.

Be sure.to check the details of the accomodation as the first few pages based on lowest price tend to be hostels with dormatories or miles out from the city centre. If you want a private room near the centre of London prices start from about Â£30-Â£35 per night upwards. Also check out the reviews for your chosen hotel on tripadvisor to check whether it's up to the standards you expect.

If you get down to London then travelling won't be a problem - trains from Nottingham to London are about 2 hours and don't appear to be too pricey (about Â£30-40 one way) or then again there is always a bus (national express or megabus).  If you can drive then the Peak District is a must as you're so close. There are some lovely towns in the Peaks; although it's been a while, Buxton was lovely when I was last there.  If you want to see some great history then there is Warwick Castle which is about 90 minutes from Nottingham, however it is so over-commercialised it's not as enjoyable as it used to be."

AskUK,3c8osb,ieya404,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:09:52 2015 UTC,Well I doubt that matters. If I own a shop that only accepts credit card payment. The fact you don't have a credit card doesn't mean you can walk out without paying.
AskUK,3c8osb,How2999,4,Mon Jul 6 09:23:20 2015 UTC,"In which case you have a manned shop and can discuss payment options (or lack of them) with the potential customer.  In this case we have a car park, an ordinary ticket machine that takes money, and it's covered over so it's out of use.  In the absence of a staff member to explain otherwise, or clear signs indicating otherwise, it's entirely reasonable to assume that a car park will take money, and if its facility for taking money is disabled then as long as the car park's open it's free to use."
AskUK,3c8osb,ieya404,-3,Mon Jul 6 09:27:47 2015 UTC,"That isn't reasonable!   Ok, imagine a new Tesco store with only one self service machines. The self service machine coin slot is non-operational. Does that mean you can just take your shopping free? I mean, without the sign telling you to pay by card it's reasonable to assume Tesco want you to have the items for free."
AskUK,3c8osb,How2999,5,Mon Jul 6 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"If Tesco had an unmanned store that was open, and they made normal methods of payment impossible to use, they'd certainly be asking for it... (though even then there's a difference between depriving them of physical goods, and parking on some tarmac which doesn't exactly incur any cost for the owners).  That said, it seems we may both be in error!  Looking at for example Southwark's website,   If we know a meter is out of order, a bag will be placed over it to show that it's not working, this suspends the parking place and parking is not allowed.   Please do not park on pay and display bays where the machines are out of order. If you do park there, you may be issued with a penalty charge notice.    and   Suspended meters or machines  Sometimes we have to suspend parking meters and pay and display machines for various reasons. Suspended meters are covered with a bright yellow bag that states that the meter is not in use. Suspended machines will have a notice attached to them. Any vehicle found in a suspended bay will receive a parking fine and may be removed.    Though it would seem needlessly bastardy to take the car park out of operation without also locking it up to stop people parking in it!  Ultimately the answer may be to check for any sign/writing on the cover, or contact the owners of the car park to find out what the current scoop actually is."
AskUK,3c8osb,ieya404,2,Mon Jul 6 09:40:21 2015 UTC,"I think, especially after reading the other answers, there is no one correct answer. Your best bet is to ring up the local authority (or whoever) who actually runs the car park.  As the answer about Southwark says, there should be a procedure. Either parking is free, or it is completely suspended. Somewhere, whether this is on the meter, on the cover, on a notice elsewhere in  the car park, or only on the regulations of the council website.  Many times I have been in a situation where the machine is not working but the warden is around. In those cases the warden has it's OK and he won't give me a ticket."
AskUK,3c8osb,tmstms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:50:29 2015 UTC,"This page from the Citizen's Advice Bureau implies that the law remains as it always was. You have no right to park by a broken machine. (Which makes a lot of sense from a practical point of view, as it removes an incentive to deliberately break the meter.)  However, they do suggest that the council might accept an appeal if there was no nearby alternative."
AskUK,3c8osb,NotAgainAga,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"There may not be a definitive answer to this really. If they are being reasonable they should just allow free parking (within whatever time limits they have set), I tend to put a notice up in the car saying ""meter broken"". This has got more complicated now you can pay by phone however. The problem is they can just be pricks and slap a fine on your car, you then have to go through the hassle of appealing, potentially losing, and having to pay more."
AskUK,3c8osb,hoffi_coffi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:35:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I like the idea of the note in the window, will do that and hope they're not feeling like pricks.

If it was sung it would only be a temporary, very short-lived addition to the song, which would only be relevant during the 3-month period following the Battle of Prestonpans in late September 1745 and the replacement of Marshal Wade as head of the British forces by the Duke of Cumberland by the beginning of 1746.   Or see http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/jacobitesenlightenmentclearances/rebelliousscots/index.asp   For a short period in late 1745 some opinion suggests an additional verse was sung.

AskUK,3c82vw,a_tiny_baby,9,Sun Jul 5 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"From many hours wasted spent watching Police Interceptors, I can tell you the rozzers have an eye for non-standard plates (if their ANPR cameras won't read them then they know they're non standard and worth a 'pull'). If you're confident that a cheaper site will make them to a good enough standard so as to be indistinguishable (i.e. with the same legally required font, spacing, material and reflectiveness) from the 'official' DVLA ones, then go for it. I'd avoid getting any custom text underneath the registration number as that's a surefire giveaway that they're non-standard. Don't be tempted to get a ""Euro plate"" as you sometimes see on UK cars as that's screaming to get pulled over constantly."
AskUK,3c82vw,lgf92,2,Sun Jul 5 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, good advice. Even if the plate is trying to stay within the spirit of the law, it's understandable for the police to find it a reason to be rather suspicious.  That said, the site the OP links to does appear to offer legitimate and compliant plates, and an imported US car is always going to attract attention, of both welcome and unwelcome varieties! If in doubt, maybe call the DVLA and ask them to confirm that this site is indeed a supplier that can be used?"
AskUK,3c82vw,vln,4,Sun Jul 5 20:45:09 2015 UTC,You must get your license plates from a registered supplier.  This doesn't have to be a 'shop' it can be mail-order or internet as long as the business is registered with the DVLA for the supply of license plates.    That website claims to be DVLA registered and it asks for all the appropriate documentation so it seems legit.

AskUK,3c82vw,DijonWolfie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:35:36 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily mean they have official quotas; I thought they had to have reason to suspyect you of something e.g. you are driving erratically, there appears to be something wrong with your car, they think the car is stolen, they are running a check point on some aspect of vehicle safety or legality.  Every time I have been stopped, the police gave me a reason I thought was perfectly fair even if it might be small e.g. my number plate was a bit dirty."

AskUK,3c8e3a,harberton,-8,Sun Jul 5 21:38:32 2015 UTC,"I don't drive, also I live right out in the countryside there isn't a bottle bank for at least 10 miles or so. I'm going to be really busy tomorrow too soooo.... To be honest, i'm not really looking for looking for alternative options just whether I can get away with it or not and what the consequences would be if caught. I know its a really immoral thing to do and I would normally recycle religiously but at the same time I don't want my Mum to find out I have been on the piss. From what i've read online it seems like the recycling system in the UK is woefully inefficient anyway, with as much as 25% of it ending up in the landfill anyway. Not that its any justification, i'm just really desperate.  EDIT: Since i'm being down-voted for this I feel I should specify that I am not some sort of environmental terrorist or a Jeremy Clarkson worshipper, i'm talking like 12 bottles of beer here. In my day to day life I recycle and consider myself a very green person. My issue is that time is short, these are dire straights for me and we can't all have chilled hippy parents. In terms of importance I put 'having a relationship with my only living parent' over 'not disposing of some lager bottles correctly'. I apologise. I know i'm a fucking scumbag."

Because that's the only reason to freak out this much. You're not underage (presumably, as your wording implies you've moved back in for a year, & you're moving away for a job), you're not stuck living with her & having to deal with judgement & lectures, & you're a bit old for grounding anyway.  So, chill. Let her find them. What is she gonna do? Phone you to complain you do something that pretty much everyone else does? And if she does hit the roof over 12 empty bottles? Well. She obviously has ridiculous standards & you will fall afoul of them eventually. Sooner or later, you're going to do something she disapproves of. That is life. Do it now & get it over with & hopefully she'll take future infractions in a calmer manner.  If you still want to get rid of them, just for the sake of being a good house guest & leaving the place tidy, then jeez stick em in a carrier bag & walk or get the bus to somewhere with a bottle bank."

Once it has been emptied they are unlikely to stop the van and inspect its content.   I think it is the other way round they care more about - non-recyclables in recycling bins. Your council may be different though."
AskUK,3c8e3a,tmstms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:42:43 2015 UTC,"As our council explains it, you are 100% correct. In order to get the recyclables taken by whoever takes them, it needs to be a certain % of purity, so that means e.g. not too much food waste on the pizza boxes or plastic bottles. If there purity is too low then the whole consignment gets rejected.  Although landfill is expensive, it's less of a problem to have a few recyclables in it. Our council claims some of it is burnt for electricity generation anyway."

Deaths in Ireland were certainly far higher than in mainland UK, but that's largely because the Irish put up quite a good fight and uprisings were pretty deadly at that time. Cromwell was horribly brutal everywhere he went pretty much, he quite happily enslaved captured enemy soldiers and executed people who got in his way."
AskUK,3c3joa,specofdust,4,Sat Jul 4 15:05:59 2015 UTC,"The civil war in England was pretty, well, civil. Compare it to the 30 years war and you see none of the atrocities or violent sacking of cities. In the Second Civil War, he was also very lenient with the Scots, seeing them as good god-fearing people who were mislead by Charles.  With Ireland he was pretty Brutal. Owen Roe O'Neil's uprising and the inflated figures of the massacre of Protestants that circulated in 1640-1 was one of the reasons Parliament got all in a huff about Charles being unwilling to raise and army so tried to get powers to raise one themselves IIRC.  He hated papists and the puritan faction that came to dominate the New Model Army by the time of Cromwell's Irish campaigns were the type that actually believed that Laud's prayer book was crypto-catholic and that the catholic agents had a great influence over the king.  I don't know much about it, but I don't think it can be pigeon-holed as ethnic hatred towards the Irish that came after it (even though they were certainly looked down on as backward), as it often tends to be framed these days. I reckon what went down in Ireland was due to the fact it was more overtly Catholic. He went after the Anglo-Irish, new settlers and the Irish beyond the pale equally.  The Royalist garrison at Drogheda was English, they were massacred because they were thought to have been corrupted by merely being stationed in Ireland."

FTFY O_O   The Royalist garrison at Drogheda was English, they were massacred because they were thought to have been corrupted by merely being stationed in Ireland.   Indeed they were, and from my understanding most of the massacres he actually carried out were against either British or Anglo-Irish garrisons and such like anyway.  I'm not defending him as such, but just pointing out that there's a lot of ""he was so mean to us because we're Irish"" which really just isn't accurate."

AskUK,3c3joa,specofdust,2,Sat Jul 4 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely brutal, I remember my tutor translating some accounts of the Siege of Magdeburg which were really chilling.  But both were conducted between divided societies at a local level, rather than the 'normal' wars between hired armies. I may be making this up, but I'm sure something like 60% of men took up arms in the civil war, it's closer in levels of militarism than some other wars of the period.  Both shared soldiers and mercenaries that served in the environment on the continent like Alexander Leslie, Prince Rupert.  I'm not saying they're the same, because english society was totally different by this point. By the standards of the time, such a large civil conflict escalating to brutality wasn't unthinkable."
AskUK,3c3joa,VexillaRegisProdeunt,2,Sat Jul 4 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"Also, if I recall correctly the first stronghold he besieged, the garrison refused to surrender even after there was a breach in the walls. Typically for the time period as soon as there was a breach (and your forces are horrifically outnumbered) it was customary to surrender and negotiate terms. Except the garrison refused to surrender to Cromwell so he ordered his men to give no-quarter.  Which his men basically took as an excuse to sack the city. Every man at arms, every catholic priest they could find and a fair number of women and children were killed, all in all around 4,000 people. I'm not saying he explicitly ordered his men to kill so many people, but it's not like he didn't have a provocation. And as brutal as it was, by the time the news of the massacres spread, all the other strongholds surrendered peacefully.  Sucks for the Irish, but much like Gengis Khan there was a method to his brutality. Treat the first few like crap, and the others will fall in line."

Of course that all fell apart once Parliament actually met and started trying to vote itself all the power, essentially neutering the Council and Lord Protector, and thus he was forced to dissolve them with a technicality.

I'm sure at the re-enactments you'll get conservative voters supporting the Royalists in a light-hearted way like a football team.

And they gave him plenty of opportunities to do just that! But as usual he seemed to think that if he was stubborn enough for long enough everyone would just fall into line. Even when it got really bad, most people spoke about merely deposing him or forcing him to abdicate in favour of another king! He practically forced them to execute him!

AskUK,3c3joa,Esco91,3,Sat Jul 4 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"""Genocide"" is such a harsh term. It makes it sound like he was trying to categorically exterminate the Irish. Which just isn't true.  He was still a dick, but let's not get carried away. Reality is often more nuanced than we'd like it to be. The siege of Drogheda and subsequent massacre only happened after the garrison refused to surrender even after a breach in the walls. (which was common procedure at the time) Cromwell ordered no man at arms was to be given quarter, and to kill any catholic priests within. Some civilians died in the ensuing massacre, but they weren't explictly targeted by Cromwell. Furthmore, of the 3,000 strong garrison, a significant portion of them were English royalists. So it's not like Cromwell was specifically targeting the Irish.  Not that that excuses his religious intolerance and attempts at banning Christmas! But you get what I'm saying, right?"
AskUK,3c3joa,carmen_verandah,6,Mon Jul 6 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"The thing about Cromwell these days is that he was extremely religious. Most republicans are atheists, although there is strong support for republicanism amongst the small pockets of Catholics in places like Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow as well.   Cromwell was a Puritan, a hardcore protestant. And these days the monarchy is seen as hand in hand with the protestant church.  So really his movements pretty irrelevant in the modern age. As an example, take Old Firm football matches. The crowd in green (Celtic fans) will sing republican and catholic songs while waving Irish flags, while those in blue (Rangers) will sing protestant songs which praise the monarchy. So neither side will use him as a hero or a villain.  For most Brits he's just some part of history that theres a statue of in a prominent place."

AskUK,3c3joa,TinaTurnerSoldierSpy,5,Sat Jul 4 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"On mainland Britain, the last section of society to really admire Cromwell were radical 19th century Liberals - the mercantile bourgeois middle classes based in the manufacturing and industrial towns of the Midlands and North. They admired him as a pro-bourgeois radical who tipped the balance of power from the upper to the middle classes, and ushered in the start of our constitutional monarchy, an essential step towards the industrial revolution and capitalism.  Nowadays, there is no radical tradition in that section of society because they represent the establishment. Cromwell was not a hero to the workers' movement that emerged as a political force at the start of the 20th century because he smashed the Levellers (a populist movement) and opposed universal suffrage. His scrubs in Ireland have also tainted his legacy, and his undemocratic tendencies mean that he is not a good emblem for the republican movement."

But it seems so basic to be missing from primary/secondary.  That said your word 'primary' reminded me that that exists, and I might have slightly lied, because I do have the vaguest memory of hearing about Roundheads and things when I was about 7 (for whatever bloody good that was supposed to do).  Point taken that there's a lot to cover and something has to be missed out, but our whole consitutional setup derives a lot from the civil war era.  I think it might be a teeny bit more relevant and important than the time spent remembering Henry's wives and their respective means of death or divorce, or the endless self-congratulatory anecdotes about the amazing adventures of our marvellous brave explorer chaps like Drake, Cook and Livingstone (with absolutely zero regard to the darker side of our 'exploration').

On the other hand, a number of unionists and loyalists would 'admire' him to some extent, which is ironic considering they also love the royal family and the Queen.

We can say that the evolution of British politics after the English Civil war was influenced by both sides (parliament was strong and has continued to be, but monarchy came back in some form), so Cromwell does not have the same iconic significance as say Elizabeth I or Winston Churchill, or (to mention foreign examples, Lincoln, Washington, Napoleon)."

Our VAT is twice as high and I believe our import duty is higher, but that doesn't cut it in most cases.   There was an argument that it was due to the boom in popularity of cycling in the UK, but the price differences haven't gone away.  I know this doesn't answer your question as to why there is such a difference, and I fear only someone working directly for the company would be able to give you a direct answer.

AskUK,3c4q9w,sometimesihelp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"Part of it is pure premium but it is also supply/demand. Fewer people want expensive bikes so each individual bike has to make a bigger margin for the company, or even bike model, to make a profit.   Ultimately if they were making killer profits then other companies would invest in the market, competition would increase and prices would equalise. In reality this has already happened (after all when was the last time you heard of a bicycle company making mega-bucks?).   Don't forget that with Â£3k+ bicycles you're not looking at comparing it the Kawasaki Ninja 250SL - your comparing it to something like the Suzuki Hayabusa (Â£10k+).  Interestingly the Tour De France bikes have to be commercially available and would often cost Â£5k+. Time trial bikes could be Â£10k+.

AskUK,3c3u0h,SalamanderSylph,3,Sun Jul 5 13:29:08 2015 UTC,I've known people who have a lot of trainers (sneakers).  I wouldn't say it's a common though and is fairly chavvy.
AskUK,3c3u0h,tom808,3,Sat Jul 4 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"It's a big deal, possibly not as big as in America, and we definitely collect different stuff and have our own culture around it.  We are more into Air Max than J's. But there are regularly camp outs for big releases."

AskUK,3c3u0h,ppphhh,7,Sat Jul 4 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"Amongst the under 30's definitely. Maybe quite urban centric but having the right trainers has always been a big deal, lots of youngsters have started collecting a lot more in recent times.

In fact there is a trainer convention at Wembley Arena is August, which is a pretty huge space so a fairly good indication of how big it is. http://sneakerness.com/events/london-2015/"
AskUK,3c3u0h,ampmz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:18:38 2015 UTC,Really? I'm 23 and had never heard of this. I buy decent trainers but I wear them to death. I don't know anyone who collects them. At the moment I wear air max or converse depending on what I'm doing. They're tatty as anything but they're well used.

AskUK,3c4n2c,ashuri,4,Sat Jul 4 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"It's not a case of if you can pay, you'll get in unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your view). if you don't meet their entry requirements they'll more than likely turn you away (except for special circumstances). It's not especially difficult to get in though, I have just got onto a MSc course at a Russell Group, I needed a 2.1 and got it - simple as that. Though I do have a thorough understanding of the subject and had already spoken to the programme leader before hand. I applied for 1, as I had little doubt I wouldn't get in. I know some people who have applied for 4 or 5 though, and there is no harm in doing that. In fact I'd say it's a good idea, never put all them eggs in one basket.  Per year. I've not seen any universities listing per term prices only, they might break it down into payments per term but they will almost certainly clearly display the full annual price. Though almost all UK universities allow you to pay with some level of flexibility, rather than in one lump sum. They will almost certainly be aware of reputations within UK universities, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were aware of the reputations of large EU universities. Though obviously the smaller and less well known, the less they'll know. But I wouldn't at all be surprised if they google your institution. For what it's worth I went t an ex-poly and the reputation of my university was not at all a problem for my MSc university, in fact the programme leader went out of her way to say that if an applicant can display my academic capabilities and get a 2.1 (which applications should be doing regardless of academic background in terms of uni) she wouldn't ever turn down an applicant simply for doing their bachelors at a 'less reputable' university - and for what it's worth the Russell Group uni I am attending is one of the globally leading universities, with a very good reputation for my course. Most universities will offer you some sort of flexibility. Most will give you a time limit though, so you can't just study indefinitely. For example my course will not allow you to take more than 3 years to complete the MSc. But obviously you would have to structure your time around when the teaching is being done on a taught masters - you couldn't really just decide to have a few months off half way through a term I wouldn't imagine.   Good luck to your girlfriend mate."
AskUK,3c4n2c,forgottenoldusername,3,Sat Jul 4 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the lengthy response! Really appreciated. I have one clarification, especially in regards to our first point. We didn't mean to imply that we could someone bypass the application processing by paying, the point was that if you have funding AND you meet all the requirements for grades etc (and have a good cover letter, for example) is there any other barrier to the application being accepted? Basically we want to live in the same city so its probably not worth to apply to univerisites all over the country and just focus on the few nearest ones."
AskUK,3c4n2c,forgottenoldusername,2,Sat Jul 4 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"especially in regards to our first point. We didn't mean to imply that we could someone bypass the application processing by paying,    Sorry, didn't meant to imply that's what you meant - though reading back my comment does come across like that so sorry again!   the point was that if you have funding AND you meet all the requirements for grades etc (and have a good cover letter, for example) is there any other barrier to the application being accepted?   Obviously I don't work for an admissions team, but from all of the talks I've had with the admissions team for my MSc and my general understanding, I would say you'd be in a very good position. Meeting the requirements, a good covering letter and funding are the main concerns, a strong reference from an employer/staff member at your previous university will strengthen the application even more (and in fact, for many courses at least 2 references are a must!)  I'd say it's well worth writing a quick email to the admissions team at the university you are looking at. In my experience they the admissions teams for postgrad courses are amazingly helpful, and while they might not be able to say for certain you'll get a place they'll certainly give you a very good idea, which would put your mind at ease if you want to focus on just the one university.   If the university happens to be the Uni of Manchester by any chance then I'd be happy to tell you a bit more about the application process (though to be honest I've mentioned most of it already!)"

AskUK,3c4n2c,carmen_verandah,2,Sat Jul 4 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"UK universities will know about degrees from German unis. They'll know the difference between traditional unis and Hochschulen, and that a degree from a decent Hochschule is perfectly acceptable. They will also know that German degrees take longer than UK degrees. She is not at a disadvantage in this.  I'm not sure how fees are listed for the university in mind, I would suggest you contact them directly for proper information.  Russell group universities generally apply the same entrance requirements for foreign entrants that they do of home entrants. If she has a decent degree, can write a good application and perform well in an interview, convincing them of her interest and capabilities, and has a decent academic reference, she'll be judged the same as UK applicants. The only difference is that she'll be required to prove her English language skills.  Definitely target the places your gf would like to go to. It's not like UCAS. However, consider that it may be more worthwhile for you to move in order for her to get the best possible Masters, rather than her 'settling' for a not so good one just so she can move to where you are. Of course, this doesn't apply if your target course is great or there are reasons why you two should stay where you already are.  I second the suggestion to contact the post-grad admissions team for the uni in which your girlfriend is interested. They're there to help, not scare people off."

AskUK,3c2aw0,Samitte,26,Sat Jul 4 02:37:11 2015 UTC,"I completely understand your frustrations. Unfortunately, the nightclub issue isn't something you can really argue. The standard response everyone will give is that you willingly moved to an area with clubs and should have expected that sort of noise. They were there before you, after all.  The poor quality of the flat is potentially something you could complain about, however. Shelter have a section on their site about this which may be useful."

AskUK,3c2aw0,Kikinho90,3,Sat Jul 4 05:52:53 2015 UTC,"Before you move somewhere you need to check out both inside and outside the property. Outside - roads, are they noisy? What are they like in rush hour? At two in the morning? Go and sit around at two on a Sunday morning. Are there loads of people coming home from a night out making a noise? Saturday and Sunday in the day, are there screaming kids? Inside - always flush the toilet (bitter experience) and check out the electrical fuse box (again, bitter experience). Turn the taps on and off, and the cooker. A nice new paint job generally means mould will soon grow there, as it has been done to cover up previous mould.  You need to start looking for somewhere else and hand your notice in when you have found it."

I've seen many great nightclubs closed down due to residents complaints. The agency should have informed you of the noise from the nightclubs/bars and any street noise above 60db from within the property with the windows closed, many people (like me) would kill to live next to/above a nightclub with pumping music as tinnitus sufferers need constant noise to be able to sleep.

They then started putting complaints in about the park, noise, firework displays late closing, concerts.

AskUK,3c2aw0,throwawaytribute1,-11,Sat Jul 4 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Step one.  Stop paying rent. Step two. Ask for the gas and electrical safety certificates. When was the wiring last checked? If the plumbing is also not up to par then they should have told you about these things.  Stop paying rent. Tell them you either want to move up... Or you want the whole place rewired, the toilet and plumbing fixed and will not be paying a stick of rent until that work is complete.  You may find the agency a little more helpful then"
AskUK,3c2aw0,theBreadSultan,11,Sat Jul 4 08:24:20 2015 UTC,"DO NOT STOP PAYING RENT.  That's terrible advice, give the agency a list of what needs to be done, contact the council to inspect the place if you think it's dangerous. Consult with Shelter on the proper way to go about this. The only situation in which 'stop paying rent' won't come back to bite you  on the bum is if you have given your landlord adequate time to do repairs, have a paper chain to prove that, and inform him that you are withholding rent to pay to get the repairs done yourself."
AskUK,3c2aw0,the_vig,-6,Sat Jul 4 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"Holding back the rent is the best thing to do.  That doesn't mean...don't pay the rent and spend the money.  As the tenant..the law is on your side.  If you say to a landlord ir agency, I'm not happy...but here have Â£1000 anyway. They will do fuck all. Because next month...you will just pay then again.  So the most profitable thing for the agency or landlord to do is to just keep taking your money, until you get fed up and leave, then they rent it to the next victim.  If you hold back the rent, and they cant just re-rent the flat...you are causing them issues. At which point your issues become their issues.  Best thing to do...write them a letter or email stating you will be witholding the rent until certain issues are sorted.  Remember the only person who can evict you is a Judge.  You have so many rights. If agency or landlord try anything...just dial 999 and tell the police you are being illegally evicted or harassed etc. They know that only a tiny amount of illegal evictions get reported, and the law is totally on your side... They will come down on the landlord hard"
AskUK,3c2aw0,theBreadSultan,8,Sat Jul 4 10:29:42 2015 UTC,"It really isn't. Shelter, who know the law better than you say specifically not to stop paying the rent.

AskUK,3c2aw0,philipwhiuk,-5,Sat Jul 4 10:32:43 2015 UTC,"As a charity, and being official, shelter are limited in the advice they can give. In most cases its fine. If you think your landlord is going to break your legs...probably a good idea to pay the rent.  You are holding all of the cards. You have the property. You have control of the revenue stream that property has. You are protected by the law, and unless you cause criminal damage, are pretty much untouchable. Meanwhile your landlord is walking through a legal minefield. Chances are, not getting the rent, or interruption in rent is gonna have a big impact on them.  You will also have...in your account...the full rent anyway, so that means you can close liabilities if you want / need in seconds.  Eviction wont stop you renting elsewhere...thats just complete rubbish. And if you get a reference hurdle its VERY simple to overcome and you would have to actually be simple for that to ever cause you any issues.  You are not using the judicial system to fix problems... You are forcing the shyster agency that conned you and exists only to leach hard earned cash from you and the owner of the flat...to provide you with what they led you to believe you were getting. If they want to take it to court instead of fixing the issue, that is their prerogative, but the law is on your side anyway.  They have been dishonest, that gos far in court, if it ever gets that far, judge will probably order a lower rent be liable, or rent not payable. They won't take it to court tho, because they will be fucked if they do and will know that.  If you want to hold back rent but don't want to be too confrontational, then hold back half or a portion, explain you appreciate they have costs etc...but this really wont do  Pro tip for the future... When you go to move out, don't expect the landlord to give you your deposit back, just don't pay the final months rent and skip into the sunset, they can use deposit for final months rent"

You really aren't untouchable by any stretch of the imagination.   They have been dishonest, that gos far in court,   Court costs are prohibitively expensive and unless you have a lie in writing it's not worth much. There's probably not evidence in OPs case that they did lie. Merely that he failed to ask the right questions.   to provide you with what they led you to believe you were getting   Being led to believe something isn't a legal defense. OP visited the place and saw it.   Pro tip for the future... When you go to move out, don't expect the landlord to give you your deposit back, just don't pay the final months rent and skip into the sunset, they can use deposit for final months rent   Really stupid:  a) Deposits aren't held by the landlord / estate agent. If they are, you should go after them for breaking the law - you get far more than the deposit back and you won't need the court for this - I'm fairly sure the council can enforce this.  b) Deposits are often more than a month's rent"
AskUK,3c2aw0,philipwhiuk,-4,Sat Jul 4 11:45:52 2015 UTC,"Ok so first up. You are NOT squatting,  Squatting is taking possession through occupation of an empty property to which you have managed to gain access without breaking and entering.  Regarding court costs. They are not actually that much at all and you are not necessarily liable to pay the other parties legal fees...  Not to mention, if it gos to court, it will probably go in your favour, the landlord knows this... Even IF a judge evicts you, its not hard to get a generous notice of months if you can show good reason, or hardship.  Being led to believe something that is untrue is a defence, because that person is committing fraud, also by writing to the landlord/agency, you are covering yourself, so again...if it gets bought to court but there was a clear way to resolve the issue outside court...then again...that gos in your favour.  If you paid more than one months rent as deposit you are a mug...and are getting mugged off...there is no reason to charge more.  And yea...trust the landlord not to create bullshit reasons why you are not getting your deposit back, at which point you will have to take then to small claims court...good luck with that."
AskUK,3c2aw0,theBreadSultan,2,Sat Jul 4 12:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'll bite:   Ok so first up. You are NOT squatting   correct. You are in rent arrears though, meaning you can be forcibly evicted and sued for the rent you havent paid.   Regarding court costs. They are not actually that much at all    they absolutely can be a lot, something going through civil/small claims courts can still involve lawyers.   and you are not necessarily liable to pay the other parties legal fees...   sure. And since you're not necessarily gonna get caught robbing a bank, there's no reason not to try it.    Not to mention, if it gos to court, it will probably go in your favour, the landlord knows this...    uh, what? You're saying they should immediately start withholding rent without even telling the landlord there need to be repairs done, when withholding rent is already something that you have to do very carefully in the UK to avoid legal trouble.  putting it clearly: Under UK law, there is no provision for withholding rent without giving warning to the landlord. You are not protected in any way if you choose to withhold the rent, and I can pretty much guarantee that if you did that here, you would be evicted and you would be paying the landlord the full rent amount anyway.  the only situation in which you can withhold rent without being at risk of eviction is given here on page 22: http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/23392/ShelterGuide_GettingRepairsDone.pdf  which is clearly not OP's situation.    Even IF a judge evicts you, its not hard to get a generous notice of months if you can show good reason, or hardship.   You can't just make up a reason and expect a judge to believe it, and you necessarily get notice longer than 2 weeks.    .if it gets bought to court but there was a clear way to resolve the issue outside court...then again...that gos in your favour.   bhahahaha, yeah. If you go to court and tell them you started ""withholding rent"" with no notice and that you contacted the letting agent after you stopped paying, that's totally going to go in your favour. Complete slam dunk, no judge would possibly rule against someone who completely ignored all the procedures for getting repairs done and decided to just stop paying.   If you paid more than one months rent as deposit you are a mug...and are getting mugged off...there is no reason to charge more.   OP's deposit is almost definitely in a protection scheme and OP won't have much difficulty getting it back, when he gets evicted for following your advice."
AskUK,3c2aw0,bearjuani,-1,Sat Jul 4 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Which part of...send your landlord a letter or better yet an email did you not understand?  Rent is paid monthly, when dealing with agencies, so in reality they are giving the agency plenty of notice.  No judge is going to rule that having a pipe leak into a cupboard and a toilet that uses your hot water is acceptable for the tenant.  While the home is no where near the threshold for ""not fit for human habitation"" As they did not have these faults implicitly described to them, and a prospective tenant would reasonably assume that the plumbing was in order unless otherwise informed to the contrary, it can be argued that an accurate description of the property was not given, and thus any contract entered into was not done so in good faith on all parties, or with all facts apparent.  All contracts in the UK must be fair and reasonable, otherwise they are not worth the paper they are written on.  And you can go through life expecting landlords to pay back deposits if you like. I prefer the safer option of just leaving the house with everything square and no monies being owed.  Did you enjoy your nibble?"

AskUK,3c1e2q,anonben,4,Fri Jul 3 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"Do you guys have Sky? I'd suggest watching something called RedZone. It's effectively a Match of the Day for the NFL, but live. It shows all the big plays - whether it's a touchdown, interception, big hit or a field goal all live every Sunday during the NFL season. It runs from 6pm till about 2am on the Sky Red Button and it's a good way to get used to the teams and the players. If you want to understand the game more I would suggest watching more full games but RedZone is a really good way to find a team you like and get into the sport!

What's available depends on who has what rights, and that varies by season. The Super Bowl is always on one of the free channels.  If you want something more in-depth, you can subscribe to NFL Gamepass, which can be a bit expensive, but gives you so much coverage. You get 24 hour NFL Network, almost every regular season game live (except the two or three per week which Sky buy the rights to, which you have to wait 24 hours for). All games are archived, too. Oh, and RedZone, which is basically insane and a way to watch every live game at once.  For baseball, you can subscribe to MLB.TV which is slightly cheaper and gives you every single game, including the post-season, live and also archived. Just being an MLB.tv member without paying gives you access to one live free game per day, but don't expect it to be Red Sox at Yankees. If you're happy with highlights, MLB posts a whole load of stuff on its YouTube channel every day.  Nascar also archives every Sprint and Xfinity race on its YouTube channel, too."

I've spent countless hours sending emails and never getting replies; instead find a company and ring them up. Tell them what you're after and what they have to gain from taking you on.  Volunteering can be great if it's something you are genuinely passionate about. If you're just working in a charity shop then it's okay but it won't make for very interesting conversation during an interview. Instead find something more active where you work with people or animals. I myself was with Wildlife Trust for a bit and once a week we'd go round different nature reserves to do conservation work.

Second bit of experience was a summer job I got through Uni - lecturer put me forward when a businessman with Uni ties was looking for someone. Proper bit of programming, so very useful.

Most degrees that are full-time, you'll only be in lectures, labs, seminars or whatever, for what seems like part-time each week. This is because you are expected to top that up yourself by reading your textbooks and doing work in the library or wherever in your own time. Treat it like a 9-5 and you'll do great!

Chances are the first box will have something that suggests there's a thorough understanding of material outside of the course. Mention of stuff but not necessarily developed usually bags you towards the top end of a 2.1. Knowing what it is you need to do is key.  Plus if you have any coursework and would like to know where you can improve you can set a time with the course tutor to discuss it.

Also particularly useful where PhD students are used for marking work (lab reports or tutorials).  If it doesn't there's no harm in asking them to put one together as a guide!

AskUK,3bzcgf,reketrebn,3,Fri Jul 3 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"As a university employee...this stuff does not have to exist.  Justifying to an external examiner can simply consist of saying ""this question asked for a basic fact from lectures and the student didn't give that fact. Therefore they do not deserve a first"".  A lot of staff are actually adverse to providing a mark scheme as there's the impression that it makes students too reliant on learning the structure of an exam rather than learning the material that the exam is looking at."
AskUK,3bzcgf,danltn,3,Fri Jul 3 13:59:28 2015 UTC,"I think I can chime in on this one.  So I did a four year MEng in Computer Science at a Russell Group University and received a strong First in each year, climaxing with 90% in my final (Masters) year.  My advice is to understand clearly what needs to be learnt and understood to receive good marks.  At my Universtiy the majority of marks were from exams.  When you know what needs to be known, get a small group of good, intelligent friends, sit down and then learn every single thing that needs to be learnt (easy, huh?).  Most modules divide nicely into about 5-15 sections, learn each section; do spot tests on each other until you've all both memorised and fully understood something.  You know you understand something when you can teach it to someone.  Now of course, this will take time, it's not instant to learn an entire module so the most important thing is to dedicate time to this.  Working in a small group usually helps for testing yourselves but some prefer to read the material on their own before-hand.  When it comes to coursework, the trick is to start immediately and get as much feedback as is permitted from as many people as possible to make your work as good as possible.  If you're going to leave everything to the last minute (as some of you inevitably will do), make sure you still work together to test each other.  It's so easy to miss topics or misunderstand things when working alone.  Fwiw, I didn't really attend lectures very often.  Ask me anything else."
AskUK,3bzcgf,Eloquai,5,Fri Jul 3 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"Political science.  Read the feedback on your assignments! I cannot stress this enough. Throughout my first year, I received bad mark after bad mark, but never stopped to consider why this was happening. The feedback on your work is there partly to help you stop making the same mistakes again. Read it carefully, and don't be afraid to sit down with your tutors and academic advisor to discuss any queries you might have.  I won't lie and say that I planned my work carefully and completed assignments long in advance - much of my coursework was written in caffeine-fuelled 3am sessions and most of my final dissertation was written over a prolonged week-long stay in the library. The key though is to make sure you work in a matter that suits you. Some people are incredibly organised and others are not, some people need the adrenaline rush of a rapidly approaching deadline and others do not. If you can find your groove early, you'll be alright when it comes to the critical assignments.

They'll give you the main works but try to really familiarise yourself with the history of debate on your topics, the major standpoints and interpretations and the big names.  Know your details. When it comes to exams, don't just trot out the same facts as everyone else, have a bit of extra insight or detail on something that'll set you apart.  If you have to do an individual study, do something off the beaten path. I've been marking 2nd year archaeology presentations recently, and by far the most interesting are the people choosing sites that haven't been already covered in seminars or have had dozens of books written about them.  Time management is crucial. Not just making sure you get things in on time, but making sure that you give yourself enough time to do proper research, draft and edit properly. If you get swamped, you'll rush and cut corners.  Remember to take some time off too. Go to the pub, call your mum, spend all day on the sofa watching netflix, whatever.

There is a clear understanding of taught ideas and content, and a very sound ability to analyse and synthesise material. Taught skills demonstrate competence and the work is well presented.   70-80% - Work of a distinguished quality based on wide-ranging research that is initially tutor led, but is enhanced by selfdirected enquiry.

I can't say ""put in every hour of work that you can"" or ""don't party"" because that would be hypocritical, but here are the things I did that I think helped (it's quite design-specific but can probably apply to other fields to):   Lecturers shouldn't be teaching you everything. This isn't school, the internet exists and you have no excuse for not learning the software skills you need (same for any programming course, imo). You have all the information in the world at your fingertips. Get involved with the industry. The more you are exposed to what real people in the profession are doing, the better you'll understand what good quality design is. Go to conferences. Network. Read about what's going on in your industry. It will pull up your standards. Be really critical. Ok, students aren't necessarily expected to produce industry standard work yet, but you have to learn what good design looks like and understand where your work needs improvement. You don't have to agree with what you say in your dissertation, you just have to tick the boxes. If you struggle with essay writing (or dyslexia, which affects a lot of people on creative courses), get support from the university, that's what it's there for. Don't leave deadlines until the last minute. Ok, it's kind of fun in the first year, I helped a few of my friends pull all-nighters, but in general I never understood why some people struggled so much to do their work in good time.

Try and enjoy what you're doing it makes it a lot easir to spend 12+ hours a day doing it. Past exam papers are you're friend as the courses don't change a great deal year to year. Read things in your subject area that you do not study (all scientists should read Nature and Science cover to cover every week). If you go to a smaller uni (oxbridge, st andrews, duram) try and befriend your lectures. Try and eat somewhat healthy and drink pleanty of water, it helps you focus.

I didn't do much reading around until 3rd/4th year, as it wouldn't have made that much of a difference in 1st/2nd year exams. Not to say it wouldn't have helped, but I didn't. In later years, the lecturers will commonly be lecturing directly on their research area, so having a few examples from the lit to throw in looks good, and might boost your marks. For us, some lecturers required outside reading for full marks, others explicitly didn't, so finding out about that is handy.  Past papers, and developing exam technique is crucial. There's no point writing a full page for a 4 mark answer, and you'll need more than a few lines for a 10 mark answer. Some lecturers will recycling old questions over and over again. You can't rely on this fully, but if he's asked questions from the same pool of 4/5 for the past 10 years, it's fairly likely that won't change. Still know the rest of the course, but having answers developed for these will save you time in the exam.  Try to thoroughly understand the underlying concepts of things, it's a far more effective way to learn, you can then apply your understanding to questions. This will also help you develop better answers.  I'm another one who couldn't work in the library, I much preferred to work from home, where there's a kettle and all my food. The trick is finding somewhere you can work comfortably and effectively.  Remember to actually take breaks and stuff. If you just work for 10/12 hours flat, you'll burn out and waste your time. Find a system that works for you, but when you're working, work, try to get in the zone and knuckle down. A few hours of quality work is much more effective than a day's worth of fucking around.  As above, do the work. In STEM, coursework, in whatever form it takes (lab reports, essays, etc.) is a relatively easy way to boost your marks, and take pressure off the exams.  If you have small group tutorials, go to these, and do the work. As you'll be going through this in a group of 5/6 with an academic, they're excellent ways to highlight any misunderstandings.  That's all I can think of at the minute. Hope it helps."

Another tip would be to make sure your 'study' friends are atleast studious, if not First Classer's too.

My course also had practical classes (even more than lectures) so go to them if your course has them. All of them. Don't skip anything if you can help it. If you need to take notes, do it.  If you are doing badly and you feel as though you are giving it your all on all of your modules then adapt to a triage strategy, focus on certain modules over others to boost some of your grades over others. I'd only advise this if you are burning out. That being said always submit coursework (if you have coursework for that module) on time for every module as every mark can help.  If you are working on something at uni and need to go home or are starting to get bored, go home and do it there if you can after a break, don't burn out.  Study/Research/Work on Coursework in your spare time when you can, but obviously live a little. I'm probably not the best example for this tip as I spent hardly any time studying/researching in my spare time and more time (all of it :P) playing video games. But I did do my coursework whenever inspiration struck or as soon as I personally started to feel like I was falling behind.  If your coursework has a marking spec, read it. Tick off things you have done and mark things you haven't done. Don't submit a coursework until you can safely say you've done everything or enough of the spec. After you're satisfied with regards to the coursework spec, only then do something that isn't on the spec that makes your submission unique as by doing the coursework you should have learned enough to experiment so do that to elevate your submission from good/B territory into great/A territory. Don't do what some people on my course did (and I did at the start of my honours project! :D )  and bite off more than you can chew at the start of a coursework and then burn out and have nothing to submit rather than a solid base that would have picked you up some marks.  As difficult as it is, do not procrastinate. If you feel like you need to do something then last week was the best time to do it, right now is the second best time, not tomorrow, not the weekend, now. Time you spend not doing coursework or revision or research or study is time you need to make up later at the end which ends up being all night crunches, which does no good for yourself physically and mentally, especially before exams.  On that note. Sleep.   In exams, focus on what you know for definite, read questions carefully but quickly, if you don't know it move on and come back.  Above all, enjoy your course, if you don't like what you are doing then purely by nature you won't put as much effort in to succeed. Don't kid yourself either, if you don't like your course and you have a chance to change do so at the earliest opportunity if you can.

Work at it for 8-9 hours a day, do overtime if necessary.  Take 'tea breaks' every few hours and go for a walk for an hour for your 'lunch break,' taking a notebook with you. This will clear your head a bit and you can note down anything that comes to you while you're out so you can look into later when you're back to work.

Just being at a lecture won't help, if you aren't engaging with the lecturer and the content.   2) The reason the deadlines are set far away in the future isn't so you can procrastinate and then prioritise, it's because achieving 70% in that particular assignment will probably take that long.   3) [bonus] don't be afraid to ask other students, I had a good group of mates on the same course, and we all took it seriously.

Another thing to do is to make sure you really understand what good work looks like (particularly important if you are doing an essay subject). Go to relevant tutors and talk about your project and what you can do to improve it before it is handed in. A study group is a good idea - you get to see the habits of other successful people, motivate each other, get other people to check your work, and crib hints and tips about the subject matter. In your edit, you say you don't have many people on your course who are your friends. This doesn't matter. You don't want to study with friends because they will distract you. You want to study with people who are talented and good at the subject. Try to identify people who are high performers and driven to do well and try to get a study group going with them. They will turn up by themselves because they are already motivated. I recognise it can be scary trying to get people you don't know to do things but you want to be successful, and successful people reach out to people who can help them, and surround themselves with people on the same mission as them."

AskUK,3bzcgf,reketrebn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"Okay just reading through before 'send' and this is going to make me sound proper machiavellian but I only noticed this really in hindsight that I did this stuff. Got me my first though so shrug!. And of course can only describe what I've learned for essay-based courses only:  1) Read the literature, journal articles and academic articles from reputable sources. It's not about the quantity - but pay attention to it. Learn how they use language. You want to be able to write like that.  I once overheard a professor at one of the top 10 unis in the UK say they could usually tell whether an essay was going to be a first by reading the top page. It's how you articulate yourself that demonstrates how much you've read over the course (and let's be honest, the depth you understood). It is a massive advantage to you, and in my personal opinion with some of the more 'critical courses' that let you interpret and analyse things with 'no right answers' it is just as important as what you're actually even writing to argue.  2) Try to learn what leanings your professor has. Not the obvious stuff - it'll be an offhand comment like ""some might argue such-and-such, if you're feeling a little more adventurous in your reading"" or ""some refer to the arguments of X if you want to be black and white about it"" that just give you a little insight into the discussions that they find interesting. Write about that. Another underhanded way to do this is to look at their faculty page on the schools' network and see what they've written their papers on and allude to those schools of thought in your own reading. You have to be EXTREMELY subtle and careful about this and use it with a pinch of salt. If they're writing loads about championing trade union engagement and participation in HR management you can be a little more free with taking a more left-leaning stance on your own essay's argument.   2) Try to learn what the popular arguments in your class. Write your essay accordingly. If it looks like everyone is going to take a similar argument against an essay question, try to undermine that by critically analyzing the ways that popular argument is flawed. Your essay will stand out more after you've marked 20 papers all arguing against the rising popularity of complementary and alternative medicines, at least it will be refreshing to read ""In my paper I'm going to argue against this, but NOT using the conventional arguments as they don't appreciate x, y, z."" or even ""A common knee-jerk response is to argue against the rising popularity, but actually I'm going to demonstrate this is short sighted because x, y, z"" - the downside to this one is you've got to actually read the books, know your stuff and be half decent at writing to be able to really hit this one home but it's a great tactic when you're trying to think of an angle to approach the essay."

Or at the worst I see no reason why you couldn't repeat your first year (not ideal, but if it lets you continue).  Why did you fail, if you don't mind me asking? Did you give it your 100% or was it a case of missed lectures and missing coursework?"
AskUK,3byv05,glovesfox,4,Fri Jul 3 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"After the first semester examinations I had a talk with my academic advisor he told me I would be expelled if I didn't get better results next semester. I asked him if I would be able to retake the year if that happened, he said I'd be able to resit the exams/resubmit essays if I passed at least half of the modules. I didn't.  It's really complicated... Multiple reasons, I think. For one, the system here, the teaching and learning style was completely different from what I was used to at school back home. Like I said, I had very good results at school, I was the top of my class, but I was one of these people who would slack off for most of the year, not do homework, skip a lot of classes but prepare hard for the important things like tests, essays and exams. Also, the teachers were always very clear about therequirements and instructions. I just wasn't used to disciplining myself and working hard all the time, not only in occasional bursts when I absolutely had to. So at the beginning of the first semester I was overwhelmed and at first I tried to keep up, and later it got easier but then... I don't even know what happened, it was probably that nobody was holding my hand like at school and I thought I could get away with skipping more lectures and tutorials, not submitting assignments if I realized they were too difficult and I wouldn't be able to get a good grade anyway, procrastinated a lot, etc.  The funny thing is that I absolutely fell in love with my course. It's social anthropology. I still did most of the readings and loved most of the lectures and actively participated in tutorials, I've read a lot of articles and books on anthropology in my free time. I guess in the end it was just my lack of discipline and unwillingness to put more work than I was used to. I'm in absolute despair now and I haven't even told my parents yet. I'm almost more heart-broken at shattering their hopes about me than at my own future."

You'll also need to speak to the student loans people and see if you can get an extra years money to cover all your costs and everything. If you can demonstrate to the Uni that you have the funds to have another go at first year I see no reason why they wouldn't take your money and let you back in.  That said, I've seen A LOT of people in your position before (source: my own degree(s) and 4 years working for a university). I have to tell you that the majority of poeple resit first year a couple of times, fail 2nd year and then drop out completely with just as much debt as their graduate friends but nothing to show for it. Do you REALLY think you'll do any better if you get another chance?  Tell your parents what's happened. They won't be mad and will help you to make a better decision about what is right for you.

Simply passing a degree is not worth the sheer cost of taking it; you really need to come out with a 2:1 or above.  Now, I am not saying give up, but what I am saying is that you need to rethink your options. I, for one, waited a number of years before going to university as I was not mature enough to buckle down and do what was needed. Go away for a bit, rethink your life priorities and perhaps do some distance learning study to get skilled up - the open university is fantastic for not only teaching you a subject but also teaching you how to study.  Also, you need to think about how your student visa is affected by this. Now is not the time in this country to be having a visa mix up!!!"

I'll be 21 in a month, I can't waste any more time or else I won't graduate until I'm in my late 20s while everybody else are already having full-time jobs in their field at 23.  And it's not just about that - like I said, I really love anthropology. The reason I failed was because I hard a shitty work ethic, procrastinated too much and generally didn't work too hard also didn't do some things the right way, didn't find out the exact requirements, etc. I still feel like I've learned a great deal of things this year and grown so much intellectually, even as a failed year I consider it far from wasted.

But I really know that I love anthropology, and I loved studying it at uni. Like I said, I've been spending a lot of time learning about it on my free time and not just for course work, reading books, articles, watching documentaries, etc. I was just too lazy and undisciplined to put in more work when I had to.  I did look at other subjects and the only other subject I'm equally into is Japanese. I've been studying it for 2 years. I actually had a very hard time choosing between Japanese and anthropology when I first applied to UCAS. One other option might be sociology but I'm not as interested in it as anthropology."

If it's a case that you know you didn't work hard enough even after getting warned you were so close to been expelled well there's an element of why should they let you waste more time doing retakes.

For example, in my degree, you were allowed two unexplained absences per course. A third unexplained absence resulted in an automatic penalty of 10% of your grade for the module, a fourth - you fail the module. Essays and assignments during the module counted towards grade, as did a final piece of work - which was project or essay based. I did a total of 3 timed, or exam, pieces.  If you only got 20% in an exam based course (when you were 'preparing a lot for the exams and everything'), I would question whether a degree in your subject is appropriate.

However, they told me there's a much better chance of transferring to another degree than retaking the year. Doesn't make sense to me at all, but in that case at least I have a few more options right now. I checked the undergraduate courses for 2015 and apparently they have Japanese and sociology now - the subjects I had been seriously considering besides anthropology. I've been learning Japanese with a private tutor for 2 years and I really love it, languages are one of my stronger sides. Or I could try to apply to another uni through Clearing, but I've been told that I should explain my situation to them instead of just offering the school resulsts as if this year didn't even exist, so the chances that they'd take me aren't high either. I won't be able to speak to my academic advisor until Monday."

A lot of companies are dissolved now. There only one left that's active now.  The second trading address is some solicitor's address. It's no use checking them as there are over 500 companies at this address.  There's third address but it's not listed as an trading or registered office address.

It was also  a bugbear that charities dealing with poverty could not easily pay someone living in poverty to act as a trustee. But it does look as though the recent overhaul of charity regulations has opened a needed route.   The modern guidance is here and says you can do it if your governing documents explicitly permit it. I believe this is new,  and will not apply to longer-established charities unless they have overhauled their documentation.  Notice the hoops that you have to go through. No trustee should be able to get fat that way. Few treasurers would attempt  any substantial  arrangement of that type without discussing it with the CC (who are actually very approachable and helpful).  EDIT: Apologies for not checking the current regs before answering. It had been a long-established principle.

I am so glad I now own a place.

The landlord eventually admitted the excessive charges were ""his time"" to which the judge laughed and said he decided to be a landlord, it's not up to tenants to pay him for that decision.  Tell the landlord you will fight it with the DPS and if necessary court then get some legal advice, no court will back up charges like this.

Of course there is preliminary work like surveys and things which need to be done which also require cones so having them there permanently does make all that kind of thing easier too.

AskUK,3bv7op,Treczoks,3,Fri Jul 3 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"It can be worse... In ye olden days, our computer club HQ was in a garage. We had power, but no telephone service. So we asked the phone company for two lines. Waiting time: six months (as I said, olden days, and no competition to drive them).  About eight months later, some people turned up and dug a hole in the pavement, abot 10m from our garage. They set up barriers, signs, and lights, and left.  Two days later, another team showed up. They closed the first hole without doing anything in it, dug a second hole ony 5m from our garage, set up barriers, signs, and lights, and left.  Another two days later, a third team showed up and moved the hole again. But now right next to the garage, where it should have been from the beginning.  Next day, instead of a truck like before, a car shows up. Guy gets out, puts on a white helmet (here a sign of an engineer or architect on a building site), grabs a clipboard, and comes over to the current hole. He looks into the hole, examines the papers on his clipboard, looks in the hole again, marks something off on his clipboard, returns to his car, and leaves again.  Again one or two days later a small transporter arrives with two guys and the licence to solder. We get our hopes up that finally something might happen. We even ordered another two lines a few months ago, but they told us that their working orders were to put a cable with only two pairs, and that the order for the other two pairs had not reached their department yet, so they could not install a cable with four pairs.  To connect such a branch, they have a tool that cuts off the insulation off the big main cable that was running there, then they search for the right wires to connect the branch and install a normal-sized sleeve around this. But this time someone had set the cutting tool to the wrong setting, and it did not only cut the insulation but also one to two layers of the outer wires in the cable. A few dozen homes were without phone service. Now they had to make a bigger cut to fix the outer wires first, but they hadn't had the bigger sleeve they needed to re-seal everything. Getting the right sleeve, fixing the cables and finally adding the soon-obsolete two pairs branch cable took them a whole day.  A few days later, another team came, dug a trench through the neighbors garden (with his permission, of course) nearly to the place where a hole in the wall was needed to get the line trough. To our utter amazement, the same team also closed the hole in the pavement.  Aaaaand another guy came about a week later. His job was basically to drill a hole in the wall, push the cable trough and install the telephone socket. We had told them in advance that he would need a long drill, because the garden (which was about 1m higher than our garage, buried an old and thick foundation just under the lawn level, so he would have to drill through the garage wall and the foundation. We knew about this, because we had already run a cable through this wall to connect the neigbor to our local network. We had to cut a drill and weld a meter of rebar into it to drill the hole, so we knew what to expect.  So this guy brought a ""large"" drill (80cm long) which of course failed to get through. He rejected to use our drill or let us doing the drilling with it for safety/insurance reasons, so he left unfinished. Finally, about another week later, someone lese came and brough a sufficiently long drill and a gargantuan machine to plug it into, and we finally got our two lines installed! Horray!  Aftermath: Nobody cared about the trench in the neighbors garden, so two weeks later he complained to the phone company which had totally forgotten about this. Sometimes later, they actally fixed it, including rolled sod to fix the lawn.  A few days later we got the confirmation that the two other lines will be installed soon..."

AskUK,3bv7op,jonewer,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"No, but that isn't a good argument. Most commercial vehicles are speed capped anyway, it doesn't make much difference to them (if a vehicle's speed is reduced from 60 to 50 mph you'd need 50 miles of road works to take 10 minutes off their journey), also, 50mph is actually a more efficient speed limit, as cars drive closer together and so more cars can get through in an set period of time. That's one of the key arguments behind variable speed limits at rush hour. So overall I'd be very surprised if it made a difference."

A lot of work is done at night and sometimes things that can only be done on a full closure have to be done before 'daytime' activities can be done. Contractors only have a limited amount of staff to 'concentrate' work to get it done quicker, plus some time delays can't be avoided, such as letting concrete cure and harden.

AskUK,3bwz8t,itsalllies,5,Thu Jul 2 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"Markets stalls are likely to buy from smaller producers and/or grab bargains where they see them. Supermarket buyers work with much larger producers and longer term contracts. This tends to mean that market stalls will have more variable prices, quality and selection.  On the quality front though price isn't much of an indicator. Even in a supermarket the cheap vs. higher price branding is often just branding. They might sort carrots into cheap and less cheap for consistent sizing or other aesthetic concerns but there's no fundamental reason why the 'smartprice' ones are going to be worse tasting."

With supermarkets, you're paying a premium for convenience (or the perception of convenience), for the subtle cues given off by packaging and other presentation such as lighting and shelving, etc.  Another thing about market produce is that it more honestly reflects what is in season, by the prices and/or the availability. It can make you a little more aware of what in the supermarkets has come from nearby, and what has been flown around the world to meet our demands. Or, to put it another way, the cheapest offers on the market are likely to be those with low carbon footprints."

Standards are high at supermarkets (or supposed to be) and farm shops, with market stalls and greengrocers' surely varying from individual to individual. But with every category of shop, I've had winning and also terrible purchases.  Aldi is a discounter supermarket where the fruit and veg is often great, but also very cheap. Conversely, the big four supermarkets and of course M and S and Waitrose are trying to follow consumer demands by putting the grower's name etc etc on the label.  But though a market stall won't do this, maybe they can be run by people who have good relations with particular suppliers."
AskUK,3bwz8t,tmstms,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"I use my local greengrocers and markets whenever I can. I always assumed it would be more expensive but the difference can be dramatic. Anything in season can be dead cheap - my local place is about 50p a punnet of strawberries at the moment, if anything is starting to get a little bit older they can almost be giving them away. You have to use your eyes a bit more, some fruit and veg might be a bit gnarlier round the edges rather than the perfect wrapped-up specimens you get in a supermarket, but it is often a lot cheaper.  The difference I suppose is supermarkets have to be spot-on each time, all year round. So they will have strawberries from all over the world, then in summer when there is a glut they can say they are ""on offer"" and pile them higher.Looks aren't everything though, they might have ""perfect"" berries, but they will be the larger, bouncier ones rather than soft and unctious. I have had avocados, mangoes, melons, pears and peaches from supermarkets that look lovely but simply never ripen.   Also, as a lot of it is more seasonal, you may not have everything you want 100% of the time. Which makes you think a bit, you can tailor what you are cooking depending on what is there, what looks good and what is cheap."
