If you don't know who she is, she coordinated all of the celebrity AMA's, did most of the stuff for verification, and ensured it was the actual celebrity them-self answering questions to the point of sitting down with them during the AMA in some cases, so she was pretty integral in the functioning of /r/iama. In response /r/iama ""blackedout"" in protest, meaning they went private. Many other subreddits followed suit in protest of the admin's action and against the sheer lack of communication between admins and mods. Many redditors see this as another miss-step in a long line of poorly thought out actions taken by the reddit management that is leading it down the same path Digg took years ago.  edit: Thread about it on the now reactivated /r/iama: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0hcz/welcome_back/"

upvotegifs,3bkt4p,hinowisaybye,4,Tue Jun 30 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that was exactly the effect sought after my friend. I am sure you know the scene well, if not please go watch the movie, its one of the all time great guy movies. This is the full one minute on youtube I made and was going to use but bc of a major computer malfunction couldnt finalize. Anyway, Benecio has a strong accent and you cant make out what he says. In fact he says a different line than on the card with different words than everyone else in the line up. If you notice, and prob why its more hard to read than the movement, is that words are intentionally misspelled to highlight his accent and use of slang, furthermore, I used difficult to read font to again illustrate it . Finally the movement was done to further accent that point. And in big clear bold yellow words, the cops tell him to speak in English, which Benecio took as an insult bc he was speaking English. I guess I was assuming almost everyone knows this scene as its widely popular amongst men. But if you havent seen it, then I get the confusion and hope that cleared it up for you. And if you havent seen it, its a fantastic story and very well acted movie. Its a def must see.

If you think a situation is dangerous enough that you need to get a gun out, you should not go back to a relaxed posture until the situation is fully resolved.  It's human nature to try to deescalate with body language when you want to avoid a fight, but that's counterproductive.  You can say, ""I don't want to hurt you."" while still being ready to defend yourself.  Check out the original video and imagine what would have happened to Jehrardd Williams if Dakota Fields had come back into the Waffle house with a gun and rounded the corner shooting?

If you like superhero shows like Arrow, Flash, or Agents of Shield, then you might like it.  However, I must warn you that it is a much darker and more graphic show than those others.  I'm talking blood, gore, language, etc.  View at your own risk.  This scene has a friend of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) being him a ""Get well soon"" balloon after a night of vigilantism.  His defeated look and the inclusion of such a light-hearted gesture in an otherwise dark show actually gave me a good chuckle"

The game played by cadets at the National Defense Academy of Japan traditionally on its anniversary is famous for its size, wherein two teams of 150 individuals each vie for control of a single large pole.  Each team is split into two groups of 75 attackers and 75 defenders. The defenders begin in a defensive orientation respective to their own pole, while the attackers assume position some measure away from the other team's pole. A team is victorious if it is able to lower the pole of the opposing team (which begins perpendicular to the ground) to a thirty-degree angle (respective to the ground), before the other team reaches this goal. Until a rule-change in 1973, the angle of victory was only forty-five degrees.     Image i - Two squads scrambling for possession of the pole.

She dug holes in everything from linoleum to screen windows, and preferred to sit out in the snow instead of in her giant doghouse full of blankets. Since they were bred as a working (carriage) dog, they need a lot of activity, which isn't for everyone (most definitely not my family).
